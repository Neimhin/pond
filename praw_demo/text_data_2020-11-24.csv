Thank Probably good news. article post breaking couple minutes later. I'd rather read article tweet. I’m glad officials overt messaging, really wish would ramped several weeks ago agree judgement blaming Trump everything related control covid-19 spread within US. Trump result populist anti-intellectualist American people, origin irrational people. However, could argue Trump's four years POTUS encourage popularity stupid stuff. Trump strong political movement rather simple narcissistic political figure. 

BTW: political study student China overwatched US politic system long while, totally Trump. KN95s rigid sort dome around nose mouth collapse. Give try. article states unclear supplying freezers reportedly backorder known manufacturers. That's shocking. Illinois basically lock since March. person visitors unless someone literally deathbed visitors screened infection required wear masks. staff tested 2x week level transmission community. even active cases building. Starting week can't even window visits family sees family window they're trying cut back anyone about. stick around, make worth **WHILE**? Ontario around least 5% positivity rate now, no?a states better that, including New York neighbor makes glad borders closed. large employers also used fight Polo well.

I'm going feel zero empathy morons infected families holiday despite warning warning warning. Zero... OK Cuomo decides want NY's allotment vaccine. clear, I’m addressing people don’t care. work grocery know many us mercy surroundings try stay safe. 
We pockets communities around don’t care. care enough continue protesting without masks. One consistent protest held outside local grocery store. Yeah, outside recently weeks ago marched store. Thanks that! Y'all stay complaining now....
Stop talking hole. 
I sick. still sick.
I asymmetric say was.
I can't walk stairs without breath. know that's like? urge officials get backbone 🤷 One greatest failures response covid putting dangers cost obesity blast. That's Poland now. pretty much achieved capacity tests people stopped testing themselves. Government congratulates lower number sick hospitals dont allow patients. Soon over.. elderly crater death hospitalization rates well. still restrictions less scary hopefully infections flatten. Seatbelts mandated standard equipment cars 1968. usually uncomfortable, overtight monstrosities caused injuries prevented everyone hated wear got habit ignoring. 

States start passing mandates wear 1980s 90s. many states, still secondary offense ticketed get pulled something else. New Hampshire, adults still mandated wear seat belt.

 passed CA lived, 1986, parents scoffed. 1987, car **would move** everyone buckled. Trump delved Somalia. He's continued drone strikes. saber rattling North Korea disruptions old standing foreign policy. We're worse place Iran.

Military spending went slightly 2017 increased every year since. still thousands troops Middle East. done truly get America never ending conflicts except spontaneously removing troops whims. Ooh! Ok, get it.

Not sure downvotes, sorry.

I said ""What?"" understand context. Thanks explaining. finally able convince Dad week stay home gets vaccine first line. He's 70, bit overweight, major heart surgery January gets it, he's done. 

He still planning going Thanksgiving siblings/kids/SO's 15 people begged 3rd time month caved. I'm going either everyone else acted like big deal going kept thinking would fine. 

I probably saved fathers life entire family shrugged off. Mom passed away 20 years ago, like OK dying one wants take care can't live anymore. thats probably least 10 years he's still mentally sound works home like he's deaths doorstep without threat Covid.   I’m jealous country people like you, taking seriously. Protip: you’ve decided defy advice front line medical professionals, don’t sent long email decision 50,000 front line medical professionals. people old enough vote, old enough least google do. 18 year olds either adults not. Can't empower bunch rights say mature enough carry responsibilities go rights  see Thanksgivng ICU Christmas? OMG... imagine upset parents answer gathering... lol. I'd interested know doctor got information. 18th Moderna expecting 20 million vax doses ready US end year. Pfizer took order 100 million doses US idea whether order filled. think also ordered another 100 million Johnson &amp; Johnson. idea production either. 

I would genuinely love know doses exist ready go out, seen reported anywhere. covid hospitalizations. keeping track stats covid. strange questions regarding CELLECTRA device. device DOD already placed $71,000,000 order June. You’d think they’d done prerequisite homework then, know! 

Hopefully trial, resumed (or least given go ahead resume, goes well. real news network... Social Media better looking rules Corporate chains last places go. Also tips make difference ever! absolutely amusing react way children better future. know hate much. I'm speaking 'herd immunity' resistance....  people heads far ass need proctologist talk them. waste time, kind. Still used too. say model accounts post thanksgiving post christmas surges. could hit 20 million christmas.

Get n99 masks. 3m 9332 one best. Wear cloth mask cover valve. 99% percent filtration you, second cloth layer block valve.

3m 9322 also good, n95 only. 

These masks also last long time. used one polluted conditions (pre covid) 6 months daily basis. ideal, but, expensive. doctor asked considered it, suspect discriminate agewise seeing younger people get it. people know got shingles stressed 30 somethings, new Mom's Dad's wonderful newborn babies are, stressfree not, lol. Anyhow, Mom early 70's, huge impact health figured would good
idea get vaccinated. 

Here Ontario government gives vaccine free people 65-70, want wait long. elective surgeries canceled. dropped picked friend got “elective” heart procedure done peak.  I'm exposure quarantine exposed work boss like ""you probably go store. never take mask."" I'm ""that's works."" time I'm leaving get test tomorrow. share hallways/stairs/elevator 56 units people, possibly expose others it. I'm ok that. REALLY wish balcony sit though. weather nice currently, even able go outside sucks. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ That's good! shaking part parentheses  one listens cdc nowadays. give 'recommendations' none bodies responsible actually enforcing recommendations. calling marriage fail calling kid grow separated parents, puts par brother inviting people wedding.  

## Abstract

A probe patient, seeking help emergency ward French hospital late December 2019 Influenza like symptoms, retrospectively tested positive COVID-19. Despite early appearance virus Europe, prevalence virulence appeared low several weeks, spread severity symptoms increased exponentially, yet marked spatial temporal differences. Here, compare possible linkages peaks fine particulate matter (PM2.5) sudden, explosive increase hospitalizations mortality rates Swiss Canton Ticino, Greater Paris London regions. argue peaks fine particulate matter primarily occurring thermal inversion boundary layer atmosphere. also discuss influence Saharan dust intrusions COVID-19 outbreak observed early 2020 Canary Islands. deem reasonable plausible high PM2.5 concentrations—favored air temperature inversions Saharan dust intrusions—are modulating even boosting severe outbreaks COVID-19. Moreover, desert dust events—besides enhancing PM2.5 concentrations—can vector fungal diseases, thereby exacerbating COVID-19 morbidity mortality. conclude overburdening health services hospitals well high over-mortality observed various regions Europe spring 2020 may linked peaks PM2.5 likely particular weather situations favored spread enhanced virulence virus. future, recommended monitor prevalence virus, also consider occurrence weather situations lead sudden, explosive COVID-19 outbreaks. exactly Christmas shopping done already. I’m privileged could afford that, know everyone can. :( Seems reasonable me. We'll probably continue stay semi-quarantine get enough people vaccinated. mind keeping mask go next year. big deal.  Realistically, spread workers either working second essential job elsewhere others household are. Unless pay healthcare aides support workers wage support whole family, unavoidable. Nope. Network news.  20 second sound bite. I'm glad I'm prepared leave house next 2 months. Really worried family though, sad see holidays That's thought really good question. seen much deals countries have.  mean, Britain EU talked buying millions doses, sounds like trying reassure people. I'm personally thankful. want reassured.

To honest expect vaccine producers give intellectual property rights. I'm concerned 'price gouging' article mentions... crap job explaining meant. Since know long immunity lasts, that's bit worrisome. teach NY feel good paycheck. also amazing job security enjoyable day day experience. stopped getting paid would quit tommorow, guarantee almost teachers will. arent love students. think Tesla cars developed improve environment. think Besos streamlined shipping people could get products faster. think computers internet developed solely betterment society? No, developed individuals wanted money.

You seem eagles fan. realize sports would completely cease exist world view right? playing free food table. want vaccine, nervous it. mRNA vaccine never done anyone know long term side effects? Sounds like 4 year old class. flew Florida couple weeks ago apparently wore masks plane, rest time. 🤯 Guess what? dad Covid. Yes many die many already died. American society privileged powerful country modern times, comes disadvantages. One sense superiority entitlement. I’ve learned traveling different countries life Americans perceived arrogant stubborn. makes sense. We’ve relatively great long time struggle coping difficult changes. Americans evil monsters. angry, stressed, outraged, scared etc challenged ways hard time dealing with. people pushed limits prone behaving thinking irrationally. learning process many us. sure info? believe LEGO makes one. Filipino nurses likely work actue care icu nursing.  He's wealthy God must think he's cool - Evangelicals Nothing life 0 risk. Sitting home watching Netflix probably increases risk heart disease.

That said official estimated CDC numbers COVID-19 survival rates 0-19 year olds 0-19: 99.997%
20-49: 99.98% (IFR .00003 .0002 respectively, simply converted survival instead fatality percentages.Scenario 5 used, best estimate) 

I think lot things college kids higher risk. No. going back that. look trends see lead. Look 1942, now, draw line direction that's heading.

These talked good ole days. Lol. This. It’s partisan. isn’t okay can’t normalize me. You’re either piece shit you’re not. live among real monsters maybe always there, damn, it’s bleak. Masks hill 70 million want us die on. love ANYONE? family worth mask. It’s unbelievable. every one five ambivalent might decide otherwise pushed. give half population loud minority people can't ever change.

Most peoples opinions *do* actually adjust slowly cost shame one looking longer want associated outcast minority opinion. 

Just watch. Trump voters 5 years time admit *ever* Trump voters. 10 years time many hardcore anti climate change people say always believed global warming, cost truly outcast minority upon them. Ask around old folk, see many admit ever protesting civil rights movements.

Change *is* possible them, cost high enough. Yep, vaccinations still required schooling Australia. 
It seems absurd norm everywhere. Sounds like band name Unfortunately likely correct. would say yes, lot places would let use PTO. Depends situation, I'm sure would hate infect someone could avoided 80% posts sub US people vehemently masks freak out. guess feel me! personally would totally okay became normal wear masks public kind illness, even colds, think I’m minority. thinking like strategic marketing exec! temperature semen?

Every beef dairy operation im aware set L2N storage sort. Fired pandemic...? I’m sorry hear that. Dickensian! appreciate doctor doing. I'm sure 'patient's point view' shows accurate. misfortune intubated times. every case, recall talking doctors nurses it. nothing several days later woke up.

My understanding given Versed, causes amnesia, doctor inserted tube, given Etomidate put sleep rocuronium paralyze me. tube in, infusions propofol Fentanyl, kept asleep pain-free. country reported nearly 2,100 covid-19 deaths Tuesday, according data tracked analyzed Washington Post. It’s highest mark since May 6, states reported combined 2,611 virus fatalities. Oh, *new* model. New improved take it? fucking nonsense. Mask usage least 70% city still covid. Yea. matter side you’re bad. one gonna want add another person lockdown, especially look also restrictions hospitals trying put place like limiting such. 

We’re bit screwed here. sad, it’s fortunate technology allow us this. wish didn’t though. needs vaccine going herd immunity old fashioned way? important flatten curve before. healthcare system overwhelmed patients, get care/support need time. This. Masks compulsory area since April cases still rising summer lull. works wife

If first reaction, sad is, probably right. count lucky wife brother like friends. Oh no. That’s truly awful. Lol yeah. like, using car logo? keep hearing hospitals gonna overwhelmed moment now.

Hospitals *have* overwhelmed, realize it. Taking care ICU patient time-consuming, high-attention task. ICU nurse supposed take care one two patients time; three patients, care starts noticably suffer.

In New York City last spring, hospitals one ICU taking care **ten** patients. think patients getting good care? weren't. People died nurse busy taking care someone else coded needed medication adjustment oxygen like mass graves

Oh, mean like ones New York City spring? Like mass graves? I'm sure understand difference two statements quoting below, matter much. letting know might misunderstood one them, misunderstood, others might fear expressing opinion people prefer voice uncommonly held belief public forums people tend attack divide. Mitch McConnell refused bring Pelosi's offers floor, said would DOA. top offered one relief bill (only $500 billion) include stimulus checks takes liability corporations fail provide safe work environment. Maybe know work together, obvious concern Republicans American people. Otherwise would brought two stimulus bills House passed floor. least wear masks everyone jas access vaccine. sense hurting innocents. 

I agree though. Fuck anti vaxxers. They're own. skewed seniors, flu.

In 2017-2018 flu season 185 children died flu US. year 110 child deaths. children died Covid far. wear mask save 121 children Covid19 wear one save 185 children flu? go store cough.

If showing symptoms already late. contagious 24 hours showing flu symptoms. going wear mask every time go store, see friends family go public

Care explain why? put pants go store? around friends wear pants? wear mask? I've always gotten one before, always takes 30 minutes hour sitting lingering pharmacy area, signing papers, checking out, etc. people pass us by. done year yet honest god inside public establishment since March, plan time soon. order groceries, even get take tbh, see people unless outdoors masks distance short period time, etc. 

I worry actual activity getting flu shot putting risk getting covid, dumb feel way? Worked together common good, say? know much sympathy support Nazis America? Perfect. Thanks!  Can’t wait Parler video I'm sure they're misinterpreting physical markers. lot effects sound severe actually quite mild common typical viruses.

A person might get pneumonia, diagnosed pneumonia, get lung scarring feel totally fine after.

The person might get pneumonia, diagnosed covid, get lung scarring, feel awful mind they've ravaged mystery virus. Ultra cold refrigerators -90F existed hundred years? Back March estimating would take 18 months vaccine -- that's next September. Anything bonus. Seems America even getting tired itself. handing something low risk point.  want paranoid (not judging paranoia dealing covid precautions) leave pick items side door. Would demonetized permanently?? measures helped keep COVID-19 control zero chance implemented US. Looks like McKesson hs distribution contract. DoD take easy one. profession quite literally never gets mentioned, around hundreds **unmasked** people time. Indoors close proximity. It’s terrifying depressing knowing forgotten lumped general public. worry little mask protecting us someone group 100+ people infected- also worry infected spreading 100+ next day next week. ....... may may meant quotation marks..... kind business freezers? worked plasma freezers weren’t even cold enough -40C big walk freezers. Nope, like China They'll make ""look"" transparent. science strong public health measures help spread corona virus around world. followed science virus would stay Wuhan thing happen me. Guy approached arm raised Walmart. told feel free, 100 cameras here, I'll gladly take house bank acct sue him. 

That seemed sober left muttering loudly bitches. 

Yep, I'm bitches,mother fucker. ""as high 50% more"" = literally number possible 🤔 see scientific resources anybody some? I'm saying, Mongolian gulags suck beer companies sponsor Lol, says person pushing ozone IV infusions (who even knew thing?) alt-right nonsense great reset. dozen, mean really news? count 12 people without masks Walmarts. Ya better way it. right, I'm sure store cameras would screwed. hope ever run again. 🤦‍♀️ find millions people homeless funny?   July, median delay reporting deaths 7 days. September 20 days. Data: got worse, better, know like right now, really worrying. wear mask, read headlines like I'm sure hell telling random people wear mask wear them.

Those people choosing wear one probably already crazy. wasting time.

However, seen single person without mask that's good. right. People think got right came even wrong day. actually treat wrong first, thats right. insult strangers lol, dont know person. 

Am saying right people pushing hard thats fact. feeling like got right fuck covered mask. surplus bought. six months, Russian vaccine   Uhh technically half world median intelligence. that's median means ;) Anyone think it’s strange shooting Ohio linked “Kentucky.com”? appeal, constantly described Joe rogan subreddit he's moron everyman american know anything, speaks mind guests lets railroad him. said care thousands Americans dying every day intubated alone. strict national diet exercise regimen thousands daily obesity related deaths could prevented too. I'll wear mask long necessary. want hit children, women, geriatrics sticks? shop Costco. Store mandate since March. Idiots don’t like it? Membership revoked. 

The membership model shining right now. fear direction we're veering could outcomes considered collective all. specifics afraid of, anything, unclear current state; thank goodness. agree conspiracies, aware extremes. else find middle ground?

I fear expressing opinion people object. always agree not. hope otherwise realistic. gentleman neither cared add take anything away thread. wanted blurt generalization. care freedoms. contrarians/hyperpartisan assholes opposite everything democrats/media/authority figures ask do. entire personality. willing let Facebook violate right privacy daily basis. care freedom. supposed ignore Fauci virus spreading saying wear masks risk minuscule supposed ignore Fauci pandemic virtually aside ""casedemic"" he's predicting end times? worked Fedex package handler lost like 20 pounds 3 months there. Honestly, really good job, super good benefits, manager cared me. left incompatible school schedule. work hard weeks body gets used it, imo. Yes bc YouTube publisher...... seriously can’t legally that..... Got tested first time today. tested teach one kids class teach end day two hours tested positive contact positive family member. teacher bulk day tested negative here’s hoping well. 

However sneezing lot. hope that’s allergies. hope results Friday Saturday. Hate say sounding like mental. Try really pushing yourself. think virus push run.

You'll amaze yourself.

They're finding lot long hauler cases mental rather physical.  I’m 100%

I’ve realizing since 2016 people don’t want associate with. There's global pandemic ongoing infectious airborne virus. Let's hold motorcycle rally anyway. mean could possibly go wrong, eh? Comment battle round 9865792, start

Time take popcorns Lol
 
Ok. renters do? Really? There's Toyota Plant outside window right now. censorship. gov didnt tell youtube isnt public space. Anyone create another youtube, oann options post videos. Glad hear it. Looking details ""Lie, obfuscate, deny""

You think ever country (i fair idea) things? Same. skeptical even mean - assume critical negativity - - assume least discover most.

Ironically, think MRNA interesting significant enough mass-deployment basically new tech yet ""skepticism"" ""research"" concluded choosing vaccines etc so, offered Pfizer 48 hours, yeah I'd crash course talking friends medicine reading but, tbh, likely I'd end taking it. Oh well. suspect (or least would suprised if) there's very, very, big astroturf campaign happening right around vax promotion ""Great Reset"" etc.  People vote Republican Democrat claiming capitalist oppressor save them. they'll shocked oppressor gives free money rich blames side. Long covid debunked quite thoroughly. Find new slant. Guess lobby drunk driving speeding regulations too, yer freedumbs? Like said...Ohio basically Indiana 😜 outside Cleveland Columbus, rest state pretty shit. That’s great point! would love experience side effects. I’m jealous haha. Yes. Please do. Pre-tax income. bother apologizing. wildly sarcastic. Sorry clear point. 

You know fuck going grand scheme things. Midwest shot foot. want Midwest get shots family lives moved Midwest, also little thankful aren’t rewarding states managed poorly. US plenty states would near top list though. Compare US EU European countries states apples apples comparison guess many countries 20+% pop infected corona isnt slowing means. wear mask spend 10,000 years purgatory,

Seems right. Sometimes covid sucks. couldn’t get tests spring direct numerical comparison doesn’t work. Scientists estimated better treatment reduced mortality 30% definitely good news though tempt fate, would difficult much worse now, especially vulnerable population vaccinated. yoy would rather put everyone meet risk catching deadly virus? anti mask people ever feel remorse deaths post shows exactly ignorant vaccines ones particular. 

Do always believe headlines? Apparently do. Giesecke (who hired consultant help w strategy)

I thought hired help modeling?

Not good start little list ""proof"" there. Eesh. Sorry. thoughts prayers mean nothing Covid. Masks helps though. reality matters none right wrong what... it’s self education staying safe. That’s all.

Yet keep lying herd immunity strategy, quite literally celebrating right people dying one sentence saying that.

Psychopath. Worked [Contagion I've told staff even direct people onto circles floor. Everyone lost fucking minds feel like staff deal crazy people. ""Because loves Trump he's one us! might Q along!""  perhaps immune system high? Personally usually feel side effects of.. anything. weird, kinda wanna experience like everyone else noooooo sure itll hit 35k much bad news comming. 
Stocks effectively bullet proof reason days. first appeal denied different caseworker initial denial. two took place different states. first worker present hearing. news FDA stating plan approving it? I've heard great deal sources saying may available early mid-december, nothing FDA saying plan green-light vaccine hearing. many years, that's case countries tropics. Travelers need present yellow fever vaccination passport. enforced airlines rather border agents immigration desk. totally understand predicament really understand getting downvoted. Individual safety conflict public health. also anyone individually try reason anti maskers ""be hero"". Thanks trying protect employees, least care them. shame things totally insane can't even ask wear mask without worrying safety. death rate? Yes no. able afford rent bedrooms, lost everything December 2018 house fire followed immediately house burgling. Living group home working figuring want here. read headline way you: Sweden showing signs herd immunity.  Pope lecturing people putting something skin protect disease? 

Funny. Guess CA get bulk. Yes that's exactly feel fucking chaps ass get order, ridiculous substitutions, immediately go inside find shelf.

Except 3 Walmart stores range, closest one literally half-stocked, across whole store. worked inventory control specialist team lead Walmart different city one summer... inventory system seriously fucked. Probably function bad management.

Which getting weird subs. forced order bad store mentioned turn substitutions worth hassle. video released early pandemic Italian hospitals stark showed lot consequences able get care. Absolutely know mean. Everyone n resident sick one came back positive. we're re-tested yesterday negative. Nobody knows whether COVID. Definitely respiratory virus sort. many people unironically believe exactly that. sad. I'm wondering died particular strain it. I've heard new Spanish strain might worse original. Hip hip hooray. :) #zerotolerance Developing mRNA literally company founded. stated Wikipedia 2010, ModeRNA Therapeutics formed commercialize research stem cell biologist Derrick Rossi. Rossi developed method modifying mRNA first transfecting human cells, dedifferentiating stem cells could redifferentiated desired target cell types. matter officials elect. long they're elected, they're incompetent. linear reduction cases disease spreads exponentially? makes sense. environmental conditions (indoor meetings, cold surfaces) drive infections right now, mobility data show people follow guidelines well expected? well circumstances unnatural inexplicably wins defamation suit court despite ruining lives. mean, sure worse would restrictive measures place. bad compare numbers european countries, like Belgium, Spain, Italy, France.

I think herd immunity strategy clearly failed, get lot hate preventing deaths citizens far better first world countries. 'Hamsteren' Dutch guess also German term hoarding panic-buying. Nah mostly shared value human life. I’m health care. don’t even come close 75K year. stimulus literally went childcare didn’t even cover head virtual learning yet again..  Oh btw, daycare area help virtual learning can’t help kids. kids falling behind can’t teacher plus work full time plus make sure mouths fed. yes person holding tablet, standing screen loved one see person.  fucking sucks.  okay. 

Be fucking thankful make 75k.  There’s plenty us don’t luxury.  agree. we're let's stop people breathing that's true culprit right there: breathing. wrote..truth. makes think. According medical personnel, reason injections make feel sick body creating immune response. vaccines supposed provide least 90% protection. someone doesn’t feel sick injection, mean they’re part 10% that’s protected?

Interesting. Everyone else went quarantine arrogant Swedes decided. No. go herd immunity. Definitely using belligerently anti-woke describe certain people one misunderstandings antibodies. Antibodies give body tools fight known infection, still get infection body gets head start fighting off. guarantee every time inhale virus, body always fight off

If viral load high, immunocompromised, immune system low fighting another illness, even unlucky, infection spread faster body fight off. Anytime try roll back provisions assume they're stupid again. wrong. Herd immunity works natural vaccine initiated. problem actually want natural herd immunity. That's bad news, much worse Europe, 13 European countries much worse death totals US per capita basis yesterday, morning even worse Belgium Poland 5,000 US equivalent deaths Tbf, either Americans Indians. People forget many Indians Reddit. favor search India worldnews. negative news India usually 75% upvotes. Go /r/geopolitics look anything negative China, majority comes India. Ford workforce? Essential, possibly. Frontline? No. 

The number delivery vehicles use significantly higher year ago. also spike demand consumer vehicles fear public transit migration urban cores. automobile industry bit essential. 

I would guess reason hospital system's plan vaccinating employees news kind thing expected do. Ford on-site flu vaccinations, too, that's rarely considered crisis require new equipment. companies getting vaccine healthcare workers, would problem, that's they're talking about. Yes actually no. available civilians yet. SARS-COV-1 less 10,000 cases total, spread across multiple countries, would make awfully hard pick correlate long term effects unless common. even effects, might notice them. COVID millions millions cases, effects going become much obvious track, yet even 5% cases long term effects, still huge societal economic impact. (Nevermind large proportion SARS-CoV-1 infected show signficantly worse health outcomes years track, especially health care workers, significant percentage still returned work several years outbreak). people killed conventional [fire bombing attack Tokyo night 9-10 March think misunderstood. ""at least 6 months"" that's data available right now. can't claim longer data. ye kinda annoying elementary math, doesnt take time vaccineate people. happens night. first -almost normal- summer. became spring user estimates... dude thread postet new year might close year prior- ye trillion upvotes... cant walk shops without pain lungs breath. 
Unless respiratory specialist, like seeing moment, funny enough, told said... 

Pushing put early grave, make better. 13 European countries recorded higher death tolls US per capita basis yesterday, much higher: Belgium, Poland,Romania,Austria,Hungary,Croatia,UK,Czech Republic,Switzerland,Greece,France,Spain, Italy Knowing people died even losing loved ones changed lot people's minds doubt seeing images suffering flash across television screen would much. 

At point pandemic everyone pretty much chosen side. ones refuse take seriously going change. Ask r/COVID19
They’ll give answer you’re looking since that’s science based sub point vaccine start distributed top that. vast majority cases Europe USA contracted locally, international borders irrelevant.

I'm sure reflect sentence see make requirement controlling spread virus reducing infection rate 1.0.

It's currently 1.0 across countries Western Europe. Happy thanksgiving everyone Oh lord...I’m Ohio, amount vitriol Governor’s twitter scary. People openly bragging many people coming Thanksgiving, etc. ""They"" (people much smarter me) appear believe mRNA's success could lead positive movements field Cancer research. Good know there's least black list system place China. Though, Australian articles linked complaining, maybe China explains clarifies testing methodology exporters, understanding testing results enact better quality control ends. Takeouts safe everyone preparing food follows health guidelines. Sadly pig head America nobody follows health guidelines. us already knew months one vaccine candidate two shots. been? Well, might result ""the goverment blocking facts!!!"" It’s weird think many people don’t realize bad it’s getting. covid fatigue real. hear covid figure “I haven’t caught time nothjng worry about”. 5,000 day US equivalent numbers already Belgium Poland morning per capita basis people lambast reputable news sources ""the lamestream media,"" call university education ""liberal indoctrination,"" ridicule ivy league graduates ""coastal elites.""

Anti-intellectualism alive flourishing. Okay keep wearing mask distancing rest life cause vaccinated people allowed return normal, you’ll stuck inside day. fun! Interesting. least falls cases due less testing. course lot due lockdown saying R rate 0.65 Belgium Poland already disastrous level, Belgium reported morning 183 deaths, that's 5,124 deaths US---Poland reported 674 deaths, that's 5,864 US deaths  Interesting. read article, specifically figure hamsters anything. guess that's German term panic buying. People got rona need vaccine anyway. New hospitalizations increasing 1,000 day earlier November. now? vaccines don’t work difference sheer amount people contracted covid opposed viruses mention. result much higher absolute number people chronic issues consequence. benefit perhaps push really study understand conditions like CFS/ME finally offer patients relief. Stab em around 100k cases every day, compare last spring death rate cut half, guess people still want look half empty glass scenario.  welcome. I’ll try translate add sources time. UK pass Sweden, ahead Sweden early on. hardly surprising USA overtook seeing dysfunctional political leadership been.  young people know people gotten see peers fine take seriously mean there’s wiki/FAQ sub I've using Ford Rawsonville made masks since April, they're far comfortable breathable I've used. crazy paparazzi photographers kill get photo Justin Bieber naked. even though photos would definitely demand, dont seem care getting Covid footage!  None 10-15 lb turkeys left store. made feel better spread facing week. got 20 lb bird pregnant, starving, happen really love Thanksgiving turkey. something significant dates, people's desire live lives normal possible, albeit caution. distant family isolates days prior travel, gets tested uses good hygiene, risk low. risk 0, neither driving see family either. chance could die car crash. Yikes. Something really wrong health care priced like airline tickets. Stupid stupid does. Herd immunity on/off switch. Proponents swedish strategy predicting countries would catch Sweden eventually Sweden would better position come second wave. supposed number recovered immune people. That's herd immunity, too. Holy fuck can’t tel can’t read you’re autistic 15 cases going turn 0. Covid-19 disappear Easter like miracle.


Looks like short bus states still little slow learn mistakes made 9 months ago beginning this. Apparently many still trying catch up.


Our whole country could nipped crap bud months ago common sense snowflakes believing GED better PHD MD decided evil world wide plot big brain dear leader. You’re getting downvoted bc it’s ridiculous unrealistic idea reluctant talk politics considering tense relation Australia China now, think easy way solve this. polluted frozen food trigger deeper reason far food itself, sides. takes test Yeah, logic eludes me. *We’re* “total” war *them*, therefore they’re cowards attacking us years loud saber rattling end decided make top priority. Huh? 

Also, bit war on, since it’s *over there*, don’t call attention military’s involvement it. wait there’s political advantage gained discussing it. 

But they’re cowards. Hm. dry yes ;) thing know that, people returned home Covid symptoms already early Februar, reports people infected depending week Februar.

Also Scandinavians typically skiing places Scandinavians, rarely go places local Italians etc.

What know infamous bar Austria many Scandinavians visitors infected bartenders/personnel early Februar. Sars-2 Italy already summer 2019.

So obsession week winter holiday sounds like bad excuse, unless actually see reports it. think likely, Sweden maybe people returning home early spring Somalia, Iran Pakistan rest Nordics.

Denmark also widespread infection communities, know assumption correct, Finland Norway less people returning home infected countries. “No.” - Mitch McConnell used quotes ""proof"" strategy connected to.  Nose nice way Telegraph wearer stupid. Facts Sweden hit harder Denmark. believe list United States ranked 18th lol That’s function. Total dickhead thing say. Probably around 95% everyone job, maybe several.

You’re special work. You’re quite average, actually understand, used curing process. Instead hanging deep freeze use vacuum pump suck air water.

Instead weeks hang drying, ready sale 24-48 hours. Well actually bothered single words seem remember said support help.

At least agree say strategy. Well invade country kill million people. yeah guess done sake optics, kid 75yrs later wouldn’t feel icky clear however herd immunity never achieved humans via natural infections alone. really point ""what epidemic take year naturally"" ""accelerate herd immunity"" part - ever happen without vaccine. ""a guy called Tom Britton"" lol.

You know well FHM based many predictions work mathematician. refers consistency blood 25%-30% AMErican disLiKE tUBE ThroAt physician real contraindications non-live vaccines virtually non-issue. exception extremely rare side effect say Guillain-Barre anaphylactic reaction previous coronavirus vaccine (which nil since first one kind) real contraindications ""for medical purposes"".  It’s stupid selfish people like can’t follow easy rules. restaurants haircuts. 

The government paying us stay home. understand work makes hard people socially distance. also feel unemployed small business owners greatly. you’re dumbass going party masks, you’re asshole. Sorry. Vaccines going available general public late Feb/March. physician know medical professionals still saying blown proportion? work 5 hospital system healthcare analytics area. met non medical staff don’t believe (still). keep hearing supposed er nurses docs told someone made up. Usually hear arguing idiots internet. Totally, they've become entrenched position even listen another opinion, aided echo chamber social media.

Compromise become dirty word, people wear masks, socially distance, comply track trace laws get vaccinated one becomes available restrictions eased removed. 

The polarisation people seems big societal illness age. new playstations. randomly dematerialize arrive. death rate polio low, way killed horrifying, robbing children strength, think made notable. dramatic effectiveness vaccination. polio paralysed lot people survived, lot long term effects 20-40 percent also getting post polio syndrome (the incidence well studied). simple looking death rates, think mistake people make COVID too. Who’s joking word, “humour”? :)  2,100 + 877 = 911 Sounds like serious stern warnings unleashed!  Yeah, solid point. I’m nurse working two jobs one facilities offered contract work top current status. Realistically, I’m working is. Healthcare workers lives families childcare strain pandemic. Uh huh... nuance.  Please tell referring to. see made stupid statement, got called it, trying change goal posts. Please tell nuance explains 10x difference death rates Sweden, shut down, two nordic neighbors, did. Ah, right. Anyway meant support point. Physican here: absolutely loving this. Either guys talking past strong sense dry absurdist humour! WOO PARTY (cough cough) Michigan like Petri dish growing organisms idea Petri dish is. I'm surprised coming Dakotas. seems men see wearing mask sign virility something. Whatever.

The thing concerns article 2 large healthcare organizations merging. Costs rise.Whatever happened anti-monopoly laws? dishonest again. say “help modelling” says “help **the unit work** modelling **and analysis**”. True, meant herd immunity way vaccination. infected people take serious toll medical care many years come. people dying bad enough people (over 80k) clogging hospitals, also everyone's health care going complete sh*t (for much population bad covid) many people needing care suddenly long term types issues covid causes. We're seeing probably closest RL version Scrooge ever will. many Tiny Tims though :( I'll take chances, considering I'm likely hit lightning. Indeed Even 2 nukes, military tried stage coup kidnap emperor prevent surrendering.

You must one hell car salesman article presents criticism methodology one study, recommends taking supplements.  Finding fault one study, disprove thesis.

The article makes *one* mention studies: ""Numerous studies far concluded administering vitamin significant influence severity COVID-19 infection.""  *The link sentence goes another article, state conclusion indicated sentence.*   fact, linked article states opposite -- ""physiological immunological roles vitamin ... warrant mechanistic investigation."" Yes that’s correct word.

That word must different meaning Polish. thought saw word hypothetical transfer matter energy one point another without traversing physical space them. common subject science fiction literature, film, video games, television.

Apparently long respiratory disease spread person person, low population density matter people refuse socially distance wear masks. concern exists independently that. pretend “support unit (for analysis) work modelling analysis” something entirely different “help strategy”. 

Yes. need pretend. Support modelling help modelling. stated ""even pandemic"", means pandemic. question still stands. hoping title clickbait not. ridiculous thing do. air travel locked numbers go significantly. Apologies. authorative angry style fooled me.  


If able follow Swedish media yourself, rely friends randomly told you, would suitable humble.  


As haven‘t heard friends, best guess typical Swedish style avoid unpleasant truths controversy. No, one option, unconditional surrender. official US policy, Japan nation obviously lost war needed accept. US problem Japanese government gave shit emperor remained power hundreds thousands citizens. 

Japan got nuked twice, Japanese Government still debated whether surrender afterwards. 100,000 Japanese soldiers became casualties Manchuria fighting USSR following 7 days Nagasaki got nuked. Even Military still attempted coup keep war going. Tokyo got firebombed oblivion earlier year.

It US's problem Japanese government incapable accepting reality, US responsibility protect Japanese citizens governments stupid decisions. liken fence argument. One argues fence remain is. argues fence removed. Meanwhile problem fence addressing already broken thru fence hundred miles away. Love subscriber exclusive links! buddy medical field said covid like covid death rate low. Mention polio lot people think serious. lot people discount covid. 3,000 americans died polio 1952, couple years vaccine came out. ""Why need learn exponents? I'll never use real world."" Right? assumed would 30% expected adhere guidelines way around yes, polish scientists found teleportation harmful children. especially long distance teleportation already restricted adults. great success using teleportation covid easier reach others instant it’s getting controversial children. 2018 flu wasn’t business normal though. Flu every year stresses hospitals years really test system. Hospital’s usually run 80-9o% capacity average otherwise becomes financially difficult maintain resources. Paying salaries staff don’t patients care example can’t sustained long term. Capacity lower summer, higher flu, drops holidays electives aren’t scheduled, etc. 20% influx patients huge number. could still another 1,000,000 infections November. December could even worse. Honestly seems like vaccine might thing end current surge, rather restrictions natural ebb flow. What, wanting spend time make every morning mental illness? 

I mentally ill nothing wanting wear mask. 😂 assume continue funded. Governments short term memory. Im guessing get 3 years funding tops post covid it? seems like links guy called Tom Britton. part Swedish strategy group?

Assault felony (or crime depending state) part US even never make contact. that's happens!?! knew something always updates appear Woah, that’s lot. wonder average number people hospitalized given time things like heart disease cancer are. mean, people can't manage mask respiratory issues.

Face shield? Easier much better stopping virus spread air Except creep towards 5+% depending patient volume overloading hospitals. Seriously. Political differences would disappear invading force came American shores. tasks everyone sub continues push “Sweden failure” narrative. 

1. Look current world standing COVID deaths per capita. 

2. Look cause mortality figures comparison recent years. 

3. Look latest data deaths per day. 

4. Meditate deeply. Seasonal mean stops summer.

Fair enough. also clear much unlike cold virtually disappears also abundantly clear seasonal stopped ravaging Sweden heated without much social distancing.

There nothing clear conclusion. particular, stop ravaging California? wearing masks stricter lockdown...

Herd immunity (Sweden reached far higher infection rate California) by-far easier explanation seasonality..

Fun fact: South CA started ALSO started declining Aug, TX, AZ FL, apparently new measures decline clearly seasonal. infection rates however reached/surpassed Sweden's thus adding support herd-immunity-only-requires-20% infection ratestheories...

Of course, water bridge right now... german name seems nice funny... course bad. course it’s Kentucky. state collectively stupid enough keep re-electing Mitch fucking McConnell. think make temporary ICU glass walls Whitehouse South Lawn.

Mortality low Sweden looks like things went according plan. Compare current Daily Portugal deaths current Daily Swedish deaths 85 7. population countries. long run Sweden fewer total covid deaths...unless Portugal receives vaccine next 2 months. 

If OP intended gloat poor form misleading data. argument that, true, would apply publishers well. bullshit claim I've arguing whole time.


I’ve already explained difference publisher platform. You’ve claimed understand that. Clearly not. also clearly value open discourse. publisher says ""I publish hateful Nazi drivel."" harming discourse.


It could argued is. Allowing distasteful topics discussed allows one better ability properly argue bad ideas. Clearly partaken activity. keep saying things “should” certain way aren’t. keep going circles without paying attention I’ve trying explain you. I'm saying Youtube ought disallow using service.

And wrong saying turns youtube publisher, platform, making liable content platform, subject laws weren’t before. clearly understanding law applies them, OR, don’t care, case arguing bad faith. whole line reasoning long string mental hoops jump order justify propaganda.

It’s reasoning. It’s law, long string mental hoops. read it.  country, annual flu vaccines various preventative wellbeing initiatives commonly provided workers employer, despite also universal healthcare. Healthy workforce saves company money regardless insurance system. Didn’t ya hear? Masks still needed vaccine Ohio 7th populous state Illinois 6th. Michigan 10th midwest getting screwed. Sure.... said... think 3 peer reviewed studies say lockdowns lower mortality rate.  Chinese. Thank comment. media, capitalist behind/control media, can't accept success story government controled capitalists. media convince government's success fake. fake, success evil. 
Capitalists afraid losing legitimacy ruling class. ""The planet alive honey. either rate."" Millions Americans looked past letter name. They're calling anyone follow Trump line RINOs calling purge Republican party.

The Republican Party intents purposes become Trump Party. lot people react badly someone tries tell do. strategy show, tell. wear big scary P100 respirator. walk by, people see me, double take, pull mask without saying word. great resource track national hospitalizations anyone hasn’t seen data shows incredibly alarming. basically research lumps bunch things, including locked down, together one variable A, “stringent index,” like scientists agree computed, claims variable correlated another lumped variable B, computed bunch variables (using PCA), claims B correlated death rate C lumped period time. mention PCA works well bunch variables multivariate Gaussians, likely true case.

Further research needed. tell? they’d 90,000 dead streets would covered bodies? [The Imperial estimate around recently high income countries. [The World Health notes serology studies converge IFR’s 0.5% 1%.

Most interesting finding Imperial College, opinion, risk fatality doubles every 8-year age increase. wonder catholic republicans react this. Apparently understand process science. Let explain you.

It takes time.

Dumb dumb. put Oceania Asia.

It Good call refrigerants, though think China (globally highest unregistered emissions there).

Shipping companies might decent bet, though honestly I'm fan UPS insane import fees. Domestically average. What’s stupid POINTING that’s terrible strategy? 

I don’t convince I’m right. numbers numbers. Lol people want open approach huge margin.

Anything else would illegal well nobody expecting more. Stand everyone.  Kentucky warning shot.... (it knee) dying wonderful. order Instancart Costco every couple weeks, expensive store, I'm seven months pregnant absolutely worth it. province China, never been. nation fight virus own, fared exceptionally well, without even need lockdown. trust numbers regarding actual Chinese provinces anyway.

That's based current numbers cases around 200,000 per day usual 3 week time lag. 

Those people already dead know it... so? highlights problem better. insane website I’ve ever seen posted r/coronavirus. It’s like infowars. share information WHO. sat it.

Making American Graves circle. really sure works like appreciate optimism Exactly Hey... bright side.... Netflix pretty decent app now. take movies work.

the king). assume figuring things take time. Yeah, that's smart you.

And no, owe US anything. precious president shutdown pandemic prevention system. smart.

The Americans whole, smart. Based comments thread, appears Canada went China first. tomorrow seem brighter.

For value tomorrow 1 gotten bad think herd immunity actually starting turn infection around. Seeing 10% state tested positive COVID, means likely around half people gotten infected thus far, I'd expect herd immunity kick shoes, shirt, mask f*ck service. It’s simple Read sci-fi I'm small-minded, haha. Thanks buddy! Incorrect, disagree banning misinformation outright lies, fascist. US 25% total infections month November. employee probably get fired least there, shooting customers good business believe amount deaths reported country accurate. fact, I’ll link data. 

The number falling, even fine print saying 60% death certificates processed within 10 days. said current bar November 7th, 17 days ago. 

Do believe 20% number real? Yeah, same. Mask usage Bay Area go (to pick food get groceries) 100% one complaining it. assume comments like must OC parts CA. Intelligent people get cults

...they though. Maybe often stupid people, happens.

I think emotional problem, rather intelligence problem. poland nutshell... sad. Oh interesting US, also ""out control"" we're seeing ton children end ER?
Hmmm sounds like BS 🤷🏾‍♂️ Wow BULLSHIT. I'd end brawling teacher. I've professional development sessions union official hosting referred paras ""The red-headed stepchildren,"" DOE. Would another teacher?? believe classed Al Qaeda attack. Plenty links like training official members planned OBL. agree you. spike continued opening + Halloween, imagine Thanksgiving wave 2-3 weeks. going catastrophic. Well, know nurse got symptoms home, called hospital works wanting self-isolate test done told come work someone to. Sure enough test turned positive day after. fine. hospital director face consequences. Governor horrible. so? Oh understand I've already reached Dr see get line. asthma I'm hoping get earlier list. I'd take today could. Exactly! It’s scary, isn’t serious absolutely is, can’t imagine something much ... sinister, like filovirus something... came italy chicago summer. kids lung scaring, heart inflammation, organ damage etc. **visible** symptoms. Ahh, meinspace think real-world problem.

The vaccine scarce many months. that, year data available.

The harder problem want additional safety data, outright want get it. many people like left without antibodies next summer, others vaccinated? bit ""luck"", talking 20% left something like that. ages people dying. 80-100 year olds. 55 year old nowhere near ""disposable age"". need protected. Yes, 106 people died, he’s writing proportion population US died died Hungary - 106 people total Hungarian population equivalent 3636 people total US population I'm going get available hate title post. Sounds pushy like someone trying get try drugs foreign country maintain required number people vaccinated times locations prevent resurgence diseases they've defeated. Also personal protection within herd. never said vaccines protect you. protect enough people got too. thought bone leg? let spread.

This strategy. distancing safe vaccination rollout.

This strategy. 

People usually mistake lack legally mandated lockdowns sign so-called “herd immunity strategy”. However probably quirk Swedish constitution Swedish way things: *individual responsibility* opposed authority figures barking orders. focusing means makes miss intent, was: Slow spread much possible (with available means) wait vaccines, learn live disease vaccines fail arrive. everyone else, slightly different approach. 

This hammered us (Swedes) since clear pandemic arrived community spread March, continues be. work heart surgery icu. I've speculating see average age heart failure drop increase number LVAD's BiVAD's future *think* positive tests gets counted new cases, too. Right?

That seems problematic. yep. fever, cough, runny nose... maybe headache that’s visible. it’s reported since early summer italy/chicago etc. kids even zero visible symptoms lung scaring, heart inflammation etc. 6 months discovering HIV, thought another flu like disease realize effective death sentence.

We truly underestimate viruses actually without necessary time study experiment it. actual numbers 

Poland's 7 day moving average = 495 deaths/day (and rapidly going up)

US 7 day moving average = 1657 deaths/day 

Poland's deaths poland size pop US would 4272 deaths/day 

So currently Poland's death rate 2.6X US. countries seeing death rates go end sight. Obama get health care Trump get great economy. Considering people get “really fucking sick” flu, covid severe flu, really hard imagine? hated guy guild Another tragedy thousands deaths could avoided intentional White House campaign hide information virus fatality let infect ""democratic"" cities, probably face consequences. There's many reasons. reddit whole give one fuck market use score points dunking capitalism. 

First foremost, companies represented stock market representative ""Main Street"" USA. generally large multinational corporations. benefited immensely pandemic. smaller stores got shut down, places like walmart home depot target left open due nebulous designation essential. helped retail side market.

Another good portion tech. Tech done well covid well. Everybody staying home browing FB, Snap, Netflix, DIS + etc. Even hardware manufactures well. Many people, contrary reddit thinks, actually disposable income throughout summer. Including stimulus check extra 600 week unemployment also able spend money restaurants bars. bought motorcycle June salesman saying he's best year decade. half way year. keep bikes quads floor. 

And top off, really else put money. Bond returns shit. People wary real estate, despite housing market going fucking balistic(at least around me). Precious metals iffy. Always IMO.  costs real many people suffer consequences lockdowns restrictions. think worth it, think less severe, desperate willing take risks shot normal life. reasonable guess still real problem, hard determine right policy likely different poor country rich one. Proving neurological issue result virus going extremely difficult diagnosed process elimination symptoms. true effect known many decades. Americans can't asked something sake people themselves. Many people see disease kills old sick people, I'm old sick, worry this. Pay Bill’s what? leftists LGBT! stats show Poland late relatively mild first wave spring. fairly recent development. Yet are, still us. Depends looking. eg. every 1% increase unemployment typically = 40,000 deaths year. economy notoriously difficult fix, individual level, sliding slope personal debt extremely difficult climb back out. hear what's happened Beirut's currency past year? (for various reasons, COVID explosion part it). 

And unfortunately many cases, people feel better dead live like this. (subjectively vs objectively, put it). Though even case, objectively? depression, feeling like every day want die, joy, happiness, crippling depression, actually better dead? nutshell that’s what’s going on. years actually. pollution. it’s reported pollution kills 40k minors year. nothing done, problem ignored, wood coal cheap. Oh agree, it’s like numbers letters concern me. We’re best, there’s much dueling conference calls. lack regulation sake economy incredibly short sighted. lasting effects going cost us fortune. Sorry? hoping Australians die, prove Sweden choose stupidly dangerous ""strategy""? pain holidays define ""them"". Poland divided US. current president 51,03% 48,97% votes - almost 50:50. multimillion EUR (2 billion PLN / year TVP, mention right wing outlets largely supported public money - advertisements bought state-owned companies) propaganda machine side.

with thats going poland wouldnt surprised civil war soon. yes there's lot ppl suppporting ruling party much hate Lololol makes worse power wealth hasn’t helped US, shows bad misinformation, brainwashing anti-science spread trump’s base government. Meanwhile, people reddit toddlers 9/11 hate Patriot Act can't understand passed. Hilarious, social science level. ""LIBERATE"" tweets love him

Well, 1% (it 51/49) July, believe me, elections held today, sure would lose. sad summer, well... living bubble really know anyone voted him. again, live big city. I'm sick people claiming still got virus despite efforts. find went gym regularly people mask up. 

Come back wfh, curbside pickup, isolate. That's maximum. Otherwise, not. sucks people work self isolate family case go parties! think means aren’t showing “traditional” symptoms dramatic issues arise.  That’s gets lunatic people. You’re high horse morality making sacrifices ‘protect others, even one life lost tragedy’ 

Except it’s person disagree with, hope fucking die.

I’m sure you’re young kid, explains it, makes even depressed world going endure future. long going wait? tested several months tens thousands people? long need stay house? people concerned Covid-19 vaccine without necessarily vaccines. based recent surveys, doubt 50% population anti vaccines. **asymptomatiC symptoms. WTF??** get vaccinated foreign illnesses travel countries? ""The buck stops here"" Trump leader, gets take full responsibility underlings doing. Show COVID touched look it.

The number people I've seen saying ""lOcKdOwNs wOrK"", completely unaware countries *did* work, damn high. doctors nurses went strike, many people would die? transmission occurring extended contact small gatherings. masked passing contact stores. COVID almost become way life Americans now. unbelievable.

Here East Asia almost like COVID never happened.

We basically followed guidelines (mask, contact tracing, quarantine, etc) soon hit us. hand US shat , defunded basically ignored situation today waiting big pharma solve problem. 

At rate become like state sanctioned culling weak especially realize stock markets going up. correct, polish titles good way. they’re book titles. 

“Things happening” People aren’t changing minds point unfortunately thats said. think anyone able buy sell whatever want yes, short medical services. one forcing anyone buy it. problem stop trying kill people. Stay fuck home selfish jerk. problem. horrible person. feel like shit. fact need discuss forcing people stay home thanksgiving problem people like damn selfish. Look mirror wana see evil.

Alot universities NC ended semester today, students sent home January. new cases 24%.

Slowing verb. Herd immunity slowing.

Sorry, engaged rewriting history.

For months told ""herd immunity"" ""on/off switch"" effects herd immunity seen long usually cited thresholds reached.

For instead seems brainstorming ways explain public need full herd immunity – requires 60 percent 70 percent population infected vaccinated – partial immunity effect rate spread.   case immunity rises population, rate spread disease decreases**,"" Tegnell wrote email to Giesecke March 19th.

YOU WANT HAPPEN, DIRTY COMMUNIST? sure aiming at.

Doctors get money it, hospitals do. sure know Polish healthcare works, basically get money per patient depending type illness (because e.g. cancer patients need care, equipment - bring ""money"" government).

So report ""cheaper"" cause death ""more costly"" benefits hospital (they money buy equipment, pay bills etc.). quite good excuse report covid cases.

I one case family doctor asked ""Can mark covid death?"".


But point comment deny covid (I'm quite opposite), point covid even deadly reported government - 1000 deaths daily right (we resort looking GUS data, official government one started lying them, e.g. reporting detected cases) - can't cheat death.

BTW. Reporting death also easy thing Poland, can't move body doctor arrives reports death. family wait 12 hours doctor arrive (and summer much much fewer cases). mom bought 16 pound turkey that’s always gets.

1. government could realise WFH bad economy now. (ie, less people buying lunch, coffee, using public transport, less companies paying office space, etc) could start offering incentives make companies employees go back work person
2. companies could think ""okay, so, everything set working home smoothly... Would really matter next hire from... overseas?"" National mask mandate.

My real issue ""click bait"" title; technically true, misleading. Basically, story interesting me. Without title wasted time reading it. subject, course:

She must spent years (and would spent many more, survived) correcting people spelling name. kid?  suggest waste time Impachment nothing legal/illegal. That's defence used people want raise bar impeachment (usually convenience). Impeachment political decision impeaching body, either legislature coters case recall. ridiculous. course need whipped cream. Ma'am? Bodily autonomy. Thank you! Truly. reading *every* piece feedback making notes updates. think people able smoke store? Sars less 10000 confirmed cases pulling illegal weapon within guidelines normal pro wrestling match sub read tons testimonies similar mine, medias time creating things like that.

I hate break you...but Reddit count ""real life"". I'm surprised experience Covid involves Reddit, much else. Anyone write anything...doesn't mean true. 

In real life, big deal all. That's fact. 

Stop told think believe. can't say cases ""spiking"" every single day, whether actually going up, going down, stable (right appear relatively stable). People completely ignore every day cases ""spiking"" ""through roof"" on. real though. wouldn’t fight war state state basis. unified war that’s COVID become. need unity. state state bullshit prolonging impacts. visualizations like too. live Canada beginning would cross cities (mostly I’ve visited) COVID deaths hit total population. Next city go Montreal 1.6 million it’s coming fast. 

It helps put numbers perspective. fact majority ones know want nasty chemicals body nothing autism yep, walked around floor saw wearing mask would think unsafe. public environment need show others safe wearing mask. information immune isnt. agree there's subconscious stigma comes wearing masks?

The thoughts see person wearing mask indoor public place, immediately think they're intelligence low (obviously right) anyone wearing mask blatant idiot. effective wearing ""science denier"" sign. 

The second thing think they're idiots they're dangerous self centered, selfish possibly narcissistic. 

Then turn around walk way avoid much possible people life love would destroy responsible bringing home virus could hurt kill them. they're dehumanizing

To humanize means ""to make (something) humane civilized."" Humane means ""having showing compassion benevolence."" 

Civilized means ""polite well-mannered, advanced stage social cultural development."" Benevolence means ""the quality well meaning; kindness.""

There nothing humanizing, polite well mannered, showing compassion kindness others wearing mask prevent spreading illness. never gonna convince anything else say.

You failed describe social situation talking mask stops chatting someone up. Given minks Poland infected think bet Covid hanging around while.  


It came animals jumped humans... back animals back humans.  


Mink variant didnt mutate much.  


We quite species animals ( rodent family alone giant ) ... want bet one finally gets mutation much deadly ? People judging mayor telling people avoid travelling spread Covid 19 isnt following advice visiting family Thanksgiving. isnt leading example. let get straight, time anyone questions anything mainstream media governors say automatically labeled “dumb conspiracy theorist”? Yep. Don’t think specific character FF, style boss. 

Remember walking boss fight getting butt handed me. mom died September. travel see one last time of, know, pandemic. one needs fucking travel. pandemic.  Yeah strange inaccurate tic news media bugs me. hard write ""Wisconsin reported 5,469 new cases 63 deaths today."" case, Wisconsin appears crested wave. Let's see far curve goes give turns around again. realize would cause scandal? Impeachment bit much, censure absolutely. lose office, official mark record face public regarding it. would engage cardinal sin told everyone else do? keep using word. think means think means. honest, every single thanksgiving wish could fuck ski four days instead, finally can, feel bad it. would submitting waiver to? think mention B cells well, since immune memory arguably important part vaccines immunity work. may complicate things feel like people see immunity terms antibodies, resulted lot confusion pandemic. Yes, truth know discern noise. teenagers ability sadly parents grandparents utterly lost Wild West media landscape. I’m anti-vax all, conspiracy nut anything, seemed crazy early test doses available middle March already?? mean basically got vaccinated day lockdowns started, didn’t realize already working far along point. Crazy. Yes! could buy pairs. figure extra one now, lol. Get back work peasants, rules follow, rule you. state coming twice daily cases per 100k people Mississippi. lot know long term effects getting virus, focus telling deniers that. literally heard media bubble allow information in.

They also know completely young healthy people get really sick certain genes, completely unpredictable people know hidden genes. That's matter opinion, could say thing Trudeau. assume case restaurants, shut down, slowing spending creating potential businesses close permanently.  Whereas grandma doesn’t come over, what’s real loss ? Slightly less grocery store sales ? want government telling do. 

There’s nothing explain, really. 

It seems many believe people “don’t understand” something. considered fully understand risks Covid yet STILL want government mandating things believe government power?

So explain away? don’t nothing say make believe government power lives. “The (insert thing) would better submitted government control” rational argument make, argument rejected. attacked police least 3 times trying get leave. read article, you? No. Mayors governors proclaim quarantine requirements universally ignored might enforceable anyway. Exactly right. I'm Alaska last week got emergency notification cell phones, alert that's used things like earthquakes volcano eruptions, T****-loving governor gives speech full asking suggesting recommending kind things we've told 9 fucking months. Yeah, worked well imagine would. Assholes. spread asymptomatically much higher IFR. Makes multitudes easier contain. Remember Amy K totally undermined Obama healthy school lunch program make tomato paste vegetable MN business could sell frozen pizza school kids?  How’s batshit? true.... EU strict measures winning  understand going specific instances. 

Say loved one hospital, going make it, miracle they’re going allow visit say 15-20 minutes, say last goodbyes (which know rare), I’d hopping plane get too. 

But that’s jot seeing. There’s actual uptick.  

It makes sense. probably got take precautions regular citizen can’t avail of. Table 3, model 3. Table S1 interest well.  arent winning ...

COVID sweep aged care facilities Melbourne, Australia. horrifying see amount vulnerable people suffer, especially since facilities petri dishes COVID.

Our total death toll 700 aged care memory... pretty terrifying see 300 four weeks rising. Facts that's Kim Reynolds think mostly still trying 'make up' states get borders open, show effort might actually required lot stigma work against. 


I fine wearing masks indoors precaution, also enjoyed getting cold anything year. EVERYONE Fred Meyer went weeks ago coughing sniffling. walked immediately turned around. Kroger Fred Meyer definitely problem right now. honestly also that. That's whole ballgame, yeah. That's effectiveness percentages represent. suppose could reverse engineer numbers out, know that. People already done personal risk assessment virus. 

Talking anyone pointless there’s really new information change risk assessments, won’t long vaccines rolled everyone. representative government, thats impossible. Officials elected based issues people deem important them. saying even makes sense congress president elected people. happens worker doesnt want take vaccine? hyperbole slightest. Agreed. Something better nothing whole country literally careening cliff several ways December. funding runs out. Government spending December 11th.

Fair, think state's local state government done good possible. perfect, really pretty good. Couple hospitals around full right now...  Well stop then? don’t go take care people once, huh? Yeah, whenever someone like “ terrible person, drugs bad things get them, blah blah blah, I’m successful business man, thanks lord Jesus Christ.” I’m like, “that’s great.”(subconsciously touches wallet make sure it’s still pocket).  much pharmacy charge stick though?

Don’t know allowed cause panic fear subreddit? it’s actually 99.85% chance recovery age 50. Also vitamin C reduces severity cases COVId...where articles promoting that? Oh, ffs. I'm sure already plenty. 


How entitled be? True. GF getting harassed family go big Thanksgiving. Covid everywhere right now. bet wanted check week two ago could method way back machine haven’t continuously tracking We've done already. That's trials for. sound like closet antivax. We'd benefit religious conservatives less control everything. know what’s would not? You’re washing detergent like 45 minutes draining it. 

Also sleeping mask on? Unless you’re sleeping room seems pointless. wrong recovering home? Doctors hospitals admit unless struggling breathe underlying conditions. No. need stay tf states lie beds made themselves. 

And then, behind us, need beat fucking faces pulp. worse all, teacher.... cynic thinks large, wealthy companies better access vaccine (or PPE testing) us healthcare workers. Stupid stupid does. like us

There's people work healthcare, people old, people military, people work ports, etc think.

When say ""general public"" mean like go CVS get it. mean like 5% population get spring. Shit, 6% getting shot *this year*. Another 10% something January (because they'll almost twice much time month December) production ramps 13% something February, etc on.

That's already approaching 3 every 10 people it. point phrase ""general public"" really matter much? time 80 million people vaccinated, everything going open. wife age start thinking want kids. first thought people joking baby boom really want hospital prenatal care delivery pandemic able parents around meet baby help bit? Add stress depression associated pandemic feeling isolated community talk baby kind stopped became clear virus going anywhere least 2021. Well could always go university. late assume you. take student debt pay insane statistic. Tell brother hope marriage fails. moving. nurses doctors social workers barely keeping together. Newsweek strikes understand people saying this. first amendment limits. well shouting ""Fire!"" crowded theatre territory. laws libel sedition books enough deal this. ""There dozens us!"" DOZENS!"" fake cure? „cure“ article linked right sub hospital. Something interactions proteins causing dangerous inflammation kills people. it’s cured already existing medicament. nothing like happened 2008. people buying houses able afford payments. may biased person living US government buying doses don’t think difference $2.50 vs $40 concern you’re thinking 60-70% vs 95% efficacy. You’re going want something protects health close 100% possible pay additional $37.50 think well worth it. can’t even video game $37.50. 

Additionally potential number people America electing get vaccinated you’re going want go giving many people 95% solution possible. don’t want 30% chance someone encountering disease getting sick spreading it. know folks went protests wear masks, quarantined got tested afterwards. Turns people protest social issues social conscience. Go figure. I'm genuinely starting think anxiety realist (when anxious things could actually happen least). Yep, fucked that’s common sentiment antivaxxer  Exactly, masks enough stop case growth US Europe- reducing number close contacts seems far effective. Hk never truly locked down. example restaurants closed 2 days. matter able work shop. don’t mandatory testing. gov keeps messing quarantine regulations blaming public. Gave excuse cancel elections. Yes, think that’s point making. anyone listening someone made people eat bugs money national tv? think secured some. getting general public vaccinated may take longer. Chronic Fatigue Community welcomes you. Wow. insolence mind-boggling. obviously stuck safe perspective instead seeing over-whelmed hospitals fact 238,000 people died chose ignore it. Kill people want, choose respect other's lives well-being instead ignorant. People stupid Spanish Flu gradually went away. Ignoring exacerbating it, frustrating continuing, thanks making continue longer should. going argue someone who's stuck world. local hospital canceled elective surgeries couple weeks ago. zero beds available right now. hospital case, restart surgery ten percent staff quarantine, there's beds, emergency room functioning icu? Senate majority refuses pass stimulus deal. want blanket immunity businesses lawsuits like side willing budge. 

Think that...millions Americans work, suffering, starving, evicted get help certain group wants protect asshole business owners legal liability. 70% people wore masks INDOOR (excepts home) probable would stop pandemic. 

A lot European countries tried mask wearing outdoor work. Iran guess 70% people wear masks outdoor. maybe 90% metro, banks closed governmental offices stop horrific current wave. Why? people still visit friends family indoor, magically everybody assumes safe territory take masks. many stories like emerging extremely worrisome read must ask... articles never provide context regarding hospital capacity ICU availability “normal” year. alarming situation first time ever happened? hospitals used seeing major surges time time various reasons? remember grandmother needed urgent care years ago told ICU beds available transfer hospital 150 miles away. (We live major US metro area) 2017 think due influenza epidemic year. Nowhere near US. We’re number one! Even get average 200k day, assuming testing missing 4-5x, million day, still many months start hitting even optimistic estimates heard immunity, year total coverage. Thats really cool. gotta get together Thanks Giving year? complain ICU Christmas. phx area 400 team soccer tournament last weekend, well organized sports events. Mask compliance, observations, (should be) summer spike got turned around.

I’m basically sheltering place, avoiding public exposure much possible. suspecting one one hand many anti-maskers claim vaccinated therefore go without mask-- despite lying vaccination begin with. hand, people vaccinated angry cannot go without masks.

On gripping hand^(1), people like get vaccinated continue wear masks People Smarter say fine go without.

So... zombies Damn  can’t tell whether go, things would contending with:

Potential reinfection parents. really unlikely. cases reinfection reported, pretty darn rare. isolating/minimizing sources exposure virus, it’s even less likely. It’s zero. risk seems pretty low. 

Potential brother become sick. Anyone immunized (via vaccine recovery virus) could still exposed virus transmit another person. also low risk immunized individual would carry less virus less time. it’s zero. god.

It's fking stupid. false. Parking mitary bases countries USA fought since ww2 paying health care. plenty countries universal health care USA actively defending Keep face mind....because CNN running story super spreader event held house got bunch people ill hospitalized (or killed), like ""Oh cool, last meal stuffing!""  really things people. go movies, festivals, concerts, bars. pretend close normal go camping alone lol

Granted, glad small hiking trips drives summer. beers outside. Felt okay that.

smh... NYC is, yet again, putting temporary hospital. time it’s Staten Island, hospital capacity almost gone.  Interestingly, people seem genuinely excited it.  people dying COVID meanwhile restaurant workers lost jobs might well land streets die. Crazy thing reality happens, hundreds thousands people die, especially hospitals get pushed capacity.  COVID-19 closer year! can’t tell you’re teenagers really stupid. especially, bright. 

It’s mindset, it’s reality. else know... wouldn’t here. Lol word looking ""queue"". Yeah, also see lot private businesses taking policies like liability reasons. Like see there's inevitably going kind case anti-vax moron spreads COVID someone else, let's say flight something, one infected people sues airline negligence medical bills take enough reasonable precautions regard COVID.

At least USA, think congress gave private sector liability shield. True. Although think Father Lies. said feels like cold mild flu day after, well soreness arra injection, similar side effects many vaccines.

Nothing long term yet, that's bad thing going fast.. way know long term effects without waiting long term. Except casinos, churches, bars, restaurants etc. 
It’s criminal negligence confirms: Black Friday going epic shitshow. Well that's beautiful thing internet everyone voice opinion. opinion didnt even try. China fucked us gave up. odds always 50/50. 🤓 Agreed. children, makes sense make vaccinations mandatory part responsible child care - always thought was, seems par feeding housing child properly, seeking medical care sick, vaccinating par forms neglect. That's dumb. long term, shelf stable better, squashing epidemic, need whatever get, soon possible. even matter needs refrigeration.... also stop counting Covid deaths we're it, everyone knows people stop dying stop counting deaths think joke dead people don’t need health care. But. people explain sick dying? ready 2 weeks later holiday cases present themselves. Great time son consider moving there... Yep. Optimistic normal summer. winter fucked. Many die. Health staff might lucky enough get vaccinated soon. got long winter ahead might die overwork, stress burnout. Spring might finally light. man. whole thing revealed ton US Americans. bad. sad. honestly view 50% Americans evil horrible monsters. need keep eye shoulder on. What’s easy fix?

I’ve using cloth masks Amazon they’ve working great. I’ve run problem exercising mask sucked inward (and making hard breathe). tests, virus /s. I'm you. told wife I'll first line whenever available. I'm group prioritized vaccine?

I mean 100mil doses available means decide gets first. Ok that's first responders, medical staff, elderly. That's fair mean everyone else option take vaccine can't fly? claiming permanent immunity? seems consensus people immunity least months. really fair planet tho  Covid got death rate 0.6%, massively overestimated it. probably closer 0.2-0.3% really clue talking Hopefully level 2 enough get cases back again. Well, yeah. people don’t want take basic precautions, result. Yeah last part big thing. Probably 90% everyone confirmed list, along similar percentage symptoms test we’re like people get sick 

What even mean? think last line article need:

 “I don’t think we’ll make January,” Perencevich said. Yes is. vaccine would took 10+ years develop, developed 8 months quick, vaccine distributed several orders magnitude faster Polio vaccine considered quick. Oxford vaccine stored normal fridge temperatures. logistics starting come together.

Also Canada: work us???

Our government must taking lessons Australian government. shame delayed questions regarding delivery system regarding vaccine itself. needs spread parlor 4channel ect.

It’s BS, buy get things control businesses schools open public confidence won’t close month. people care individual freedoms. want free go whatever want things open. want free wear mask, wear them.

Must suck live pessimistic life . Yeah, would ""leader"" ever want act like leader. I’d probably require evidence vaccinated + symptoms temperature check boarding plane get in. least developing countries get lot money tourism, like southeast asian countries. two cents. 

And that’s ok nobody expert lol I’m gonna watching every morning get hyped Well, misspoke sense majority meaning healthcare vs non-healthcare workers. physically possible. believe made 16% cases article read. health officials refused work half country? every state uncontrolled spread. I'm going summer, deaths lagged cases 26 days. However different states shorter longer delays reporting deaths, winter might slightly different again. Yeah sister getting stir crazy. usually always travel Christmas. numbers down, tossed around idea small road trip, numbers going back quickly, said “no way.” 

I’ll Memorial Day/once vaccine out. move goal posts I’m vaccines, sorry Charlie. rushing bar concert certainly staying inside backyard I'm going admit, CNN rolling stories Christmas people hurt killed family members (who they're supposed care about) infected Thanksgiving, I'm going feel empathy hospital workers treat self-absorbed ""people"".

People unfortunately going reap they're sowing right now. care keeping family safe staying away one holiday season tiny sacrifice ensure they're ok healthy. actually love family.

I hope stay home stay safe holiday season. could pfizer licenced distribute vaccine, since BioNTech retain worldwide rights ? Oxford vaccine least appears 90% effective dosing regimen, another vaccine quickly produced scale. Sure, things equal take efficacious vaccine can, especially paying yourself. reality, either situation - means doses vaccinate people quicker
Id happily take slightly less effective vaccine, meant rolling faster getting things control society quicker less half year now. bad. Ah, that's got mixed up. look stupid. Deep stuff brother Ridicule help. live little bubble. commit litany legal offenses every day.

We've gotten weirdly used right wing media able openly state certain politicians America-hating, baby eating, communist ""globalist"" pedophiles, everyone kind of... shrugs. libel (and likely sedition, actionable things). right lawyers enough money political could grind OANN dust. need stop pretending first amendment protects kind speech. doesn't. Wonder could applied cancer way since many cancers uncanny way telling cells 'Hey we're safe, kill us' certain protein - maybe CD-147 example?

kill one every ten (a group soldiers others) punishment whole group. Sick winning? true medical professionals high risk people get access early vaccination. people, masks come within weeks vaccinated. Pretty much soon sticks. 

By time public gets vaccinated spring. point highest risk people already either got COViD vaccinated. That, along weather, drive R numbers rapidly. 

We also won’t incompetent president less crazy contact tracing aggressively deploy tests, quarantines vaccines areas outbreaks. even goes back message boards 00s administrators basically put foot people online love acting like children. ban really reason like like it, go somewhere else post here.

Though time that's stuff like 8chan happened ban people totally batshit dangerous crazy go somewhere. hope get mass end news. Oooh. Oooohhhh good! TIL wearing mask? Well, he's done enough crack meth become walking side-effect, so.... I'm Boston too, colleagues report thing. mean, see people -with masks-. they're wearing nose whole story. I've never inside CVS grocery store without 1-2 nose hangers. that's stores. Every time contractor kind fight get keep mask (in house!) Americans stupid? Mine wasn’t bad. would take week work relax. Get frozen peas make sure take antibiotics strain yourself. Unfortunately, lots intelligent people get cults. 

Intelligence alone judgement susceptibility. Whoa, government funded tax payers? thought whole time growing money trees! discoveries us, Sherlock? hint Thank kind response. stressful, also rewarding. hope help make people's lives better vulnerable. grieve, must much harder family members loved ones dying covid - many able visit person often, all, months, late, never see again. many residents survived, continue carry keeping them, families, safe can. Tony Evers order covid positive elderly nursing homes like Cuomo did? truly pathetic thing reddit top comments stories like comments unrelated story, especially story related issues democrat controlled state, invariably thread turn military Republicans completely absolving democrat leadership blame. Truly fucking pathetic. Could find infecting someone vaccinated measure contagious? little different taxes already paying go testing compared shelling cash, right? Wait why’d stop hitting downvote button time? fun worth noting title refers ""efficient"" masks like n95s, assumes people wore mask correctly. I’m glad you’re comfortable wearing it! I’m not, don’t like it. wear it, understand it’s importance *right now*. 

It’s enjoyable wearing something strapped mouth. It’s enjoyable conversations peoples covered faces. Body language facial expressions important pieces human communication. suggest away would massive blow human communication know it. 

*“You know else uncomfortable? Covid, moron”*

Yes know, millionth time, important wear mask right now. Hello? God? pass massage Reddit? I, FatOrangeCat understand important wear mask right now! safe general public so, covid cases low enough isn’t risk overwhelming hospitals, incredibly overjoyed take mask of, smile world. helps people stay safe though, that's important.

If someone decides go mask-off gets sick, least calculated risk.

If one wears mask riding bus work guaranteed COVID anyone can't afford car, well sucks.

I ""saved"" COVID measures multiple times. shoulder-to-shoulder guy 3 days intensive experiment. tested positive COVID days later. work mask always surgical masks. never caught COVID. Another time guy shift tested positive (we get weekly tests) taken work day supposed prolonged contact training.

At least good measures place, exposures far voluntary. Ah, Toledo... stay classy! 

As aside, I've never understood woman calling man handle fight. man drove store confront man asked two women wear mask. shooter even involved situation. One thing remember though: algorithm -hates- demonetized videos, actively avoids pushing possible. channel watch (self) demonetized, never end casual recommendations, check subscriptions notifs release new video. average missing point. 

What point banning concerts going happen anyway. Lol  idiots sub 12x day. Where’s idiot buschdiesel? No, internet usage minimal. local processing electrical uses. 


A simplified overview things work computer downloads small file analyzes it. ton variables file take anywhere minutes several days finish file. uploads results downloads another file. Huh, never thought I'd sorry see Covid19 go! better mean corporations getting first. done age group essential workers get Still source says anything COVID admitted. doubting sir journalists know vague means specific. cannot held liable false information it’s vague. course there’s 85,000 people hospitals country that’s normal I’m sure COVID would seem something you’d specify. Yep definitely possible. significant test month later (someone work positive) results test negative well. Still like said, definitely false positive negative tests. Poor little snowflakes administrator local hospital reach get contractor ones. So, using them; desperation suppose. Man don’t even like sub fuck it. r/angryupvote place stupid shit comments. hobby? I'm replying change mind. people read nonsense may think way without rebuttal. I'm clearly triggering you, still replying, still responding. yes someone thinks ok people suffer comfortable, yes let know think. cant help ring true. look forward ""I dont care care"" response. story kinda strange whatever orthopedic surgeon

Or maybe even literal, youtube government organization. independent company decided punish another independent organization spreading misinformation people like eat like slop.

Good them. suspicious Covid19 top cause cop deaths year. shootings car accidents *combined.*

'Tis 'tis! Funny guys didnt ban anyone people saying exact thing New York cities. Contagion serious watching anyone right now.

It's frightening much got correct (Steven Soderbergh said consulted back 2011 film). Right Jude Law's character running fake news website selling fake cures cultivating following attacking health experts. Oh, virus film originating bats Chinese wet markets crossed another species infecting humans. I've rewatched many times year, kind helps process what's happening. Ah yes “secret weddings” “secret concerts” (first time I’ve heard these) TOTALLY isn’t living restrictions lol. Same. Good friend got March enlarged heart scarring multiple organs. Easy test quantify. 34 home w ‘mild’ case. wish balls ram head brick wall. pain would miniscule compared reading fucking captain obvious drivel.  daughter see optometrist months ago. said, ""I bet never thought job would get dangerous"" said ""That's never paid student loans."" 😂

Seriously, though, best wishes. Stay safe! make mandatory, thing make impossible interact anyone else society unless vaccinated. I'm surprised say conspiracy global elite everything shut down, people lost livelihoods, rich got even wealthier. fact, everyone stop getting tested, also stop going doctor's hospital Covid symptoms?! Technically we've won! Wonder middle name started K too. /s

I read condescending email doesn’t need wear mask hoped would remove leader. People ( like me) thought doctors charge hospitals rude awakening virus. Yeah! even single bad thing exists, try fix bad things! good ideology lead good things!

/s move Greenland, gonna bee’s knees It’s always Clackamas county I’m talking contractor grade masks cause hospitals didn’t get either use surgical grade N95 blue green ones. think told employees that’s going tell didn’t go there. masks probably went different countries Super smart move. sake population, company. Fedex missed boat. thought testing free

It was. long. another quirk English 

That one bad. [Try People country still care. Depending test received, might false negative. tests 30 percent false negative rate. rapid antibody go high 50 percent. Btw, think underplay well Oz handled it. handled well. friends Oz myself, told worried careful even zero cases. testament maturity nation ability protect itself. 👍🏽

Edit: Friends doctors, quite tuned front line April 5th highest world per capita deaths. checked month ago so, Sweden dropped 17. Today they're 21st. wonder they'll 6 months. number preventable deaths acceptable still allowed drive. She’s early 50’s somewhat overweight. Im saying youre guaranteed end like (that’s said youre young healthy youll fine), offered advice take precautions since asked tips. arguing for? Let COVID go unchecked? think 250k dead Americans 8 months significant? Or, let guess, numbers made up, right? That’s say. Self-reporting, like random person says internet, unreliable anecdotal evidence best. end, long places people could group without masks (like restaurants, bars, private gatherings parties), amount wearing masks 70% time instances gonna prevent surge cases. means sources infection displaced, eliminated. especially claim economic persecution powers want know TRUTH! bad! lol got 2nd 3rd try. I'm surrounded morons think like hard tell. initial report came up.  deaths. It’s local news here. 7 related one wedding. Trust me. mean, like purpose life kind comment. People look forward days feel special (pandemic aside) felt normal day basically . Slight dizzy whatever malaise probably bleach rectal lightbulbs lol. minks transmit virus humans, children wold not? lead mass death *in Iowa* though. people want keep denying it, certainly that. irony comment hilarious. Typical reddit. unfortunately repeat myself. refuse real conversation hurl insults. It’s pathetic. sad. it’s internet stranger lol. Yet still keep responding. You’ll never million years trigger me. can’t offended you, it’s impossible. Yet you’re trying best respect Oh didn’t think dismissive! think you’re right think could happen. think case though going test results impossible explain away. alarming typo I’ve seen week! Disgusting. Absolutely revolting Youtube! channel misinformation still allowed run? ex. selling nutrition supplements. politically motivated. “We see signs immunity population slowing infection right now.”

To everyone gave many others downvotes hell March April said mistake going big regret...

Told you! 😝

In seriousness, hope everyone stays safe. reality matters none right wrong what... it’s self education staying safe. That’s all. Yeah living Chicago hate frigid cold. skiing type face mask stay warm definitely got stared at. 

Now it’s normal! Huzzah! putting eggs America First basket, maybe Canada checked name starts letter A

There shortage vaccines world, China, Russia, Europe US, there'll billions doses going around even poorest countries.

All Canada take sides work everyone, no, goes Canadian government's long running policy America first sarcastic. people adamant living fear usually scared shadows! wait two weeks... article gives averages cities, easy adopt probability formula unique situation. think somebody meeting higher chance covid plug smaller number .95. example .3 means 70% chance covid.

People general notoriously bad cumulative probabilities. They'll think 1% population it, random group 30 people low chance somebody it. actually 26%.

You also cumulative probabilities leave house. Lmao, evidence masks effective. fucking course tons scientific studies support that. scientifically proved masks masks intended year 2020 fucking crazy thinking. 21 upvotes comment. Seems like problem accusation dishonesty. Oh along first responders essential workers. say someone pots, managed. “100% symptom free” managed, “much higher quality life before” managed. started ressurecting people lower numbers ofc read dry humid weather increase ""lifespan"" air, temperature effect too. Moderate humidity better. epidemological statistics drives laws. people want wear masks anymore politicians say wont to.

It's almost certain mask mandates stop earlier experts think public pressure. said long time ago there's probably going post-COVID clinics support groups next 60 70 years, like polio post-polio syndrome day. Different mechanism obviously, diseases like pop surprises 5, 10, even 20 years track could never anticipate, COVID starting early trend. Damn dude, hope feel better getting chest. I'm serious. Everyone's carrying lot pent anger, man, go punch pillow. dragged man something control over. 

Oh I'm gonna lie, we're Super impressed amazing family handling right now. sound like great!!

Sorry Mr. Eat Ass. know need someone jumping help it. We're frustrated right think deserved that. got enough deal without completely ""unselfish"", holier thou dude ripping new one (I mean, know eat anyhow it'll go waste). electron circling nucleus atom blown size orange example… would 3 mile radius nucleus. Modern science still stumped day. say something cannot identified. call ether.

Never heard claims before. Care share proof ? stumped. 

In case, describing still god gaps. many people studied highest level physics atheist, spiritual/religious.

Some proof modern gap two remains Many words Socrates still remain valid day.

He philosopher.

Not astrophysicist. 

Many/most words Nietzsche also valid today. can't lie population expect believe tell truth. Thanks heartfelt concern. I'm sure thoughts prayers help us difficult time. Sweden fudge numbers. report Tuesday Friday now. Tuesday reported 94 new deaths, backdated them, see daily deaths, Sweden like 11 day looked Tuesday. look two weeks now, Tuesday 24. November jumped, definitely cannot compare day day Sweden particular day unless 2 weeks ago. feel sorry apologize confusion, never trying say vaccines necessary, period. fully understand benefit vaccine necessary.

It reaching point going back away information.  
I anti-masker, covid denier. frustrated, unable sleep good, stressed. But, like everyone else.  
I like data, single numbers. able see top layer information help understand things happening well.... .. 
I mean fix technology. There's reason behind this. ;) 
Anyways. Yeah. assume everything up, experts best interest public - way around. one less thing think about. We’re talking kidney transplants, we’re talking avoidable disease. Grow someone POTS (we guess) frequent strep throat kid, isn’t surprising. Hopefully increases number autonomic testing labs hospitals, brings awareness syndrome, often overlooked due symptoms undefined. 50 percent? Can't read article needs sign in.. test positivity rate coming back 10-15 percent PPL actually getting tested. odds 50 percent big dining table sure No, fuckers care 'ThE eCoNoMy', fuck vulnerable unexpected casualties, fuck doctors hospital workers, fuck get lasting damage even mild symptoms.

It's ok care economy, cannot healthy one unless Pandemic controlled/limited. Eh screw whats worst happen. miss guys jobs available (see LinkedIn’s master list) low- no-skill part-time minimum wage jobs huge turnover normal times. employees last 6 months year usually end little drill sergeants treat new workers like absolute garbage. In Germany, health authorities reported 410 new coronavirus-related deaths Robert Koch Institute (RKI) within 24 hours. new high thus reached Wednesday (as November 25th, 00:00). total number deaths rose 14,771. highest level date reached mid-April 315 reported deaths within one day.

How things different compared last year?

Are stores open? Business usual? matrch?? dam crazy around whole year since covid started mainly first cases started january 27th canada us Actually look streets, people getting used way life now. 

We automatically masks indoors, automatically check SafeEntry despite places don’t people checking.  husband’s dad died myocarditis bout pneumonia 13 years ago. 45. husband 27 now, genetics I’m afraid heart health catch covid. true. Western European locked couple weeks ago daily infection numbers down, dropping. law style

Here Florida, Governor pledged lockdown, matter bad gets, Governor horrible human being.  Man, becoming clusterf*ck.

With misinformation going around, find hard form truth-based opinion.

A weeks ago anti-corona crew yelling Sweden absolutely nothing prevent anything, worked. 
People comments pro-corona crew however telling Sweden opted 'take responsability' approach, people actually listened.
Other commented can't compare Sweden countries population density (which agree on).

Others compared Sweden countries surrounding Sweden point Sweden worse.

Now they're saying Sweden actually stricter measures Finland etc.

With cherry picking (mainly Belgium Italy anti crew, countries pro crew) misinformation going around clear: ""confirm opinion"" way, way important people ""telling truth"".

Tl,dr: corona related article mentions Sweden, likely skip it. information, confirmation. dry oxygen then? Cunning linguists successfully managing pandemic looks like. 6 months community spread everyone looking other. Freedom come small price, everyone knows that. tried didnt work think something wrong idk law style

1 - appears several internal email dialogues March-April become public, Anders Tegnell Johan Giesecke (who hired consultant help w strategy) saw many benefits herd immunity-strategy. 

2 - even appears one mail Tegnell clearly states chosen strategy herd immunity didn’t see lockdown TTI realistic alternatives. 

3 - Tegnell praised Britains herd immunity strategy, days scrapped it. said similar Sweden’s scientific strategies. 

4 - Swedish authorities careful always talk “flattening curve” explicit goal achieving slow spread hospitals overloaded. never talked minimizing eradicating spread avoid people get ill die much possible. 

5 - Sweden done relatively little surpress spread. Authorities even argued actively hindered several preventivt measures: Masks, broad testing, pro contact tracing, tougher restrictions bars crowd sizes, isolation asymptomatic close contacts kind measures schools. 

6 - Swedish authorities experts cooperate announced herd immunity would around corner April, may, June, July. Every time turned optimistic claim without hard evidence back up.

7 - Swedish authorities repeatedly claimed high level immunity achieved Sweden would great benefit later on, claimed would much better Norway, Finland Denmark autumn winter it. 

8 - leader Christian Democrat opposition party said “In discussions Prime Minister heads authorities, sounded great benefits strategy Sweden chosen, would much higher degree immunity result higher degree spread infection.”

&amp;#x200B;

In contrast argument you’ll ever hear Tegnell denied herd immunity strategy. It’s beneficial side effect. strategy flatten curve. End story. 

But looks like fish, smells fish swims like fish... even matter choose call mysterious creature? particules end europe stay suspended days. virus requiered travel dessert, stick particles arrive here.

Yes, heard term ad hominem. know means? hospital visit thing confuses me. making inpatients wear time too, even they’re sleeping? impressive maybe hard reproduce many things could done Europe good reason.

* gone skiing right next outbreak Italy. 

* allowed people leave area outbreak Italy.

* governments lied masks working left hospital staf. Instead encouraged self made masks.

* lockdowns happened earlier.

* lockdowns lasted new cases 2weeks like Wuhan.

* contact tracing people persistent.

* Testing given resources efforts people could tested. 

* gone vacations summer countries.

* second lockdown happened sooner.

But people won't, Canada America, beyond dangerous, beyond stupid.

I honestly think one vital times things need get draconian hell - absolutely mandatory mask laws curfews, serious prison time break rules. Draconian fines. Draconian punishment. exceptions, disease beaten. mandatory vaccination, arrives, escape responsibility, excuses ignorance conspiracy mongering.

This saves nations. necessary many people really, actually capable responsible. capable adulting real, factually dangerous world. People stupid live... endangers us responsible, wise, intelligent.

If there's one thing pandemic shown, failure pay use system. 


If individuals pay own, poor people able pay. Since likely get infected (living conditions) know (bc tested) risk disease spreading higher.


If government pays gives freely, people likely get tested risk disease spreading reduced. Plus, cost testing lower government buys bulk.

This excerpt below, might explain vaccines effective short time scale, may last.

It makes sense, vaccine engages immune system, give protection short run infections. 

How effective flu vaccine first 2 months?


“Many studies documented evidence negative interference viruses caused short-lived (days) protection elicited first infection. Host antiviral interferon responses often regarded main mechanism interference manifests; is, result recent infection, host cells up-regulate synthesis interferons, potentially inhibiting secondary infection. Even though short-lived, effect strong population scales temporarily reduce prevalence virus shift timing circulation. example, hypothesized large summer 2009 rhinovirus outbreak delayed pandemic influenza virus emergence Europe (13).” said almost. Religion make people good. Good people make religions better. I'm already agnostic Buddhist. respect pope. publications, go “HURR DURR SORCES” fuck shit. 

There fuck ton information links times depression issues upbringing people lack empathy go kill later life. 

Il link want, look age demographic serial killers born. going big rise 2035. instead losing football match 7-1, lost 4-1. Wonderful.  Sure, we're going call 911 every time someone comes without mask. Grow up. would call cops three times week, least. 

Everyone reading exchange thinking staff refuse service non-mask wearing scofflaws, call cops every time someone pops without mask fucking moron. flawed statement. glad mask see jaw hit ground. Englishman find insane that's got 1200 dollars. still furlough scheme going UK pay 80% wage £2500/month

How fuck possible survive $1200 6 months whatever authoritarian? 

Are one people think liberals communists same? Yeah, dislike anti vaccine BS too. Really annoying people misinformed think know everything know vaccinations. I’m that. Well, banned public spaces without masks might get arrested try force way without mask. restrictions see stops curfews red zones. Chinese people complain Chinese government often exactly get covered Western media. vice versa, sense Chinese people often highly support government issues condemned Western media governments, people actually experience something different even opposite twisted version reported West. Border control pretty important aspect whole strategy well. Well, I'd say Hiroshima Nagasaki still argued for. calculations made assumed similar number deaths US side things mainland Japan taken conventionally. 9/11 however pure cowardice Ah ok. fault, I’m frustrated headlines like bolster anti vaccine propaganda. Sorry. “During”? say “These worst places be” end quote? really don’t see ending ever. I’m sorry, I’m convinced. Swede refusing see reality, know Sweden never herd immunity strategy thought another post. people choose wear masks *out volition* post-pandemic, would reason would bad thing? think no, seems people feel rather strongly it. literally military already much ""Everyone wants test get one, cost."" get one gonna cost you. repeatedly  you’re saying testing less people last week? would cases going compared week states even two weeks ago? only. America worst country world millions people homeless soon. Show Western country restricts information like China does, I'll wait covid immunity comes two vaccinations seen too, guess people think never happen them. personally know people confronted random people public, violence, get shouting match would bad one infected. like road rage, really need think through. agree you, I'm gong shoot you???  next time I'm planned parenthood shoot protesters right? mean scream face walk in. def minding business. white projection. lashing out, wailing, flailing see dying empires. really doesn’t explain India though. levels particulates air INSANE compared almost everywhere else world, yet CFR remarkably low things considered. “Mouthbreather” didn’t come nowhere amazon.com e-commerce website allowed posts comments.

....seriously? lol put foam cooler dry ice, vaccine, dry ice top -60 seafood freezer help slow sublimation dry ice?

You'd better putting cooler dry ice bigger cooler, i.e. better insulate it. That's vaccines transported convenient way store end point still needs dry ice supply. delay saying like metrics shown peak two weeks ago see peak subsequent decline. I’ve battled idea many times sub people wanted believe increases would spiral infinity reason waves always crash. Check worldometer seven day rolling cases average Wisconsin, Illinois, Ohio, Iowa, South Dakota, Michigan, Tennessee (although data jump around bit). 

Indiana, Minnesota, North Dakota seemed peaked well. 

It’s basically pattern everywhere across world. There’s exceptions, it’s say things could get worse holidays things like that. right based human mitigation states trending better direction one argument read past essential workers like grocery stores necessarily higher risk getting **spreading** covid19. also read argued vaccinating young, healthy likely spreading medical workers &amp; people nursing homes stop spreading.

as someone lower list I'm good essential workers coming sake rest us around too.  demonetized week forever?  Indiana resident here. live Indianapolis, normal city state. Rest state trash. answered questions 130 people sufficient make conclusion broader general population. Pfizer ended trial 170 COVID cases, seems like small sample size.

I pose /r/sino rampant anti-China propaganda Western mainstream media. Unless prove otherwise, also engaging slimey low-effort propaganda Western MSM accusing people shills. pathetic. -20 days... minute now! Authoritarianism science! biggest thing got wrong hand sanitizer still stock people started looting grocery store.  old people meant die

People pushed crap ALREADY failed contain virus. defend politicians' failures, nothing else.

If asked pandemic would said 200000+ people dying bad, okay Trump cult said okay. both? seems like everybody rich paying right now. Implying kind shortage ubiquitous refrigeration technology existed hundred years hey I'm mongolian, triggered one lashing out. I'm 9ms pregnant organs, lungs included, smashed together like sardines. Yet wear mask. remember correctly back July/August, taking something like 25-28 days roughly see resultant spike deaths. appears may getting *slightly* faster reporting much. means great things winter get. fear one day highly transmissible prion disease. Guess I'm staying island dump Imagine thinking one side planet things, must nice naive. Incentives sell, buy?  Recent studies indicate reinfection rare. Hey man there’s plenty reasons shoot someone don’t make piece shit. Guess brings us back original comment disagreed already, guess we’re done here. over?

Well election -20 days... day now!  oops sarcasm tag, it’s completely true. got downvoted people said mind business. Arguing people futile, guy minded business backward-ass Kentucky literally give fuck masks like that. That's justifying shot, reality situation chose put in. Sad! friendly reminder science religion, cannot accept deny it. bunch methods. Hence article makes sense.

Science! new religion atheists. get memo? suck. make feel harder breath even though functionally make harder breath. can't see people's mouths large part communication. wired read react people's facial expressions masks obscure communication. terribly uncomfortable, like uncomfortable pair underwear...like...I would rather wear day to. People's noses different too. experience mine tbf. nose get's little bit mushed mask clogs sinuses hours. ~wrong~ crazy. vaccinated kid shots needed. got flu shot. I'm also little leery brand new vaccine platform rushed trials ""warp speed"". I've committed *not* taking it. I'm skeptical like you. pretty fucking weird people shitting people healthy reasonable amount skepticism. almost feels astroturfy. Anyway, nothing wrong skeptical wanting see data even little apprehensive. use AstraZeneca vaccine, require ultra-cold storage.  Lol. 
r/parlerwatch “But can’t breathe mask”

They need find better mask tbh. easily get KF94s place, including amazon.

Not uncomfortable all. heart. wouldnt consider subreddit great brainwash imbeciles like ever since started? mean 98% everything fear mongering bullshit Virus less 1% mortality rate. healthcare worker ""frontlines"" ever since started find amusing much bullshit fearr inducing crap posted here. [Here’s explainer John  get far giving companies credit, remember required feds vaccine designed, studied given highly controlled settings, every patient control person studied before, after.

This different, ‘knowable’ situation compared entire virus (which larger vaccine fragment) acting freely throughout entire community.

We actually say extremely likely immune least months. Beyond that, cannot say scientific certainty long 99% last. also don’t know immunity right really 99% undetected reinfections walking around mild cases present immunity like 95%... maybe even possibly 90%.  scientist give actual facts known factual present.  ""Slippery slope"" logical fallacy reason. deplatform radical conspiracy theory nuts mean they'll also start censoring conservative voices. there's really little daylight crazies mainstream conservatives get nervous maybe self reflection rather asking private companies nicer them. 

""Where end?"" somewhere. 

If Neo-Nazi walked business owned, talking holocaust fake, kick out. kick breitbart quoting alt right like Shapiro. Others draw line differently that's right, got nothing free speech everything tolerate polite conversation privately owned spaces. That's social media companies wrestling right now. we, business, draw line we'll tolerate space. Hate speech? Dangerous conspiracies? Doxing? They'll land slightly different it'll evolve time, slippery slope banning conservative voices.  Good lord comment article. trying analyze every scenario. impression interest starting dialogue get pissed call 'ignorant' (is welcome thread? see edited comment said said. wrong enough change it, guess honest thing would apologize too) accept kind threats.

What? edited comments. call ignorant. say comments saying company report negative data shows lack knowledge area.

It's ""threat"". talking one people run sub. I'm warning rules end banned removed comments. welcome whatever theories like. obviously disagree rooted evidence fact. glide misinformation anti-vax language end banned. guys drawing line days? Would banned suggesting systematically defunding state local governments tax cuts, many places do, leaves unable cope crises like COVID? they're pretty demonic too. 

I thought politically correct term mortally challenged? people comply law. men draft dodgers certainly admired. consequences pretty serious well. people pay taxes, may try legally avoid tax, tax evasion crime really destroy lives businesses. Driving without drivers license lands lot people court, car towed impounded 30 60 days.  idea people flout laws childish best basically literally criminal worst. must need help basic comprehension skills. way shape form say vaccinations? However, bit hesitant put 💯 faith government science community comes brand new vaccination directly impact economy.  government already showed us value economy human life. truthful us. CDC contradicts every month. 

I honestly think people would go blindly question “Time take tin foil off.” Unfortunately, science become politicized feel CDC listening much White House hard believe comes mouths likely already committed assault rushing raised arm. arrested that. think Wisconsin better Iowa Indiana neither states wanted kind restrictions. time Pitzker shut Illinois already hitting Chicago hard, let's face it, higher apartment buildings wicke quicker spread. Iirc Twin Cities going bad while, too. Evers best shut legislature punch opened back everyone sick restrictions lived within 50 miles Illinois, Minnesota, Michigan came party masks. people thought okay exactly types taking seriously first place, I'm sure that's lot cases got in. look Illinois' second third wave starts around borders moves we're surrounded lax/no restrictions anyone close border wanted go bar it. Fair enough, far know, one state stopped dining drinking...

Kind gaping chasm ask Seems like people can't handle reality people want wear masks. harmless behaviour. Probably adjusted population size Parler racist?  might touch extreme say doesn’t spread outdoors all. yes, guidance pretty clear outdoors much lower risk indoors. I'm headed well. I'm realist, want vaccinated also realize Murphy's law real vaccine rollout probably quick efficient planned. get vaccinated July I'll consider win. drive otherwise leave house? Taxes paid roads. kids family members attended public schools, you? Taxes paid those. ever needed use unemployment? Taxes paid that. ever state national park appreciated beauty? Taxes paid that. Need go on? bet lots people complained rationing said violation freedoms, history books like make things sound nicer really were. Testing reaching bottleneck. Keep eye test positivity rates hospitalizations. Then, look excess deaths rear view mirror see really happened. would anything get vaccinated new year. multiple high risk conditions terrified Covid. know medical staff needs first damn eager get vaccinated. wish trolling. loved ones would die got flu. Children die every year flu completely preventable. 

What wearing masks prevent flu deaths seems like ""trolling"" you? Hi dad! find interesting said vaccination plural sense. 

So vaccinations feel mandatory? new ones come?

I love automatically condemn someone want get vaccinated person makes poor decisions lacks critical thinking. live here. born raised I've lived states say authority California fucking awesome. tell live here! fair, COVID-19 boring pandemic. Like recording car wreck high speed camera loading one slideshow picture frames. always gruesome, mostly carnage. numerous stories like around midwest since pandemic started. Like I've seen posts term ""nurse"" wide category 1 year programs 4 year programs more. ain’t science Bubb. mean quotation marks, way here? always take Ireland example. Ireland used covered oak trees- joke squirrel could run northern southern tip island without touching ground. Then, British came cut trees. factors big one. So, next generation kids grew Ireland lots rolling green grassy hills. Pretty, totally different, ecologically speaking. Humans come world thinking whatever going normal. hear tales way used sad truth people ever want go back old ways people never experienced them. time old ways really gone, people knew large either dead close it. ""Protecting woman"" obvious everyone antibody studies showed ridiculously low IFR fraction worst hit places infected spring wave. There's argument herd Immunity since May. I've following along everyone else hearing vaccine 2 shots article reason. 

This going deter Lot people getting vaccine one done shot. I'm getting questions asked, know lot people would learn going two separate visits. good. forgot reply :( Wait I'm curious, modern day Americans perceive Pacific War? nobody's mentioning atrocities Japanese Empire. totally know ""persuadable"" guys time. Yeah diplomacy could absolutely worked planning die man defend mainland. Germany, we're currently deaths moronic anti-maskers. least 2850 deaths could avoided Autumn, that's 20 % total.

14,866 deaths (now) Germany equal 1853 deaths Sweden.

12000 deaths Germany equal 1495 deaths Sweden.

Sweden 4.3 times death avoided second wave if-we-were-smart Germany, 3.5 times death stupid-as-is Germany. like Sweden, Germany would 52147 deaths now.

It's death, also suffering survive. parents born tail end ww2. interesting thing mother ever told childhood barely men life. many men died families became households widowed wives raising kids together. told casually like normal.

Young, children right tell kids grandparents children. recall grandparents seeing old people facetime/zoom month/week last saw doctors nurses. acceptable. likely drive shots... least while. That’s way first test back April, never got car everyone administering test thoroughly masked. fat one already proves lie. Aye gloves now. Except math wrong. 260,000 13,000,000 .02%, .02 2%. mask dinosaurs it, im going stop wearing im forced to.

Also, someone medical issues, use public restrooms frequently masks great help. comparison oann apt. suddently matters? Seems like vaccine gonna arrive. big companies placing orders cold storages makes us understand vaccine gonna arrive anytime starting see first round vaccines. suspect Pfizer Moderna continue develop vaccines point distributed normal supply channels.

I also suspect move model like flu vaccine people receive annual vaccine protects multiple corona viruses. course, probably least two years away.

Perhaps, wishful thinking part, vaccine development going may finally see vaccine common cold well. follows R&amp;D money spent drug companies want look ways apply it. if, Illinois broke. emails indicate took part discussion strategy? virus spread like wildfire lockdowns postpone spread? particular sports, we're talking schools' winter holidays, week 7,8 10 Denmark.

Its right there. require different schooling. One degree doesn’t qualify work field. Respiratory therapy degrees much narrow focus nursing degrees. get it. Y'all give played joke rest 🙄 Wrong.  


This translated wording relevant part contract: 

”The assignment means Johan Giesecke support unit analysis work modeling analysis Covid-19. scope maximum 800 hours 2020.

The assignment carried professionalism, quality, competence business acumen expected senior expert.”

That open job description. “To help strategy“ fair way describe contribution. contrast “modelling” specialised field itself, usually reserved people background mathematics programming. 

We know May Giesecke sent authorities bill full months work, included talking media. scandal contract terminated early. 

Furthermore highly unusual write imprecise job description contract worth almost million Swedish kronor. r/stopdrinking? dudes saved life. work health division organization working educating parts. tell right least 50% want right away, bothersome.

Smh No, Moderna one kept slightly higher temperature. There's confusion need use different cold temperatures different lengths time.

The ultracold freezers longer term storage (e.g., six months). We're basically going use fast make it, though, long term storage matter much.

They need something closer regular freezer temps point distribution. we'll see central storage ultra cold temps, shipments doctor's office dry ice (which, frankly, hard US, given premium steak company sends 4M packages frozen steaks dry ice annually, mostly holidays), local storage regular freezer days, defrost fridge temps used 24 hours. Yeah plan. months away that. 😭🍼👶🏻 things keep getting worse point hospitals can't take people, lucky ones. unlucky die outside hospital without sedation effective pain medication ease passing.

US everyone talking family Thanksgiving.. going Black Friday? Unthinkable. lie matter. Fake news Sweden. sub sucks.

This report incorrect point. doesn’t take increased testing account period. \*3. look data (and trend) deaths ignore latest two weeks data incomplete. can't compare day day anyway. Sunday Monday reports useless weekend comparing quality paperwork. Nope, got different weeks sports vacation know. can’t people video chat? You’d obviously *rather* see loved ones person, many people know live work far families get together even non-pandemic years. 

I idea many families close would rather get together stay healthy. Maybe family unusual, however. seen little public discussion vaccine passport involves? much hate say it, actually looks like decent application blockchain.

Is going physical piece paper? digital version? standardization vaccines/countries? prevent forgeries? tied individual? prevent borrowing someone else's? happens lose it, get replaced?

Let's say aged care home wants establish policy one allowed without vaccine passport, hardware need buy? much longer take enter premise? hours access? work sporting arena? nightclub? airport?

I feel like planning stages 6 months ago we're going find 3 months none planned all. Lol said wear mask. abnormal thing news telling us terrible. Still waiting happen. people need go back end line shun wearing masks taking precautions. last treatment. I'd part triage lie detector. red light goes on, door go tent parking lot 10% population outside Sweden

So Denmark No. believe consequences actions affected. Even deny deathbed. worked us thus far. work lab processes COVID tests, won’t first wave one ones after. saying availability around late January early February want it. He's pandering masses, there's election coming always someone job. Good guy Ford  guess someone else flu shot well Sound like idea.

Yes looks really cool, like fuckin 350 dollars. mean absolute bargain compared real Bugatti, still. Yes do. Hopefully reproduce create new generation morons guess summer 2021. impossibly unlikely Pfizer Moderna cooked books round, knew FDA going spend 3 weeks scouring test results.

Also Canadian government, British government, German government, etc, etc, etc. wealthy first world countries best scientists world. Ugh. Slammed. heart absolutely goes guys. high risk. keep sane making sure PPE correct going patient. hope sufficient properly-fitting PPE. I’m boat sleep—waking anxious hours able get back sleep. I’m sorry wish could make right everyone pushed brink. keep thoughts! that.

Absolutely will. already fence dress, we're she'll ask someone else too. sister closest friends tell think. 

I'll rather guy got mildly inconvenienced wardrobe change home, someone stones save embarrassment later.

Also much prefer clothes look good her, crazy innit. True that. Go ahead make mandatory also make sure pay employees vaccination rights us want infected someone unvaccinated? debate allways rights unvaccinated? I'm disagreeing that. I'm trying say basically part document, despite technically amendment. debate Americans love freedoms infect kill others definitely feel need drink seeing anything OANN.

Car guy here.

Please ignore that. Cars heated running engine coolant tiny radiator dash, blowing air heat it. heat stopped working means coolant leak somewhere, could cause engine overheating, expensive engine repair bill.

It could also blend door issue electronic air blending knobs. Unless mean air blowing, means blower motor out, also sucks, engine related.

But seriously, HVAC blowing cold heat, hear clicking/popping noise dash switching cold/hot, nip shit bud bigger issues. people care wear masks types leave leftovers. well intended might be, partial interference plans getting vaccine vulnerable first.

If lie, cal lies factual counter arguments proving lie. Otherwise saying “they lie” cancelling disagree fascistic. Pretty sure Mongolians allow Chinese political prisoner camps country. women call guy tell shoot somebody it? can't say I'm surprised wow humanity garbage publish book garbage, I'm censoring you. publish book racist garbage, mean I've suddenly started censoring you.

Social media lunatics posing they’re medical experts outright dangerous. people want spout crap don’t mind, long it’s clearly labelled area need explain aren’t licensed anything say factually backed opinion.

I agree it’s fine others share contrary views things, needs clear people discussing things snake oil pedlars preying dim witted. Yeah stay dry-ice two weeks right handling 3-4 days fridge (it needs defrost anyway) there's ample time cases, prepared like mentioned.  ""official"" Catholicism (Byzantine/Eastern orthodox) piss non-Catholics, pope anti-Catholic representative Catholicism meant Healthcare workers immune-compromised get vaccine first. small single woman real support here, understand saying, I'm also afraid cops. I've roughed cops. trust cops. Especially lot cops town related lot property owners. think right number points, totally get hesitation given cops penchant shooting first asking questions later people view property rights human beings. kind people would gather shopping event even ignoring corona defiance losers general understanding TYT partially funded Qatar also funds Al Jazeera.

I agree though TYT OANN appear roughly size. tried live life judge anyone based look. admit living life ended Pandemic. store big signs saying masks mandatory wearing mask, judging you. friend wearing mask, I'm still friend damn idiot. really simple. One great things thing go triggered 40% people brain screaming IDIOTS at. course said, say anything anyone cause would yell put risk exhaling breath me. 

I truly lost lot faith mankind year. understand individual really smart things, society, deserve top food chain. Interesting got voted one actually pointed anything specific out.

Lol... need work hard, people know tactics. seems follow post anything related Corona Virus defending China. 🤣😂 helpful. 

TLDR:

Covid cured Turkey awkward family dynamics causing numbers plummet sharply. Likewise, numbers appear spike holiday, primarily catch-up under-reporting thanksgiving weekend days follow it. likely result covid, attacks sorts shit body aside obvious part, lungs. say don’t exercise afterwards cause organs might fucked. Almost. comes breath fresh air sometimes because, born greatly lapsed Catholic, I’ve come expect “official” Catholicism say something piss literally time begin give benefit doubt anything. He’s far perfect eyes, fact often says things don’t hate nice, although fair amount traditionalists can’t stand exactly reason. Wow Idaho bite Utah. expect see that. People gonna anyway... It’s Thanksgiving cryin loud That’s virus works. probably aren’t going die first, probably won’t die all, they’ll certainly contribute spread inevitably kill someone. course i'm aware that. China runs Communist ""reeducation"" camps Mongolia much Chinese Northwest. like U.S. Guantanamo Bay various prison camps countries. Australia implemented severe lockdown used tracking app too. think would call Australia authoritarian, right? fam lives want fly Thanksgiving. Get fucked. insane. Yeah said two words didn’t give context relates virus. wrongly conclude people stopped spending government took measures all. You’re wrong. Smart people look science regardless government action inaction decide it’s risky get spend money. It’s “lockdowns” it’s government inaction. You’re wrong. amongst antivaxxers. They're going viral reservoir, rest us going get shot every months. think ship liquid nitrogen dewars (essentially highly engineered thermos). can't imagine equipment needed truck -80 degree freezer. Terrorists strolling Cleveland scoping targets: “Shit boss, we’re late. Someone already beat us it. Maybe try Pittsburgh?” Understand. self defense case.  sortof. Americans large physically spiritually weakened affluence. They’re basically children mentally. almost sense history community corroded away twin advent neoliberalism 80s internet 00s  Security cameras??  Oh man, forgot guys. They're worst lot!!! think lot governors realize point really can't anything without stimulus package seems coming. I'd imagine hospitals start filling up, probably choice. Yes guess hospitals filled dropping like flies cuz treatment them. lifetime would safer.  wonder get attention, come troubled families? vocal bunch creeps, looking stir people. people like contrary. Onion News Network? Wait OANN banned week trying kill people Belle Delphine permabanned video less explicit WAP?

Youtube fuck best way counter bad ideas good ideas, censorship. Oh, people would happily kill wearing mask also intellectually consistent they'll actually kill outright also? get depressed reading stuff like this. US fallen much many ways. told fibro head years. sister biggest go-getter I've ever met life, point obnoxious shit, fibro goes devastating flare-ups. 

I think know enough disease tell people mental. knows, may mental experience COVID often horrifyingly traumatic. even benefit knowing live it. Mental illness devastating right, certainly get ""really pushing yourself""

But neither qualified make diagnosis even suggest internet, personally feel many unknowns doctors making it, either. local stores order online option bring groceries car. might highly recommend it. I've grocery store maybe 3 times last 4 months.

e: local store City Market owned Kroger (Smith's, King Soopers, Dillons, etc.) already planning ship FDA even EUAs it. soon FDA EUAs vaccinate spot. That's cool. crazy stories wild parties? ""Eventually book publishers refuse publish things want read! That's publish propaganda too!!!!"" I’m sure feel supporting conspiracy culture either comparing numbers. 2017 flu killed 185 people 21. Covid killed 150 I’m glad still us too. Hang there, better days coming. 7th grade, specifically remember laughing adults thinking town 4K people bumfuck Indiana next pentagon got hit. 

School shooting? Unlikely, Plausible. Hijacked plane flown shitty little propane depot? Please... would spread rapidly Thanksgiving comes becomes 10 20F degrees high December/January? might seem slowing see lasting long..at all

But ya 40% definitely still extremely horrible moment. know probably mean much 

That means lot. might sound pathetic strange formed many friendships Reddit. website actually made better person. charitable now. try help people however can. Even donate 10% weekly income school's food pantry. gone bad times (worse this) site helped get it. 

Thank you. Here’s direct link video Dr Kenneth “backdoor evicted” call lease came renewal April landlord said would renew lease

People getting fucked asshole landlord nowhere go look squatting. Tenants way, way rights anyone thinks, basically believe lease last X number months years, case, becomes judge decide. Law enforcement absolutely touch squatter insisting there's lease, without court order, except states like Nevada. 5th subcamp Texas: don’t get it, get ill, recover mild case continue spout bullshit. know getting downvoted. People wearing masks pulling talk phone going change mask perspective. enrage them, causing spray even droplets. puts &amp; possibly others serious risk attacked killed. 

You never able prove point (even though 100% right) incapable seeing side. 

Best steer clear. nope fuck away droplets. also curse mind b/c jfk frustrating live world selfish idiots. He's got good interviewer skills never interesting thing podcast, gets guests place (usually) lets talk (for better worse) makes interesting. Joe flawed creature. Died with* ""at something like 350k"" complete speculation. many refusing get medical attention all. family friend nurse personally witnessed non tested person die hospital get marked covid death. Can't say credible statement really is, many already doubting got even 250k. Claiming there's 100k deaths reported, without evidence, going seed doubt types Americans. go around making baseless claims. Overshoot collapse boys, overshoot collapse wait till Christmas. related. willing followed guidelines. Nobody forced us to. protest rights wear mask. send death threats doctors. simply better society. Mirror anyone please often highest, always. better eating takeout via webcam? feel right now... like key peel episode... 

Is good...?? trying say pope woke  sorry made day lmao  People type attitude long talk vaccine man, don’t give shit massively so. back evidence lasts 6 months. could possibly known yet?  Reddit full shut-ins think they’re introverts. Seasonal mean stops summer... spreads slower abundantly clear watching hit warm weather climates, spreading anywhere like March /April cool weather spread. think there's flu tropics? also abundantly clear seasonal stopped ravaging Sweden heated without much social distancing. even take down....it's can't post week.,.. demonetized hurt enough. content taken we're using word ', suspended' China closes schools first whenever there's signs community spread. 

Why? Kids spread develop symptoms. even test positive despite corona. Also people love kids. can't quarantine kids seperately. Nice source, OP. Fine dust?  got downvoted? much want see anti-maskers gone, risked possibly life. funeral miraculous chance guy even bigger asshole seemed! unknown pathogen confirmed Nov. 2019. reported US notified. That's thinking. aggressively spreads, really considering household rather individuals. member household COVID, chances good (bad) rest too. Ha, exact opposite, despite Swine Flu Bird Flu, heard British PM say ""Herd Immunity"" plan thought ""oh shit we're fucked, there's way Trump anything there's phrase allows not"". Back March telling friends family total deaths tabulated (excess whatnot) we'd 1 million (but barely). ""You mean infected?"" ""No dead."" 

I'm thinking napkin math may bit low, though. basically 350mil people, 18mo vax (without mitigation get it, even probably still do) , 3% dead (however people test positive die probably high), @ 1% would 3.5 mil, let's say local government reduce significant margin, ehh we're 1 mil. Nice round number. thought back March, obviously napkin math real model. early warning shot. ready. state, shoot him. Meanwhile family angry go Thanksgiving, think hate them. reality, love know I'd rather upset dead. government thank that. Wtf? That’s nonsensical metric something like this. personally think rolled equally everywhere much possible given inherent logistical infrastructure differences places, approach someone Texas Florida hasn’t taken shit seriously (not saying everyone hasn’t blanket statement) one first access vaccine someone like Massachusetts Vermont overall done much better job taking seriously simply significantly smaller amount land people live on? It’s even biased way makes sense administration since places like California high priority. Good know. Thank course people would trust source. website internet all! /s Right. 
The risk great. stand think right, takes one punch kill seriously maim you.
You could die get seriously injured even pushed over. 
This talking guns knives. 
Perhaps deep breaths, reflect on:
1. wearing mask, risks
to greatly reduced.
2. training skills de-escalating situations, calming people down?
3. self-defense expert? rate fastest draw? / do, think long would feel kill injure someone self-defense. (It feel good).
4. Maybe right, try help ways? Perhaps let store manager know? talk friends it? could petition local government police more.

I've gotten fair share arguments years. I've never convinced anyone change behavior, I've always felt worse afterwards. right not, time place debate, many people take challenge attack person. triggers self-righteous anger, never know unstable person is. 
Breathe, shake head maybe, live enjoy another day. I'm sure real physical specimen. Months? I'm going wear mask soon weather starts dropping Covid over. 

&amp;#x200B;

I mean kinda aim like Japan majority people wear masks regardless year. Cuomo's fault! ordered COVID patients sent nursing homes! Now, spread country! Thanks, Obama! True. good teachers... good schools. definitely over-generalized. 

I think covid-19 expose bad ones... parents see hear. Masks forever lol Another American patriot could care less 300k people dying. people multimillion strong 5th column virus. Jfc Well lot people consider “authoritarian” politely asked wear mask so... Seriously lol. I’m surprised don’t miss regular life, never got partake would keep mask around case I'm sick can't stay home even pandemic over. (and suspect many others) mandating masks threat Covid greatly subsided whether vaccination (ideally) otherwise.

People rest lives choose wear masks reason anywhere go public bother all. That's matter personal choice. blanket mask mandates people regardless whether sick threat Covid diminished time (and believe someone pushing another thread), sit well me. bakery sell product anyone matter what, even offensive/agressive customers, serve them, you’re allowed refuse business anyone? dumb. truthful. actually happened. Censorship shit. Fucking idiots “freedom”. 

Is really hard government tells shut mouth? They’ve never done us wrong never will. It’s weird lol week? peddling snake oil DYING PEOPLE? read somewhere ironically second wave gave data needed speed research results. Human right violations. Right, mean tens of.thousands dead America? Could point stupid? hear you’re saying sound like spoiled, entitled brat. Freedom also requires sacrifice. right now, means looking past selfish, meaningless, consumer-driven existence one second thinking community. 

Personal freedom. eat Cheesecake Factory, buy cheap Chinese imports, go megachurch run charlatan. hope never need hospital time. no, don’t think COVID diagnosis means ticket ICU. broken bone, car accident, avocado injuries—you might surprised turn away, due capacity reached. maybe you’ll rethink definition personal freedom. 300k+ plus excess deaths datapoint? Let guess, believe datapoint real? bakery sell product anyone matter what, even offensive/agressive customers, serve them, you’re allowed refuse business anyone? I'm wearing one public rest life. could make regular flu seasons less deadly. Plus, going keep pandemic level viruses climate change gets fiercer. one survive without job? work thing sucks. think controversy there's little honesty leaders. Everyone knows schools first thing close really aim stop transmission. School free daycare. Without it, millions parents able work (and remember complaints able work home junior around first lockdown). Schools open economic - wrong. It'd huge economic hit... honest.  think COVID glossed largely ignored history books 50 years now. doubt Spanish Influenza gets paragraph modern high school history textbook. response COVID national embarrassment, always easier try forget embarrassments dwell learn them. think risk assessment going people either end spectrum beliefs also people middle. seem person one end spectrum. think end yourself.

The people middle, fence sitters-so speak, might want reason feel comfortable becoming lax. might Bend social pressure generally, risk aversion effortful, difficult tiring. people begin relax worse situation gets. people get covid riskier things become, spreading becomes easier exponential growth gets control. they're orange... Keep up! Obvious, since 3 years talking ""Russian traitor"" ""walls closing in"" narrative disappears overnight media doesn’t happen. US could back normal enjoying concerts now, going NBA games, kids could back school without masks, everything could before. no, people can’t even wear masks without putting fuss first place. definitely good ones. Really... mostly teacher IMO.

If good public schools area would use them.  Stonks go Notice says ""death rate"" death count. basically saying people infected still die percentile locked not. play words, meant mislead you. May well them. got results 2-3 days tho! really like phrase herd immunity mostly spread around COVID 19 news.

Natural herd immunity useless.

Vaccine induced herd immunity vital, like flu shots. wife's bottling plant nurse practitioner working site full time clinic. goes flu shots prescriptions. insurance involved. pretty sweet. benefit exists open discourse.

This garbage argument. argument that, true, would apply publishers well. bullshit claim I've arguing whole time. 

A publisher says ""I publish hateful Nazi drivel."" harming discourse. find CNN MSNBC propagandists, don’t advocate deplatforming them.

This reasonable argument either!!! I'm saying propagandists able use internet. I'm saying Youtube ought disallow using service. I'm saying Nazis disallowed writing, owning printing presses binding books either. *am* saying reasonable book publishers ought publish Nazis' books. example, I'm saying CNN able TV channel... I'm saying CNN allow Goebbels airtime channel. 

Your whole line reasoning long string mental hoops jump order justify propaganda. Ohio here. news, sky blue paid taxes. prove so-called shady dealing? logic? wee emote frog big eyes twitch that's express fear / apprehension — sorry used without context aha !
You birthmark ?? That's crazy man, 664, must like birth bro neighbors something ! ;) sure become crystal clear America whole giant asshole. way many selfish pricks roaming around. biggest irony scumbags ones “Back Blue” punisher stickers trucks claim it’s Patriotism. Hypocrites. Liars. Assholes. need find one infected person reported prove China lying.

Yet one able that. power law compel persuasive. engage reckless behavior, maybe time lucky, general habitual thing. die first auto accident lung cancer carbon monoxide poisoning passed drunk trailer. feel like shit average anyway. Bring it. remember telling friend mine, back March, ""Man, getting real bad Italy, luckily since happened first, taken care summertime."" BOY WRONG Costco must worst, regularly let people mask. asked person front said “I’m police, want it?” arent state people risk? 100% agree. country founded idea giving government middle finger. Karma comment well deserved Oann garbage moderation. publisher. updated enough you? Tell 200,000 dead people celebrating year. Karma comment well deserved. true even Covid need emphasize staying more. Wearing masks good need go out, really need people stop gathering . mask reduces infections, eliminates them. Really? Oh shirt Look end day, aweful lot Catholics world - significant number wearing masks. quote head guy get Catholic anti-maskers donning masks I'll take it. practical. It’s crash small businesses give power big corporations I'm sorry, charge felonious assault? premeditated attempted murder? thing guy got shot wants shooter lose right weapon? NEVER MOVING KENTUCKY Haha, I’ve strep cold. Bad luck guess. Seriously. worst part end sight things get worse least 1 month. expecting lot numbers due Thanksgiving 150,000+ cases day November. believe 25% US cases came November... feel horrible medical staff work times. way describe experiencing feel 1 2 years over. 1.5% cases

200k today means 3k deaths tomorrow said.. many dont' mental capabilities understand two sentences press downvote button thinking I'm antivaxxer. said stupid rule vaccine widely available, say anything contradictions cautions. Jesus, sub cancer. public schools need alot work, gonna lie that, wholesale junk Hmmm... like 3rd study say this...

Ahh yes, nothing like making shit. Who's denying what? would interested see that. Thanks civil discussion, rate. 

I seen anyone comparing anything 1918 save fact horrible pandemic. knowledge treatments incredibly advanced compared then. better split doses? Two people 70% protected better one person 95% protected. good article needs like it. people going take risks matter loudly tell to. makes sense educate public managing minimizing risks. Maybe it’s extent would go, I’d rather see someone taking basic precautions simply tuning going way take risks. wary guidelines coming late. Yet another reason damn paranoid covid. can't imagine havoc would cause considering already deal TBI. 0.6 0.8% death rate states, math really lie I'm neg repped hell. let's pragmatic here. 

You would rather starve go food banks, live car shelter possibly raped stuff gets stolen. Possibly get sick covid19 anyway hospital even broke thing. work places like walmart infected walk around everyday guaranteed ppe. mention ever increasing student debt too. middle winter? Rather take risk earn 8k week?

I'm saying ok. earning 8k week possibly trauma work $800 week deal covid patients anyway 10 weeks 8k instead 80k?

I know logical thing is. Please don’t ask check themselves. nuisance already strained medical community. would write his/her name, date, time. call corporate HQ file complaint. Let deal cuz corporate policy didn't, shame social media. stop really fast. disinfect pig heads, either disinfection method (probably UV) effective there's hole disinfection and/or pre-disinfection safety precautions. Thanks link. ...no words...

should brought...a JAG attorney great need anything specific.

""I want 1 lb bacon deli, substitute""

""Substitute 3 lbs prepackaged ham, got it!"" think people 70+ year old family members mean that. well could last Thanksgiving non-covid reasons. could last Thanksgiving people battling cancers, dementia, etc. think people saying think covid kill entire population. Every vaccine gone three stages clinical trials, designed specifically catch side effects. side effect, would limited best. wearing mask everytime step house. claim weak. someone said, contamination public space minimal compare gathering indoor ""friends families"". wearing masks want protect works essential places. nice person caring put danger support us. welcome. hope researchers find effective treatments cures soon. also hope stimulates research help others similar effects infections like lingering lyme people POTS various viral infections.

Sadly Covid19 researchers around world spoiled choice comes possible research subjects :(  thought funerals stopped COVID-19  Yeah, numbers referring to, trying use something easier 1:1269. around 5th 6th Europe, since gone way done multiple countries peaked hard fall. However, compared neighbors, equivalent countries, Sweden still far, far worse. According California Restaurant Assn., restaurants operate safely industries pandemic, 

That true all. Restaurants three actions known significantly increase chances catching covid infected person. One, can't eat drink wearing mask. mask come significant amount time. Two, likely near others long periods also masks down. longer exposed someone covid likely contract it. Third, restaurant atmosphere normally lot conversation, sometimes loudly, sometimes laughing. Loud talking, yelling, laughing, etc tend send viral particles little normal conversation. 

None issues present store setting. Mask times, time around another person household limited minutes checkout, people wont talking loudly/yelling. 

Some people think 6 feet away sort magic number like virus hits 6 ft 1/32 inch immediately vaporizes falls floor. 

The concerning thing seen pandemic weird justification profits come people's lives. income comes health. feel people struggling say chose income predicament electing people NOTHING help you. shows need pick better leaders, ones lead playing partisan mind games. Lesser evils comes Canadian politics can't forcibly vaccinate anti-vaxxers? understand sentiment generally agree, there’s difference one individual lunatic something crazy horrible someone said thousands orchestrated people destroying property people businesses 100% unrelated issue, name movement (even one). Simply need read article headline ;)

Friendly reminder reddit barely better YouTube fox CNN comments good article. point back napkin figures timelines. wish went one level deeper level 2 spread probably hundreds thousands get Covid spread next 5-14+ days context with. real growth begins Thanksgiving, top growth now... time time Christmas. Oh wonderful. actually both. real concerns long term effects loss education. cared free daycare care whether high schools person. that's works feel awful people taking precautions still get COVID, go hospital emergency pandemic.

I think lot me, personally.

On one hand... want COVID take precautions. riskiest thing go gym, 100% wear mask, keep touching face, wash hands disinfect phone soon I'm done. test regularly gym home grocery store. That's it.

On hand... get COVID I'd want get now. region still 20% ICU bed availability, although positivity rate crept 15% slow. happened get COVID able get whatever medical attention need. things continue get worse knows would happen got mid Jan (for instance).

On plus side I'm IL governor taken scientific data driven approach. Cases started go implemented restrictions things trending slowly downward. I'm anxious though mid Dec mid Jan look like, two weeks holidays. I’ll real don’t either. I’ll try find 2018 flu data you. let’s honest I’ve seen types kinds reasons compare 1918. last time worse masks. people killed asked wear masks though, one. point still stands. Wtf... life mean anything people? mentally unstable something heinous? Ford GM basically health care companies happen make cars. employees best health coverage world. insurance companies claim pre existing condion know sure know causing permanent damage.  Either Russian bot butt hurt Trumpster. Sorry orange potato lost honey. talking people flying California pandemic. arent likely paycheck paycheck cases. state unpopulated, would think stopping spread covid would easy least guess not. like NYC. agree pushed hit back head shelf something permanent damage. Last 30 minutes bro . smart family :) ! Assault charges? Thanks America could shooting someone lethal weapon assault. attempted murder clearly! someone else line fire god forbid child?

All someone asking another person due civic duty put others risk lethal virus. Ffs teacher. Please go actual teacher questions.  Sweden never anti-herd immunity policy either. Oh Im soooo sorry want enjoy Disneyland without mask, fuckton happy people around me, packed onto Main Street like sardines waiting fireworks. wear mask post-vaccine distribution protect denying diseased pieces filth isnt going fly. behooves us cautions novel infectious agent. Novel tacked onto giggles, means new know do.

I want guinea pig finding particular biology vulnerable long term problem much less death. enjoy even common cold alone would happy wear mask even without risk however small serious effects passing someone else. wonder many times happened US. ugh  know details health plan please educate happened east asia then? guess ignore half world, yeah half-assed ""lockdowns"" whole lot. lockdowns, contact tracing, masks work, countries 1% deaths west seeing. South Korea basically island. peninsula, who’s land border shut completely. problem reality screwing people process.  Tuesday passed bipartisan coronavirus relief bill deliver one-time $1,200 check types unemployed workers $50,000 certain businesses. 

A lot good stuff bill addition stimulus checks. Good New Mexico!

Now please love god follow suit federal level? mean [this one [walked maskless Rome first pray end pandemic, things...

I'm glad seems changed mind he's wearing mask, I'm criticizing **people** continue protest (after almost year **situation**, crazy see people still believing reality things), let's praise months **inappropriate** behavior.

**\*Edited first comment deleted.**  worried residual effects catching covid symptoms honesty Yeah would've awful. really idea viral infections back (the article points out), treatment poor influenza absolutely ran rife.

I still think would long time (with medical knowledge now) since 1 5 hospital beds used one virus - although idea look up. 

I find amazing comparing today's situation one literally century ago - assume make point covid's big deal? Well supposed 'gone April' 'with tha heeaaaat'. sure happen... DICKS, like it. Figures pathetic redditors would downvote AMA, lol. Uff headline depressing af sure makes sense. Burn. Multiplied millions people ends 260,000 dead counting, assuming chance dying fairly low. Completely? No. pretty damn good? Yeah. South Korea 50 million people, less 500 deaths. cases also must pretty low. test well, resist contact tracing, mask social distance properly. fact, even really shut anything system populace worked really well understood science. I'm poor af can't afford Costco membership. :( I’m basic shop sams club, like blue moon. also this? ""Lol"" really hurts read. way talk dead!! rumor it, Costco treat employees like shit pays fair wages. almost feel guilty leeching GF's mom's card.

Hey, next time y'all back costco see white standup forklifts. Crowns. used sell Costco. They're best electric lift trucks market. Costco spends money good, safe equipment. might, fact, correct, point. leader demonstrating leadership, trotting (probable) get jail free card front staff public. Lead example, damnit. really hard do. stage yes, lifted restrictions early cases built quickly potentially no. could easily escalate six week one didn’t get fast enough. 

Either way, we’re really good place considering shit-show USA I’m happy minor restrictions keep everyone safe. Nothing stopping pretty much anything moment. ""but saw Thanksgiving, fiiiiine""

deal it.

&amp;#x200B;

After Big Thanksgiving Dinners, Plan Small Christmas Funerals, Health Experts cost vaccine Russian bot farm from? Y'all bit problem hear. choice go out. Also, nobody said Covid isnt serious Cool, don’t *need* money wouldn’t still nice receive another check 1200 stimulate economy instead handing money directly company CEOs?  safer guys living bubble, unless literally never go out, except house same, bubble. honesty safer still risky. it. Especially right now. summer, cases better control one thing. there's way many cases think ""just one time safe chill."" That's takes 1 time. employees tell this, go back store again. list places go short though... Yeah, he's asshole months!! times complain superior, may even curse him!

&amp;#x200B;

But also times admit trying make whole company work better, benefiting way.

&amp;#x200B;

In China, government like superior evil empire ""tries brainwash"" ""you point problem die"" ...... Oh man that's crazy, good thing many Americans escaping local strains thanksgiving flying another state /s cases identified fact. time pneumonia. Many countries countries even honestly go records try identify first cases. live take care 80 year old father. live farm, helping video conference family. sisters think turning away them, ""antivax morons"". Luckily Dad still witty shuts down. continually amazed stupidity people looked to. Sigh, hang there, stay safe sane can.  hospitals country space.

It's unfortunate one's told you, already  Definitely public schools bad. went pretty good one, wife plenty friends. know terrible general area, definitely good ones there. takes ~ 20-25 minutes take warm soda beer cool refreshing chill -80° C freezer. FYI. Even Trump America still going laughingstock purely based sort shitty behaviour That's relatively stable patients experience. uncommon, unstable patient is, likely awake intubated. 

The problem covid oxygen levels already boots put sleep plummet minute takes intubate. less sedative tends given, less time allowed work putting tube.

A previous intensivist boss (half-joking) recipe intubating unstable patients: ""100 thio, 100 sux 100 apologies still aware intubate you"" thread saying city hospitals turn patients rural areas. Pretty disgusting. asked wear mask considered ""Communism"" even would help hide identity authorities. want people afraid vaccine amount people aren’t flying 16M (50% last year). total number people traveled 50 miles 55M. That’s already 30% drop. 

It’s also 5% total population

So noticeably larger percentage people would driving year make that, “10% less year” number true. 

Therefore, due simple math, believe number bunk Literally cannot catch fake virus? learning difficulties? strategy methods rest europe ended big community spread; I.E. flatten curve, WFH, limit risks infection etc. 
If benefitted anything, voluntary-based approach. would take shirt see goes honestly. Thats suing assault works, ok. lift eviction ban landlords manage risk. Yeah, totally agree, ""different"" mean Chinese people hell bend following footstep ""western civilization"" considering ""democracy"" urgent must-have. mean like ways policies enforced Chinese people.
I fed demonization entire country without trying understand situation. perfect solution, trade-offs, even problems within China, believe guys trying get best it. Cheers! They've trained looked others enemy, subhuman. believe come decent shape, sure. don’t think time claim victory though. 90k death scenario wasn’t realistic even back then. hopeful prognostic indicator underdeath experienced throughout Q3 regions even throughout year. bad thing current wave Christmas coming, although doesn’t seem specific us. can't ramp production vaccines? There's enough doses coming months based read. What's limiting factor? vaccine available, no, it’s anti vax. I’m also skeptical speed development vaccines Early someone told thing essential worker, essential job. It’s heart breaking. 20 French Laundry $15k?

Must lightweight, cheap drunks crew. seen much hey talking someone Florida, feel you. rural state neccesarily definitely one least irresponsible states i've felt completely isolated thoughts fellow Floridians. doctors think addition narcolepsy Hypersomnia. actually one reason afraid catching Covid heart already works hard. 

What technically currently inappropriate sinus tachycardia also dysautonomic symptoms. I'm generally healthy 25 year old male heart rate would 100 waking day day. used get light headed faint showers finally buying smart watch heart monitor found pulse would hit high 170-180 taking shower. 

I spent years thinking weak mild exercise could end balled corner trying vomit pass out. 

There medicine that's helped ton, really bad symptoms pretty manageable. people long road back anything resembling normalcy. 

I know takes make people care anymore honestly. life career pretty much totally upended chronic sleep disorder that's disabling could gotten something simple flu strep throat. I've shared info lots friends would know like something simple change life. got lots sympathetic responses saw many (not all) people continued go life little precaution. guess truly denial anything sort happen them. anti-masker dumb. potential benefits country, individual, wearing mask huge, close zero downside COVID taught truly selfish genuinely awful people One thing I'm learning conservatism imply caution. means intense desire things stay stay same. people grew China, remember complaining government overreach.

Well go ranting hours. guess what? 90% China news NYT CNN WSJ crap(such reports Xinjiang HK ), either heavily twisted perspective outright lies. real issues 99% Chinese care never mentioned, censorship films Games, stupid Great Firewall, Capitalists way overriding labor laws, unfair education system favored rich live mega cities, etc. 

If Chinese living Mainland read western media everyday, crystal clear report limited twisted Chinese stories fit certain narrative , showing ZERO interest engage Chinese people really cares , pain Chinese people suffering. such, audience west never presented ""real"" picture life China is. Deaths, hospitalizations ICU admission peaked mid April - least two months summer vacation. Summer surely helped sped decline, declining time then.

I would say main reason decline people better adhering recommendations back spring, fall gone back normal. I’m sick people pointing virus usually kills old people, like makes less problem good time there. Randomly walked street party/fair really happening. Checked Rock Roll Hall Fame. seem like real dickhead. want part flatten curve straight acting like you’re people waiting tables whole lives. everyone built same. compassion struggling feed families.

What's going thread? Look downvoted comments. biggest question coronavirus is. start mass vaccinating going prevent people giving people coronavirus going get vaccine. 

Some going coronavirus know. 

So end virus vaccine effective spread shot becomes effective. 

I noticed smoke big cloud comes mask instance next line walks right step forward step was. film really sped development vaccine, too. competency, current administration listened experts, especially Fauci, put teeth plan would've much better. comments ""don't send vaccine states believe it"" ""rural states getting deserve"" ect.

wears little thin 🥴 phenomenon isn’t unique COVID-19. Post viral illness known phenomenon.

No message intended offering fact. Beat lady. tired people. 

It's hard wear mask. Mask kind. Peace. slap wrist light slap. read earlier today synagogue NYC held wedding grand rabbi's son grandson packed 7000 capacity venue. actively tried sneak wedding without caught. social distancing places worship allowed 50% capacity masks anyone. Got slapped $15000 fine $5 every person over. wont even pay cover crappy club. $250 fine every person over. would $750k money went doctors nurses going forced take care resulting outbreak. Mongolia country hostile China... Wait lol context? get better 99.6%? Facebook tells 99.6%. Even though official numbers say 98% official estimate asymptomatic would make slightly 99%, facebook tells 99.6%, that's I'll believe. Also, long haulers fake news government never let us lockdown. see dead people would accommodated, like people legitimately cannot wear mask. small number. Astra Zeneca vaccine shown effective elderly, many vaccines recommended over-65s, like flu. Flu vaccine also among vaccines recommended immunocompromised patients, likely covid-19 vaccines join them. 'health reasons' mind? rate go sharply medical facilities overwhelmed. that's indeed 'if' 'when'. isnt - since corruption rampant Russia really cant trust ANYTHING truly seems.

It design. 

So glad Russians free vaccine. 

I less happy vaccine wasn’t necessarily tested safety standard, peer reviewed way. fREdom issue shots work. need frown yet. happy spotify triangle day I've become huge instacart fan. Yeah, weekly groceries might end costing $150 rather $135 went store myself. worth though. Obviously I'm lucky able afford it. Many, many women delusion violence 'empowering'. Almost none ever experienced it. Civilization verge collapse, I'm deadly serious. Yea armed guards normally paid much higher. unarmed sitting parking lot job call police, probably getting $7.25. average mall walmart security guard overnight. Nobody freaks seatbelt laws... think restaurant makes money of? 4 people appetizers, drinks dessert along 20% gratuity waitstaff one guy ordering entree thru postmates takes percentage money order? saying I’m come man don’t act like restaurants make anywhere near profits takeout delivery. Free testing going away game over. 

We world shit. way Mitch asshole approve anything, let alone extension free testing funds. Jesus. agree. Haven’t found COVID jokes funny months. I’m trying describe feeling ... think it’s existential indifference. 

I’m investing solo backpacking gear seasons planning spend time wild, one expects anything me, expect nothing anyone else. amount raw need everywhere look overwhelming. first, excited physician eager volunteer “war effort”, people started inviting enemy inside, aiding promoting even. feel like I’m trying help lot people didn’t care enough help themselves, it’s rubbing off. 

I park ranger.  Minnesotans come go maskless everywhere. bars restaurants *packed* border towns MN closed. Really though, that’s fucking Minnesota too, hell closed whole economy people coming border Wisconsin shit...what’s point even locking point? Christ, he's insufferable meathead. sounds like precaution prevent germ spread. probably drink water disposable cups alternative would’ve almost PPE front-line workers.

Sure, general population shortage absolutely way healthcare workers would’ve able scrap by.

Your assumption incorrect fact shortage average citizen couldn’t significantly worse.  days hate state. exactly. try order fall depression. pepper spray enrages people. form violence itself. America looking pretty scary lately outside... goddamned shame. One way another, society paying future failures right now. back June. Don’t! afraid go hospital need to. Take care yourself. Nope true all, single respiratory disease prevent wearing mask...I take care people time end life copd wear masks. argument complete bullshit. ohio dangerous yall Except woman stood store shot outside store story. 'anti-maskers' crazy. Everyone thinks don‘t virus, that’s 50%+ transmissions asymptomatic. Welcome wonderful world state inspections. Oh, god. 4 years Malignant Narcissist bad enough. need shifty idiot Oval Office. cannot even imagine. honestly get angry customers freak employees enforcing mask rule . Corporate refuses hire anyone enforce it. I've gotten screamed , worth it.  employees' lives worth this. life worth this. We've already call police customer threatened one checkers going get gun car asked mask. That's one like three we've banned recently reason . easy feel righteous blame people somebody know line. happens entire population embraces masks, social distancing, staying home. would welcome things made permanent even COVID longer threat. australia cost much? experience go drive clinic 100% free (i vic though might influence experience) 7 cases imported overseas today.

As Yesterday, 37 cases remain hospital 1 placed intensive care unit. total 28 people passed away due COVID-19. total 58,079 patients fully recovered.

As 23 Nov, 4,448,110 swab tests conducted. 741,700 swab tests per 1,000,000 total population performed. 1,188,324 unique patients swabbed.

Covid-19 PCR tests made available general public 600 locations starting 01 Dec. I've worked nurse LTC dealt state inspectors. lot blanket regulations enforced thought actual impact individual scenarios. can't even bottled drinks nurses station. Heaven help inspector catches taking sip water. Nope. Long term stay home mandates dont work point almost everyone living city wearing mask. go shopping see someone without mask, it’s like flashing light sign “DANGER, CRAZY VIOLENT PERSON”. point anyone wearing mask clearly insane talking probably going result violence. Hell, bet don’t wear mask purpose hoping get confronted start fight. don’t want give satisfaction. glare safe distance away hope police officer called store employees. That’s say. 

To perfectly honest hard time believing Groceries, prescriptions, living apartment shared ventilation?

Even people stay home interaction outside world, people eat know.

Or work essential jobs can’t stay home need money eat pay rent.

If everyone took seriously they’d fine, no, dumb selfish fucks can’t put mask party without sobbing “fReEDom!!11!!” Hopefully Bandai Nancy follow wife loved working home lockdown doesn’t want return office full time setup nice home office her. doesn’t mind going much productive without constant desk side interruptions, two hour long lunch breaks pulled meetings doesn’t need in. also finds easier manage team team productive working home pushing return office mindset much possible. OANN, Fox pander enough liking passed New Jersey numbers hit mid April. Worth noting new jersey already pretty tight lockdown orders nearly month death rate peaked began fall. indication South Dakota anywhere near peak. new infections come little last days might sustained. Even new infections peaked deaths coming already baked in. bucket go far bud. fact lied timing made worse.
As can/bucket, say bucket emphasize scale something, kick road little thing, bucket (or say barrel) big thing. You’ve done math. 
It doesn’t work. 
With temps downward trend, many places cannot really even field hospitals. 
There mass amount demand medical treatment clear lack supply medical professionals give it. 
Not shutting country hard winter seen worst mistake pandemic future history books, fear. government, maybe. think dire enough situations it’s reasonable. mean goodness sake literally
Had draft before. forcing people die war. Getting vaccine 100x less dangerous unethical. Private companies able mandate. Gyms restaurants closed month now. Even better, headline mention country is, antis assume America, actually Canada Europe whatever there's convincing shitty things happen too. Next thing know, going mandatory french kissing strangers.  Ok, thanks. Yes, EUA granted, available distribution. authorize emergency use vaccine, vaccine undergone different standard authorization (a lower bar efficacy safety) vaccine available commercially. levels Xmas

Where we're going fly around country mix households again! Goodie! everyone quarantined month went directly party would, fact, impossible get sick.

What even talking about? Coronavirus cases emerging highest numbers pandemic, 175,000 day, average, country seen cases deaths anywhere else world. 

Yep many choose ignore guidelines ""cause ain't bad"". Meanwhile health professionals screaming hospitals overflowing, understaffed exhausted 

Only 1% test positive become serious critical say current rate 1750 people day become serious critical. 50k month. 100k total ICU beds people need beds illnesses too. 

Other countries handling pandemic much better got leadership, bunch partisan drama queens playing politics. Even underdeveloped countries better us. best way honor Tradition Thanksgiving making big parties cooking sharing food praying . making large gathering burdening hospital hospital staff suffer caring people getting sick bc spreading disease. People going soon see deadly “This impact coastal cities” attitude is.  Here's trick. People going make wrong decision *going vindicated it.* get lucky avoid virus entirely. asymptomatic. get mild case. ever feel impact tell ""see, knew would fine, everything turned okay.""

Because people understand statistics, understand virus propagation, understand R0. look spiking graph think ""that sucks, *my* fault. I'm sick. sniffles couple days go outside day after.""

Millions people never know, personally, propagated virus two people. Probably two people even know. propagation spike comes from.

The main intent social distancing keep safe individual. *slow propagation*. that, unfortunately, something individual ever aware whether succeeded at. going anybody's fault. go lives, oblivious.

Happy Thanksgiving! hope excellent studies years factor fact people driving much, going less etc along complicating factors people going Drs office regular checkups etc get true Covid numbers article irrelevant. claim can;t get sick follow precautions irresponsible, ignorant, plain stupid. Mmmm ranch. False. know hospital system talking Ohio 3.4 billion revenue, profit. know one thing spread covid?  Video chat. capability amazingly widely available.


Wait virus mutate biological digital, truly screwed. then, remains option.


Just like people would rather get trampled Black Friday instead comfortably shopping home still boggles mind. dishonest, disappointed would come instead information presented. went read. want dispute presented, please provide evidence. 

But go honesty. PhD, ashamed yourself. wasn’t calling specifically, way people react events/situations say lot character.

Sorry hard year. would gotten covid stayed home?  nothing kind “great reset” conspiracy types going about.

Well conspiracy guys imagined ""Communist New World Order"" right?

And comes ""World Economic Forum"" plan enter unique window opportunity shape recovery, initiative offer insights help inform determining future state global relations, direction national economies, priorities societies, nature business models management global commons. Drawing vision vast expertise leaders engaged across Forum’s communities, Great Reset initiative set dimensions build new social contract honours dignity every human being.

I mean .. funny. certainly *sounds* bit like ""New World Order"". understand people can't see person.

A lot people need real human contact cope stress. feel need personally know people hard watch suffer.

If want everyone stay home paying monthly stipend, subsidizing everyone's internet, working mental health professionals wellness checks people living alone, offering clear, consistent leadership - basically everything ease psychological burden pandemic. 

Instead everyone getting dogpiled bullshit day day day.

Obviously conspiracy theorists beyond help I'm surprised rational people snapping visiting family too. completely predictable. 300 people died covid US, said survival rate 99.9999%. 300,000 people died, 99.9%. lot people know ""survival rate"" means. Rules thee me. 

Shocking tell Yes, ""kicked bucket road"" point vaccine imminent could actually prevent lot deaths occuring. finish line sight people choosing trip fall face rather sustain effort little bit longer. baffling.

(Also, saying ""kick road,"" although bucket may actually apt metaphor case) Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'm northeast pretty cold currently. Masks know actually adhere long.

Granted, state one better ones. 4 us none us flying anything, PROBABLY ok. really wish we'd skip altogether.

Like said wife point she'd go without me, much say. guess. Even so, don’t see much cause concern regards original sentiment discussed; significant number people ease significant manner merely know small cohort others vaccinated. Seems fear mongering anything. 

Who knows? Maybe I’m giving people much credit. Maybe I’m projecting, know personally still practice sensibility (e.g. mask wearing, distancing, small gatherings, etc.) even vaccinated, public health officials say it’s irresponsible otherwise. follow. vaccine getting immunity *without* getting virus. everyone actually gets vaccine like should, 95%+ effective vaccine, combined little community spread (due mostly immunized population) result very, low chance getting COVID post-vaccine.

I think confusing natural herd immunity numbers (70%+ actually get infected) vaccine immunity. There's reason we've working hard towards vaccine. It’s possible “take every precaution” you’re family gathering.

Actually is. could quarantined month each. that's wrong post. original claim made someone breaking rules get sick first place give everyone else, possible, even likely, inherently true. 


You get sick everything right. Go play crayons let adults talk. can't deny medical help someone disagree them? positive still shedding virus technically still active regardless long been. right here. What's best interest company? Closing sick workers? understaffed moving employees around pissing customers? employees show safe place shop? saying. HR done great job I'm weeding people giving finals. 10 days basically couple (two) weeks Could anything, knows haha 2,224 many people died hospital alone covid bw &amp; bw march - April. still mentally &amp; physically exhausted. Heart breaking experience. 
It also took financial toll.... finances still mess money spent personnel protective gear days missed work bc injury moving patient. 
I words express year like.
Terrible lives lost. 
Also horrible seeing combating disease turned political debate instead people working hard together prevent spread disease biggest travesty all. Praying better prevention Minnesota pretend exist, hope husband comes closet one days. aren’t people taking free pass avoid hanging family thanksgiving? anyone really like family?  One question - I'm curious note sources. primary sources every stage copy throughout. feel thorough enough? state mask mandate mean people listened. That's we're ffs. Yeah I’m Florida, love liberal Tampa Bay Area I’d say slight majority wear masks. Like I’d say I’d say 60% wear 40% don’t wrong. go pass rural Florida last month stop gas station 11/11 people including employees mask on. Whole different breed rural florida going take sacrificing couple thousands lives suggestion classes end winter break would pretend 10-14 days eat outside/in room wear mask shared living spaces (opening windows hepa filter good spend minutes room). testing accessible test day 8 (they start work then) wait results like humans greatest disease vector modern times reopen visitors hope come! Again, spreading misinformation

[Gov. Whitmer urges Michiganders shop urges residents shop go 27 minutes in, boom, guv promoting shop local black friday, businesses presenting her.

But, enough misinformation spreading self admit wrong, it? :) Darwin awards. shame they'll take innocent people them. serve local government answer questions state stepping in. general, local state governments pass balanced budgets (so want spend appropriate it, show revenues support it). federal government allowed deficit spend funds yet have. even though city council really wants help more, hands tied. applied CARES Act funds, received some, distributed community, beyond able much. also preempted, state, raising taxes 1% per year existing rate. that, mean go 3 4%, example. mean maxed going 3 3.03%. city level, provide services people need day day, like utilities libraries, year found costs going state assistance dwindling. precarious position, sure, would like simply can't. say quit like it?

That option use, sure. always comes much pain ass would replace vs cost giving want. Unpopular opinion: Thanksgiving leftovers taste good ventilator either. sowa panas Recall unfortunately, yup. yourself. far comparing treatment group vs test group, even though initial intent; one group (in case treatment group) gets altered test vs control analysis longer balanced.

Although test vs control preferred method analysis drug trials several statistical methods exist analyzing data one difference exists. referred multivariate analysis. even complicated, usually learn multivariate analysis first semester college ""intro statistics"". becomes slightly complicated dealing yes/no outcome. Usually watt second semester learn multivariate analysis yes/no outcomes. Still nowhere close rocket science. Damn Staten Island. Get shit together.

ICU numbers still low Manhattan hospitals, per COVID nurse friend. realize people would still alive covid, right? leadership short supply today's world ? Fuck people right? time. /s No, Pfizer one needs ultra cold -70 degrees. moderna one 95% effective needs -20 degrees long term storage. moderna vaccine also stored regular refrigerator temperature week. development death rates January August indicates decline life expectancy women men year. 84.7 84.4 years women 81.3 80.8 years men. 

snip increased spread covid-19 seeing may well lead extra deaths last two months year, could lead even lower life expectancy 2020,"" says Örjan Hemström.  1 January 31 August year, almost 6 500 deaths period 2019. That's 4,800 deaths expected based latest population projection 2020. replaced bigger disability problem people like allergies year believeable sense yeah prob skipped couple guidelines still 250k dead happen 3m 9332

good luck finding :( Agreed. Bachmann still around god talking . Something wearing mask Thank you! Re: anti-vaxxer, use term - least us - means specific thing. People vaccines, period. also get asking question/wanting clarify it, means others may well. I'll talk team definitely go back see fine-tuned that, appreciate pointing out.

And right, probably emphasize side effects more. think probably leaned much towards scaring people deemed far mark creates trust issues. 

Thank thoughtful stuff here, real. I'm screenshotting sending along! got email old friend back home decidedly anti-mask. calls anyone wears one weak. he's always one thinks tough means never taking precautions, driving dangerous conditions drinking driving. 

He's one friends know long time, years go realize different are. Yes is. work healthcare ""essential worker"" working location entire time say much relate this. also covid still dealing issues related yet people work wear one mask two on, scared. off-time cope 

This exactly I've coping. used hate sleeping hate awake. 

My heart goes you. deserve much better. &lt;3   ""sides"" sound much alike even realize it. giving option could wrong, black white, sure. I'm talking opinion though.

You're saying think people changing. Lack change, lack adaptation, absolute, also, changing from? They're changing cautious not, way since first lockdown.

The context chains way either statement, either covers whole timeline ""ever since first lockdown.""

You're still classifying people cautious not, matter many degrees categories. People adapting cautious adapting cautious. Hence, black white.

In context (i.e. online) kind classification easy skew one would agree ""cautious"" is, implicit assumptions likely getting different conclusions opinion. Way logistically complicated. would require weekly testing like 30,000 trial participants. labor laws toothless that's good way get fired. election long drawn-out process hard win (thank Taft-Hartley). guy shit stain. Right, went got tested today got positive, nobody would know ""Covid timeline"" am, right? Beginning? 3 days in? 7 Days in?

I could anywhere timeline.

So maybe 14 days ""relevant"" timeline beginning infection, (up to) days afterwards still test positive.

Doesnt mean much greater chance ""positive finished"" ""positive active""? CALIFORNIA #1 BABY Initially think purely motivated politics profits, point I'm cynical enough consider possibility they've made deliberate decision allow, even encourage, deaths infections. look response states like Florida hard imagine else could trying accomplish. least clear message they're perfectly fine it. I'm situation. husband insisting traveling parents' house (about 4 hour drive away) coming back day. 8+ hours car sit picnic table outside parents house wearing masks. said I'm comfortable going he's giving silent treatment lol. unfortunate we've pretty much eye eye type precautions. Thanks appreciate it,

But seem confused like am. person said referring covid Hospitalizations record Hospitalizations general. us hobbies like ""movies"" ""theme parks"" ""church"" ""going bookstore quiet Sunday morning drink coffee read magazines"" can't engage right epic mismanagement government. I'm glad caught Rona week ago compared upcoming wave. everything power since January stay safe inevitably got came work take test. symptoms clearing think I'll okay imagine needing hospital month tell go home good luck. This. hate people automatically clump together take vaccines think critically vaccines, FDA data anti-vaxxers hate vaccines. ""I good reason travel Thanksgiving. rest don't, do."" Many would’ve died invaded. Clearly don’t understand works. know mental health also concern. time people glued Reddit, level pragmatism whole thing go long way easing lot consciousness. It’s better take things face value give uneducated analysis (as I’ve seen quite commonly) 25-30% Americans gambling lives weekend, loved ones. People know, big crap shoot odds irrelevant.  isn't. can't even get college without bunch vaccines. new idea. Mandatory vaccines thing decades. sure! personal choice. see people household regularly seeing people Thanksgiving. lots health issues, choice made together. also babysit 2 kids could get covid them. already prevalent extent. 99% covid patients vaccine succumbing strain, 1% mink strain, take strain much longer spread think person two Covid strains once, likely infected strain 1 mink strain gets him. So... Another delay cyberpunk right? mean... release game country shape like this. coworker literally said, ""I take 0 precautions live life normally.. going catch it, would now."" Instead overdramatic realize also think way. one advocating full lock (everyone stays home besides service man distribute food). always trade-offs line somewhere becomes costly protect Covid specifically.

To even debate everyone needs realize line humanity lack people think line somewhere else do. kids went school last year local cosmetic surgeon (we pulled them, they’re home). Dr sent huge email kids school, “do research”, kids don’t get blah blah blah. paid penalty signed kids online school. 
That school first positive everyone sent home. Meanwhile mine thrived online school. Thank goodness. wait! son grieved father’s Covid death still saying decision Thanksgiving “a tough choice?!!!” don’t get 10% fewer Americans traveling Turkey day year pandemic raging away? Wowza. debunked nothing. Japanese leadership divided deadlocked precisely point missing.

Think way: *even after* first atomic bomb dropped, still took Japan NINE DAYS surrender. ""Private entreaties"" minority leaders not, fact shows reluctant actually charge give fight. Yeah turns flu also... joke. Optimal teleportation. That’s always case, yes good news literally commenting fact restaurants, stores, still open.

The government shut private gatherings barely peep anywhere money exchanges hands. I'm sick it. need aid package desperately gov head sand.

Maybe misinterpreted OPs comment every competent western government closed much possible paid people stay home practically COVID free. Same. long I’m getting fired trying work home kid she’s staying us vaccine. really understand vaccines work. truly protect enough people around also took it. Poland theocracy intense Middle East. understand sentiment, still think try save many lives possible, regardless politics. tell anti maskers get ICU bed people everything right got infected assholes gets medical care. world make sense? people need understand Swiss cheese theory. Yes, masks social distancing mitigate spread somewhat. ultimately two measures like Swiss cheese stacked top one another. slice cheese massive holes somewhat blocked another layer cheese. Mmmmm....I’m going fix grilled cheese sandwich now. I’ve trying warn particular damage months. Studies showing since least summer asymptomatic individuals clear entirely..   mid-June, three migrant workers staying Starved Rock Motor Inn Streator, Ill., 100 miles west Chicago, tested positive novel coronavirus. Upwards 50 workers staying motel tested negative. 

I'm investigative reporting writing good story, let's real here, Illinois already COVID hotspot throughout April May. Perhaps three sparked surge cases town somewhere. Perhaps delivery driver commuter student million vectors.

I can't see migrant workers much influence rural America Sturgis rally two months later half million people decided roll dice head home share everyone.

I'm convinced go history single damaging event throughout entire pandemic. people United States stand solidarity Polish people; wish pretender *harder* pandemic over, maybe it’ll go away!

Jokes aside, unfortunate year us western hemisphere. So... data says 5% population flying. OP concludes 10% drop total travel impossible. simply saying alternate explanation drop flight travel possibility. data showing 5% drop flight travel super useful prove overall trend different kinds travel. analysis faulty.

You got ass actually google it, here's something TripAdvisor showing 14% drop YOY. ""bunk"", hardly impossible. I'm not. lunch turning something not. born society never required wear mask go public get whay need survive lol. stop.

Edit: every please wear mask. feel like overcoming social awkwardness later life would far easier overcoming heart disease. think made right choice. Ha, read CNN day. Glad cute new catch phrase add lexicon. Sounds like half-Polish heritage husband would love there, know comes from. public confidence peer reviewed studies pfizer moderna show kind efficacy teased preliminary data. study test much, asymptomatic flu infections super uncommon. curiosity, routine asymptomatic testing flu covid, everywhere I'm familiar might testing asymptomatic people covid, flu. shut non-essential travel? College students returning home could considered essential, one getting plane right without super good reason. First thanksgiving teams Falcons playing. Last two thanksgivings interesting waiting day thanksgiving watch them, pretty unique feeling honestly whole country watching dissing lives people SSDI (my girlfriend is) fucking hate work bad think killing myself. Work boring. 

The one plus job besides pay pretty good ($80k fairly LCOL area) get lot vacation time. 

I bored times go work. keep thinking ""this sucks ass"" trying concentrate teaching college students. actually well enough get better average reviews sucks majorly. want retired, vacations I'm happy pig shit even though time stay house. 

As far goals productivity, that's things personal life, work. MMR vaccination mandatory Poland since 2003. That's pretty late, may lot adults yet it.

It also noted strong anti-vaccination movement Poland, even 'mandatory' vaccines \~95% uptake. so? fact there’s country handling worse US fucking sad. thought alone sheer stupidity. Fucking sad. f responding for? That's literally said, reread post might like COVID real way worse outcome ""within decimal point"" see non-believers directly called story. sad Massey said father always wore mask ventured out, trusted others around careful was. said anger comes thinking trust critical “People need know important drop guard, cautious, wear masks around everybody,” Massey said. complex global pandemic killing people one idea disease's effects one year? No, complex, gross mismanagement. snuffed urgency shown Wuhan. I'm literally talking last couple weeks, making predictions. New hospitalizations clearly decline. Yet sadly selfish assholes going times week got yet. Bad luck, reminder stay vigilant. Sounds like need wait Phase 3 trial data, comes next month, get full picture data. parents dont choice. Single parents example gotta pay Bill's:( mean lock anti-maskers specific area them? I'm that. make colony anti-maskers shut roads leading it.

So happy eat restaurant makes health rules? Maybe owner believe refrigeration, meat stored closet. since owner whatever want, maybe want cut meat floor bathroom ice scraper serve you.

Do understand horrible idea? people care one thing, money, whatever maximize profits. Including willfully endangering people.

Leaving decision hands business owners made Wisconsin one worst outbreak locations world. responsible enough ordered (and lot suing state get every single health order rescinded, endangering EVERYONE) US? remember school learning concentration camps Germany, bad be. one thing read it, teacher showed us famous black white documentary piles bodies, sick lying around. moment forget.

There needs documentary similar devastation COVID. much interviews, like videos Italy people vomiting blood pink foam up. Literally sloughing linings lungs nearly choke death. family Poland, well, heard nothing this. talked cousin weeks ago, adamant CoVid wasn’t Poland. warning put penis grinder. would need warning remind to. would let warning stop them. there’s trend right doubt sticks... restrictions intensified last week closing gyms restaurants malls (finally) It'll lifted couple months vaccines available every American. option protect there, justification mask order be. even talking ones survive issues hospital bills pretty mild, things considered. one person, no. community whole? Debateable. That's shockingly low number, would really positive true. assuming 70-80% going ignore them. really think worst compatriots rn. think he’s talking crowd says shit like avoid expecting vaccine time next year, personal experience lot no, changed title thr piece That's would vital make sure healthcare systems get overwhelmed. moronic people wear masks practice social distancing. Governments impose restrictions fast enough. People got tired ""flattening curve"", one important thing mitigate situation. Masks mandatory work (Covid-19 test station) wear outside normally unless gets really crowded. really need wear outside, even superspreader events inside locations something like 50% infection rate. canceled dental appointments year overwhelming sentiment power accept dead toll. think correct strategy.

This article children multiple organ damage ICU's running room. idea powering deaths massive damage children thought acceptable egregious. become humanity. agree points masks social distancing mitigate spread. Irresponsible, reckless, stupid behavior negate efforts.

The activities mentioned performed relatively safely.

Go outside fresh air sunshine meet groups see many people around go somewhere else.

Use curbside delivery. Wipe bag handles sanitize hands preparing food.

Go doctor wear mask full mini bottle hand sanitizer avoid using public options.

We can't eradicate disease vigilant mitigating spread. people like family, wife choosing see, visiting multiple households Thanksgiving. 

Oh parents 60 brother asthma. agree points masks social distancing mitigate spread. Irresponsible, reckless, stupid behavior negate efforts.

Totally. lot concern COVID *because* experience flu - Guillain Barre Syndrome full paralysis (and 99% recovery; long time ago, took year walk own) That’s insane! I’m San Francisco- SF Unified public school district. 100% remote we’re even ALLOWED go building without strict permission. Like, teacher safety #1 goal. haven’t asked interact ANYONE person since March 13. parts country absolutely insane. Thank you. Yeah big fuck medical hospital staff working grueling hours watching people needlessly die. Evangelicals US's bible belt listen Trump Pope.


Most hypocritical general population earth are. performing mental gymnastics worthy Olympics. 

You comparing water wearing mask. go outside agree, part member society, walk side walks (you get fined jaywalking). don’t push people way (assault). typically don’t cut line (potential loss service scorn). don’t take food drinks want others (theft). 

All society rules agree walk outside (also, clothes!). 

“Wear mask protect society airborne virus” realm. 

You drop sealioning. You’re looking bad faith argument. waaayyyyy low. forget usually take several years identify virus. definition virus identified quickly. explains also going fast. then? *not* pedantic point power-law exponential function (of x) thing, though. *completely different* functions arise completely different ways. underlying dynamics system exhibiting power-law growth generally next nothing common underlying dynamics system exhibiting exponential growth.

Now, quick google scholar search reveals spread coronavirus followed power-law countries, points pandemic. interesting because, again, underlying dynamics completely different. get power law everyone spreading disease fixed number people.

As pointed out, example correct know understand this. people not, though. second curve starts bend up, people say ""exponential growth,"" frequently replotted data semi-log plot, becomes clear actually exponential growth all. Maybe Google Moncef Slaoui read CNN article. “Just flu...” What's private company? CDC governmental organisation. case argument goes nowhere necessarily legal framework mean something inherently good correct thing doing.

Yes countries required vaccinations, yellow fever death rate 50%. quite thing though it? established vaccine using established method, established/understood dangerous disease. good one holiday season. betterment many this. I'd rather miss one opportunity enjoy many experiences family one bunch might get sick around enljoy more. Yeah \~economy\~ needs stay afloat. worth losing kids grandparents there.

Not OP, yes, believe this, vaccines almost universally safe ones going rigorous trials approval processes. 

Do really believe vaccine **can't** 100% safe?  hope classified ""support staff"" (I'm nursing student actively clinicals floors potential COVID patients). seeing medical students nursing students treated, surprised I'm not.

""I chilling plane there, suddenly, f\*\*\*\*in took off?!"" least Canada joined Covax. guess that's ultimate backstop vaccine.

How people see hypocrisy? aware. People want pretend like he’s progressive, he’s said nothing new. It’s gonna husband Thanksgiving. Got us Tofurkey, gonna make apple pie, mashed potatoes, stuffing, works. :D feast leftovers. 

But know step-sister family Thanksgiving normal. :\ No, it’s parents still claimed you. know many people gotten recently, do. One cancer patient, another lifelong smoker, one man late 60s whole host health problems. got pretty sick, recovered fine without go hospital. young people know barely symptomatic. lost sense smell/taste period. know somebody \*technically\* died COVID, lung cancer patient hospice. 

None changed overall opinion virus. Obviously dangerous spread uncontrollably. totally understand lots people, particularly younger healthier people, taking seriously.

Also asking getting tested locally, granted better nothing, much smarter thing would fly there, isolate two days, get tested, wait result.

ONE counting collateral deaths due unavailability beds, staff doctors

the potential catastrophic life loss staggering destruction health services I've barely made year expectation close end. wasn’t “temporary gain”. critical surviving initial wave severely underprepared for.  literally becomes flu point - also spreads asymptomatically. Drunk mind alone Meanwhile extremely beneficial “It’s nature destroy yourselves.”

- T-800, *Terminator 2* Nobody cares. looks 100© exactly like someone would take brass knuckles razor blade Wally World try fight cop something dumb. Yeah ten percent gatherings spread infection that's potentially upwards another 10.1m cases one event. spread outside gatherings. double likely count total cases one event, seems like it'll pretty catastrophic. Constantly reminded George Carlin line “Think smart average person is...and remember half dumber that.” I’d rather see family friends one year get see another 80yrs, “have to” see one potentially never see again. /smh here. excursions LA limited supermarket office (alone). even visit family NY vaccine distributed. Honestly, think I'm going done reading vaccine news like December 10th, since nothing big happening . are!!!! Facebook shit show lies fake news. Speaking Mountain West Conference, SDSU Aztecs fan chance? I'm still pissed fact Covid happened year realistic chance making Final 4. linked thread unproven theory? realize sound EXACTLY like facebook garbage anti-vaxers spew? 

You're EXACT thing do. Quoting unfounded garbage, latching onto tiniest excuse put everyone's lives danger selfishness. 

Do realize that? ""We exposing spreading viruses build resistance"" realize that's exactly anti-vaxers say measles? hoax masks lame idea even come americans. astroturfed Ya it’s Florida. people believe it’s hoax. Also, White House listed “ending Covid-19 pandemic” accomplishment Trump. it’s over, haven’t heard? That's know me. want one 😍 Hard agree. Further, lot gained day day social interactions going missed. Team cohesion suffer course months years.

There probably jobs become permanently office, return pretty close old way. Yeah one gonna that. like 20% people asymptomatic anyway, half population vaccinated 70% people even feel anything? cares case numbers point. Dinner family party friends read, unsanitary interaction animals humans places like wet markets continue primary mode animal human viral transmission. There's documentary Netflix called ""Pandemic: prevent outbreak"" worth watch.

As far climate change goes, concerned changing weather patterns affect ability grow food. spoiled relatively predictable weather model regions. weather patterns change extreme (too much water places, enough water others), might lose vital farmland many locations US.

On global scale, focusing sea level rise, hundreds millions people live near coasts need relocate.

Asking friend.... fucking pointless then. pulled weapon cop. afraid getting shot? someone gets covid natural immunity benefit getting vaccine? vaccine cause greater immunity vs natural immunity? bother? even help get society shut another two years. there’s whole bunch vaccines mandatory enroll public school and/or university US. It’s federal government mandate it’s certainly left individual. vaccines people need get like 1-3 shots childhood aren’t needed yearly (unlike flu vaccine) make sense people don’t realize many already required. course, claim religious exemption depending state you’re in, it’s generally trouble it’s worth people go along getting vaccines. Exactly. 
I look back previous potential pandemic scares past decade(s). 
I left wondering much avoiding full pandemic came proper responses. 
Then again, none met perfect trifecta COVID-19 does: long incubation, airborn easy spread, case fatality rate. 
Had SARS-CoV-2 case fatality rate MERS even SARS society know would over. 
Add r0 / transmission rate something like measles would need see full re-start society. posted many times here, think get point dude. 

maybe see coworkers would willing something instead kvetching reddit day. dreaded Walmart/Sam's Club banned persons list.

Thank you! school options virtual learning in-person learning. grades suffering first quarter (all virtual), sent back second quarter. 

I got cold within two weeks going back first time. stay home school, since year, it’s policy come in-person we’re experiencing symptoms sickness, even we’re absolutely sure it’s cold.

I got tested COVID-19. stepdad, high school chemistry teacher, said waste time. Thankfully, tested negative, made wake 5 debate whether return school. point, aware no-tolerance-for-sickness policy, wanted go anyway. backed almost hour later mom said go school advises.

This entire thing happened less two weeks someone four months older (I 13 yrs. 3 mths, 13 yrs. 7 mths) died COVID-19. fact opened schools vaccine came sickens (figuratively). prophesied, spread continues unchecked. I'm awaiting Friday's spectacle disturbed interest. trying stir anything, besides ad-hominem attacks anything counter claims? Ok, thanks. welcome take gene pool, would rather not... 1. someone working home since March, cut back spending lunches, coffees etc. little. increased spending ""stuff"" even outings venture outside actually increased offset this. suspect similar case people.
2. question always every employee's mind concerned job security. successful companies tremendous pressure increase revenue / reduce expenses way can, I'm sure conversation several companies already. anything, opinion, may accelerate timetable slightly. Brass knuckles big no-no legal wise.

He might end worse sentence pulling gun.  say articles read. talked surprised symptoms. articles found CNN CNBC. focused explaining doctors need upfront patients people become frightened refuse come back second injection. financially independent day left college, was, well, OK, 22. mean get vaccine day 1, supposed go back normal enough people get it. states, they're talking like 5% population getting vaccinated 2020 like 10-15% month that. 50%, that's things chill. math, like March/April. immunity works natural vaccine initiated. 

In cases natural herd immunity worked though? listened Trump claim would disappear. 


Also beginning ""lockdowns"" people walking around all. Actually considering state telecommuting really thing anymore, long solid internet connection done part remotely. Seriously half shit happens office anyway fucking needed time wasting. future work, pretty clear awhile. I've getting doorbuster ads weeks now, available online ordering, like ordered fabric today, part black friday sale, phone one work decided summer end person instruction today. wound asking faculty pivot person classes online last week instead due rising cases, basically want people went home coming back.

Everyone except entitled people avoid travel. still care long primarily older people dying. Dont use God's name vain Good. BC represent. Lol, judging downvotes, yep apparently not. stated fact here's source: number single day say anything country handled pandemic. Germany 15.000 deaths, U.S. 260.000. (Germany 1/4 population.) yeah, still huge difference overall. understand going invited parties parties allowed dramatic lifestyle change you. Tell smallpox sars. mean, that's plan. give credit though. I'm much better company nine months ago. I. people lack self awareness, could get looked positively? Yea man. believe people actually wanna spend time families cooped alone house bunch months. selfish bro understand people might seeing loved ones last time. 

I mentioned bullshit argument post still hitting it. Let ask you, family dying next year? know anyone family member dying next year? 

I absolutely understand people situation. people, some. know else could situation? could see person face face safely, without gathering large group people sitting around table indoors masks eating. could time. could've done August. could next month. love much, option? 

I would say wildly irresponsible tell people leading something opposite. even matter is. record, think grand sin go see one two family members Thanksgiving. think stupid totally unnecessary, harpoon somebody it. particular person it, yes wildly irresponsible. needs make personal sacrifice good people he's charge of. That's leaders do.  agree. fda approve? even morally justifiable use doses US we're going get mRNA booster later? southern hemisphere needs get vaccinated winter starts. (Yes, I'm aware care moral justification. also hard measure many vaccine doses available May. could well tens billions.) “do say do”. Stay safe, fuck bad example politicians. Sadly, half electorate support pandemic response, love fact he's ""sticking elitist scientists doctors"" saw picture. He’s starving death. don’t think Polish people ignorants Polish government don’t know/care deal COVID19. Majority people wearing face masks. Kids attending schools parents going work. compensation isolate know chance test risk losing income/job unfortunately decided keep working even mild symptoms. 
Huge protests cities may also affect spreading virus. trying figure ""side"" :) know else fucked up? giving family members covid resist eating turkey honor historic revisionism Congrats. Probably depend country in. developed world like say US, Canada, Europe etc they'll probably able get enough doses vaccianate majority population next year. Pfizer said produce like 1.3 billion doses moderna said could produce 1 billion doses oxford think produce similar amount. reading day Canada secured like 400 million doses various vaccines. think UK secured like 350 million doses various vaccines well. bet would enough 3 vaccines likely approved vaccinate majority population. Developing nations probably need wait abit longer Respect game I'm sorry tyranny that's befallen you. literally worse holocaust. I'm it. owe nothing anybody. enough internet today. Specific rules too, make Americans want break them.  got vaccine march?.... interesting. What? That's bullshit. @2: act like industry already courting nearly decade now. many companies already experimented way, many also realized pitfalls brought many portions back home result, time period. vaccine 100% effective, people refuse get vaccinated putting would likely turning back starts getting abused.

There plenty rights continually promoted reinforced. problem case right get vaccinated based reality, put burden others. I'm saying they're mRNA tech bud folks, there's something fun crowds around time year. Personally, gets Christmas spirit bit, since lot people get gifts, ton decorations up, etc. Also personally, job allow festive/get excited holidays (long hours, ton stress, lots deadlines, etc. right X-mas), I'll take feeling get it. Also, used fun night shopping friends (before overnight sales reduced lieu Friday morning-afternoon sales). perspective Black Friday.

All said, obviously non-online shopping year. I'm marking another experience lost coronavirus. worth complaining much, know others much, much worse do. Keep safe! also lot college students going home school. also problem, really choice. Yikes, know bad Poland.

And seems significant trend downwards daily new cases. Deep State paying doctors list Covid death certificates cancer heart attack. sure explain happing world. cases skyrocket move nursing homes community, starting peers get they’re *really sick* like oh, I’ve got flu sick, like oh, shit, need go hospital lips turning blue sick. People 20’s 30’s. friend turned 40 ventilator different state due overcrowding. might straw broke camel's back pretty sure war going reason, war going poorly US done point. like Russia declared war 1941 Japan would said ""welp, we're good, war over."" No. Neither grocery store workers.

😞 let rewrite history.

[No lockdown Sweden Stockholm could see 'herd immunity' weeks major parts Sweden, around Stockholm, reached plateau (in new cases) we’re already seeing effect herd immunity weeks’ time we’ll see even effects that. rest country, situation stable,” Dr. Anders Tegnell, chief epidemiologist Sweden’s Public Health Agency, told CNBC Tuesday. So.. wife pretty nervous getting it, getting tested often. went get rapid test morning. Negative covid, positive flu.. symptoms. LMAO shouldn’t able vote stop asshole yeah right. Come guys let's wear mask stay home... That's right folks, 100 million people country give shit anything themselves. propaganda success state TV doing. Although sure long work 600+ officially dying per day covid twice number looking excess deaths. people pulled sticks assess could lessened impact virus health care workers would less stressful life. possible US? thought always big problem food waste. Also long lines food might indicate people hoarding food (like toilet paper) rather true need. 

At local grocer, get loaf bread 99c, good amount chicken breast 3-4$, etc. $10 last week actually pick choose carefully Yeah except people get cancer second hand smoke live close someone smokes. They're getting cancer walking smoker times sidewalk. Gotcha, yeah most/all antibiotics something used viruses. human body pretty amazing fighting viruses, times get virus us able fight it, either via vaccine, virus itself. reason faired well likely due immune systems robust due slew things. got bargained for. feeling true Purchase air purifier. 

Good quality. crap ones. 

Probably looking 200-300 bucks real good one. vaccine even considered mandatory.

I know right? crazy diseases, *this* first vaccine ends (almost) mandatory. tell to? It’s President even right wing trump, love him. 

Ripping apart country ego fragile admit wrong “it’s flu”. like read 3 sentences WWII wiki page decided post this. misguided you? Awesome hear you’re safe family well! honestly wish I’d done sooner - it’s night day mental difference trying deal year own. May soon, hope folks staying safe meantime! There's middle ground accepting apparently changed mind months pressure forgetting selfishly behaving moment could (and should) lead example, praising every time appears article freaking pope. governmant. 

we're turning pro russia, totalitary state high church influence. governmant supports polish 'patriots', fact religious fanatics, anti-women, anti-lgbt bullies throwing rocks people want life free. they're taking steps ban lgbt marches, fired constitutional tribunal's judges (which suppose serve death) put pro-governmant people place, led year revoking progressive abortion laws - abortion legal pregnency threatening mother's life (abortion rape fetus' serious defects banned).

 Plus strong oposition governing party - even though oposition majority votes recent elections votes split among oposition parties. worry regarding covid end vaccine reaches priority groups general population? quite. position immediately dissolved war, part get Japanese accept occupation. 1947 constitution, written supervision Supreme Commander Allied Powers (SCAP) stripped nominal power. left symbolic figurehead (which deserved frankly), akin Queen England currently. Ultimately, US remolded Japanese government constitution, exactly line Japanese demanding prior getting nuked. It’s definitely higher. TSA reporting extremely high foot traffic airports last weekend. people going somewhere it’s likely cabin isolate. Lots people relying negative COVID test last week, totally disregarding travel plans potential infect. You’ve got millions people traveling airports, sharing space planes, going eat family, going giant family gathering Thursday. could go wrong? know downvoted either. Retail workers law enforcement paid enough deal shit. We've already seen several stories people violently attacked even shot asked someone wear mask. One problem is, government removed detailed statistics voivideships discrepancy numbers cases overall number exceeded 22k cases, found 19yo guy consolidating data hobby.
Now nobody knows sure many cases actually. officials hide actual numbers. dos semanas mas! Lockdowns without support program help without income pointless. can't USA try two month trial? Combine national lockdown COVID control March one else would die unnecessarily.

You print world's money supply. power. respect fighting spirit quest self-autonomy, though seems hijacked bad faith figureheads far-right recent years. I'm guessing live somewhere warm and/or wear glasses. worry, equality disenfranchisement. able vote proven yourself. Suffice say, fail. ""may?!?!?!?"" 

how ""absolutely""! hanging around LOOKING UVC lamps! many want bet even considered testing quarantine requirements head home? They'll ignore that, too. Sometimes drop math bomb keep everyone toes. I’m fully aware math + Reddit always = trouble.

I know guy lost letter keyboard fight last year here. It’s joke. Same, make light people sick-sick that’s anxiety year.

I forgot word “box” yesterday. dozen times day get reminded something fucked boss think running patience.

Yesterday seems like year ago March feels like yesterday. correct. Dry ice would probably work better. Meets temperature requirement probably cheaper. K don’t take bed hospital dumb ass gets sick. Deal? Go it. Wind hospital Covid maybe sepsis....put belly breathe.....right ventilator needed 50/50 shot.... top US doctor said results ""science press release."" So, dig deep now. lot information obscure, honest, I'd rather focus positive news, BioNTech Moderna vaccines.  hard find doctor willing write one reason.

That's improve system make something cant forged cant transferred someone else. Ideally something cant lose would good too. Yes actually no.

Found Russian government really showing it’s true priorities dependence capitalism going quite literally death us. hope like apocalypse movies us manage avoid becoming zombies. rural hospital worker, call BS can't afford pay travel nurses. hospital part larger system (as are) took away 401k match, pay hazard pay, gave us one-time-only $400 ""give thanks bonus"" week, cancelled annual raises, operating capacity, patients cots hallways, we're working stated nurse-patient ratios (we usually get 4 5 patients, we're somehow supposed safely care 7-8.) Oh, **and posted $3 billion (that's billion B) quarterly profit.** Bullshit can't pay us more. problem is, willing pay us more, people leaving. hope pay it. I'm wearing masks. think choice. Lol arrested Thanksgiving dinner. 
Weirdest times ever lived last 4 years. They're ones talking it, though. see, maybe forced upon everyone. I'd rather take anti-vaccer, even though rushed AF. going make people hesitant vaccines general, wich long run think worth it. fonts, size really bad. Agree points, even last. &lt;Putting tinfoil one could interpret lots disparate pieces coming together. Weird times. yeah, I'd probably go 48 hour scenario. anything I've done least *some* research least pros/cons even weigh. sounds like nutcase alright. pray doesn’t kill ppl outlandish rhetoric. rights us want infected someone unvaccinated?

That's get vaccinated for. many people going skip quarantine testing requirements go back work Monday. Sorry hear upset 😄 J&amp;J one shot, really good tbh works. Hmmmm hit overpopulated refugee homes camps? 1k deaths day half attempted lockdown measures 2k day lax measures. even need calculator concerned. Bruh, I'm Asian. close down. failed year. Start fresh August see multiple friends 30’s gotten *really fucking sick*, you’ll take even seriously. Black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, blood. horse tyvm Please do. Many employers lackluster best enforcing mask rules. Newsmax cable think OANN mainly online. There’s also live YouTube Newsmax always check see new reason conceding is. feel like they’re slowly moving towards accepting results certifications announced don’t want lose viewers like Fox. It’s going get harder harder, guess they’ll come something run whatever Trump says basically saying he’s conceding without really saying (kind like whole GSA thing).

I’m feeling next four years schism Republican Party, especially lose Georgia Senate races. They’ll regroup decide want keep going Trump road find someone new face party. doubt Trump run 2024 regardless, interested see Republican challenger be. saw 64% somewhere. I'm essential worker, work grocery store hospital, I'm pretty much invisible. That’s paid cash test. 10 years you’ll checking box whether you’ve ever Covid trying get insurance it’s going cost money. 14 European countries much higher death rates US yesterday, remains seen US actually reaches levels rather either Atleast show vitamin deficiency help. unless eat lot fish live somewhere get plenty sunshine outdoors, basic suplaments good idea winter. Like said I'm masks. making comparison. think people still choice free. ~~Luck~~ Hard work problem! fired. Enjoy freedumbs! ...population death rate Poland currently 4x US ...

According overall coronavirus death rate Poland less half US. (802 vs. 396 per million). BTW: Sweden - 647, Italy - 849, Spain - 934. new cases deaths skyrocketed government relaxed restrictions allowed children go schools September. Ever since government handling pandemic disaster. timed controversial changes law hoping people would hit streets protests wrong. current government disaster everything else OT. family already Thanksgiving last weekend. brothers invited told parents bad idea. completely misleading headline.

This test *measures amount neutralizing antibody present.* article clearly FDA cautioned much remains unknown nature Covid-19 neutralizing antibodies humans high level antibodies necessarily guarantee immunity virus.

This test *facilitate research subject.* concert ongoing research tests T-cell immunity, may eventually result combination test eventually show ""how well someone protected virus."" test that, article clearly states. hope 11 female staff family start dying you. 10 people vaccinated 70% much better one 95% (considering price distribution). Yeah, they're testing more. one dying: &lt;3 OP's username first thought ""those paragraphs big!"" realized internet ruined brain..... 1993 World Trade Center bombing? Trudeau spends much time trying look good. He’s got head stuck woke ass. Give boogaloo boi - master race heroes screwed big time. you’re peddling lies challenging details everyone. arrogant, thought knew better gambled entire society lost. contempt everyone else selling ball bearings cold steel nazis WW2 valid explanation though. Data useless without analysis. I'm going stay inside hide next four months. Well people hear “essential workers” think front line grocery store employees people work distribution centers, people work food manufacturers distribution centers, people manufacture truck parts, work truck repair shops etc. work factory, business essential trucking industry nobody ever thinks us think essential workers. anyone know mask supplier sells decent reusable masks something along lines ""I support healthcare workers"" written it? think time show people wearing masks. Rad Traddy. basically confused Mega Protestants. want either. 16 days ago, said Sweden already reached herd immunity. 

Since then, cases going Sees Signs Far Herd Immunity Stopping Virus  There’s little evidence herd immunity helping Sweden combat coronavirus, according country’s top epidemiologist. 

Does change mind? realize ""forced"", everybody require it. Completely different thing. :) Lol. Great analogy. One little oversight 18 year commitment. Whenever damn thing rear view mirror we're clear, I'd like sit people coffee shop maybe even camping around campfire share life experiences monstrosity done us.

And I'm sometimes petty, part mind setting pack corona beer ablaze send damn virus kind symbolic Viking funeral. “Because implication” ;) every year. never people thanksgiving nothing changes us. 

Full thanksgiving spread possibly setting Christmas decorations house. I’m excited Yes he’s charge right now. /s Get ready mental gymnastics people use justify 400,000 number. “ going die anyway media calling everything covid death”. know someone dies isn’t real. Thanks... I'll need it. see way problem though, like said. Catch-22. Depressed work, need quit. need work end homeless. Can't even get SSDI depression go away work. judge people big party middle pandemic. Based comments, I'm doubting mental problems. Sociopaths get upset watching people die.  Okay. guess seems silly continue getting tested without single symptom known contact. industry definite pressure increases company's tax burden. know one person let go long got cryptic warning co-worker. everywhere obviously oil gas weird often furlough employees weeks things slow unemployment frowned upon. top benefits lost hours state negligible even COVID increases. questions I'm asked time is, 'Hey, doc, vaccine waiting for?' answer ... **I'm going take vaccines that's made available that's authorized U.S. Food Drug Administration,""** says. ""Don't overthink it. wait. Get vaccine can.""

&amp;#x200B;

I see vaccines hitting drugstores March.

by data.

&amp;#x200B;

it entirely possible.. 

VaxA (while 95% trial) might 89% pregnant.

VaxB (also 95% trial) turns 99% pregnant.

side effects same.. 

why take one gives +4 instead -6?

BTW - unclear pregnant women included COVID-19 vaccine trials**   recognizes developing potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccine broad use critically important combat pandemic, including potential use adolescents, women childbearing age, pregnant women,"" Pfizer's statement read.

&amp;#x200B;

now swap vax percentages (asthma, diabetes, obesity, cancer, COPD, HIV, under/over 18 - etc etc etc).. could see ""any"" might best decision.

&amp;#x200B;

it could well Feb.. instructions change - call doctor.. knows medical history.. recommend..

&amp;#x200B;

or may go online ""check apply"" see ""AI recommends""

&amp;#x200B;

i suspect people ""no brainer option"" enough data collected.. 

&amp;#x200B;

and see 

***LOT DUDE..*** 

(makes fucking giddy, too)

&amp;#x200B;

information going come fast furious..

&amp;#x200B;

Biden says staff spoken **Fauci**: 'He's very, [confirmed he’s spoke president-elect’s team ***hopes stay role*** head National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases.

&amp;#x200B;

\- worries, Tony. *""It happen mine""* \- million families thanksgiving. Sounds like problem. 

If feel risk death, stay home. way around. common across US. cannot move uproot family. home. love teaching, may leave profession next 3-5 year (maybe sooner depending job market). job security can’t imagine trying start middle recession pandemic. going slow way week Thanksgiving we'll return probably 2500+a day. field hospital even get used first time? worry (and US), governments, media people perhaps focus much mortality rates death count therefore estimate severity global pandemic. Perhaps focus effects **long term chronic health** issues (organ functions, brain therefore cognitive functioning, mental health, fatique, cardiovascular problems etc.) virus seems cause still even \~year later, know much less about. negative effects could society, functioning, economy, healthcare etc, thing keeps running rampant eventually ends infecting, lets say half nations population. 

Death count awful, get wrong, believe gives governments/media/people wrong sense real severity, thing might (the whole ""it flu!"" mentality). 

I worry things, like-minded people here? handwashing, use facemasks also valuable infectious disease control, especially circumventing droplet example, effectiveness surgical masks N95 masks blocking transmission SARS 68% 91%, Facemasks, fitted properly, effectively disrupt forward momentum particles expelled cough sneeze, preventing disease transmission. Even facemasks ill-fitting, still able interrupt particles airborne viruses sufficiently, pathogens reach breathing zones people non-medical, cherry-picking narrative.  know common rare incidents are, know long-term temporary.  That's point - there's lot know virus, risk calculation lot complicated ""If kill harmless""

See statement right 100% agree with. want dive [the paper 

Which did. Originally back June types articles first came around paper. funny part is, posted reddit back general consensus would alarming true need wayy larger sample size.

This whole thing dependent paper came JUNE. questions sent local physicians.

There concrete evidence around now. still brought news now. going tell freaking 5 months concern originally raised paper 5 months ago source.

Now lets say article linked original paper june, pointed another independent paper similar findings September-November. freaking value add original source. 20 minutes took day read article would worth it. adding smoke original claim. 


We're dealing educated researched googlers want debate claims. Dont make easy them. 

So yea came axe grind. one hope higher standards share reports / articles around one scariest world wide issues we've seen long time one died outbreak, thank goodness, posted show impact single event many unrelated lol lifted mid December, even Sydney. Meanwhile hospitals getting overwhelmed states, schools classes person, can’t go big sporting events... need go on? fair, driving fast could too. quarantine COVID. We're making braised beef scalloped potatoes tonight grill backyard true garbage human, salute   Show part constitution says rights suspended situation describe. someone grandmother severe dementia, thankyou, thankyou, thankyou. people like grandmother got fast, adequate care, survived COVID whole bunch underlying conditions(and honestly, they've insanely great job keeping COVID out, well - unlucky enough one 40 facility couple thousand residents).

 Visitation shut got chance see couple times summer(complete disposable body-condom hugging), struck well actually doing, well comprehended going - doubt due quality care recieving. 

I literally want cry writing post, worry quality life much, especially post-COVID world. work means much many others there. I'm infinitely thankful people working there, you, too, work families. extremely difficult, often thankless underpaid job. grateful. Well least laughs end here. None inmates this. scammer using inmates, common, know filing claims therefore avoid detection duplicate claims issue. death row inmate's names easy find, known like Peterson. watch, either massive outside prison scam, someone prison running none names even clue used. Thanks insight, lot learn issue. Let’s hope gets addressed new administration — looking extremely dire. Yeah, going say. I’ve seen grandmother twice since started, outdoors masked low infection area. safe, think helped mental health too. Can't meet masks, open space distancing?

Not really sure Thanksgiving social dynamics work guess that's option. still get normal unemployment benefits everyone normal times relies jobs. shitty situation letting virus run rampant without restriction free costs either. easy fix right now, even medical advances.

There actually, rich presidents. demanding unconditional surrender murdering nation's civilian population morally reprehensible. 

Because point, almost war recent history ended ""unconditional surrender"" one side. Rather, customary sides negotiate mutually satisfactory peace treaty.

Because United States right Asia first place. Japan bothering anyone U.S. warships sailed harbors 1853 forced Japan sign unfavorable trade treaty, led European powers same. Japan watched America Europe colonized entire rest Asia, created mass opium epidemic China, murdered 3 million civilians Philippines exterminated indigenous population Australia New Zealand.

Because United States would go commit mass murder Korea, Vietnam, Laos Cambodia, day impose people Asia massive network military bases threaten bring death destruction people Asia moment.

Because America go fuck leave rest world alone once. He's positioning future GOP politics, knows way get Trumpy possible. Best luck you! 2,611 may 6 highest ever? not, was?  fabricate data blame countries, easy. F Moderna 7 vaccines already clinical trials. CMV PCV phase II. work fairly large southern CA district. California Teacher Association (CTA) running whole “Only it’s safe” campaign. General education teachers required begin in-person teaching. fact, special education teachers required either, complete in-person assessments students. DIS service providers (Speech language pathologists, occupational therapists, adaptive PE teachers, schools psychs/counselors) told offer resume in-person services. However, teachers given option teach virtually classrooms, school site like 75% teachers working site. pisses off. go in, teachers work home making irresponsible decision come increasing exposure. brought local branch teachers union president, ccd CTA point person. basically said frustrating placing teachers convenience literally life. CTA guy basically told would restrict number teachers campus ability help fact I’m forced come site. pointed fact “Only it’s safe” campaign disclaimer fact include special education (clearly it’s safe teachers would come back), basically said true, resuming person special education services 100% decided district union powerless. I’m debating jumping ship public school system know health life worth. district hotspot recently 4 employees working site tested positive, feel like it’s matter time get sick. Lmao right. parents aren’t real apparently. guys every time get body patted get airplane? really want drive around 130mph everywhere yell fire theaters well. rights.  Currently? Death rates March/April aren’t equivalent death rates Nov. that’s learned effective treatments last half year. federal funds used help South Dakota pandemic relief treatment handed state. officials office holders proven inept handle left process. want help people can't trust voted anymore right thing. Moderna! Sorry mean really choice?

they stay inside campus apts (majority living campus anyway), instead traveling cities ""celebrate"" holidays. Exactly. I’ve everything can, thought stuck another ~2 years really drains morale politicians DaRe SaY ThAt!! ClUtCh PeArlS!   /s Vamoose. 

Edit: angry great 🤣 Whim? global pandemic. People dying getting long term effects disease. Wtf? guess hope never sick rest life need doctor? ridiculous. everything it... refuse support people socially, judge engaging behavior we're asking go work enable. hope good time, lol. Point stands. Cultural differences still, know, relevant. 

Limiting house guests, limited capacity, mask mandates. Looks like general restrictions here. condescending want, like aren’t really anything lol. data fir trial mess combining two different studies. Wired good article messy data posted. I’ll find link here.

Edit: here’s link post:[data isn’t Food stamp amounts cut duration shortened most/all states (unless kids, possibly) since Great Recession. Nowadays get 3 months within span 2 years states I've lived in, unless working 20+ hours week still qualify (but income limits low people fall category). working, looking job states require volunteer hours.

We social safety net really since Clinton's welfare reform 90s cut everything bare minimum. TANF (what people think say welfare - cash benefit) anywhere near enough cover non-food expenses rent utilities, also short duration, applies certain households kids. Add stagnant wages inflation, increase min wage, higher rents, etc. really difficult imagine. SSI around $700/mo able get it, also usually can't work that's -all- income aside food stamps section 8 lucky enough qualify. Section 8 waiting lists enormously long (for housing) live 70% vouchers forfeited apartments accept payment rent.

If in/around food banks food pantries last several years volunteer worker pretty obvious issue simmering surface years - line wait hours behind least hundred two hundred people food pantry nearest even pandemic. slightly visible ""middle class"" families falling cracks, working class folks hit hard business closures. Pretty easy check you’ve shadowbanned. Please, cry even more. think black white painting.

Let's take Thanksgiving. know families making changes, sure. know families meeting anyone else, too. also know lot families, mine included, planning smaller gatherings and/or outdoor gatherings. families mitigating risks still taking some, too. unfortunately doesn’t power mandate lot things, example new rules wants schools mandated state leaders. That’s way german government works. offer advice suggestions them. said, really good job first wave, way til October still better lot European countries. it’s good enough. Luckily masks already mandated since April germany need clamp schools private gatherings numbers come down. actually worn proper FFP2 mask cold weather? gets wet almost instantly. water nowhere go. FFP3 bit comfortable water drips seal. Come on, guys, exaggerate issue. leftovers taste fine; takes several days symptoms develop several days compromise lung function point external ventilation required survival.

/s Yes. fulfilled large ventilator order government continue make masks Lake Orion, MI, think. vaccine?  federal funds used help Floridians Pandemic relief treatment handed state. officials office holders proven inept handle left process. want help people can't trust voted anymore right thing. interesting, thanks defense mechanism you’re using don’t accept people’s opinions. You’re using tactic everyone even strays inch everything believe true somehow stupid uneducated. 

While works inflate ego, works everything else, outreach, discussion, attempting influence people mindset.

So decide important - padding ego making difference. making difference, lot work really need change. suggest start immediately. report saw Chicago NBC station last night indicated dosage tailored individual. least he's consistant hole basically average person unless healthcare. Considering lack flu spread 20% easier handle flu normal, severe. 

I realize make lot people mad, don’t think American people pay hospital administrators lack planning, excess capacity. beds falling even population gets older needs medical care above.

Also American hospital ICU percentage chart intresting: think relies modeled data direct data hospitals. Exactly! I’m rather extroverted, take precautions.

However, SECOND it’s safe go again, bet I’ll it. intend comment reply original post? really go person made joke slipping tickets coffin?

&amp;#x200B;

For someone saying take COVID seriously, sure took snide comment seriously. dad anti masker trumper said Texas 6,000 deadly crashes yesterday yet still let people drive. know gets numbers along lot dumbasses numbers keep going up.  nothing conversation. weren’t safe, got infected. Leopards ate face. 

I’m thankful essential workers, please don’t infect families, claim it’s shock. Stay safe. Lucky you, lol. I'll go see friends, I'll spend long weekend beach... things like that. I'm saying I'll never step foot bar again...I'm saying move goal posts back vaccine, I'm certainly spending summer 2021 way 2020. hate admit I’m one them.

Lost job spring wife used unemployment benefits.

We still roof head clothes back 😇

Happy Thanksgiving everyone! Honestly?If ignore warnings, responsile, even mock plandemic ""no big deal"" ""cure cant worse cure"" backdoor eugenics, yes people responsible inevitable consequences actions.

Fuck everything this. agree guy. pope everyone else telling put mask not? There's something seriously wrong head. counties reporting lot cases pretty small; also note new cases vs existing cases -- Texas outbreak widespread seriously impacting small-town counties.

Texas mess.. small-town counties bastions anti-maskers, can't imagine things going go well Thanksgiving. Going lot family gatherings end badly, IMHO. it. Broken clock, earth talking regarding “reset”? late... Anyone watched NBA Draft knows many people going gathering Thanksgiving. Briefings Tuesday Thursday, number updates Tuesday Friday. 

A bit late update numbers today, sorry.

That's fair, I'm sure Fox's actions (ex. calling Arizona) are, indeed, motivating many people turn away network. 

However, Trump actively pushing alternatives, criticized Fox several things (ex. [The Golden Goose ). feel naive think people take word things (ex. Trump says Fox News lying?! better switch Fox News!) Thanks! edited in. ya know, right? Call 9/11 whatever want there's nothing cowardly hijacking plane box cutter crashing symbols everything hate. people ballsy hell actually died believed in. mom canceled Thanksgiving bc wife close, wife ER nurse NY. told mother ER wall wall covid mother decided risk dad 79 high blood pressure diabetic. I'm honest tho, mom worried get go wanted reason cancel it. Polish citizen add government started much less tests improve data idea make less people sick (i expect everything them). Poland North Korea Europe propaganda. don’t worry, decrease recommended quarantine time virus like, ok won’t spread now. thing happened extended family TX too. family reunion, kids carriers nobody knew, everyone got sick, pretty badly. Fortunately ""got lucky"" AFAIK, they're still about. article linked,

*The appendix doesn’t say became plan. don’t even know Oxford-AstraZeneca team followed it. fact, it’s impossible know, point, many analyses researchers run, data. That’s scientific red flag flashing lights.*""

So may cherry picked data... mess. It’s important help stop gatherings. El Paso disaster. isn’t feasible sustainable dumbass. Lol 

Travel still industry, trade necessity; like understand economy globalized, right? Yeah last ditch appeal week ago. Literally one change mind today Absolutely! get medical advice Florida real estate salesman turned reality TV star! remarked trick-or-treating past Halloween unnecessary irresponsible pandemic big deal skip year... pretty much pilloried it. no, definitely expect forgo thanksgiving, even higher totem pole celebrations far concerned. hand found single Cornish hen, aparently that’s go-to us going alone, it’s everyone evidence COVID-19 affects behavior hosts maximize reproductive opportunities virus? Hard without knowing vaccines adverse events referring -- think take guess, feel *very* comfortable saying chance vanishingly unlikely, want put words mouth.

Mind sharing particular vaccines adverse effects concerning you? Large hospitals segregate limit exposure better. Host two sets staff positive negative cases. Contactless administrative functions. Specialized departments. Rural hands less people involved process higher individual risk. That's assumption, anyway. it’s fine! wasn’t sure misread that’s asked. agree feel joy love healthy. Cool let’s I’m sorry people downvoted you. ask excellent questions I’ve questions. I’ve hoping group behind scenes working (how not??) we’ve heard desperately little news. old school yellow fever card seems like poor solution digital age going need passport frequently. there's big crowd, there's bound people wearing masks, chances sick person wearing mask spreading germs around pretty high. change minds, though.  people stubborn, indoctrinated, emotionally broken ever consider might wrong this.

There literally people die decades' time 100% certain Trump saint COVID hoax. Good one, eh? probably phrased poorly. advocating people feel joy loved ones healthy safe. Keep way smart.

I ""gathering"" people live with, want responsible everyone.  It’s 8months this... part smoking doesn’t result harming others large scale. that’s taking account tobacco lobby’s attempts say good people back day via fake authorities, it’s quite same. vote sue following guidelines. Keep copy email track conversations everyone. Ok that's fine vaccines. previously read (obviously OTHER) vaccines side effects rear ugly heads MANY months administration.

Guarantee us new vaccines long term history safety made entirely new process, similar timelines adverse effects.  makes sense don’t know people downvoting truth 
Every body refuses acknowledge dangers virus continuously bring death rate  Wow dense. That’s point. border remains shut, likely countries get shit together, life go back normal. Unfortunately, UK didn’t that. saying man.. Thats exactly says. get STD, least homies know getting in. Many people coping (hiding) Personality Disorders COVID.

The extra stress stripping away thin veneer. I’m pretty disappointed. friends NYC smart usually rational, visiting family holidays year. “It’s bad parents live” “the positivity rate pretty good NYC right now” excuses they’ve given. Can’t believe can’t sit holidays one damn year.

BS, definitely something know about. wouldn’t believe amount state plates right mostly NY, NJ, PA. don’t get vacations pandemic? Thanks answering this. makes confident CommonPass vaccine passport use? would like think everyone want body. abortion, severe body modification, ect. 

For example. going determine animals pets killed someone allergic dogs.

Or one allowed eat peanuts allergic it? Oh see know benefit people free live lives?

And I’ll repeat, doubt economy better would enforced lockdowns standing largely impacted lockdowns neighboring countries. honestly imply anything could person's informal writing style use ellipses end sentence like that...

Interestingly enough, common trait ADHD similar conditions, have, digress...

It seems took fact used three periods row instead one cause assume intent was, unfortunately wrong counts, merely proposing explanation different sources different end-of-day numbers trying imply anything possibility try get argument “or using different hours foe day ~~idiot, isnt obvious~~? 

If stopped sentence word ""day"", we'd page there, Idk took three periods instead one mean way hostile was.

I honestly know mind automatically defaulted two extreme possibilities rather dozens civil possibilities including simple actual one, ""Maybe using different hours call days' numbers?"" frustrating must ones always sacrificing. restaurants still allowed dine customers? bars still open? retail outlets allowed participate black friday? give holidays.  politics Hollywood ugly people seattle resident unemployment idea guy talking everyone went ...which evident case count blowing country. warned multiple times going get burned touch flame say overweight warned could die dont anything help yourself...then onus you.

Wrong answer sub bizarre misinformation anti-scientific = pro $ know, Coronavirus nocturnal. get envo mask. NIOSH verification. suffering survive form people lives destroyed lockdowns. 

“Long COVID” fear mongering nonsense that’s you’re trying refer here. irresponsibility people like dad’s boss astounding. posted story recently. got removed mods.  one go store food medicine. available pickup services now. want expose yourself, go out. demand government come hold gun someone else's head make comply vision handle this. amoral borderline fascist.  means rest. alone, away people. tell right least 50% want right away, bothersome.

What sort long term tests done vaccines prove safe someone takes ""right away""? Uh, no. Donkey Kong Country. Oh yeah. sucks man hope figure already 1.5k day Dallas, 3k DFW metro, yet thanksgiving, need refrigerated truck soon. fuck.... Trump lame duck... might able to. federal government pushed coronavirus-related lawsuit protections institutions. know many actually made actual law/policy, whether OP's case would fall that.

"" Monday, McConnell reiterated call lawsuit protections ""everyone related coronavirus"" -- whether doctors, nurses, businesses, K-12 schools colleges -- covering period December 2019 December 2024. cool.

None vaccines tested long term safety, quite reasonable someone, especially young healthy person, want wait see things pan out.

If know, H1N1 vaccine Europe caused people develop narcolepsy two years taking it. people actually get board, ignore subvert restrictions? makes pay attention polite significant other. always improve believe me.

Good lord y'all need hobbies. can't determine someone body. reason people taking seriously majority people get virus asymptomatic mild symptoms. wear one 8 hours day, issues here. Okay... another thought experiment; again, don’t think hard. 

If shut boarders one country lockdown synchronized. open boarders month later.. however; ANOTHER country lockdown couple weeks cases rising.... one country travels country fresh lockdown... what’s gunna happen? I'm also proud question peoples' pride, ask justify it, give reasons proud. actually quite strange put much effort looking reasons trying tell proud I'm from. make feel better sharing information me?

I'm proud I'm from, also happy others proud too. Hopefully one day happy others prideful :) Well I'm terribly sorry go something entire planet went through.

FTFY

Seriously, wants pay money get equity to? That’s want everyone get vaccine it’s ready. horror movies give reason 😢 I'm completely uneducated. Dumb rock. wife asks we're killing planet. like reassure we're killing planet. planet fine, we're simply destroying ability live it. 

Somehow find comfort Someone's triggered haha. That's leap. please call sheep, least masks help situation trying protect people. Plus respecting fact get others sick. public health crisis, political opinion.  No, opposite. brother works restaurants confirmed restaurant large parties continuously throughout COVID violation Governor mandate. also helps overall distribution. X number people don’t worry get it, take appointment slot (or however work), etc. cops

Fucken hell pathetic city That's Covid-19, vaccine, complete utter peanut. Hospitalizations consistently throughout pandemic followed cases 2 weeks. trends follow, hospitalizations continue increase. problem people able treated due many people hospitals. treat people room for? counter-point Moderna Pfizer apparently using every available piece equipment world make mRNA vaccines, they're still 15x expensive per dose vectored vaccine doses. like making mRNA vaccines would give us doses faster. (I direct sources either statements, taken grain salt; I've read /r/COVID19. particular Pfizer vaccine supposed priced ""below market rates"" $40 dose, Oxford one supposed $2.50 per dose.)

I think argument better pretty pointless. know better tried - right choice. even makes sense case Sputnik using two different vaccines two doses. Looks like long term mRNA going better, pretty good news. words illegal continue mask-up public building vaccine out? Schools large employers also used fight Polo well. large factory employees thousands people already collected single point meaning inoculate lots people short time. freezes Ford buys likely sold much lower cost donated (good PR) areas cannot afford new.  Glad don’t live nothing mayor talking ass enforcement phones made China China community transfer. USA Malaysia covid-free. ""Save people economy"" false dichotomy. got false positive August?

For context disappointing was:

She personally created Public Health related projects home country. 

Her Dad died painful death COVID August. 

He lived home country due COVID restrictions couldn’t attend funeral. 

Their religious beliefs required buried swiftly, couldn’t postpone funeral. 

She lives high risk mother grandmother. 

She high risk 3 year old daughter doesn’t wear mask. 

She left job, drew unemployment, withdrew daughter daycare due exposure risk. 

.

. expect places simply ask prove vaccinated. used smoke crack?  probably go 15 n95 day 10 regular surgical masks ( per 13 hour shift ER). Glad living Ireland days .... absolutely heartbroken health care workers without adequate PPE can’t even tell you’re kidding not. *sounds* like something OANN would say That's good. I've demonetized twice shit hits hard. However they'll able reapply 30 days lot people literally changed anything remonetized. think completely wrong approach get Americans take public health measures. *I realize many disagree me.* formal qualifications medical/science field, read lot literature/studies. 

That said I’ll explain would charge public health country. would first broadcast individual risk death/hospitalization/etc. I’d probably app part. also news. Example: would primary message, actual deaths, certainly actual cases. 

I’d develop guidelines give choices. I’d probably give examples “ultra low risk” “low risk” “medium risk” “high risk” “ultra high risk” activities. 

I’d also remind Americans consult high risk individuals ask ok meeting assuming want act matter do.

But telling Americans won’t choice taking personal risk months backfire, backfire hard. Especially vaccine. commentary I’ve seen thread suggests apparent plateau recorded cases result lack testing capacity. take number tests % positives account could misleading suggest actual cases plateauing falling. article negative. free market action. nurses making 8k week, celebrated. It’s OK. still love you! good news. cannot end global pandemic without global collaboration. There's point say could pass phase 3 experiment may save hundreds thousands lives. I'm happy take matter developed it. Lol, barely half year Covid, barely gotten started yet. past tense? Isn’t still?

I half expect government don’t mind elderly generally net drain country. Never mind built decades wealth, they’re putting ice flow go. cannot agree more.  paid $65 antibodies test May. LabCorp saw coming mile away. took four weeks get results. That’s Reddit indicator rest world. website sub fearmongering, virtue signaling, echo chamber places morgues absolutely backed requesting freezer trucks. since apparently don’t believe news whatsoever, there’s obviously nothing convince you. obviously can’t convince care people hurt this. Stay safe hope don’t hurt someone else along way. Look growth curve past 90 follow next 30 - isn’t going down. don’t think fluke. growing - fast. fact reading good sign though. Hopefully that, us one them. need next year surviving day. 


Do realize crisis society/species? One grandpa's best friends among :'(. Wisconsin heartbreaking right now. 40 million shots = 20 million vaccinated people over. spring people would die get vaccination sit younger parts family. Probably hardly Yeah, we're partying tbh also normal hospitals beg people mask up, stay home, otherwise protect themselves? normal hospitals beg community ppe? normal elective surgery canceled en masse? US, tried denial COVID’s existence. surprised approach didn’t work. even close half population. sure every state, state definitely waived several residents' rights this. Leaving facility allowed medical reasons. Families allowed facility end life visits. wouldn’t air travel, I’m literally driving. don’t care get Covid. care spreading it. I’ve hyper vigilant avoiding people last week half. 

And haven’t symptoms symptomatic cases develop time. 

A symptomatic cases take care even less time.  true want get pissing contest, people learn feel motivated learn. people witnessed might know that.

I have. goes pissy ass-umption. Fuuuuuuck pain meds. Worst headaches damn life coming things. Holy shit. Never life much pain, 100X worse chest pain surgery, minor. I'll fulfill guy's promise upvote you. Name Rose great novel scene makes sense context. we're also fat fuck Thought* Welcome back, missed things less appealing trapped boat 3000 people diarrhea. sister worked small facility wisconsin, weeks ago. Apparently one employee, 7th hour 8 hour shift, stated roommate family member it, well passed 5 employees, sister one them. sister stopped going felt sick, wanted get tested, fired said working anyway. sister said residents, seems whoever's charge care one bit long they're covering shifts. even getting 2 weeks pay cares act, due fired, know legally go it. cheeseheads fucked up. I’m seeing 500 hours online. Regardless fact, curriculum still completely off-topic. I’m saying aren’t good nursing programs, good lot unstandardized churn qualified medical workers. almost medical school remotely unstandardized rigorous. Likewise, similar stories BSN programs well, FNP, RN, whatever title. regulation standardization there. 

Colleges realizing start shitty nursing program give degree pretty much cost, students still come droves much healthcare demand is. That’s many nursing programs odd online colleges nobody’s heard of, turnover rate high. 

The clinical hours also large point too. Even using number, don’t think 2300 hours anywhere close number hours needed one practice independently. That’s like one year clinical experience. Premeds know experience that. Can't help prioritized people wore masks time? Deniers get second resources available. guess would motivate wear damn masks. begging understand Japanese culture It'll thaw pretty damn fast arm already lol im you! cut long time friend mine wife got face screaming little kids cant get it.  long time friend 10 years. changed number all, havent heard since happened june. fuck em. Nurses idiots too. obviously rank listen rapidly spreading virus one rung bum street. don’t get wrong rung, I’m listening people forefront field. can’t imagine nurse working pandemic recommending mask wearing. literally can’t hurt anything. make personal choice wear mask. build wall make pay Bottom line think adenovirus route whether chimp human great specific pandemic. We’ve already seen data two mRNA vaccines look excellent. People argue safety mRNA vaccines new prior knowledge bits mRNA probably less impact injecting whole virus you. would say table 1 safe fuck Yet useless temperature checks still happening offices right masks come off.  using name mean whole new administration.

The red team would better getting check passed Georgia two leading charge Unless Ontario half lockdown measures dumb experience close. Let's fuck economy never get grip virus.. even vaccinated contract virus, period time infection immunity system wins virus effectively contagious, may never know catch it. lot mask mandates likely stay place result enough population vaccinated virus isn’t able spread easily. There's definitely pros cons this. may think company greedy employees (bottom line). true potentially helping system well. freezer probably going give vaccine employees free charge. know expensive American healthcare system be. Also makes convenient employees get vaccine. book appointment take day get vaccine. con obvious hospitals might enough freezers due limited supply. Restaurants people. I’m truly sorry restaurant owners workers impacted. sucks sucks less Long term care worker Arkansas. facilities locked way. We've wearing masks times months. Constant staff meetings remind us wear masks up, wash sanitize hands time, PPE, etc. Rules changed added frequently, too. 

We really well months. couple resident positives handful staff positives. Weekly testing everyone, rapid testing available anyone fails screening (temp symptom check front door) residents symptoms. month ago, rapidly changed. Night weekend staff following proper procedures. wearing masks properly, eating nurses' desks, etc. 1 2 positives week became 5-10 positives. started testing frequently, still getting ahead cases. third residents positive, deaths spiking, struggle staff shortages there's many staff positives. 

We've also gone HEROES April treated quite poorly. State funded hazard pay ended June. We're blamed higher ups frankly unavoidable situation given circumstances. Stressed overworked, pressure fuck smallest ways (like adjusting mask without washing hands after), worried we'll take Covid home loved ones, worried we'll infect residents coworkers. Leadership piss poor toxic. 

I've started looking jobs outside healthcare industry. proves Bloomberg biased, unreliable news source. Ford tends corporation Michigan. Ford GM significant investment state's wellbeing tend decent corporate citizens. I'm sure Ford sure vaccinate staff suppliers first - that's significant percentage population near facilities surprise see use facilities drive thru vaccination places like Dearborn (Detroit), Flint, Lansing, etc. fact, somewhat expect that. people think getting thousands nurses china help US hospitals? Oleander, toxic fuck yep exorcism no. people make decisions whether pause degrees. many people want finish start careers. public health risk online schooling it’s personal decision don’t quite understand hullabaloo is. previous work always paid innoculations require work (Hep B booster, travel vaccinations, flu shot). It’s like, bonus part working them. also said they’d cover stuff like quarantine times (but never needed technically year way worked lol).

A lot vaccination take driven business needs, sucky sounds. Universities require them, health care aged care, also child care workers too. There’s heaps precedence ohhhhh soooooo close. CLOSE. imagine grief passed virus someone knew closely due blasé. would terrible thing live with. know something fake without knowing is?

If really wanted push argument, could even say *if knew claiming cure was, still able say fake*. revealed hydroxychloroquine, colloidal silver, bleach, whatever, like could confidently say ""yeah, know cure covid"", he's medical researcher exhaustively studied exact thing bunch covid-positive patients.

On flip-side, sent spam get-rich-quick scheme tell is, would think I'm full BS even without knowing get-rich-quick scheme was? think could still pretty confident full it, even know selling. debt forgiveness fair

Student debt forgiveness incredibly unfair, say someone would greatly benefit. shame small businesses provided sufficient help government. mean know big corporations come fine small hit local small businesses ones truly struggling even make amazing Trump could get voters move different planet could stupid without affecting normal people's lives? truly believe people wear masks think exceptional genes one people needs hospital, therefore think would persuade them. Although wish something could done show preferential treatment victims instead perps. “Freedom,” though. Lots lots “freedom” sloshing around. masks, nothing stops anyone gathering “freedom” alarming faces, putting wallets. 

So. Much. Freedom. per dose.

&amp;#x200B;

Pfizer - $20

Moderna $10-50

AZ - Dumb excuses. federal government warned January. Trump tape admitting fact downplayed threat. So, administration pretended control botched testing, failed pick spread. That's nobody knew anything March. Everyone intentionally misled. Stop revisionist garbage. lived it. plasma another one treatments got emergency authorization like hydroxychloroquine? issue lockdown raging, COVID. COVID cause people get evicted, government policy consumer confidence do. I'm sure. miss lot press conferences. Possible though. Another example best response countries relied standard public health practices rather hoping miracle cure. Loaded question. You’re anti-vax. federal government ironically even remotely reflect American culture. I'm antivax means, I'm gonna definitely wait months observe side effects keep wearing mask distancing meantime. There’s full time jobs available man.

I feel struggle. gig work sell plasma. Times tough. let fool replying upset you. understand struggle.  live Wisconsin confirm train wreck. hospitals packed still get crap wearing mask staying home much can... explains lot got bad here. like pre-covid Black Friday week Target Hobby Lobby (yes, yarn essential purchase staying home lol). go: Ford already captive audience tens thousands people (their workforce). difficult imagine local clinic able use equipment efficiently. trying corner market freezers. actually sounds like less would ultimately need. Whole foods continues confirmed COVID-19 cases within employees. last recent COVID-19 confirmed cases are: November 08, November 21, November 24.

They counting/regulating capacity people enter store. 

Employees receiving text confirmed cases notified came contact person. No. year left bachelors software engineering. I'm tired poverty. I'm ready graduate get there! live rural America I’m surprised. People around brainwashed minor inconvenience life socialism end America know it. mean kill coronavirus pathogens, yes. 6k. also heard bars north packed deer hunters. : / Good. Shut dining/drinking establishments resolved. people currently believe climate change still believe even impacts them. Climate change slow gradual process handle emotionally. point data proving homes destroyed due climate change they'll chalk freak weather event disaster, say that's things always been. come around they'll say climate change man-made. people simply cannot helped... Wait canada secured doses vaccines? would thought they'd atleast doses secured December/January flag print even. ""We're wearing get airport onto plane, gaiters coming second we're wheels up."" Oof, I've going doctor fairly often since beginning everyone wearing masks, screenings, checking temperatures. least Wisconsin dope medical care. Ugh happened one friends! graduated year theater degree totally fucked. think site accurate tbh. 50% chance 10 person gathering would mean ~1/20 people random population infected COVID. Either a) statistic true significantly less b) disease literally issue 5% population c) disease sucks spreading.

Also keep mind confirmed COVID positive individual included population (and honest sick people) isolated. I'm sorry, slow stupid person, help lol. know soap water kills COVID hands, want assume logic holds clothes washer. FWIW, article says they’re considering shortening 14 days 10 days. stupidity people never fails amaze could pay fair share taxes. one thing Ford VAST VAST facilities.. 

with HUGE parking lots 

that.. apparently freezers.

***does matter go get jab?***

... could EASILY see 

&amp;#x200B;

employees + families - friends.. even local parts suppliers families.. good.. live area - Ford vaccinating town.. happens people something Ford.

&amp;#x200B;

Ford known corporate dickhead.

**Ford Motor Company Manages Ethics Social recall stores covid hot-zones Big Auto companies.. you? food companies.. sure.. auto assembly workers IIRC.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd rather Ford buy Tyson chicken. current case rate, that's pretty much trajectory, yes... need law policy enter private establishment. scrap masks anyway getting vaccine. point I'm making money past limited SSI parents get that

Are me? :0

Cause barely get SSI, lol, that's income...

And yeah, really leave help grandma see therapist Yh pretty much pandemic end. we've got vaccines started roll large majority population covid cases probably decrease drastically point manageable much deal. Also, everyone wonderful one way another. Well, everyone.  Simple variety says everyone each, saints daemons. point whole pandemic political issue. think police involved. lockdown event national emergency. Changing reason mortality flu covid valid reason closing businesses creating massive economic depression it? media going government saving us all, give break. mention fact thousands people die cancer treated covid nonsense. Cancer patients small chance survival treated. 1 10,000 healthy people die covid, mass hysteria mind boggling kids got tested 3rd time today. Can’t go school type cold, they’re home cold, need either 14 day quarantine negative test return. We’ve getting tested hospital pediatrician- hopefully they’ll continue covering least part cost. There's also fact 100 million people risk age underlying condition single one skeptics proposing massive plan isolate months food, housing, income, etc detail. purely underdeveloped excuse expose others. short term long term side effects multiple vaccine? anti-vax generally want know. make sure keep six feet you. People might trust Fauci FDA Operation Warp Speed Same. retail job right still feel bad people worse me. degree theatre industry 100% fucked people get shit together goes away. anyone surprised this? Well yh probably able fully end covid19. We'll probably still get se cases covid19 every year vaccines work well I'm sure we'll able bring covid19 manageable levels majority population protected return normal life. words it'll longer pandemic basically Hoaxers Reddit dedicated thing pretend real? know man. Seems likely. 🤔 parents covid 4 weeks ago. brother roommates parents want us come Thanksgiving. already it, brother live together one else, there's pretty much 0 potential spread, right?

Try thinking another way: haven’t tested anyone North Dakota all. useful contribution conclude data cases North Dakota? Antimaskers murderers. Change mind. Best place - home

I would like stay connected industry somehow, least near future. Today got callback local air cargo carrier potential positions submitting application last night. able reach HR getting voicemail fingers crossed tomorrow. promising lead far! 

Also, help notice username...O-H! everyone wasn’t vitamin deficient.   

80% severe covid cases deficient vitamin D.  (1)

There statically error amounts vitamin calculated, current RDA vitamin 600IU, re-examining data 8,995IU.  (2)

You also need take Vitamin Vitamin K, take lunch breakfast food, fat soluble.  

Don’t take lunch, vitamin impact melatonin produced, take late day really mess sleep cycles.

Therefore allocating deaths would happened anyway covid deaths: flu, pneumonia, etc classed covid deaths. 
If doesn’t tell something I’m sure anything will. 
And ‘N95 tested masks’ around then. said ‘it gradually went away’ thing too. didn’t special vaccine either way. 
Overstated flu that’s is. none it’s gone. empathy stretched beaten submission. Oh it’s cool make racist jokes not. Screw even fake restrictions place anymore. one state enforcing mask mandate actual restriction businesses. Let’s accelerate among Europe tried protect elderly everything had, social security free FFP2s regular rapid antigen tests. failed massively, completely logical given viral load half-life.

So way this:

- partying.
- unnecessary contacts.

This drives cases down, care homes need lockdowns. months vaccines roll out. really want google, Facebook, Instagram, twitter arbiter free speech? Oh mean covid official test, official COVID death. sure, let’s say fuck every man right? highest toll since march 28

Only March 28 27 higher daily death toll looks like they'll break easily. much enjoy trolling? Please describe covid affected time spend it. Well, that's theory. see case counts start actually dropping that's remnant testing issues, Thanksgiving, factors. little early tell point. Unfortunately everyone sense sucks more. decisions trade offs many decided would suck miss family gatherings higher potential risk infecting infected Covid.  That’s great math though

By math slightly less 1 Fallopian tube.

It’s great driving home point needs made, it’s bad math. can't believe people think N95 means blocks 95% viral material.

Simple answer: block 95% relevant particles.

Even simpler explanation: wearing N95 mask, can't easily breathe orange, right? object (respiratory droplets / particulate) large enough, completely prevented passed material. 

5% relevant particles *smaller mask filter*. state reported three digit death toll first time today. constant drum beat awful. that’s true grocery stores work, imagine weddings, groups friends, bars, etc fully masked whole time, think that’s spread happens.  whole point first lockdown give hospitals time expand capacity, do. deaths cases recorded roughly 3 weeks ago also. average deaths might 2500-3000 mid December. crazy thing math point everyone country caught one left infect. barely knew Fantastic freedom choose dies terms. I’m loving able hide face world

The real motivation “masks forever” crew 😂 know point was. I’m saying wasn’t point here. think missed point again. Yes, understand that’s whole story imagine that’s people downvoted.

but downvote presenting data? comment think data put better context?

and information testing capacity issues anyway? honest, timeline mess won’t reschedule yet.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* workers tend majority infected (from read)

I'm doubting all, sources numbers I'm curious see that. know healthcare workers increased risk obvious reasons expect majority infected. really hope side effects flu shot seems worse. meningitis vaccine koed 24 hours. Qantas require it’s actually available. Currently everyone quarantine anyway. *but prolonged New York City-style collapse.*

Counter-intuitively, less measures take fight COVID, faster go away. South North Dakota proven - 1/3 residents already infected case count starting collapse despite zero effective measures place. thing is, ULTRA cold. -94 f. last like month regular fridge temps, totally fine initial rollout. That's gonna problem 3rd world areas, big deal send mobile cold distribution trucks areas. Christmas going rough Well old comorbitities Don’t worry run testing capacity sooner sound like really close family🙂 best childhood memories parents playing tea party, playing store, hide seek, puppet shows etc. parents played us kids time growing I'm grateful, passed wonderful childhood memories parents playing me. daughter remember nothing important parents her; fostered imagination tough times come throughout life(as us all) memories keep strong. already nearly high Europe: Hungary today 4,013 US equivalent deaths, Italy 4,691 US equivalent deaths, Poland 4,698 equivalent deaths, Austria today 4,330 US equivalent deaths, Belgium 11/21 4,368 US equiv deaths, Belgium 11/22 4,760 US equivalent deaths---Worldometers Case Tracker adjusted population differences might better health limit TV news watching. Also I'm sure context statement, although expert could worded things better. Thst sounds like someone antivax. people like 1000s die. getting vaccine soon available save lives. think greater access contraceptives population would drop pretty well. Many young people days want kids, least want wait til late 20s up. mean? :) realize insane sounds? 

I said 1) feel obligation read understand medications take 2) feel responsibility educate risks instead expecting someone else do. 

I basically described good medical consumer - equivalent reading fine print materials accompany medication RX.

To cut chase, wrote ""I wholly support vaccination"" ""I get all.""

You're simultaneously rude ignorant. bout say ""Slackers"" sit cabin wonder “is sea sickness Covid nausea? Covid diarrhea typical cruise ship virus diarrhea?” 

Either way, they’re Americans they’re going pop Imodium head pool bar.  realize happening hospitals road too? think least one week ""Vietnam"" every day. lightning fire I’m not. Explain like I’m 5. Guess problem hosting conspiracy theory fruit-loops. cases written anxiety/stress likely. older? We've never stopped wars making new veterans suffer idiots sufficiently large quantities ever get bad enough. suffer much never got far.

I time go beach job. hospital. Downstairs office sharing connecting door Covid-19 testing lab. done year. Emirates Qantas code share. likely going require well. unless hold Australian passport likely need prove vaccination enter Australia anyway. Unless want quarantine 2 weeks. Australia fuck around comes stuff. unlocking early! need remain homes next 6 months least. Senate deserves much credit POTUS. POTUS helmed messaging, Senate failed act. People prepared what's coming. Two things accounted for:

1. Seasonality. Yes, begun, scales order magnitude least end December. Way cases people think occur, severe, able catch situations summer.
2. hospitals full, become unfull. already almost full everywhere. Want accomplish 3%, 5% IFR? zero hospital care available millions cases.

I guess ""just living lives without fear"" looks like. Nope, all. RN works COVID patients, I’ve seen young grads come hospital, see fucked leave. isn’t like aren’t educated enough recognize don’t require protection, us choose put it. point. returning RN chose work, knowing risks, especially age, also choice.  extremely frustrating states getting first NYs stricter guidelines. Thst could life family members life massive pissing contest governor current president. people lose. New Yorkers. I’d probably try lab grown human meat means prion disease Also crowdfunding going, lot rancid people do. Probably survival rate high. It’s worth effort expense. Precisely. Also, sibling immunocompromised risk she’s like “if get get it”. Make make sense pleaaaaaase. Naa... drink that.. Guess agree narrative. true... empty homes? like next 2 weeks hope new Bugatti end year 2020 like strongest proof failings American individualism.

The idea American individualism everyone rational actor left devices rational people make right choice without government needing tell so.

Coronavirus handily disproved assumption. see people perfectly fine walk whole body scanner, surrender electronics allow invasive body searches complain wearing mask horrendous attack freedoms. Even worse evidence masks work far tell terror attacks actually prevented airport security theatre taking belt shoes allowed 100ml 
You'd think people would least realize *some* irony yelling freedoms required wear mask.

I'm sure airport least handful people per day right yelling ""their rights"" taking shoes walk body scanner. that's I've gotten mine. Plus try buy places obviously make masks themselves, ship overseas. figure I'm helping small business owner I'm starting really wonder this. I'm sure folks know risks. 

If spend time sitting alone nursing home, really going afraid dying spending good time entire family?

What's alternative? 3-year long slow death nursing home?? never really understood 14 day recommendation vs 10 day. Vast majority people become symptomatic within 10 day time frame. It’s possible virus take long 14 days incubate it’s rare. testing accurate within 10 day time frame. Relevant top post LifeSite’s channel suspended YouTube. Watch videos here. kidding? Cui bono? imagine Trump supporters would've packed streets celebrating? People would've lost shit. work full time job teacher putting effort. get paid buy things need enjoy family. longer option wouldnt put effort job all. youngish healthyish odds good fine. 

Just safe though, dont already pulse ox something else monitor oxygen levels home get one asap. MIL discharged hospital (with virus) vitals perfectly normal symptoms improved significantly staying one night. Two days later checked oxygen habit going sleep got reading 84 (near organ failure level), despite feeling completely fine. went back hospital three days discharged again, time oxygen tanks stay hooked 2 weeks. told gone sleep night would woken up. That's broke several counties, using rates them. think bad math reason people tend stay home feel well, absolute number cases county going upper bound. Thank you. husband would say ""there's worse things sea"" fine, try another opening get cross current going Unbelievable. Literally unbelievable. ""saving"" Christmas, ensuring group people see next Christmas. stay home Thanks Giving better ICU Christmas. pandemic fuled people thinking strangers COVID. wear masks stores go friends houses take off. Chicks dudes dude. Exercise made pain worse, sadly. army took it. lay everytime got home much pain. Changed medication, made pain manageable. hold breathe. mean embarrassment? It'll happen. mid December. Remember, trust US right thing... screwed tried everything else. What? wonder leads better care benifits surviving VA, kind playing russian roulette. keep miss work every time exposed, make money. Even vaccine simply reduces severity, companies win cover extended ICU care healthplans.

It's no-brainer, opinion, large companies buy cold storage vaccinate employees. ban ridiculous. Restaurants responsible around 3% covid cases LA. time, there's plan bail industry employees(like me). Newsom expects everyone tough out. 

A months ago Newsom paid Chinese company $1 billion make covid masks. company never made masks before. one mask delivered yet. billion dollars could gone long way keep people afloat, are. 2100 deaths today. Wake people stay home...this heartbreaking. Interesting, know that, thank information. people know personally relieved bother unpleasant extended family year. Depends process get inoculated state community spread time. RIP BNO.

The mods massacred lmfao. mean really work way, really bad regardless. ""No one gets rich, one dies. ""

lol that's true, bad FAA President shut air travel. Unfortunately, outgoing one busy golf course &amp; incoming one get sworn Jan. idea much pains me. One couple know literally cheating break good baby way  Johnson Johnson one? ctv article:

We've got people want experience paying normal Disney/Vegas/bar experience, somebody meet need!  people allowed ask questions now? guy said didn’t need wear mask already got COVID?

The obvious problem logic anyone could *claim* COVID get wearing mask. Shit, good time work Ford People self-conscious care Thanksgiving 14-day quarantine meeting grandparents. tough done. Essentially per capita deaths. Around 5% less. lol, S#@# ur right. Health officials refused work half country, shocked half country responds kind.

Anyone selfish enough try hurt kill immediate family and/or parents something could easily postpone, ain't family.
And lets forget infects lot people self-indulgence fest people go hospital, he's putting hospital workers family's lives risk something health experts around country warning people do...again again. 
I've heard story story entire families getting infected self-absorbed garbage. 
Whatever....all say feel really fortunate family have. Good luck that. mentality Americans risk reward? worth effort curtailing way life 90% people 1% would die 9% might long term issues.

I feeling mortality rate 20%, maybe Americans would pay attention. really way convince otherwise vaccines way. responsible prior holidays? I’m saying people things like obeying distancing, wearing masks, etc. probably won’t suddenly stop _they_ get vaccine themselves, small portion people. Though, I’m sure there’s outliers. knows pandemic. Invites vulnerable group need travel. Sounds like smart guy. Maybe dumb question would best use another ""stimulus"" bill dump money ramping production vaccines direct consumer payments bailouts, etc? Idiots, selfish, self-absorbed, ignorant smart people.

Translation :

What cause Hailian Cold Storage (epidemic)? November 17, received notification Dezhou City, Shandong Province received batch imported German pork knuckles transferred Tianjin Port Dezhou City, outer packaging positive nucleic acid. Following line, conducted full investigation Hailian Cold Storage, investigation found Case 138 Case 139. cases occurred Hailian cold storage. Conceptually, everyone thinks frozen product passed them, details.

&amp;#x200B;

The source infection case 139, transmitted him? epidemiological investigation, found things two people came contact different. Case 138 unloading worker. goods unloaded pork knuckles tested positive Texas. Case 139 driver. goods transported North American pig heads, never transported German pork knuckles.

&amp;#x200B;

At time, thought, one exposed pork knuckle exposed pig heads. crossover them. case 139 infected? check see pig's head contaminated? Unfortunately, since pig heads sent out, stock Hailian Cold Storage, way conduct inspections pig heads.

&amp;#x200B;

Who passed ""thing"" Case 139? doubt. case 138, contact, case 138 passed 139? current tune shows two know contact all, people another suspect.

&amp;#x200B;

The pig's head pork knuckle placed warehouse. pig's knuckle contaminates pig's head. driver transports pig's head infected? information provided us Liu Tiao like this: pork knuckles stored cold storage No. 4, pig heads transported away door cold storage No. 6, means two intersection. One related cold storage No. 4. One related cold storage No. 6, completely different.

&amp;#x200B;

Deciphering source infection case 139 requires in-depth epidemiological investigation. epidemiological investigation, collected videos cold storage looked suspicious points. sorted main reason infection case 139 .

November 4th storage day Hailian Cold Storage. Three batches goods shipped Hailian Cold Storage different times day. First all, please take look picture. green marks 6 cold storages, light-colored underneath work table cold storage, buffer zone. part room temperature. November 4, three shipments arrived Hailian Cold Storage. German pork knuckles. shipped Warehouse No. 4. also two batches pig heads. two batches pig heads shipped morning afternoon. One batch pig heads arrived. No. 2 library, batch working platforms passed No. 4 library placed No. 5 library, next No. 4 library. Pork knuckle pig head share working platform.

&amp;#x200B;

The key person mentioned stevedore. case No. 138, moved pork knuckles warehouse. time, also handled pig heads entered warehouse 2, pig head stevedores warehouse 5 not. Carry unloading.

&amp;#x200B;

November 5 day delivery. German pork knuckle came work platform No. 4 warehouse. unloading worker still No. 138 case. key point moved pig heads No. 2 warehouse, next day same. Wearing clothes, wearing gloves, without disinfection, continue leave pig elbow. possible that, Dezhou, Shandong, positive test outer packaging pork knuckle caused contamination clothes gloves workers.

&amp;#x200B;

There also batch pig heads warehouse day. two warehouse overlapped hour, Case 138 participate pig heads, warehouse Gate 6. pig's head stored warehouse No. 5 came warehouse No. 6. want mention truck driver. truck driver participate handling pigs entire transportation process. get infected? checked video found big breakthrough. process leaving pig's head, outer packaging pig's head fell apart, pig's head layer plastic film rolled ground. driver participated picking pig's head. picked pig's head put away. Go back car, exposed pig's head. also explain source infection 139 cases, indeed pig heads.

&amp;#x200B;

In incident, source infection identified North American pig heads, contaminated German pork knuckle caused positive German pork knuckle packaging. evidences. collected specimens pig heads scattered, nucleic acid test positive, sequencing time exactly gene sequencing 139 cases.

&amp;#x200B;

From this, confirm epidemic North American pig heads source infection, causing No. 138 participate removal pig heads (infection), driver No. 139 participated picking pig heads (infection), exposed pig heads.

&amp;#x200B;

We still porter’s resting place, three-bed sheets tested positive new coronavirus nucleic acid. situation source infection entire epidemic situation Hailian Cold Storage. basically confirmed closed. fascinating conversation Hope Moderna AstraZeneca joining also big supply going Feb/March. yet follow science deniers. sure people downvoting think you’re racist what... probably could used context.

Skin higher melanin density inhibits production vitamin D, shown possibly cofactor recovery effects disease.
This could contributor COVID mortality rates higher ethnic groups higher melanin content. 

Couple job done entirely indoors, would make logical sense predisposed decreased vitamin production spend lot time indoors, would possibly higher risk.

Ethnic differences IMPORTANT medicine. don’t care you’re black, white, Hispanic, Filipino, damn important know genetic makeup plays role diseases....  can't live fear stop life!!!

Lol, talk mentally weak. England seems similar vaccination plan. going tough time April. Vaccine doorstep, deep winter people stop caring. cases like Republican Senate demands employers blanket immunity for. refuse consider Covid relief bill immunity businesses. told grocery meat safe! eating pig heads raw? mostly need new restrictions lockdowns people follow masks, distancing, etc though. 100% mask compliance, social distancing, hygiene measures, decent testing + tracing infrastructure, lockdowns needed except initial real info virus. activities would inherently dangerous lockdowns really needed unless let virus run rampant. So? time corporate greed common good goal.  I'm making full thanksgiving dinner trimming inviting everyone sharing me....me. Good..
When began wasn’t masks, hell, even shook head people wear them. time went put one on, wore to, wore gas station grocery store. Today, wear one like seatbelt became norm part daily routine. mention SAVE LIVES. everyone would listen would much easier severe not, someone like you! landphobic seen Europe data? Months mask mandates went affect, booming cases, across board. ""extreme mindset"" make difference here?  honestly believe this? Seriously? 

I know US hate hard strong sub good lord 😳 virus spreads faster vaccinations distributed

That's Plague Inc taught me! California joke state. Absolute hell hole, can’t wait see fail.  enforce people start threatening us higher ups nothing really choice. Money problem here. still need highly trained people manufacture it, raw materials take time trained people produce. Throwing money might help somewhat, diminishing returns. sure. 

FYI, unique Covid vaccine. detailed information ‘pig head’ link: Look number vaccines effects expressed within first months. remember FDA made companies wait two months second shot submit EUA.

I understand- I'm sarcastic- many us vaccines kinda magic, much wifi even electricity is. get that. idea injected something ten years road die heart exploding simply correspond modern medical science. Especially vaccine science. IL last week, 1% people testing positive day. average person contagious 10 days, means 1/10 people contagious. money, would pay hear fuckery. Unbelievable. Yeah, folks understand wanting wear masks folks. 

I know someone quit big box store required employees wear upset much wear really work anyway. 

It seems like sad situation. government done us could safely stay home. Oh, see trust mega corporations right thing now?

Fucking lol.  know they’ll find way shit people. Back summer delay form death reporting 7 days, according CDC's historical data, I'm sure became much longer fall. doctor, health care. totally ignorant. Heard vaccines specific conditions must transported stored at. talk freezers. hard morons understand death rate, rate infection health system completely overwhelmed (which, news flash, already is) national news source billionaire funded.

Counterpoint: name national news source blatantly partisan propaganda way aligns patrons' interests. Wow, came yourself? go work NewsMax

Meng arrested 2 years ago, China going link vaccines would even agree work Canada begin with? need work plot holes

What actually happened Canada going work China running Phase 3 trials, like Brazil, Indonesia, etc China domestic cases test on. ""payment"" trial Canada gets priority shipment Chinese vaccines license produce want.

Then someone Canada US realized company they're working linked Chinese military, oh nos, butt hurt commence, Canada pulled P3 even started. Oh point Canada going produce it, P3 even start.

Just like forced arrest Meng, Canada forced ditch Chinese ""military"" vaccine put eggs US basket instead, lo behold, ""America First"" Trump fucks Canada again.  I’m right you. Well, safe six feet away. essentially, I’m right you. I'm California basically entire state purple-tier people still wear masks man. Oh sure, instant. Like reverse turkey thermometer. Suddenly they're gone. American? n:1 expected high 6 7? seems quite high me.

It's reasonable pin 5, since factors:

* Upwards 40% COVID cases completely asymptomatic end-to-end, people would reason even get tested part case count point;
* 80% symptomatic cases *mild* symptoms, could feel well enough social events; and
* *All* cases period time they're non-symptomatic contagious which, average, little longer long they're symptomatic. True. I'm booking live band anything. itl easy switch dates. that's target.

It's fucked situation sure. almost like everyone you. See says two studies include data 200 countries?

Stop saying “look data” actually give evidence argument. Yea lot good test us overload labs already taking 10-12 days get us results time get back didn’t matter anyway. You’d get really long thin attachments sell vacuums .

Honestly falls crack maybe stick hand don’t worry much . Ha, take stroll /r/collapse. place *the* wet blanket COVID-19/political news. died flu US far year. flu vaccine enough. often effective.""

""The best practice get vaccinated, properly wear flu masks time contact people, change become damp breath, avoid touching face hands wash hands frequently."" 

- Nov 25th 2019. 15 days first case covid Wuhan. Freedoms diseased liberals! tread muh rights! Communists, socialists (doesn't passport never left states) Day four worst terms overall feeling, day five lost senses smell taste. Day 12 senses began return. biggest reason facemasks panacea article claims people wear public. don't, won't, wear private.

In city, mask adherence basically 100%. Hell, even see homeless dudes adhering facemask rules time. wild. come everyone says masks save us all. true. still cases. Even ardent facemask wearers among us (myself included) wear facemasks families, friends, etc... know single person broken COVID social distancing least once. I'm talking month movie night ""okay I'll join 6 person Halloween get-together."" events never include masks, matter them. Everyone COVID deniers infectious disease epidemiologists ditching mask soon public spaces.

Yes write article like one study showing masks block particles. do. going stop infecting roommate, go ""safe"" get-together infect people group, infect roommates, etc... 

Masks blunt transmission pods. help stay safe public transit stores, extremely helpful. However, effective resolve wearing them. None us prepared 100% mask-on life. meaning sound dismissive. experiences mixing panic attacks asthma attacks. gonna it, neither others.  I'm London. We're equally fucked. least we're TRYING curb fighting lockdowns much. Read translation. Tianjin authority job tracing virus pig head. Pig head considered staple food poor China.

Have nice day. wife works hospital. Prior covid, told hospitals reach bed capacity the’ll divert hospitals. usually happened around influenza season. Covid different Gov. Ducey required hospitals create emergency plans enact said emergency plans. Emergency status allows hospital omit standard protocols doubling hospital beds room. wife said week hospital works at, added 2nd bed rooms could, anticipate need. clue make word salad...

Edit: think (hope) sarcastic???

Edit again: lol okay pretty sure sarcastic. yes, sounds right! value $ people.

That's exactly it. first world countries paid people stay home. People felt sense duty entitlement paid stay home. 

The United States government abandoned people used virus opportunity accumulate wealth gatekeep. killed competition gentrified small businesses upcoming neighborhoods. 

All know tax day April 2021 going hit different. aware pandemic? trying dismissive normal times. focus containing disease obviously failing it. I've plenty concerts, games, carnivals, etc days. Nine months without make life over. means find things rather lamenting can't do.

I've enjoyed plenty streamed concerts time. hate almost much anti-hermits. Driving death machines, touching everything spreading disease things. Anti-hermits cause death anti-maskses vaxxers combined. Wouldn’t surprised coastal states poach significant amounts nurses Midwest get paid normal annual salaries 2 months, get housing, solid amount PPE baker contracts. sad internet allows people need serious help find people make believe behavior normal. Hey lately. Masks face shields work making freak leave feeling like can't breath. Still wearing one whole 12 hour shift every day. people still get simple concept? Stay safe. Good luck you. exactly people ignoring. FDA even approved reviewed submitted data. ""Well ready second week December"" ""Well enough 50 million people Spring"" mean diddly FDA approves this.

Yeah, probably going approve it, never guarantee. making statements like reviewed approved. mean, asking rush distribution without extensive testing study periods normally applied something like this, mention companies basing research barest minimum test subject, barely crossed threshold review periods. first it’s masks don’t make difference, it’s people aren’t wearing times outside immediate households. go restaurants, go bars, go private parties. That’s universal mask-wearing public. course cases go up. good step. Wish they’d Fox Snooze. sure, I'd love see equal turnout first one I'd settle anything close Probably half casualties we'd still giving back Taliban right now. ISIS probably happened, Iraq Iran probably start bigger regional war collapse Syria still. ""Don't live fear! BTW, also 39 semi automatic weapons, never leave house without bullet proof vest on, call cops blacks buying Spongebob bars ice cream truck!"" Project Baseline released, last five days, new authorization documentation took wording charge. anymore...  less. Wrong, cases people catching covid still work. Reddit hates social interaction period. Lol It’s religion, trains open fantastical claims without evidence MUH rights! That’s capitalism years ftfy Yes! Exactly! viral problem per se sick society blames problems everything everyone themselves. came back neg rash went away prescription steroids Yes. post main account 15 days first case Covid telling people wash hands wear masks time they're public prevent spread flu.

I've wearing flu masks time go public years. Hopefully Bad troll  problem. example stopped store. manager said kid RN nearby. Hospital full, shipping people out. manager appreciative wearing mask respectful. happy share info. People dont need go busting hospitals.  That’s reassuring mind instantly goes grandpa died summer nursing home. 

Because Covid couldn’t last hours hospice nurses nursing home staff true angels. know complex scenario.. First we've got exhaustion susceptible pool, even small dents makes big transmissiblity impacts, holidays, brings gatherings.

Then geographic factor -- nationwide, hard say outbreak zones go remission, new outbreak zones kick off.

So yea.. used flat trajectory _really_ hard predict, basically works, FWTW. takes time, energy, money. One Sandy Hook parents destroyed Alex Jones, easy. Somebody’s gotta pay cant really call someone else bitter insecure defending someone wants hide face public. Thats basically definition kf insecure. Either? People applauding misinformation genuine form communication dangerous levels idiotic known yet support this! Well, conflating truth (information epidemiologists, virologists, peered reviewed research etc) misinformation total dumbasses. So, would problem Google shutting organizations known pedal misinformation? all. wish people generally fucking stupid can't tell difference obvious truths obvious lies, well... someone suppose.  hahaha lame. mate comments al post. sound like guy walks bar, makes moves chick rejects you, pretend never interested. Theres master plan here. idiot. Stand said man. dont weak like this. conviction. Two friends long haulers. Anecdotes incoming, physical markers show tests. going much harder write hypochondria. all.. curious... test positive? 

I've read rashes one symptom. multiple COVID-matching symptoms including three different types rashes little week ago. tested, redo test said problem result. So, still answer. hope silver lining painful year next decade research leads breakthrough save lives. vaccine doesn’t prevent contracting virus? DO? You’re confusing me. Reddit loves masks they’re anti social begin hide even world.  No, watched NYC burn ground June BLM. Turns out, nothing actually skill mastered. Especially bureaucratic corporate environments. redditors complain shit. talking about? AOC Ted Cruz exist government right now. think congress reflects diversity american population. One child immigrants worked normal job getting elected congress. Canadian pretending American. People ignoring safety guidelines mask wearing, gatherings, staying physically distant. still flocking churches, airports planning Holiday parties large numbers. Cases exploding almost every state. county 150 new cases today. likely stemming Halloween parties.

Many people seem care older people die, people nursing homes old. Many younger Covid patients could sent nursing homes long term complications get. someone young mean can't get virus like seasonal flu. Isis terror attacks direct result war terror. destroyed way life bombed 20 years. Pretty tough go school, get degree, start business. Eventually start get pretty mad people dropping bombs entire lifetime. Hes trolling, easy here. Low N, contradicts RCTs. Ignore move on. Former Rogan watcher. one thing liked show talk whole lot, anymore stance masks. obsession picking trans people. finds way bring damn near everyone. went casual idiot dangerous idiot. mad? mean, hell would believe rubbish. highly contagious water borne virus spread coughs simple talk stopped face masks! Ha rubbish. need foil hats actually spread Bill Gates via 5G towers, mean, better way prove invented teleportation infecting loads people virus. Talk cash in! oh ( /s) case stupid Ski masks aren’t designed restrict breath egress. Really, pretty sure laws martial law can't enacted. comment reads like soundbite someone flunked HS civics.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* many flew yesterday? We’re doomed Christmas. Sinopharm vaccine (or least first them). already approved emergency use UAE Bahrain, news comes surprise. might like society places lesser value people retirement homes, thats is

There medical ethical reasons gets organ age important consideration. Officials tell everyone stay home provide services help people need stay home.

If someone getting paid $7.25 hour interact hundreds people day also told seeing seven family members might kill probably going think sounds stupid. told daily work safe blown hazard pay. 

Without help, fucked. Shaming people going work. Helping people will. openly criticize government. Deal people downvoting this?! want young people dying covid? want locked economy destroyed line 6 hours get free, stale bread? wtf wrong people subreddit!? sadistic animals what? Oh, sure. I'll instruct staff try expel non-mask wearers, non-mask wearers kick fuss, call 911 wait 10 minutes irate client midst COVID induced mental breakdown beats living shit them. 

GFY, genius. 9/11 called cowardly state total war Al Qaeda. state total war Japan 1945. I'm little disappointed scroll three highly upvoted replies ""I know... OANN bad"" finding actual answer original question. think none approval yet, one knows one first. live southern Germany, many outbreaks like right now. tried implementing best protection available, course useless modes transmission sheer viral load disease.

No one seems care anymore, senicide become footnote local press.

I work home try contribute, sickens happening. CCP brigading CCP schill calling someone else brainwashed? Lmao oh irony think people understand that.

Mask orders kept place, even vaccinated, vast majority vaccinated. way could lifted sort ID card/bracelet proves vaccination status. right here. Companies really dont serve people dont want to. Anything else slavery.

Also, nice username, little bobby tables. Sanitize inputs. I'm perfectly sorry happening, seems like bad journalism sells much better good one... go that. change want see. live Springs yeah, many people nose out, wearing around neck. Constantly listen people ""How anyone sick? thought masks work (heavy sarcasm)"" yeah, dipshit, wear right! think Swede. topic brings online swedish mafia woodworks say ""Sweden never herd immunity policy"". True. healthcare worker I’m lucky one first thousands vaccinated U.S. hope people don’t difficulty getting vaccine becomes available wider public. decided use uninformed opinion truth despite evidence contrary? Okay then. Inrange, I'm sure channels actively demonetize bother it. know Jim Sterling actively monetize Jimquisition videos, Youtube monetizing Inrange despite that. suffered TBI too. Glad made it, safe Wonder downvoted.... lockdowns effective people make them. lot measures taken mitigate Rona poorly executed. Basically hear lot news, people lack practice. it’s going 9 months. Right wrong, huge part population done lockdown measures. basically makes irrelevant grand scheme thungs Please stop reading Facebook quotes. 
Just shows stupid are. 

Plus, need science prove masks works. common sense. 
You of... great is, yes, thanks. dont understand much stuff works, methinks.  know long term effects. first general availability mRNA product. So, could none, could tons (not likely). Mostly likely like vaccines -- small percentage something bad happen, vast majority fine.

Only time data tell though. Within Europe? Difficult, real borders lot cross border traffic necessary. longer infrastructure control cross border traffic meaningful way. Wow looks like amazing source headline pretty sums new restrictions. Pretty much nothing significantly slow spread virus. Meanwhile Spain planning vaccinate 2.5M people first three months. According plan, people 80 live nursing homes receive vaccine March. Common fucking sense Let try explain America’s problem socialized healthcare: it, black brown people going get well, can’t now, we? right points, agree completely. 

For example masks, really see effect masks infections. think assessment right reserve masks hospitals. message was, distance, need masks. 

I think testing biggest issue. testing infrastructure lacking. One important aspect production facilities rely buying stuff. problem can't solved easily.

Full country lockdowns effective, also lot negative effects. 

And real borders Europe, closing close impossible. Especially since need lot cross border traffic kinds purposes.

We're equipped kind event resources fix quickly. still can't open schools kids vaccines, towards end, since lowest mortality rates anyway. Best case Olympics full stands.... Worst case Olympics cancelled. I’m sure newsworthy    put perspective: Covid-19 killed Americans World War I, Vietnam War, Korean War Revolutionary war *combined*.

The conflicts still cost lives Covid-19 World War II (405,000 fatalities) Civil War (655,000 fatalities). sure effective That's people say, high pressure tactics really used Wuhan surrounding hot zones. rest country, China got COVID-19 control robust contact tracing, enforced quarantine, sanitization, social distancing. measures implemented developed nations, even western ones. 

Unless argument measures went fine say Germany even viably implementable US? posting things like improve credit score? care. deny problem exists fight proposed assistance people. good news you. Covid vaccine going effective OTC Motrin I'm worried people lying vaccinated cover lack wanting wear mask. know US Spain posted vaccine plan draft they're gonna vaccinate 2.5M people January March, vaccination . Considering rich countries planning vaccinate 0,5% population last two weeks December think they're either lowballing lot nations extremely positive? Totally. meltdowns going epic people don’t want remember ""militia group"" tried kidnap governor Michigan. thought already vaccine Yeah right. really think anyone would look recent European case rates, look care home ICU right now, believe article?

As said 1000 times before, lockdown last, extremely effective measure death widespread hospitals collapse.

What wrong people try make try convince people laughable bullshit like article? Get better stay silent. entire global medical scientific community pleading 8 months, government large portions STILL refuse right thing. actually hard believe reality really. Even Moderna, earlier mRNA cancer 2017 trials. first mRNA vaccine started July 2019 still Phase 1.

COVID-19 vaccines first time mRNA product gone phase 2 trials. questions it, rushed market, since normal clinical trials takes buy ""mentally exhausted"" angle.

I went shopping yesterday absolutely everybody wearing mask, 8 10 wearing noses. even chins.  long mask hanging chin nobody bats eye you.

Nobody fricking seemed ""exhausted"", people simply lazy and/or care. Never fuck UVC light unprotected. Consumer-available UVC lamps bound end poorly Well, sound charming. stressed. 

You call refuse leave thus scenario become problematic enough call them. know, way would work asked leave valid reason refuse to. simply use proper signage stating rules required patronize business refuse service wear one. Set precedent. ""scofflaws"" get set it. I'm sorry deal them. Wish politicians made mask thing political. makes virus spreading scenarios. costs lives.

Hope things get better guys please step back moment realize *everyone else* moron, maybe consider possibility may something moronic. make sense. mean vaccine passports it’s probably going happen Like 9/11 survivors national scale. Deny problem exists many already dead. love Hysterical. 

UAW workers best healthcare there. think auto makers keep going broke? understand wanted know test numbers are. UK testing 300k people day. France case numbers comparable not?  man either watching inrangetv value select, either way man That's literally social credit score works lol.   think do. Even subreddit people seem think promised doses 2021 going available like January rolling throughout whole year. 23675 new cases 507 new deaths. Lol apparently playing Red Dead Redemption 2 makes qualified know poisonous plants guys. say, I'd go healthcare workers first, along at-risk population (especially people assisted-living). school staff. students. grocery store workers &amp; front-line delivery service staff (if already fall previous categories). that, everyone else except super rich, get last. end, would slow down. pockets people get would probably someone concentrated, would still bad hotspots potentially showing up. whole week?! That’ll show them! judging post, thinks gone hill since Great Schism 1054, western eastern Catholic churches split ways.

The western church became Roman Catholic Church, eastern became Eastern Orthodox Church, though sometimes called Orthodox Catholic Church. driven mall lately BioNTech, company developed commonly known Pfizer vaccine, founded development personalized cancer treatments using mRNA technology.  lighthearted, test audiences hated ending made sense. Nvm, hate people. also cover long term side effects, obviously take time discover.

Hopefully since mRNA short usable lifetime, lead anything long term, need data find out. Finding good control group going hard consider non-control group probably less vaccines types. There's lots talk state lately add thousands beds surge capacity. There's also talk current hospitals short staff. know expect effectively staff additional beds enough people current count. really hundreds health care workers side lines waiting get tagged in? really doubt it. Services entered chat Excuse ignorance climate change covid happened Hong Kong extremely interesting. 

The day first case reported city, EVERYONE started wearing masks, common surfaces wiped hourly business. happened even though mask ban. Within week, nurses striking city government close boarder mainland China. 

Even without strong government policy, Hongkongers able get zero local cases. Following waves due loopholes government policy quarantines workers travelling city. 

The death rate stands 14 per million population one densely populated places world, US 802 deaths per million. 

Yes, government mandates save lives, requirement. one time 1200 dollar max check adjusted income 2018/2019 tax return depending filed. also received extra 600 dollars week unemployment benefits. also offered forgivable SBA loans small businesses help cover payroll. run out. almost impossible people get unemployment checks, state systems support influx. Unemployment help people like hours cut 5-10 week(I actually paying company pay periods cover health insurance). SBA loans covered 1 month company many small businesses get part stimulus package funded.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think saying making false dichotomy - choice lying doctors masks. Instead, government could got retail outlets like Amazon supermarkets withdraw masks sale directly supply essential workers ground. 

We know Plato's big mistake, lies (even ""noble"" ones) undermine institutions. confusion efficacy masks March April definitely fueled mask culture wars October November. would you. American deaths tragedies silly Yes, don’t know big divide government science. Remember people collapsing China streets early on? US cities pretty soon, mark words. Trader Joe's good too. limit number people inside reasonable number well. nice. shave lot more. KN95 don’t really work unless seal face. Whats uncivil lol person conversation mean, killed many Hiroshima Nagasaki still forgotten calling 9/11 cowardly act human history. wide-spread case brain fog among covid deniers. understand senior hours. There's still many seniors hours. family friend (also dentist) doing. Quarantining unless it’s emergency calls. :/ Always been. everyone knows. Isn’t saying “no signs” herd immunity slowing it? really sad world come this. Great idea. Maybe instead give two fours nails beat shit non-complying clients. red pocket CA. BLM strikes again? 😅 Half America. Ight gonna gang Yeah, well trying optimistic... misleading headline. article Swedish authorities never claim Sweden reached herd immunity. article implies Sweden reached herd immunity yet doesn’t help. sky falling. Leading people believe vaccines won’t work. get click, That’s way using language it’s ridiculously cynical use language. Shameful journalism. Theoretically, could carrier pass someone can't vaccinated, person dies. Hopefully case. News several vaccines people thinking pandemic day fuck it. 

I wish truth. Wow covid damage lungs may also damage heart. Causes myocarditis inflammation heart muscle. Sometimes mild not, cause chest pain, symptoms congestive heart failure cause sudden cardiac arrest leading death. actually caused first covid death United States, 57 year old woman thought flu covid back early February time testing severely limited. want hold vaccine available Yeah flying home seems pretty high risk right now. say someone lives 1800 miles family definitely willing take risk pandemic. parents also live area outbreak really bad lately I'd concerned getting exposed transit there. I'll spending December partner housemates. first Christmas alone least year good reason. comment backed plenty sources.  “I’m police, want it?”

The thing dont membership card...turn away. hard that? Fuck noise homie, get employee's bear mace.

Don't want wear mask? Bear mace.

Don't want leave asked to? Bear mace.

Don't want put item back instead plan leaving candy bars? Bear mace. last 10 minutes dude. speed run. Yeah really liked selection Costco stop going ones near filled rudest motherfuckers I've ever encountered. get it’s severe, I’ll nurse/doctor record phone upload social media. I’m fucking tired watching posts stories friends’ socials wearing masks, partying, going out, it’s infuriating. people need see consequences actions. contrast posts friends medical field sobering. nurse friend posted video recently full PPE hospital thousand yard stare shaky voice, saying she’s wasn’t even halfway shift already watched two people die day, begging people wear masks socially distance. Flu shots probably great example they're around 50% effective around 50% people get it. flu still quite prevalent. There's plenty diseases eradicated near-eradicated due vaccines highly effective high uptake though, hopefully happens COVID too... Daring say heresy Reddit definitely get banned, Reddit real world stand brother. know plenty people COVID, ones died 70s multiple chronic illnesses nursing homes one foot grave COVID, ones younger 60 several chronic illnesses mild cold flu like symptoms, symptoms all. ever get vaccine I'll wait 5 10 years see long term effects first. Suppose let diseased masses point considering virus bad south border. Never change, Ohio. states won’t even lockdown, martial law would happen Covid mutated deadly something. Funny vaccination timeline may line people Easter gatherings. Maybe broken clock right whole year later... business affects health wellbeing. Period. already costs $100 test WHAT? stay home never meet someone without wearing mask distancing even pandemic? think will, weirdo. nobody will. talking point warmongers last 20 years?

""If bowl full M&amp;Ms someone said 1 200 kill eat them?"" local source, WTOL, beautiful video it. One lady interviewed literally said ""that's kind crime there..."" referring shooting someone. look mobility data, see couple dips periodically Spring, nothing resembles Summer holiday. spend $600 month food? think they're ordering refrigerator trucks house bodies lot states right now...so may right that's happen.
I'm sorry family members. remember Katrina...it traumatized even watching TV. believe happening America. China running blacklist system block polluted food since frozen shrimp Ecuador tested positive even passive method oppposed exporters lot people want block imports kind unrealistic massive ban would make impact recovering domestic consumption. government knows dangerous idea ideally. 


However huge amount people break lockdown rules regardless celebrate Xmas, forced outline controlled manner households mix Christmas. pals said would seeing parents regardless lockdown.


Let's hope current lockdown, school holidays Jan lockdown keeps NHS alive! people share news countries US live pursuing elimination strategy. reached zero cases repealed mask mandates outdoors only, indoors. fuckin am. family is. friends are. co-workers? Neighbors? Apparently not. 4:1 ratio women men. It’s auto-immune reaction. Similar ratio existing POTS community autoimmune diseases general. 

Most people won’t recover. cure attempting (usually poorly) treating symptoms. violently American thing I've read days. someone Thanksgiving table COVID-19, I'm fucked regardless. live parents canceled Thanksgiving Christmas plans, one us three would bring house. think that's fucking joke. fucking. Singapore, costs US$150. Unsubsidised, is. Tests Public Health Preparedness Clinics free within 48 hours consultation, cost $10 afterwards. Could stop nonsense? Mortality lagging behind, takes time people actually die also one two weeks actually reported. Also, keep mind Sweden reports deaths death date rather report date, always look like deaths declining looking graphs.

When looking either cases, hospitalization ICU, clear situation serious right now. Haha let's make fun person either shy anxiety. /s one it? article behind paywall. Dumbasses “muh first amendment rights” seem forget they’re trying enter *private property*. Yes, anticipated lag, spikes assume skyrocket catch-up period. expect accurate numbers while... lack funding, chaos D.C., changing president, filling hospitals, loss essential workers, deaths home, still bodies moved surreptitiously... Dark Winter, may come call it. Kelowna RCMP note businesses responsibility due recent public health order ask patrons wear face coverings non-medical masks premises refuse service non-compliance.

Fuck that. run business 11 female staff. specifically instructed try enforce mask rules safe so. Fuck RCMP, Dr. Henry, Worksafe problem non-enforcement policy.

My staff trained law enforcement. Store &amp; Celebrate. went funeral family members died Katrina. Three months later. stored kept funeral. could 

?! us do, especially resident physicians easily putting 13+ hours day 6 days week. realize comment made sort seriousness, right? kind posts make thankful live Australia solid point. First make sure everyone, regardless income status, opportunity vaccinate. kind foundational part nation.

We started rebellion ancestors perceived overreach excessive control exploitation authoritative government.

So rebelled set rules essentially ensured continuing rebellion. pretty strict recommendations requirements work home, avoid unnecessary travel, avoid risks infected etc. place throughout mid-march onwards definitely impact hospitalization rates. IDK would want disregard saying ""The thing ... Summer holiday"". 

 
Misinformation least. believe it, I'm LA County lmao. No. still need lot every month rent etc. It’s immoral I’m like begging quarantined.. Fully paid day off! Besides email head epidemiologist said they're going choose strategy leads herd immunity EU calculates two countries EU better Sweden 2020. Ireland Litauen. I'm sensing pattern here. that’s allowed, force people wear places actually little. Like walking dog? It’s give outward appearance government stuff. Lol well we'll see I'm sure safer. Politics piss  Medical staffs quit let people fend idea I’m downvoted

People sub like someone fact checks bleak predictions. That’s saying!!!! DON’T herd immunity! trying agree you! must worded wrong lmao don’t hate me. You...you look past money? Even now?! cognitive decline/ brain fog severe week 2-6 could explain dementia. couldn’t find words. People would talk knew wasn’t going remember said two minutes. constantly lost train thought trying communicate. horrendous. slapping face here. editor? Read headline. Assuming English first language (correct wrong ) interpretation. leave ambiguity sloppy reads yours. better headline ""No signs attempts herd immunity slowing coronavirus Sweden"". Again. Read headline. Sweden herd immunity. Herd immunity subject sentence. Slowing verb. Herd immunity slowing. 

Other examples. ""The musicians stop playing nine"". Implications musicians band playing. 

What exactly getting misleading use language is????? people shop lift, call cops deal shoplifter. expect staff muscle, unless hired security purpose. also decide allow shoplifting danger staff. establish prevention measures business risk. Difference LIVES risk. Yours, staffs, people come contact -be family, friends, customers, strangers. Establish system, call cops people comply. every responsible business doing. entitled dumbie Alright, come let’s push this. Please let Corona hell end. Portugal report third covid deaths. already passed Sweden long time Darn always countries besides US I’m reading lately? Well, I’ll go back school don’t need masks. I’ll probably billionaire har-de-har-har think overconfident become new normal. yes # patient

Kinda wanted grandparents get first whatever. lot studies.

That's point. said “there signs showing herd immunity” that’s meant herd immunity there. explain point article explaining mean? interested. falling headlines click-bait trap.

[Death count case reporting correlate 22 day hey man ever think major nations destroyed it'll tribes jungles rise survive. jungle warfare going rule world? nurse know gotten covid twice now. first time quarantine two weeks home. second time didn’t get quarantine since symptoms weren’t bad hospital extremely short staffed overrun, kept covid ward. topic still remember opening act vs Iraq US declare war simply start firing cruise missiles... seems kinda cowardly too. OC said thing two comment. Yeah tested positive. [22 days reporting results death fits almost Especially Sweden never really good argument claims

* Sweden enact restrictions recommendations spring brought spread down, never let run wild
* Seasonality helped keep summer, second wave fall always expected (although serious second wave)
* Swedish strategy relies lot social security net: Paid sick leave, unemployment benefits, paid stay home sick kids, strong unions labor laws protecting people arbitrarily fired etc. state basically pays people stay home.
* optimal strategy probably differs lot different places. example, New Zealand awesome job, strategy probably work anywhere Europe America. People Sweden Nordics generally trust government lot, making voluntary measures effective here. read article, healthcare workers people nursing homes would still get first. I'm liberal You’re right, stay away might risk, science would tell I. Science would also suggest cars dangerous, 1.35 million die around world every year. one seems care car crashes don’t get retweets. mask wearing. Im Spanish.  Error 404 Yeah. Masks fine job limited exposure like grocery store station, well situations sick person shares room extended time. takes one person catch school, work, social gathering bring home get whole family sick. Well, I’m sure make sure tested recently getting it. I’m expert course, ways testing quickly. sky really falling? Uh....there cop entrance Albertsons yesterday actually. Tripout. Masks never meant measure supposed take. Everything staying least six feet apart washing hands touching faces sharing food/drinks supposed work unison people got extremely stuck masks cure-all. Even places high mask compliance bet people distance often should. universe living people actually receive information use accordingly? **Oleander fun-facts**:

They popular pot-flowers pretty indestructible. Survive - 10°C freezing outside.

Wouldn't eat though. family called Hundsgiftgewächse German. Dog-poison-plant. Tell people empty seats next year’s Thanksgiving due taking pandemic seriously. happen every family, no. Guarantee families.

Bottom line worth it. Could realistic. Even vaccines available, need lot people get vaccinated work. would require lot people get page always going people immune systems behave way they're supposed to. much done this.

Right now, existing strains vulnerable vaccines. probably continue case. friendly reminder science religion, cannot accept deny it. bunch methods. Hence article makes sense. Demon semen Fauci even went far say (and vaccine studies) live theater, without restriction, would likely reality end next year assuming vaccine effective 90-95% level we’ve seen. Great news anyone employed live/performing arts industries. feel like 95% science bullshit traced back mathematician, scientist doctor convinced *definitely* qualified defining authority specialty theirs. hope wake-up call deindustrializing economy focusing almost exclusively primary resource extraction big mistake.  know kept reporting misleading information whenever showed YouTube Feed........Mission Accomplished? mean ...

Unfortunately seems entirely possible. 

The really nerve-wracking part first ever mRNA vaccine don’t know don’t know. side effects show longer time frame there’s way know yet. 

What tough thing whole humanity. could looking huge numbers people long term illness virus vaccine both. 

To clear pro science. We’ll take vaccine. may choice. I’m probably way list people get since work home 60.

Because impossibly unlikely Pfizer Moderna cooked books round, knew FDA going spend 3 weeks scouring test results.

So everyone confidently say today start rolling vaccines within 17 days. 

But take 17 days now, 3 years, 15 years, pandemic dire, pharmaceutical companies data says we're 99% sure, cut corner one test, FDA check 2020, now, roll health care workers validate later.

**It's hard detect COVID-19 children**

Infections SARS-CoV-2, virus causes COVID-19, children generally [much adults easy overlook. study South Korea found majority children symptoms mild enough go unrecognized, [only 9% diagnosed time symptom used antibody test (which detect person virus previously recovered) screen representative sample nearly 12,000 children general population Germany. found [majority cases children itself, that's surprising, many cases adults missed, too.

But made study important, showed young older children similarly likely infected.

Official testing Germany suggested young children much less likely infected teenagers, true. Younger children infections getting tested. study also found nearly half infected children asymptomatic. [twice what's typically seen case IQ, comment likely referring to, mean, median, mode (100). normal distribution reset always case. average IQ increases younger generations (the Flynn effect) average always 100. Ford multiple shifts, people go vacation. Plus want family suppliers vaccinated. Can't make cars can't get alternators, turn can't build alternators can't get wire, turn... Ford probably working long game get lots non Ford people vaccinated fast. it’s thing every channel- streaming services watch hide it.

There hiding 9/11- short turning TV radio. Yes meant. understand natural work, proven efficient case COVID. Australia boss. Even pandemic boss. country culture boss. Australia = Boss. Look positive side: bash catholics, safe sure head chopped like another religion.

Study link:  get suck getting vaccine, I'm saying new concept. I've heard herd immunity reason increase amount people getting flu shots years. people got it, would better vaccine herd influenza vaccination coverage must increased United States Europe order establish herd immunity. necessary develop new influenza prevention messages based herd immunity.

I feel like world finally waking realizing, _it's you_ long overdue. point lockdowns stay home orders don’t work (and others seems) easily disproven that. keep putting blame government don’t get upset life isn’t back normal. rarely go anywhere anyway. got mild case, that's perfectly normal. ain't Swedish tho could forget! Thank you. I’ll add list update sources etc. rural areas already lots liquid nitrogen infrastructure, farmers using personally artificial insemination. might run problem cold... Wait, agree Swedes country later date Denmark? Yup same. situation improved covid late February. April-June recall words brain fog. Even simple maths eluded me. get better, relapses weeks later. Covids mad. “Only come back opinion pieces”

Since Swedish following debate closely, remark must actual conscious lie. 

You cannot missed emails fx. fact well known. thus, protestant religion born. Calabria could called ""third world country"", would wrong anyway Sigh.. said. discussion epidemiologist Finland. allowing schools open would quicken spread reach heard immunity among young population. discussion ended good idea.. like heavy rain, taking rain coat 5 minutes. also sort makes redundant. Good, best guy idiot. Good. agree, hospitals piling covid deniers anti-maskers need turned away. made play. fair everyone else needs treatment (not covid) get sub-standard care **I know** need tighten restrictions even get numbers fetched numbers made spreadsheet. expected R drop April/May values half much.

We're R == 1, means amount infections change. deaths little behind, rate soon steady, too. purpose deaths show lockdown really necessary.

2850 people died react September, Christmas ruined maybe skeptics might right let's try (they weren't). find bizarre movie ""Contagion"" quack promotes flower-named elixir ""Forsythia"" infection. Pillow guy others promoting extracts toxic shrub known pretty flowers. bit much life imitating art.

Yes.

I even wondering Pillow Guy got idea movie. guess missed ""trial run"" articles. 

They trial runs Texas two states. Basically room error Pfizer vaccine. boxes opened twice day minute. 

This good thing. shows want waste vaccine. Yeah, reason Parler exists Might complicated understand. Maybe straightforward message helps ""Thanksgiving good last one loved ones.' 2021: anti vaxxers grounded source also state trying decrease infection low possible, sound like herd immunity strategy you? able stick truth. guys?!? 


Dates Swedish “sport holiday” varies across country. Either week 7, 8, 9 10. 

In Denmark holiday also varies across country. It’s either week 7 8.

Exactly week claim “the virus came Europe” “Sweden 10% population outside Sweden”? anything back two claims?

I know Sweden like tell Stockholm hit hard COVID, holiday week 9. evidence ever supplied anybody. Unfortunately Walmart shop reduced hours. go 7 earliest still many people liking. tired watching vote people care die. Ah okay, guess guy deciding strategy then? Everytime ask source everyone posts single slide small community north bit nothing else, guess guy decided whole strategy makes sense. want persecuted reinforces assertion companies like Google corrupt. fans need migrate platform make way money of. There's stopping this, they've already won. According little search, Denmark 23st Feb Stockholm 1st march. Unless provide source. mask seals beard beard becomes mask. Guys aunt grandma russia got sick covid 83 year old grandma mild case, low grade fever week, possible? got tested antibodies recommended isolation period 10 days symptom onset. recommended quarantine period exposure 14 days. Yes. right. worst best possible either prediction vaccines widely available US, mask wearing stop, least outdoors. Indoors might take months solid evidence cases decreasing.  ""First, Thanksgiving Day perhaps early Wednesday, three metrics flatten drop, probably several days. decrease make look like things getting better national level. Then, week following holiday, test, case, death numbers spike, look like confirmation Thanksgiving causing outbreaks worsen. neither expected movements data necessarily mean anything state pandemic itself."" Yellow fever common requirement.

Those diseases much worse covid though spreading that's happening increase deaths time Christmas. sad time many families. Stockholm's sport week weeks later Norway's? That’s reasonable, thanks reply! Whatever title paid makes difference.

The important thing former state epidemiologist: spout gut feelings media would listen him. Viewing foolhardy (relatively small) Sturgis rally spreader model, potential consequences nationwide Thanksgiving travel/gatherings almost much imagine. I-O! OH? did, looks like Sweden one absolutely hardest hit countries Europe (and world)

Compared Sweden's neighboring countries, number deaths catastrophically high. Yup.

Or don’t visit. 

Stay hillbilly land. see appeal people small kids, exact opposite I'm looking vacation. also completely incompatible climate science desire authentic experiences. hell telling people safe go back work without precautions?? exactly CDC, Public Health agency responsible public health. helps explain didnt take thougher approach. idea might cause suffering long run. 
reson Fox news liberal used together seems wrong. freedoms!!!! How's different norway? Also we're well second wave now.

And austria example millions foreign tourists country winter season 2020, brought corona them.

In addition, i'm even seeing sweden much better austria switzerland, fact countries fewer deaths.

It true situation sweden escalate complete disaster, people predicted, kind smug pride Swedes taking country's handling crises think unwarranted numbers, especially compared neighbours.
But sure, compare country spain feel superior makes happy. understand people can't see person. didn’t say should, said medical people taking vaccine doesn;t mean immune need immunity test results well work large scale Based experience overwhelmed areas far, lot harder track deaths start happening home well. people touch hot stove get burned learn fire hot tragic especially someone like opens shares wisdom experience.  Thank sharing story unfortunately everyone listen us helped us stay much safer much careful. like that, happy suggest mandatory take one brand new vaccines? Hows Nana? Geez... mean honest everybody travels Thanksgiving going get covid. Okay, pretend you, science, predict future. mean time, I've great, I'll keep that. Al Qaeda repeatedly said war US. remember 98 embassy bombing? act war? Actually working expected, even slightly better. Schools ages open 100%, workplaces open full-time. Also, people bothered Corona.

They convening today, additional measures. likely pass hard enforce contact-limiting measure R going continue stay around 1. interesting see happens around Christmas. 18 million health care workers US. could mean almost 20% health care workers could immune month two. record people hospital record people COVID hospital? brother air force quarantine 4 days gets stationed at. went boot camp full 14 day quarantine.  yes please give addiction purpose Yawn.

Like know anything science...... course masks necessary useful enough contain spread. Social distancing is. family friends meeting home anyewehe without masks. even masks long time enclosed space. Without this, masks slow bit. Good enough. Agree, grandfather (mid 80s) contracted virus (years ago, COVID) gave acute onset dementia. sucks healthy young person gets vaccine last group. Old people, people risk groups etc could go holiday still Allowed anything, get vaccine last. sucks major ass... Ouch... Likely employer badge, letter employer, cases may vaccinate place employment (food processing plant example. doubt make strict (yes may assholes try cut line making people want vaccinated jump hoops may reduce amount get vaccinated). 

Your state release detailed information shortly CDC makes recommendation prioritization. Trump Alberta. Yeah, gonna minimum hope best. Health advisors, needs them. 

Note, go politician experiencing heart attack. Things always looking bad America. masks busy transit venues like airports train stations bad. that. forced course. Excellent! Oh again, interested buddy. zoom meeting get together. 1. deadly virus? arbitrary, classify deadly? me, virus survival rate 90% highest risk group(over 99.97% me) deadly. maybe is. said arbitrary. yes maybe dangerous some, need precautions NOW. now.

2. meant pandemic. course need measures pandemic end sometime (sometime soon hope). then, 99% us measures back normal life.

3. scenario pandemic never ending, while, yes i'd probably start give instincts live life like did. feel like getting paradox point ask ourselves: ""a ship harbor safe, ships made for?"" netherlands brought infections hospital numbers almost 0 first wave without wearing masks. isolation, washing hands, keep social circle small. Well, they're special outlier time unfortunately. Rest Europe US pretty bad along Italy time. feel sorry experiencing... That's horrible comparison, 7/4 = 57% prediction, 90,000/6,000 = 6% prediction. Would better say instead losing 30-1 lost 2-1. joke, Pfizer announcing efficacy led masterpiece

And one Moderna vaccine (Pfizer post taken Twitter account) Hey Stone Mountain! Piedmont Park says good morning. 

Me wife tested positive early October little-to-no symptoms. Kinda waiting long-term shoe fall. Horrible virus hope everyone canceling large Thanksgiving year. live Sydney.

So proud happy luck.

S9 sorrowful happening man places, tho funny part news: ""pig head"" also slang ""dumbass"" Chinese. *Goal Herd hear that. Surprising suggestion someone sick ICU virus. Even best medical care. Joe Six Pack probably would gone hospital got sick, may died virus. Fuck Donald Trump politicizing virus. 

I swear, come &amp; said ""wear mask"" we'd seen less deaths.

Instead, give half assed twitter post &amp; proceeded mock people wore masks. add insult injury, held many rallies ended infecting (and killing) tons people.

If real leadership start, happened. Instead, narcissist proud admit wrong covid. ego, desire always appear right everything, led disaster. Real leaders admit wrong &amp; fix things. Trump made stupid statements &amp; STILL acknowledged rising cases/deaths. 

It help delayed stimulus aid forcing senate focus nominating Amy Coathanger Barrett. Oh go crawl back rock. Potentially Oxford one need deep freeze transport much accessible kind work. science says ""Yup"" ... yet need wear mask get vaccinated? Everyone complains ""Commiefornia"" Florida literally needs chiseled set adrift. incredible cesspool anti-thought inbreds. Really? deadly cancer?? Since when? That's nice you. like see giving around holidays. December: ""Hold beer."" covid normal live.

No reported cases 25 days. Daily tests around 10 k pop 5 million.

Masks mandatory indoors.

Max 15 people homes.

Churches 20 people indoors. Don’t worry American conservatives lack empathy call welfare kings/queens Oh yeah, clever me. totally pick condescending tone comment reference (checks notes) empathy. /s guess matter, since Sweden almost 10% population outside Sweden, mostly Alps Italy, Switzerland Austria, virus first started hitting Europe. opinion would unfair compare Sweden countries less hard hit ln beginning. I've found enjoy wearing lot colder weather. like people less likely bother about. people top

Source? disagree that. need stop virus costs. believe mandate vaccine. Swedes saying since spring can't measures neighbours laws. starting those, guess could those.  I’ll get want get it, fucking corpo tells to. get saying, pretty tone deaf given article replying to. work healthcare seeing COVID screenings daily working time. pay enough money ICU nurse right now. Whew. Thank goodness. Enjoy Thanksgiving huge family get together! @ny busy nightclub USA super spreader right now. Glad see vaccines coming out. It’ll help consumer Australia political leaders urge healthcare workers first line defence - considered **last** line defence. I'd imagine developed countries donate vacines need 

But ordered Break... actually look virus first came countries different guess want research comparing numbers alot nuance it. says Goal Herd immunity. never talked vaccines then. Check post history, Mariah’s anti-mask, anti-lockdown, anti-pope nutbag who’s believing grocery store workers front line workers need vaccine Mariah holiday travel plans because, quote, “it’s holidays, deal it. Either she’s nuts negative karma farmer really leaning in. People travelling gathering Thanksgiving celebration.

And everyone rushing crowdy stores Black Friday.

What could possibly go wrong?  people dying today infected three weeks ago. Three weeks ago cases like 85-95k/day. We've doubled cases since then, expect daily deaths double next three weeks - without even taking Thanksgiving spread account. Also thought. Throwing around big 'US equivalent' numbers makes appear, layman, US actually well comparison. Also, notice listed 'US equivalent' numbers decreasing order, biggest numbers appear first? LMAO Sweden 10% population outside Sweden virus came Europe, really think realistic goal eliminate virus? Bet asked sources behind claims come back opinion pieces. think need tighten restrictions even get numbers down. They’ve sat level 4 weeks already it’s working enough. Whoa... brutal, gonna lie. Good want wait science repurcussions, any, be. yellow fever. think it’s still enforced countries. you’re right, airlines. like make much YouTube shame struggling much now. really one best performers Europe. Sadly, lockdown isn’t strict enough tighten close non essential shops schools figures keep rising. much d3nial happening,

Good things happening much slower many people’s expectations... Selfish altruism work. noticed parallels covid climate change. It’s exact portion population denies it’s economically convient accept truth. Boris Johnson’s “5 days Christmas everything fine take break COVID “ dangerous seems people get symptoms faster two full weeks. said, seems silly change things bad. Ok editing dangerous/illegal content different editing typical content. don’t know legal liability, acting moderator, editor. put child lock OANN parents house dad became brainwashed American Canada like Canada, say “Americans First” vaccine distribution. simply can’t watch fellow countrymen passing away like this. 

Biden needs distribute vaccines American people first ultimate responsibility make country great again.

Of course, condition able take care ourselves, absolutely hope help Canadians necessary. fear violence good thing. override it. Let protect you. utterly despise anti-maskers, they're 'anti-mask' first place shows they're rational. America morally bankrupt. Like honestly. exist country self-absorbed, greedy, selfish, arrogant, entitled whiny violent babies US.

People suck everywhere. holy hell, Americans take next level asshole. Fuck noise. We're losing rights people ignorant selfish wear masks. literally point healthcare system starting collapse. 

Do want home, public rest us suffer bad decisions. live rural Kentucky. County Attorney's office told one chin-diapered staff could take mask off. Ten family members 8th grade teacher Covid. Half rural fire department serves part county it. Really hope exhaust fan isn’t shared neighboring unit... true CDC said ""limit alcohol, loud noises, singing""? Like politicans making sure people like asshole access weapons. 8 Wednesday prime time. Except USA one yhe nations holds citizens livin foreign countries liable income tax.  I'm saying. keep trying carve ""sides"", like there's hive-mind controlling people. isn't. sides issue, individual people making individual choice wear masks quarantine, to. 

Their thought process simple - basic cost/benefit analysis. find that, individually, mask benefits irritates, put on. not, don't. many, fact mask offers small amount protection contributes decision huge protection offers others. many others, protection mask offers others relevance decision. New homes affordable anymore. get respect browns fan living cleveland, say games fire anyone else loses credibility

unless course enjoy seeing hilarious dumpster fires authoritarianism leading front. 
From lockdown measures would ignored countries, direst straights. examples welding people inside buildings mandatory locater programs people's smartphones.

Smartphone programs help warn people near someone tested positive science. 

Saying phone active else Authoritarianism. CCP led authoritarianism beginning Covid. Yall gon stick doctored shit normally takes years develop? yo rabid ass mind. dint know one person willing Guinea pig fir Corona vaccine trials. Cause that's take it. Fuck shit That's it! appreciate needing wear makeup portion face, really really enjoy getting infected *normal* pathogens floating around. sick since last December, used catch cold every 2 months! Love fact someone points immediately gets downvoted. Fauci wishy washy liberal mouthpiece I've ever met Every comment read makes lose IQ points Hold now.

Racism xenophobia anyone looks vaguely Asian justified COVID. Wearing mask, however, not. Yes do. Thank you. Lmfao what....? Everyone know covid mild symptoms. vaccine sounds much worse. 100% this. clarify - I'm encouraging taking masks/not distancing really situation. Ideally everyone would keep households would wear masks + distance time, ""pod"" not. saying careful public better all. \*cries American\* Yeah, that's frustrating get excitement around vaccine suddenly we're getting articles still wear masks getting vaccine.

I've safe pandemic continue wearing masks social distancing, taking vaccine 95% efficacy, intend constantly wear masks. Singapore government requires masks public? so, authorities detain, arrest, jail, fine offenders wear mask public?  Missing point completely. testing key lesson whole mess hope UK &amp; NI. Increased capacity hospitals building NHS priority instead paying private entities provide tests testing facilities. all, NHS constant state collapse caused lockdowns. September 2019. tell this. I’ve heard similar things it’s concerning. Thanks. point, seems sweden's ego stopping taking U turn.. think could bit benevolent sexism combined seems like logical excuse get violent. want to/desire chance get violent. Wait what's death cult? don’t wear mask save children covid-19. You’re right, risk covid-19 children actually lower seasonal flu. risk covid equivalent seasonal flu across age bands wouldn’t wear mask, wouldn’t mess right now. 

I wear mask protect elderly vulnerable populations, unlike children, risk much much greater seasonal flu. 

I’m glad find wearing mask equivalent putting pants morning. don’t. find uncomfortable depressing, due suppression human communication comes along wearing them. Humans socialize communicate voice, body language facial expressions. rather depressing large aspect communication absent society. 

Masks suck. **But necessary evil right now**. risk seasonal flu risk tolerate, unless you’re Howie Mandel course. Besides, whole point never eliminating viral death society. making sure hospitals operate normal capacity without overrun. current flu risk level, get covid -19 similar risk level end preventative measures currently taking. It’s information doesn’t change risk assessment. Good description. true hallmarks prototypical ""self-righteous douche bag"". Great, everything go super smooth then. can't wait I'll sleep well tonight. Climate change ongoing existential crisis right pretty daft whole. idea OP bio background one building degree research dozens of-80 C freezers. biotech, biology research, perhaps applied hard sciences. makes wonder even smaller college campuses could distribution hubs. Same, totally confused, hospitals pretty full collapse..In face temporary hospitals didnt even used. No. opposite: Technocracy called authoritarianism people. could save 15% Geico... think regardless position pandemic public health measures messages last 8 months extremely poor opaque. 

I would also argue lot people(and governments/the media) last 8 months lot skewing themselves. Come approach cherry pick data support it, find worse parameters broadcast public. death rate goes down(it has) focus cases. focus countries worst. 

So yeah think skewing. 😂 post link it. even plausible troll. And, fact child rape first thing popped head someone pointed wrong seriously gross. Seek help. Selfish assholes quickly pushing country edge we're going start standing what's right, even costs us something really want give. really think ancestors played safe time, think maybe stood right? We've living rent-free sacrifices that's unfortunately probably coming end sooner anyone would expected wanted. ""He give us lot money"" - Republicans. agree sentiment message, sad fact is, late. appreciate concern, mean sincerely. one also walking away asshole bad scene hope never repeats. I've lost fear violence mean *want* it!

I feel strongly this. mom 86 COPD I've seen twice, distance, since March, 19 year old niece lives immunosuppressed organ transplants, 18 year old daughter's life hold stir-crazy, we've isolating since end February *frustrating* see, this, anti-maskers continuing help make things worse. 😭 Trump basically staked entire reputation vaccines. I'm worried Rural Americans getting vaccinated it. am, however, worried far large contingent pseudo-intellectuals left expressing ton reservations getting vaccinated. I'm big doomsdayer anyone, that's true. masking distancing public, someone pod gets it, it'll spread around pod stop spread pods. way better situation everybody wreckless public. greatest generation. 

Haven't heard? They're longer charge. Make America Great Generation is. freedom important!! (sarcastic) Ya give enough fucks comment :,) niece nurse New Jersey facility tells similar story you. hellholes. wife nurse plenty coworkers anti-mask plandemic types. really fucking bizarre me. don’t know vaccine make us immune. we’re going try. Deaths 10 times higher Nordic neighbours, actually economy also slightly worse Nordic neighbours, otherwise average EU. also hear stories people swim suddenly drown die. It’s extremely rare. dozen kids underlying conditions die covid doubt tragedy, compare number covid deaths 65, number kids statistically negligible. wish people understood sizes numbers compare more. Hahahah Right, mean, coolers way down, freezer hold -60 likely better insulated (and actively cools -60) reasonable cooler.

With large budget, could put -60 freezer walkin freezer, another peltier powered freezer inside get additional temperature differential -60. (With understanding efficiency goes shit, going need roughly order magnitude cooling power stage cascade) Exactly need mandates, travel bans, etc. Guess fucked can't vaccines health reasons. always way?  noticed bad before.

Been way while. pandemic plus current political discourse made obvious. Lol thats going happen. taken like 9 months kill what, 250k? vaccines coming soon. Even vaccinating oldest 10% country would probably cut number people dying least 50% bare min.

My guess covid killed around 325k Americans time over. Thanks! think also excellent organism and/or Reddit entity ""Trumps America"" can’t believe people believe “cures” Nope, yet. Soon I'll go 2-month check-in, point I'll ask suppose. Even 100 million doses across vaccine candidates produced far. good news much infrastructure rapidly scale production happened pace vaccine development greatly increase going early next year. hard find. Also, let’s clear Covid spreads. It’s always go act irresponsibly get sick. It’s often loved ones family members. Also, people ending ICU’s aren’t ones spreading around over, they’re exactly getting about. asymptomatic carries worrisome. one showing without context? early spring cases done nothing go up, others? even know that's real? even actually know mass graves unclaimed bodies unusual anyway. two thumbs sold stocks moderna December? guy there's kind special air purifier dental offices use. Hey! Hey! - *PILLOW SALESMAN* *loves GEEZUS*! *MUST* know he's talking about! indeed, china though? This. longer protected content posted site assume responsibility content sites. bad late dude It’s dumb worry that. Flu shot options depend live. states, lot pharmacies people fill paperwork ahead time, online. know CVS fill paperwork online book appointment. heard places even offer drive-up flu clinics flu shots via service window. Flu shots also available doctors offices medical clinics, states insurance. lot providers trying mitigate exposure risk patients vaccine administrators, may less public exposure time year covid precautions put place. It’s always good idea call around ask procedure year see fits comfort level. real. video calling tech one, maybe two years. Like half country falls vulnerable categories age and/or co-morbidities preexisting conditions get downvoted would mind business. ya hour driver's blood cold, nearly cold enough store vaccine anything us. 0.3% low income countries already lower age death. high income countries ~1% horribly high. resources stretched limit

Collapse. Collapse word looking for. I'm tired euphemisms. WI MN sugarcoat things, even they're evil topics. Science works. It’s demonstrably true. Anyone else feel like goal posts going keep moving? see stuff like: ""the vaccine wont silver bullet"" experts saying ""returning sense normalcy \_\_\_"" hard feel like gas lighted.

Whilst know day vaccine comes out, end like various reasons, certainly understand people giving holidays. Actions consequences. think fake reports even saying dying patients don’t believe it’s Covid. Sounds dreadfully familiar. got screamed cussed simply motioning women pulled mask up. mouth could walk around store talk phone. lost it. People insanely triggered reason all. Grandma south Depends source. found one put 23rd. think Statistica 21st.

Point they've dropped even though they've implemented far fewer restrictions locales rise. know several barely felt anything all. aware Mongolia different country China? getting exhausting. Seriously, missing point. 

Yes. push mitigation good faith onto people, you’re going win. America least. want personal freedom. told “only leave house necessary ” absolutely tread personal freedom. It’s argument, it’s fact. ~surprise~ people don’t want isolated. there’s nothing, legally, that.

So what?

And add: stay home. You’re entitled stay home. You’re entitled leave home well. Collapse word looking for. Yea old company would pay nurse come office give us free (company paid for) flu vaccines every year. worse side effects flu vaccination? years it’s perfectly fine, years get shot experience lot side effects listed. used think strange seeing Asian citizens wearing masks sick pre COVID. understand selfish western dicks wearing them.  🙃 think wise man would wait bit see goes first batch vaccinated people can’t realistically advise people this. I’m hurry. available Europe. Anywhere else? Unfortunately vast majority privately held companies. Good Choice. I’ve wearing P100 always leaving house since February don’t regret it. think misunderstood initial comment. I'm saying they've woefully underreported cases deaths ability collect data limited. healthcare bad for-profit private hospitals, experience public hospitals. know lowest number ICU beds per capita country world, iself lead increased CFR. 

I find plausible, however, immune systems seen something similar enough SARS-COV-2 past mount moderately effective immune response country mostly hot humid. Cool, dry air facilitates spread virus. 

I also suspect pressure Modi government keep numbers low. would imagine LOT ways could fudge numbers. instance, someone can't prove born, really die? huge number births country record of. know I'm pretty damn sure Lyme disease almost 20 years ago now. unquestionably tick bite disease, Dr. finally went see thought might die (I'm usually go see Dr. type person) said could send blood sample analyzed it'd cost bunch he'd writing prescription medication regardless got scrip got well days.

Please persevere, need someone vent simply chat send message. need 10,000 freezers last line said lol lets real ass curious political prisoner camps there, ask Uyghurs Ugh, feel this. mom 5 weeks fall sick. She’s 88. exhausting (she several accidents bed), got well enough constantly bored. husband fought first two weeks nothing. She’s back apartment now. care workers checking 3 times day. bad arthritis osteoporosis medical problems.  China test positive go quarantine hotel shoot you. Early pandemic, welding people inside apartments screened Fever.

The covid cases country country voting this, karma dumb fuck comments like this. Well deserved karma.  Yeah surprisingly good. Sounds gross first I'm surprised caught over. Individual Americans care. America political entity not. HK give Beijing call another mass test, that's freedom never enjoy elsewhere.

Also, they'll soon finally free colonialism: British judges evicted transported? special reefer trailers something? !remindme 5 months mean they’re dumb enough wedding big indoors pandemic, wouldn’t worry much spreading it. knew risks. premed student lecturing us lmao. clue talking about. Nursing curriculum *is* standardized. specific requirements classes Accredited Nursing school offer. Moreover NCLEX covers lot material specifically designed present questions related material finds test taker weak on. test taker weak Pediatrics test literally offer Peds questions again.

Moreover, NCLEX continually adjusts present harder harder questions test taker, giving question difficulty score. inevitably test taker reach point test start getting questions wrong. whether questions got wrong strong enough pass threshold passing not. Good hear. concerned fellow shoppers unsafe, hand basket perishables employee, give short explanation leave. company's business handle COVID business want business. said Mexico major US city. Democracies varies place place people people, like things world. Democracy 100 1000 variations, make political models completely useless. bad behaviors CCP international level, blaming every bad things results ""not democracy"" simple minded. Right Revolutionary War. weird Brits Spoken like true conservative, sounds disgusting. read like 8 times, THINK saying “all people work corporations essential people work government capacity leeches deserve die obviously vote different way me.” 

Just average conservative hot nonsense. horrible opinion honestly. stand up. happen right. get shot. guy wrong. goes jail long time. dead. kids missing parent spouse widow(er). world better place exactly? fact right get you? dead wrong. stupid. ancestors survived precisely played safe time. Better run hear bushes rustle. Sure probably wind one time lion, fucked. southern part Italy pretty much 3rd world country. Bergamo hit hard sure south cope. One know pandemic about, compare influenza. coming people. professionals pretty consistent shortcomings potential vaccine start. ""things go back normal soon"" people mostly random civilians trying optimistic. Republicans: ""Have tried looking?"" far coping mechanisms go, denial China's superior system par denying COVID exist intubation.

Science care want believe, loves punishing refuse acknowledge it.

Have great Thanksgiving. He’s athletic trainer it’s weird... surrounded kids day, actually job he’s gotta pretty close. doesn’t mess around though, order kid colleague mask properly working them. Sweden never herd immunity policy That's obnoxious. part CA? 

In part Bay Area, everyone's wearing since March. can't remember last time saw someone public without one. lmao this. work anti-mask nutjob, that's go-to position everything, including deodorant, washing hands shits, work he's getting paid for--can't tell do, etc etc. antisocial behavior, i'd say people like really belong woods somewhere, even varmints standards want insult them. pay benefits society participating it, want hold social contract fuck desert something. Wow, *sign form*! That’ll stop them. Nope, interested welding anyone anywhere. I’m saying people acting like personal liberties curtailed we’re trying keep new-to-humans virus ripping population dumb. 

You’re entitled life?? I’m entitled mine! wins? Also 1918 flu protests safety measures well. Freeduuuumb ! wasn’t lie. evidence masks effective. wasn’t like giant study peer reviewed replicated saying masks great, Fauci etc lied it. evidence (and mostly remains) circumstantial correlation/causation. thing changed public pressure appear something. deal stupid around you? keep head what? didn’t give fuck enough read past first sentence lmaoo fuck people come from? OANN super dangerous disinformation there’s quite suckers fall Idk here. cousin took flight Minnesota El Paso work told arrived one co-workers working tested positive. shortly arriving started feeling symptoms tested positive. exposed everyone airplane visiting parents exposing them. desision found astounding?  That's like him. disagree 90% Catholicism, did.

The pancake dinners nice 👌 think efficacy full shutdown far less people wearing masks. Another study today finding least 70% people wore masks consistently, virus would contained six weeks. I've seen study saying anything like full shutdowns.

I believe shutdowns clearly all. Nursing requires certain amount contact hours national exam. exam high fail rate, questions first second order questions. school go certain pass rate exam nursing program lose accreditation well. online programs nursing. online NP programs programs bridge Registered Nurses BSNs provided already associates passed NCLEX. NP programs still require certain amount clinical hours.

If want talk scope creep NPs PAs totally agreement. Speaking teacher got ass sat quarantine thanks positive student, teacher friend xx number kids ready bring covid life every day. one friend hang rarely outside distanced. works home, I'm risk giving unknowingly, hang inside close by. Would ideal, pick 1, would probably choose taxes. Malaria *IS* life threatening disease constitutes vaccination would necessary going place like Congo, Nigeria. 

I going apologize consider coronavirus something requires vaccination. made pretty clear people die (pre-existing conditions), also information provided mitigate effects happen catch it. 
In beginning, worried Coronavirus. supportive measures try eradicate virus, time progressed, quite apparent nobody knows fuck manage it. surprising say least look poorly run things planet. 
I stop looking data because, stated previously, things adding up.
Fill narrative want, continue shaming want. None new. I've repeatedly said COVID conspiracy theorists head hospital major city ask legitimacy COVID.

Not single one balls backup beliefs it.

When nurses doctors finally see end pandemic finally get free time, there's going HELL pay first person come across starts ranting fake. Yeah right.... What's next news Hongkong full democratic freedom? Sweden pursue herd immunity strategy? take account, reports strong correlation air quality India least four times amount deaths America least! that’s case. It’s got roughly half recorded deaths almost four times people, worse air quality, worse healthcare difference see India uses HCQ treatment.  He's partisan anti-Catholic pope we've ever ""big regret"" herd immunity never strategy? Yeah, understand position. pay staff, there, another kid be. accept new enrollment withdraw, they're going kick new kid months. 

Maybe things bad enough county shut preschools - hope exactly, would solve problem huge one others.

I hope able get virtual job. Stay safe. author even bother? 

It 8 month old meme authoritarianism blanket excuse used Americans unilaterally dismiss attempt even try learn anything China’s pandemic control measures. since clear Americans still won’t learn even COVID response measures given democratic sugarcoating countries successful responses. Azar may visited Taiwan allegedly “learn best pandemic control”, clearly interested sticking China diplomatic blown raspberry jack-squat virus.

What recourse people don’t even want try fix sorry state. really since normal gas use decreased drastically. would hard seperate variables. Maybe people smarter would able it.   Cheers. felt bit like jerk picking guy typo, image good pass up. Yep, state blessed propaganda let's say Qantas(without u) Kiwi now? seen giant f*ING Kangaroo logo? think Kangaroos New Zealand. maybe think New Zealand part Australia? Don’t put Trumpees box. limit three things don’t fit everyone. might voted Trump hated Hillary. could care less gun rights. minority. would like every anti-masker’s name recorded put last hospital triage get sick. anti-maskers illegible covid-related health insurance expenses. Jesus, what's big problem Americans mask. I've trying wrap head around it. move surprise all. KSA covid first hit. King proclaimed government would take care covid medical expenses everyone, including citizens noncitizens. took virus seriously. Public prayers cancelled, even cancelled Hajj. Curfews enforced. went several police checkpoints left -- movement restricted control virus. accounts working.

I returned US find absolute chaos plan whatsoever. I'm sure King sincere caring people PR. what's difference? always felt safe welcome Kingdom.

I'm sure usual brigade come shortly tell everything that's *eeeevil* Saudi Arabia. say you: go experience world. Everything simple. true. Tbh I’m Canada, dad uncle always things. Dad went 60km bike ride year got leukaemia. 83. took teaching classes 67. drove Florida every year. mom slowing she’s 88 lives own. attitude of, ""well 60s/70s/80s"" shocking. It’s partisan.

Exactly. Tax policy political disagreement. global pandemic not. Hey people kill lots reasons really sad know statistically face face transmissions across table Thanks Giving dinner..... could see breath killed someone care deeply. Really sad. add elaborate post? ""seeing community spread"", mean, cases see hospital? is, people end getting going hospital ones got work, trying best careful go work etc?  


Thank you. saying governors refrain due diligence, abundance caution, set secondary, independent review vaccine(s)? Mmm 12 isn’t lot fridges lol Huh? Tuesday’s one lowest death reporting days week? It’s literally highest reported death total day week substantial margin. 

You get point across without outright lying. Think hate breaking point today... tired hearing constant bad news, anxiety depression fucking roof they're not. live Georgia. know every family wants Christmas? funeral. 

That way get make Christmas miserable, get remember every year that. makes festivities extra jolly. go ahead post study general public non-medical mask effectiveness SARS1 think must surely studies. Duh! Public schools junk. people use private schools people can't afford it..... 

Including almost government employees....lol Fuck noise. They've worked entire pandemic grocery stores needed open. see country fine brainwashing. reason people *Pandemic* listened online blogger spends free time stalking University California San Francisco research scientist - they're scared nobody giving anybody straight answer interview 40 minutes long, replied 16. 

Again, havoc? News media US need show raw footage virus suffering death causes. don’t take seriously pretty much sheep like mentality. get better view this, could make bigger impact. remember Italy peak last spring, tons footage people gasping air, flipped stomachs. continue nurses cars crying heat “are almost capacity”. People still take social distancing, mask usage seriously. Hospital overload. Also hospital bad. Ah, every denier would actually read things instead using Sweden example handle pandemic states. Covid wiped whatever hope humanity, it’s sad feel way theirs? States room talk right now. Well people get vaccine spaces lines etc happen...why not? H1N1 shot came out...I drove 3 hours lined dark get it. sent various family members different sites wee hours morning get it. pregnant virus seemed hit pregnant women hard. essential workers vaccine..who cares people get long get want. better idea. I'll show country wiretaps citizens like country ever does. See also:
Schools need assume kids get spread COVID, operate safely ages

Amid COVID uncertainties, schools must aggressive universal masking, physical distancing, hygiene, ventilation, testing contact Q. intend target programming émigré communities country?

A. No. Existing law allow Agency create programs audiences United States, seek that. new law allow interested U.S. residents access USAGM content, upon request. Historically, organizations operating internationally representatives émigré communities – areas conflict — sought reliable news home countries native languages.

The modernization Smith-Mundt facilitate global connectivity audience engagement provide greater transparency publicly-funded honestly might get included healthcare workers. stunning point seems difference WWII rationing government enforced they're COVID measures.

I wonder COVID prevention measures gonna get treatment history books 50 years now. ""Everyone banded together stop spread!"" curious educators going high priority vaccination distribution. Start looking 8k week nursing jobs. Sorry loss. I'm camp too. friends pretty much got annoyed refusing attend birthday party. person organized pretty much stopped talking me. lot people around us infected minds serious all, that's viruses work. bigger things going world really care. sucks. made point watch March, HBO picked license.

It watch party actually everyone saying - “whose director, he’s accurate!” minutes later started nitpicking - “such wasn’t realistic . .”

That eight months ago everything else film since come pass. significant aspect failed predict presidential administration wasn’t even interested trying. can't act like publishers, they'd lose protection allows continue publishing, sorry, *disseminating* propaganda? Oh darn, shucks. 

What issue here. good anyone propagandists? give shit lose protection. goivernment pass stimulus people stay home get paid. required right mind. Definitely correct. Even war, America brought home thousands nazi scientists, especially work NASA. (Operation paper clip.) Madison Square Garden held nazi rallies. America entered war largely Pearl Harbor. retaliation, rather “coming together.” Even beating war, nazis never stopped marching here. also count deaths accurately. countries around world cannot say same. fix FDA, get judge vaccine based merits indicated data?  lost let's forget fat ass please Another thing people rarely mention effect masks depends many infected people around you. infected people, masks can't prevent infections.

It took us figure virus actually rampant lot communities, contagious people could idea infected. learned things really shifted calculus favor wearing masks everywhere know infected people everywhere. Yup. Also spike people looking get tested thinking test negative biggest, highest risk gathering possibly put together without worries.

Wait 2nd week December. Spoiler: gonna suck. people, man... give respect demand respect get offended get called bs. recent read number 60k, maybe 2 weeks ago? Exactly. make feel 22 years younger exactly 3:39 seconds. Oh, are. it’s going like 4 months vaccines going made available general public. going confuse people making think need get vaccine right away ones really need first health care workers.

If article published February 2021 would make little sense. suck.

I feel like I’m living crazy town see people talk sub local sub much enjoy wearing them.

Yeah, wear I’m supposed to, can’t fucking stand it. fog glasses generally uncomfortable. Don’t understand anyone could enjoy them. Thank you!! God f*cking damn way talks, seems think walk CVS month get shot. probably even expects praise admiration saying would let others get shot first. He's moron. people China. risk getting infected get relative infected. Plus, go night worrying robbed shot. Deal it. see saying. That's fair. Yikes america cousin picked son year... came early put dress...lol

Online school... kids even login. ones do... pay attention.

I think statistics were...~30% kids actually work. 

Like said generation lacks type intelligence. They're better home quite apparent nobody knows fuck manage it.

I live Taiwan managed coronavirus near perfectly. zero domestic cases 250 days still sourcing &amp; developing vaccines. Probably so, think that's right decision. worth I'm probably one last/lowest priority groups itchin fly. eligible them.

The point offered you, hesitate. beneficial vaccinated. pose less public hazard potentially less strain healthcare system, happen one unlucky ones get sick. There's public benefit vaccinating yourself. people really thrive culture hate. First != biggest even pie chart dramatic effect mean Americans cared school children decades. 



That country school shootings weekends years. inventory low rates too. lot people idea. First time buyers squeezed people coming equity. fucked? What’s morbidity rate? Median measure average, along mean mode. ""Average"" mean mean, correct call measures ""average"". comment technically correct as-is.

Also mean mean lol. LOL... place total dump. NIMBYs care that, they'll take reason get shut down.  That's shitty surprised. Nurses treated horribly right now, matter are, matter whether you’re travel nurse not. won’t surprised many leave field. worth pay, way they’re treated. Bible say judge? seem quite judgemental him. civil. know that. definitely said nursing school told everyone going working respiratory therapist. nursing require schooling? tried dozen different combinations try make snarky joking response felt hollow. There's much stake turning shit. 

To healthcare workers there, thoughts coming weeks sincerely hope Americans beat odds, stayed safe, made lives living hell right Christmas. Welding people inside myth busted half year ago. still believe it. Obviously dumb. hate fence sitting equivocation. According him, political parties equally awful. another 3-6 months general public option.  almost year. US anything like part world fear them. Nobody cares social distancing whatsoever. always crowded everywhere go too. People travelling too.  I'm vented sedated, film myself. time goes meds devices longer available, becomes likely know I'm dying chance need do. places allow visitors still, sparingly many restrictions. health system health system basis. do, don't. good. please. I've wearing mask public since March, what's months? addition reasons mentioned article (good read btw), confirmed cases going go free testing goes away Dec 1st given many hospitals capacity would expect ""hospitalization"" numbers relatively flat. means losing two leading indicators deaths well ability identify isolate contagious individuals. YES! ! bitches crazy. Carry on. Look I'm one hypocrites. needed celebrate. mask entire time. I'd again. Okay reading agree you. forget extras/stipulations time focus American people really need. It’s following experts unlike Europe don’t open borders time option 6-8 months in... buy these? can't seem find any. Already applied cancer treatment. Happy say donated cancer tissue research.  Cheers dude, thing late May! I'm \_still\_ parents' place. kinda weird depressing, definitely better alone. also get pissed feel gaslit hearing people taking thing seriously, including people know personally... hope feel safe good time folks. Also: Elon Musk calls high school inventors pedophiles reason. bad idiots, holidays, deal  years.  Well, know fact DOW 30,000 last long now... Ehh general public won’t access late February earliest. Many many people get infected die til then. What's wrong Chinese following post China? hand, following post China talk shit? payroll? achieve herd immunity immune 3 6 months anyway...? makes 40 minute interview director vaccine development Texas Children's Hospital ""stupid article""?  I'm baffled, sort unnecessary havoc inbound interview? Idiots. Especially see many people unemployment get paid nothing. would thought virus family literally called seasonal colds would also seasonal?

Tell Texas Florida. first wave crested July.. California two peaks: April much higher peak July..
NY/NJ/CT/RI/MA meanwhile one peak April.


So seasonality Covid big unknown fairly strong evidence pointing ""not-very-seasonal""...  never heard expression like it

Absolutely fucking science. exciting see evolution mens vaccines stack traditional types (such Oxford's) China refused ship it. can’t blame people nervous first vaccinate. know plenty people “you go first let know” camp...  even evidence pandemic ending spring like people think. publish infowars articles next?

Some things need study. infectious virus kills people make people interact people less, less deaths related virus. news followup. 

Next time use outdated news  don’t think media outlets reporters go COVID unit hospital record patients dying COVID. Even friends family can’t visit loved ones hospital COVID risk contracting themselves, unknowingly it, spreading staff non-COVID patients.

If person worked hospital would risking entire career get footage would likely change nothing. fuck’s sake Fair enough. apologies assuming didn’t children. opinion valid although public school daughters go pretty happy with. lucky suppose. Fair enough. Would agree would illogical right immoral require travel ""we know"" tf getting 9% from? think 1% number accurate either go estimates mass asymptomatic cases never caught. Also, public often refuses respect personal space lot essential workers, sometimes touching, pulling mask yell request close. much respect space pandemic, deadly situation involved. short sighted small minded way think. Try imagine farther future account factors. Basically read sci fi. Bingo total GARBAGE good news. Low death rates, vaccines way, people spending time family friends holidays, law enforcement enforcing private gathering mandates, etc dude slinging shade like it’s holy water Palm Sunday lately. know ""monkaS"" is, that's cool! Funny, number matches birthmark.... Yup. One went private school one too. That’s fine, long never complained outdoor gatherings. Could please provide source this? I'd like share friend Shhh.... insult head Taliban West. China worship? There's proof cases China dating back early December. Denialism?  Fun fact: HIV positive people die virus. So, guess could say died with* HIV/AIDS.

In words, fuck bullshit. That's exactly evil scientist would say West failed react

Not us failed act. Australia New Zealand did. We're enjoying health. I'm going away beach weekend family, extremely unlikely anything worry now. He's Catholic, espouse Catholic values least 28 days. Even got vaccine. people think asked wear mask imposition freedoms *really* going like rules jail prison.

Now that's going imposition freedoms. Right queue information police... LTC stats heartbreaking. know uncle Sunnybrooke’s veteran hospital 4+ years fantastic care - yet always outbreaks flu. One person would get would go lockdown. Sometimes despite best precautions would spread vets would pass away. 

""As Monday, 528 active cases among residents 467 among staff."" staff go place place, spread continues. 

We really need get vaccine workers, doctors staff, provide better care.  lol, lotta cutting edge research happening ""humansarefree.com""? Naive? I'm posting article that's informative conversational Dean Medicine Baylor.

Since listen, says vaccines idea different technology, get whichever one offer upgrade road need to. 

He saying people impatient. I'd rather $8000 week mental problems instead $800 Really? We're going quote man thinks he's conversations invisible superhero? What's next, head flat earth society? might single extreme case happend early stage everyone panic. use single case represent 1.4 billion Chinese.
 Besides, might method control trafic flow. Normally several gates apartment block China. pandemic, apartment block gates leave one gate flow control. Normally done lock. again, single case panic period let’s see. AUS, NZ, Taiwan, Japan, 2nd wave: Germany, Austria, Alsace... vs US Sweden. right.

Hm. Somehow domain name smells turd. be. is.

Language funny way. expressing ideals truths, empower them. statement like ""The USA stands freedom, wanting increase incarceration"" makes sense. prescribing detail change things discussed, rather facts stand.

But can't help wonder sometimes less effective. Covid-19 partisan political. is. legality homosexuality political. is. Whether Nesle able buy water access region dehydrate local towns farms political. is.

Where recognizing political reality take precedence idealistic descriptions pushing something come true changing public perspective?

I'm sure, USA feel like hit point LOT cattegories. Son disappointed. logic, high risk individuals also deserve suffer herd immunity greater good? orthodox) piss non-Catholics, pope anti-Catholic representative w

Catholic teaching says Pope god's representative voice earth. must mean Catholic, God telling progressive things. Actually is... education there's push keep schools open. push school free daycare parents, without can't work. parents work usual, economic hit would insane. much disagree schools open virus POV, economic POV really important. last couple weeks throw trend spiking death, weeks highest death count Wednesday. repeat long lockdown mate short one like SA. benefit exists open discourse. advocate deplatforming ideas disagree advocating censoring ideas. History shown slippery slope eventually start silencing agree with. 

I find CNN MSNBC propagandists, don’t advocate deplatforming them. Strange New Zealand cases COVID-19.  China claim ""zero covid cases""...

Maybe Hiroshima Nagasaki like event makes Chernobyl seem like nothing that's statistics work. would thought virus family literally called seasonal colds would also seasonal? laugh Melbournian. moderna vaccine needs stored temperature chickenpox vaccine. basically every doctors office America store it.  Except allow face shields instead masks CDD guidelines. saw 4 employees wearing face shields last time went. interview Dr. Martha Nelson, published NIH epidemiologist. They'll believe stupidity never stop. Somehow hard trust website called ""humans free"". 

I sense agenda here.

The results Asia show lockdowns effective. West failed react time lockdowns continue slow spread.


This seems faulty analysis fit agenda.  healthcare workers going get it; emergency authorization, one making mandatory. It’s also massively improbable adverse event would take meaningful chunk workforce; clinical trials already went 40,000 people. worst vaccine mistakes history (like giving live polio virus 1950’s) mortality rate around 1 million. living US pandemic year gives mortality rate 1 1000. kids? truly cannot see benefit capitalism wiping damned near 300,000 Americans. Usually ""experts"" tell overthink wait, usually best overthink wait Yeah nah. Melbourne zero community spread nearly month, states started opening internal borders. We're pretty determined keep healthy. banned forever trying prey covid victims lowest low concentration camps? MASSIVE argument herd immunity Sweden: **comparatively** little (not even wearing masks, shutting schools, etc) yet something held spread virus (E.g death rates kept steadily declining, reaching near zero late July)

The argument held early July Sept, clearly valid anymore: whatever held spread summer, holding anymore :-( Enough make dealers stage intervention get quit smoking much crack. someone without strong science literacy, absorbing interpreting graph data COVID-19 infections may difficult someone dementia Lewy bodies interpret face.

Interesting article. Nah, we've going guy years. He's really cool, Overwatch Funkos shelves glasses (though game he's ever played). knew take wrong way, usual cracked joke it. literally! even bother issue coworkers wear N95 surgical, glasses, strict vitamin regiment decontamination procedure come home. work congregate care lock Psych facility one wears masks 3rd shift. cameras.

Thanks pointing cons. may need freezers years. really “one-time use” situation here. . cases mild initial infections didn’t produce enough immunity, leading second infection. vaccine normally create stronger immune response.

No, said platforms protections publishers have, that's reason affect public discourse differently. That's difference currently claim interact information disseminate. change based ignorance never good thing.

They claim basically government responses completely ineffectual depressing covid death rates government's responses (i.e., severity index containment health index) strongly correlated second factorial axis (Figures 2, 4). death rate Covid-19 correlated axis. Therefore, death rate appears linked responses third axis shows relationship Covid-19 mortality longitude well obesity sedentarity (Figures 4, 5). American countries higher obesity rate higher Covid-19 mortality rate; Asian countries lower obesity rates lower Covid-19 mortality correlation matrix (Figure 6) shows Covid-19 mortality rate positively correlated group variables composed inactive lifestyle (r = 0.46, p &lt; 10−6), obesity rate (r = 0.55, p &lt; 10−11), GDP (r = 0.40, p &lt; 10−7), economic support index (r = 0.31, p &lt; 10−3), life expectancy (r = 0.50, p &lt; 10−11), burden mortality due CVD (r = 0.33, p &lt; 10−3), cancer (r = 0.47, p &lt; 10−9), deviation latitude 0 (r = 0.41, p &lt; 10−3). mortality rate due Covid-19 negatively correlated another group variables composed mortality rate infectious diseases (r = −0.50, p &lt; 10−9), progression life expectancy (r = −0.37, p &lt; 10−4), longitude (r = −0.36, p &lt; 10−3), deviation optimum temperature (r = −0.39, p &lt; 10−5), UV index (r = −0.37, p &lt; 10−43). significant correlation deviation optimum humidity (r = 0.03, p = 0.52), containment health index (r = 0.07, p = 0.51), original stringency index (r = 0.07, p = 0.36), population size (r = −0.05, p = 0.35). negative correlation also relates obesity longitude (r = −0.33, p &lt; 10−4). understand requirements vaccines travelling always thing They’re expecting first doses January, Trudeau saying we’ll see Americans, Brits, Indians, Germans get doses December us. part, Canada start getting doses around time EU countries also aren’t domestic producers vaccines. expected side effect hyper-capitalistic culture.

(Mostly enforced Muslim women though) infallible statement. Jeez. you? sore throat fatigue month ago, get test. (Missouri) Lol... one favorites.  feel like every day reddit...😅😅 Yeah I’m sure can, share interest... basically said:

g = ƒ(2t) = (2t)2 = 4t2 = 4ƒ, g = 4ƒ.

What else could say? Seriously. people fucking insane. quite lot Chinese government top officials, even presidents, engineering degree. Eh, I'm investing companies may bit reopening occurs. Like movie theaters, sports stuff. Source? It’s forced. goes ahead either choose travel Australia pay 14 day quarantine fee Manufacturers, universities, healthcare since legalization, weed companies. factually false. It’s “foreseeable future”. 

There endgame rough estimate mathematically approach immunity. number falls anywhere spring fall/winter. Powerful video good doctor. certainly dangerous... we're approaching wrong.

If 49 recovery rate 99.93%.... crazy good. course drops there.

What need offer ""optional completely paid lockdown"" anyone 49 wants needs it.

Everyone else keep moving. would cost less work better several months felt focusing IFR/CFR mortality numbers tells part story. think chronic disease result Covid infection something concerned about. 

I'll keep fingers crossed ""Just disappears, like miracle""; still feel something worry about. Decided go hospital emergency today. Seriously badly bruised throbbing pain, sure fracture.

After round x-rays, thankfully nothing broken.

Total time visit 2 hours.

Final bill: What? I'm Canadian.

Many things understand U.S., opposition socialized healthcare one them. one news me, watching forum lately due working hard. confirm, one next window beautiful hardy. Can't imagine someone say health benefit, though. Oh, wait.... would border closures change death rate per million? 

I’m sure understand you’re reading. I'm Saudi see budget every year, we've running government deficit years (since 2017 think) COVID getting worse, treasury able handle forever. might give hints outsider vaccine get rid covid...it slows down? like flu medicine cure it..? Oh they'll find something wait. mean Mickey Mouse plans companies provide low level employees can’t afford?

No don’t think insult much insulted yourself. make look stuoid, did. think people may relax little bit vaccine rolled out. Right people aren’t maybe going indoor restauarants/bars live parents visit frequently it’s told protect them. parents vaccinated, may feel take risks aren’t hurting parents recover get it.

Advocating change based ignorance never good thing. harms are, identified you, would harm ""discourse"", effects tangible clearly articulable way. ""People get dumber nazis can't post youtube videos."" Ok sure.


You fallen victim thing I’m talking about. comment says right almost like law.. should... changed. See there?


Maybe, that’s topic right reality situation. wan argue hypotheticals, go elsewhere.


Are argument lacks nuance, quite frankly reeks lack real world experience understanding words, intelligent argument, advocates fascism. 

Would agree ideas freely exchanged open marketplace ideas? Please cough masks reportedly good protection vaccine, seeing cases explode regardless. Thus masks lockdowns needed foreseeable future. Yea wasn’t h1n1 virus close bad Covid infection rate asymptomatic populace? Smooth move slick... thats talking about.

We talking mortality. 

If kept reading.....

-Rapid border closures, full lockdowns, wide-spread testing associated COVID-19 mortality per million people-   Moderna. Modern+RNA. whole time, holy shit. actually know sucks trying get sweet anti capitalism karma? Also I'm pretty sure health insurance atleast factory workers decent since negotiated union. That's right assault threat violence battery actually hitting someone. Ah, wait ICUs full.  Oh new line election over? It’s gonna interesting 5, 10, 15yrs.. witness long term effects covid. top that, lot revisionist history. Yeah. thought good hung best friend. work home, order stuff instacart. Never ever go store. read chicago doctor said 2/3rds covid patients got sick hanging someone knew, covid. told gotta stop hanging out. sucks gotta part. Ventilators? Next time tell staff get involved stay sight screw teachers right? legit truth. One blow head kill quickly. I’ve seen happen firsthand. Also, I’m MD. time someone tries strike another person head, especially weapon, honestly consider tantamount attempted murder. 

If guy came store clear intent physically threaten intimidate me, would reaching holster. least, hand would grip. isn’t backing clear intent assault least make *think* he’s going assault, would draw tell someone call police immediately. 

These types comments typically bring host disagreement “pulling gun” unnecessarily emasculating insults one “fight like man” whatever. don’t care, entertain trolls.

Be safe there. lot studies work many serial killers 1950 2000 linked WW2 stress back then, think big serge due stress caused 2008. Hey guys let's get infected virus know little protect virus *Yep. I'm bitches, mother fucker.*

I love you! think that’s relatively low pandemic like event. 

To quote Harvard article 1918: number weeks practically entire hospital given care influenza cases. Every medical bed half surgical beds occupied influenza cases. remaining beds concentrated surgical medical cases must needs remain hospital admitted emergency cases. Surgical Staff loaned Medical four house officers care influenza cases, generously surgeons curtailed work minimum. Without help Surgical Staff would unable meet needs situation.

I realize one hospital, 20% especially medical airlift, allows rapid transport hospitals open, doesn’t sound like kind event.   Okay then... talking r/coronavirus article spread it... I’m waiting. Mask wearing traveling holidays precautions COVID. We’ve seen one side treats information. talking then. OC everyone dumpy neighborhood wears mask. Traveling nicer areas OC, one wears mask. interesting much compliance vary one county, based town's demographics. Going prison dumbass reason don’t, no. I’ve seen 4 states I’ve lived throughout life (2 mostly liberal, 2 mostly conservative) pretty much thing: people either cautious not, ever since first lockdown. difference I’m noticing dumb luck ran out. Before, places weren’t harder hit shit outside summer. dumb fucks crowding beaches, outdoor weddings backyard BBQs crowding bars, house parties traveling warmer states party, it’s spreading. 

But people know who’ve careful still careful. 

So idk. Maybe people easing up. That’s I’m seeing. I’m seeing stupid people less shit well ventilated areas. Makes sense  respiratory issue gives right endanger others. pandemic already here. called climate change. thought covid bad, wait excuses 90 degree Minnesota winters start flying people's mouth's Except New York. Cuomo trust FDA. bad New York. Maybe promoting book picking Emmy awards he'll time review FDA application. hear he's 'working' Thanksgiving now.

[Gov. Cuomo: ‘I’m Going Trust Federal Government’s Opinion’ Potential Approved COVID-19 Americans like pew pew pew get way. Better Groundhogs 2020. experience similar yours, far away xin fa di (Chaoyang District).

We asked stay away new development area, still able go work.

In early stages nascent outbreak, testing capabilities given closer areas, distant locations tested 1-2 weeks later.

Fortunately, measures effective time. Yes, long lasting effect shopping experience. Costco exclusiv club morons :) supposed wrap around head, way around.  I'm teacher boss wondering kind proof would need get teacher phase rolls out. Thanks explaining two three! Either way, never moving Kentucky (or Ohio). scientific literature going stop me, can't read! Louisiana makes tough rules. make masks mandatory every single state 4 year prison sentence life imprisonment indirectly killed someone giving covid, sounds fair me. What's high number particular illness? 

Why think 20% low? seems astronomical. company makes masks now, box BYD masks Costco right next me. approval N95s delayed, paid back agreed upon amount money failure meet deadlines. multiplying infection numbers 1.7%. number good 4 week deaths, hospitals start running beds. Nothing sob about. Medical directives practical just-in-case. sobbing starts *don't* DNR. case, family left making difficult decisions behalf someone whose wishes may known. Ask know :D

You never know hit bus. Look jurisdiction's forms discussions need to. There's $7 billion money appropriated testing CARES act administration spent reason. read law, assume still available Biden wants change policy. Perhaps make point well. mean standing mask wearing heated environment (people clearly taking pretty seriously), probably worth it.
Balance good idea, context dependent. Masks hot button issue many folks. sure benefits standing situation. Haha, nobody believes arguing good faith. Japan doesn’t fight virus luxurious style, wealthy Japanese people write lot words defending argument know wrong, quite astounding. There's towns 80% infection. Every southern hemisphere temperate country got hit winter started. Even NZ struggled mid winter outbreak. I'm sorry convinced incorrect argument can't change that. I'm sure want do. always abundantly clear wrong fit data even clearer now. Ok. Say I'm former smoker, also another underlying health issue.

I work eat, job public-facing. 

How isolate exactly? I'm surprised, complain mine lot lately too. :) frustrates many people really know going likely never really talked anyone China want talk China like totally evil.

btw, thanks sharing story June outbreak. Nah. doubt 4 5 weeks Thanksgiving seeing 3000+ dying day. get point 5000 dying day, getting completely shut down, martial law style. way 5000 people dying day equate 100s hospitals country space. 50% chance I'm dolphin. dunno, would show it’s clothes mandatory masks people get vaccine. think people can't shittier, stumble upon comment. Everything I've seen teachers phase two behind two part phase one. Make look pretty Exactly. I'm actually finding I'm hacking much. gotten sore throat anything far. feel like air better around.

If people really understood life potentially fucked can’t fully function, may take seriously.

I mean, parent, imagine able take care yourself... even kids?

This may sleeping giant real aftermath Covid coming months. Thus far, things looking promising. I’m hopeful something done soon hundreds thousands, possibly millions. remember zombie apocalypse, they're ones going pretend get bit hide barricade inside them. Anytime wear paper masks eyes swell up. can't wear masks bendable metal piece. keeps riding pokeing eyes. know tried masks maybe keep it. tried several different types cloth masks found one feels comfortable. 3 layers made polyester or/and cotton bamboo viscose lining. also use mask extenders. Unfortunately, took money time found mask wear. Transportation workers, emergency services, grocery workers.

There's quite industries I'd list prior school teachers. favor stop forming worldview based upon crap internet. we're seeing right effects already control spread Halloween gatherings. Thanksgiving travel 10%, next three weeks going much, much worse. PCR tests don’t. look up. It’s publicly review. Try Chinese population first. hide side effects world sell Dude, wtf on? I've going costco years saying makes sense. put near working class? Wtf talking about, lol. MASSIVE fucking store, they'll build space exists. would located serve ""the working class""? Downtown? 

Not mention member use pharmacy, happens cheapest anywhere. standalone stores selling storebrand, case can't afford costco membership. wonder many lives could saved democrats republicans made bipartisan effort get everyone wear mask socially distance? died lightning strike covid positive There's already multiple strains like flu.

National Biotec Group Co. submitted application Chinese regulators, reported state media Xinhua Finance Wednesday, citing parent company Sinopharm’s vice general manager Shi Shengyi. application likely includes interim data company’s Phase III human testing conducted Middle East South America. necessarily respect, may comply. GDPR compliance hairy expensive thing. Since part target market... making investment. time Christmas! mom works somewhere masks need worn customers always ask “why don’t say anything maskless customers?” tell say anything exact reason. Higher management say something want. person wearing mask point likely irrational unpredictable. much much likely armed. It’s worth safety tell wear mask. individual actor never change systemic problems.

Rosa Parks says thread someone killed asking someone wear mask.

wasn't killed, shot calf. clearly though Oh god. 

SO FUCKING WHAT? 

My point still stands. 

No. They’re acting like people act. don’t give shit people gunna regardless. 100% fault federal government. San Diego unfortunately. One lady said medical exemption harassing simply asked, ""hey, mask fall off?"" public transportation workers. grocery workers. There's tons people continue world pandemic. Also top 3 urbanised populations world, 85% population 3 cities, 95% population living within 50km coast. 

If Australia’s island status great, what’s Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Phillipines, UK, Sri Lanka?

Covid got away us. federal government paid people stay home, states closed borders enforced serious lockdowns.

I’d like point tiny population comparison comes tiny resources comparison US thing did. wealthiest nation Earth. this? One persons **27 years old**... disagree. $500 serious chunk change many people even though far perfect system serve deterrent sure b? That's understanding... stupid whoever was. Someone's life could threatened depending exposes. thought gougers overcharging NIOSH-approved respirators... M@GA death cult T4ump. Fact free p0litics fact free world leading people's demise. feeling large number covid deaths current former smokers. That's want see stats filling hospital beds. people need isolated. rocket science. common theme. part natural selection. What's computer expert commenting covid-19? saying smart he's doctor. That's like doctor commenting stock market sadly sick country. No, also inspection teams highway exits, one allowed leave town without nucleic acid negative certificate.

Beijing xin fa di June outbreak like I'm starting think everyone Thanksgiving anyway idea denial phase grief actually acceptance phase. people say, ""It might last Thanksgiving grandma,"" actually mean subconsciously. everyone expects unavoidable deluge winter can't bothered try fight anymore.

Scary. literally go NBA game states now. go concert like before. living restrictions whether like not. Keep putting blame government don’t act like citizens aren’t blame either ongoing disaster there. respiratory issues hike mask—with elevation gain. 

A face shield secondary layer meant add another layer protection mask eye protection. stand alone protection wearer near wearer. 

If great challenge wearing mask, require nasal cannula, probably good idea stay stores whatever need delivered. 

Let’s honest, vast majority people anti-mask don’t breathing issues. attitude issues. 

People actual breathing issues part scared shitless going go out, acquire something need like food toilet paper end ER intubated days later. 

Wearing mask minor thing. get creates humidity. hike full heart-rate, wearing mask, brim ball cap gets soaked wash cap hike.

Even COVID, would wear gator zero temps, especially wind, prevent frost nip nose. (First degree burns.) 

The gator gets wet. Now, mask gets wet. It’s annoying. I’d rather wear mask. However, like don’t want first degree burns nose, don’t want end alone hospital bed upside shitting myself. 

So, distance. wear mask. wear eye protection. feel like huge dork. given direction numbers fact multiple vaccines way, cam wear mask months. 

Most importantly, people worn masks, maintained appropriate distance, adapted small lifestyle changes incredibly short amount time pandemic ultimately be, could lived somewhat regular lives... Like people many countries Southern Hemisphere get to.

But, no. Despite fact people lot Asia already wear masks time, North America wearing mask kind assault personal freedoms. putting seatbelts, wearing helmets riding, probably half-dozen things meant assure safety wearer met great deal resistance. 

Anyway, people legitimately trouble breathing, especially loved ones, wear mask public vaccine deployed.

The vaccine.

Dear god, we’re completely fucked. Lol....After Wuhan virus outbreak went hand thoudands pro PRC minion mushroomed social media platforms. job follow Corona virus related posts, come mases spread misinformation, propaganda leave negative remark comments made Xijinpin China. account one them. Look votes comment similar comments get Reddit. naive understand votes coming?.

BTW need Payroll speak right one imapcted virus. Sweden probably less half cases detected. took 3-4 months ramping testing people small symptoms allowed test themselves. that, doctor ordered tests done.. Yeah, I'm unlikely lose job due covid. even I'd get unemployment state, unlikely case there'll time can't service mortgage I'd call bank, explain situation, they'd ask long collect interest only, need loan get time. Hides occssional pimple rather well too. put two two together... username connected anything ""bad"" post plate, find want ride conspiracy carousel, here's food Nov 16, 2020, reviewing results study Milan. 

Also interest, study coronavirus bats Northwest Italy (You'll never guess Milan located!) 2017: roommate decided go drive towns visit family Thanksgiving 🙃 originally super tight COVID protocols house, stayed home 2 weeks got tested going, idea family approaches it. really business guess paranoia getting me. want make through, I've lucky far I'm scared loved ones. wish people paid attention this. get frequent shortness breath, light headedness, fatigue genetic issue, I’m like, want problem. infectious virus spread far wide left unchecked. ok 1.5 million Americans dying Covid-19? That's 0.6%.

0.8% add 600 thousands more. different, better worse clear meaningful way. focused social distancing instead masks suffered everyone else COVID deaths economy. Maybe we’ll see difference retrospect years claiming either win loss way early. 
I don’t believe held example US though, respective populations way different mentality. Around May probably Ha. WTF think? true. Ask wrong person wear mask get shot.  clear, nothing he’s said new. Catholic Church always maintained acceptance gay men women. draw line *behavior*. gay, need celibate practicing Catholic state Grace. 

This stance entire child abuse bullshit pushed Episcopal Church. love faith, couldn’t stand corruption systemic discrimination. wow shooting someone non-self defense scenario ""felonious assault"" Thats attempted murder first world states. There's percentage population recommended vaccines either age health reasons. happens them? missed part hospitals overloaded. understand that, care people able access necessary health care.

Also, where’s source figure? Largely depends many table. I’m skipping year though. This! read story recently (it happened covid times still) woman stood middle aged woman store harassing her. short, woman like threw jar head almost killed her. horrible head injury PTSD encounter. really worth ignore crazies. People take gap years university. Also push keep open large majority altered schedule make thst possible. say arent long term consequences closed schools pretty ridiculous recall seeing 10% number it’s obviously true. TSA checkpoint numbers less half last year. also state license plates?

&amp;#x200B;

You need catch make highly risky get caught. normal timeline, would masked men shooting.. Americans really paying price taking virus seriously. Would love see higher property tax second, third, etc. homes. also needs heavier taxes AirBNB. stuff control needs reigned big time flu COVID two different types viruses. COVID around year spike protein hasn’t mutated among humans. coronavirus “proofreading” built in. Yeah, entire thing depressing. We’re dealing pandemic fairly easy deal with. Wear mask, keep distance avoid gatherings vaccine rolls out. tiniest sacrifices keep everyone safe keep economy going, many people can’t even that. It’s exhausting seeing bad is, wouldn’t ever want experience first hand ICU. 

My sister RN (Canada) people bitching something simple wearing piece fabric partying months also made question wants continue nursing. didn’t sign this. People acting like they’re sent die overseas, it’s absurd fuelled pessimism truly fucked humanity is. :( That's pretty massive jump comment said lol. GOOD. bet even wake 4am day. would guess.

When reaching vaccination threshhold start putting place throw brakes they'll likely kind plan fly citizens vaccinated countries stranded places without vaccine access back home Number 5 include young people comorbities like heart disease obesity. transition period. first step easing relax mandate applies inside public buildings shops. Sorry dumb question vaccine distributed supposedly couple weeks U.S, one it? moderna vaccine? Pfizer vaccine? don’t think I’ve heard one I’d like know I’m informed. 67-yr old man shooting someone calf expected read. Seriously, anti-masker? Thanks best. fucked country. general Public well general Public. Meaning everyone, least normally get vaccine. End factory farming. People need seriously eat less meat unhealthy humans every way. GOOD fix stuff put broken thing back move wrong. expected nurses teachers unions force economy shut people refused get ppe follow health guidance.

Their martyrdom noble, walked off, we'd get message.  hire armed guards? Grocery stores city hired guards Glocks pandemic due homeless problem. I’m sure they’ll gladly take anti-makers too. Apparently Rite Aid reversed decision. really matter people take vaccine able come back normal keep dying. Fine me. okay long stock market broke 30,000 points record. that's important lives apparently... Everytime someone bitches COVID say this:

""You think bad? Wait H7N9 eventually jumps wipes third humanity"" YES  Oo story time! could use justice comments dumbest take I’ve ever seen sub. Almost like “stuffing” people together? Tell it. I'm California working military base contagious fuckwits isn’t bad thing... people following restrictions they’ve received full vaccine. death rate basement levels, hospitalizations. reason to. risk life?

Because we're sick fucking tired assholes flaunting law / basic human fucking decency. past 4 years nothing shithead snowflake crybabies bitching moaning every little thing adults room ""take high road"" get shit kicked them.  


No. Fuck that. We're done. take low road ""take high road"", stomp move on. 

Yeah, there's chance ill get shot, means showing 3 assholes store someone stand bullshit worth it. They've dropped? others risen? link article another article event says victim asked store employees call 911 bothered to. employees get trouble refusing? WTF?!! Sorry, ive reading lots (bad) news happening US cant help think head ""What's wrong you, guys? U world leader, everyone looked US 20 years ago. happened since? Unreal!"" put another mask it. Yes know life situation say that?  think several ethical logistical reasons would insanely stupid

It would something like vaccination card stamp whatever personal ID carry country. Maybe even like cool little plastic brand heats embosses seal ID Yes, am. building except without P100 respirator since March. probably don’t go within 10 feet anyone else times per week, outside.

I don’t virus, respirator helps keep way. Also, wear glasses never touch anything without using hand sanitizer immediately afterwards. Ok. Almost everyone Catholic (and even good portion cafeteria Catholics) understand papal infallibility actually means. think anything says supposed considered infallible. vaccine that's ""Ford tough""? That's something want. Also, need sure parents actually it, know many got little sick, never got tested assume they’ve it. Choosing take particular vaccine age group 99.6% recovery rate exposed antivax?

This one takes term seriously anymore. random idea would possible people go another state get it? Like state one last really want could go one get vaccinated? idea whether would work it’s random idea thought correct I’m wrong.  always holes around disinfection process large volume import despite ongoing pandemic. workers carried pig heads warehouse testing fully protected (It hard carry frozen food then). Mercers

I knew Matt Marisha shady shit. means shed masks entirely operate completely normal outside brief inconvenience flashing vaccine card establishments couple years re-opening?

I'm percentage anti-vaxxers across population. Maybe overlap anti-maskers, sure. prepare deliver vaccinations begin think reopening society - sports events, concerts, theatres, full restaurants, etc, think case vaccination passport. Want tickets football game concert? V-passport?

It approach school districts taking: child vaccinated, he/she cannot start public school system.

Anti-vaxxers need held accountable choices. Otherwise extend misery delay whole recovery. Thoughts? So, authoritarian works well control pandemic. support say something like Xi looks like Winnie Pooh social credit score drops can’t travel Chinese New Year always projection. updated information doesn’t suggest that. It’s prediction that’s based anything. It’s incalculable.  thing lot ""99.7% survival"" people seem understand. treat IFR static figure actually highly dynamic. Rabies 100% survivable get proper treatment, way argue IFR close 0%.

Survival rates extremely contingent getting adequate hospital care. Additionally, healthcare workers spread thin, also increases mortality rates every cause death well. immortal words Tina Fey Amy Poehler, ""Bitches get shit done!"" think form swine flu could wrong.  I'm sure information seek interweb ripe critique. know union guys know (not ford, plumbing electrical unions) talk benefits good are. Let know find big bad business healthcare injustice I'll change mind Ford you. Yes think. people one place means there’s bigger chance people getting since one gets, spread people would able states smaller populations. them, yes. think comfortable regular N95 “smells” like filtration regular N95. Don’t brand handy, wife said FDA list, whatever is. CEO executives listened objective facts made decision put employees first, that's rare commendable! Team america right, it’s 9/11 x 1000! guess get sick i'll assume covid get cheaper antibody test after. pretend never it... (don't want listed pre-existing condition) Agreed. hate wearing mask too, damn, worth hassle wear one what's best dad that's matters. kind help video conferences family, that's exactly everyone right anyways! hope father wonderful Thanksgiving together! Stay safe sane well! Someone vaccinated infectious. statement assumes contracting virus vaccinated factually incorrect. vaccine distributed amongst huge population short period time. Also full length someone recovered virus entirely certain, can't go around trying infect people got virus 6 months ago. This. People lose minds Facebook moves “Like” button Safeway moves Ritz crackers Aisle 6 aisle 9. We’re expecting make major changes daily habits without enforcement, positive negative. hmm weird! Does[ wrong, polling getting harder do, but...
 
There good youtubes years polls actually pretty close normal margin error except situations (like maine &amp; wisconsin). time done counting Biden probably 5 points nationally. ""Hands off"" inaccurate. ""Pro-virus"" also criticized checkpoints set Cheyenne River Sioux, well Native American tribes state. May, asked Trump administration help intervene compromise allow checkpoints tribal roads state federal ones within reservations.

Noem, like Trump exception among political leaders worldwide specifically took action knowledge would increase number people died, discernible benefit (not even political). common law call depraved heart murder. people dying covid hospitals denying doubt help completely. country. 

I expect civil disturbances globally. 

That Turchin guy onto something wonder math like ""we might get 20% popularity maneuver, however likely lose 1% constituents, nbd"" humidifier theoretically reduce indoor transmission likelihood helping air particles get heavier ground; especially low humidity environment.

This seems like ""mostly false"" opposed ""pants fire"" Maybe build wall around town! keep virus out. Gross wait long. completely false. 

You make good living skilled trades technical school. fact shortage folks 

Life walk park.. hard harder stupid They've recommended booster 3-4 weeks following initial shot, thats it. So, can't help think, another eventual ""moving goalposts"" one vaccine link created 7 cases 

I think little dishonest. example, Finland alone, 90% new narcolepsy cases (150+ people) single year taken vaccine.

I PhD dealt HIV transmission, good understanding risk. know risk probably small, virtually zero. right risks fully known. people right refuse take vaccine feel confident side effects. Yeah that’s good point. don’t want rely Covid immunity. meant if, say, 50% SD already Covid recently, theory need vaccines get last 20% covered. short term—obviously want vaccinated soon can. 

I agree point point time argument. Like right now, distribute vaccine? time set distribution logistics severity surges could change. Population contrast relatively stable. also think vaccine takes ~6 weeks effective (2 doses + 2 weeks last dose?) doesn’t sound viable “stop spread” measure.

I like proportional it’s easy make fair. Severity virus spread subjective—is based current cases, percent population, rate cases, rate deaths, etc. Unfortunately also consider potential metric exploited politically (e.g., people lobbying certain definition severe get doses sooner). Population data relatively static available there’s little chance someone could argue, say, ND suddenly bigger population TX. Slowly ripping band-aid got us today. 1 step forward, 2 steps back would rather catching covid cholera yellow fever thousand times.

Nobody entire world would disagree this. Like, I'm sure interpreted comment even mildly suggesting otherwise. two diseases absolutely devastating.  turkish official website still shows symptomatic cases.

This Minister liar.

"" news conference Sept 30, Koca said government sharing number COVID-19 positive cases symptoms. ""

"" Turkey start declaring number asymptomatic COVID-19 cases Oct. 15, health minister said "" 

"" “We share cross sectional screening results even though show symptoms. report World Health Organisation (WHO).” still data watch daily cases, sry ""patients"". 

worldometers pulling official number turkish gov site: 6,814 ""patients"". 

While Koca said "" Daily number positive cases 28,351 6,814 isolated, tracked treated health institutions, "" 6.8k cases symptoms, 21.5k without symptoms. "" on, reveal asymptomatic COVID-19 cases daily briefing "", like already said October!  Wear masks socially distance. Quit throwing parties weddings huge Thanksgiving dinners, quit packing bars. Pretty fucking simple things decent human able do. Unfortunately, we're learning huge number people country decent human beings. wonder username /r/Canada plans study effective mRNA vaccines stopping asymptomatic transmission, would data available? people listen mandates advisories Loving this. Thanx much. share know many people miss informed think know truth. Great site, need put emphasis main page FAQs people receive mRNA vaccine might experience flu-like symptoms truly severe aches pains. Right now, information reads like symptoms barely problem. emphasized yesterday day CNN, example, recipients lot pain doctors need prepare explain patients fear people idea symptoms might go back second injection suddenly feel sick receiving first one.

Additionally, might want point somewhere mRNA vaccines designed primarily point prevent severe symptoms result death. necessarily prevent infection spread infection. also good link yesterday financial subreddit delved problems technology. 

You also link enough sources, including peer-reviewed sources hard data ones.

Lastly, hurt provide definition anti-vaxxer also explain difference critical thinker anti-vaxxer. Far many people clump critical thinkers take vaccines believe want wait see happens anti-vaxxers hate vaccines never take them.  Thank you. I'll edit mine say well. Covid driving record numbers obviously. issue suddenly spiked before. 

I get pedantric point nothing else driving record hospitalizations almost certainly covid record pushing higher nothing else increasing it.

Thank service. Right, saying getting conflicting results odds positive. *inferred* *implications*

Whether intended not, made them. 

Now know. want. know say assholes morning. find second part applies all, potential reason why. reference linked previous comment one CDC seems trust insofar cited website. illustrate thinking behind CDC's decision. data used paper came China. CDC's reference sufficient illustrate thinking inside CDC point gamble taking decision. 

There are, course, papers dealing studied virus human history (it left HIV coughing dust months ago). Different researchers **will** come different numbers. believe seen 27 day number mentioned somewhere though outlier amongst papers published. 

Here, instance, early year mentions incubation periods gleaned number different methods. One numbers cited 24 days 95% confidence level (two standard deviations). everything biology statistical, acceptable work *always* mentions confidence level, chance wrong. 

The dust settled least somewhat past months accurate papers coming huge enterprise. said almost automatically cases found incubate disease longer 14 days (even accounting possibility may represent second forgotten exposure remembered earlier exposure 'set clock'.

The point outliers hopefully uncommon enough affect CDC's calculations (guesses actually) hoped-for gain compliance lowering quarantine period. less relevant period 10 14 days is. Let's hope gamble pay off. live 20 minutes parents, husband going tomorrow. game time call, looked weather report realized going warm enough mid-afternoon Thanksgiving meal take deck. outside. prep anything happening inside, husband masked protect parents.

Edited add, restaurant since February, get together others, exclusively work home since March 1st, absolutely limit shopping trips consolidating hours, entire region nearly 100% mask compliant. zero risk, low risk. Knock wood.  That's good question probably answers, assume mal intent bat. would appreciate I'm getting downvotted one good looking cause death others.

Thanks though, I’ll continue attracted people brain conscious. I'm literally correct, already expressed argument. truly sorry triggered you, common thing see among students days. Despite taught, opinion equally valid everyone elses. you, friend. diseases, ""viral"" load talked *initial* viral load. infected, virus reproducing rapidly every cell infects (damaging them). Internal replication much effective within lungs breathing new droplets. “Come back WFH, curbside pickup isolate...It sucks people work self isolate family case go parties”

Ok one finally said it. I’m sure realize this, telling people physically work day, cases demanding jobs like warehouse work retail cannot visit friends family cushy WFH job expect deliver food you, go apartment social contact friends family, physical intimacy, WFH job, incredibly touch. 

It’s also ignoring mental health, psychological needs treating people like robots, it’s also form classism, cases, rural/urban division. talking 2000-3000 daily deaths COVID? It’s rather total number deaths including reasons. traveling, meeting people outside household/bubble. People totally wear masks time take covidy risks. blame Trump Fox News. dad Democrat Trump married latest wife watches Fox News. norm going forward every flu cold season. feeling well? Put mask go public place. actual site [World Economic want? Last time checked bakery could fact deny people gay.

So yeah, private ownership means rules.

Freedom speech applies government, would know would actually read constitution. know conservatives don’t like that. Sad true. legally kick 18. Uh, link says fatal myocarditis extremely prevalent pandemic strain influenza mean, maybe they’re buying household? bought turkey day. 

It’s roommate, lol. wanted semblance normality.

I know I’m probably optimistic though, people gatherings. accounts people literally dying hospital insisting COVID hoax. 18 year olds havent able financially independent decade now. Make 25. goal flatten curve, eliminate virus. economy must saved costs apparently. goal flattening curve make sure hospitals overflow greatly increase death rate. 

It worked places would worked better people followed advice. 

We come full circle people refuse follow guidance. FFIX. CMV. much benefits working home, there's definitely going social impacts. Making friends adult hard enough is. Many people rely social interactions work. Although I'm sure tons people hate forced interactions like too. live northern Virginia. I've commented variety posts we've mask mandate since March 1st, 8 9 months since mandate went effect seen person place business without mask. whole area, regardless politics, really observant good pandemic protocol.

However, sitting day Thanksgiving, tell ton out-of-state plates local shopping center, shopping center absolutely jammed. Traffic roads jammed. Even though people observing good protocols presumably, we've got lot out-of-staters spreading s*** community.

We Thanksgiving dinner parents deck. going warm enough us that, that's reason getting together. get people get. think universally true. I'm pretty sure local CVS sign says ""Free (with insurance plans)."" Unless find article pay for, I'll defer ones freely call bs going Thanksgiving family COVID damned. gonna take temps going Thanksgiving time family, family be, together, like year. hardly “white man’s disease.” I’ve driven Colorado Texas. doesn’t take long, hired driver bring vice versa.

Hasn’t positive twice now? need so, bring cheese ! surprised recommend booster Fall 2021 along initial shot spring. course fine since probably (hopefully) getting flu shot anyway. think helps put words disagree statement. course damaging, scale, depth, impact different. Thank comment!  follow requirements driving help keep people stay safe, can't wear piece cloth? EXCLUDING data attempting analyze arms followed original protocol. pulling phase 2 data also followed protocol attempt gain subjects.

If decisions made data seen, would one thing. decisions made fly appears questionable.

Realistically, standpoint. think inclusion phase 2 data problematic. IMO NEVER included. know data shows good result treatment group... otherwise would stopped phase three would never happen.  Make sure see all, might last time see them. spouse drove like idiot, I’d probably stick around long either.

Amazingly enough, don’t want spend time people don’t care people’s lives. learned anything now? exactly, proof negative test? suppose lab report. would test conducted within certain window entering? validate authenticity? ridiculous.

Show COVID addressed inappropriately doll Yeah hear ya, pedophile cult leader really talk? Fair, keep mind several things:
- one vaccine link created 7 cases
- one version vaccine. H1N1 vaccines issues
- many, many vaccines given zero issues
- vaccine one H1N1 vaccine, RNA based (the H1N1 one inactive)

Thus, chance happening almost zero.

Please evaluate risk avoiding vaccinations due potential risk almost chance even get serious side effect, risk getting diseases thousands times risky.


It like 6th Grade teacher refused wear seatbelt car, may cut car accident. Yes, possible. However, false negatives common false positives. Odds test negative. tests emergency use authorization FDA COVID still variability results unfortunately. Poor cops still handle close. give cops 5' animal control catch poles hook idiots neck safe distance, toss back animal control van.  us understand exponential growth

most people understand exponential growth, that's issue. surprise anyone understands. seems plausible explanation. author's assumption seems Oxford/Astra may hiding something providing results single large-scale study revealing details pertaining studies. 

It could well case yet enough data single study reveal information regulatory authorities regarding studies submissions. doubt would jeopardize integrity industry vaccine sold at-cost cherry picking data, mention difficulty achieving approval appeared cherry picking. 

I suspect enough information studies statistically conclude vaccine simply safe 50% effective. method reaching conclusion may unconventional, virus intended address. Rubio. Interesting. obviously vaccine therapy already sick hospitalized. worked unit first wave, point agree you, lives hands. spiritual way, nothing helped. Incredibly frustrating.

My thought could target vaccine communities virus spreading, perhaps combination lockdown, could prevent people getting sick all. Relying people catch virus gain immunity risky. Areas virus rampant, even exist, would comparatively gain less benefit vaccinated immediately. I'm wondering point anyone actually correct things protect others continue family gatherings cause another percentage people falter. One would think 9 months people still holding fort strong continue sure. know 6 months saw friends even careful us go deep end wineries holding 17 people person events. magic number where, after, everyone gave would? Ok, assumed intentions meaning wrote, context actually wrote, based consider unorthodox usage ellipses, get it. eat up. Higher case loads=greater devotion, according 2020 electoral results. live dense county CA (2 million people) we’re locked down. Go 100 miles north south though, they’re not

It’s areas didn’t take shit seriously fucked, places locked down. people don’t realize fucking conservative parts CA are.  Propaganda misinformation easily spread internet. Earth put hard stop without trampling first amendment? Rules thee sad. 2-3 weeks, numbers going even higher. Yes, United States initially committed invading Japan preparing carry out. *However,* experience elsewhere Pacific (particularly Okinawa) led growing number top military leaders reevaluating invasion calling another option months Japan's surrender. What's status indoor dining there? active? Restaurants bars like accelerator pedal. There's week-long delay case rate drops, like car coasting slower speed.

It's good thing vaccine coming; like brakes. really hope us playing safe long now. father-in-law worked Ford 20 years recently retired. vouch, healthcare plan still fantastic. Ford treats employees well. That's ones ashamed say so. like half. can’t figure got elected. patently false. I’m sure it’s damaging Trump’s behavior came earlier, still better opportunity control disaster.

But time we’re thinking carefully whether someone’s COVID-related behavior just-as-bad-as not-quite-as-bad-as Trump’s, they’ve fucked up.   Nobody angry saying so. No, definitely mdma.  fella ^ said it’s do-able I’m sure obviously don’t either - study differentiate indoor outdoor dining. snide, arrogant comment ridiculous.

Ricardo .Samaniego, El Paso County Judge

Read El Paso Orders 12 15: (just change 2 3 4 5)

This County Judge already wrote baseline order October, orders that. Abott instantly went order, removed website even 24hrs later.

Now, basically order orders, ""strongly urges"", ""highly recommends"" ""shall"". one point order even flat says "" Governor Abbott mandated "".

&amp;#x200B;

edit: least Judge could sneak this: "" WHEREAS, El Paso County’s positive COVID-19 cases worse today first Stay Home Order issued; "" Thank Ravens, guess. elderly? grandmother take 4000 might harmfu Tell dad prevent even deadly car crashes huge amount rules/regulation, seat belts, speed limits, traffic lights, etc. Wearing mask like wearing seat belt. wonder lost war ^

A reddit moment CDC expects vaccinate 20 million ppl end 2021 LOL

Wait two weeks. Well dad liar. 2018 3,305 TOTAL entire year: 6,000 deadly crashes SINGLE day, would need major transit investigation 3,305 already number 1 entire goddamn country.

Also good Hep C top infectious killer Covid-19 (just 20K deaths 2014), think 1 5 know treated. think recommendation anyone born 1976, high risk (needle sharing) life style get tested. honestly, let's compare flu. healthy person may (not certainly) able recover quickly, flu dangerous causes many deaths, well side effects like organ damage people. taken seriously, people able strongly encouraged take flu shot every year. people sick flu try stay home wear mask can't, person transmit might survive even big deal sick person. individual taking measures prevent spread flu save lives, could government guaranteeing paid sick days allow people stay home. 

occasionally particular deadly strains show one worse side effects (like swine flu) taken seriously. coronavirus goes beyond like mega flu 10 times deadly, highly infectious, causes organ damage relatively commonly. already taking flu much seriously people do, covid-19 like 10 bad that, covid-19 justifies measures disrupt lives. thought allergies

Allergies November? Suuuure following guidelines. think white house would things worry about.

Well, look who's still it. Hopefully things change January we've screwed partying holidays. train death rate 342/day another train death rate 593/day heading opposite direction, many dead people would left behind station station Poland? Another article case explained think virus likely made way gathering one family member whose job required work outside home, Aragonez said. family member attended event symptoms thought allergies. maybe don’t understand - people deserve concrete evidence actually looks specific risk dining outdoors. someone dining outdoors member family - specific risk? risk dining someone outside household obviously higher - dining outside isn’t necessarily shown cause spread. People congregate home instead restaurant sitting outside. 

A larger source spread la government buildings lol. seems arbitrary, capricious cruel local business. Number 3 world right now. 2002 2020. 3rd world again. 🙏 say ""real"" mean something majority people encounter life somewhat regularly. Plumbing skills useful exponentials people. understand good science would love educated population, exponents seem like high hanging fruit compared lot basic education people lack. Americans treat 9/11 much like Japanese treat atomic bombings. Thanks. understand write way conditionals headlines starting drive crazy. Even idiots think everything fine ""mights"" ""coulds"". 9/11 happened democrat state, think that! ""Moderna come different formulation lipid nanoparticles protect mRNA vaccine. formulations corporate secrets, Moderna thinks approach better said vaccine shipped minus 20 degrees C (minus 4 degrees F) kept stable 30 days 2 degrees 8 degrees C (36 46F), temperature standard home refrigerator.""

&amp;#x200B;

I wished would tink global human focused instead business focused.

They could share knowledge mRNA protection Biontech vaccine also could delivered easily...and people could vaccinated. Think gotta look 62% efficacy number half dose regimen fleshed out.

Shame vaccine isn’t effective, still help big time. Yes! Thank you.  Everytime get hopes goes shit again. keep pessimistic view :D Huh, could’ve sworn symptoms last time read false positive. Yeah I'm aware they've successful issues arise first 2 months that. fact matter long term data I'm leaning towards traditional vaccines Haha okay, whatever say.  That's plan well worry could mutate even worse 2020 ugh. No, change some. Retail reduced 25% capacity outdoor dining banned (10-15% cases linked restaurants). save us, help mitigate some, even important we're surge people stupid holidays. Please stop dick. abortion hurt anyone. I'm still boat honestly. like that, generation high school students decided go medicine. Agreed, even seen unrest world might correlation lock fatigue.  doubting correctly

EDIT 300million, like billions, USA aint country pushing vaccine onto populace Yes, hope someday. hell else would from? think meant type /r/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM. also takes long time statistically significant number vaccine trial volunteers exposed pandemic situation. government planet allowed restrict rights invade personal choices like cause action? Lol Thanks reply.

The H1N1 vaccine caused people develop narcolepsy two years taking it. 

Based think reasonable people want take vaccine immediately. people work family members coming states holidays, acting like completely normal year. family husband close mom even celebrating year. three us seem fine husband tested month ago negative, mean asymptomatic. I'd rather skip one thanksgiving one us sick dead Christmas. likely temporary measure pandemic subsided. post-Thanksgiving wave going painful. CDC's promise 20 million people vaccinated end 2021 gonna end pandemic USA, currently infecting 1 million **per week** *accelerating*. I'd shocked that. late. vaccine start preventing infection January wave Thanksgiving kill people Christmas.  Again, thanks. I’m almost getting hopes reaching plateau cases. Well stay small towns right? lot movement infect one community next easily. say, do. Today learned. it’s paraphrasing. tiers border shutdowns. crude language trying substitute non-existent argument. best game day gets postponed. hospitalisations, roof sign slowing. Thanks. That’s bad. Right! COVID widely accepted airplane air circulation conducive spreading flu-like respiratory illnesses. However, reason, industry CDC feels important tell us airplane air safe aerosol borne pandemic. Interesting. TIL country world shut borders, new phrasing term apparently. 30 minutes flight, Hancock's account tweeted “avoid travel, can”

But cannot! That's always problematic statement make. guess might true state/regional level example Novo Mesto municipality Southeastern Slovenia recorded 35 deaths per 100k inhabitants last seven days certainly higher. I'm sorry still disagree. either case occurring. living toned-down version years.  
 
I glad critical powers be. think bit misguided terms whole conspiracy side it, criticism/skepticism good. swear redditors scream 'sue him!!' every fucking thing. long-term tests around vaccine developed type vaccine typically interacts body. cases associate risks around live vaccines, cases people think inactive ones. ones get variation RNA one (I really simplifying it, many different variations) shown safe.

Unfortunately, vaccines typically never studied 50 75 years, none rule long-term effective 100%.

What say rushing vaccine done risk safety financially producing it. Typically takes years naturalize virus, know acts learn treat (we knew early on). takes years animal testing, determine whether works whether financially move onto next stage. works, company invest phase 1, 2 3. However, want spend money advancing work.

One thing able accomplish time around identified many participants right away, many willing so. Think HIV vaccine; Would want participate placebo group? also live active virus, easy put people test environment see worked better placebo.

But number people surpassed typically see vaccine trial monitoring individuals rushed. kids, except room separate entrance outside breaks staggered classes intermingle. 

Even so, pulling first two weeks January trust families act responsibly holidays. I'm guessing schools open January anyway already getting telegraphed us provincial leaders. Saying handled already stretch. guy anything worth mentioning. played golf watched TV anything. Poland 38m people deaths around 400-600/day past two weeks USA around 1500-2000/day 320m population. multiply 38 8.4 gives population 319m deaths 3360-5000 deaths per day. 4x death rate still least 2x worse USA currently polish government completely stopped caring enough tests put proper lockdown. title thread misleading work district gone fully virtual. fairly large District (23k students). role school I'm never within six feet anybody. I've noticed teachers able distance mask-wearing taken seriously.

My children go smaller rural Public School. person 5 days week since day Labor Day. Locals town live marginal best comes mask-wearing public. 


My oldest daughter's entire grade got sent home quarantine two cases class. district waited 5 days tell us exposure took place. automatically assumed younger sister quarantined well. Upon first absence informed unexcused, accrues five, truancy officer called.

Two different schools, handling two completely different ways. One school's leadership right thing, opinion, not. sign lack leadership top. someone post article archive link please? Paywall.... Yeah, say 3-10. Poland likely least middle range undertest heavily. many brain cells take make intelligent decision? Pandemic, sick, hospital bills party on? fair share 43% probably would still think government fine making eat dirt ""patriotism"" though. Partisan politics + propaganda dangerous combo. Note self. Never visit Poland. joke.... Thanks info! remember April reddit phds told everyone Sweden would emerge winner end year

To fair, also remember experts said would 85,000 deaths Sweden. Wtf capitalism giant huge fucking opportunity cost simply ceasing travel stranding loads people supporting people instead stopping small set flights to/from one country therefore support 360 million people instead Saving face exclusively Chinese, common across Asian countries/cultural lol No. Youd poorly managed states favor. covid manage damage different organs? get damaged low oxygen levels? try telling like common cold? cousin knows someone got real bad everybody else got said fine 
She left hospital virus still acting like it’s blown proportion even argument fails well hate country.

One regiment 90% effective 65% effective. obviously done peer reviewed probably going pick dosing regiment higher efficiency rating. You’d think country 1/5 people died nazis would nazis... think vaccine part conspiracy theory, either make people ill track lockdowns used measure force compliance future vaccination regime. main reasons this:

1. internet exploded conspiracy theories, unusual, since many people staying home due work suspended, likely spend time internet engage theories become increasingly paranoid like-minded users participate echo chamber promote increasingly radical interpretations what's allegedly happening.

2. Cognitive overload. beginning pandemic, fewer people's jobs bottom lines impacted spent months isolated friends worried safety family. time wore on, concerns mounted, constant presence began take toll people's mental health person directs thinking anxiety-inducing subjects, less brain power left assess situation rational spotlight making people prone cognitive errors.

3. Conditioning. People gotten used mass dying result virus, result mew statistics powerful anymore. Remember back March people shocked hear bodies stored 18-wheelers NY morgues full? Well now, I've heard news reports thing occurring parts country, like El Paso, become normalized front page news anymore. * done nothing teleport children three days. * 70%? I've yet see single person QC wear mask enclosed public place. Still, lot cases-shmases, everything locked masks really help much. masks truly worked, would reason shut businesses down. Moderna one stored normal freezers (like temps freezer makes home), ultra cold freezers. problem clinics, pharmacies. I'm us pediatrician virtual visits. took son urgent care bc got sent home school sinus problems. urgent care even see us. wait next day get person appt. ended chest congestion. can't hear computer. he's 4 starting really talk. livid w urgent care. ended missing week school bad allergies nothing persuades non-believers afraid Oh know? long contributing economy, safe COVID.

Just ignore overflowing hospitals exponential growth. wave restrictions early year government massively overshoot

Not quibble, reason people think governments overshot spring worked. really bad people understand that. gold! know several awful time! (me included) certain american deaths tragedies aswell like 9/11 certainly 260K+ Covid said absolutely nothing substantial response crux comment Look, know vitamin important human quality health. reason white skinned people got light colored skin ancient black skinned ancestors. 

Vitamin important bundled clothing due migration cold regions, lighter skinned members group survived better reproductive age would absorb ultra violet light easier/quicker darker skinned kin - giving healthier vitamin levels. Redo scenario bunch generations skin color group paled.

So, low vitamin bad. matter causes worse covid not. certainly doesn’t hurt get one’s self healthy levels either sun skin time supplements. Denmarks amazing capacity tests already start pandemic, probably helped enormous amount.

If Sweden also laying around! 700+ posts main thread yesterday. post could apply slightly maybe 1 2 really stretch. They're simply making something exist start circle jerk attack restrictions.  would say allowing people walk around disease vectors unethical. school district employee, immunocompromised person, really feel right now. Indeed. must keep vaccination going totally gone, otherwise come back. globally eradicated viruses stop vaccination. US dog eat dog. Neighbors care little eachother long people cover themselves. routinely go six feet under. *It's longer think*, *Dad*! Longer think! realize pandemic, right? rights end put everyone around risk crippling illness death. fear, survival. era humanity would get kicked city put jail refusing comply safety matters. might like COVID real way worse outcome ""within decimal point"" Exemptions work places like nursing homes, healthcare facilities, etc. failure vaccinate could result mass loss life. rest, employer could come ""accomodations"" like requiring vaccine refusers wear PPEs engage extra hygiene practices.  lot ""reasonable accomodations"" employer could implement seen punitive courts. Really, employer wanted mandatory vaccination, could make difficult get exemption worth 99.9% employees seeking them. mhm... still expecting 37-42 range. Woke-adjacent. head Catholic Church isn’t bad. ?????

That article nearly 2 weeks ago. Fauci changes mind time, constantly-shifting situation. Lately he's saying spring 2021.

Also, even say 2022 article. fucking kidding me? need hit control F type ""2022,"" blsee little citation prove point. Thanks, appreciate it. happened 90's still occasionally think it. Everything transpired past 9 months, double next 2..thats insane think about. EXACTLY FAKE CURE? Fortunately Oxford-Astra Zeneca collab vaccine might need .... they're 266000 States - high percentage think Trump handled thing fine. 

Spoiler: didn’t. first time I’m
Hearing this? read covid news hourly &amp; family Polish. alarming &amp; getting media coverage states Easier kids elderly parents/grandparents care for.

If position so, awesome. logic might apply youre islamist nutcase cares getting muslims radicalize. look Afghan perspective, lost everything gained nothing it.  Yes understand 70% great, compare 95%, sounds terrible.

Like that's difference getting course getting C- course. Oklahoma isn’t South! (Although local state governments dumb). H1N1 handled horribly Go ahead site source. think Fauci CDC lying lots evidence existed? study done April made change mind? so, cite source. 

No, happened correlation China getting virus control wear masks. course tons non-medical interventions time, means nothing. public saw Asia controlled see wear masks, suddenly became gospel masks general public effective. 

As said, cite source. Vaccines give perfect protection, people can't take vaccines. One person Pfizer vaccinated group got severe Covid. think political party, left right, handle situation better people feeling strongly end spectrum laughable best. answer total shutdown world answer exercise precautions. equilibrium point compromise people either dense views dumb actually get handle situation. Polish word would ""teleporada"" translates ""telephone consultation"".

The computer program probably know word thought ""teleportada"" teleportation Spanish. mean countries almost completely back normal summer, vaccines expected widely available March/April.

And Olympics arent actually late summer(July 23- August 8) realize 70% still incredible?? never vaccine developed Coronavirus. need research vaccines, yearly flu vaccine sometimes 50% effective. Real shows understand problem. facts datapoints understand. side often goes denial outright fantasy or, case, pulls random context facts try bolster argument refuse flesh out. course many people hospitals conditions unrelated covid, almost certainly majority since we're talking EVERY reason people might hospital. many people tried hammer thick skull severe covid patients add enormous staffing resource burden hospitals simply met beds (otherwise could stuff hotel housekeeping check day, genius). Honestly, can't bothered explain people like typically regress back denial fantasy versions argument move onto irrelevant ""datapoint."" Peer pressure 2020 weird. Sorry deal actually pharma company behind vaccine, like, sure You’re forgetting another group know it’s serious still selfish enough engage routinely small social gatherings, outside dining drinking “masked” travel. Extroverts literally don’t discipline mental fortitude sit long driving cases. You’re right way turn around sadly it’s matter people realizing it’s seriousness affects personally. Come Christmas good chunk people affected personally going national crisis multiple times worse years end due what’s happening week. Umm talking about. personally restrictions keep things exploding.

Masks good social distancing like end spring I'm there. set bullshit there. antimasker? simple answer Sweden develop degree herd immunity summer, that's spread slowed August September. like respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2 seasonal--so come winter R0 increased, herd immunity threshold, virus resumed fast spread.

By analogy, group people might herd immunity influenza normal daily lives, vaccination previous illness. pack cruise ship, maybe don't, that's outbreaks happen cruises. R0 herd immunity threshold functions environment human behavior, disease.

Vaccination campaigns provide robust herd immunity making conservative (high) estimate threshold, vaccinating yet people margin.

I know saying, understand it, can't draw parallel covid cancer, I'm mad people living lives. I'm saying need shelter place never go outside. I'm talking people actively trying spread disease. management say something want.

And care life they're scared dumb people guns. people allowed carry gun everywhere go reason. shitstorm US hides suffering behind HIPAA rules one outside medical personnel gets see what's happening. privacy rules must, lack images video happens also feeds conspiracy nuts saying 'see?

Unless already deathbed, virus extremely small chance killing you. Let vulnerable quarantine let healthy continue live normal life. It’s hard concept grasp. Isn’t someone else’s virus hole business?

I don’t like comment I’m going shoot you. didn’t comment, wouldn’t get shot.  Sometimes better focus positive instead pointing negatives Singaporean here. prefer don’t let guard let go 28 consecutive days 2 incubation periods.

Schools go far beyond claim. lots people blame correct. sure downvotes, literary first wave going crazy completely control. 

there steady stream infections 50-300 day many month change, schools opened everyone came back summer vacation jumped abysmal numbers creating first massive wave. Remember back April came said next week(?) would ""Our Pearl Harbor"", whatever meant...well WW1 trench war, cause slowing down, anything 2000 daily deaths look good happens next 3 months.


We collectively dropping ball right finish line too, like 100,000 people die still can't wear mask, simply MUST gather holidays...by time xmas think it'll bad people come BIT senses. Right?

Everywhere I've seeing plan make free, eliminate pretty much barrier would taking it. main issue i’m whole situation right now... don’t see ANYTHING news Poland going bonkers... hoping good article get focus issue everyone media inside country broadly ignores crazy stuff that’s going here. Never put kid in. life valuable job me. believe per capita smaller country US. total numbers. 

If US seeing percentages would bloodbath. hope never gets high hope something done help Poland's cases.

It’s amazing even lose sense taste feel bad, similar numbers US. :( Death rate velocity death total position. make sense calculus ;) Pushing back mandated COVID vaccines seems like fighting ocean

No know problem vaccinations.

It kind funny conspiracy nuts going ""forced vaccinations"" deal them. also tired hearing family members say ‘Isn’t anything else do?’ us say ‘no.’”

Wonder many family members anti-mask? anti-social distance? 

I also wonder many types ""no"" heard gluttonous social behavior many Thanksgiving? Thanksgiving consist Chinese takeout feast two. that's Thanksgiving. Dont become lethal. Thats worry more. Red tape cut safety testing measures cut. Avoid people living home less meaningful number. Avoid gathering 5+ people would say more.

It became bad one time, testing restricted health care workers. Luckily Health Minister, Magnus Heuniche, intervened took action became publicly known private offers ignored others rejected various Danish authorities. political decision expand testing Sweden. highlights. Brits superfluous Us... Right? Like get it, America sucks whole history littered piles atrocities.

But stopping two empires plans militarized world domination, together killed 25,000,00 civilians, one moral failings. EU'S! went state school lived campus. like kick holidays. least went school, could stay campus breaks.

They see people die think everything worthless. whole family thinks liberal buying media skipping Thanksgiving. planning typical huge dinner cancelled plans go eat. mid-twenties regular ""parental people pleaser"" figured global pandemic better time stand ground.  good news seems doctors might over-diagnosing hart damage Covid.

""Speaking [the US Congress Dr. Anthony Fauci National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases said estimated overall death somewhere around 1%. inclusive virus, including tested.  

This would make Covid-19 ten times lethal seasonal flu, fatality rate 0.1%. way another comparison, 2009 swine flu pandemic estimated fatal around 0.02% cases. 

A study Imperial College London, based 70,000 cases China, put death rate confirmed [cases Covid-19 1.38%](http://www.news.msn.ie/covid-19-coronavirus-death-rate-5062190-Mar2020/). article, researchers estimated overall death rate, including unconfirmed cases, 0.66%. 

Again though, estimation don’t sufficient knowledge spread virus yet sure.""

You know bad is. Neither guy. could turn almost everyone already exposed. agree laws society live one. pretty irrelevant visitors unless look gay Islamic. I've going regularly Poland years issues. Main difference compared Germany Poland far fewer anti-social elements roaming streets, I've seen virtually vandalism. anything? studies CDC, coronavirus continue shed recovered person 3 months illness onset, new U.K. study determined live virus found patients much shorter time period.

This part blows away.

Doesnt mean asymptomatic Covid, test positive whole 3 months, small fraction period whre actually infectious beginning?

Doesnt mean lot people maybe testing positive *after* already finished Covid? Supreme Court previously ruled forced vaccinations constitutional. I’m making statement whether agree not, precedent. failure

🤔 Exactly. recently late October, Florida people died May popping daily death reports. Granted, governor's strategy seems downplay anything bad, death reporting could slowed inorganically. basically rushed? every person caught gets hospitalized then? isn’t Turkey problem sure. Leadership world needs mature realize shame honest citizens humanity trouble problems. ask share ideas others around world.

Most nations’ leadership culture seems suffer arrogance - trying hide bad news always want look strong perfect. much human suffering arrogant attitude centuries millennia?

From US I’m sorry mom sick difficult situation. I’m glad got better! extended family struggling get proper non-covid health care hospitals busy covid patients. unsettling. site get hug death? load  care people really believe vaccine 100% safe? It’s like group project back college, you’re one putting whole damn thing together working everyone else contributes nothing, you’ve got work everyone gets grade don’t want fail. got cat covid pretty good idea ... thing keeping sane sometimes lol Global Warming take care Florida soon enough Military top brass, sure. Troops won't. shitty young, easier lockdown base, would enough troops shootout.

Medical personnel much higher risk loosing option cases explode. Build case.

This reddit. 

Stop unreasonable. Good luck. admire strength. yes microchips like aliens? 

Okay. Cool.

Because humans pretty much disease vectors. Damn, science common sense see coming. March: ""2 weeks stop spread!""



November: "" oh god people selfish cancelling Thanksgiving. WTF""


November 2021: "" arent people still social distancing, everyone vacinated!!"" conspiracy theories - really happened. Evidence still much there. google around.

And lost me....

Can’t wait see face 7 days new Covid cases. People need stay home sick. There's lot people even that. agree, even well balanced people bring fears growing third eye due mRNA. tried come benign analogy tell eating meat also process involves putting foreign DNA body results body producing certain compounds, e.g. insulin.

I know scientific slight hand, works. open better analogies. jesus smell piss bottle get wrong, vaccine available me; would take heartbeat. passed safety protocol, really needed. even 50% effective; way better nothing.

The issue including phase two priori threefold; first mentioned know phase three analysis phase least promising. Second, usually phase two several dosage options evaluated choose promising phase three. results de facto cherry picking. Finally, grouping phase two phase three data introducing confounding variable (time) many elements likely different across variable. case would assume rate community transmission number exposures virus varied time phase two trials time phase three trials.

Once again, I'd still take heartbeat consider lucky. comments academic design experiments critique, reason avoid vaccine. gotta go point, 55 really fucking early modern society. people, that's decade left career. 65 also insanely ancient age either.

Also, say somebody going die 70 causes dies 65 due COVID. That's 5 years getting actually use retirement saved working life, (for many them) 5 years getting watch grandkids grow up. im talking intensity, yes right Anyone else get huge guilt trip family cancelled? original post said “exponential” “exponential function” exciting come home thanksgiving. Stay well! COVID thee. :P Right, proving wrong.

The ""7 cases"" part study done vaccine Quebec only.

Why trying pretend 7 globally?!

Perhaps try talk authoritative tone know read research. know nurse doctor still think virus fake. OP /u/SiggyStardustMonday know they're talking about. 

In 2010, Cleveland Clinic best performing Ohio hospital $530 million profit. Certainly could changed 10 years there's way hospital Ohio 2020 $3.9 billion (**that's billion B**) *quarterly* occasional visitor probably bothered. live move here, reaction season slowly get worse time. **Summary preliminary findings far** (I one 242 positive tests here!):

Virus Watch began recruiting people July 2020 22nd November, 20,920 households 43,073 people across England Wales joined study.

The levels people reporting cough, fever loss change sense smell and/or taste highest week commencing 21st September 2020, highest level symptoms reported children young adults aged 0 17 years. 

The levels people reporting cough fever Virus Watch lower July, August, October November 2020 compared prior studies infections conducted 2018 2019. 

242 people age 16 Virus Watch reported positive COVID-19 test. these, 40% close contact people outside household 7 days prior test. 

In period likely contagious (two days onset symptoms illness survey date), 67% participants age 16 positive COVID-19 test reported non-household contacts spent 15+ minutes within 2 metre distance. 33% reported contact people.

Of 242 positive COVID-19 cases, 17% occurred one-person household 83% multi-person households. 149 multi-person households least one case reported, 70% reported single case, 30% reported multiple cases.  Yea, get it. honestly even notice. gone store since March. really easy live everything delivered house times I've curbside pickup, leave mask car they're putting stuff trunk keep store staff safe...and mask walks good amount people trails (I also veer far away mask on). I'll huffing steep incline hill even notice mask face. swear people love cause conflict completely selfish reason. Also type people answer polls are, shall say, exactly representative Sure, know lung gets destroyed, heart stop, kidneys usually damaged, blood barrier brain becomes leaky, cells sustain nerve cells die, harm could possibly come that? turkey die even vaccine people can’t go back normal? worse. might hate Trump upfront it. lifetime politicians extremely two-faced. month later...

Google maps says 15 hours, one day kind pushing unless enjoy long drives kind thing FU airlines. everyone maniac like am, LOL. know what's ironic could flown private perhaps avoided controversy. everyone quarantined month went directly party would, fact, impossible get sick.

Of course not. multiple examples national media academic papers people getting sick isolated, including brother. assumed got sick delivery groceries, he's immunocompromised literally lives alone 500 acres seen single person since march, somehow got sick. absolutely wrong here. are. sound like teenager makes wonder 04 user name fact birthyear Really appreciate it! Good, let’s keep way. said little dishonest said 7 cases, entirely untrue.

Now completely unreasonable.

Why everyone reddit turn fucking crazy?! I’m sorry.. sucks. Well, reason 30% going listen CDC bunch politicians can't even follow advice. Let's virus rip guess, politicians going get best care rest screw. respect chairs task force … Pence ? may minor glimmer hope that. Long run, would better businesses put profits ahead health employees liable, even means short term financial issues.

They're holding country financially hostage, barbaric. extremely concerning. I’ve eye thanksgiving year really hope fall isn’t bad I’ve bracing for.

While I’m going miss giant family thanksgiving year (usually house 30-40 people ages) I’m looking forward experiencing Thanksgiving simpler way year husband I:

1. Make favorite dishes nothing else
2. Zoom call fam dinner - can’t imagine go smoothly technically speaking lol
3. Relax adult beverage enjoying [thanksgiving worth risk life family members’ lives one day. 2010 article. generalization. clearly made generalization. I’m back college neither friends done anything sit home. Cheers. Great work. Yes! Mitch Hedburg. still love joke. ""I used drugs. still do, used also. Amen Rochester, NY there's sorts stupidity happening try keep schools open. Technically district rapid test 20% faculty, staff, students, opt in. problem people opt likely going ones testing positive, following rules along. Monroe county also trying incorporate testing stats artificially deflate average. 

Cuomo allegedly plan place keep k-8 person, touts low infection rates schools, teachers getting sick. There's enormous amount insistence teachers contract Covid classroom. certain point, that's going matter there's nobody left teach kids. Thanks checking out! Dr. serendipity rides again. reminiscent discovery penicillin. sometimes happens hear hoof beats really zebras horses. De-authorize plastic payment cards people might settle bit.

I idea get thru people's heads, care greater good. generalize “all”?
And know wtf get hometowns. Sending love. father suffered hepatic encephalopathy almost full year died. last time saw weeks finally passed away single painful day life. seen couple months (live state) decline time hit like ton bricks. rapid weight loss loss muscle mass (he firefighter) combined hard time recognizing crushed - walk away 'get bags' could gather myself.

The morning mother called (before 5 know phone ringing for) process it. made sure okay hung up, sighed, rolled best 2 hours sleep months. woke feeling guilty hell that. relief strongest emotion while, guilt close second. took process - weeks cried again. realized lost weeks prior unable begin grieving, body dying seemed like formality point. dad died died, least far concerned, recognized that. strong, self sufficient person always was. weakness memory loss, clear moments pain eyes. never wanted burden anyone, especially wife 40+ years.

So hate thinking better alternative. likely could be. know better child. Feel feelings, ever angry feeling see point go back office people failed build maintain personal relationships get social kicks flip out. 

Work work, colleagues aren’t friends. rich family social life there’s nothing hate ‘encouraged’ go work social events people empty lives feel normal bit. Harsh true. much hate masks that’s actually one thing don’t mind them. mandatory means even forget scarf something keep face relatively warm mask thank you...how know they're genuine? issue counterfeit kn95s effective? I’m fighting you. letting know writing unclear makes come unnecessarily aggressive using ellipses incorrectly things dont seem want do. keep prolonging this. Take leave it. see. right, that's false. takes one person realize got infected travel...or seeing friend...or going store. masks work long term closed space lot people...who also taking masks eat.
Have watching dozens families news who've infected got half relatives sick (and sometimes killed them)? Gotta love auto correct browsers! Thank you! clue, pointing can’t reasonably generalize college students like vilify coming home. Walgreens cvs near you? look - it’s cost free That’s great point - thank you! ""African European?"" freezers long service lives cost 10-15k piece. Ford donate somewhere like UMich take tax write off. Next level: keep money fake gun tucked waistband. big good chunk compare schools outta states zzzzz   long day hospital, great seeing people gathering wearing masks way home.

The general population taking seriously makes much exhausting. Yeah. could link, often might be. need downvote dude. It’s small liberal arts school. I’m pointing good chunk students go types schools, go home. I’m making turkey, favorite sides. kids make hand turkeys made little placemats dinner tomorrow. It’s youngest’s first thanksgiving bummed isn’t like “normal”, especially since extended family even met yet! But, good time little family make traditions share extended family next year, hopefully. Husband watching Crown kids go sleep. Well vote click baity title... wont since pulled out. However, still dont think worth upvote, ill mosey along.

Edit: could useless comment time... really breakdown deaths South Dakota, North Dakota small Midwest states compare ""U.S."" too. Back March seen temporary. second link answer: safe airline industry would believe, lot safer might think. 

I’m directly quoting article. 35 percent Texas classified obese, I'm sure y'all could see way pandemic without eating burning surplus fat store morons still vote next election. Wow, didn’t know 13 million (myself included) Americans caught Covid experienced this! big school, let’s see, compare public school. saying governor/mayor flaunting rules president really encouraging rules begin with. 

I know sub political thats far I'll take it.

I 100% understand damaging dangerous action taken. However equal opinion.  Remind me! 6 months people college virtually? We've virtual since started FL... honestly stay option, prefer virtual much want judgy things like this... always sniffle sneeze, year round I’m prescribed allergy medication. Every time cough sneeze attribute that. super mild COVID I’m sure wouldn’t able tell wasn’t normal symptoms. I’m going gatherings. discussion thread highlights interesting difference discourse Canada vs US. I’m BC we’ve told (and observed) thing - masks don’t anything stop spread private gatherings, much spread occurs. way reduce numbers wear masks public also minimizing contacts, especially private. I’ve found much discourse US masks masks alone. It’s interesting. Anyways, good luck QC. guys rough year. one unnecessarily joyless takes life I've ever seen. America third world country Gucci belt. AZ figure vaccine? Don’t worry resturant def doesn’t 700+ reservations thanksgiving.... there’s pandemic going on... stay home dumb people. 

Stay safe protect much can. want optimistic assume deaths hospitalizations peak next days given trends cases but, know, Thanksgiving all. 

Hopefully least reprieve first responders this. average, cabin air completely refreshed 20 times per hour, compared 12 times per hour office building.

 That's typical airline propaganda. key phrase ""on average."" ground usually case, pilot intentionally switch ground powered ventilation. Also airflow airplanes work way office spaces. regularly smell office bathroom cubicle? Probably not, that's air return vents redirect stale air away building occupants significantly separated conditioned air registers. airplanes circulation occupants always path inbound outbound circulation streams, everything carts, people moving around create far, far opportunities turbulent mixing inbound outbound airstreams. Ehh, maybe be, 'i heard many people it, figured f*** it.' Wouldn’t nice blissfully ignorant.

The older get, envy ignorance. Thanks good discussion. given good points sure challenged lot positions. wish sub kind discussion often. (It seems happen good data requires good discussion instead surface one though) instead usual BS. 

From “healthcare only” perspective, absolutely agree would make sense large number restrictions general population. also think would 2018. 

My point view always needs considerations, think take account, disease specialists healthcare providers viewpoints forefront, concerns, like mental health, effects remote learning school age children, potential social unrest, bio ethics(see: mandatory NPI interventions shoved aside put back burner. video BBC suppression multidisciplinary science favor public health epidemiology: 

But yeah, think it’s good discussion appreciate discourse instead typical people thinking don’t research assume. 

Thank you. him. im suprised people ""popular"" power arent speaking masks social distancing (Celebs, Artist etc) Staying home. Netflix, booze, ham, pressure, family, stupid family fights. could okay permanently.  even saying vaccine's efficiency spread lean way, data testing asymptomatic spread would logistically challenging.

Already 1200 deaths today w/o TX, CA, MI, WI, TN reported plenty others reported keep tacking throughout day. odds hit 2500 today tomorrow? seen anyone disagree this. hold pur representatives responsible harms cause.  Aside irresponsible hypocritical, also gives unnecessary fuel lie hoax, least overblown. ""See?? mayor told us avoid *our* families dangerous, clearly knows that's *actually* true."" There's much misinformation going around, absolutely responsibility people leadership set consistent, positive example safe behavior. 

Just terrible, terrible decision making part. think people downplaying can't trust Putin's Russia

Stop american propaganda, looks silly can't trust Putin's Russi


 Given choice, I'll wait someone trustworthy. There's reason go Sputnik another option, factor me.

Lol, says guy US. again, special, zero credibility according you...many countries still roll it, understand already? media really strong influencing opinion? Agreed, put nightly news black bar eyes leave mouth exposed see gasping. get written releases patients families help warn others. one videos someone social media enough.

Carbon dioxide captured production ethanol, dropped off, part, fewer Americans driving buying gas. home scared.

This sentiment makes want punch people throat. world hurt regardless glad vaccine distributed shortly. Getting 20-40 million high risk Americans medical personnel vaccinated December good first step. Tack 13-15 million already contracted virus (and knows many asymptomatic unrecorded). We've got least 50 million + Americans either immune reasonably safe reinfection end December.

Unfortunately best probably 20% people immune already contracted virus. Hopefully increased restrictions begin slowing down. Meh. really care anymore. point thing change minds effects personal life.

Both fortunately unfortunately, way many people personally effected restrictions, masks, distancing, etc. lash ignore things know anyone actually gotten sick. honestly believe problem. dangerous symptom, unpleasant, people like pain discomfort.

What gift new administration 👏 Good thing it’s fucking winter 😂 problem DeSantis stuck, reality state constitution says supposed doing.

The Duties Executive Office Governor enumerated [here](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?mode=View%20Statutes&amp;SubMenu=1&amp;App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=balanced+budget&amp;URL=0200-0299/0216/Sections/0216.151.html). Many state finances. governor responsible steering ship state finances. Florida state income tax, must rely revenue streams, notably sales tax various taxes aimed tourists. Add *sin taxes* (tobacco alcohol).

The lockdown (Spring 2020) cratered tourism tax revenue, closing restaurants bars killed *alcohol drink* *prepared food* taxes. DeSantis hole state budget needs, wide enough drive truck thru. Since Florida Constitution requires balanced budget, left two choices … either open everything back (and hope gets tax revenue back up) leave everything closed (and shrink state budget, services). Read get flavor would do.

It enviable situation. balanced budget probably something fiscal conservatives thought *a good idea time*, pretty much one saw pandemic coming, modeled effects Florida economy. giving DeSantis pass, see situation dealing with. think choices stink, methods going cause harm.  9 7 homeboy Xenogears. Ultimately, going airlines require this.....

I impression least work via EAPs may be... exactly top-shelf skills. (Some may great therapists able build good relationships clients couple sessions, others necessary room schedule bunch one-off clients reason.) hope EAP Therapist #2 work you, write therapy forever don't. interesting discussion know whether therapist work you.)

You mentioned teach college students. I'm guessing pretty smart person. Depression way perpetuates itself. smart actually hurt regard clever brain come better-sounding BS depression lie with. (I, uh, heard friend.) value therapist includes able notice BS tactfully point it, way friend family member might able do.

Remember: kill yourself, money saved zero value.

I would encourage reconsider math quality life standpoint. Let's say give try sort works; process going therapy helps find something completely resolve depression makes 50% less miserable. willing spend couple weeks working exchange 50% less misery course next decade? sure would.

Whatever do, wish best luck. I'm willing sweeten deal bit offer celebrities interested country wants take spotlight! around disease vector

They're social stigma society used them. erase social stigma wearing getting comfortable wearing them. 

I'm honestly difficulty imagining social situation trying convey. describe social situation talking mask stops chatting someone up? I've literally conversations people would never spoken otherwise, mask. non-typical mask drew interest.

Please stop widely attaching conservative title idiots, beliefs stupid extremist certainly traditional conservative views. people strong combative views reddit kids high school picked first Glenn Beck book think one purpose earth argue everyone remotely appears ""left."" end day, misinformed conservatives like misinformed liberals, certainly represent majority group. rest us things worry need fill days arguing random people online.  I'm afraid guys, wait January. current administration appear able handle anything beyond blindly supporting reality tv show persona. 

Stay safe, keep distance people, wear mask, go unnecessarily. vaccine way, there's hope end this. correct IFR, use CFR 2 million new cases. Current CFR estimate 12,498,734 cases / 259,005 deaths = 2.1% (from CDC data) many cases resolved yet CFR may higher.

Also current hospital situation parts country overwhelmed. could lead increased mortality.

OP's numbers pass smell test too. \~2000 deaths reported yesterday. 20 days would get us 40,000 deaths. people? broad claims you. think referring politicians. experts.No, mean public health/infectious disease experts. follow anyone's rules. accept smarter subject. evaluate claims see consistent reality. act accordingly. called critical thinking. agree. absurd. Yea. pretty messed up. thing things good pay ridiculous want anything shake tree. job industry I'd making little half now. make point save like mad full swing. lot guys buy boats, RVs, build new houses start freaking month. shitshow. kids also go smaller rural school. One already spent time home grade quarantined. We've riding superintendent's ass year virtual option, budge. technology they're using constantly sick kids, they're intent powering like normal year - remote learning altered schedule unless mandated state. message received last week sounds like may finally approaching tipping point staff levels lack willing substitutes. Either way, we're keeping kids home next week post-Thanksgiving cases chance clear out. gonna say Big Brother watching, Automod works, lol Hahaha. We’re ideas, haven’t tried anything yet.

* SD Governor, probably opinion even guidance fucking silly. ""Avoid travel, can"". ""If can""??? EVERONE avoid traveling Thanksgiving. grand total 0.00 people United States required compelled law travel Thanksgiving. Even absolute extreme scenario like ancient grandparent 3 months left live whos last wish celebrate holidays family, travel. let's real, often type example gets brought up, practically one actually situation anything even remotely resembling that. 

Every single person country could choose stay home. But, like asshole, simply won't. Everyone CAN. almost everyone won't. fucking pathetic. mean point you... one those, fucked do, fucked dont situations yup. this. 

there's reason powerful employers agreed WFH adjustments would make life easier employees. WFH makes atomized disconnected workforce benefits them. Oh makes sad! Oh wait! opinion holds value whatsoever, nobody cares whether think left die! [Behold, brilliant AV setup made province's press Premier self-isolating home eating restaurant positive case. internet connection spotty, audio consistent video keeps freezing. Look bright side way things going South Dakota empty land tribes since Governor followers dumbasses. Oh man ray tracing cool. want 3080 bad. That’s fair, still cringey hear There’s also fact flu season mild places COVID mitigation including widespread mask use. ""Hold beer."" Kristi Noem, Governor South Dakota said that? Bloody hell. Huh. lot Greeks campus btw. 

And that’s 1/5* since ignored grad students became contagious. didnt make adaptation, stupidity seeing holiday season wouldnt punishing now

Mutations diceroll time become less hostile/deadly/contagious/vaccine-resistant/etc. dicerolls, chances nightmare diceroll happens. Extreme example would airborne equivalent ebola. That's astronomically unlikely happen, like winning powerball first try is. 

We giving thing ton dicerolls. planet getting millions chances. incredibly unlikely happen, remember someone eventually hits powerball.... You’re right, don’t logically seeing many kids together school yard. never allowed even pre-covid get ""not immediately"", kill back normal 2023. Lately, there's lot talk summer 2021, would perfect.  USA USA USA USA gonna touch psychological downsides masks already another comment. Chilling one friend usual bubble, turkey potatoes, super stoned what? people probably enjoy it. long forcing lifestyle forcing lifestyle cares? Except lie something immediately pressing issue public health safety, cashing huge amount public trust small, temporary gain. trust loss, misinformation paranoia runs rampant. Right, instead interacting 50 strangers day every day, go world work. top b2b customers, delivery drivers, repair men, number people come go industrial sites day. Hopefully, statement fact. OP wrong make one. Right people significantly restricting behavior. goes away, lower R0 offset people coming contact eachother. Like said, hopefully net lower, really know. idiot. 20 years old. Ruined life. multiple articles saying vaccines return normal least immediately. totally understand exasperation though. made two pies two people lol. Also 8lbs turkey good amount sides. family growing usually make multiple pies home due lots kids house. Please share sources. ones I’ve read link mask use decline transmission flu. Goddamn right will! gonna rebel totally authoritarian U.S. gov't burnin' masks, refusin' wash hands, spendin' Thanksgiving weekend salivatin' o'er grammas, grampas, aunts, uncles, cousins, brothers!

America! long fan draconian level measures get things control. 
No, mean welding peoples’ doors shut like happened Wuhan. 
I mean mandated full shut downs places people congregate w/o strict truly essential need. 
That means office workers able WFH must so. 
A company caught asking people come would subject massive fines: think $50k / occurrence. 
There could bounty system offenders could turned tipster paid upon confirmation offense. 
I’m sure people disagree attack this, say behalf 2k people / day dying able live this. 

Also, anyone financially hit get support. 
I afraid point way financially support though. 
The US could avoided disaster someone else helm, issue created need figure get it, cost tremendous. dense? moreso fact masks subconsciously communicate idea everyone around disease vector must avoided. Masks subconsciously communicate others, ""Please interact me."" trouble communicating people wear masks way trouble talking grocery store employees coworkers. mean they're remotely conducive toward healthy social life.

Holy hell wish people would acknowledge masks little piece cloth covers filthy disease hole. real drawbacks, matter many times say, ""It's mask, bro,"" change reality.  Good nutrition certainly hurt, might help some. Curious supplements recommend, use ones mention already? Also using good masks staying much possible.

Getting enough sleep staying well hydrated good ideas. People push extremes, may workplaces already shifting combined remote on-site reporting schedules COVID. accelerate trend. People 5 days/week office 1-3. stay full time. almost fully remote. Shared offices workspaces going become common. won’t return complete 180. answer somewhere two. showing symptoms late, already spread it. worse anti-vaxer. I’m technically ignoring “not gather people outside house” since live alone. I’m going see parents dinner, that’s different week since go dinner time. consider household. surveyed would say following guidelines. imagine lot people answered similar situations. read facebook? realize exactly like anti-vaxer? Worse even tiny miniscule risk adverse effects vaccine, zero adverse effects mask. talking about? Airlines aren’t shut *never* were. Depends person. people love work home everyday others want office. Personally, I'd love something like 3/2 2/3 split. Also, live populated metro area long commutes heavy traffic working home might preferable socialization office. Long congested commutes daily soul drainers. Moderna AZ's trial protocols mention periodic blood tests asymptomatic infections. Well probably think interacting 500 strangers everyday. Sorry, reading one particular passage stood out:

""Even vaccines prevent disease, social distancing guidelines remain in-tact, explains. Even people protected, may still able spread virus someone else without ever getting sick themselves.

“The recommendation ongoing even vaccinated people maintain social distancing mask-wearing, make lot people grumpy,” Schaffner says""

....so goal posts moving again? vaccines going enough? kill that's case? Basically everyone know traveling. No, 42% less, thats current social distancing environment. restrictions lift people get asymptomatic infections come contact goes seems like would good idea offer vaccines employees families. employees healthy, less stressed family healthy, begin help community get feet, make local economy healthy. Win, win, win. We’re same. Duck seemed like adventurous alternative. don’t want eat turkey month. Rules thee, me! something egregiously hypocritical shows either liar person willing literally kill others order nice get-together ... he’s *awesome.* definitely right, whatever reason decided work information yet (I suspect asymptomatic infections quite high) may sheltered upbringing, yet encounter situation actively needed brass knuckles. me, point, seems EXTREMELY small minority actually following this. Every single one friends acquaintances least couple people Thanksgiving traveling themselves, full fledged normal celebration. Even ones respectably careful point. 

This one times question sanity. small family gets together Thanksgiving every year too, decided sacrifice year. even take minute discussion, super obvious ""yeah let's take one year that, duh"". feel like big deal celebrate Thanksgiving one single year whole life, benefit saving someone getting sick and/or dying. we're LITERALLY ones know that. mind blown. What?! It’s Americans? /s somebody covid think like took Pfizer vaccine. seems 93% chance developing immunity covid close taking vaccine. Honestly, seems like considering tested positive antibodies, he’s part 93% might fine. live normally wear mask pretty much everywhere relaxed bit social distancing (i.e. feel relaxed gym stuff). two cents.

To knowledge odds still spreading fall within 93%, got likely would mild case (and capsule spread it) considering antibodies still solid.

I’d worry setting bad example though, that’s whole different discussion.   read response laughed. watch college ball! mountain west always super fun weird they've got two games tomorrow China winning smart leaders take decisive action immediately, ongoing joke hoax 45% nation. also succeeded spreading Propaganda nationwide school district administrative staff holding federal funding hostage close schools. 
The issue systemic. worried companies wanting people go back office jobs point one, worrying companies shrugging hiring remote workers point two.

You're worrying sake worrying, apparently.

But calm nerves, things think about:

1. Less people buying lunch, coffee, etc, product fewer people even jobs disposable income. transitioned temporary work home situation, novelty able eat home still that...novel. people actually *enjoy* eating three meals day home, time goes on, WFH people absolutely start pining off-site lunchbreaks.
2. Time zones still exist, major hassle comes communication. businesses would rather everyone within three hour time zone gap continental United States deal one part team Europe, another US, another Asia....it creates 24 hour work schedule, people actually *want* deal with.

A trend working home harbinger doom worrying about. Ecuador, knew problem, bodies left streets burned fields. face. “optics” mass burials exactly need right now. refrigerated morgue trucks ne painted red big block letters say: Keep back: Mobile Morgue Vehicle, COVID -19. Park every corner. conspiracy theorists children. don’t SEE dead dying, can’t happening. Society’s mistake indulge them. hard, cold logic reasoning sound like it’ll track mind? I'm healthcare worker hate say still woefully unprepared. staff, supplies, sure infrastructure. mean lack enough negative pressure hospital rooms, enough negative pressure equipped operating rooms emergencies, enough housekeeping staff clean turn around rooms, adequate facilities staff change work clothes, let alone doff protective equipment proper way. patients get 2 hour rapid turn around test. need testing get line hours wait days results.

Lots gallows humor work, charge nurses putting brave face publicly private tell fucked. incident work exposed literally dozens staff (neither first last) zero follow up. expectation show work make whatever staff supplies unless sick come in. point get testing treatment.... Leaving process simply due fact messed sets dangerous precedent would allow federal government completely sidestep local state governments. Unless lawfully removed office would make sense respect people include elected representatives process. send federal employees supervise make sure handling situation correctly.  misinterpretation current knowns. Symptom severity positively correlated viral shedding, know much. implies asymptomatic infections tend pass infection less eventually develop symptoms. implication obviously difficult prove, check Nature article Truly asymptomatic cases 42% less likely spread disease, another meta-study suggesting risk spread asymptomatic people 1/4 (!) risk presymptomatic symptomatic spread. [Chinese studies also suggest much, none 1174 close contacts asymptomatic infections becoming infected themselves.  


At least, know Pfizer Moderna vaccines make 90% people vaccine develop, worst, asymptomatic infection (and think quite likely substantial number people gain sterilizing immunity efficacy rate). Thus, given information above, see reduction R0. 1 person responsible turning thing political thank God, less 2 months BS. Police say Tusing also razor blade pocket. 

He pull weapon. right it'd unethical that. Participants usually selected level they're public facing. They're told go business recommended level precautions including masking distancing. Pfizer made effort include participants talking about, yes. know works elderly. Well imo experience gained I’d always prefer advice experience gained rather before. Also heard lot supply + making sure got people really needed it.

Regardless think agree wasn’t handled ideally. Thanks civil discussion ! :) Yeah. look forward vaccines. bunch nitwits get them. lost pandemic. piss people they'll forget 2024 still support you. can't piss rest America expect same. 

Edited remove references politics apparently can't discuss people responsible current state pandemic pandemic subreddit. humanitarian crisis, stupid human crisis. Oh, actually misunderstood, apologize. thought completely underplaying Covid cases Poland, think see point.

I think mean Covid deaths high Poland, also exaggerated hospitals, right? first outbreaks virus would spread around world even without mutation, believe researchers, including Dr. Engelthaler. original variant spotted Wuhan, China, late 2019 already highly contagious, said. mutation appears made pandemic spread faster would without it.

I wonder many agencies seemed little thrown March? Ignoring politics bureaucracy regular agency foot dragging, I'm curious initial data Wuhan anticipating virus acted certain way certain speed caught guard started moving differently? Sort like baseball player expecting curveball getting fastball. 

Regardless, important recognize thesis correct we're potentially dealing trickier virus March, seemed hard enough contain. That's terribly reassuring; hope containment difficulties offset virus that's less injurious contract it. could force governor's mayor's actually enforce mask use, social distancing. say it. appreciated, people want listen, let able treated. think needs get far though. doctors nurses told governor's got one week enforce mask mandates, close indoor dining, bars, gyms, walk. Let governor's explain people there's one hospitals treat sick. title edited:

Coronavirus NYC News: New York City plan reopen schools coming next week, de Blasio says death lag huge. 

You see right course daily death counts always look like they're trending due lag. news highly-effective vaccines nearing emergency federal approval offers new hope fight COVID-19 pandemic, intensive care units South Florida’s largest hospital systems seeing familiar grim pattern emerge. 
Following weeks rising COVID-19 cases hospitalizations heading fall, ICUs Miami-area hospitals say increasing numbers patients severe disease needing intubated breathe. Medical experts fear that, previous surges, number deaths pandemic rise well coming weeks. 
Across Miami-Dade County, number patients ICUS rose sharply last several days, 125 Saturday 158 Tuesday morning — 25% 658 Covid-positive hospital patients total day. 
Dr. David De La Zerda, critical care physician medical director Jackson Memorial Hospital’s intensive care unit Miami, said expecting increase number critically ill patients weeks rising case numbers reached average 2,000 cases per day. 
As done since spring, De La Zerda pleaded South Floridians take virus seriously. lag cases spike hospitalizations start surge, said, often lull public false sense security. 
“You see positive cases think maybe relax virus changing,” said, ”but it’s changing.” 
The latest wave severely ill COVID patients Jackson coming top ICUs already filled patients brought reasons, delayed surgeries medical care postponed due pandemic, De La Zerda added. Though Florida’s fall resurgence virus trailed behind states spiking cases, Midwest, recent weeks brought accelerated virus growth Florida well. 
“Now everybody here, full ICU non-COVID full ICUs COVID,” De La Zerda said “And think that’s different first time, people weren’t going hospital.” 
Mary Jo Trepka, epidemiologist professor Florida International University, said last week expected number patients Miami’s intensive care units rise soon. Wednesday, expectation materialized, Trepka said Miami-Dade’s epidemic trajectory “sadly predictable” — rising cases followed rising hospitalizations, followed rising levels patients intensive care finally, tragically, rising deaths. 
The infectious disease expert wasn’t predicting things would get better virus time soon. 
“It’s we’ve reached peak — we’re still surging,” Trepka said. “I fear we’re going well 2,000 \[cases\] day coming weeks, hospitals really going start get full get stretched.” 
MORE MIAMI HOSPITALS 
Dr. Yvonne Johnson, chief medical officer South Miami Hospital, part Baptist Health South Florida, said goal past couple weeks brace next several months vaccines arrive general public, perhaps early next spring. 
“That bright light end dark tunnel,” Johnson said. “But still tunnel get through, really incumbent upon us everything get safely tunnel vaccine widely available.” 
Johnson said outcomes end intensive care units Baptist Health hospitals haven’t shifted much since summer surge, though physicians nurses gotten better treating disease. 
“For people, they’re weeks intensive care I’d say majority patients walk back front door, seen significant amount mortality course pandemic,” Johnson said. 
Like Jackson’s De La Zerda, Johnson agreed little changed far many people admitted COVID-19 become severely ill known risk groups: older medical conditions, example, others young seemingly healthy contract virus. 
Physicians nurses learned manage respiratory care people struggling breathe, there’s still treatment specifically COVID-19, little known effectiveness broad-range antivirals like remdesivir. Johnson called “steep learning curve.” 
“We absolutely gained greater understanding treating disease, can’t say kind miracle type treatment available us right now,” said. “The best therapy right prevention. It’s getting it.” ... well putting eyes issue country gets exposure due incompetent government tries hide failures despite crushing world records daily death population. socialize strangers? many years worn mask friends socialize with? think problem mask. problem talking people mask on. 

You think nurses doctors incapable talking masks? way posted makes sense hearing impaired rely reading lips. quality person get politician election uncompetitive. think he's worried general election? chance. Big city political machine keep there. retirement home work hasn’t single covid death amongst residents. i’m proud staff taking seriously, i’m also terrified ever fear luck efforts take turn worse coming weeks. mostly correct, DeSantis appears taking view running show, allowing *death thousand cuts* local authorities might inflict. Somehow needs made clear needs break oath office, order save state. background lawyer, maverick, I'm holding breath. entire legislature passed non-binding referendum, might give enough political cover right thing, much faith legislature either. democracy, entire group citizens, get majority elected, whether deserve not. Croatia definitely reached capacity. Romania might too. **Affiliation:** University Nevada, Reno, Department Clinical Psychology

LMAO. that's good day  Memory cells B cells remain viable body decades, produce new antibodies pathogen encountered again. measure antibody response use proxy immunity simple reaction test, tells whole story.

The mutation rate SARS-CoV-2 relatively low, unlike influenza virus. course, know sure, could end seasonal vaccinations. probably not. worry insane food bank lines hospital beds reaching capacity, Dow Jones hit 30 thousand covid denier Elon Musk second richest man world. going well everyone. 

do need /s? Iraq/Iran mortal enemies (at least Saddam charge), could totally see conflicts Syria/Yemen escalating. school required leave Thanksgiving break unless lived 4 5 hour drive away. thing I'd say promising they've seen evidence transmission stopped vaccine. stringent testing virus. hope mhra impacted unbelievable demand virus actually take good look data. virus better suited younger generations slows transmission maybe priority changes use Pfizer vaccine older generations, rest society.  Potential? many, grandma's already dead. hey, love dry turkey? Like said, impact essentially zero, they're person angry at. wouldn’t say rises impeachment level.

It’s hypocritical, illegal. guess it’s sounded almost unethical told socialize guess you’d avoid assuming would. I’m sure someone got placebo changed behavior?

That’s all. doesn’t virus get stuck them? explain not?

Sorry I’m kinda stressed out. understanding embarassing read. Literally simplistic cliches ability think. shame adult childish assume greater good company also align greater good people situation customers dying.

:D I'm downvoted mostly think Reddit hates bosses small business owners. FF8 favorite series, think that’s fact first FF ever. mean experts met large gathering dinner masks social distancing? Sure man. people tell you, people can’t even follow rules. That's actually really believe too. watch listen right wing media, day day out. fills heads fear. Admitting covid real deadly much handle. bury truth deep inside psyche, feel better.  zoom! miss spaces. miss existing spaces, miss moving spaces. space, work-sleep-pod forever. Maybe two-three month shut bailout small businesses low income people. Corporations made billions first shutdown. Time pay back. F Hey that's fair rocks comparing unfathomably stupid 100 daily deaths 6000 reported cases, must symtpomatic. Fly thanksgiving, yet miss quarantine. Nope, guy won’t either. ADA law federal IEP law-special education students MUST receive services yes, even pandemic. Nothing that. big fucking deal. thumb looked like that, I’d seek medical attention. Please take beer goggles. get eye exam. Maybe both. Fastest two week quarantine ever. Thanksgiving tomorrow. Rtx 3080 gets today. :D Brass knuckles, meet silver bracelets. governor Illinois maybe thing. part reason people take recommendations seriously. LOL thought he'd stick around state he's doomed due absolutely awful leadership ?  


This man New Zealand Taiwan somewhere relax people governs dies . aboit 1% gonna Christmas funerals. Oh well. listened. problem, one died contained fast, problem. camps crowded anymore, live homes already. think made proportion comparison feel like popular prior TMNT, though. Maybe Karate Kid sparked interest Japanese stuff general, even movie wasn’t fighting weapons. bit late update numbers today, sorry.

No need apologize! amazingly consistent posts months. R next name ballot. dont need ... ninja throwing stars ... always look like thumb? really upsetting elected officials lead example. still blame people using common sense, stunts like make say, well it, listen him? need stop lowering bar much are. Exponentials middle school math.

I agree this. reason, math particular socially acceptable bad at, admitting bad reading cause shame people. IMO, point learning math, especially middle/high school, learn logic problem-solving skills useful throughout whole life, necessarily solve triangle graph function. However, solving triangles graphing functions still useful skills themselves, like case better understand rate viruses spread.

Just add comment since pointed thread, also false dichotomy? What's wrong education system teaches ""pragmatic"" information alongside math? vaccines work care others don’t get them. Students schools lobby, problem. still done enough despite much pressure teachers etc. wrestler, she'd announced Ladies Gentlemen, please welcome Governorrrrrrr Kristi ""The Killerrrrrrrrr"" Noem. ask something? Sincerely? realize many people around burning inside anger? Anger knowing words. Anger realizing live society everyone define ‘freedom’ see fit. Anger coward morally unsound daring speak up. 

No, we’re angry failing sacrifice little save lot. No, we’re morally mentally exhausted disappointed ourselves. inability communicate. inability stand together fight save dearest ones. 

So, go fun dinner. Don’t let angry faces distract you. merely angry themselves. enough vaccines everyone awhile anyways really messed releasing information. got sick virus, age group, etc. 90% people got 50 mild symptoms/no hospitalisation 63% efficacy look bad. Like flu jab stops 80% hospitalisations stop people getting actual flu.  got friends area, I'm part anti-social shut in. Wow.  Slang vaccine given injection. think commonly used UK, Australia, New Zealand. Idk long takes get test back he's from. obviously that. I'm suggesting room take test live somewhere else meantime. live alone. started self quarantining day hairdresser became sick. thing went tested. continue I’m completely asymptomatic, probably days beyond that. would never want pass anyone. dude fuck that. son autism would able attend school without aides. miracle workers Well misdemeanor probably big fine jail time, wanting wear mask. earth would assume that? single fact warrants assumption? hear judgment, fine.

Short answer: easier.

Long answer: managing family's various needs (physical, emotional, financial), daily household chores errands, work/career, I'm picking battles.

Every family survival mode - since March here, schools daycares cut kids see friends family. playdates, Grandma babysitting, even closed playgrounds while. Schools daycares now, region recently went red, they've banned playdates (WTF) every parent know holding breath everything shuts again.

It's heartwarming, twisted way, know I'm alone trying pick gets priority. I'm glad, even, kids school; that's fun new battle.

If capable awesome parenting things, keeping home collapsing inside, thriving career concurrently, great! kids eating fish sticks three days row, wearing clothes long, gotten around e-mails many days, hey, hear you.

In perfect world, kids watch much TV. times tough I'll settle surviving another day. wonder Denver mayor, Mike Hancock politician high profile figure, caught red handed hypocrite. press shadowing frequent medical experts appear cable news telling us covid, see whether hypocrites well. definitely looks like law-and-order guy. don’t know amazing thanksgiving dinners....but never excited soggy bread stuffed carcass dry chicken. dinner every night enjoyable standard thanksgiving dinner meal....Christmas right around corner states anyways really need two holidays back back?  general, legitimate medical reason someone can't vaccinated, delay vaccine long necessary skip entirely depending issue. herd immunity kicks - everyone around person vaccinated, still safe. 

However, many legitimate reasons people can't vaccinated involve health issues put higher risk (eg: cancer treatment), may still want taking precautions. 

Additionally, settings, workers might restricted certain jobs (eg: hospital worker might allowed near patients work medical records/ pharmacy/etc.). variation play volunteering hospital H1N1.

Finally, things fall category privilege, right. citizen country, they're generally *required* let in. daycare *have* accept kids unless reason they're excluding illegal (race, religion, etc). question. I’ve wearing mask washing hands thinking sanitize stuff like phone, earbuds wallet?  old still give silent treatment? straight selfish assholery. still person full time Thanksgiving elementary middle school. High school A/B schedule  US, definitely. part trial big enough 63% efficant barely worth using rich countries. part trial 90% efficacy US even part trial. 

I'm sure every dose used somewhere, though. ""big"" problem unless can't actually figure get 70% efficacy. 

Off topic: ""efficant""? Reminds percentage tests done month November? Lol “fracture country.” since least 2008 Cheers. certainly hope right. 
I lot doubt though.... Oh shit know sounds awful say, one people look same.

Generally, white, fat, pouty, angry, stupid almost swinish. 

I mean could line 100 people randomly could pick anti-mask types without even asking questions. Thank you. sucks stories getting told. Anything post social media get us fired- every hospital I've worked policy. almost anything might try share media HIPPAA violation (and also get us fired fined both). dying take pictures isolation ""anterooms"" literally constructed plastic painter's dropcloth duct tape can't lose job it. I've thought taking pictures hiding inevitable exposes get written/filmed. Hospitals mostly get paid fee-for-service model. incentive provide unnecessary care bill rather underproviding care. Insurance companies also don’t really care health expenses going profits capped law based dollar value claims they’re paying out. Rules thee, we're talking 3-4 months. !RemindMe 6 weeks Blood clots block circulation You’re fine dude don’t worry. clearly far enough away covid primarily spreads indoors anyways, outdoor contact. ""excess deaths""? Something like 1/3 nursing homes alone. going pretend know statistics, lets look disability adjusted life years here, real bottom line.
And clearly understand anything Second World War. ""freedom liberty"" versus evil, Hitler v. Stalin. ally fighting better evil supposedly needed snuff out. Open history book once. Stupid people generally can't afford luxuries long haul flights. Fairly simple. Depends data says planned dose. 

There questions aggregating data Brazil UK. That's common practice begin problematic here. situations UK Brazil similar, either virus circulation mitigation. 

Its unlikely anyone approve unplanned dose. Trial big enough properly controlled.   Bruh. Healthcare workers felt abused. it’s worse time. bad time. Sounds like “Do say, Do” attitude...smh OMG that's Donnie ""knuckles"" Spillsum chronic masturbator Ohio...we helluva time highjinx junior high. *What negative effects could society, functioning, economy, healthcare etc*

Counter-intuitively, society would actually better people started dying sooner due COVID. majority healthcare expenses goes towards end-of-life care people die younger less expensive society handle. see effect smokers: care costs smokers given age much 40 percent higher nonsmokers, population one smoked costs would 7 percent higher among men 4 percent higher among women costs current mixed population smokers nonsmokers. smokers quit, health care costs would lower first, 15 years would become higher present. I’m anti-vaxxer tbf. Fuck anti-vaxxers. point correct wanted point lot children die COVID specifically. death rate children increases diseases. collection people believe personal freedoms supersede best interest community and, feel impotent, resort threats violence. Must...travel...can’t...resist Damn getting deep Vote out. bad leadership. lead example Mr. Mayor. Yup.. think lot people entitled never faced real adversity lives. wish. we'll see December make 9/11 seem like fender bender. say lightly jokingly. mean, that's kind problem, too. people get COVID come around say ""I wrong, terrible made mistake big get-together."" like people say things like ""I made 70's without seatbelts."" Like, yeah, good you, bunch people didn't, never heard paid attention it. DeSantis Disappeared? Sounds oddly familiar. know another republican politician taken questions three weeks. DeSantis really Trump lite. yes, op-eds regular news articles point step toward permanent WFH employees. writers publishing articles speculated good thing. 

seems like really reading articles. Governor Kristi “Dig ditches burn witches” Noem Covenir's? First off, like disparaging people Asperger's ""malfunctioning brains"". bigotry might another reason trouble making friends. 

You still described theoretical fantasy situation attempt chat someone mask prevents it. I'll say again, describe social situation talking mask stops chatting someone up? Stop Putin propaganda. him, give damn that, guess simplistic CNN infused brain still gotten it. apologize tried keep simple someone clearly understanding company want contribute shrinking customer base. 

Looks like AstraZeneca cheating data :D sure nothing profits!!! **But do.** strongly disagree mandates. lot people do. cost human lives regardless whether believe cost worth benefit, cost government *lot* legitimacy. derives power consent governed, remember.

I wanted smart people ones revolt dude. trumpist regrettables. disappear. can't see face cause head Trump's ass. feel like already radicalized end places like that. could wrong people become Nazis overnight. steady shift time. Yep. Thought going Amber alert. little disconcerting. Me.

If could safely go big party everyone, I'd go.

But every single one us agreed year it, we'll cross fingers hope 2021. That's always wear mask
And person could coughing many reasons mean covid Source? could lead civil unrest could fracture country point.

What country living in? helps clear things up, thanks! He's worse that, actively supports culling Americans age 65 preexisting conditions publicly promotes viewpoint others. wartime situation would easily see traitor. people follow rules even disagree, damn people stubborn. remember stubborn like 5, fun almost. !RemindMe 2 months

My prediction: things start slowing December we'll fine mid January I’ll look country comparison, website garbage phone. That’s fair. I’ll check out.

Thank debate. got tested upon arrival? Good you. Keep wearing rest life. you? issues right? One reason get vaccine protect yourself. Another reason contribute herd immunity, everyone attitude ""I need vaccine since people getting it"", get herd immunity. people medically can't get vaccines rely herd immunity.

The way talk sounds whole lot like antivax arguments matter since long get vaccine, protected. That's getting flak. usually beginning disingenuous antivax argument. 10 people I've recently spoken plans, I'm one going anywhere. Sure, keeping guest list small, meeting people outside home. said, ""we're anything big, getting together xyz"".

I havent seen it. photo ID?

It's going using thing every day get work use public transport, different requirement something pull blue moon. fortitude right country. mildly inconvenienced, can’t handle it. can’t follow mandates, stay home. Yes, month first vaccination generally considered needed immune response reach maximum.

Doses repeated reduce fraction people responding, strengthen immune responses, extend duration protection.

If get exposed before, chances protection lower, zero. That’s basically you’re heading. 

Only instead dead body may family members loved ones, poor cashier checks entitled self old lady misfortune cross mouth breathing path. 

You coward hiding behind twisted platitude pretend acting like selfish, entitled, ignorant child. No, whole thing hasn’t along party lines start, unless course believe colleges trendy bar scene strongholds right. Employers make getting vaccine mandatory make sure employee paid time get shots. make mandatory wear mask medical professionals say ok wear mask. US states ranked per capita 7-day deaths (check states ranked total per capita Paywall Yes, private company, chose requirements want travel. Right already need vaccines travel different countries. population workers constantly overlooked..direct support professionals. lost 14 individuals agency, many lived group homes. agencies hit 2-3x hard us. since individuals aren’t going anywhere (program closed time), DSP’s bringing home, super sad think about. really hope consider distributing vaccine. caused lot cognitive memory loss issues

Did psychedelics cause cognitive issues drugs? I'm sure right Fox damaged much, I'm wondering network end giving moving right, they'll hold onto scruples seemingly have. Honestly, me, one interesting things happen Fox ages, considering persistent lying old hat now... can't say much Netherlands, except know guys balls-out summer (but seems still since imposing mandatory masks indoors next month) looking number tests can't really confident case numbers. half tests per 1M inhabitants countries like Spain Germany. course, test, get lots confirmed cases. seem many deaths, why, know... bikes? counting people co-morbidities? good protecting old? clue. truth countries lot deaths time relax order help economy, get hit head.

Applying something works Sweden Spain nice good long realistic it. Sweden different hospital system Spain, another population density well. one think stupid wear mask always outside, like impose Spain. even counter productive: people prefer staying home, going bar, seeing friends family indoors really dangerous. policy seems good paper awful practice. hand, indoors crowd: masks! care ""freedom"", put on, nose well. 

I'm unwilling spend year indoors like people would like 80 year old get live another year die flu next season. I'm also willing change lot stuff life prevented. case, I'm germophobe: I've washing hands coughing elbow decades! wish everybody it, without corona. can’t dense. there’s threat someone coming spreading them. Exactly. I'm going start going recipes enjoy myself. Ah ... it’s clear. Thanks much! Yeah MMR, DTaP, polio eradication status locally, US least, due vaccination programs. work. years back. Keep record stuff love hate current employer make sure included next contract. position demand company pinch they'll sign almost anything severely conflict them.

Saved ass twice past 8 years implemented new employment rules procedures original contract superceded them. want relinquish benefits buy contract. claim idea caught virus. always wear mask store. local hospital using COVID shield cut retirement benefits health benefits starting January 1, basically stating know can’t strike, hospital full. nurses tried strike people literally driving sidewalks trying hit them, throwing garbage calling murderers. Literally social media attacking nurses, hospital. Even news basically like, they’ve got four floors full COVID patients nurses want benefits? Wow, aren’t pieces shit. eventually gave literally one side. community hates benefits still getting slashed. US yesterday 2,194 deaths new high, morning's daily death reports Europe US equivalent numbers: Bulgaria 7,504, Belgium 5,124, Poland 5,854, Hungary 3,636, Croatia 4,519, Austria 3,303, Romania 2,889 Thank you, makes clearer. theyre hesitant exacerbating death toll stop complaining? Lol what? People already done personal risk assessment virus.

No. People decided want do, *and then* cherry picked news justify smart safe.

Since decisions based data first place, unlikely new data change minds. like need carry driver's license credit card.

There reason app. existing paper form cheap, works international standard. Colorado better shape many states. Here's latest case/death charts, running state 49.49 deaths per 100k, well US per capita average 77.55. 

Colorado ranks 35th per capita Glad messing about. mentioned article, lockdowns proven work (e.g. France right now) That's dirty word USA.  I'm guessing live somewhere warm and/or wear glasses. There's literally news stories people get virus preventative measures taken.  ""Maybe won't, smart kids will""
-my teacher friend, someone said surprising. Sadly. doubt get better. 

Change something Japan excels at. turned away hospital certificate also used venues, work, etc .. *they* able check International Certificate Vaccination? guy music festival able tell? spot forgeries? need extra person checking cards? etc etc. guy fixed it. People die hold funerals! open now! Use VPN, St. Louis. Virtually anyways guess grow then. 😔 would personally rather Moderna Pfizer one least 5% effective, 35% effective. cancer nothing like highly contagious viral pandemic. What's point here? Yeah, too. focusing general population though. government uses time stir pot much possible nothing short criminal. Thank you. obvious me. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ updated original comment context, give idea.

see ya 2024! ;) even 1% ugly greater issue 20% persevere thru infection severe side effects going forward mind keeping mask go next year. big deal.

This honestly mind boggling thing whole situation me. Wearing mask just... big deal. all. small convenience yet people fight literal slaves wear one. luck, looks like trials started August. deserve neither freedom safety. You’d collaborator, don’t forget red band around arm. You’re reason comply masks vaccines. dead body. Google translator ;) written teleconsultation remote consultation. Yeah, that's medical care Poland right now. Next time someone tells can't fight fate, ask coal miner slave serf indentured servant. one point throughout history pretty much everyone's fate... fought it. It’s control months. brother law huge anti-masker also lot work involving construction maintenance. could contract virus time I’m planning wear mask constantly home.

I’ve long since acknowledged contracting COVID control. thing avoid giving others. I’d say definitely brings air normalization vaccines. Lol Hey, us delusional. many people hate whole party, definitely way many people worshipping him, sadly... statistically significant, means difference infection rate groups could explained chance. Thank right thing. get better. found 19yo guy consolidating data hobby.



Imagine entering adulthood distract mind fucked world, end discovering actual proof fucked world is. Don’t go. least protect household maybe inspire people drop well. lowlights, really.

Unfortunately, modern world, instinct entirely counterproductive -- overwhelming majority modern societal, political economic ills *caused* greedy, me-first right-wing policies, resulting vicious cycle something goes shit, direct result people demand even worse leaders fuck even more. genuinely think ""seemingly innocuous"" trait one pays much attention could, without hyperbole, ends destroying humanity. hope find way overcome it, given usual dynamics power potentially something issue ones directly benefiting it, honestly seems fairly hopeless...

Thank you’re doing, shouldn’t deal this. Dear god people. Remember sub supposed proven facts statistics? Reading article felt like reading someone's comment reddit bunch non-proven personal experience ramble. 


They lost story 40 year woman nothing covid losing short term memory. Like okay cool get back covid claim? 


This article makes plenty arbitrary % claims 1 volume number, 1 mention age ranges, information timing. Literally NOTHING.

This reads like anti-vaccer article claiming 70% people autism clinic vaccinated child. let tell random person wasnt vaccinated got autism struggle recover. Oh look another doctor saying theyre seeing number vaccinated patients getting autisms.

cmon r/Coronavirus we're supposed better hype articles literally hold real value make people point say ""See!"" reading headline. scary, going lie. Ironically single person involved 9/11 Afghanistan. two western countries unique advantage entirely isolated world compared hundreds countries (and Australia still living restrictions again, point lol) implemented lockdowns. Yeah odds aren’t really favor realistic working strategy is. don’t rely hope. It’s late smart safe. second job food delivery. need money currently.
otherwise, agree. No, cannot. “Platform” vs “Publisher” distinction thing. Interesting. able share example one provisions? I'm exactly like stated - never negotiate anything beyond salary start date. Never really thought anything else could negotiate for. people complaining rushed cause side effects microchips implanted folks would never get vaccine anyway. 

And FYI, 5 minute google search doesn’t equate decades research experience lab months virus testing vaccines. lot free time hands. :)

Why? want Thanksgiving like we're middle pandemic giving want, version reality. 

I can't fathom people's beliefs comments over. think hoax, conspiracy whole world on. 

I can't imagine living delusion. going another ""It's American want it""? mention everyone anywhere close quality medical help head state does. Poland adopted mind set Red US states, stupid health professionals telling opposite promoting punished crime ones people pretty much almost exactly China well following advisory contact tracing, quarantines/lockdowns masks - national scale.

Americans surprised this, entire east asia many south east asia countries COVID free like Singapore, Vietnam I'm : Brunei. Re-infection SARS-CoV-2 confirmed minute number cases area ongoing research. development universal vaccine influenza another one. two topics entirely related. shorter quarantine period might improve things feasible people do. problem 14 day quarantine one take 2 weeks job US. 5 day period government paid it, think lot people would follow process. that’s mission change world, it. think there’s productive battles one could choose debating semantics/jargon, you. unnecessary surveillance ^ misinformation.

Whitmer, gov Michigan, actually business owners TV COVID TV conference, ENCOURAGING people shop in-person! last week! late. family hosting TG. 17 people one roof. Hope get unscathed. show symptoms sick, show symptoms. 

What’s hard understand? late. People minds made up. can't imagine getting much worse are. bet wasn’t first family gathering family. time someone brought virus party. mean factors sterilizing immunity vs. non-sterilizing immunity (whether virus protects infection vs. severe illness- opinion latter still great thing). let's say provide sterilizing immunity. 5-10% chance getting infected may low enough maybe myself. others may feel like that's rolling dice we're considering social end pandemic that's important info. don’t think travelers suddenly get sudden priority, even they’re willing pay exorbitant amounts money. even can, number people practically afford dumping money (probably several times ticket itself) get vaccine early far it’ll insignificant amount. Even significant, vaccinated person vaccinated person, especially one traveling. quite literally mitigate chance several thousands future cases since person potential major choke point. Combined fact mandatory vaccines thing quite (I can’t go home country US without whole slew shots), neither precedent setting radical. 

What likely happen people look like “damn, need vaccinated go Ibiza summer, hmm let register get one earliest available time, not, oh well, won’t buy ticket” “I’ll go somewhere else doesn’t need vaccinated”. Overall whether actually changes gets vaccinated critical, matters people get vaccinated. far, seems like that’ll hard enough incentive better none. barely get people take normal vaccines, let alone publicized vaccine known man.  do. Again, look Australia New Zealand clear examples that. even close old. You’ll fine. Cry more. multiple strains every virus. precludes vaccine protection mutations specific locations targeted vaccine. know yet case SARS-CoV-2. Yikes Fingers crossed Lyme vaccine! thing making crazy big light end tunnel now. accounts, vaccines going distributed near future, becoming available general public time next spring. signs point to, warm weather + vaccines next year going make next year million times better.

I'd empathetic end sight, one year holidays point. final stretch race; time celebrate quite yet. Sounds like don’t yet know vaccine prevents ‘carrier’ virus.  know sure everyone vaccinated, you’d need still safe (mask social distance etc) would herd immunity spread right states trying slow spread?

Do think one way achieving ""herd immunity"" naturally?

Clearly think way let virus run wild infect many people short period time.

But actual strategy controlling speed spread hospitals overwhelmed cases, still allow spread continue slower rate eventually herd immunity would reached.

As Tegnell put form like forest fires things, make burn little slowly carefully, make burn out. 

Note: talking putting fire, instead talking making burn slowly carefully.

The goal achieve herd immunity without overwhelming hospitals.

You deny want, abundant evidence early pandemic herd immunity goal. joined Reddit beginning pandemic.. exactly? Okay lockdowns do.... don’t work? I’m getting mixed signals. Maybe never herd immunity policy..? That's like accusing someone something clearly true, becoming agitated pointing out. really going pretty far way pretend understand arguing UK island, haven’t noticed. I'm market policy analyst. Government relations, economics, data analysis, etc.

My hourly positions younger course individual contracts. Half time employment contract all. advice would likely apply career track able move companies depending market demand.

It seems people stop employment negotiation hit salary discussion. that's less important elements negotiate. Yeah, can't wait see long term damage heart! *yay*

Have good one boomer. Lol skewing quotes fit narrative ""in epidemiological terms"" know this? get qualifications? people seemed excited Oxford vaccine early skeptical Moderna. Makes wonder. 250,000 what? Hoaxes? 

-obviously /s 

If people say fuck 250,000 people, say fuck 9/11. mean jack shit. less .00004% population, people FEARING TERRORISM? Bunch sheeps. I've seen people growing lax honestly.  StarTrek/Wars. Shelbot have. :P take back word ""welfare""? We're trying stimulate economy here, we're trying insure people's welfare safety. welfare checks that's good thing - care people's welfare economy's state stimulation. Yeah, sorry calling catholic church fucking hypocrites are. backwards stance another type personal protection, they've singlehandedly responsible millions deaths pandemic. Makes sense. see... right it’s way worse US  yep, ignore it. kids dont look sick don’t complain let’s ignore it. it’s brutal... 

imagine 20 years new zealand going win every gold medal sport... can’t compete don’t 100% fitness. 

the difference olympic athlete great athlete milliseconds... Lawyer basicly poland gonna path like usa much worse ? estimated probably hundreds millions cases already people say “traveling”. mean guess it’s good people aren’t getting plane, still getting together people don’t live still contributing problem. Somehow everyone thinks covid bubble safe forget multiply number include peoples bubble well. omfg. 

it's literally impossible change mind. head Swden's coronavirus response says wrong. They've started implementing bunch restrictions. 

I think possible someone impervious new information. holy crap. sound completely ignorant history. guess implying others racist left. looks foolish, sincerely hope adult. God relate much. nausea dry heaving mild exercise, abnormally high resting heart rate, sitting shower don’t pass heat spikes degree two randomly fucks BP. Stay strong friend, keep health priority, don’t lose hope. Even take couple steps back regards symptoms there’s always something try bring things back balance. think right. want catch it, know there's good chance I'd recover. parents would likely die spread them, considering preexisting conditions. work state fully opened, otherwise even gone grocery store person since March. vaccinated, I'd least willing make occasional run masked. UKs didn’t work either, country ALSO living restrictions. What’s point? 😂 Incorrect. poster replied referring total deaths entire duration pandemic, number cited already terms per capita. However, poor take current daily death rate topic conversation here.

Further, OP seems saying current daily death rate much greater reported. know true care enough Poland look up, numbers OP said accurate, Poland going truly biblical plague. 100% sure? Next time sweet call dad's name. responds least one parents. Really option. agree people taking seriously, 100% population fly Thanksgiving last year. Assuming 25% last year (which seems high), 12.5% population taking seriously based flights. definitely right though many people driving. fucking serious? ever heard anyone die cold? Give head shake! isn’t thing. When’s last time 250,000 Americans died flu season. won’t effective many people dont trust process contact tracing. 

It’s brilliant tool, won’t large enough user base effectively counteract spread. think like stuck abuser time can't make call help later. traditionally Mormons required year's worth food stored, like I'm saying radical. wha? would also mean comment teleported onto monitor here, comment teleported monitor there. \*?

so video chat teleportation then? came that? 

Telemedicine Shelbot, teleportation back then, teleportation now. Rather many COVID-IDIOTS think apply them.  UK says hi. Well, considering every state likely hit maximum hospital capacity sometime next week two, pretty sure shutting everything critical infrastructure nation good call.

Don't mad people asking reasonable shutdowns, mad local legislature pushing harder stimulus package. bad isn’t political sub. Like said, cheering unemployment rude unnecessary.  Yeah, definitely argument there. cardiac involvement pretty exceptional. Wish could, tried it’s impossible jobs family support close it’s undoable. That’s even working home fully. much disruption us kids, could definitely see difference compared pure learning environment. Away you. know sucks major ass? dead watching loved one choke die Hey! working home helping staying healthy hospitals. We're part problem. ""working"" home slur bullshit -- unless live alone, trying deal normal workload whole family top much fun. 

You make case healthcare workers treated poorly without shitting everyone else trying get by. Another therapist. people working getting paid like far between, know it.

My point public policy structured way put burden low paid ""essential workers"". Restaurants remaining open perfect example I'm talking about. Yet keep replying 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣 call GOP Obstruction Party? plan. goal standing truth, obstructing anything progressive. Otherwise, don’t anything (except giving tax breaks billionaires). Residential commercial treated differently. truck shipping extremely high value vaccines ain't gonna treated truck full Amazon deliveries. ""guy"" even part FMH idk talking about. That's simply valid conclusion based available facts, dangerous way thinking. Following guidelines make invulnerable disease. people follow perfectly still get sick. Less general population, still some.

Now, course likely right, someone stupid. can't jump conclusion. I'm surprised sad, see effect measures, would believe they'd necessary. Prevention Paradox real. “For wear mask defies efficacy purpose mask sends untruthful message susceptible infection transmit it. interests mask symbolically gesture...” 

Just virus “immune” temporarily, doesn’t mean next asshole chooses wear mask boat. Random people public don’t know you’re immune, mask helps prevent spreading, certainly would feel uncomfortable strangers mask on. work Sanford, dude joke company. knew shit watched happen liberal cityfolk snowflakes Spring could happen proud patriotic conservatives like me! Try another what? ..... sounds like me, verbatim. Pfizer press release line - ""There 10 severe cases COVID-19 observed trial, nine ... placebo group one BNT162b2 vaccinated group."" odd question, I'm sure think good one.

Primarily, get obliterated suffer even losses. generally reason behind unconditional surrender perspective loser. hope negotiated settlement disappears moment lost virtually chance inflicting meaningful losses enemy. Negotiated settlements possible still level power.

Japan invaded outright murdered 16,000,000 people, causing war enslaved millions women sex - many died - raped thousands more, murdered infants cold blood, engaged slave labor SEA China, experimented subjects least extent Nazi Germany further. pre-empt trying bring American crimes, yes, shit, that's we're talking about.

Japan's hopes conditional surrender included avoiding punishment war crimes, disarmament, occupation, general, consequence war itself. based fear people - based fear ruling class.

You also answer question, instead trying weasel asking Japan's motivations. United States pursued unconditional surrender Japan? Ah recommendations put basically ineffective? Idk town live basically dead now. Oh yes, know that. People falsely claimed gave arthritis despite actual evidence happening ruined everyone else. vaccine development Valneva that's works years; AFAIK they're ones working Lyme vax. guys made decision way back summer, good did.

Meanwhile NYC school’s deal Bill DeBlasio’s ego. instead working teachers, made decision return in-person schools. worked for...eight weeks. Now, again, parents, teachers students dealing fully remote learning system slapped together three days. ""as governor going put thousands work. know financial support this. decision. least know base accuse wrong doing."" Uh Vietnam lockdown lasted month half life back normal. Yeah could go restaurants clubs it.

Still waiting hear, specifically, terrible restrictions Australia :) People obviously like playing Russian roulette. imagine 9/11 general reaction outside new york ""bwaah, really problem, mostly new yorkers, none knew, cares"" that's kinda what's happening right now. Serious question, first world countries dealing unemployment bread lines? country dealing breadlines? welfare food stamps cover food costs? isn’t Federal government stepping provide? isn’t government state level stepping in?

This much, much worse Great Recession? don’t remember massive breadlines back then.

I feel bad everyone right now. I'm done you. lockdown
2) extensive track trace enforced quarantine
3) herd says essentially ""we've chosen 3"".

Because option 3 herd immunity.

It 3)allowing spread.

And none quotes proof herd immunity strategy. one actually cares long term effects. Come on, party pushing open schools rapidly without kind precautions also party actively trying destroy public education since 1980s.

When last meaningful national piece legislation affected education positive way? can't even remember. try another. lose? $4 \*for two year period\* lot you, probably frequently buying $1.39 drinks (or specifically, drink costing $1.40 instead $1.39 issue) -- can't afford that. Looking Congress. shortsighted comment. Agreed. think look back development vaccines realize achieved monumental. point people need know months away people able get need remain vigilant then. We're desperate good news, hate think people see headline great new vaccines coming, understand timing details. Death rate children COVID low. actually you’re wrong. I’m favor masks social distancing. 
In last year, parents passed away(non Covid related).
The family left 2 hours away I’m spending holiday bc covid.
So quit judgmental asshole. Get virus control, economy recover. can’t robust economy unchecked virus. “lives vs economy” ever thing makes sense me. Yeah, agree medical workers hitting limit. thinking feeling feel years road. give PTSD sad hear stories. would dead dead people cannot infect anyone. Uni­ver­si­ty Mary­land School Med­i­cine indi­cates that COVID-19 patients few­er com­pli­ca­tions took aspirin. part study, COVID-19 patients giv­en aspirin ear­ly out­pa­tient were 43% less like­ly admit­ted inten­sive care unit (ICU), 44% less like­ly put a ven­ti­la­tor and 47% less like­ly die.

The supplements zinc, iron vitamin D.

Don't go nuts iron (or others) iron much lower threshold overdose appropriate dose dependent iron levels, could take high dose anemic took normal iron status could quickly overload system iron.  think lot people become comfortable see administered people. believe people hesitant getting vaccine due rushed virus care? 

If doctor would going party work elderly parent? course not. It’s nothing class privilege.

I think think ‘virus privilege’ like didn’t deserve get infected ‘careful’ got exposed noble reasons. Wait mean? measures those?  I'm curious anti-vax crowd rails state can't control bodies feels corporations getting equipment vaccinate employees. get wrong, I'm preparation. I'm curious see they'll say. I've checked email. someone really really wants herd Immunity strategy true would read way. local shop UK started selling 'catalytic fragrance lamps' claim fragrance diffusers stop COVID! blurb poster full double talk seems deliberately written make think recommended them. Comes variety 'essential oils'.

Anyone got links science debunking take them? google results filled quack blog posts Facebook spam. blame whoever want. congratulating Washington's governor putting thousands people work surge pandemic holidays.

Well done, governor! know **not** fault all. totally decision people Washington!!! Would hate see progressive governor look bad, eh.... source? thought remembered hearing none people vaccine group severe Covid lol idk disagree here, drifted far ""Pack stores Black Friday!"" point, makes argument irrelevant criticism OP's post. Good.

Also, live one worst outbreak areas world, business largely think allowed months.

Guess what? That's exactly things bad here. I'm arguing theoreticals like are. PROVEN approach work.

Have great day bud, fun pointing errors thoughts :) Straw man argument - one saying anything like current unemployment benefits essentially made anyone making less 22-24 per hour makes sitting home.

People Reddit preach unemployment, ar least Michigan factories fast food places can’t hire people one wants work. UPS actually offering signing bonus 24 per hour, yet need stimulus. 

Nothing free, prices goods already jumping. stimulus means inflation, long term worse getting thousand dollar check. I'm understanding correctly, could mean half dose makes difference vaccine works much better younger people.

Will important see age breakdown infections normal dose group see case.

If actually turns efficacy people 55 normal dose group similar 90%, would mean efficacy older people would lower average 62%.. definitely came axe grind, facts damned. 

You're right, break numbers studies, apparently many studies yet. interview quote experts field experiencing post-Covid patients, want dive [the paper woman 40s mentioned example previous viruses similar Covid cause cognitive impairment - sounds like rather relevant fact. 

We know common rare incidents are, know long-term temporary.  That's point - there's lot know virus, risk calculation lot complicated ""If kill harmless"" subreddit could post anything positive without getting voted oblivion. then, election, disappeared. trusted source? think might happen fears another pandemic happening. Also antibiotic resistant bacteria increasingly becoming problem, vaccines would part solution deal problem. lack data outside isolated reports skeptical.

I'm opinion happened often people say, would least couple studies saying, ""XX% people found still reduced lung capacity recovering mild COVID cases."" reading study day Chinese government test 10 million people Wuhan couple weeks. 10 fucking million. Tull says herd immunity. Tegnell.

No, Tull offers three options:

1) lockdown 
2) extensive track trace enforced quarantine 
3) herd immunity

Tegnell says essentially ""we've chosen regional doctor. someone connected making Swedish strategy. 

Not quite... Infection Control Doctor - is, man responsible implementing strategy region - understanding strategy pretty damn clear ""goal = herd immunity"".

He make up. know fact behind scenes Tegnell openly talking herd immunity, seems obvious regional specialists told private match Tegnell saying public since backlash came.

Note: March Tegnell problem admitting pursuing herd immunity Saying UK seems well thought strategy early march proof herd immunity strategy. 

That's said know it. said Sweden \- similar, would like say, says.  listened British say **they say exactly Sweden.** much appealing way thinking violent ways trying put end (with countries). clear risk create even higher peaks (on spread). put dam river, hold river certain level, eventually get huge flow period. **It's better let seep slowly.** keep control take care harm society necessary. **In order Sweden achieve flock immunity, six million inhabitants would affected virus.**  Yes, time must remember vast majority become slightly ill. know big so-called dark number is, lot suggest very, big, says Anders Tegnell.  **Even sounds like lot, may one 60 percent get really sick maybe five six need care. smear five-six percent six-eight-ten-twelve months, manageable healthcare.**

In March talking ""smearing"" 6 million cases several months - that's herd immunity strategy. what? close border lockdowns don’t sync Frances. France steady increase UK decided lift restrictions flight comes France boom; another outbreak. Unless you’re syncing lockdowns, gunna work. 

And I’ve already addressed this. Chinas lockdown like draconian nightmare. East Asian countries entirely different system government western countries. heavily reliant government, militantly enforced. personal liberty privacy vs government interference philosophy happens East Asia. Culture monolith political responses either. always catered public. Bad point. Next? mean opinion covid probably reveals lot yet Sweden still pretty well comparison many European countries comes deaths per capita. everyone hit heavily right now. Sweden seem worse countries tried heavy lockdowns. know vaccine 95% efficacy rate? chance catching virus going Harvard (1 20). Also, reduce symptoms/make asymptomatic, need worry Corona vaccine.

The Vaccine always end goal, since start pandemic. Stop fearmongering. SARS-CoV-1 immune responses, although certain sterilizing immunity, shown last 11 years infection. [0] hand normal cold viruses shorter lasting immunity, challenge trials shown 60% susceptible year later, although less severe symptoms. [1] Based severity Covid-19 somewhere middle, even considering vaccines usually said provoke stronger targeted immune respons virus itself.

[0] Yeah, get that. majority people still can't postpone major holidays year, pandemic made give humanity. Almost one make sacrifices good everyone. Can't say making ton progress. Yesterday governor signed extension already place executive order, barring local governments jurisdictions anything enforce masks mandate violations 
(.i.e. collecting fines etc.) made part.

No didn't. Check email Tegnell confirms choose ***""Allow spread infection, slowly rapidly, achieve hypothetical 'herd immunity'.""*** strategy.
Remember? state herd immunity strategy? can't find source, see discussion around it. agree, image based culture like media doesnt love running fear based stories seeing footage body bags morgue trucks scare shit people stay home. isn’t really. That’s like saying Marco Rubio good looking. politicians get completely different rating system? Read full headline Obama got [great Trump screw up. It’s pretty rude cheer unemployment. think mean federal government lack national subsidies. (Edited clarity.) response trying get. Let’s assume 50k didn’t corona. add anyone dies something would diagnosed COVID times. (Impossible, know) that’s we’re really looking could well almost even. 

I’m saying let’s stop regulations. said guy, don’t necessarily agree points right now. making people think. turn brain

My family vaccinated. got flu shot already. anti-vaxxer. 

This kind messaging fucking weird triggering kinds red flags mind. testing more. positivity rate falling like would testing. 

But it:

1) head Sweden's virus response lying?

2) know lot epidemiology Sweden's specific situation him?

Well, that's rhetorical question, obvious answer wrong, bought lot propaganda, incapable admitting it. Yes agree, critical vaccine 100% safe think could visit help garden you’re wearing mask(Assuming garden outside). sais man abortion cause makes imaginary friend sad uncle Florida, says thing , ( up-voting you, someone down-voted , idea why, comment accurate!!!) garbage misinformation. Fucking Biden. lol still work well though, right? words, people take mean ""better see family gone"".

It's one giant marshmallow test. Thanksgiving right huge risk. Wait year, risk. wait year - scratch that, even. Meet vaccinated true celebration, true thanksgiving. pretty much nothing changed.. Fair enough. simply evidence far cardiac inflammation cases post-Covid post-Covid respiratory symptoms lasting months vs flu. I'm aware common memory issues post-flu, two pretty solid point. fire would impossible put out, point one country, isolated island, accomplished that. Inalienable rights inalienable rights. Americans freedom movement, association, gathering, participate interstate commerce excercise applicable rights. 

Justice Alito signaled bring cases outcomes reflective new court built. Enjoy. continue fight rights people roll over. Tak researchers University St. Andrews Scotland, looks viral load viral shedding data – help determine transmissibility – found levels peak around time first symptoms fifth day infection.

They go say diseases like SARS higher viral loads symptom onset allows people isolate themselves, likely reason COVID spread quickly. Americans clearly decided saving lifes something care base busy airports mean, analogy, top everything else said, highlight argument think okay. right decision. it’s painful, heartbreaking way die time, you’re putting people try save risk. 

(Inb4 “well signed it”: nobody signed happening. Nobody.

Upon second reading, appear one individual attended church service blood donation attended church transmitted virus to** six people households, three people group-home settings **two people attended Blenheim blood donor clinic.** :) coworker tested positive morning. can't get rapid test. fastest result find 2-4 days (e.g. 4 days). Half places called said even nearby exposure test symptoms. One place called said website wrong may take 10-14 days result (so effectively pointless). rest telling cannot guarantee insurance cover know $1034 $1300 procedure. Insurance company says cannot guarantee health service would inform me. So... Getting free drive thru test 7 day wait results. Spending holiday home. Still go work Monday symptoms America. hey, least risk giving mom Covid. mine like 20 years ago (for trip Venezuela, IIRC), got kind certificate card too, idea now. moved house several times interval, knows. ever need again, hope taking another shot already vaccinated OK.

Lol, rationalize however please. 92 year old venturing much? seems like could avoided... solution simple: people choose potentially catching/spreading deadly disease starvation, therefore government funds allocated keeping businesses afloat they're closed well people form frequent stimulus checks higher amounts money. Since vaccine close, would especially justified. that's called asymptomatic, symptoms
(lung scaring, heart inflammation etc) Aw someone panties twist. stalking now? sad I’m going check it, thank recommendation! capitalism reinforces culture super interesting. whole argument kids getting covid meaningless teachers bc stop school gatherings. positive teachers ones quarentined exposure one can't person school.

I'm trying get district focus basic skills develop plan incorporate missed curriculum next grade(s). K-5 may need repeat year. year wash trying force normal stressing kids teachers. Students showing virtual classes. Something like 25% high school failing. Social desirability bias. think take morgue trailers every town it. take different vaccine. trust BioNTek one developed Germany.

You choice several different vaccines. take Putin one want to.

My friends UAE got South Korean one ago. far good. Non medical meaning cloth masks, N95 etc. cherry picking, aren’t told wear N95s study medical grade masks aren’t relevant using cloth masks (and generally washing them, trained keep sterile fitted)

I’m anti-mask, think reasonable protection circumstances, also increase risk others. Overall net benefit minimal harm. However they’ve given miracle status rather small incremental change risk. Obvious examples like meat packing plants (where masks always worn) near 100% workers got sick weeks show lack distancing totally overwhelms protection masks offer.

You look logically. gain would pharmaceutical companies release dangerous ineffective vaccine? Literally entire world watching skepticism questioning already rampant. Releasing vaccine could dangerous would sink even largest drug company - traded publicly, stocks would sink like stone reputations would burnt crisp.

I don’t necessarily disagree comment, certainly putting favorable possible light things work. said previous comment, benefits negatives system including Japan’s. higher chance spreading go in, many going quarantine 2 weeks after.

Right walked right hospital right said ""I think Covid"", doctor would say ""Do feel symptoms?"" would say ""Not yet"", would say ""Well go home quarantine 2 weeks get worse come in"".

And would trust that.

Right?

So *that's exactly thing*. 

So allow see mother, send home quarantine, *like anybody/everybody exposed Covid might get sick*?

It makes sense all. Ironically, user always points NZ country accomplished saving lives. lives want saved. That's they're population. states believe vaccines. So, they'll storage unused getting spoiled.
Huge percentage people states(60-70%) believe vaccines.
This politics. saving lives want saved.
Again, cannot convince people take vaccine brainwashed believe conspiracy theory depopulate world. Kind pulled from. watched movie early pandemic, hit close home.

I also know people pull trucks vaccinated identification well. Forced vaccination. could’ve seen coming? RemindMe! 3 weeks watched ""the social dilemma"" Netflix yet, should. last 40 minutes documentary important. Yet see Twitter numbers posted people asking post number people dying flu. think higher government trying overplay numbers. try respond numbers get angry Please stop it. know! Benefit living close mom lol provided specific month contradicts sources, saying spring general public, need provide source claim. 

No one said anything next years. also never said anything throwing mask away; quite assumption make. 

If you’re going provide outlandish claims, need provide source. seems lazy spreads misinformation. This. people don’t follow fourteen day one, since half people get symptoms within 5 days, least catch cases, especially people it. problem right people don’t even quarantine waiting 1-2 days test results, even sure positive. Good luck that, though support it.

My place saying flu vaccine mandatory year medical religious exceptions. many people nursing staff like ""hell injecting something me"", ""nope, dont know whats vaccine"", ""nope, always makes sick"".

So already trying say religion two aides already quit it.  Inb4 mods delete comment 'misinformation ' times 16,500

La times said 20k though. seem outlier figure.

Thats big ass discrepancy. Yes. headline get:

Alabama coach Nick Saban tests positive, showing COVID-19 symptoms

He’s got symptoms time. affects ""small fraction"" participants ""very mild"" symptoms"", concern letting people know ""not going walk park""? make sense. 

And you, random internet person, say horrible symptoms covid, think makes sense believe real-life observations experiences. family friends working public throughout entire pandemic. tested positive perfectly fine, mild symptoms. weeks ago, good friend tested positive. working closely dozens people leading positive test, one person got it. husband get it. get it, hanging out, inside, maskless, sharing drinks food couple days before. headache muscle aches enjoyed mandatory two-week staycation work. 

I realize media wants us terrified thing, nothing friends' experience shows anything scared of. Eight months later, none us isolating, still even know anyone hospitalized, let alone died. 

I'll skipping vaccine sure. there’s thing called convenience travel people likely travel points convenient. Nobody taking 8 hour flight Australia day. people spend day London France. Lol vaccinated true celebration, true thanksgiving.

Due rushed distribution vaccine studying long term side effects length immunity, experts urging people wear masks social distance 2021. live Midwest state. month two ago getting test pretty easy—any employee university could get one within days every week. it’s almost impossible get; I’ve coworkers drive hour two get tested (vs driving employee health 5 minutes away) exposure.

Obviously anecdotal, think testing availability probably play role. We’re going die anyway. live fear? probably look would happened didn’t. smoke three packs day lung cancer. going get it, I'd already. Non sequitur. ""other people"" refer also freedom choose go want expose virus. one forcing go anything.
As wearing mask, American people lied started, told masks work, recommended necessary. Guess what, lie people quit trusting you. Governor Ron DeathSentence Nice them! Going excess deaths, US currently far 400K deaths predicted OP... Americans clearly morally depraved. That’s terrible. sherif caught perhaps teach lesson? I’m fan way guy dealt virus. ""yellow zones"" get tests WEEKLY.
If yellow zone, need get tested. 
My county, nassau county, said that, orders Cuomo, 9%(revised) positivity rate, schools close. Yet county closing schools almost every day ""decontaminate"". course, comparable COVID related considerations. husband tested positive we’re quarantining. family nearby they’re going drop thanksgiving dinner us. health concern. Ohhh, badass!! courageous! Encouraging people without proper testing quarantine reckless. Yeah, things called planes. People get go different countries around world. May 6 mid spring early summer. First day summer isn’t till June 20th. Headline downplaying it. [Because many politicians looks like reheated mashed bible say white horse white house? lockdowns? Sure, there’s economic argument made.

But masks? There’s literally downside wearing masks. 

This pure idiocy. Ok 1. say majority. Current governmant party (PiS) lost cities villages. PiS voters mostly elderly uneducated poeple watch lot public TV, main propaganda measure governmant. elderly people living hometown participating voting lot young people offen live different place they're scheduled vote in. would require make extra trip local office register voter, offen (I know didin't used live 300 miles hometown 10 years). Also rarely believe actually change something. add ask around see really many people supporting governmant.
2. Well yes, really know details highlight judges decided law signed \~1991 unconstitiutonal, since constitution says every human right live (or something). would mean week old fetus already human being, extention given social security number already get benefits every baby child - currently \~130€ / month parents (130€ 4x poland western europe) course that's happening.
3. mean seperete parties. coalitions match one PiS. PiS 43% support next opposition coalition 27% 2019 elections. seems excessive.

Sure, system perfect. Though indeed wait-times things (e.g. dermatologists like unicorns), everybody likes complain healthy, overall benefits outweigh negatives. Children probably last Oh, curfew applies ""non-essential"" activities. OK run 24 hour grocery store middle night. one take seriously rather pointless. mean US country problems controlling virus?!?!? mean Germans, touted beginning pandemic model mitigation strategy compliance also struggling?!?!

That's going popular sentiment around here. one people say smokers denied treatment lung cancer? bet one person would sudden important disturbing?

We know course enough vaccines everybody. might enough everybody 2021. want really get vacccine already coronavirus...And chances reinfection astronomically low keep seeing Summer 2021. goalposts move again, people stop own. many countries “did right thing” locked mask mandates lost much worse. 

Ultimately it’s winning reaching “Covid zero”, expectations cause harm good. It’s minimizing suffering society whole Sweden done better job nation. Plus HR best interest company employees hard understand sub lol.

Half people treat “wishing safe go home sad it, going anyway duh” bad going.

A lot sub deeply surprised human anything perfectly logical state based machine.

I find whole different type concerning [here's Looks like still apply Spreading suffering death unwilling unwitting anyone’s right. dogma twisted ideology. Flying never safe CDC hasn’t indicated is. Yeah it’s truly shocking ppl worried long term effects vaccine still don’t know bad effects virus itself. seen far, cardiac/neurological damage pretty extensive mild severe cases. Fuck....that  Well fact can't determine someone body. Lol avoiding question? shut borders first place?  I'm happy well enough come home! Yeah, one spot capitalism failed healthcare system. /s ""we cautions, wearing masks social distancing"", lol, sure.

Its them, Texas, culture think-believe. poorly really see wrong.

We think ""wear masks"", fact wear nose, beneath chin. think ""social distancing"", reality go crowded places, maybe 10% less crowded before. think ""careful time"", reality cheat convince count.

Truth is, virus give wiggle room, second chance, participation trophy. post saw friend mine Instagram morning. Right talk currently seems fear vaccines. actual practices amplify health wellness? 

Dear Governor

I'm small business owner fought tirelessly epidmenic.  independent restaurant, done everything possible stay afloat.  also wellness company. producing immune-boosting food community including immunity kits frontline workers. Food filled wholesome raw ingredients designed boost immune systems reduce inflammation.  government teaching citizens manage sickness play offense game sickess vs proactive defensive: Take Vitamin C, D, Garlic Pills, Zinc, NAC, Camu Camu-all amazing supplements boost immune system + eat nutrient dense foods.  me, missed opportunity teach citizens improve health, provide defense gamble and/or manage disease.  Wellness produced practiced big pharma simple practices huge benefit health. killing small businesses could teaching people kill prevent disease live happier, better quality lives simply better wellness practices. extremely small window statistics also take account actual rest world. Gotcah something normal/acceptable from?

No, suppose bit tasteless ask something like that, outside observer, honestly hard time figuring Texans could possibly proud today.

You *surging* Coronavirus cases right now, hospitals going beyond capacity everywhere, governor fuck-all it. take bit further, [compared 37th Health Care, 34th Education, 39th Opportunity, 33rd Crime &amp; Corrections 40th Natural Environment. Texas also [10th obese union. [Your literacy rate making fourth-lowest state literacy (meaning 19% adult population cannot read write properly, all, meaning 1 5 adults Texas incapable reading sentence).

There likely many statistics like these, quick google search away, finding first second result. Sure, none stats really absolute worst, fact many teetering edge top 10 (or bottom 10 rather), confused anyone would outright *proud* Texan. that's weed People free choose live. However, free choose others die. many ignorant people I'm sure aware of. trouble responding online, enough is.

It's better let us vote without response whenever look back stupid comment, see bunch downvotes responses. Bullshit. know invasion Japan going happen? beginning stages implementing invasion Japan. Read ""Operation Downfall"" clearly see Allies going ""Wait out"" Japanese conduct invasion Japan itself. Projected causalities millions.  goal herd immunity no. Thats mail says.

That's exactly says.

""Allow spread infection achieve herd immunity."" Sure, I’m what’s point? There’s running post around somewhere dozens dozens studies looking want evidence. burden proof shouldn’t 100% people making heavily supported claims. thing (even so) climate change. I'm gonna take vaccine luckily make choice quarantine good girl marathoning Hannibal. ... think maybe don’t understand scientific studies work man fuck point, can't fix anymore GOP plague rats already ignoring data. We're ffffked country. Dang, sucks. little, late. Um actually lady Walmart literally could breathe paper mask nearly fainted. Masks real virus killing people.

/s 😂 cool post without pointing country widespread transmission. guess makes easier us Covid want vaccine, get vaccine Ahh makes sense Uh definitely mdma disgusting comment really? iv getting weekly covid updates posts Atealein long time seen swedes say that. actually seen opposite. discourage prohibit political ideological grounds. young people basically destined get covid?

So obviously point vaccine A. stop vulnerable people getting first B. stop spread 50-70%ish get artificial immunity, rely artificial herd immunity percentage.

Doesn't essentially mean 'bounce' covid us get natural immunity? (for bit.) 

So young person, likely get virus? I'm actually quite scared now, ive seen three 20 year old friends healthy, fit sporty muscles waste away weeks, unable work months, hospitalised fluid lungs. know anyone whos hasnt major symptoms mid-long term effects.


Because immunity lasts little time, mean probably going high risk catching every year, seeinrg acts like seasonal flu, old/vulnerable people get vaccines first, leaving us constantly sacrifice health year year? definitely higher. lot families burying loved ones Christmas. Let’s gather round tree remember grandma little Johnny never experience another Christmas.  Probably 🧠🤏 guess surprised. I've seen (not personally course, fortunate me) frictional engineering professor buys Intelligent Design thing. also emphasize one care mechanical engineer thinks evolution, case. say anywhere ""currently"". That's problem. I'm you, want data - think still newsworthy doctors raising concerns. 

And terrified get Covid I'll end brain fog months? No. possibility seem real enough one reason keep quarantining (don't go restaurants bars, meet friends outdoor settings) ? Hell yes.

But definitely share frustration apparently papers since one - I'd love one says ""Large scale study shows risk cognition issues low"" majority journalists USA work newspapers, newspaper staff work home. Quite newspapers even sold brick mortar office pandemic. would think retail workers, teachers staff, healthcare workers staff, etc, dont luxury working home first priority.  
This article focuses visual journalists work public. even journalist organization write proper headlines. ND morning reported highest death rate. sad. know trolling read said lived house coming home hospital. gather people already live lol people would wear mask social distance, are.  I'm SC businesses still getting crushed lock downs 40%+ still going out, large events happening, business travel still hold, work home going away. 

Hopefully vaccines fix issues, long-term changes work home business travel going away. Lol, fuck will. definitely going HR people traveling downplaying everything. NYT paywall coronavirus coverage, require make free account access it. Skåne registered 971 cases today, miss spring lightly hit. Hey, covid denier issues getting vaccine it, honestly, I'll take win.  

Great job, bud! 👨‍👧 think rights, take consideration coerced giving supervisor consent right face.  Dumb! late!

When grown adults throw temper tantrum something simple mask going next impossible.

How many anti-maskers also anti-vaxx'ers? wear mask get vaccinated.

Sociologists etc. going writing much well collectivist cultures badly individualist cultures (especially US). rooms tend incredibly cramped. 2 3 lived in, could room exercise. lockdown small county live south SF Bay since May. Everyone wears masks stores locals gather regularly family events parties. Outside dining socializing allowed. well summer even got open indoor dining gyms reduced occupancy awhile. However, cases started going weeks ago we're back restrictive tier curfew many people adhere to. Indoor dining gyms closed hair salons, etc., still open. fool. expecting problems? interesting first COVID-19 autopsy series appeared early April, that, understanding cardiovascular pathology based upon clinical radiological findings. reports indicated frequent cases myocarditis, even fulminant myocarditis [30,31].  postmortem examinations began occur, strong desire pathologists validate clinical finding declare inflammation myocarditis.  perhaps fortunately, case myocarditis occurring expected high frequency, primary secondary cardiovascular injuries seem likely culprits.  descriptions insignificant inflammation “myocarditis” across autopsies may attempt satisfy expectation disease, rather represent true viral myocarditis extent cause real cardiac injury death. sound like are, per buddy industry there. 100% agree, let’s get frontline medical workers first, move elderly children next (my grandma retirement home hasn’t left 9 months, becoming severely depressed). acknowledge work home, generally healthy low risk severe complications cool chilling back line. Yes understand impact socially highest risk riskiest spreaders need anything.

And one nursing friends told us hospital outbreak among nurses :( Larger companies typically large on-site clinics use flu shots, example. fit narrative. ways reduce risk take responsibility others pandemic lie ""locking UV-irradiated lead closet coated hand sanitizer"" ""attending woodstock fever"". 

People, general, comfortable nuance. less people get tested, virus spreads more. Then, people die. Pretty simple maths actually. would guess different genetic groups vary illness severity immune response. claimed take 14 day course one point. sure promote drug. nobody wore masks covid. people wore masks decrease covid. nearly everyone wears masks still much covid more. 100% people wear masks still covid. Don’t people get it? Masks don’t work, never airborne flu. Ffs. Don’t blaming people less programmed don’t call cops someone wearing mask, it’s ridiculous. Using logic wear masks forever safe. Fuck.

Phew, glad see talk employer mandates vaccines overblown. 100% already dead. Fair enough. Since PHD field first line go ahead get first wave let rest us watch wait. Spray paints work -50⁰C temps. Bricks however... never going free, they're businesses. care pays them, government paying negotiate lower price can't. don’t need smart nurse- know plenty dumb people high school ended nurses Healthcare country fucked none us appreciate preaching us like paying test government literally abandoned us, things bad. difference us successful countries leadership. Good leaders know humans groups dumb force necessary behavioral changes save herd, like federal mask mandate. fuck states rights pandemic. lack national response quarter million us dead already.

Fuck stop justifying companies charging us. Corporations fund whole thing. Fuck Elon Musk make rich ass pay it. Taxes Jeff Bezos alone would pay much more.

Stop eating lies you’ve spoon fed employers. It’s fucked pass buck onto population got $1,200 last year. got $400ish made hair $80k last year disqualified full amount, even though lost job unemployed since March. *cries uninsured*   True, still costs store transport. Covid vaccines gonna gonna quite bit popular insulin. may need fridge space store it, currently have. mention moved refrigerated trucks shipping containers. infrastructure easily handle modified handle it, shelf stable far better, worry spend less get customers. I've seen people from, frankly, random areas US 9/11 like ""yeah thought next."" Relatively people understand sheer horror 9/11 felt witnessed NYC area, DC area - basically parts Northeast - saw responded crash PA, yet hits every American *so hard* every inch country attacked. COVID, though, remarkably different, terrorist. Even though widespread deadly 9/11 attacks were. course places. them, business usual. places always demand expected. I'm concerned that. Yumyum part Arkansas lot chicken processing plants. wonder that's what's driving spread there. They're onboard herd immunity, obviously. Holy lord. That's great news. Fauci saying April, CDC director saying March. real strong logic got welfare, get everything need handed you.

~A person knows nothing welfare.... didn’t say anything “troubles happening”. I’m sure you’re referencing ? Literally every single American lockdown protest ever. Look masks. again, issue mainly standardized curriculum. don’t think exam pass result determines quality nurse. Looking online, NCLEX seem like hard test, it’s moreover matter cramming material understanding it.

It’s test, simple that. Curriculum, material courses taught, hand standardized. hear often gaps clinical knowledge nurses, perhaps covered exam. 

That’s ultimately fine, problem expectations autonomy nurses admin rise nursing curriculum stays same. That’s get medical errors points malpractice. Viruses living non-living highly disputed amongst microbiologists.

What happens workers feeling side effects unable come work help Covid patients? 

What mess top messes. :(  really. It’s widespread enough people unable ignore it. I’m talking it’s longer refutable even craziest crazies: type don’t believe shit happens them.

History prove religion ground colonization western world needed making form policy decisions whatsoever centuries later. Understood. USA sick man world.   think theory United States many internal Islamic terror attacks United States better culturally accepting immigrants, Europe worse? 

Or maybe Europe plain many muslim immigrants? maybe colonial history muslims United States have? 

The United States many terror attacks country elected Trump militarily involved middle east make sense. know though? Thanksgiving year wife 3 year old laws. laws retired don’t leave house. wife work home 3 yr old don’t go anywhere either. How’s 50% chance? mean, guess believe seems unreasonably high Well stated. forget core base, elderly. Many good people age related cognitive decline also come time could take people word makes easy pickings modern age. also get peer pressure good people retire move communities couple cultists working nonstop indoctrinate others day free now. makes sense. waste time getting tested symptoms exposed?

Seems like waste money own. know nurse flying home hotspot another hotspot Thanksgiving share news story this? Earliest detected covid Italy. Coming Soon: High School students devise ultra-cold freezers vaccines common parts, put plans online. n95 masks trap moisture pretty well. nice dry winter. Everyone hates big pharma suddenly need big pharma. won’t covid positive. won’t actual virus. no, can’t spread it. wouldn’t worry like wouldn’t worry getting flu someone got flu shot. research painting super spreaders small intimate gatherings main cause. expect case rates double Thanksgiving. me, I'm year. evidence suggest working intended authorities

What fuck talking about? numerous studies show effective. Ignoring evidence make right. people like cause us fucking lockdown still.

Directly CDC. know you, studies confirmed benefit universal masking community level analyses: unified hospital system,  German city, U.S. state, panel 15 U.S. states Washington, D.C., well Canada U.S. nationally. analysis demonstrated that, following directives organizational political leadership universal masking, new infections fell significantly. Two studies additional analysis data 200 countries included U.S. also demonstrated reductions mortality. economic analysis using U.S. data found that, given effects, increasing universal masking 15% could prevent need lockdowns reduce associated losses $1 trillion 5% gross domestic product.

Wait, “considering”? What’s magic number looking comes cases?
Cuz pretty good idea Holiday weekend get number. Money. Whoever ready most, soonest make money. corporations accountable stockholders. feel nursing degrees general sense tell basics. Like stop bleeding, change bedding, administer drugs, etc. seem skip actual science part behind medicine go taking care patients. 

Majority family nurses seem complex them. feel superior medical issues point science thing dismiss it.

Like masks thing, airflow avoid Covid-19 lingering air, general societal distancing etc.

Had many arguments family nurses masks that. Mentioned people open windows turn fan wear masks. Response ""if increase airflow spread virus faster!""... Hence open windows use fans avoid air circulating. Dang, Washington used sit 70's longest time, Oregon 60's Idaho 100-200 range. 210, 294, 752 respectively. F Alabama? tell? Exactly. War Terror legitimately created ISIS, kept check. MuH FrEeZe SpEecH!

What’s fucked government isn’t funding anymore ongoing issues middle east, rise ISIS, spread violent religious philosophy happened happening now.

Many conditions **worsened** flat-out **created** (ISIS) War Terror. 30 days later we're purple tier like entire state. Still relatively well, suppose Lol I've already switched stores require masks, law magically make everybody comply. 

Also states anti-mask laws suspended health orders, health orders expire they'll illegal wear. considering bans exist allow arresting black bloc, doubt they'll go away even covid. really bad, last 4 days Italy's death toll US equivalent numbers: 11/21 692 deaths(3,806), 11/22 562(3,091), 11/23 630(3,465) today 853(4,691)---Only Hungary Belgium higher death tolls per capita basis last 4 days spite proven wrong over. Yet, still let facts impede fantasies. Yeah think that, anti-vax dance. That’s getting virus several people know. Even possibly prion diseases? 

And I'm totally asking want make OK eat human meat, would even think that? can't afford $5-15k freezer really use again.

A single Covid hospitalization costs this, understand math. Exactly. people choose responsible/cautious aren’t going suddenly throw window small portion high priority people vaccinated. Likewise, people choose ignore simple health recommendations aren’t going feel need vaccine all, least won’t change lifestyle then. people don’t get reasons. much longer though bet. many people think immune CDC recommendation multiple household Thanksgiving celebrations. Makes sacrifices I’ve made since start pandemic feel completely useless. Speaking someone living NYC beginning year - screamed rooftops. anyone dug hole buried heads sand - zero sympathy point. think math checks one. Even die, sucks virus. awful, even 20 year Olds. probably true masks better others COVID protection, mask better none (excepting novelty &amp; lace crap).

Working COVID patients indoors different risk walking street. Hell yeah would want N95, face shield, full Tyvek hazmat suit COVID ward.

Note: IANAD, opinions own. Oh okay bad tried seem work maybe it’s accurate way. least warmer weather vitamin exposure keeping Florida somewhat Check Though lately local news getting worse every day medical staff treat grandma. anyone else Thanksgiving dinner.

And like got COVID either die fine. look COVID long haulers. And, know long-term effects COVID-19 be. get shingles senior got chicken pox kid. get dementia HIV positive. know percentage population going prone heart disease, kidney disease Parkinson's disease contracted COVID. know. yellow vaccination booklet get many countries. family 3 covid positives moment 100% Thanksgiving. I've expressed concern think I'm lunatic ""cant hide forever""

I'm rattled point. Get Christmas gifts drop off. near them!! Hold onto butts... Saying two separate things idea cant take year set even small amount production. Even enough healthcare workers wait rest come elsewhere. totally understand elderly hard time dealing much time left existence. either let live freely take high risks force complete isolation. Totally sucks. revisionist. Vaccination desired endgame beginning, clear enough virus nothing laugh at. Flattening curve, giving hospitals break mid-game goal, survive, remember? Everyone knew people can't live total lockdown forever, obviously game changer. OK tried post separate post....  Makes want scream throw things TV watching news ""medical expert"" saying shit like ""There thing safe vaccine....""  Well doofus thing safe case covide either.  

WTF matter people?  would saying shit like that?  guess know lied masks, saying stuff network news? County 25 people chance . 9997 one positive. That’s crazy. person know died Filipino (but nurse). Age 49 fairly healthy. Yeah, also see lot private businesses taking policies like liability reasons. Like see there's inevitably going kind case anti-vax moron spreads COVID someone else, let's say flight something, one infected people sues airline negligence medical bills take enough reasonable precautions regard COVID.

Whether would actually case begin with, sure maybe not, whether policy vaccinated people actually really foolproof really matter. least makes things easier airline point policy say safety policy place person came board infected people breaching policy - e.g. lied vaccinated weren't, etc. Good close! long ass haul. little sister lawyer, remember dragging ass last year. brutal. However, amazing fascinating career. 

Covid sucks. Student loans suck too. dammit, nearly there!! Happy you. get vote for... Pltr sonn guys yellow vaccine booklets? mean else guys remember shots got travel certain countries like Afrika South America? wish would.   think that's hand... worry guys. American flag scarf face almost filtration save me! True, although big holes, egregious people take masks eating bars restaurants (still open parts Spain) private gatherings.

I suppose masks could stop pandemic really used time around people live with, exceptions. Probably gonna happen Western country, though. talking model – model wearing mask, Zoom hangout.

Not that, money pre-ordering used expand capacity. Canada came 3 months later, need expand capacity, affect timeline we'd get it. 3+ months, almost everyone else vaccines.

This implies right. 40 million vaccines December go 40 million different people, 60 million vaccines January (or whatever), go 40 million additional 20 first shots.

Basically, one reporters specifically asked it, that's way read answer. interested, try see there's stream up, cause kinda cool exact question answered.  Lol guys really like fear monger everything - even fucking vaccine. way run cruise safely exclusively allow people recovered COVID enter. There's 15 million US alone that's based PCR tests. mom Wisconsin nursing home. pretty much stay cooped room. Every week find another staff member tested positive Covid-19.

Once staff leaves premises, free conduct way choose to. Even staff member take highest precautions, live people — roommates, family, spouses — would also regulate behavior highest standards avoid passing person takes care elderly vulnerable.

Getting many Wisconsinites responsible thing uphill battle. lost dad earlier year (not Covid-19), hope lose mom too. I’m trying save people comment people needing work  definitely. Especially hot markets. Today doctor mentioned 300 million doses one already manufactured, distribution waiting approval.  Even so, yes, immunizing entire population take while. Federal funding extended it'll continue free now.

If actually want dialogue need lay instead using strawman arguments.

Your call want taken seriously really need work make case want anybody care say, seems like whole point writing anything. idea trying get at.

It's simple common sense dining closed down. Take / curbside / delivery one thing, public activity conducted wearing respiratory protect permitted time.

It truly simple. Nothing it. common sense. actually know stand issue mandatory vaccination, one thing know that, design something relies absolutely everyone involved voluntarily choosing right thing times immediately fall apart people choose right thing - success basically relies entirely honour system - system inevitably doomed fail. doesn't. Fauci even admitted it, forgotten.

It likely one actually permanently immune covid. Unfortunately misinformation like allowed thrive.

The link explain reinfection risk covid, including vaccine.  experience today - ny - indication, really bad. People completely lost concept distancing. Every store heard someone coughing heavily (of course, could respiratory illnesses).

Instead giving people privacy, witness dying moments people can't save. 

And couple deaths, massive amounts deaths. lot nurses going need PTSD help. Mandating vaccines going make anti-vaxxers angry, better option would pay everyone gets vaccine another stimulus check, way people don’t starve death vaccine gets rolled quickly. bridge Brooklyn anyone think's government going accomplish without f--king up. realize people desperate return life knew March 2020 reality vaccination process going huge clusterbeep.

I'm hoping nothing else, younger people learn mistakes. tragic. Sorry people get satire... vaccine approved tomorrow still need manufactured, transported, distributed, administered. Think many people US. effective vaccine reason hope, finish line. probably. always going *those* people. 

However don’t see organising protests airport body scanners thousands people. pandemic!

Becadue healthcare workers told SHIT getting vaccine here. make like nothing, like Car companies canada. Great. prevent 80k infections, half single day. Good And, unaware, saline literally slightly salty water. That's it. Exactly feel. think two vaccines also showing data indicating get Covid vaccinated, symptoms also greatly reduced significantly less chance getting hospitalized. likely get regular flu-like symptoms less chance serious long-term health consequences...ie. bloot clots, lung scarring, cognitive problems, etc. showed data yet...but would huge would make feel whole lot safer. stopped wear free cases everyone still carries around anyway. Health Department says one guests spent time hospital since recovered. 

No deaths one person required brief hospital visit. spreading misinformation. Get shit together. interesting see next seasons covid-19 still covered vaccination.

Tootie Smith, will start term as chairwoman Clackamas Board County Commissioners January, posted following Facebook Saturday: “My family celebrate Thanksgiving dinner many family friends find. Gov Brown WRONG order otherwise.”

Tootie doin much toot! Ahh got it. Thanks! Well, Singapore shut borders travel (transit included) trade kept flowing (especially Malaysia). UK adopted similar strategy? Ups hubs garbage treat people packages like shit.

Are aware FDA publishes ""packaging insert"" medications vaccines includes pertinent information consumer intended read? aware many, many, many people various medical conditions contra-indicated particular vaccines particular times? Simplest example pregnant women live vaccines, instance.

Are aware FDA advise ""all"" people get ""all"" vaccines? ""medical establishment"" (which, btw, hell that? aware diverse views therein are?

Are aware vaccines carry risks? However small, actually kind important aware keep track this? instance, small number people egg allergies avoid certain types. small number people susceptible GBS, etc.

In sum, saying things way, way, way paygrade I'd advise learn bit understand world quite bit diverse complicated seem understand.

Having said support vaccines (including likely soon forthcoming COVID vax) get them, basically targeted harassment suggest get vaccinated. nEvEr MiLlIoN dEaD pEoPlE oNe YeAr hope kid gets adopted loving wealthy parents considerate pandemic. brothers marriage fails.

But holidays basically shake box hosts mixed together maximize infection across country. I've basically heard outdoors almost 100% safe particles travel around wont enough infect. Large corporations, governments, political parties etc. template follow various issues.

* Stage 1: Deny problem exists.
* Stage 2: Deny responsibility.

That's actually old school way, call ""the pitbull defense."" new way much de-centralized, throw everything wall / bury truth mountain lies Russians experts at. strategy attempts dismantle idea objective, verifiable set fear too. Vaccines aren’t cures, though many people treat one. might let guard completely think healthcare workers vulnerable protected now. still logistics, virus spreaders faster vaccinations distributed. politicians convinced Covid hoax try prevent companies requiring vaccine. bet money Republican led state legislatures pass laws granting vaccine exemptions religious grounds loopholes large blue whale could fit through. Check /u/goofygrrrl say.  vaccines aren’t 100% effective aren’t going know sure you’re actually protected not. mother hung today told it’s unsafe right drive 8 hours spend thanksgiving family. It’s heartbreaking can’t fathom idea contributing death someone else. Peak reddit comment nobody takes board seriously. Severe headaches. Fever, body pains.

But generally lasting days. Oh, you’ve concert recently without mask? sporting event without mask? schools open one wearing masks, say true? types people would disregard Coronavirus unless told it’s actively spread Islamic terrorists (as suggested parent comment) going overlap types people murder minorities perceive Muslim (multiple mass shooter events, misdirected Sikhs, give indication that). called panic porn. Y'all killing me!! I'm LMAOOO!! 😂😂😂😂 Apologies, take back.

Just narrow-minded Americans think problem way pandemic allowed wreck havoc, throw hissy fit nations who've handled better come stronger.

That group. Getting hit truck seems like uncomfortable unnecessary dinner ever holiday never really liked first place? That's nurses generally trained. ever gone fishing cast line again. start get feeling you’re catching anything day. sudden. feel first little tug line. feeling. Knowing got one. That’s great feeling dude Like you’ve never misspelled word life Yeah, family disappointed I'm going attending. state 1 40 people expected actively contagious virus. parents near 80 years old would intergenerational gathering three different counties across state.

A tipping point live four stories large apartment building, estimate 100 people sharing small elevator two stairwells. Mask usage ""ok"" 70% people hallways elevator pet friendly apartment therefore high traffic hallways elevator people taking dogs walk couple times day addition picking mail/packages, going work, store, etc.

I also live 1/2 mile hospital common encounter doctors/nurses scrubs way apartment. idea whether work COVID patients.

It's worth risk. retail stores can’t even enforce mask mandates. You’re dreaming think they’re going checking people vaccinated. pig heads could frozen item then. Oh maybe pig head staple food majority poor way politicize blame. shooting, happens every day tens thousands more.

What Federal Government done this? state governments done immediately apply penalties leave rest us cycle? tried drooling? need take care first. absolutely. getting around hydroxychloroquine hoax, different thing? make good point.

I wonder lead thanksgiving causes bit drop due reductions travel weeks prior also maybe selfish stupid people getting tested interrupt holiday plans.

There evidence lot original outbreak Wuhan, people even knowingly taking medicine avoid showing symptoms travelling. Fantastic vaccine even tested children yet major trials, agree Tennessee Wow not? invest freezer manufacturers boiiiiiis!!!!!!! Shut go back mommy's basement. like cosy little wrap. Beginning wonder sort sensory processing quirk, calming, feeling warmth breath. Covid-19 deadly, importantly, far contagious, easier transmit thanks longer incubation period asymptomatic spread, population inoculation it. 

We shut economy anytime equal number deaths occurs due something else danger covid-19 lies fast spreads. 300 car crash deaths necessitate businesses shutting businesses open result exponential car crash deaths increase. people even voted, let alone voted informed intent. They’ve chosen money, Israel USA Palestine’s dignity. results radically contradict told hydroxychloroquine's ineffectiveness. make it? Yeah things bad states it’s like European countries fine dandy. Weve told little longer long impossible believe. Ooooohhhh Kentucky. KrayKray....Kray-z. it, EXACTLY. Racism xenophobia ""justified"" 9/11. COVID? COVID needs kind decent horrible conspiracy theorizing asshat. American beg group us together don't. nothing say. course. Play game outgoing POTUS. know works. failure. you.  think end world something? course life go back normal. suck. really truly suck. 

I honestly don’t get people hate masks much. wear one day every day work don’t even notice anymore. Yeah hang around like minded people also don’t like crowded areas. There’s millions people world wide love go events, shows, games, concerts etc. sub fucking ridiculous. wearing mask every time go entire life? not, definition you’re plague spreading mass murderer. Still here. love it. still can't taste hot foods. ruined Popeyes Spicy Chicken me. 😭  Salty tastes salty, sugar ok buffalo wings bland.  8.5 months out. problems point someone seeks real taco trucks, sucks. sad chef! Guys don’t wear masks forever you’re literally worse anti-vaxxers

You literally though. think spreading flu wearing mask better someone spreading measles vaccinating? I'd love hear reasoning. bullshit Hydroxychloroquine. piece quack doctor said he's healed thousand people it. Obviously bullshit.

[Here's info way accelerate even more? Dump money allow hire people, whatever takes Hm. think deep state lizard people came plan? maybe lizard people deep state? contacted frozen pig head North America tested positive. 

It certainly possible get Covid frozen food probablity relatively low. Considering volume food import strict international travel quarantine rules, frozen food's becommen major source new cases.  am. see see news. But, understand ok many people. know answer, dont care. But, can't comprehend it. cant wear medically designed mask...? anything, mask mandate isnt go away years. like Tx selfish Governor DeSantis trumps ass like Abbott Tx much protect ppl . knew along covid really bad &amp; yet let ppl stay wrking &amp; partying &amp; ya'll .
Just like Tx men deplorable.
 Keep voting heartless dont give damn Republicans. said summer surge, receded within time. time vaccine we're banking next months, people already loosening things far gatherings, can't mandated anyway Maybe due collapse. Hopefully eye-opening, educational year people. Time tell. well good hear. think misspelled politicians, Goldman Sachs employees, professional athletes truth truth truth. taste it.

Edit. Also replying. substance. hard argue deep know saying horse shit. 

so natural defence mechanism trying now. Fair enough 😀 covid definitely spread protests regardless media say it. ""traveling"" like put en masse thought half gallon mayonnaise made nauseous.

Trump sucks, Warp Speed sure looks like success. Sorry point view protective something that's killing thousands. need wake up.

The US example, fact WORST example entire WORLD right now. defend it. Fix it.

People dropping dead people warped view like yours. joke. Wake up. planet would ever think interest real conversation someone says good person. love country, self centered.  correct, idiotic hive can’t understand it’s correct legend smith think last major serious vaccination effort done United States world matter magnitude. Flu shots even compare, decent comparison, despite time think biggest hope leads vaccines diseases currently vaccines for. Honestly guys what’s point 200 articles week like this?

We know. Everyone knows. anti maskers know. 

People either care don’t point. 

Between 100th scientific article hydroxychloroquine effective matter little point. worked scientists destroyed canadian scientific future break through. remembered worst canadian president science unfriendly. old friend seen years town Thanksgiving. released prison month ago, tested positive covid shortly released. I'd like spend time coming town I'd like know odds reinfection. wrong think covid 3 months ago odds reinfection slim? Common Asia. Heck even common temporary foreign farm workers Canada. What's crazy one Trumps remaining outlets. 
He's narcissist, support get probably feeds ego way. 


If got point, outlets ""accepted"" me, essentially propaganda, even want kind attention. mean get saying understand government “pays for” nothing, people pay taxes taxes “pay for” things. you’re paying one way another. news smart understanding people travel, equip right info minimize risk. Reddit simultaneously calling massive tech companies corporate overlords also saying people arbiters free speech. 

I don’t understand evil people regulating people see internet. Dang mixed testing numbers positive numbers. 


Regardless, many epidemiologists seem agree saying we're missing 1/5 cases reasonable assumption. assuming we're catching 1/5 cases day, yeah, would take .1% (slightly more) population positive reach number. case *worst* counties (and article says to). word “literal” overused often used inappropriately used clickbait headline. It’s 28 new deaths, 280. really freaked second.  dont thank troops service. job like other. People sign health benefits, citizenship, steady paycheck, gi bill, ect. 

It honorable thing certain situations, people getting something service.

I thank anti war anti war machine. voting shit every chance have. Young Turks. 

I’m fan TYT, size operation akin OANN. he’s confident, go ahead make available frontline medical workers consenting elderly today? Making available lower-risk demographics wait FDA meeting since supply still building.

How much analysis they’re going could done study ongoing? know three weeks lightspeed approval process, it’s absolutely valid ask need take three weeks right we’re hitting worst part yet. swear, keep reading articles that. Good luck getting vaccinated people wear masks. Czechoslovakia? Till got bored masks anyways. Combine them. ""I think Aunt Sally, kitchen, slight cough!"". ""No sure Uncle Pete guest room fever!""

Could call Cluvid.

Joke aside, I'm glad never plans see anyone. We're holed yet two weeks due another husband's co-workers testing positive. could case statistic planned visit. prevent killing people flu new strain Covid. do. Corporations “institutions” got US fucking nightmare administrations failed response easy defeat virus.  NY/NJ highest deaths per capita. Even excluding excess deaths thanks sending people back care homes. Oy vey. Projection funny thing, isn’t it? “sheep.” ""Yee-haw buckaroo! - let's saddle get Ikea pronto, Tonto!""

If nothing, nothing gets better. There’s lot crap stories like one. bad journalism across board. worry going case far many states next months. 

We're point could really hunker ride several vaccines sight. instead we're doubling trying ride thing till wheels fall Yep. That’s roll US apparently. governor might well cram people together “Corona camps” call Fuher wonder hospitalizations deaths lower week might people holding testing/treatment dont want 'ruin holiday'. figure someone willing downplay virus, may also willing pretend dont cough see grandma. Look positivity rate, numbskull. 40% means room error One Chinese poster Westerner reading:

Many principles measures China used virus predate modern states ideologies. represent experience humanity accumulated throughout many centuries. However, constant demonization governments media outlets us led measures becoming politicized averted needed it, eventually leading tragic situation right now.

With level general hostility Western world China, China's interest West remain denial China's success avert similar measures. all, disbelief harming us, Covid-19 transmit 5G part internet matter, already high alert virus imported goods. China's success fighting virus brought up, basic human sympathy want something similar, anything, protect loved ones, eventually enjoy result victory virus like right now. Many us given realized countries really glass houses, information cocoons, echo chambers number similar descriptions routinely give us. us given us despite realizations.

Drop delusion, stop politicizing medical science, save yourselves. expect major change happen though. idea - super different SARS-CoV-1.

But SARS-CoV-2 went full global pandemic unlike SARS-CoV-1 ended petering out, we're seeing lot data time around lot pre-existing conditions mixing in. Holy shit disabled SSI too? Really nuts we've bumped like this! 

My grandma's several hours away car therapist working entirely phone due COVID, I'm going outdoor walks around part town live. 

What help grandma with? one entering clinical trials Nov 2019, think Zika. remember company.

But effort converted corona. herd immunity, countries first. Sweden current 45th case per million, many European countries. Kinda remarkable. states got lot Cares Act money support businesses. Vermont almost every business able receive grant make whole months March-September compared 2019 income, grant cap $300,000. small business make side grant support. extremely low interest rates, increased ability socially isolate, substantially greater work home opportunities incentives? Cool, start go along every failed youtube competition. sure members Parler, would agree you. Yeah definitely like flu. thought would fine got I'm 20 reasonably healthy, weeks I've tested negative still lingering headache well breathing heart issues present pre covid. Frankly still know much covid simply saying like flu might true people, far many people already died virus experiencing long term symptoms end sight much like myself. makes sense. assume 20% high priority groups access earlier vaccination, March May enough time vaccinate 50% US. already give 45% population flu vaccine course couple months every year. realize vaccination two shots, I've seen community, pharmacists, nurses, medical assistants routinely give vaccines could conceivably handle double volume. study trash. get past dumb ass question. sentence structure pissed stupidity made want smoke crack. Try Chinese Medicine. Well documented history treating kinds epidemics side effects. People deny moon landing happened earth round spite mountain evidence proving both. think won’t claim footage people dying COVID fake liberal hoax?

There’s literally point try prove anything actual evidence. There’s frighteningly large population won’t believe amount facts evidence put front they’re incapable admitting they’re wrong. Well enough 50 million people Spring

This one logical say early considering front-running vaccines made way ahead time approval relative view ""quickly"" track medical reality ""quick"" is. Four months quick we're talking global vaccination effort. got really good deal
/s know still base, interesting watch Fox News coming years.

Trump steering people toward OANN Newsmax (?) away Fox. Obviously, centrists leftists *not* interested Fox, expect change. I'm curious network's future like. 

That said, definitely upsetting see trend toward fringe ""networks"". despise Hannity Carlson, even lodged far Trump's ass hosts seem be... title belongs r/makemesuffer.

Caps punctuation, Jesus. ""alternative classy"" Jesus, America lot getting worse Well, say that, but...uh...life finds way... whole movie life imitating art, smaller death toll. Yes, do, OANN, deal bullshit. hearing cure OANN YouTube, bullshit, see stupid sounds.  You’re welcome! xD It’s good phrase, haha! watch dude saying it'll February, lol! get twisted indeed great fucking news. I'm proud American

Where least know I'll die

Of something easily preventable

Because lobbyists' lie fuckers come Portland avoid paying sales tax too. months ago honestly don’t recall think could go messages check? 

Probably “Fuck Donald Trump” something like that... 🤪 get obviously topic conversation attempt drag things politics can't argue fact? do. 

That's Im simp got shot mask. 

LMFAO Bleach? I’m certain it’s good news? Yes. thought supposed 95%? Oh well, standards lowered people might decide wear masks. 1,300 nursing homes across U.S. reported three confirmed Covid-19 cases first week November — highest number ever reported single week, according NBC News analysis federal data. figure include outbreaks assisted living facilities, federal government track. Yes, let Anti-Vaxxers claim dangerous ineffective since moment anyone even suggested trying make vaccine Covid-19.


No need give anyone update time time, counter Anti-Vaxxers garbage. Gay sex vaccines kind long term side effects. negative side effects always found within months, like 5 years later. That's literally vaccines work.
  
Obviously, 'impossible' happen ever, clinical trials exist first place Couple reasons

1. OANN
2. Everyone knows there's 'cure', would big fucking news.

I definitively say 1000% certainty whatever proposed complete utter bullshit. Yeah sure OANN scientists discovered cure covid19. See dumb sounds? ever confirm vaccination antibody test? I’ve seen several patients clinic post-COVID syndrome. One guy completely normal work severe dyspnea.

We idea works long-term likely won’t know long time. One worst feelings tell patient “I don’t know do.” irony people spend Thanksgiving together, possible might spend last Christmas home together well certainly enough ICU beds take care everyone need disaster making. Hope everyone started assembling ICU facility living room now. Anxiety heightened awareness believe , seldom surprised bar fight erupts around me, examined million possibilities within first sips bacardi &amp; coke, thus moved better spot away mayhem. Biden gonna deport illegal butt back third world shit hole ""restrictions"" still extremely light usually even ""restrictions"" instead ""we recommend this""

Also, ""restrictions"" coming Tegnell. actually throwing shade government lately basically overreacting. 70% May essentially end pandemic 95% effectiveness? people leave radical group, remain shift group radical. became respiratory therapist wasn’t “finishing schooling nursing”. They’re two different degrees completely different jobs. IDK, pre meditated felonious assault could get guns taken away. That's probably worse death him. think right way view comparison. 60-70 years passed, experiencing today never happened therefore constitutes “fast”, can’t determined past events. Serious question. 

What difference going cruise forced work large office building? Oh fuck off. woman tells take mask you’re really insulted it, ignore walk away like adult. people go crazy try assault people fucking psychos. 

“trying govern people do.”

LOL. Give fucking break, asked someone put fucking mask on. Grow fuck up. got you, friend 😊 everything except imminent life threat sometimes even then. actually fresh take heard before, think makes lot sense. Although I'm sure accurate really is, appreciate new angle think lol like action thriller movie, right climax main character, girlfriend, suddenly becomes suicidal. remember April reddit phds told everyone Sweden would emerge winner end year would flocks grateful tourists visitors going open virus free country. Stupid question, big seafood freezers supposedly go like -60 turned way cold?

Couldn't put foam cooler dry ice, vaccine, dry ice top -60 seafood freezer help slow sublimation dry ice?

Its like need store weeks weeks. Ship enough vaccinate critical workers area, vaccinate day course week two, along plant workers.

Ship another chunk vaccine couple weeks second dose. peoples decisions harm loved ones bet ass I’m going speak up. woman message targeted right this, not. Idiocy everywhere, including keyboard. week half 50 100 dollars? mean 500 1000 right? forgot zero end twice.. Lol sucks. Get knees move seat way back try come bottom .  Canada deal CanSino vaccine (it's literally Canada China coproduction) fell China actually start trials Canada?

Publish shit every platform host it. gets pulled down, post again. chances kill actually pretty good get severe case, wishes regarding life support mechanical ventilation documented file. changes behavior even one person, okay that's ends. read comment properly, I? extra bodies mean, homie? That's bad one stunning indictments western society's primary values.

I'm honestly tired hearing ""people tired covid"" see happens people protect others. reap sow guess. Wait, mean like extra dead bodies straight confused hell me. Idk people nursing degree definitely skip science stuff. entire semester class research evidence based practice (plus built every single class), one pharmacology- mention A&amp;P 1 2, plus microbiology.

It doesn’t take degree administer medication stop bleeding. understand meds you’re giving you’re giving them, you’re giving for, could go wrong give them. BAck work, serfs Idk man get it. mine husband's families normal Thanksgiving shindig. Makes sad worried. Someone family get sick. hope die. Neither one fit. crack like inch best. week? Seems like pretty slap-on-the-wrist punishment something could put people's lives risk... Yes, happy loved ones died painfully slowly, also happy people recover.

These passive individuals believe God's plan, cope tragedy claiming that's God wants. unnerving deal with, put lightly. potentially millions dead nothing done, responsibility take risk greater good. ""Findings  This decision analytical model found missed instruction 2020 could associated estimated 5.53 million years life lost. loss life expectancy likely greater would observed leaving primary schools open led expansion first wave pandemic.""

Do people even believe fuck shit. laughed loud. entire let's open everything rhetoric ""studies"" push narrative strangely become comical me. prepping laughs idiotic responses I'm going get comment. Let get wine first. Here's thing: usually consistently get 50-70 deaths. Yesterday 6 reported, day that, 0. inclined think backlog issue, sudden spike Sorry misread it. sadly keep mouth shut public. never know go off.  I'm banned myself. still like reading threads, though. Things getting WEIRD quick there. Moreso normal, even.

What comment? think NYE spike gonna big.

People fucking lonely they're stretching rules allow hang family. One main problems Mexico ""free"" testing virtually impossible get, hospital bed die MAYBE get it, want one pay $50-$100 private clinic (about week half minimum wage btw). government definitely pay massive testing everywhere world looks quite good, testing volume steady. Hope continues. fuck? (6) pregnant women higher risk severe complications due covid. Well still 100,000 extra bodies US alone time. Wear mask asshole. 250K dead control pandemic. Go away. go work go home, comes groceries necessities delivered house it’s fucking batshit insane lately. Fuck off, plague rat ......... we're doomed say people America factories processing food despite workers testing positive Covid. surprised. proves Covid travel packaging food infect others. healthcare workers part essential workers? Illinois distributing first healthcare workers, long term care facility workers, ""critical workforce"" assume people like police. company right monopolize video communication

Well good thing plethora video hosting sites places upload videos share I'm dreaming IIIII-cu Christmas

To hear code blues hall.  man half lung issues respiratory system? isn’t Flu bad year normal? old people retirement homes. nurses, teachers, doctors. also think people see older people worth less, fucking idiots. medical community try, believe result same. answer, patients written mostly “anxiety” given psychiatric referrals. exercise eat better they’ll say!

There’s virtually understanding even widespread acknowledgement post-viral illness. Personally think it’s acquired auto-immune phenomenon, medicine rather poor understanding recognize treat even known autoimmune conditions. DM start argument here? Don’t feel like getting mod public forum  I'm even autistic great relief. way assault charge. Slap wrist that’s ends. common interpretation after-effects? I’m seeing mentioned often past days. Yet fine ghouls wishing death New Yorkers Yeah, watched early pandemic. thing sexed disease itself, seemed virulent aggressive speed killed spread widely. DIDNT SAY THAT!!!!! job anti-masker brandish gun employee asked put mask on. Nice flex, hehe.  think Chinese Vaccine already ready phase 3 health canada wanted redo whole process 1/2/3 China decided went brazil phase 3 testing. 

i suprised iol eye came russia (lens+iris) available na , doctors waited health canada aprove 6 months later still go , redid paperwork ""italy"" aproved next week. (5 years later still issues whatsoever) Thank posting this. 

One thing really helped NYC large number medical staff traveled northeast help back even less known virus.  Fucking heroes. Money talks lot... It’s like cocaine addiction... Can’t wait. Cold dude.

No.. original goal lockdown, last resort solution already lost initiative, 'reset' spread get second wind. Buy time plan ahead, empty beds, prepare supplies, ramp testing, implement working contact tracing. expected _keep_ flattening curve. Nobody really moved goalpost. goal always spot.

If truly thought 4 weeks hunkering would end epidemic, intelligence sub-optimal. think are. think whiny restrictions seem going end actually sooner experts originally feared. Indeed, virus drove humanity denial dissonance studied decades. need shoot someone job asking wear mask, piece shit.

*I say apparent sarcastic air quotes plenty people businesses disregarding mandates I, personally, think much paradox claim. Levine said that? Seriously Wolf fucking idiots think that’s gonna fly. People already looking “limited-time” 6 week “only leave house essential reasons” order saying deez nuts Incentivizing vaccine option. PHO allow vaccinated folks enjoy travel, restaurants amenities. mention higher priority triage necessary hospital emergency rooms. easier safer manage patients risk medical staff. enough lions, herd help. they’ll continue protect airborne diseases. little year ago encountered lot Asian folks wearing masks flying.

It different standard mature vaccines around while.  


I definetely get vaccinated want amongst first receive it, given choice would prefer Oxford University Queensland one RNA vaccine. Thanks. typos missing words due typing cell. Fixed sjojld read better.

Still, long story short... hospitals handle small bouts capacity issues contained specific resources (be beds, staff, supplies, etc.).

COVID forces need increased capacity everywhere. Enough patients overtakes ability hospital care regular patients. Even ""elective"" surgery might feel elective patients. delay routine diagnostic imaging, could catch cancer late. Patients come chest pain could heart attack.

I feel like things discussed early everyone ignored this. I'm sure arent focusing flattening curve again. get everyone feels try eliminate virus community via sustain, aggressive lockdowns. ever happened overwhelming hospitals?

The tough part experiencing simultaneously huge strain testing supplies PPE. 

And hell hospital due things simply exist? creative start risking staff patients.

The hospital ability stop either. hands community... faith low. I'm NY feel fairly fortunate regard showing immune second surge either. Reddit thinks saying slightest negative thing public health precautions makes rabid QANONer. prime minister firstly, secondly polarizing figure many people liked. Far worst Prime Minister.

Also Justin Trudeau liberals cancelled early warning pandemic comittee back 2016 first took office. Masks work wear time, that's realistic. drastically lower spread making subways stores safer, 100% worth it.

People still meet private though. I've saying almost better keep things open, controlled. spend 8-10 hours/day work wearing mask. 0 COVID transmissions work (we get tested weekly, people come work several days tested positive without infecting anyone else). basically fills social itch. home time I'd probably least week friend's place. can't talk humans. impossible. went nearly crazy trying. gatherings, private, would never masked.

Close schools tons play dates, moms chatting wine 3x/week, kids playing maskless groups kids. Parents outside r/coronavirus letting kids go without frequent social contact.

Close stores everyone piles one still open.

Limit hours everyone errands time.

What needs closed bars clubs environments can't keep sense order, distancing, masking. everything else, cut orderly outlet socialization, people open outlet disorderly socialization. Cmon.. redeem eventually.  Interesting.

This *biggest* thing me. voted Trump 2020 - I'm going associate you. all. one three things - 

1. Consciously uneducated refuse listen facts.

2. Far concerned selfish issues *really* matter grande scheme things (I know dems voted trump *only* Biden stance guns).

3. racist, sexist, bigot likes trump it. 

No matter category fall into, either selfish, stupid, piece shit - want absolutely nothing fucking you. Could specialists give input sth? 1st, ""herd immunity"" policy come from? 2nd, practice based evidence? 3rd, ethical expect population get sick instead preventing it? fucking shit! take plastic off. wish would give detailed stats filling icu beds. Age? Sex? Health issues? Previous current smokers? 

These people need isolate themselves. Keep blaming others hide truth. Yuuup. It’s becoming uncommon sense. go work FCA joke shop. Even better, victim asked woman wear mask, woman called guy, rolled gun. course. exact reasons housing prices going desirable locations. entire country gone insane. people buying propaganda..... enemy strong weak.

That's propaganda nutshell. No, point assholes worth maybe dying for. course deserve it! wear mask? YES, COURSE! pisses end many assholes complying. also know assholes shit like shoot you, stab you, spit you, etc. hill willing die hope die either. mask police aspire be. wise argue crazy people. know they're hopeless. brown you? is. Scientists say is. beginning pandemic age. really, really, really need get shit together fast.  mask compliance interesting. Could share more? you/does one get mask compliance data?

I’ve always suspected pandemic protocol exhaustion struggled support hypothesis. careful right they're getting legal protection copyright infringement they're 'platform' ad host everything anyone wants.

If companies like Twitter, Youtube, etc start making editorial decisions within realm plausibility could legally lose legal protection since they're making editorial decisions. Yeah, right reasons, unfortunately bunch people dying nothing huh? That’s fucked. Fuck die. friend lives Boone, Iowa. March, curiosity, spoke someone hospital asked many respirators had.

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (KKTV) - UCHealth ICU nurse Hannah Paik could take everyone field trip hospital floor safely, would. wants everyone know what’s happening communities, even can’t see first hand.

“We’d turn prone patients us!’ Paik added, sarcastically.

State data shows Colorado Springs 14 open ICU beds Tuesday local hospitals preparing moment space care need most.

Paik says floor Memorial Hospital Colorado Springs, she’s already seen makeshift beds help surging caseload.

“It doesn’t feel like end sight,” Paik said.

The nurse works 12 13 hour shifts said keeping morale challenge coworkers faced mounting crisis, continuously gearing fight battle losing country-wide.

She said praise support getting spring amazing, while, would simply prefer people take action stop pandemic.

“We like ‘I don’t care food, don’t care snacks.’ want need people wear masks, responsible socially distance, cant keep this!”

Working long hours taking toll, Paik said emotional burdens seem weight most, keep falling asleep.

“We tired beds filling up,” Paik explained. “We tired watching people die. also tired hearing family members say ‘Isn’t anything else do?’ us say ‘no.’”

Paik explained we’ve known while; easy fix right now, even medical advances.

“There cure COVID-19, supportive care COVID-19, cure it,” Paik adds.

“So think part confusion people say ‘I don’t understand, things, isn’t family member better?’ Well, trying support family member’s immune system! super medication comes eradicates COVID-19 like that.”

While run space put infected people statewide, Paik sees medical workers inside ICU rooms, helping families say final goodbyes iPad.

“Our bedside nurses holding tablets giving patient kiss hug family members…the family member can’t that,” Paik said.

“That really hard come work every day.”

If you’d like take moment thank healthcare worker sending short message online, smoothest brain. Yes, always way. say, much threat. way means threat. Still hearing stories young people, even kids dying this. Honestly *do* think sort exponential strike system might really make impact. First infraction 1 week, second 2 weeks, third, 4 weeks, etc. one state government wants touch this, expect federal government to, given less authority. Lol living life shoppppiiinnnnggg!!!! Fuckin losers Don’t racist rants making Parler right now?

Don’t weird nerd sub day. It’s pathetic. Dr. Fauci going irrelevant within months. ""If CDC delay rubberstamp approval nearly month holiday season, Covid probably dangerous."" Flippant statements like help nobody. 

People locked nearly year. That's *small deal.* news tries justify authoritarianism make something else. china propaganda board.  Fucking smart say state propaganda they're sucking trump spouts bullshit they're spewing. There's also LOT CNAs like call ""nurse"". even LPN, literally someone took month course (in state FL anyway).

I patient care tech, CNA + could blood draws, EKGs minor things would never call nurse. 

Whenever someone usually ask RN exactly term really broad days. Factually true. too. I'm willing accept sort threats.
I questioned data (would stupid share it), even less impliying anyone cheating them. come lack reading comprehension.
I've critized communication strategy (which something crysis proportions specially taken account).
I've even said believe data shown worse (not better) results days, think make public statement it.
So, criticism would focused Pfeizer, Moderna.
I said anything specifically Moderna, accusations nonsensical.

What actually think Pfeizer's announcement triggered Moderna's one. Maybe not, that's definetely impression gives outside, Pov look good.
I'm questioning data, I'm questioning fact playing expectations instead taking prudent approach.
They speaking dates (which something fully hands yet approved) even making reckless statements would 'back normal' (which idea clashes efforts many people, institutions governments insist overconfident yet). I'm obviously referring this. point pretty clear start.

I impression interest starting dialogue get pissed call 'ignorant' (is welcome thread? see edited comment said said. wrong enough change it, guess honest thing would apologize too) accept kind threats. Ironic, telling someone do, like told someone do. Ironic, perhaps hypocritical. Damnit son, that's almost 6 F-150 Lariats worth profit. LMFAO! know, assume events like usually end civil suit perpetrator(s) prosecuted. going well deserved hot mess women well man. problem. Misinformation (not will) fucked entire planet. Conspiracy theories run rampant, people believe vaccines, think world flat, democrats drink baby blood, etc etc etc. Fuck hell, ironic sheep. sad truth every time watch junk wondering split second watches/read/believes junk

It keeps reminding half world average intelligence. average means :( I'll go step say johnson&amp;johnson one especially since one dose AZ kinda shit bed. Even Russian vaccine beat it, c’mon insurance shitty (ACA approved less!) I’d probably still pay pocket met deductible. said give fuck relationship mom. first post next one telling nothing wrong person said. 

What pisses people adays think okay shit opposite side(reps)while wanna treated respect shit lol fuck expect people respect without respecting them.(that obtained force)Oh forgot guys got media back. anybody disagree okay side tell person shouldve aborted yall go nuts pronouns. see tricky judge happend. 

Am saying happend right one left get justice like said somehow okay non reps shit reps past four years . Everything starting personality phyiscal appearance cry mention things them.

Great way make covid magically disappear. chance implemented US.

There countries US. doubt anything could done states avoid disturbing situation.  This. mean announced first vaccine, people went ""we're clear"" started booking tickets see Grandma Thanksgiving. seemed think even idea would rolled out. Yes masks mandatory there're fines failing so.

There arrests imprisonments persons turned disorderly violent asked wear masks, wearing masks per se. Fun fact, spreading fake information hysteria COVID-19 also results jail. think like coronaviruses go...this highly contagious indoors winter months especially. Antibodies seen 90% patients 28 days. Bad. 3 months? 6 months? 90% decrease 80%-60% worse. take vaccine every 3 months? supply? There’s couple hundred thousands doses 300 million US. use supply months comes back? 

Someone tell I’m wrong. awful take, **an individual actor never change systemic problems**. reckless encouraged. basically risked life what? think part guy going change interaction? think going educate rest dumbfucks like guy country? 

It's really crazy see comment like encouraging 5'2 130lb woman engaging possibly violent encounter thread someone killed asking someone wear mask. Capitalizing word headline typical, appropriate place one could shoehorn punctuation sentence. war terror absolutely necessary carry way life UK. Arguably, regular terrorist attacks part way life given Islamic terrorism paled comparison attacks made IRA British loyalists. literally factual news - exactly showing off? special needs 5 y/o started calling masks “face blanket” chilly mornings. NYer get spiking states learn experience. messaging problem, politics wanting pay unemployment alienate conservatives, political pandering? Norway: 33717 cases, 6200 cases per millon, 314 deaths, 58 deaths per million

Finland: 22289 cases, 4020 cases per million, 384 deaths, 69 deaths per million

How exactly Sweden worse anyone else? 

And consider 10x difference per-capita deaths ""slightly higher""? I'm hoping johnson &amp;johnson vaccines get approval quickly moderna pfizer. I'm inclined get one traditional vaccines sooner one mRNA ones without seeing long term side effects might be. say it, want wait see bigger sample people take vaccine, make antivaxxer. wanna DoorDash casual observation, work thousands employees students France. moment August September started dropping masks video calls -- often public places, workshare spots, etc -- started confiding heard secret underground rave parties. August, pretty top things spoke me. within know 6 weeks spikes lockdown reduction cases.
I say -- two favorite work colleagues sick Covid 5 months. One professional athlete developed secondary covid heart condition cannot stand own. Another head whole department, bed since late August, hardly able anything climb bathroom. YouTube becoming totalitarian. arbiters gets make money. know know they're pretty close other. Based upon available evidence, appears America tired considered first-world country, much less superpower. Baffling. need. Vaccine almost out. DC masked heavy. time masks come seated establishment seating either distanced outside. Mayor announced restrictions sure establishments even open moving forward. Gonna long winter. Murdoch sky news press told Australians follow Sweden’s model oh wait didn’t almost local transmission free

Seems using logical option following experts work funny enough world people insist politicians kind personal agenda keep people homes?! insane argument I’ve ever heard. don’t live states, opinion governors idea absolutely baffling me. I’m pretty sure politicians would prefer us nasty masses going work, paying taxes, consuming anything everything, whether buying stuff going places, economy keeps rolling donors keep raking dough. Thats kinda rude inconsiderate say someone who’s risking life provide service GOP never gave shit NYC 9/11, convenient excuse go kill brown people. im proud american Easier said done, non-zombie. covid 19 cases rising... please wear masks. case, public schools exist. Nice try first batch people got vaccine half year ago. Amazing, huh?   type treatment already used treat cancer. vaccines using technology cancer research.   one high risk groups, nobody would offer vaccine anyway. realize that? Well, that's news, fact. don't? Besides, matter *why* post?

Have ever heard term ""ad hominem""? like 6+ months safety data. Phase 1 trials began back May fucking duh. ""being held ransom"" means unfortunately within 10 months novel infectious disease emerging able develop, test, validate produce 12 billion doses would needed vaccinate world, yes suppose criteria held hostage. 

I mean seriously damn critical, go make biotech historic milestones inclined. bad person. means lack rational thinking capabilities could ended shot like person maybe day court. Sadly, many crazy people edge looking reason use guns. I'm glad hear that! funny internet (and reddit particular) simultaneously best worst thing. experience becoming charitable, accepting, even self reflective participating reddit year. 

Stay well safe! Great comment.

I also wonder part motivation people get back work sooner, highly essential healthcare workers. Considering increasing shortage them, figure marginal risk worth immense benefit return 4 days sooner.

Also love apt usage scofflaws panopticon  That's apparently malaria drug trials whether could used cure COVID-19. latest reports indicate, effective coronavirus may serious side effects.

So really see what's wrong news outlet reporting might possible cure. clinical trials time ago. shows current week, past four weeks numbers/ranks changed time?

I mean, obvious title two charts? absolutely right. also good deal cheating, buying black-market rationed items using connections get extra ration stamps. Rationing U.S. mild compared England, civilians occupied Europe, Germany Japan even worse. know got downvoted practical truth. There's way knowing anyone going react public confrontation. that, stage pandemic people wear masks potentially ones mentally unstable radicalized opinions. chances hurt shoot much higher. I'm standing bad behavior, I'm going engage crazy person chance going change behavior almost nil, chance violence high. No, never policy common sense. cultural Asia, studies actually warned non-medical staff wearing masks March 2020. False sense security, improper usage imparting value etc. April, despite new studies, western govt health officials went mocking discouraging mask wearing insisting enormous effectiveness. Yea, watch next one another century, good luck one.. /facepalm Oh dear people refuse get tested. wait hospitalization peak catches deaths coffeehouse area February put “Coffee cures corona” marquee. It’s still up, less funny now. Reddit obsessed finding way make big companies/capitalism bad hullabaloo confusion trying find bad Ford buying freezers reality isn’t anything bad it. It’s good thing. That’s relevant policy discussion, way you’ve put respectful, would permitted.

If say *deserved* crippling outbreak policy decisions, wouldn’t fly. 6 years really solid podcasts covid. There's playbook new virus. Everyone scrambling find something works expect anytime something looks promising, enough data show otherwise, going get promoted sharing little data best thing do. give hope effective treatment miracle drug, accept can't count one discovered best avoid catching virus meantime. think best we're gonna get 50%. words, 80% Biden's 20% Trump's. Well go: shit abhorrent too. Nobody defending violence kind. matter violent anarchist riots anti-mask idiots guns. political issue, something agree on. Well....it’s not. look PBS read Atlantic article “Parler” - it’s good read. Basically FB YouTube started didn’t realize algorithms would produce externalities. 

These algorithms far right huge here. wasn’t since 2016, they’ve recruiting young impressionable men women FB YouTube since 2007 - remember.

dude I’m joking read 3 points evaluated whole thing like, “yeah ok seems understandable?” completely ignored last one, probably short slipped sights. Sorry. one *quirky*. Ah yes deflecting, never seen before. Thanks proving point.

Let see. I'm sure dig sources talking shortages ULT freezers. that's fake news, quote I'm lazy. I'm assuming comprehend them.

On plus side still months get straightened out. Thermo fisher McKesson make nice profits one. appeal authority fallacy common one. Go outside around ppl without mask then, fact go hang covid get it, I'm serious. probably fine save need vaccine. anti-mask terrorists need meet business end cattle prod.

2. mom told deserved shot asking someone care community members, neighbors, fellow human beings, I’d tell fuck off. 
3. aborted far worst thing happen anyone. Existence pain Lol yes course!! people actually fully quarantining two weeks traveling. Everyone says, I’ve totally isolated except this. Ain't truth vast majority cases Europe USA contracted locally, international borders irrelevant. like Germany USA accepting exponentially increasing number visitors. requirement controlling spread virus reducing infection rate 1.0. See, thought might impressed mean win dead. That's big difference words.

What think someone says ""all forgotten"" regulated history books.  ""Tegnell past said herd immunity hard measure even questioned official figures. Swedish authorities made clear immunity isn’t policy goal, **nation’s exposure virus makes obvious test case observing theory.**""

Belgium seems like much better candidate, considering numbers far worse. frustrating could prevented. whole world saw happened spring understood virus, yet many chose believe fall victim, going again. leaders media personalities fueled spread disinformation punished.

1.	Extremely restricted international travel
2.	mandatory(guarded) 14 day quarantine
3.	proof effective vaccination available. course see signs virus stopped herd immunity. Herd immunity never achieved sweden. would 60+ % populace infected virus first place. basically: 
Sweden would 6 7 million infected inhabitants achieve herd immunity.

They far threshold - luckily:

226K confirmed infections 10.1 million inhabitants today. pretty close estimated infection rate sweden ~2.5% April 2020 But, please, make pay possible run covid ? says end goal herd immunity, how?

SEOUL, South Korea — deaths mounting, public’s fears.

South Korea vastly expanded flu vaccine program cover millions people, prevent one-two punch health system coronavirus spread globally. injections got underway, reports deaths started popping up.

South Korean scientists quickly determined deaths unrelated flu shots. worried didn’t stop panic, public might shun vaccines altogether.

So health officials doubled — and, process, gave world game plan coronavirus vaccines become widely available.

They ramped efforts communicate public. disclosed data found. quickly got vaccination campaign back track, time scientists dealing Covid-19 increasingly worried rise anti-vaccine movement.
“S
outh Korea everything right,” said Dr. Noel T. Brewer, professor health behavior department Gillings School Global Public Health University North Carolina. “The government gathering data, giving information public quickly standing vaccination program. ensure public trust, help program.”

As pharmaceutical makers rush get coronavirus vaccine approved, countries around world grappling safely quickly distribute hundreds millions doses. Already, pandemic created confusion distrust era misinformation spread rapidly — could complicate global effort toward immunity.

If long-proven, extensively tested flu shot spark uncertainty concern, could portend challenges mass inoculations brand-new coronavirus vaccine. potential pitfalls played small scale South Korea.

The country’s ambitious flu vaccine campaign began Sept. 8, month earlier usual. Health officials announced plans inoculate 30 million people, 10 million last year. haste, problems arose.


A company hired transport millions doses vaccine never carried large quantities cargo before. flu vaccines need stay refrigerated, 2 8 degrees Celsius. Sept. 21, photos began circulating online showing boxes vaccines stacked outdoors, parking lot.

Out abundance caution, government temporarily suspended program investigate. Oct. 6, concluded vaccines still safe, nevertheless recalled 480,000 doses left outside long enough potentially become ineffective.

Three days later, 615,000 doses vaccine shipped another company also recalled, white particles found inside. government concluded harmless protein particles.

I'm close proximity unmasked people day every day. way source accurate data this. then?

Look Figure 2D asymptomatic/mild disease (i.e. majority cases) frequency long term neutralizers. Look Figure 3 analysis showing downward trend anti-RBD, anti-nucleocapsid, anti-S2 abs. Figure 3d shows numerous individuals falling neutralization threshold. Crotty paper article refers extends data 6 months.  Like Cell paper reference, rise immunity 3 months. Guess what? plateaus starts descend. Additionally, look Figure 4C 4E, see large percentage population unable inhibit 50% RBD binding ACE2 indicating lack neutralization either visit 1 visit 2. first paper posted... Yes, look 3D. Look percent population drops neutralization level decreasing. impressive data instills confidence. data driven higher samples large increases neutralization. people I'm concerned I've never claimed reinfection going issue everybody. concerned (as scientists) number people immunity wanes level necessary prevent reinfection. data comes out, greater number appears getting. studies showing support stance immunity somehow increasing. shows decreasing larger number people original Wuhan studies showed 3-7% hospitalized individuals develop neutralizing antibodies 1 month. please put ego away. disgusting unfitting.

Long story short: avoid Covid like plague. potential long-term issues continues increase research done finding. next level ppe expertise we're replying person's post history instead comment says, got laundry list, dude

it's reddit. stop taking seriously. op, worst, encouraged someone website people overwhelmingly going say ""stay fuck home"" social activity. impact essentially zero. They're policy maker, person need uncivil to. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* assuming death rates increase overloaded hospitals... Shows power media. understanding healthcare pretty much first line, followed probably first-line jobs people certain health conditions. health care worker Asthma spleen hope get first round, I'm also direct patient care realistically looking 2nd round. Al hospital leadership said far announce plan approved look results.

Edit: Apparently nursing home residents, still think makes sense nurses get first.  Yep now. sadly drag people state believe real. Thanks raising awareness this. long term health problems (physical neurological) one biggest concerns IMO, especially otherwise high survival rate. Can’t speak specifically vaccine distribution stuff gets stored -80C shipped dry ice. mine. Nobody respects social distancing, tons people walking around without masks (my state mask mandate, mind you). started samples last week. could probably find things Amazon probably expensive Meanwhile, ""personal responsibility"" Mike Parson continues nothing.

Edit: Oh yeah... field hospitals mask mandates. No, stop getting even spreading it. reduce chances getting drastically, 90% according Moderna Pfizer. However, need multiple doses, likely annually future stating lot speculation facts. Hummm interesting approach, keep mind though recommendations plan finalized (per. article). Theoretically could effective way stopping spread, time tell. Already knew month ago. internal email workplace said vaccines would rolled certain companies' employees first, get panic favoritism, process least hundred customers day. want reduce chance super spreader events simple logic reduce potential contagion vectors. yes, Walmart cashier gets vaccine you. also deals many people daily? makes sense. 
I also mention work Walmart Australia island .08% population America. 

Also, previous comment, pointed America unique states vs federal power. issue interstate travel. Jesus Christ yeah let's live lives thinking bring pushed kill us. take us good place.

There needs balance here. Yeah snarl everyone like. sit take shit time either. Bingo Apparently lot sub see lot people talking going 8 months here.

I also think it’s certainly possible get within 6 feet high risk individual people. Especially college campus. Well that’s mouthful driving sales competitors continue using practices.

That's law work usps, supervisor said fall essential worker category, might getting vaccine family does. mom terrified idea, think comforted much saying i'll take one team. Yeah easily expect 2500+ deaths reported tomorrow. thanksgiving literally week, idea impact reporting cases, hospitalizations, deaths coronavirus end week next week, especially protocols reporting surely different state state. 

If guess, surprised see massive drop covid deaths cases late week massive spike sometime mid late next week balancing out. rate, numbers 2 weeks leading Christmas New Years going straight horror movie. Yup. work scientific side biotech/biopharma don’t think I’ve ever worked anywhere didn’t -80s. 

Not sure using college campuses. Maybe bigger universities? remember small undergrad like... maybe two -80s entire college. Versus current lab two 8 us group, probably 20 building...out like 10 buildings company. moving average smooths noise adds delay changes signal. 7 days good window general calendar smooths under-reporting weekend. 4 day holiday, half sample data going under-reported. 14 day average would less susceptible noise, adds even larger delay signal. protecting workers deadly pandemic happens shrewd business practice that's fine me. won't. Catholics ignoring stuff pope says like long there's pope. Blackstone well. Buy em cheap rent 5000 day within 3 weeks rate People go cruises exactly type also go cruises pandemic. understanding Sweden strange constitutional laws severely impacted could respond many countries imposed nationwide lockdowns curfews, measures prohibited the Swedish constitution as considered violation people's freedom movement,[85] and Swedish laws communicable diseases (Smittskyddslagen) allow for quarantining individuals small areas buildings, entire geographical give government break least. comment fact, think it’s clear sub thinks think it’s low.(and they’re wrong)

That said honestly thought would higher percentage, 20% struck low. can't eradicated. worth near future.  rest us going get shot every months.

Do sources this? Seems like anti vaxxer shitheads continue viral reservoirs, rate spread (and mutation) drop fraction now, re-inoculate everyone every months large issue. Unfortunately polite someone nothing whether good person. bother. good person without it. Oh right - that's true. reason every year vaccine producers (or maybe something) take stab figuring strains prevalent.. always right. Sometimes nail vaccinated good go, sometimes get wrong vaccine effectively worthless. compare flu vaccine $40 insurance? Mechanics plus injection something prevent sickness less half price swab test sickness? Makes zero sense me. Papr. Best comfortable use funds respiratory safety, plus bonus face shield. 
Go organic vapor cartridges won’t even smell foulest halitosis. vaccine approved yet, they've demonstrated high efficacy. They'll given limited approval likely December western countries. need Good People guns. Everywhere. armed people, could go wrong? 
It’s like shitty people could get weapons something dangerous, right? True - several 90+% effective.

BUT... going take time manufacturer, distribute, administer them, going months effect really felt. 

And considering hit Thanksgiving Christmas, hospitals going get hit massive surge cases long vaccines come play. Getting shit together involves much vaccines masks though. Like starting treat underlying pathologies systems practices. Sadly think we’ll end fire fighting instead. Healthcare AI Architect here. That’s point though isn’t it? Scale repetitive processes require sharp eye doctor working 100 hours week doesn’t it?

You make models functional humans stop repetitive work instead valuable work. Keep skirting around facts long term effects known until, ya know, time passes. understand healthy individual (the majority people) would willingly become long term test subject virus 99.9% recovery said individuals. lot “very nice” people work won’t hanging become friends with.  Everything say projection. articles/studies showed work vs strains covid 19. said useless. said helped deadlier versions articles overlapping one another. 

Problem people can't even name elements periodic table even balance chemical equations become pandemic experts argue others. smoking also contagious, involuntary, spreading exponentially? Half Europe half Asia. Massive country know when/if come contact high risk individual. like flicking cigarette butt street. one person it, big deal. smokers it, place littered.

My worry majority college age students mentality Tango.  Vaccines aren’t cures, though many people treat one.

At end day *everything* risk-benefit assessment. 

Vaccines perfect cures tilt equation. get April May, vaccines *available* everyone wants one, things start normalizing. hospitals overloaded, stop things unrelated pandemic? Like shoveling snow? Speeding? Opening champagne bottle sword openings fine. never speed. Keep regular exercise routine lower chance heart attack shovel snow. winter going bad one find hospital. you’re seriously injured, you’ll likely get medical care that’s similar would receive another year. minor injuries mild symptoms conditions heart disease triaged, delayed, missed. health effects play years come. get treated hospital add strain already overwhelmed health-care system. one five American hospitals already short staff, hospitalizations continue rise. regional variations answer, overall good time need elective care. especially careful.

The sword part made laugh, seriously please everything avoid adding onto already overwhelmed healthcare system. disruption non-COVID medical care underestimated people say crap point daughter's twenty-two-year-old year old girl friend used advid hiker daughter hardly get day sleep much. People understand death problem, survival subsequent problems are. 1. Healthcare workers - wear crazy amount PPE anymore 
 2. Care home employees 
 3. Care home residents 
 4. Teachers - reopen schools
 5. Old people starting oldest 65
 6. Essential workers
 7. Everyone else It’s exacerbated heated rhetoric (regardless politics) impending civil war; hence verbal gamesmanship. Whoever keeps saying never read lick history. works: Melbourne lockdown rules. that’s timeline infinite multiverse unfurling reality. 

All things possible. Unfortunately. socal central valley big offenders. Orange county crazy! qtip nose test something 113...but vaccine injected inside prevents sickness (flu shot) runs 40 dollars. Wow, 1:1000 really puts perspective. We’re headed direction pretty quick 260K deaths 330 million. deserve another chance, types idiots still unfortunately outlawing private gatherings autocratic measure police know good well never enforce Holy shit legit? 1 5 people hospital beds covid?

Not sure suggesting seems low, seems incredibly high me. can’t even go plane without getting sick. swear every time fly come (pun intended, noted) kind bug. never go cruise, ever “You can’t fight fate” latest comment read this.

This guy brain smooth rolls around head like ball bearing 🐨 I'm morbidly curious, I've always said ""morbidly curious"", yet say ""dead curious""... same? Where'd pick up?  asthma, wear mask outside winter. Death reports live. There's always delay. delay fixed, varies day day. believe reports Tuesday tend lower day hospitals dealing administrative catching weekend. leads Wednesday higher sort aggregates numbers. Every single randomized controlled study meta analysis say masks work. studies going cite support masks recent observational mechanistic studies basically joke science. Yawn Well, history written winners. Oh, take precautions, expect continue masking 2022. 

I might trust vaccines 1 year. fundamental misunderstanding publisher vs. platform. Publishers held liable content publish. sue newspaper publishing libelous content. Platforms that. can’t sue YouTube something user uploads platform. That’s publishers choose publish. Big tech fought legal protection. YouTube, Twitter, Facebook editorializing content uploaded platforms, thus violating law fought passed. many people upset tech companies. saying true, ought true publisher's well. true publishers?

No. all. two separate things. need first understand this. apologize I’m explaining well. dad loving senior hours since numbers going (and COPD) he’s learned order groceries online Costco app! I’m happy about, really don’t want going help it. 

I think even paired Instacart 2 hour delivery? Don’t quote know orders stuff app delivered. There's virus there's disease. always contract virus. virus particles bounce skin. coronavirus causes disease, Covid-19. disease vaccine for. 

Your body know fight disease get vaccine might still symptoms still infectious. non-vaccinated people still around full population rollout takes lot time. really dont know whats wrong Chinese defending China Xinjiang Mongolia. keep insisting putting another country? Yeah. I’ve seen vile humans dark time. first mRNA vaccines ever approved - ever. first time humanity ever tried scale. Nothing medicine guaranteed, especially brand new tech.

I get vaccine, first ones. I’m waiting one currently production relies old school tech. can’t remember name, uses tried true vaccine delivery method (instead one never attempted scale human beings) well known target used types coronavirus vaccines success. drive Honda instead Tesla value reliability else. I’m strongly pro-vaccine - I’m veterinarian I’ve given tens thousands vaccines, hundreds thousands. get flu vaccine boostered tetanus last year got bit cat. got meningitis vaccine HPV. I’ve even vaccinated Rabies, twice, one induces stronger immune reaction site sore days vaccine hurts. Don’t dare call anti-vaccine. know enough make informed decision.

We’ve never option choose multiple vaccines before. Vets decide brands buy clinic. Pharma companies thought kennel cough vaccine would easier give squirt nose. Turns out, practice dogs absolutely hate it, almost universally, it’s dangerous give shot you’re right face. Aggressive dogs get injectable version (you can’t inject nasal version it’s bad do). sounded great, I’m sure things went reasonably well clinical trials, practice disaster.

Medical tech never, ever guaranteed. I’ve also practicing long enough seen drug touted safe end dangerous. Metacam (meloxicam/mobic people) promised safe, ended killing tons cats severely injuring kidneys. I’ve personally injured cat another injectable NSAID neither owner knew cat kidney disease single injection normal dose enough make kidney disease symptomatic. never regain lost kidney function; can’t heal like organs.

I YEARS clinical experience guided me, like many many veterinarians, cautious new medical technology. still scared Proheart (injectable heartworm medicine) even though hasn’t dangerous many years. old version caused lot fatal reactions killed patients. graduated since reformulated safe give now. I’ve given hundreds animals, gone well every single time, adverse events rare now, bitten twice shy.

I cautious I’ve burned pharmaceutical industry. also haven’t forgotten fucked charge much essential life saving drugs like insulin, countries find abhorrent. price gouged fuck US us suffer result. People DIE can’t afford basic medication. Big pharma responsible shit ton death. aren’t majestic, infallible benefactors don’t act good mankind. motivated money don’t trust anyone happy let people die rather decrease fucking insane profits. DUDE. monkaS  Mostly bad news*

Because it’s mostly bad situation. days week. much easier said done feels selfish take day sometimes ignore everything. watch news, limit social media, try make day light fluffy mind kinda ""resets"" rest week. holding long constant anxiety news but, :/ millions people recovered Covid good news. Well that’s case guess US fine! much better many European countries! sounds like one stats thrown certain someone pointing great job he's doing. Freon heavy metal supplies usually produced traded companies. article talks specific counties.

Also, correct I'm wrong here, quick napkin math: we're 13 million cases. population 330 million, means 3.9% Americans positive test. states worse others, counties worse others. seem far fetched counties 5%.

The article 41% 10-person Thanksgiving gathering Grand Rapids Muskegon, based calculations researchers Georgia Institute one three dinner held Saginaw; one four Kalamazoo, one five Ann Arbor Detroit, researchers Bump number 20 people attendance odds go 65% Kent County, 59% Saginaw, 44% Kalamazoo 35% Washtenaw County.

So spot check, see Muskegon 4,458 per 100k, pretty close 1 20. disagree points B C. we're around 5% need 70% herd immunity, implies something like 2 3 million people dead. maybe disease sucks spreading people working home, wearing masks, etc? yeah, like would call American ""anti-American"" goes American values. intelligence something strive That’s live...oh god need careful incidences like Canada? know multiple murdered states asking comply wear mask many attacked (like guy). reminds World War II. times crisis, there's essentially infinite funding tons focus, huge scientific technological leaps made. Imagine far medicine could already gone paid much attention time. past year essentially like Manhattan Project vaccine development compared Sweden two neighbors... countries bordering it. I'm sure cherry picking. anything, accurate compare Sweden Nordic countries would compare Italy Spain. countries different climates cultures offer nearly direct comparison lockdown vs non-lockdown approach. believe conspiracy theories. must extra dumb.

To live world little white lies “never” acceptable isn’t living reality.

Things rarely black white rather shades Gray.

Our National Security lies daily basis safety country.

Should share confidential secrets entire world it’s “never” okay lie.

Absolutes limiting. No, Mondays lowest, Tuesdays highest. FDA approves vaccines emergency use it’s going fucking shitshow. actually lot people scrambling cut line get first vaccines. know damn elites celebrities find way get shots first people need most. Don’t naive!

There already logistical issues delivering vaccine rural areas last thing need someone saying need take vaccine immediately.

All I’m saying people patient vaccines approved. Fewer 50k. Agreed. aforementioned incentives still exist. another proof letting gun everybody good idea, idiots shoot greater threat world gun. amount money help mental emotional trauma healthcare workers experiencing. bought first place continue stunned useless agent ended being. ROME (AP) — Pope Francis’ decision forgo wearing mask noticed, concern, commission Vatican experts appointed help chart Catholic Church’s path coronavirus pandemic aftermath. late jump bandwagon pretend good role model spent months acting like fool.  No. I'm literally not. 

All hear ""publishers publish, authors do."" 

Let put like this:

If saying true, ought true publisher's well. true publishers? publishers refuse publish Nazi propaganda, example, ""dumbing discourse"" ??? think publishers ought obligated publish anything author submits? true publishers? hold Youtube standard publisher books magazines? I'm one people usually find solace dark humour thought 2,100 thought crowds airports families around table doctors nurses already wading hip-deep patients find it. 

Maybe tomorrow seem brighter. Nurses reported covid patients hospital still deny existence last breath. doubt going ICU change mind. really need come new mental illness type behavior. Ouch. sounds like something I’d do. Half people flouted safety measures got virus. people victims. 

You're like people throw trash floor intentionally think oh well that's janitors job LOL if. Teachers severely undervalued. There's many anti-maskers spread reason anyone voted actor president.  average age 92 half COVID died skydiving! /s LOL think people money spend lots worthless shit. least millions us don't. guess people like truth subreddit? downvoted heavily? JFC constantly changing/sanitizing PPE all. Countries crushing covid good news. Vaccine news good news. wish politicians gave concrete criteria lift mask mandates.

For example, 50% population vaccinated infection rates low, mandates repealed. Never? mitigation, getting everyone vaccinated repeatedly achieve real constant herd immunity going happen globally. outbreaks get small manageable. 

These vaccines wear virus still somewhere. Less people get vaccinated time another outbreak. seems like likely scenario. time perhaps mutate toward less lethality like common cold, think remain one problem world has, unlike flu, consistently worse almost flu strain, also genetically stable maybe easier eradicate/treat long term. 

I mean, what's point using term herd immunity short term immunity? make sense. 

When normally talk herd immunity talking viruses produce long term immunity, like measles's chickenpox even specific flu strain. 

I seen claims vaccine produce short term immunity, maybe year, maybe more, hopefully less. However everyone get rollout parts world might take long time never happen, virus around somewhere thing large enough populations likely stay around. 

It would different vaccine lasted long time could get like 70% people vaccinated, even 30% leaves lot people host virus people's vaccines wear get re-vaccinated. always pool people virus recirculate pool grow time initial vaccination point get less people vaccinated time threat decline point look like flu.

Flu vaccination rates America pretty low, kind expect COVID vaccinations decline years levels closer flu levels since big reason people get flu vaccinate caused major outbreaks scare people often. sudden want vaccinations more. People COVID, drop guard stop getting vaccinated. Hopefully virus mutate away lethality infectious annoyance get eradicated better vaccinate dumb luck. think likely sustained herd immunity years constant vaccination... though people still claim herd immunity weather really achieve not. 

It reported news lot call herd immunity suspect, virus still causing small outbreaks mostly go radar. nuke everything, stop pesky virus. next virus plague earth community! live parents basement. Fuck that, never forget lead us hundreds thousands dead americans. I'll pull maaask down
Next every single day Dumbest take I've read today award goes to.  Apparently schools significant source spread every disease EXCEPT covid, remarkable. Speaking parent, kid bringing something home every month infect us before. Since online schooling since April even sniffle. Roughly 10% district actually sending kids school, got email last week notifying parents confirmed case within group get tested concerned... Nope. Unemployment issue. sure cast majority medical professionals thinking much unemployment people getting.

You know they're thinking about? vast disconnect death suffering deal work entitled bitching hear somebody like way piece cloth feels cheeks. 

These folks shove tubes people's throats keep air moving. Maybe they're thinking shoving tube entitled prick's throat. know. people laugh cry Man Midwest gonna screwed YouTube doesn’t publish anything. users do. understand this? It’s good everyone open exchange ideas. advocating silencing ideas platform lazy counter ideas well thought arguments. literally arguing dumbing discourse. think point pretty precedented call Catholic Pope anti-Catholic?

If mental gymnastics sport spokesperson Nike. I’m praying Biden’s admin cement national definition “essential worker.” state let business except bars restaurants declare “essential” issue exemption shelter place letters. Workplaces allowed health departments exempt social distancing “the employee’s work cannot accomplished social distancing.” 

It’s insane getting us shut down. tragic I'll start showing optimism starts turning church pedos, he's nothing PR church get good side youth days Wow. That's amazing. I've surprised also easily small children adapt masks Great points. Regarding last one, Itd helpful track many people *denied* hospitalizations due max capacity. point hospitals/ICUs would overwhelmed triaging it’d difficult actively track metric coordinate reporting accurately hospitals. 

I guess we’ll know death rates skyrocket :( El barfo No. rich people going take vaccine. Especially famous. they'll get first.

You give essential workers makes sense, testing poor.

Stop offering nonsense conspiracy theories thought whim, good anyone else. Cherry picking comparisons? Really? get they're similar countries really fair go way. Compare Sweden European countries, including strict lockdowns. No! preach here.. Common sense left 2020, sides. One wearing masks angry, telling wear mask making even angry. used tell army, hero mRNA vaccines testing decade though Cancer nightmare donating tissue made feel least could help people. know people came helped make treatment reality. true, folks use Patreon like-minded sites apps, make content YouTube - decent folks, create lot good content. shouldn’t feel scummy helping good folks make living. eat. newly diagnosed covid patient Colorado, terrifies There's justification lying. said, whether lied makes difference whether wear mask soon say it’s turned over, don’t think realize hospitalization #s lag, you’re following graphs “real time” current week always shows downtrend #s added back later data comes in.  &lt;popcorn eat think reporter using latex gloves catch term. Looking company's website, make nitrile vinyl gloves too. joke. question asked Dr. Michael Osterholm (now Biden task force) said, speaking administration organization, would accept likely immunity family member PCR-positive last couple months Christmas present, go ahead around them. sounded like implication likely immune relative would pose little danger well. Also, KN95 masks recommend? need use often Dad working throughout pandemic cloth masks :( Americans like told do, matter what, hate changing routine opinions.



That's happens drill word ""freedom"" heads children decades; think get free pass whatever want harm others even insinuating might incorrect.




Basically, spoiled adult children government refuses teach, vote. Mine let people without mask, immediately pull chin pass greeter put back reach line. seen anyone called yet. Covid vaccine guinea pig here. virus spreading control right I’m worried me. really wearing valved respirator? make sense, seems logical based population density counties since going reasoning that’s would highest number patients per health care worker. large swaths large states low population density may poorly covid, get access sooner states like north/south dakota population quite low hardest hit places planet right now. idea. None. one tiny scrap iota thought long term effects virus be. draw conclusions based understanding virology, really clue virus populace age. Yeah crazy look back cases think back thought compared cases today. want leave house 1,000 daily cases. we're averaging 8K-10K really feel like taking chance year i'm seeing people anyway, like said. Thank telling experience! Ahhh, sucks. I'm sorry hear that. Came across interaction hoping good news. issue things horrible night day due anticipatory stress.

Hoping next chance then. knows, maybe lead accident ""working home"" one. Good luck :) Dave told cured Covid shooting lungs. Yup, 5.56 NATO boys - you’ll ever need. prediction ”factually false”? mask protect others you, much others (though too, degree). Ugh, that’s bummer. 3 Costco’s area enforce mask mandate. far one’s douche it.  One worst fears forgetting things. I've worked Alzheimer's ward pretty, put lightly. autism would never either things. know anyone Downs would either. normally functioning brains makes something stupid? ""The night always darkest dawn""

If Covid turns tragedy births whole new era medical advancement pandemic behind us would trip non-issue, simply take vaccine every 6 12 months. Nearly vomited phone reading That's basically I'm at. would love kids cons far outweigh pros situation die car accident, died blood loss  It’s dumb, no. wife got month ago cases tapered bit, local clinic. took turns sitting car, wore respirator (KN95 her, P100 funny pink filter cartridges). remarked first time someone outside household touched felt like long time.

Right cases exploding I’d probably stay home like figure I’m getting viruses so, flu COVID-19. five separate agreements different vaccine companies, also put money research.

We need vaccine open borders. would creek vaccines turned duds. long wear ""mask"" dick, amirite Francis? DEAR. GOD. MAN. I’d love worked like organ donation opt. 


You sign waiver wear mask public (not valid private venue, public transport, etc). get Covid need hospital bed? Tough shit. may shitty sight see, won’t look. SSI, confirm. infallible statement, speaking ex cathedra. Trumpets sure...hope guns illegal definitely getting “taken” now..😂 bad dems elephant dicks can’t come enough restrictions background checks idiots surely guns future worries folks..all well. Agreed, Costco place even remotely ""kinda safe"" looked can't find anything helping make point. Wearing masks public nothing people wear private settings like work. wear masks moment leave house take restaurant bar. It’s stupid. main avenue hard research started 1990s. bizarre one unpatriotic cunt risks spreading deadly disease amongst Americans one took umbrage mask wearing. Trump might get celebrate breaking 29,000 hope, least Illinois massive spike cases we're hopefully beginning see start trend. We'd need people truly give absolutely fucks pandemic hospital data reach rapid amount spread prolonged amount time. Luckily think fact hospitals overwhelmed shocking enough people.  Moral story: 

Mind ya business. employer invited couple doctors take questions employees summer, kind way allay fears. doc got said, “if get this, it’s bad enough going hospital, expect 30 days I’m average, also expect gets bad hospital, survive, could easily leaving hospital missing fingers, hands, toes, feet, arms, legs, simply severe permanent organ damage. good news currently staff medication treat you, probably won’t die, hit limit, deaths follow, would minor problem mitigation treatments would solved going life threatening, everything power stem tide, flatten curve, stay healthy.”

Our CEO like, “ surely you’re telling us worst case scenarios, like people get fine right?” 

And doc said “ I’m telling expect show hospital. Based last 5 months pandemic. Yes, far know people fine, disease still don’t know it. doesn’t affect two people similar demographics way. I’ve seen 70 year olds survive fine, 30 year olds stroke it. use comorbidities estimate chances, nothing known. don’t even know long term effects virus. know spreads easily, know deadly, know cure right now.”

Silence room. 

My company updated covid policy next day, delayed return office schedule make 100% return policy indefinitely. doctor probably saved thousands lives town hall style meeting. joke making laugh. disgusting part prison industrial complex forces pay incarceration tax dollars. want part providing welfare behind bars, would prefer see belongings repossessed pay failures. Full stop, people like past point rehabilitation. bet businesses “no masks allowed” point. bought place town currently live moving work. spent week house hunting first full work days new location. realtor godsend people income, suggest do? paid $250. Friend paid $285. Another paid $120. So...yeah. It’s false masks provide equivalent protection vaccine. Mine does, it’s crazy-looking P100 respirator meant filtering dangerous aerosols. typical surgical mask cloth face covering people wearing don’t nearly much protect wearer. 150k people die every day causes pre-covid. Im sorry blunt comment borderline embarrassing read. 

YES virus serious YES 1 preventable death many simply grounded reality viewpoint. disrespect intended. It’s American company started americans. expect? 3,000 died = never forget


250,000 died = never remember Competent leadership mean anything incompetent people. half population fight back (potentially violently) pandemic control measures, perfect plan go anywhere. Biontech same, although previous focus using mrna antibodies individualised cancer therapy, cool fuck too. us good job. live NSW lives basically unchanged. Victoria really took one team. care high schools closed, parents hate home too... time, high school aged students safe wear masks.

Edit: also, push keep universities open education maddered? complaints get tuition refund... governors freaking closed unis. Europe, lot countries tried, failed, effectively. I'm still wondering case. lack organisation, infrastructure? factors play? example, interconnectedness society? maybe cultural habits spread disease? Maybe even climate, building standards?

You'd think government, there'd least countries Europe would succeed, least time. countries better others, China immensely effective. confirm. nausea real, didn’t last long. PA seeing cases rise steadily last weeks, way higher March peak. feel like government lax limiting gatherings/precautions - that? No, think goalposts always away many people assumed desired. I'm stuck family plans Thanksgiving. Though uncle driving state lives alone socially isolated last couple weeks, risk high 10 person Thanksgiving. I'm frustrated family patience wait months vaccine would rather risk potential death family tragedy measly days visitation. Yes, ventilators. Sorry Like suggested above, write name, date, time. Call HQ file complaint. way keep rest us safe, gotta gotta do. FYI, officially corporate policy. except stupid parents, aunts/uncles &amp; grandparents. holiday like 4th July friends meeting &amp; celebrating. Like Xmas specifically centered around extended family, including older generation who's high risk hospitalized, crippled dying. forget right 40% hospitalized covid patients LA County age 65! Modern medical system designed treat flood ppl healthy. cases divert attention critical care illnesses. Everyone suffer substandard hospital care. well fitting n95 p100 gives justified sense security situations. filter air well probably fine reaches levels worried eyeball exposure. N95 face shield combo pretty effective. That’s point Dr. Michael Osterholm (now member Biden COVID-19 task force) makes. means wear masks, says, don’t let make complacent. put recent podcast, bottom line don’t swap people’s air. Yes already saw happening fox News earlier evening... eyeroll know valve, right? tape something? Get well soon! makes wonder aren’t talking getting New Mexicans back work getting students back school,” Rep. Phelps Anderson Roswell said.

What flying fuck? Half country slept health biology classes goddamn clue infectious diseases work, they're fucking things rest us due ignorance. argue like little brother, makes irregularity important point expense intelligent discourse. pro-mask filled bile make everyone enemy. Wow! goes show guys classic bully's. Mostly cowards fold dont show fear. think I've ever heard someone experience say Cleveland anything place run terrified screaming from.

Columbus bid sweet tho. it, least. people need schools open solve childcare needs. Well 1000s then. yeah, know many hospitals breaking point. 5000 dying day, drastic measures would taken numbers deaths popped would mean like 30,40, 50% community spread. nightmare scenario. Sadly, Trump still President, might get nightmare scenario leadership, action taken. must women. pretty good looking. worse, fuck you, I'll want. Im sorry facts triggered making claim, ask results randomized controlled study However, false negatives common false positives.

This wouldnt false positive though. test detects virus none there.

This detecting real virus, got tested 2 month window *after* infection, rather 1 2 week window before/during infection, old infection triggers positive.

That's false positive. convincing explanation I've heard pre-election polls lining well actual results recent years almost nobody wants answer phone spam calls. people willing take call either unusually trusting, unusually polite, politically aware enough recognize polling company caller ID. pollsters really getting representative sample public. percentage keeps coming again. Hmmmmm, wonder why? [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Maybe summer, although think recommended places another year. case noticed, deaths going up, sir ""muh freedumbs"". amount pay adminstrators like VPs Provosts pretty obscene. FFVIII best series I'll play anyone triple triad says otherwise. Yeah bad lol ! “It set up!” frequently? not, insurance companies cover entire cost. Someone paying it. thing free lunch. Japan's total test date 3.3 million, Iraq, Iraq quarter population....

If anyone think Japan's situation anywhere near they're trying portray, clearly idea Japan's face denial culture.

Go Japan risk. ELI5: vaccine December not? giving opinion oxygen needs flourish fucking time aint feel same. I'm point care doctors nurses went strike. deserve emotional scars horrible treatment society giving them. Exactly. lot people tired give normal lives livelihoods virus extremely small chance killing someone. Yes deaths sad life go on. can’t stay locked houses diaper strapped mouths till 2022. difference us: criticize side one something objectively hypocritical.

They acknowledge objective wrongdoing anyone side, double-down celebrate demonizing side 24/7 least *trying* help right thing majority time. Yeah agree. dislike makes (and others like me) look bad don’t think I’m problematic. seems published online Wednesdays, presented Thursdays' press reports. Honestly, impeached. Denverites, impeach mayors? clearly said likely, highly likely. combined highly likely somewhat likely category together, 90%. Hypothetically speaking, inhale every drop partner exhales? Christmas family dinner, NYE party friends, back work offices ultimate triple whammy. 2020 nothing compared we'll start 2021. Problem karma ICU. kill enough idiots make difference, idiots get awful lot innocents killed.  get it. goes far beyond education issues. much deeper that. Like need educated believe cancer. doctor runs test says cancer, 99.9% believe them. Even get second opinion. Yet weird reason covid made up. fact think social media, real fake news bigger threat society covid. ""Record Hospitalizations"" always phrase used. Means people hospital ever. assumed work hospital 4 12s week dealing COVID patients, sir. scenario means something much different than....

Record COVID Related Hospitalizations means something different nearly severe, yet. 

The former means oh damn, people trying actively avoid hospital flu/asthma exacerbations etc STILL record high Hospitalizations, means something. latter means duh. Read article. time work do.

I get people get this. therapist going convince like forced labor. Jimothy, find meaning satisfaction toil mean do. watch CNN, forget heard it. someone arguing family members can't go big family gatherings weddings I'm confused I'm downvoted presume he’s quarantining arrival, flies back?

Wouldn’t nice blissfully ignorant. Imagine thinking nobody 6 18 months savings. either fine forever poor. Yeah, imagine criticizing dictatorship causing global plague, must mean he's salty domestic policy! never mentioned kind psychedelics did, amount. Idk two trying tell experiences consequences were. really strange ""drug elitists"" online. “Everyone stay home locked down....but Me, me, me!” 

You stay home I’m going still go fun! 

Microcosm America. statement Seattle residents reason unable get unemployment That’s great. happened, case, though. Someone said 5000 day also, think that's crazy. happen? Maybe. definitely think we're going see 3000 dead day period right around Christmas, new years. It’s five months sometimes get bit brain fog, much less severe months ago. spent many nights despairing whether would ever again. Miami (surprisingly) seems taking seriously it’s one harder hit areas, recently went Punta Gorda shocked one wearing masks there. Square gang represent 100% agree you. isn’t Republican Democrat thing. Hypocrisy hypocrisy. 

In U.K. thing Dominic Cummings ignoring rules visit family government sided either didn’t break rules exceptional situation. forget lie went with. 

It’s disgusting don’t care someone generally support not. Don’t fucking dick follow rules like ask everyone else to. Amateurs. LA letting guard foe months. Im 25-30% thanksgivings always suck. Props close family. actually enjoy decent excuse attend year. birdemic, we’re lucky they're comparing placebo arm Brazil vaccine arm UK, yes would valid concern. imagine they're though. guess really agree. Long term, cannot really functioning democracy level education today.

Exponentials hard, simple picture draw (e.g. branches tree).

We need stop lowering bar much are. Exponentials middle school math. Imagine making argument reading, ""plumbing important able read 7th grade level--big words high hanging fruit."" criticism you. position common one, really disagree it.

Also, type plumbing people need extremely low. people better understanding math/science, plumbing electrical work would much easier them. Every predication deaths they've wrong about. fake news wrong. numbers always higher predicated. yes, 400k definitely conservative. expect sustained period least week 4, 5 weeks Thanksgiving see 2500, possibly 3000 dying day. sad preventable too. Hey trads like though. like many grown ass people minds invaded right now. insanity, there's reasoning willfully ignorant. support his, absolutely shambolic. He's lost respect.

This headline read ""Nearly 2,100 died covid-19 U.S. Tuesday, deadliest day since late spring."" one takes kinds hyperbolic warnings seriously. felt you’re describing. covid brain fog different beast. also get accompanying pressure/ headaches it’s really bad. It’s unnerving. Would giving package without union? seen many comments betray ignorant optimism timeline. getting shots late spring. 

Cases peak January. Healthcare recover well spring. 

We better days ahead, long **6+ months** get there, even longer need still mask take varying precautions.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* wish could send that. call fake news yell sending him. really matter deserves it. matters distribute limits transmission, hospitalization, death much possible

Distributing limit transmission, hospitalization, death *are* ones deserve most... Except doing. trying gather data followed original protocol. excluding data shows much higher efficacy. 25-30% Americans blissfully ignorant blatant disregard everyone died lost loved one virus.

That number certainly low. understand exactly saying. curious came conclusion dont original comment. sure seem assume things others little much honestly. probably way get quarantine. Abusers things isolate gheir victims like controlling access money transportation pushing away friends family members. can't leave house work reasons, would definitely harder get away. agree. Long term short term effects COVID seem way likely anything vaccine capable doing. Ugh that's ridiculous. hell money going towards? Lord knows towards heating/ac dorms even basic maintenance. dad wear seat belts either funny enough. areas see declining case numbers places low numbers anyways. “small” county 2 million people. 150-200 cases days, far higher been. county people states.

Go bit south me, county’s 100k people seeing numbers... lot dangerous. places ignoring governors orders masking up.

The dense areas state probably see sharp decline cases. rural areas? Nah. there’s orange county, probably fucked. agree. Yeah do. people like countries vote want it. require visitors vaccinate come protesting street. need another pandemic ruins life kills people around me, think important people live here. sure nobody enter business vaccinated widely available. already card ppl come anyway. might well check vaccination status. really dense one announcing departure. didnt want waste time would never replied.

We arent Heathrow thing happened worst plagues History. attempted stop travel Lords Ladies went holiday homes countryside spread plagues more. another note, conspiracy theorist claiming large companies statisticians liars. get feeling sat several research methods stats courses. 

Although Mark Twain quote, ""There lies, dam lies, statistics"" one favorite sayings; quote picked studying Stats. get feeling sitting talking cup coffee would agree. also see initial comment could seen attack profession. intent. 73in wingspan went bunk bunk that's true sickens see upvoted. still possible everything right get sick. white House white house task force unfortunately page. Nj leading per capita death rate, headline misleading really dense. yea, wasting time you. bye. understand selecting data protocol said would originally follow changing protocol cherry picking data. I’ve read mistake made one trial arms half original vaccine dose given. EXCLUDING data attempting analyze arms followed original protocol. pulling phase 2 data also followed protocol attempt gain subjects. None sounds like intentionally changing protocol cherry picking data. sounds like best standardize data. 

Buried data tantalizing possibility one saw coming half dose first may increase efficacy. trying change current trials add arm in. done change recruitment numbers phase three trials. None shady trying boost efficacy actions. more, wow - may found better way administer vaccine let’s see result replicated trial designed test this. bad enough yet. quite correct R0 case becomes function time due seasonality. We're likewise changing R0 whenever change behavior. example, roughly understand lockdown attempt bring R0 near 1 behavior changes, herd immunity threshold becomes 0% spread slow even mostly-naive population.

And appreciate response. I'd strongly recommend /r/COVID19 interested stuff, much higher level discussion. Absolutely, used attract tourists. relief states attached specific sectors, like schools. Everyone concerned kids, dump lots money tutoring Saturday school lot won’t admit poll f\*king NEWS paper, ""current"" built-in.  Well, gonna like Sequels release Holiday weekend. 9/11 everyday Dead eyes years christianity. kind depends mean ""real"" settings. Obviously needed understanding interest rates economic settings, mentioned.

However, understanding exponentials absolute prerequisite understanding things like population growth spread disease. really need people understanding different mathematical functions order make informed decisions, personal lives voting booth. Nope. staying home extended families agonizingly long, socially distanced zoom call.  article pretty much explains think virus likely made way gathering one family member whose job required work outside home, Aragonez said. family member attended event symptoms thought allergies. even mean? course deal situation hand. Whats hand SD recent death rate highest world.

When people literally dying town right speed faster entire world. gonna stand argue NY death 8 months ago? defense learned Governor Nomnom? wait 3 weeks. get worse. Remindme! 6 months they’re still accepting foreign trade restrictions... theyre importing docking foreign vessels... no? Lol. Human, human. ""If people wore mask month we'd situation could go back complaining something else that's asinine""
And statement patently false. Wearing masks make virus go away, plenty evidence indicates non-N-95 masks marginal value best. lock-down crap April/May kick bucket road. told needed weeks ""flatten curve."" kept moving goalposts lied whole way, enough enough. Christmas + New Year's worries gatherings typically different groups people. Get exposed Christmas family spread friends New Year's. Yeah, estimate simple extrapolation. likely CFR starts increasing health care system becoming overburdened. assume desire ever go holiday another country enter crowded environments. Yep, absolutely true. got downvoted pieces day suggested finding right dosage ""accident"" inspire confidence. This. ONE FUCKING HOLIDAY SEASON! Grow people!! really isn’t. dozens correlation = causation studies many non-medical interventions made simultaneously (close schools, bars, stay home orders, masks), studies use solely masks control randomized study things equal people wear masks others don’t. Danish study came study I’m aware showed 0 benefit wearer. 

Again, masks aren’t harmful think isn’t crazy think benefit, evidence work weak. look meat packing plants everyone wears mask everyone got sick. least may work little totally overwhelmed social distancing can’t followed (and since masks supposed solution social distancing can’t followed, isn’t testament usefulness) Yeah, serve large businesses market research field hit super hard. niche person market research imagine hit extra special hard. We’re basically part specialized event venue. business that!

Even things return normal it’s matter waiting new budgets set, projects planned, finally trickling us.

So we’re coasting skeleton crew point. got scared vaccine news. given widespread time control virus spiraled everything make worse. death rate back high 2k+ levels like May. Death lag 5 weeksish highest amount cases holiday travel. guess maybe depends height weight ratio since Vitamin fat soluble responsible adults actually care family's well-being, ignoramus. Actually no. never intentionally run stop sign life, count one hand times actually done mistake. never driven without seat belt, use turn signal even drive way habit.
There saying political left popularized time ago, ""my body, choice."" Well applies masks too, chickens coming home roost. L.A. resident whose family trying stay locked since end February, absolutely enraging. It’s pretty normal airlines. wife flew 6 years. get many vaccinations. Ok, New Zealand, Australia, Vietnam... country actually borders shut, definition, since international trade isn’t affected? forgot whitehouse held superspreader events top always abused lot lately talking like months ago. always dumb happen gradually? You’ve obviously never lived rural area, absolute idiot.

And no, language not, complete ineptitude does. Chrono Trigger, Cross. OG FFs way XI, Super Mario RPG, Secret Mana/Evermore, OG Kingdom Hearts, etc. can’t give Thanksgiving family, stay home alone. /s dude advocating people u55 instead admitting fraudulent :D yes, that's vibe got also, someone's cleaning up, oh grow fuck love them, mean covid! [In Western Australia (where 7+ months COVID free) dentist got 2 months slammer going work supposed Dude shes hot. look her. Charlie Kelly entered chat.  Vaccines 1 million severe adverse event rate I'm sure going about. Pickup available basically anywhere pharmacy store is. Even middle Walmart both. crude language says great deal intellect. bingo They're dumb inbred enough keep voting him. Find like minded people building strike.

And everyone saying Covid actually much less deadly 3-5% claimed time, world going go giant lockdown would relax summertime wintertime lockdown could squarely blamed people misbehaving people protesting, way lockdowns would get vaccinated everybody would kind ""proof"" vaccination would need work travel part giant ""One World Government"" plan take world usher technocratic surveillance state.

What giant load bollocks, hey? Yeeeeeeep. God like watching slow moving train wreck.  many, is. piece shit  viral load thing, mean two people living together make covid severe one another since they'll breathing viral particles onto person?

What someone lives alone, open windows help disease since air flow remove viral particles room thus preventing breathing back in? mean weekly report positivity rate, released today. rate week 47 11,9%. week 46 12,9% ?? make sense. Sigh. Yep. want consume dry poultry group!!!!!1!1!!!

Realistically, point instead slapping together meta-analysis; would suggest hand data third party firm qualified biostatistician perform multivariate analysis. unfortunate happened; understandable given rush. level misinformation crazy, isn’t it!? 

I read Great Influenza John Barry talks lies misinformation one main drivers behind largest waves death. chilling realize similar mistakes made are. True story. hope get resolved I'm well spoken situations. flu vaccine already free though governor preventing local officials mask mandates? anyone assuming...its you.

The fact even understand I'm talking another big part problem. yet thousands documented cases transmission flights. Plus, “does spread easily” (which false) “does spread”. It’s amazing gets interpreted safe. it’s way less issue false negatives. Sorry would inconvenienced better safe sorry. Cant wait hear excuse too. Im gonna say :

Im sorry many like family, unfortunately, either dont listen, dont care, dont take seriously enough.

TLDR vaccine magic shield prevents virus entering body **which means still spread it**. equips body means fight actually feel sick.

And even though still spread it, assumption spread somebody else *who also vaccinated*, thus eliminating risk. asshole. situation live totally insane. even healthcare workers wear masks consistently. family members work healthcare refuse wear mask many public situations try convince wear them, today clerk doctor's office wearing mask came talked nose.

At least vaccine brothers school going online 2 weeks thanksgiving allow covid run course. Note: testing really lacking Spring peak, deaths happened. People pretty much tested admitted hospitals essential workers (e.g. hospital staff). real number infections certainly lot higher 226k.

Also, herd immunity never on/off switch - gradient affects R0 number. helps keep infections measures social distancing helps. restrictions kept, immunity required control spread. even without restrictions, 70% probably bit high assumes homogenous spread, virus spreads heterogenously (which course lot harder model properly, prediction uncertain).

And avoid misunderstanding, arguing pursuing herd immunity way, want get facts straight. Terminator actually. funny, really guy. Yes is. I'm going downplay tragedy death. personally can't handle death loss all. huge weakness mine.

However. 50 million people die world every year. 3 million die US every year. Covid caused additional 3% deaths world 8% deaths US. great tragedy. Every single one deaths is. every single one 92-97% deaths happen every year.

I watched spread news, online, 200 million tweets hundreds thousands Twitter bots largest marketing campaign I’ve ever seen (impossible developed many months advance) launched another Facebook lasted days FB deleted accounts posts. damage done.

They created division. created anger. created rocket fuel needed doing.

Out everything Covid-19 brought, craziest part US launching campaigns US soil mind-fuck masses. Operation confusion followed right release conflicting stories news daily. 

It extremely easy recognize large group I’m part studied tactics Cambridge Analytica used years ago. Add psychology, text book “division”, protests, etc. control, create perfect environment set stage next act.

Not conspiracy theories - really happened. Evidence still much there. google around.

Anyway, I’m glad brought up. small % people understand bigger game that’s played - citizens played... many taking hook, line, sinker. brothers district holding out, open everyday Monday-Friday since august super spreader events.

Time take kids daycare Higher points contact spreading virus. quarantine teacher forces use entire year sick leave, runs pay sub pocket. Without proper employee protections, hard pass. know hell getting 99.9% from, statistics points towards 2-3% death rate (assuming meant survival rate death rate)

I know many people honestly believe ""taking seriously"" post mask wearing, etc. social media, go hang friends inside, go vacation, Thanksgiving gatherings 5-6 households present.

Those activities driving spread, frankly worry many people think ""masks + 6ft public"" enough. not.

People go work (if cannot work home). People go outside exercise. people utilize curbside options support local businesses. people go doctor. Beyond that, people need stay home. wearing mask good enough. Fair enough. admit heard thing Fed Gov seizing PPE missed thing thing governor sneak PPE like this.

It's amazing corruption still surprising, even people already know much corrupt p.o.s it?

Bottom line being, handle *positive* way, even brain damaged extremely lenient.

It’s woefully inadequate stimulus plan, funded money extracted little little pockets people mostly confused they’re compelled do. Service workers—the people highest risk contracting virus restaurants, bars, gyms—are rarely part union, would make easier take collective action protect themselves. were, situations might closer teachers cities, whose unions strict protections, including cancellation in-person classes local caseloads rise past predetermined rates.

Transparency, Kirk Sell told me, would go long way toward helping people evaluate new restrictions quality intentions local leadership. “People aren’t sheep,” said. “People act rationally facts have, provide understanding decisions made, kind factors considered.”

With mind, asked Kirk Sell question that’s bothering since broke news friend ineffectiveness temperature checks indoor partitions. can’t governor mayor honest? There’s help coming Trump administration, local coffers bare, result, concessions made business owners want workers restaurants employees offices order white-knuckle long possible many jobs intact possible, even hospitals start fill again. Saying wouldn’t change truth, would better equip people evaluate safety daily life, make better choices it.

Kirk Sell stopped short. “Do think might end career, though?” asked. “Probably.” real reason delay? Ugh Oh wow, yet can't understand people understand need follow appropriate procedures end. country, people wear mask may act violently asked it. constantly keep putting like hat. Yet people protest lockdown curfew way make follow procedures. Well, already demanded liability free damage vaccines may cause. struck pretty sweet deal - profits, none responsibility! Josh irritated, me. indoor dining couldn’t made safe, wondered, people encouraged it? temperature checks required actually weren’t useful? make rules don’t keep people safe?

Across America, type honest confusion abounds. misinformation-gorged segment population rejects expert consensus virus safety outright, many people, like Josh, trying everything right, run afoul science without realizing it. Often, safety protocols, things, what’s misleading them. country’s new devastating wave infections, perilous gap exists realities transmission rules implemented prevent it. “When health authorities present one rule another without clear, science-based substantiation, advice ends seeming arbitrary capricious,” science journalist Roxanne Khamsi recently wrote Wired. “That erodes public trust makes harder implement rules make sense.” Experts know done keep people safe, confusing policies tangled messages country’s celebrated local leaders setting people die.

Since conversation Josh, internal logic New York’s coronavirus protocols deteriorated further. New Yorkers become sick, officials urged people skip Thanksgiving, danger eating indoors people don’t live with. Rather closing indoor dining, however, Cuomo ordered restaurants bars simply close 10 p.m. curfew also applies gyms, exactly hotbeds late-night activity even normal times. Meanwhile, case counts risen enough trigger closure New York City public schools, businesses still full discretion require employees come work. (Cuomo’s office respond request comment.)

It isn’t New York; states across country, local officials urged caution fastidiousness. words seem tenuously connected, best, types safety measures they’ve put place. Rhode Island, example, residents prohibited gathering even one person outside household, even open air public park. inside restaurant? Well, 25 people fine. Hire caterer? You’re legally cleared 75 outdoors. governor’s executive order merely notes: “The lower attendance events, lower risk.” (The Rhode Island governor’s office respond request comment.)

Before dig cities states handling coronavirus response, deal elephant hospital room: Almost would simpler Trump administration allies had, point since January, behaved responsibly. Early federal financial-aid programs could renewed expanded pandemic worsened. Centrally coordinated testing contact-tracing strategies could implemented. Reliable, data-based federal guidelines kinds local restrictions implement could developed. country could national mask mandate. Donald Trump congressional allies could governed instead spending year urging people violate emergency orders “liberate” states basic safety protocols.

But that’s country Americans live in. Responding national disaster left governors, mayors, city councils, basically since day one. “You've got lot problems every state develop everything scratch,” Tara Kirk Sell, researcher Johns Hopkins Center Health Security, told me. “First all, it’s lot wasted time money.” Instead centralizing development infrastructure methods deal pandemic, states significantly different financial resources political climates built information environments total freedom interpret data please.

In worst-case scenarios, interpretation privileged politics health population. Vociferously Trump-allied governors hard-hit states Georgia, Florida, South Dakota declined much implement public mask mandate local caseloads soared. Sometimes, sparred municipal leaders trying more. hard-hit El Paso, Texas, example, local stay-at-home order recently overturned state court, even local officials call refrigerated trucks serve makeshift morgues.

Even cities states success controlling pandemic, discrepancy rules reality become kind problem. places including New York, California, Massachusetts first faced surging outbreaks, implemented stringent safety restrictions—shelter-in-place orders, mask mandates, indoor-dining bar closures. strategy worked: Transmission decreased, businesses reopened. people ventured cases began rise again, many local governments warned residents need hunker avoid holiday gatherings, yet haven’t reinstated safety mandates saved lives six months ago. pandemic surging virtually everywhere America; last week alone, infected 1 million people killed 8,000. yet indoor dining largely remains open, even leaders warn real perils Thanksgiving dinner.

As time goes by, think local governments would get better setting restrictions fine-tuned protect people’s safety, worse. beneath contradiction lies fundamental conflict state local leaders forced navigate better part year. Amid pandemic, people govern would generally better served got stay home, stay safe, worry bills. govern, though, leaders also need placate centers power American communities: local business associations, real-estate developers, industry interest groups. groups, whose businesses cratered, vocal desire see people go back jobs pay rent time full. kinds groups developed outsize influence policies made national level, also significant sway state local politics.

The best way resolve conflict would probably bail workers business owners. state level, governors need cash hand; currently, don’t much. federal government, could help states numerous ways, done little fill state coffers, let many effective direct-aid programs expire without renewal. programs, expanded unemployment benefits lump-sum relief checks, successful briefly prevented poverty rate rising time people ever suddenly work. However effective kinds robust monetary programs may keeping people fed, housed, safe, generally line larger project American political establishment, favors bolstering “job creators” instead directly helping might end working jobs. make people safe comfortable home, might harder make risk lives minimum wage McDonald’s pandemic.

Here Tegnell saying months “What see right rapid fall number cases, course kind immunity involved nothing else changed. means immunity affects R value quite lot Sweden today.” “I think it’s likely kinds outbreaks easier limit Sweden immunity population. course, something changed (the season) immunity much lower predicting, even admits sign immunity affecting spread virus.

It's incredible random people internet making accurate predictions course epidemic Sweden State Epidemiologist.

Two weeks ago, staged reluctant intervention via Instagram direct message. subject longtime friend, Josh, sharing photos fiancé occasionally dining indoors restaurants since New York City, live, reopened late September. first, hadn’t said anything. Preliminary research suggests people congregate indoors, infected person almost 20 times likely transmit virus outside. restaurants open legally New York, COVID police. Josh chatted several times early months pandemic safety, felt sure making informed decision, even weren’t one I’d make.

As weeks passed, confidence began slip. number daily new cases NYC started balloon, heightening risk transmission closed space, Josh kept going restaurants. Maybe misunderstanding something risk. Maybe he’d want know. next time posted COVID-19, told him, gently could, trying stay safe, would good idea stop dining indoors.

My suspicions correct. state city reopened restaurants, Josh, asked identified first name protect privacy, assumed local health officials figured patchwork precautions would make indoor dining safe. fiancé even gone one extra step, making Google Map places knew particularly strict temperature checks. listening people told listen to—New York Governor Andrew Cuomo recently released book control pandemic—and following rules.

Granted, kinda like finally reaching water hose / rolling, completely engulfed flames (rather first caught fire)...but still. 

This practically progress them! increase transmission rates equates decrease severity, really good news? Yeah, watched dad die. grateful written wishes.

But this... t’s worse “what we’ve felt”. spend 2 hours phone Friday Monday forgot log onto computer. can’t basic math anymore.

I’m fucking engineer. Well, get fired is.

I am, lack correct way put it, mentally disabled right now, since March. 3 households bubbled rather 3 households makes big difference too. brothers family coming ours, sisterinlaw cant visit father brother, stop chain transmission PHASE 3 TRIALS really help amount people distrust vaccine already. Tech schools thing, much colleges, nobody turns free money. implanted passive cooled M1, honestly even care. school doesn’t allow off-campus housing unless you’re commuting home. sure you’re getting assumption college students live campus. mean end 2020. No, called dishonest. providing proper information, present counter evidence. issue mistaken correctly. difference liar one needs information. Thank resilience may carry another day. Hmm, I’m following, either. mean bouncing covid other? get vaccine likely symptoms certainly severe case, especially age group. said costs much you’re covered Medicare private health, that’s why. LIE. PLEASE, PAY ATTTENTION.


Fuck ass Turkey less 40.000 cases per day. We're dying one pays attention. literally nothing stop it. giving example.

My mother got tested postive Coronavirus 20 days ago 10th night got worse, went 3 hospitals none space. One called us 2 days later, said one open bed come, got better home two days. imagine it. could die 2 days. Even non-COVID times lot schools close residence halls holidays staff don’t work. It’s actually huge burden students nowhere go. university near us decided last minute make Spring semester remote students thought taking Thanksgiving break moving. It’s really messed up. 

Anyway, happen. recently positive, long taste smell loss last? really want taste food again! company similar behavior, lots areas decision making bit iffy, least responding pandemic took seriously pretty much since March, groups every site determining local conditions suitable return site, they've indicated anticipate general return office least second half next year. I’d say it’s worse. Came say this. 
Lots misinterpreting article going on. Normally fighting ignorance knowledge right strategy, normal times. Woah, makes sense. People still aren’t taking wave seriously. people don’t look statistics. judge solely gut feeling think “well wasn’t ww2 March like said would would now.”

They forget forced lockdowns severely slowed spread spring. lockdowns longer occurring due economic reasonings. know guy hospital COVID couple weeks ago died. heard, got Regeneron save him. (I know well, assuming people closer got facts straight.) many spots, one source support statements. want site taken seriously, many, many sources per statement news pieces. I'm sure think lied you. Politicians, maybe? certainly infectious disease experts saying going done months, anything going back normal sooner has. vast majority warning fall surge exactly expected happen.

For context, scientist work pharma. exactly expected happen (although say I've bit caught guard sheer idiocy/determined ignorance certain segment population). TX specifically November, TX also quite large. worked company Dallas-Fort Worth summer. case also happens area. currently pollen air, according wunderground, area. would reasonable person generally get allergies get time DFW. allergic air November? Yes, low. got least 50%. Even people traveling, gathering together people / family live with. 8pm, polish arrived home dinner ;)

yes it’s always “something else”. excess death matters compared month covid humber apparently 300% yes it’s related covid. indirect direct, it’s covid, covid wouldn’t here, death would 2-3k lower. NIMBY, turned inside out.

*It happen backyard* That's nice deflect him. Seriously, ready wiki page Downfall, discussion causalities Top Decision Makers\* calling options invasion. Top Decision Makers may split hairs invasion work, none calling options. Note, know Manhattan project Atomic bombs.

&amp;#x200B;

\* say ""Top Decision Makers"", mean people really calling shots. Anyone less 3 stars Top Decision Maker, influencer best. schools dorms open winter break. shorter breaks. No. likely Americans love lick boot. Jesus end (which hopefully come soon) think wall names people killed covid, erected. 

With quotes across top public officials knowingly played down. Let names literally always associated crime humanity. Every country better us. ashamed yourself

Stop hysterical.

You lied number cases, called (in non-aggressive way) saying ashamed myself. 

This hate reddit. many unreasonable people. Welp! 'red' wave they're talking about. makes sense now. Simple breakdown good FAQs - thanks! Yep, hospitals full actually empty. us nurses complicit. /s right regions surge capacity terms bed space MASH-type army units available. healthcare staffing issue that's worrisome. NY surge medical team across nation flown help shore hospitals. right 2nd wave flooding entire nation. spare nurses doctors, especially who're trained critical care. Yeah among die, says, myocarditis common claiming 4,000,000-10,000,000 (1/10 flu burden) Americans get myocarditis year simple Google search shows less 200,000 myocarditis year. immunity kick vaccinated? Yeah I’ll proactive getting vaccine thanks Public official failing public US. Name iconic duo. Freedumb! responding me? saying let biostatisticians figure way use data. never occurred would use univariate method analyze data. ""Grow up""

Listen there, super adult. everyone's going go endanger loved ones others, royally blows absolute stellar sized balls get skip holidays, even ""one fucking holiday season"". enjoy seeing friends, family spending time them.

So no, put danger, growing up, understanding... matter long dwell it, there's ""out-growing"" absolutely shitty whole thing is. havnt seen father sister almost god damn year. fucking hate guy. ever happened Russia’s vaccine? There’s reason DeSantis called [“God’s waiting Freedom speech lol  completely agree light end tunnel. time let guard down. feel hope I’ve felt since February really it’s time buckle down. tragic enough lose loved one lose one vaccines promising seemingly close would even worse. Stay. Home. Danish study released last week, Dutch one earlier year. really care people wear mask feel better, ridiculous name calling abuse people choose petty frankly ridiculous. 

People enough agency make decisions themselves. 

Mandated laws like literally fascism, understand political reasons consensus science this, say following science half story. 

I get plenty government funded studies show efficacy. really prove anything, especially policy made wear used enforce said policy.

I hope I'm coherent understand viewpoint.  soldiers sacrifice, military would lot smaller. Many reasons. know fair amount mil guys. that’s point. 

I see point you’re trying make accept it. 

However think you’re ignoring psychological needs. Maslov etc. social needs need. Yes safety pyramid, you’re already taking risks. guarantee workers already forced interact others work, ask themselves, well, punish isolate work? That’s incredibly hard do.

I’ll also say it, 99% humans selfish. It’s lot easier isolate, you’re already isolating.  fearmongering. covid long hauler. Tested positive April, test negative July. hospitalized ran fever around 102°F whole time could barely move enough get bathroom. Lay bed gasping breath like fish water wondering next breath would come, next ... several months later barely walk 20 feet without heart rate spiking 120 bpm. wheeze breathe. still cough. run fever on. headaches excruciating sick never stopped. short term memory loss. developed essential tremor. double vision sometimes see spots. Sometimes get terrible vertigo like drunk spins. shit fuck up. personally know two people similar experiences. healthy. young. least temporarily disabled doctors idea future holds. Hey. It’s worse 2!d wave approaching 1st. People still think joke NH. I'm completely confused. people considered smart dismissing science together. ...which profit health care needs illegal US again. Contact Tracing? way many people infected able afford pay amount empolyees hire trace all.

At point think High enough chance Yeah - wife works big healthcare system (she's administrative though able work remotely) - point being, knows bad, parents part ""pod"" low risk. frustrating can't see eye eye. People difficult time seeing forest trees, really. also terrible understanding statistics actually work. always find reason succeed. trick find reasons succeed pretty ya know, repubs give fuck. They're actually told live life. They're reminded right risk people's lives health. idea absurd laws passed mandating wearing masks? middle pandemic. people forced simplest, obviously right things?

My opinion human beings whole absolutely nosedived since began. believe say high begin with. father must misinformed. Malaysia got rather bad road stats last six seven years ( major major effort enforce road rules, strengthen roading, strengthen licensing practices competence practices helped ) total deaths mid 2000s per year ( rule thumb six people would died car accidents end day ). way considered one worst world came road deaths.

Note kind death became intolerable public everyone knew someone died car crash ... 6000 last month dying car crash Texas entire state screaming blue murder.  cool picture Politicians need smarter this.

They already are. Thats say avoid travels plebs like us opposite without repercussions Exactly, think people point pandemic largely acting since...let’s say May. Information people going do. changed outside activities moved inside due weather, suddenly got fatigued. small north FL county. red politically speaking. Lab tests past week running 10-11% positive. purely representative population, positive rate inching up. came Thanksgiving, Odds immunity MUCH higher taking vaccine. large portion population vaccinated odds transmission go significantly. Herd immunity. I'm sorry hear that. hope able find relief recover. know post viral symptoms permanent know many viruses long term problems many actually resolve within 12 months. saying case here, also warranted suggest permanent.

I say fear mongering article low quality clickbait intended gin fear. one person interviewed even tested positive covid-19 (the 78 year old patient) doctor's quote end urging people practice caution looking claims, know reading headline. get lot people anecdotes long covid way people act like almost certainty it'll happen even asymptomatic mild cases.

Personally, know four people covid, cousin mild case, two friends moderate cases recovered. None lingering problems. One co-worker pretty severely went hospital. reporting lasting problems like fatigue loss smell. also diabetes late 40s.

I'm yet convinced think data needs come start pulling hair this. pretty sure mood majority Southern, Mid Western states last spring. mean know Kushner felt worry long-term effects well. *think* I'd die COVID, really like odds damage could got sick.

The US economy set deal massive numbers working-age people becoming suddenly unable work long-term.

It *is* possible people get money [Social Security Disability (informally known ""on disability""), people qualify almost assets left, program structured way makes hard financially get back regular life. (I heard people SSDI hard even health improves work again, means-testing strict cannot save money weaning program.) adenovirus creating immunity adenovirus making second shot less effective, would combined dose two differently vectored vaccines much effective? damaging vs. Dangerous. 

Is Dangerous? Yes. damaging? Yes.

Is Dangerous/damaging lack accountability top? believe is. step opinion. reality people able think act keep safe.  Hmmmm strike that. last 4 years proof happen Odds they'll try forge documentation. Unfortunately thing change minds people losing someone close due virus. Almost works way stigma drug addiction - I’ve seen lot people spit drug addicts, someone loses relative OD mind changes quickly it’s little late. Pretty sure they're saying way erring side caution wait vaccines get distributed, nothing ""rushed."" Also, non-Fauci health officials, especially working local govts, there's certain CYA factor play here.

Ultimately, worst-case scenario, may keep around masks next year, necessarily mean it'll dangerous people gather Thanksgiving next year year.  Honestly ton people acting. acknowledge virus dangerous, one way stop spread stop going eat, stop dinner parties, stop traveling. soon comes mouth go ahead one things we're really good justifying actions. find comments almost thread lock-downs traveling: ""I got test know it, travel right?"", ""It small multi family bubble, trust say something get symptoms"", ""the restaurant got takes really seriously, every booth blocked wear masks seated, safe?"" Tegnell clearly stated leaked internal emails. Swedes gaslighting literally know talking to...your post incoherent. us health care workers family deal aholes keep infecting pure selfishness. hard stay home stop hurting people...its wedding one pair selfish, inhumane, idiots...its effects people clean mess. honestly hell thinks ok hurt kill family members...that's honestly sick. care feel post...I honestly hoping start arresting people keep crap middle pandemic killing hundreds thousands people. Take hoser never said damaging. definitely agree there. 

I however think difference. would hope so. problematic find friend stopped gas way over, touched pump, picked corona, 3 positive 5 days. 

It problematic anyone, personally effected. huge fucking problem us selfish americans. I’m sorry assumed experience severe. lots people IRL say kind projected onto you. Sorry that, experience. sounds similar experience makes wonder aren’t recovering covid. possibility? 

I couldn’t track plot 20-minute sitcom episode months. felt like IQ went 140 70. guess forget traveling Christmas huh? jerks ruined us. live ski town Colorado. tons tourists families taking advantage thanksgiving skiing. understand need stay home thanksgiving, logical tell locals stay home thanksgiving encouraging towners visit ski? Seems like double standard me. can’t expect people stay home also convincing hosting tourists “safe”. don’t get it. serious? I'm denver know idiot all, eff spout important stuff, disregard yourself? leadership position. Make people work find it. Right propaganda misinformation work find supporters. Fox news, OANN, Facebook algorithm come mind. Broad access focused misinformation needs go. want hide little Parler app Stormfront boards, whatever. Chip baby know angry saying - type hypocrisy damaging Trump wearing mask.

Because that's ridiculous statement. president united states lying wearing mask months months would made huge difference way way impactful mayor denver one ever heard giving good advice following it. Work crowd work debut set Title little misleading. Reading article, appear brandished knuckles threatened anyone them. 

He process escorted store police officer ""pulled out"". 

Not bright, bet situation; bad headline made sound. put mask asked left; none would happened. [When Two Pandemics Meet: Obesity Associated Increased COVID-19 Traveling around minimum two major international travel hubs subjecting exposure 1000’s people (every tenth person CO 25% chance COVID) visiting family dangerous wearing mask. Huh?  Cooking big turkey eating leftovers Christmas :D ... right dumbest comment I’ve seen today.


You’re type moron see photo young hitler say “look he’s hot!” completely unprompted. fuck wrong you?

And don’t “kNoW MUcH LEaDeRsHiP” know SD fucked it’s fault.

Are actually Kristi Noem? legitimately can’t see someone would like “lol look hot she’s totally good job!!!” otherwise. true though. know whether vaccine stops asymptomatic spread yet evidence earlier trials indicating probably doesn't. So, R0 could stay relatively high, people care they're vaccinated. yep, read, nobody knew it. it’s silent news embargo publishing actual information big media outlets... Oh well drove Steamboat Springs Corpus Christi...but love driving take nap along way. either way shouldn’t flying. nations’ leadership culture seems suffer arrogance - trying hide bad news always want look strong isn’t Turkey problem sure. Leadership world needs mature realize shame honest citizens humanity trouble problems.

%100 agreeing Turkey, things got lot worse. warning sign extended family struggling get proper non-covid health care hospitals busy covid patients. unsettling.

That sucks. Hoping health them. US could report FTC making false health claims. something similar UK? People going jobs subject article all. 

It's people's optional behavior - one get together friends non-household members, millions, continuing so. 

Not completely support paying many people possible stay home - makes sense - real driver pandemic poor choices people making terms socializing.  understand way ease tension maybe prevent protests, probably going result get togethers. less damage done, knows anything point. Article title blatantly false discussing total death rate. may discussing 7 14 day rolling, say that. don’t even see article itself.

Ahaha, naivete unbelievable. many times wrong see Motives factor. 

:D trust vaccine testing approval process

I know. much stake profits involved vaccine works safe, care people created it.

I do. I'm sorry future losses. hope grieving period painless possible, also hold rest families heads rest life. Surprised melt agree. course doesn’t nearly far reach, however. people like this? Putting mask takes like half second Oh, considering attitudes folks near me, I’m surprised back yard wasn’t piled dead bodies now. Small town, anti-maskers, Covid deniers...current infection rate 1 63.

And that’s small percentage get tested. Based local FB chatter, real number closer 1 24. Japan many morbidly obese, science-denying religious fanatics. hospital work staffing space would issue. Travelers aren’t always easy come expensive. Right whole country needing them, they’re coming us huge numbers. Physical room hard we’re city can’t take space around us. can’t always build buildings hundred years old, can’t move another location you’re within community needs served. lot places surge plans place, they’re always functional reality theory, work covid. submit plans minimum 50% surge 100% surge plan paper-using OR, PACU, pediatric ward, etc., would never staff actually use it-especially amount real time. Maybe day two weeks. It’s really staffing issue anything. 

The icu occupancy rate-I’m mobile hard decipher, rates based normal number beds surge number beds? It’s location also. state may capacity one location another. Transfers happen, transferring critical patients isn’t easy, cheap safe. took 30 patients NYC spring. Hundreds miles away empty packed. happened, it’s far ideal. It’s better control spread put many stresses system. 

I get saying, it’s bit like planning hurricane. much really don’t know exactly hard hit. flu epidemics become unable sustain epidemic growth 10% immunity. Flu respiratory virus, sars-cov-2. people believe anything fomite close-range droplet splatter infection vector.

It's flu strategy - try hit 10% without vulnerable individuals infected, epidemic goes away. Tegnell-school thought threshold might well higher 10%, sure would hit eventually would end.

This work covid-19 due high infection variance, higher expected IFR/CFR, aerosol infection asymptomatic carriers - sunk cost fallacy tough opponent, they're still waiting magic threshold.

The fact wave 2 hit Sweden \*harder\* rest Scandinavia really gut punch flu strategy, means sign near magic threshold, essentially look back square one.

Which Asian experts - know sars family coronaviruses - saying along. can't slow-burn this. It'll become endemic.

However, seasonal flu common cold long idea eradicating respiratory virus seems insane unnecessary many western (but especially Scandinavian) academics.

It's going tough sell containment necessary. We've forgotten that, requires. Yeah, read/hear comments doctors scientists, get anxious. general public hears message, assume fear mongering, shrug off. lack basic understanding science math devastating communities already difficulty pandemic. 

I’m afraid bunch doctors nurses quit leave position, patients need most. PTSD among medical professional severe.  Dude smoking hot. get add assault deadly weapon charges huh? well, fairness, *is* pandemic. else gonna besides drink alone?! Im referring looks job. Move SD see goes you, then, since know much leadership love accuse people murderers. Maybe set example? That's lot people dying. remaining restrictions removed? New Zealand Australia opened pretty damn quickly weeks cases. Dropped mask mandates, allow tens thousands stadiums, etc. Overall, Oxford-AstraZeneca trials appear include relatively participants age 55, even though group especially vulnerable Covid-19.

uhhhh, that's good sign.  I've already 9 months since would big deal. Thanks ""fellow Americans"" made difference.

Not I'll stop it, screw everyone hasn't. collected UK study though think right part interim addition, weekly swabbing done detection infection assessment vaccine efficacy US trial protocol mentions monitoring periodic blood samples asymptomatic infections. Listen: shop Walmart sometimes, judgment per se, AIN'T WALMART SHIT HAPPEN.....jfc. TLDR: Sales stopped 5pm Wednesday 8am Thursday, exception deliveries. hypocrisy isn’t real issue here. 

Think it: 

If *genuinely* believe traveling celebrating Thanksgiving people already live likely lead directly people (you others) dying, things? 

Approximately 15 seconds reading comments people *genuinely believe getting together Thanksgiving kill people* answer you: no, absolutely don’t. 

These politicians hypocrites, sure, - that’s pretty expected them. 

The point matters clearly don’t believe they’re saying risks covid - even selfish person doesn’t X genuinely believe X likely kill someone love. never staunch “America best, freeeeedom!” type guy, especially lived abroad socialist leaning country. 
I enjoyed upward mobility US allow though. 
What come stark view pandemic need reign mentality country. 
I don’t think happen quickly, adopting even iota East Asian culture could help temper great disregard society (ie: anyone yourself) become rampant recently years. 

What say glad live state strong governor actually cares people fighting would put misplaced unscientific thinking ahead friends / family / neighbors. 

Off topic bit, geologist see future pandemics coming about? 
What seen forcing nature come closer contact humans (for multitude enabling factors) almost guarantee future pandemics like this. 
Also, take much worse global climate change could potentially COVID-19? 
I fear start seeing “smack face” level proof upon us, way simple vaccine. That's mean. I'm ok lockdown, can't face aunt sober Thanksgiving 😂 Florida country, would 6th highest deaths per capita, including microstates San Marino Andorra. Removing would make 4th highest. fact Florida ranks 15th amongst states deaths per capita shows poorly country whole done combating COVID-19. 

Also, [Florida's hospital shows 22% ICU capacity 25% total bed capacity, 34%. mean like tribal leaders forbid take action protect themselves?

They’d done better without Noem’s mommying. Thats lot people flying So? said literally every disease planet. would sooner die permanently mask social distance. visiting aunt friend next town over. everyone isolating week we're thinking pretty safe. 

then booze watching football weekend celebrate end fall semester.  two days ago literally less tests infections two weeks prior many people depend work sites source social interaction. guarantee desperate get back. cousin 4 kids online school also fucking miserable work home.  would guess north 50%. mother retired intensivist, confirmed 100 thio, 100 sux 100 apologies quote. ICU teams understandably rely partly dark humor allow function environment bad outcomes daily fact life. Ah shocking. people sick cesspool South Florida . predictable outcome given sorry entitled people living Dangit put skipped record player think last week...and week week that....god can't wait over. No. choosing live life way want live it. That's living fear, that's living free. asking federal response, been, say, lacking? mean, Trump wearing mask pretty damn damaging. 

But agree sentiment. people asymptomatic cases barely spread COVID family US slightly smaller version this. (I don’t live US wasn’t there)

That's worldwide pandemic worst point date country. education system failed country. teachers fault. fairness 50% bare minimum, settling others proven 90% effective. know logistics cost make Oxford vaccine attractive, right give poorer countries weaker vaccine access good one. schools require freshmen live campus quite also require sophomores live campus that's least 1/4 college students live campus I'd willing bet include frats sororities close half college students live housing school charge of. current [airport traffic survey data indicating 20-30% US population ignore CDC guidelines person Thanksgiving gatherings, post-Thanksgiving surge COVID-19 'potential' surge. going happen. 

Some areas country already verge humanitarian crisis. Christmas lot places U.S. midst crisis. Hospitals use disaster triage protocols allocate scarce resources. That's horrifying prospect. major crisis creating, collectively.

So far U.S. economy appears largely defied gravity. COVID medical crisis worsens February, expect - absent government aid scale nobody federal government considered - fall deep recession unemployment crisis.  another study cites states covid patients studied hospitalized 3 5 days ALSO cautioned there's enough data say definitively longer term complications due covid something else data needs compiled.

Currently internationally recognized proof vaccination yellow fever certificate, written hand easy fake. It’s going get worse. There’s nothing done. 

People traveled. Thanksgiving tomorrow. Hospitals already overwhelmed.

It’s amazing people working ICUS across nation actually GET IT, COVID-19 hoax. Wake up, Sheeple!! looks like huge douche canoe. It’s almost constantly evolving situation many unknown variables. “goalposts” aren’t moving, “return general normalcy”. would ridiculous suggest give situation isn’t living arbitrary timeline write much, Automod's watching lol Exactly. Excess deaths take months added database. guess catholic missed mask message pope North Dakota 167 COVID-19 cases per 100,000, Wyoming 140 coronavirus infections per 100,000, followed South Dakota **124,000 cases per 100K**

Firstly call “handful” patients “trend.” trend. That’s you’d call outliers. 

Then 40% 50% percent Covid-19 patients develop neurological psychiatric problems still hospital

Ok we’re talking hospitalized. tiny tiny tiny fraction get covid end hospitalized. sister insisting still, honestly can't believe it, usually level headed, thinks see people anyway what's matter get one house, I'm terrified simply blur faces Italy footage?... listened [the first time Right United States, people walking around masks. 
#
Dr Jon LaPook: **You're sure it? people listening really closely this.**
#
Fauci: Right people should- there's reason walking around mask. middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet, providing perfect protection people think is. 

Perhaps chosen words carefully mattered most. I’m fairly certain 89 year old mother lives Albany daughters headed holiday. I’d read story make sure. learning huge group people country sheep. wait, already knew that. bit another poll showed 40% Americans getting together least ten people Thanksgiving. That's 130 million people... even ten percent tables spread virus could upwards 13 million cases. Doubling current case count one event? That's mind boggling. allowed wear mask choose to? Try get good mask afford. I'd get faceshield go you. request move cubicle farther her? sounds awful. Many people resumed normal life already. Even cautious vaccine. accept thousands flu deaths year (we could really bring people would get flu shots). It’s possible fully eliminate death world. doesn’t. low zero.  easier less frightening treat like nothing flu, claim overblown big deal. 

to admit otherwise takes courage effort, two things people never asked before. people start yelling ""muh rights!!!"" Walmart requires wear pants store? exact thing - rule hygiene protects everyone other's germs. That's actually really good idea! ~Oh there’s place like (the funeral) home holidays~ customer facing jobs, first responders etc told things differently shot, iirc fair, Black Friday shopping home. partner quarantining together since got warm safely see people outdoors. safely exchange gifts whoever share home 😊

Edit: meant cold can't even imagine like hospital worker dealing patients dying. yep first org temporary permanent (for least). recommendation post covid 1 day week site everyone work home expected to. nobody, even CIO, permanent office Totally agree. I've seen attitude elsewhere. get work work, rely social outlet, I'm working people 8+ hours day, eventually going befriend somebody. human nature.

Not that, work social events often lead meeting people work (maybe buddy coworker), often leads friendships romantic relationships.

This either/or thing. Socializing coworkers added perk us enjoy.

Every interaction another human opportunity friendship. Colleges really *should* make annual flu shots mandatory. managed get fucking flu finals week one year.

That was... fun :-/ Lmao Unironically, yes. Especially central Ohio there’s areas 100% reliant local Walmart basically everything. That’s she’s got. Sounds like study misinterpreted twisted ""muh rights"" people. point wearing mask incorrectly mean mask worse helpful rather points people stupid ignorant. Every point made masks making things ""worse"" strictly fallen individual horrible compliance discipline. surprised lot can't even follow social distancing rules either. refuse vaccine hospitals (Canada) refuse help come covid. Simple solution. Can't afford to, I?  Wow. I’m trying argue, never claimed knew anything. I’m expert. say something certainty, please back source common courtesy, things changing time. Get grip. taste/smell come back? Cooking huge part life can’t imagine loss it. I’m also trying gain size/weight nothing appetizing I’ve resorting drinking protein shakes oatmeal it.. There’s predictable 30% again. vaccines. Nope truth want recall ass it. 3000 deaths today???? Aggressively fear mongered virus, expected response elites per usual. donate blood Red Cross get antibody test free. got results 5 days later. blood donation itself, building inside 30 minutes.  Lol. absolutely love you’re downvoted saying female cute. Especially one much indeed cute, sure hivemind’s reasoning one. Nobody gets Covid gas pump handle. parents husband's parents coming tomorrow eat exposed weekly anyways childcare reasons. wear masks well. stress THAT. I'm sorry there's 18 people photo, ""small family gathering"".  ever wish anyone ill hope recover small family gathering ass. actually traveling Albany see concept. cancelled, rightfully so. certainly made plans changed yesterday. Get back spring. vaccine still available young &amp; healthy, tell knew along. much going away election day... Maybe alligator ate him. charmer! Damn wish commute 5h/week best argument ""It's required school.""  “have good” subset society “having worst”. run country, society, community.  group parents cited data said 140,000 COVID tests among teachers students since mid-October, 308 come back That's positivity rate 0.23%.

I see point. live area taken COVID rather seriously implemented pretty stringent school operating procedures. case load low schools actively managing risk, reasonable request.

That said, kids school another weeks Christmas break seems dangerous throw back communal setting right Thanksgiving Christmas. 

Tough call. May rest peace condolences

America give damn people. think care people dying? Healthcare, schooling, good jobs, etc missing minority areas. thought pandemic would change racial disparity? Actually aren’t read story. It’s plan coming next week. never went home thanksgiving college, years pandemic. friends who’s college aged children aren’t going home thanksgiving year kids less hour away. There’s certainly choice. 100%. People deal hardship well massive scale find easier deny exists. scary acknowledge we're living pandemic dangerous lot us. Also Cuomo NY getting caught inviting mom sisters Thanksgiving. calling people state ""turkeys"" follow guidelines head warnings. multihousehold gatherings us preaches. Biology geology. degrees both. 
Yeah, agree. Everything happens dependent actions individuals community. good job slowing spread, appear overreacted. bad job, know it. 
When NYC locked down, saw rapid drop daily deaths (2-3 weeks later), forced public. Trusting people right thing, own, often fails. North South Dakota experiencing surge hospitalization right now. Good. 60% US population dumb bag rocks Ive never heard I’m glad he’s ok :) Awesome! curious Quarantine impossible enforce unfortunately. managing people traveling boroughs. Given sheer amount people traveling home Thanksgiving (and presumably Christmas) rising cases Staten Island, feel great inevitable case rate surge coming winter. millions New Yorkers don’t cars, frontline medical personnel included, can’t commute get work? Brilliant idea.  think depends circle information. one can’t extrapolate personally whether it’s downplayed hyped up, won’t say anything degree.

But lack punch get spelling constant doom. can’t make people feel helpless, otherwise turn nihilistic. inevitable, even try? That’s extreme pragmatism best course imo. Never make sweeping claims, never state anything truth, seen time time again, get things wrong iterate upon them. people quite excited vaccine case, since news we’re getting positive, also remember isn’t really true happens, does, prepare accordingly. keep seeing word ‘jab’ associated vaccines. Anyone know means? Take 5+ hours week save commuting, join social club! Aus. masks + distancing + work home poss, receding ever sloooowly. actually progress serious lockdown months get zero cases. Walmart stores ill even give free disposable mask go in. 

They need security stores point. People really enjoy misbehaving Walmart. Well that's legitimately terrifying. fact Trump ""literally Hitler"" sarcastically.

But that, fact literally Nazi Germany propaganda works Americans (and amount people outside America support Trump shows would work elsewhere, too, even less people).

It honestly great insight Nazi Germany me. admit know much happened. afraid America election stuff happening know close becoming exact situation created Nazi Germany.

I think point still hold. Hanging stupid lie like that, people dying covid still denying existence, would accept shattering entire worldview order change mind. contradiction much get mad / scared yell people instead facing truth. expand worldview, continue path conspiracy upholds everything else believe.

Really, long way say cult already drank koolaid. anyone wondering post article misleading. one people interviewed tested positive virus. doctor end even cautioned get tested could due virus, even flu. Instead, headline article communicates something different.

I agree people wear masks social distance much possible, whole works. straight covid deniers go wild see misleading stuff like this, wave around like proof virus lie.

At end day, virus around year, tops. reason believe anyone suffering permanent damage, especially high percentages unless solid data shows that. people need taken seriously complications? Absolutely, nobody says shouldn't. However, again, fact remains vast majority people never die post viral complications covid. r/peopleofwalmart Unfortunately, sentiment there. close family member died initially mysterious ailment (turned combination multiple massive strokes sepsis) going on, ""at least covid"" said least one person hospital. Covid would *much*better prognosis. Probably way higher that. Expect worse XMAS NYE. Americans willing follow restrictions 8+ months accept cases/deaths come it. Unless they’re donating guess Totally agreed! Walmart customer pulls brass knuckles 

Enjoy time overcrowded jail, belligerently ignorant coward. **plans** coming next week. Jesus Christ awful take Dont forget spring loaded knifes... Gavin Newsom’s dinner party Jesus. many questions. bodies slowly buried all? families think? buried sometime - sometime mass burial. study came shows significantly reduced hospitalisation rates reduced mortality rates treatment group. X1000 time kids catch spread grandma Christmas! Effing mall ninjas... Right you. Perma-sniffles life. betting strategy work much hundreds times heard federal, state local government officials. really ridiculous tbh. blind acceptance anti-American everything disturbing. God wish re-watch Contagion. bad idea. Fully agree, hypocrisy rampant sides blame you. feel same. getting fuckin hard, like look would without covid, would dorm 4 friends, going parties every night, fun college, instead childhood home since March online classes also sucks, also going instagram seeing people dont care going parties fun.... remove areas, countries drop immensely charts Another reason general public ignoring stay home guidelines politicians. Right! Sanitize phone touching it
Change cloths.
Don't worry wallet, cuz already dirty would clean time want keep clean  doses need draconian measures control stupids. stupids must forced kill others, literally foolish live. restrictions travel within US? ‘It's potential controlling spread virus makes Oxford vaccine especially different, based early results. vaccine trials reported data vaccines perform face asymptomatic cases.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* lost? Happy provide resources. Idiotic. Forcing lines crowds. one died March toilet paper. Many people died waiting lines toilet paper. healthcare workers already antibodies would dare say. look now. Numbers control ever, distrust, misinformation...

That exactly temporary gain. better off, probably worse, thanks small part government officials squandering credibility early on. valid concern. educated person vaccine skeptic all, find explanation slightly alarming. take pains point vaccine contains virus, almost sounds like vaccine prompts body's cells start producing virus.

Not would stop getting vaccine, make realise need go learn it. Whose asking employees force employees WFH forever? think confused. request WFH pandemic limit spread optional that's exactly many large employers doing. marshmallow test, people gain nothing waiting Fuck beliefs. Facts real. Reality real. Disease real, must conquered. Since trying save humanity mandatory two weeks draconian procedures cope stupid fools, also trying save, clearly I... hate humans? Saving lives hatred?

I undone superior logic. god much smarter me. Saving people hate! know! Thank you, lord wisdom! March June felt like eternity. July went blurry blink. Agreed. cannot tolerate shit forever. guys gotta stop comparing Covid WW2 70 million died WW2, it’s level destruction death comparable COVID. Yeah I'd like give feedback two points:

1. description risks, clear know potential long term risks are. fact is, vaccines going released EUA full process. Whether proponent vaccines not, concealing ignoring fact helpful. want informed consent, consent.
2. description mRNA vaccine works also seems like intentionally dodges actual mechanism body produces spike protein. graphic addresses still somewhat vague fact body's cells recruited transcribe instructions produce protein. think that's much detail. done sentence two. Siberia's permafrost melting. article found reputable source scientists discussing viruses trapped permafrost 5 years now. know never end Anyone else PA get emergency covid alert  Early thirties. big ole man baby. Never really saw appeal ken doll YouTube teach medicine. Medcram guy seems way legit. Umm article says could mean uptick RSV doesn’t strong data flu. Baker co-authors found NPIs could lead future uptick RSV — endemic viral infection United States leading cause lower respiratory-tract infections young infants — effect pronounced Damn idea Super Mario RPG SquareSoft. explains good. agree!! People listening all. asked interpretation data 500 deaths COVID daily (about 150 directly COVID rest people diseases also COVID). want know data find it. joke. bad. really needed job couldnt fire fined £10,000 something. ""inconsistencies"" Russian vaccine actually nearly impossible get natural conditions. That's cherry picked- there's strong indicators falsification. Vaccines improve. sort extreme measures even happening right many places, surely permanent.  That's problem, people believe ""X"" happen worry dying killing someone love. happen them, end dying killing someone love. OH NO!

We letting jackass (Kiwi) Man rational rationalizing........ ass. Covid gonna spreading even idiots like traveling everywhere. Thanks, guys. Appreciate concern well-being. I'll take message heart Thanksgiving extended family. Could ol' Gramp's last Thanksgiving, we're gonna there. mean point 2 kinda applies melee weapons tho. say thing even pulled knife lmao. said, think swiss army infinitely useful daily usage self-defense scenarios brass knuckles lol Maybe care others, unlike Hitler! Calling names proves right are!
My wits outmatched superior rhetoric! people ever see that. lost job August... Still found anything yet. pretty great. public health officials, too. huge Thank heroes participating vaccine trials! Wait, that's impossible!? Trump-humping Republicans ignore covid-19 restrictions! Harumph! Though must noted percentages assume working healthcare system. (we way past 'if') collapses, mortality rate go considerably. 
 
Also, page linked last updated September 10. want nice pillow, get buckwheat pillow. empty cleaned buckwheat hulls (an agriculture by-product) filled sack; hulls never collapse years laying them, pillow stays cool, firmness/give easy adjust simply adding reducing hulls. fiance gently mocked loving pillow caught napping times tries steal it. question bay area f-ing around with, even exploring mandate. made sf center economy, tech workers come back economy jacked, jn theory.

People really know detail expand.  Dogs cats sleeping together! disaster biblical proportions! Calamity horror! Invented atrocities impossible acts authoritarianism like 'welding doors shut' apartment complexes - like could even happen. Nightmare hyperbole! Better selfish work save people yourself! Calamity! Everything overblown! Invented numbers! CATASTROPHE! tell it’s way higher. Maybe enough us forcing family members never would considered taking precautions so. even republicans, politicians--this blind spot keep seeing. i'm surrounded conscientious people agree masks distancing listen aghast horror talk someone endangering others--and turn around something like this. wild see action lack logic happening. Lol. Cuomo said going panel scientists look vaccine approval. Apparently doesn’t trust, know, SCIENTISTS approve vaccine. trusts scientists, scientists approved every vaccine beforehand. Science become political it’s dumbfounding. Anyone check bunker? idea usatodaysun.com considered Academic source. Wow reading gave second hand frustration. Especially bit women possibly pregnant. I'm 23 y/o lesbian gone premature menopause takes birth control still get asked everytime go somewhere medical ""are suuuure pregnant"". idea field hospitals high barrier entry makes sense seem close barely opened. Would people covid need vaccinated considering reckon people who've covid probably immunity Wait. 20 million end 2021? Fuck He’s member Democratic Party. media told everybody we'd walking dead bodies way grocery store back February, nobody trusts predictions anymore Wait what?

Where incivility? many gifts bought Black Friday loved ones longer us Christmas? Stay home, Thanksgiving July! think could improve second diagram, demonstration Pfizer Moderna Covid-19 vaccines work. found glancing diagrams reading surrounding text, I'm sure many people scroll look diagrams without reading main text all. 

The first diagram self-contained explanation clear language, second one throws deep end sentence ""mRNA spike protein coronavirus"" impossible learn anything know mRNA spike proteins are. 

Also, I'd suggest using less detailed non-gendered human figure instead man's silhouette. Well....are willing live world never able meet new people, travel, family parties, etc vaccines eliminating COVID? wife Humira cant take several vaccines due compromised immune system. able take mRNA vaccine? Ok hu media sure making thing up, nothing terrified of.

Can't believe people thinking that.

Well honest: thought something similar. thought would bad flu me, people age. Nope, got luck. talked people realize worst people think, quite high percentage long term problems.

So yeah chances very, very, low die even go hospital young doubt that. Days fever, zombie weeks sleeping time, bad feeling searching breath, constant headaches, diarrhea, still feeling tired one month, happens percent. sub read tons testimonies similar mine, medias time creating things like that.

One thing think would really annoying, turned was: loosing smell taste (and means virus brain btw). feel like shit, recomfort life beverage food, life depressing. think would affect much. Keep mind even manage vaccinate people 2020 -which almost certainly 5% population- protected right away. Depending vaccine used need second shot 3 4 weeks. nobody *protected* virus 2020. start acknowledging actions hurt people knowingly agree go anyway. Additionally, *DO NOT* significant mental physical illness could reasonably considered impair judgment. thought too, saw line Wine Spirits store. Google told uninformed! classic paradox. one person's action make difference? kind don't. everyone acts like do, do. aggregate individual beliefs. goes voting, climate change, protests, littering, writing politicians, etc etc etc. went supervisor asked moved. Explained situation. I'll keep ya posted. hate person bullshit. hear dying walk park, either. Apparently, dying covid like 'slowly drowning shallow bathtub beefy thug strangles make hurt more'.

I think temporary muscle pains, nausea, fever easier live with. 'live'. Living good. idea WFH norm time finish school start career really depressing. I’ll anything find employee isn’t WFH finish school. big chance sars virus mutated years become less lethal Soviet declaration war simply removed chance Soviets would willing mediate Japan Western Allies. nukings always primary reason Japan surrendered. swimmers pass usually cause multiple people die. get sick. also important understand COVID cannot keep growing exponentially forever there's limited number people planet. Aka herd immunity. brass knuckles, covid real sore messed jabroni. would need deeper dive comparing deaths per capita since March compare mitigation strategies. Unfortunately, know tracker includes timelines government interventions, deaths interventions.

As comparing per capita deaths, Worldometers lists country state level. That’s wonderful! said, lol Thank justifying choice carry concealed. Every bone body wants quit. I'm tired crying every shift. - COVID nurse. Right? can’t tell often see posts folks happy stay home nothing. Reddit miserable dude doesn’t like hanging friends seeing family. It’s sad really I'm sorry, that's awful. Read wrote again, makes sense. 
Besides, relate point making originally? Nobody going force get vaccine.

You able work large number jobs, though.  ""extreme measures"" exactly what's recommended since March many us observing scrupulously. sustainable indefinitely need endpoint. I’m gonna say despite awful is. don’t fucking care. cared, argued tried reason people (mostly family) COVID. always still take every precaution necessary public sake respect others avoid spreading COVID. said, going like school shootings. many Americans won’t budge matter they’re told recommended something, go way it. It’s like telling child can’t vegetables sudden want fucking vegetables. Fuck it! fucking cares anything anymore, go cough share silverware whatever, we’re “fuck it” country we’re going ship. don’t fucking care anymore, I’m getting finger wagged whole godamned world American anyway demonstrably proud ignorance. Fuck Sure can. tell bring onto private property vaccinated. strange want prevent people dying something ridiculously simple? 

You're ok causing people children die spreading viruses long they're people know? long something strange wear mask? 

It's strange want prevent 100 child 40,000 adult deaths every year? know worse anti-vaxer, disgusting disease spewing horrible person? perfect solution. Walmart super dangerous sometimes. Dad works can't count times he's come home sick stomach almost getting shot hurt. blessings workers deal crap daily basis. 25-30% Americans immune middle January. Thanks helping us achieve herd immunity faster, fellas. wish doctors forced work overtime save ass. mandatory top-down, federal level, citizen excused reason, severe prison sentences fines would deliberately choose stupid.  NYT article reporting *did* aggregate Brazil UK. Title ""After Admitting Mistake, AstraZeneca Faces Difficult Questions Vaccine"" months basement dwellers untill became normal even see negative consequences. I'll sitting wondering I'll ever able eat restaurant again.

Or will, they'd still never admit right.    would covid cause lose limbs though? There’s way right. know it’s personal experience, literally one know avoiding thanksgiving meal. Yeah, small gathering, one outright staying home. 

These percentages probably flip flopped Wow...hypocrisy. I'm shocked. shocked. shocked...

I feel like par course. Denver mayor traveling Thanksgiving telling people stay home Thanksgiving. Instance instance hypocrisy. Fuck anyone making direction position authority. I'm tired humans. want hear pontificating excuse making. Nobody's walking talk. Humans self-serving assholes.  Someone’s upset people post stuff reddit. Arizona here. Extrapolating last weeks, week absolutely blow away summer peak, going show data tests Thusday-Sunday.

So week past peak, plus Thanksgiving spread, next week's positive rates brutal. bs. marijuana likely become federal legal sooner later, still plenty places arrest it. doubt many sheriff's enforce mask mandates issue going person's home, finding pot plant, ruining person's life. many enforce law. enforce idea law. months declaration global pandemic-- WHO, say could possibly foresight deal now?! think know vaccine reduce R0 nothing else changes. also know mobility inevitably increase. know still reduce R0 overall practice given changes behavior. statement fact latter OP wrong about. Even campus greek housing still usually follow school rules grad students make way less 1/5 student body schools, freshmen usually numerous typically lot less people return second year start college. (Like schools around 60-70% return freshman sophomore year applying colleges) far understand, important vigilant shortness breath covid. go quickly serious situation. panic, monitor. Get help gets bad. Best wishes. Covid care obese, old, young, healthy...I've seen triathlon athletes intubated people 20s...this thing chill...it goes everyone ""You know, honey, we've rational careful covid thing really long time. I'd like forget entire day. Throw caution wind!""

""Okay, dear, 'Dare Stupid!'""

""Al Yankovic right! Next wednesday, then! We'll totally derp out!""

""Yay!"" move shocks one, least all, Palestinians. Floridians, remember incompetence election time rolls around. guy first class bozo. 30%?! That’s highly optimistic you. don’t know single person avoiding thanksgiving gathering. three times, however. wear mask times desk see anybody else wouldn't, someone could come ur desk time know directly means only, indirectly mean without. that’s thing. they’re listed coronavirus corona sunk ship speak... meaning without covid they’d still alive likely.  thought like, restaurants bars.

Obv misunderstood. Thankfully booze already Best Buy annual firing difficult customers. pick list top people cause problems legal team issue trespass notices.

Your point Walmart potentially essential makes sense. could see good attorney establishing case law cannot issue trespass notices establishment essential providing food local I’m sure partially true, took months concept asymptomatic transmission common knowledge, didn’t help official said asymptomatic transmission “extremely rare” news conference summer. general, authorities done awful job illustrating contagious Covid public. Yep. dad posts constantly telling people switch Fox News OAN NewsMax FB/Twitter Parlor whatever one is. Let's hope come back. Yup 60 million+ people recovered COVID symptoms. Totally. Good luck Thursday still comes immediately Wednesday, right? still cute ventilator tube shoved throat? I’d good look?  confused WA state make claim general population. 

Do believe reasonably apply politicians who: 

- fully informed

- openly declare risk everyone high, 

- basis, impose unprecedented restrictions work, many friends dinner with, many people one allowed home holiday

- repeatedly state failure follow restrictions directly lead deaths? 

I personally don’t think can. One problems that, even governor's mayor's push enforce mask use, police force sometimes comply. I'm CA rural area local police issued statement enforce anything related believe ""curtailing freedom."" Without someone uphold mandates/directives, teeth. demoralizing, say l east. We’re anti-intellectualism ignorance embraced country.

If, point, don’t understand importance wearing mask nothing Fauci said beginning would’ve changed anything.

You would’ve said infringing upon freedom month 1 month 12. Yeah, saw that. Deleting now. Yep, Governor Fuckhead making shit ignorant asshole now. really seen stories WFH new normal ""the way future"" pandemic ends? one hot page sub today. 

are paying attention? Ok, animal human interaction, I’ll add issues. 
Yes, interaction animals humans dirty environments bad. 
We know many documentaries show clearly markets un(der)developed parts world. 
Add though destroying animals’ habitats, thus forcing closer contact humans. 
On micro scale seen live; coyotes neighborhood since forests clear cut. 
Let’s also look @ increasing population, fed large part places farmed animal protein. 
You know better specialists track potential outbreaks animal human viruses within livestock populations. 
It isn’t matter when. 

I live somewhere large strategic amount freshwater. 
We already seen major attempts usurp us. 
I think comment previous one governor, quickly guess from. 
In case, sure fresh potable water already major commodity one wars ongoing regions world time. 

To me, rising sea level actually easiest remedy. 
Either don’t live sea, relocate. 
It really simple, solution. 
Costly? Yes. dead simple address. 

I really hope see meat protein alternatives - lab grown meat mostly - achieve beat price parity (to end consumer businesses) farmed animal protein. 
The economic moral implications great. 
I say major carnivore absolutely loves meat. insane tRumoy Fourth July ‘rally’. Dude acting like brains product millions years evolution, flip need facial communications will. treating like asperger's see stigma regarding mask-wearing, honestly one malfunctioning brain see literally zero difference socializing mask without one. Meh got one Christmas couple years ago actually really like it. long put dryer every couple months it’s pretty comfortable. best pillow world better crappy cheap pillows people seem use.  Sad true! time re-rig system. It'll difficult painful, choice end country. Clog tube turkey MAH FREEEDOOOMMMMSSS! statement currently absolutely basis. Also, wants compensation adverse effects = care. Riiiight. Well also nfl college football mlb traveling across country I'm fan either way get control require permanent body modification, injections, something similar support it.

A mask removable harm person wearing save lives thousands.

I see forced injections. one forced anything bodies without full agreement consent. body, choice.

If stupid people wear mask own, fine. Encourage them. First people question rebel new conventions. It’s really public health agencies communicate better. Maybe honest masks people would wearing instead suspecting it’s way trample rights. Speaks loudly value state fostering trust respecting public, doesn’t it? avoid creating large contrarian group refuses cooperate times crisis.

Secondly, pants don’t anything hygiene. Leading example hard? have, people start carrying shit like starting arms race. find American led panic sensationalism crazy. Experts UK seem pretty calm headed understand Oxford working MHRA months know run clinical trials. 

Nobody seen full data yet clear vaccine prevents people getting ill great news that's primary goal vaccines. 

4 million doses literally ready go UK vaccine stops people dying Oh, grown become thankful.

Thankfully I've got wine spirits right across work, I'm definitely picking bottle soon get work! Definitely. October probably absolute earliest I'd go without mask.

But think May mask mandates begin lifted. agree it, governors getting shit enforcing masks *now*, let alone at-risk people vaccinated. 300k ded = liburl hox! election! deep state! fake news! Think one hidden bosses super mario rpg ff game 300k+ excess American deaths since start pandemic. tree liberty needs watered blood age 65 preexisting conditions.

""My arm sore next day. two doses vaccine 4 weeks apart. time arm pretty sore next day besides personally experience side effects,"" Married doc.

In area high cases rules.

We 100% walk talk.

Sadly many patients not, area lousy CoVID19. least wear masks enter building. Oh FUCK SAKES. salty raised minimum wage something? game plan kill us punishment? Contrary ill-informed opinions me, believe masks work, use them. never asserted work. also believe, however, foolish charge initially say otherwise.

But go ahead tell myself. surprising. I've seen someone covid shamer literally share joint people.

People hypocrites.

Expect horrific jump covid cases December. people telling others take seriously taking seriously.

We're fucked.  Yea man. audacity people wanting see love ones relatives cooped house day months blows mind. selfish people actually friends isn’t freaking out? different definitions think Again, Public Health Agency planted idea natural herd immunity relation Sweden *themselves*. That's still topic discussion. 

Here's full email correspondence subject: (...) Meanwhile kids spread infection case ...  \[A point?/Good point?\] would speak favour keeping schools open achieve herd immunity faster.

Wake smell coffee please. later altered story things go way, mean originally plan. like guys never heard [politician all, good taste. agree. We've heard small portion survivors stories. long term effects still fully known. 12 year old niece got quit track months heart rhythm off. chest pains several EKGs finally deemed ok run. mean heart back normal know issues may heart several years now. Good read! Can't wait healthcare collapse December. almost one follow rule, including public proponents govt officials trying mandate it, perhaps dumb rule? makes realistic rules people generally - like wear mask - get lumped rules people won’t do, like don’t see family thanksgiving. makes rules seem equally overreaching, reality low cost high reward. Sounds like need police officers permanently store. Many go long even though believe it. need go hard believing real. Assault charges mean anything think justified head. people mentally well might this. Mental health still low priority many places. 

There also asshole factor asshole. would hear normally since masks getting stories them. People REALLY want kids school. watching pandemic seen change expectations since beginning March. going end eliminate lowering R&lt;1 long enough eliminate controlling borders. also point probably test everyone country find ""typhoid mary"" long-term contagious people.

That's makes response fucking stupid. Aside natural-infection immunity making elimination easier, benefit bringing pandemic end. district waited 5 days tell us exposure took place.

That's obnoxious. Good. Making sure (as opposed “encouraged”) many people vaccinated possible way end Bold assume he's got another 4 years him.   nothing indicating ""bad vaccine""; even two doses, efficacy shown 62%; well clear 50% baseline. 

The problem moment enough known data AstraZeneca pretty opaque regards 90% efficacy. need wait data released. indeed xx fool thinks proper form prevent fact body got fucked exceeding normal stresses years decades. body heals fast covers problems occurs later, decades later. Like mentioned, old men often lament stupid youth. willing keep YEARS upon YEARS? I'm not. maybe he's headed White House Trumps CovidGiving dinner people like this? Putting mask takes like half second

""But wannnaa waaaaaahhhh.  freedumb!"" Sounds awful, magic spine healing like commercial? ripoff damn.... one goes grocery stores alcohol. crazy state plates week, interstate backroads.... country full people expect happen?

IF country full people literally know anyone it... we'd done. Air cleaned HEPA filters constantly throughout flight Sounds like woes ego. Practice emotional maturity. I'm confused field hospitals never get used. I'm way virus denier; check comment history. what's going on? hear full hospitals, field hospitals often go unused. guess shortage staff, beds, hospitals full, still opening field hospitals?  trend toward hybrid. Stop fear mongering. Thank you. That's first step. Now, please consider continuing wear masks public if/when covid gets control. 

Try different masks find masks comfortable, like. Think like shirts. shirts comfortable, find ones are. 

We'd saving people's lives this. would still kill multiple orders magnitude people flu, though immunity likely also last orders magnitude longer. Another 30-40% admit lying asked they’re staying home thanksgiving. Wait, it? number people sharing air? trying downplay it?

It’s increased steadily **100 years**.

The fact decreasing significant, regardless amount. i'm talking trends, one individual article. Par course. dipshit. Leaders leading example long dead dream; hypocrisy malice rule supreme. month left me. also spicy shit still stings taste gone ate lot Except CANT work save grade. matter one bit mandatory oral presentation group partners can't put coherent sentence together save lives. punished matter well part. Yes. know considering minorities biggest victims COVID it’s weird joke. must admit understand sentiment.

A vaccine distributed population led significant drop hospitalizations deaths, yet disease still spread asymptomatically, must close business/lose job/avoid travel/stop seeing people indoors.

Once hospitalizations deaths drop, MUST end distancing masking.

I hope people rise still pushing shit 2022. USA clearly ain’t taking second wave serious enough, people still traveling like it’s normal thanksgiving. US gone see lots deaths coming sorry say happens leadership WW2 moment. Buckle *fuck* start planning victory garden really, mention form hybrid, seems employers going, good thing. Company also carefully considered wide range opinions businesses diverse games, publication, music regarding practicality work home. program finalized based considerations. enabling option monthly status changes rather establishing blanket rules regarding works home office, Company designed program highly satisfactory performing duties managing them.

This wierd reverse fear mongering part. spend quite fair bit money support partner mental health way too, started seeing reports younger people fucked life. Checkout 13 minute Tons around, you’ll find lot more.

Not steep claims - 100% true. watched campaign rock roll real time. much fake info spread nuts. Main push: Masks don’t work. Masks take freedom. Masks make pass lack oxygen. Masks don’t stop virus. name it. went wild countless thousands posts.

Bottom line: huge part US population fell false claims hook, line, sinker. protests.

Watch greatest hack think protests fueled... 

There much larger games played here. ROC Orange Zone, right? Don’t schools close? partner mental issues. tough. takes toll me. worse thing medication side effects difficult get it. agree this, could see people using reasoning having/going gatherings, least smaller ones precautions taken.

""My family completely locked outside grabbing groceries doorstep mortgage/lease place recirculated air. Family another household same. we're risk anyway, together."" 

I'm saying that's smart, I'm saying that's lot people might finagle statement.

I'm sure I'll catch complete hell (or COVID) saying this, parents boyfriend's mother visiting us tomorrow Thanksgiving. boyfriend's dad sister invited, recently traveled back Florida (whyyy) taken consider minimal precautions. boyfriend, mom, mom, dad quarantined 2 weeks, guests, received negative test results.

I've struggling lot longer two weeks now, heck could tell they'd probably still show anyway. I'll struggling long time after.

The problem lot people good gray areas. time gray areas. I've always problems black white, nothing sort person. good lot nuanced situations. However, I'm outlier here, seems like lot people really embracing gray areas. Well, people sub. lotsss people. 

Go ahead, worst. I'm horrible family-murdering monster. still don’t understand obsession masks. offer negligible protection best. think recommendation wear can’t harm however don’t much good either.  Something tells basimg assumption real life experience. Thanks reminding majority Reddit populated children  several articles covid infections general consistent study. See reference section. idea virus could hitch ride lungs particulate matter adds yet another reason masks important. muh rites ""Avoid drunk driving, can!"" Yup. CEO’s easier find entire hospital staff. 'Rona Ron Death-Santis afford wait quit? 
If can, please consider it. WILDCAT NURSES STRIKE LETS FUCKING GO I'm going bother engaging someone argues bad faith. I'll repeat main point question, acknowledge 300k+ excess deaths occurred US since start pandemic believe numbers made up? 

And, follow question, willing recognize number fact think leaves morally 300k+ excess American deaths nbd you? Nobody thread _joking_ 2,100 dead single day, asshole. Nobody making light it. They’re _referencing_ Homer scene _accurately describes public health situation_ we’re currently facing. much better lockdown states like Illinois doesn’t fit narrative I'd avoid families views impact health seriously dont understand ""do visit"" restrictions.

If mother dying Covid, shouldnt able hold hand stroke head? die alone? severe, able catch situations summer.

Man fear mongering bs. Dude able socialize 8 months. Masks huge barrier meeting people. know subreddit scoffs idea talking strangers, fucking miss it, absolutely can't wait masks go away never come back. Masks ""barely inconvenience."" They're huge barrier basic human interaction. Wait. saying human pollution impact world around us?

I'm shocked! /s Trolls gonna troll wonder work people able get vaccine due health reasons. talking Anti-vaxxers, legitimate allergies. instance, many people can't get flu vaccine egg allergies since flu vaccine made chicken eggs. Oh really? That’s interesting. thought used live resin 2130 last night. (There, fucked folks, went somewhere thanksgiving).

Absolutely massive grocery store maybe 20 people it. didn’t even panic attack. Let guess links people connected Swedish sTRaTaGU saying herd immunity strategy.

You seem labour belief need link enough instances someone unrelated Swedish strategy using words herd immunity somehow make proof. really bubble situation... tip hat Zen-like advice. 

Mr ""I've instructed staff enforce mask wearing"" (who almost certainly work site) making poor decision. people learned November what's up, really change minds? Everyone personally talked get first round. want rushed vaccine... also Modernas hailed cure side effects bad. big rebellion forced get like flu vaccine. experiment, pawn pandemic, martyr, used abused along fellow nurses hospital staff. vaccine made fast truly know short long term effects. I’m vaccine covid. rushed vaccine forced upon medical staff. Despite lack PPE ever changing rules based lack PPE safe thus far continue take proper precautions. it’s nice covid deniers could wake maskless people mask up... would help more. even medical community, coworkers disregard social distancing mask wearing guidelines it’s going long butt quarantine lot deaths... ATM live UK. discussion vaccinations starting healthcare workers elderly starting late December ... maybe. would accurate compare Sweden neighboring countries countries similar culture society, social distancing non-generational households norm. compare Sweden Finland, Norway, Denmark painfully obvious much failure Swedish approach been. Pole I'm surprised come 43% think govt fine least average. total mess.   Yeah understandable, way see UK US expecting normal April/May expect June here. gotta remember Canada signed many producers J&amp;J Novavax also work we’ll orders 5 functioning vaccines, even don’t get December doses Pfizer/Moderna lot vaccines rapidly increase supply Q2 2021. 

Also we’re still getting 6M doses Moderna Pfizer starting January anyways. news really playing sides coin, reporting doses we’ll get January also making vague report “other countries get first!!!!!!”. Like yeah shit, expect US use initial doses first starting supply us? also incentive supply us considering we’re one largest trading partners Post update curious stop person Imagine bragging body insecurities embracing coping mechanism. Idk hear whole lot cushy ass programmers bragging “I haven’t walked outside front door since March”

They ones complaining many essential workers, realizing takes grocery clerks nurses keep cozy little world running I'm terrified hand get starting next week.

Is worth life watch Mom chew dry turkey? Good luck firing self employed :) so...don't visit Poland bit? Immunity can't *at least* x months that's absolute term. average. never tell people essentially guaranteeing minimum amount immunity. always tell average. hard rule follow I'm definitely right. 


It matter know exact average amounts months, still average.

It might 6 months average immunity might 12 months average immunity, **it's always going average!!!!**

It's hard, stop saying words least say word average sudden statement misleading inaccurate.

You're literally misinforming people say something like immunity least 6 months.

Especially right now, lot people vaccines going figure average length immunity even was!

Also case understand, average immunity 12 months still ex percent lose immunity per month.

Even average immunity 12 months, people lose immunity first month, people lose immunity second month, even people lose minute third month forth achieve average immunity 12 months given population would also include people go beyond 12 months immunity.

This average means! democrats like Schumer partied streets Biden’s win supported BLM protests?  I’m loving able hide face world leave house.

r/averageredditor think health care professionals want even deaths whilst strike Man I'm confused accusing now, said factors included. realize I'm original commenter replied right? blinded rage people disagree with? USA heard Florida Governor dropped covid restrictions across state back. thought meant free state glad see article local governments still restrictions. deaths next two weeks, calm thne deaths Thanksgiving idiots. five, may 15 grand? Sounds cheaper expected, like I’m average dude feel like could save months get one really wanted. Textbook example “you lead horse water, can’t make drink.” reference *is* joke dense, obtuse fuck Sweden huge death lag. wait weeks see accurate death numbers. looks like deaths always decreasing. Meanwhile significant stating "" there's one dying orange county,why stuff closed, get money covid patients, ECT ect.."" im.."" sorry that's works DRG payments, yes get ecmo contact that's new, know nurses reviewing bills want nursing notes ecmo"" God paid medical bills 40 plus years friends still there. know doing! I'm happy actually go BACK work Office paying different bills hear day. I'm taking precautions. He's 74 year old, overweight c.o.p.d person. not.  That's think every time see yet another anti-Ossoff commercial. JON OSSOFF TOOK DIRTY MONEY TROY TERRORIST SYMPATHIZERS COMMUNIST CHINESE GOVERNMENT. Um, no, assholes, company made anti-sex-trafficking documentary shown China, government owns large part everything, including media. company got $5000 airing fees. far fucking cry DIRTY MONEY, DIRTIER AGENDA. THAT'S JON OSSOFF. 

Loeffler also big ol' party dredging old footage frienziedly cutting together context make seem bad possible. I'm getting real tired assbags claiming Democratic candidates want leftist things, problem leftists candidates actually refusing outright endorse leftist ideas. (Why dance around issue? They'll accuse socialist communism matter do, guys! Go energize base!)

I really want official election watchdog agency exist whose job fine everloving fuck candidate, campaign PAC/superPAC catch bending truth badly. 

(Local news unbearable Georgia months. please publicly funded elections get endless money politics stop ungodly ad buys? could build damn house mailers I've gotten. FFS DNC go fuck cactus giving phone number every single political organization state.)

This got topic real fast. But, y'all, enraging waste money demonstrates broken elections are. nothing 2007 2008? two weeks, right? I've updated comment proof now. statements Tom Britton adding context. Grammerly friend. Cool. Let deal dead family instead. Much better.

*Everything* going ""more month before"".  Yeah get _reference_, asked who’s _joking_. Egocentrically Ny nj still far highest deaths per capita nationally. dakotas highest deaths moment. probably shouldn’t gone field then. Every dipshit making ""so far"" joke reference [The clever comment back March. old played now. would think would opposite, there’s light end tunnel hold hunker months. nope it’s like first Frontline workers higher risk people get vaccinations mid December restrictions go window. multidose, take weeks kick in, going take even Frontline workers higher risk receive it. remember totals high mostly NYC. gonna get lot worse gets better.

Hard sub believe you’re bunch neckbeard programmers left house month pre covid, unless you’re programmer get groceries dropped front door (and incredibly strict sanitize quarantine protocol all) everything right still get sick. perfect, it’s literally unattainable. minimize much possible.

...are also first cry big free-market company says “You need vaccine we’ll fire you.”  #tinFoil ploy reduce financial burden government support folks generations come. Nah, don’t wanna take experimental/rushed shit. always gruesome, mostly carnage.

There's least 300k excess deaths USA year. That's 100 9/11s. can't wrap head around number. 

If took one step per person died far, would need walk 140 miles, walk mile day keep up. I’m exhausted hospital admitted people realizing serious is. people exception elderly stopped taking seriously 
No restriction mitigate unfortunately Remember last spring break? late. Czech Polish, confirm word humour languages. /s I'm Canada available April think. seems anything. far tell warned I've near single COVID case yet I've running since came out.

There enough people using apps yet. forget blatant immunity could thus also relevant Sweden.

I’m pretty sure they’re safe immune-compromised since contain viral material. said favor business owners making rules. case, health inspection would never happen run sorts dangerous situations due lack sanitary standards.

So I'm saying since ok businesses making rules, anti-health inspection anti-sanitary standards.

Business allowed make health rules did, people would get sick lot contaminated food. think something.  think something. entirely true, pretty dumb statement tbh. course aid package needed, absence it, businesses stuck rock hard place. understand feel best course action given circumstances stay open strict protocols place hope best.

Also private gatherings easy set regulations Covid spreading, understand there's much harping it. sucks, also falls Govt creating situation feels unsafe people even small gatherings people outside households. isn’t seniors FL golden goose, since rich retired boomers you’re self-employed, complaining about? you’re unwilling pay Covid vaccines employees? someone become piece shit? like man literally shred decency entire being. don’t know kind employment - company flu clinic every year.

Nobody’s forcing get plane. Yea, government incapable anything whole healthcare system used rudimentary analysis made 19yr old (I know previous school btw). gathered data individual entities saw completely different official bullshit. Well, yesterday made covert nobody calculate anything, within govermential agenda.

But dead never lies. Death toll going higher higher every day suddenly we've come 25000cases/300 deaths 15000cases/650deaths per day. Totally believable... president audacity reject German help offer reasons (we need help nazis, would we, proud nation), meanwhile people die home room.

And also milions zlotys (1USD ~ 3.80 Polish zlotys) lost shady ex-gun dealer, ex-head healthcare wife's firm on... fucking parody, actually absolutely correct. Even miraculous approval relief bill, probably wouldnt happen Biden sworn in. Even falter senate GOP demands ridiculous inclusions tax breaks... etc. assuming senate flip blue, course. 
 
In end, finally pass, far late damage done. mean ... there’s lots things done. third country still thinks hoax, half state governors pretending business usual won’t take hospitals calls don’t want hear bad news, federal government clearly given point. nationwide travel shutdown would taken state federal cooperation, huge bailout package airlines hemorrhaging money point. Fore record Americans used spell things properly. one Noah Webster fucked caused problems live day.

[Noah Webster's American Dictionary English Noah! still can't get people, respirator, disbelief real. stay home instead venturing outside get test time...?

Shed less contact people. Seems really counter productive. fine friend actaully Covid knew going kept testing positive.

But imagine get Covid, get asymptomatic dont notice it.

Then finish it. 2 months later test.

I might still trigger positive, right?

So would tell go home quarantine, even though longer sick.

And would contact trace call people met previous 2 weeks. cough fever whatever (in flu season!) told possible Covid case also told stay home, right?

Meanwhile .. *nobody* infectious, old previous unknown infection still setting positives.

It seems major issue sure isnt talked more?  This. home schooling kid Aug 2021. experiment failed. telling people wearing masks prevents faces recorded governmental face recognition system Obama Hillary Clinton worked together secretly enact obtuse buffoonery allowed sub either. Also, consider deleting comment calls asshole civility issue. get situation dire stating egregious meant insult country humanity whole. line humans need learn cross. welfare children paramount.

But even want use term directly public might react. good idea Hi, me. I'm listening. Oh thats good. Thanks reply. Yep. People read headlines articles. read assume emotional language tone rather try understand process facts figures.

American media really done wonders programming americans believe exceptional others far worse even though reality opposite.

In east asia, use language like 'total war declared government COVID' set mass test lockdown entire cities discover dozen cases one cluster.

That's problem. pandemic slow people see water rising even standing chest deep. looking back months realize water knee height.

""Breaking news, countries continue act like fucking morons continue massive deaths. Idiots claim idea people dying, swear figure who's behind covid hoax global media conspiracy surrounding it. News 5."" Umm, wasnt US expecting vaccinate 20 million people 2020? wearing mask encourages others same. everyone came email explaining reasoning wearing mask. people virus covid hoax camp pretend got already.

So wrong ability spread virus directly, contributing spread.  That’s whataboutism. scope Imperial genocide China directly relates imperial genocide China.

Yes no. Why? Ignoring Covid think Poland seems nice country. ontop fact *other drugs thing* better suited task lowering inflamation: namely ibuprofen. improved treatment happens hospitals staff operating ""normal""  Interesting, learned something new.

I also think preparation needs taken next epidemic/pandemic. Majority countries I'll prepared. Locking - step one. there, takes one airline flight bring here. says article Baylor, one named places plan make mandatory, already makes flu vaccine mandatory. valid points I’m well aware of. also consider. I’m well education studied criminal activity big pharma, haven’t done homework items suggested. need research vaccine compounds science behind vaccine makeup. help know ones concern long term health vs safe base 200 year scientific knowledge compounds work body. 

Don’t spit bullshit haven’t done homework. totally agree, see peak COVID deaths 6 weeks so, 5000 dead day impossibility US healthcare systems go stated previous comment difference holiday period backtracking now. I'm expanding comment talked people coming back Pakistan etc. least likely outcome 50 least likely outcome. 

I'm sure reasonable afraid nonsense. lot effective vaccines like confer lasting immunity, needing booster shot like 10 years so.

The immune system confer lasting immunity coronaviruses. way get control vaccinate everyone next year come back 6 months later booster.

That enough get R0 1 finally epidemic die (there still probably endemic outbreaks enough vaccine conferred herd immunity, locally contained). think EU power enforce anything like that. Poland independent nation set whatever covid policy want. effectiveness
Vaccine effectiveness describes well vaccine offers protection target disease real world, rather controlled clinical trial. Vaccine trials usually include healthy volunteers, often don’t tell us well vaccine works children, elderly people, compromised immune systems.
Reported vaccine efficacies 90-95%, we’ve heard recently, may sound impressive. However, real-world conditions, vaccines likely offer much less protection population groups. kind weird 8 months ago laughed people talked forced vaccinations New World Orders, everybody get vaccine participate Great Reset. major wave already happening. 

Then next month (thanksgiving, christmas) going sharknado tsunami top current tidal wave. Good luck sheriff enforcing fine. Nothing talk can't enforced. Yeah, I’m there, guess don’t see protecting people less important economy, seems ultimate point “the side.” seem willing sacrifice hundreds thousands people keep things “normal.” Maybe stop trying make sense nonsensical takes.

CFR also rise hospitals overwhelmed patients severe cases lose access life saving interventions supplemental oxygen ventilation. Someone please tell I'm wrong. bit uncanny strategy, coronavirus, typically immunity lasts \~6 months, let spread.

It'll take longer 6 months spread everyone therefore keep infecting people.

The sound strategy social distancing safe vaccination rollout. Well, hopefully takes gene pool vs people celebrate massive groups go work them.

I've going supermarket necessary medical appointments, shit, Thanksgiving I'm gonna afraid go anywhere. going catastrophic. people can't eat fucking turkey people live with.  think meant say VI team get smoked Alabama experts said knew vaccine efficacy. done like spring. One clear takeaway: many available interventions work, mask mandates stand effectiveness relative lack economic tradeoffs. “Mandatory mask policies seem effective policies higher costs,” says Tookes. (Simply recommending masks, Spiegel notes, “doesn’t anything.”) fact, instituting mask mandate reduces county’s future fatality growth rate 12%—about same, isolation, disruptive measures including stay-at-home orders closing restaurants.

I'm sure like worded binary choice. Sounds like two options would double fine. Speaking which, time skim paper can't tell analysis meant magnitudes additive analyzed individually. 12% reduction mandate masks add top reduction elements? linked?  guess since I've read econometrics look appendix tables paper page 35 36 almost seems like average temperature and/or cold weekends pretty good indicators compared policy interventions. skimmed quickly.

The people got Covid, ""fought better"" somehow?

It seems like try ""hold Covid away"", gets going end first ""hit"" takes old vulnerable. Fair enough. 

However. Adding extra contact going get tested multiple times (and potentially closer lot people suspect Covid) seems silly unless experiencing symptoms someone Covid. Thats plan lol. 

I plan case things go pear-shaped. Personally think everyone should, especially live frozen landlocked states.

People get fairly sick virus call ""flu."" people proper influenza infection years. had, say things like ""just flu."" comments, ""you great job, thank leaving Fl open! Happy Thanksgiving you, family!"" "" BEST GOVERNOR EVER! Thank shutting down"" ""Good job Governor! people like state locked down!""   I'm cherry picking comments, every comment FB page like that’s one sub understands people gathering. vast majority people feel life worth living see others person. time things, added financial psychological strain last months. Oh also holiday season.

This bode well. wondered well. would thought CDC would ready start meeting HOUR application approval sent in. 

I think year something waiting additional data patients vaccine still got Covid. number dead dying would important that. They've tested LOT people. wish made URGENT thing lives. 

I know probably complexity I'm aware of. wish would let us know they're taking long meeting.

Can anyone explain? 15 people getting sick means gathering probably quite bit 15 one sub going family thanksgiving? previous comments looks like arguing yourself, lol.

I dont think so.

Someone said vaccinations dont protect unless everybody gets them.

Do agree statement? I'm thinking might want talk someone - sounds depression hating job, especially since would never consider getting different job. Alaska’s extensive data collection know 19% infected Pacific Islanders Hawai‘ians end hospital 

Whoa that's scary. Yeah construction workers large don’t give shit. much machismo industry. mean hell, can’t even get blue collar coworkers wear ear protection somehow deaf makes manly. federal government send 6.4 million doses pfizer vaccine within 24 hours explanation Apple/Google contact tracing system works without risking Wow, that's crazy sad. None tje residents probably make this, even staff. Wow. point it’s excessively careful, like weren’t. 

Working outside home risk. would visit family.

Maybe that, maybe wasn’t. know weren’t letting guard one day. like book. Duh!  family gathering worth risking lives. would straight tell family thanks coming. makes sense given current climate. People leaving Fox feel Fox doing. anyone telling to.  right, going biggest aggregate impact. also hardest ""cancel"". 

Had rally cancelled would virtually eliminated huge migration intermingling one fell swoop. going go see mom dad wife kids. sister kids. 12 people total, refuse ashamed that. Ukraine still country, even though lost Crimea Russia, still claim it. Taiwan currency military. PRC authority control Taiwan. I’m glad daughter home you. “we” referring family people reading thread? can’t tell you’re simply describing situation advocating others gather tomorrow. I’ve yet see single article heralding Kaua‘i’s incredibly unique virtually covid free status. Instead motivated mainland remain unaware us ponder move New Zealand.

You evidence Alaska, Tahiti, Bahamas, destinations make clear single preflight test let much covid eventually result community spread.

From Alaska’s extensive data collection know 19% infected Pacific Islanders Hawai‘ians end hospital – twice group. also know least 3 1,000 travelers infected missed single preflight test. suspect close reading data soon show even higher. hygienist going overblown like cool, feel safe right now. That's mentioned sterilizing vs. non-sterilizing immunity. Given previous comments looks like arguing yourself, lol. Cringe ""cancel"" thing. strategy — aimed allowing exposure virus **in order build immunity** among general population protecting high-risk groups like elderly

They made part.

I'd take part seriously would saying Sweden herd immunity strategy. think terms math. Giving someone already covid vaccine isn’t going save life. ship sailed. 

You need ~70% population get vaccine (or Covid long term immunity) reach herd immunity. say roughly 70% number throw around lot obviously spread correlate negatively % vaccinated you’ll see benefit reach 70%. 

So makes sense distribute based population need 70% population every state get vaccine (or covid, again). Theoretically, spread bad one area like SD could send even less vaccines proportionally get 70% antibodies/B cells/T cells. least short term natural Covid-caught immunity wears off. someone asymptomatic. Covid could picked quite literally everywhere - lot people understanding that. Perhaps pumped gas going - sanitize wash hands SURPRISE: Covid! think trust regards services provide human human level without need authorative figure tell us right wrong. would prefer pay someone tell right wrong, rather trust good people. statement nothing masks coronavirus. lack character humility. level community spread we're seeing worst-case scenario communities like South Dakota? admittedly, living life ""as normal"". comparing with? Massachusetts, New York much higher deaths rates. I'm confused mean, Link #2 Puntmann, et al. two sources link #1 below, unrelated Puntmann's come similar conclusions though see confusing. Link #3 mentions cardio involvement flu prevalence 0-10%. IFR higher Covid19. Cardio involvement far higher Covid19. Long-term respiratory symptoms higher Covid19 wonder saying far dangerous qualified point?

It shows Covid-19 causing inflammation systems outside respiratory system would explain strokes, increased MIs, etc. Even manifest MI, shows detectable changes heart post-covid majority patients. stretch think affect brain since inflammation brain one proposed mechanisms memory issues flu.

But yes, symptoms often involve respiratory systems post-Covid, also fairly ""guy"" Infection Control Doctor one regions.

Swedes tell us regions actually responsibility putting place measures related public health FHM acts sort adviser.

Besides, makes think *infection control doctor* decided strategy was, rather simply informing people advised FHM? Good point, I’ll try get back results Dont worry make Tik Tok videos showing much time hands. Rubbing self importance everybody else's faces! like teachers!

Have respect word ""essential"". Nobody cares cashier, line cook, table server. people tired too. Legislator individual law-maker, legislature body legislators 100% board types policies. coming someone said, im taking vaccine first 6 months, year releases. anti-vaxxer means, want peace mind large sample size long term effects played out.

My mom works research testing major pharmaceutical company. Ive seen soo many drugs killed stage long-term side effects popped up. ill give time.  


With said widely available needs re-integration rules like made standard. Un-vaccinated people need continue practice quarantining social distancing indefinitely. Absolutely nothing wrong that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also wouldnt mind seeing removal federal assisted medical benefits vaccinated span year vaccines available like flu.  Many societies mask respiratory viruses flu season. culturally accepted US I, one, hope practice continues least among individuals showing symptoms.

Secondly, Measles great comparison. Truly one contagious viruses there, insane reproductive number 60. Like SARS-CoV-2's relatively low IFR still myriad long-term symptoms following Measles infection, especially among children vulnerable virus. Except holidays we're going into. Please state vaccine process expedited way could compromise results? Also please point side effects significant enough cause alarm (specifically long lasting irreversible side effects)? that, legitimacy, otherwise, long winded rant. way avoid giving others to... get it. defeatist attitude bullshit. Alright, alright, i\`ll admit.

Im officially tired winning, please let rest world attention ok? contemplating day. Good read. extremely careful, took mask getting hair done. Next day hairdresser started showing symptoms tested positive. ended getting well friend clients too. Fortunately, symptoms pretty mild. 4 days quarantine, won’t going anywhere I’m completely symptom free. fatigue worst part. won’t making mistake taking mask again. hope everyone family 12 recovers complications.

Lmao name whataboutism comment trying say?

The Japanese actively engaged ethnic cleansing atrocities aspired empire scale Nazis did. indisputable historical fact, reality American imperialism shitty change fact (or even really place new light). Censorship big tech disgrace, 1984 Anders Nystedt goal herd immunity, locally set goal, also talked Public Health Agency, national Both. probably primarily something came Public Health communicated Swedish Public Health remember discussed media. Several actors. think first saw article former state epidemiologist Annika Linde. many talked curves graphs everywhere. Statistics-Britton often call. remember saw Public Health Authority document.

He apparently confused, worrying itself. formatting exactly wrong article?

*“In major parts Sweden, around Stockholm, reached plateau (in new cases) we’re already seeing effect herd immunity weeks’ time we’ll see even effects that. rest country, situation stable,” Dr. Anders Tegnell, chief epidemiologist Sweden’s Public Health Agency, told CNBC Tuesday.*

Do think they've fabricated quote?

Sweden chose strategy goal herd immunity infection.

A Herd immunity strategy, may. maybe lies ok, analogy case, certainly top infectious disease expert (if actually knowingly lied) source also state trying decrease infection low possible,

You need understand something. say != it. depends position, suppose. example, last job required lot travel negotiated things made travel easier: individual business credit card, ability book hotel flights wanted (within reason, course, first class everywhere). also guaranteed office, flexibility working hours, payment moving expenses. position also fairly rural operation negotiated deal let go whatever reason (except theft criminal activity, course) would get six months severance give time find new job move family again, caveat soon found position severance would end. 

Just stuff like that. could get away lot requirements position specific many suitable applicants. position basically take gave great negotiating position. Yeah low chance. Extremely low. Measure risk commonsense terms. You’re acting like Amount stuff stay safe I’m central Ca, lockdown. “curfew” sheriff already said wouldn’t anything curfew mask mandates. We’re doomed. actually one called LYMErix, pulled market mostly unfounded safety fears (it came shortly infamous wakefeild study). Well let's take several hundreds thousands skill workers push wages raise house prices. Little world, little mind. Maybe US. I'm voluntary, cause rejected basically. guess that's going change, wich, might good thing. testing area drive thru. don’t contact people waiting test. Yep. That's like people claim can't lose weight despite eating 800 calories day, actually observe them, put ranch everything chug soda day long. cognitive dissonance, plain simple. post absolutely peak reddit. exactly mean ""Pack Black Friday doorbusters!""? projection spread misinformation ironic small businesses supported communities keeping employees, customers, brave frontline workers safe, made us proud call Michigan home. must continue part help small businesses survive ongoing pandemic thrive long ended. urge Michiganders smart stay safe head holiday season. beat virus spring listening medical experts, flu causes 8 times higher risk children Covid. It’s Justizverwaltung opposite elderly 
That already well established fact. children flu Poland ? cant vaccinated people still carry virus give people? Well, that's disappointing. guess use full face respirator p100 filters. I've around people would test positive virus. appears respirator job I'm sick. world becomes BSL-3 lab mess around inferior PPE? dumb point? Washing lettuce probably low enough pareto chart infection risks work outside home. lol exactly Australia NZ isolated? UK isolated island too, right? fuck badly?

Also restrictions set lifted next week Australia, people don’t even wear masks since contained virus. restrictions talking about, specifically? hope whatever making angry subsides find peace. CoNsTiTuTiOnAl RiGhTs you’ve ever travelled developing nations totally normal. might misunderstanding numbers. Either way, horrific. :( Lol see post history comments mostly removed __incivility__. probably realize shadowbanned subreddits comment in. Hope next one!

(boomerism mindset adapted to) going avoid giving others 17 people together inside Thanksgiving? may pushed hoax angle, Americans sure willing eat shit, despite professionals warning dangers. trump problem, US wide problem. x^10 called polynomial, 10^x called exponential. True! Dead serious, I'm obsessed emotional vomit look science. 

It clear lives dies.  relate. would divorce spouse different opinion Covid you?! fuck sakes. really going pretty far way pretend understand arguing against

What heck?

Someone said ""What right get infected someone""

And said ""Thats *you* get vaccination"". protect you, right?

And someone said ""You dont understand vaccinations work. truly protect enough people around also took it.""

But wrong, isnt it?

Vaccines ""truly"" protect virus 90-95% time.

Maybe ""100%"", even everybody vaccinated around vaccinated maybe one 5% doesnt work for.

I dont understand issue is?

People telling ""I dont understand"". 

What understanding? people chronic heart lung problems see schools condemning child lifetime health issues.  Texas too. Yeehaw. mainly psychedelics ecstacy/mdma. definitely Berlin, closed Christmas markets, left regular markets open. They're exactly same, attract crowd sizes.

It might oversight, pretty silly regardless. Yes, does.

Tell me, two strategies involve herd immunity:

1) Use tracking tracing determine everyone exposed virus quarantined prevent spreading virus people. necessary declare total quarantine tracking tracing keep up, keep place level infection drops low enough tracking tracing work.

2) bother tracking tracing, even widespread testing. Instead recommend people showing symptoms stay home. Meanwhile, tell people exposed infected people try stay home, employer approves. Oh children still go school (without masks) .

The goal Sweden **slow** spread, **stop** it.

Any strategy based stopping spread default ""herd immunity"" strategy, epidemic end. mean truly taking every precaution gotten sick. Someone group lied something traveling / visiting get sick first place [Wear Mask, Wear fkn selfish. Medical workers must feel abused point. see, since reasonable, logical response pointing flaws idea businesses able do, resort weird poop insult.

Go back read wrote, responses, maybe think bit.

You'll understand eventually. hope. love stats people! Looks like USA going number 1 forever. Also sure trolling know enough SARS-CoV-2 compare rate mutation influenza. talking about? Link shut it. Imagining things actually happening align personal agendas seems common among skeptics. agree you. person replying implying cases past peak Iowa things get better. Like say, unlikely. I'm done you. I’m LA. Business usual aside bullshit restrictions one follows Sad. assumptions (about allergies) used big deal 2020. screw lot lives. honest opinion countless records long term issues? That’s flu lots mutating season season. Yes keeps telling state ministers citizens social distance, stay home etc... telling much... need orders, suggestions. Best example: America masks, mask mandate long time lot places, many people ignored it. mandatory, people needed wear mask, would get sanctioned. Bears fan, here. Kind glad rest country watch ""offense"" work Thanksgiving. I'll take everything said face value assume genuine. I'm former person myself, I'll make analogy. Oxford University, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna, companies (and university) like Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, Cisco, Dell, HP medicine. employ legions scientists post doctoral degrees kind work. top regulatory bodies several nations also reviewing data approving anything. 

Here's analogy: someone background question amount scientific medical knowledge professional expertise within organizations analogous non people want us install hotfixes security patches computers systems. Microsoft says remote execution exploit whatever version Windows everyone running Cisco says need update iOS router it, let layman business finance person stop looked ""information"" think see conflicts. person must understand annoying laypeople argue topics know significantly do. think researches fucking Oxford university Doctor devoted entire life fighting diseases NIH would feel response person saying ""well fix technology, looked information think need vaccine"". imagine would roll eyes hard find someone tried download RAM. kind thing going happen whenever let virus run roughshod entire country.

Low odds low, zero. Even .0005% chance hit someone 12,000,000 cases. issue also comes funding. governments fund vaccines necessarily need moment? Covid worldwide effort massive amounts attention funding, hopefully carry less popular diseases still affect people lot. know UK could’ve easily closed border, right?

But you’re right. fucked didn’t lock late. I’m using two examples. Vietnam even better. Thailand well. Cambodia well. China well. Singapore looking like go back normal next month too. I’ve given two western countries lot Asian countries because, believe not, world’s population Asia. P.S. Let freedom reign Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

Even seconds. opinion. one person going care hard lockdown, relationship erode quickly. Agreed weird they’re able that! time older (who remote learning) got cold gave younger (who in-person). get cold?!? doesn’t go anywhere! I'm totally new here. I've mom last week told feel comfortable attending Thanksgiving. hour away, could drive, indoors anywhere 13-20 people 5 different households. tell it, told we're coming. guilt trip UNREAL I'm grown adult family. hope I'm making right decision. Thank fighting fight like warrior are! I’m healthcare worker would tapped March already. I’ll remember post next time I’m mood wear mask. I’ll put damn thing keep inner mouth shut. 

I wish coworkers best. What's going hard people grasp numbers end December going Jan.

The vaccine hit hospital staff first responders end year, according CDC. chances Jan public know vaccine approved begun rolling out. since death numbers delayed much, daily deaths continue rise.

So people confronted two bits factual yet misleading information. vaccine administered deaths continue climb. people able process properly. Good point Yep even people generally social conscious stupid. I've watched laws engage reckless behavior simultaneously saying they're careful. Spoiler: they're not. family. hard get them. think they're fine overblown. cheers progressive governors closing economies without support massive amount unemployed people they're creating!

Looking Seattle!! fun :) Ah, insults! must felt good, telling internet stranger, methodically pointed errors frankly ridiculous strawman arguments, lack character humility. can't argue facts, attack person!
You're living fantasy world. People horrible care harm inflict around them. reason governing bodies exist people what's best others, what's best (in selfish little worlds)


So favor abolishing health standards businesses? That's keep saying, nobody needs authority tell right wrong, completely false. example sanitary standards restaurants stands.

This people's lives. sitting here, arguing people allowed endanger health people 'people choice'

No. That's works. right endanger others selfishness. Arguing local federal government public health orders simply showing empathy compassion fellow humans, value business profits human lives. all. challenged apparent belief pursued unconditional surrender Japan, provided reason not. atrocities Japan provided support pursued unconditional surrender. Wow. Great link. eye opening compared stuff I’ve reading. Thanks posting. That’s fair. 

I don’t think US ever eliminate virus, long get cases manageable numbers, large percentage folks vaccinated, I’m fine repealing mask mandates. Yeah people somehow ignore fact Trump got $600,000 first class treatment drugs even available general public. Idk ignore that, do. bring extremely valid point pays stay extremely safe right now. idea true long-term effects. Pieces puzzle starting emerge infected months ago. Another area I’m keeping eye scientific (not media) standpoint. No, many people scared conspiracy theories, anti vax issue though contribute spreading misinformation past vaccines. think regulations good. need impose penalties people don’t follow them. mention I’m NY plenty regulations, many people don’t care anymore.

My whole point people need think consequences every action, don’t necessarily agree everything said. censoring reasonable post states nothing politics written doctors Harvard, Oxford Stanford. much reliable could possibly be? Angela Merkel keeps telling unfortunately state leaders won’t budge. Still transphobic Upvoted I’m curious too. Sorry answer virus likely made way gathering one family member whose job required work outside home, Aragonez said. family member attended event symptoms thought allergies.

According account event published by the Washington Post, family members intend gather indoors but fell back old habits, including wearing masks, as ate cake fajitas. hypocrites subreddit probably justifying travel holiday gatherings. Anti-vaxxers kicked Australia too. ofcourse Texas (a State notably HIGH population stupidity)...🙄 Oh know depression. caused work. catch-22 situation.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* counted tests new cases. number tests equal number cases plus negative tests. Prepare another lockdown ugh

People blame governors anyways ugh Hospitals allow employees refuse flu vaccine. know mine doesn't. Basic science medical knowledge part job. GoOd LoOkInG gEt ReEleCtEd correct. know second hand smoke is? also abundantly clear seasonal stopped ravaging Sweden heated without much social distancing.

Actually, think combination warmer weather \*and\* increased social distancing. Social distancing easier summer could dinners social gatherings outside, restaurants outdoor seating etc. Sure outdoor restaurants quite crowded, virus spread nearly easily outdoors. Even inside, probably left lots windows doors open increased airflow.

Then autumn hit, people started spending time indoors, schools returned in-person teaching, people went walking biking using public transport, time, colder weather also made easier virus spread. wonder cases deaths increasing again. actual fuck going America. insane. many levels. probably worst pay sub? Surely you’re pulling leg?!? 

If would looking immigrate moving liberal state least. 9 residents 20% die 10 days. It’s terribly sad. 25-30% people honest. Current estimate among former current healthcare workers I’ve talked to: early February 2021. Sign doc! I’ll gladly test tube vaccine. hope good reason confident analysis

Of course don't, statistically significant

That's official press release used 70% 90% filtered days later popular journalism Totally agree, Midwest checking 🤦🏻‍♂️ We're discussing morality atomic bombs ... bombing civilians. guys whatabouting thread saying ""What Japanese atrocities."" Well leave profession. Getting vaccinated everything part job. personally think benefit. got first healthcare job got Hep C vaccine happy worry (that much) Hep C. can't necessarily jump myocarditis MI, part problem here. true COVID19 unprecedented long-term impacts heart metric people discussing post-viral illness. can't base comparing two viral diseases ""it stretch think inflammation could problem elsewhere"". Lung cancer contagious. Poland still relatively low death count per capita. fashionable point fingers country currently worse. think well 2nd wave hit everyone heavily time stop playing particular game. Check death per capita country, may well still higher Poland. Stop putting links title. bothers patients regarded ""recovered"" official counts.

If recovery hope stay far away covid illness possible. serious question? grocery store recently? pharmacy? hair salon? restaurant? Passed government building? Nearly every public-facing boss telling employees come back work public. Even masks required employees, often aren’t enforced customers. Hundreds customers day x Y% unmasked = fuckton exposure people “different opinion” could get someone killed, dipshit.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

The ones think they're invincible, ones think big deal. luxury staying home, also luxury visit family judge essential workers so? I'm

Even directly applicable you, that's pretty much implication saying. Add top truth must essential workers paid far less us get sit butts home, another element class privilege serves fuck us end. read article traveling nurses costing upwards 10k week. Last time NY issue rest country available. states overwhelmed longer simple building field hospital. Although NY pay enough lure nurse away; means nurse helping/saving life place.

We many sick people; needed ""flatten curve"" avoid this
 Field hospials solution 85k+ people hospitalized Covid guess already death row, whatcha got lose. I’m trying defend going friends shit, I’ve also similar anecdotal experiences op, I’ve roughly 10 friends got it, don’t think go hospital (tbh tried kill alcohol s/) ya I’m college student. make pretty good effort staying inside usually roommate girlfriend. know lot kids age stopped caring seems like minor flu them. understand point, pandemic sucks. proposed solution, besides saying ""fuck it, die, die""? Pressure economy big... government guts it. That’s fair. It’s rampant sub misrepresent facts even doom gloom. comment upvoted top days ago predicted overall deaths using IFR 2%, double even pessimistic sources predict. 

COVID incredibly bad, especially US. One doesn’t need use blatant falsehoods prove point, truth enough. think that's enough people time....good luck! die callousness haunt them.Holidays next year year too.We technology keep touch . Honestly surprised means least 50% people heed warning. read stories one actually tested positive Covid... 78 year old woman. (or doctors) ""guess"" it. 27 year old dude simply said ""confirmed covid long hauler"", OK how?? lol Also, please read Dr. Gerald Evans end comes studying presentation long-term symptoms, Dr. Gerald Evans, chair division infectious diseases Queen’s University Kingston Health Sciences Centre, said **it’ll important distinguish who’ve truly infected COVID-19 there’s evidence they’ve ever people haven’t received official coronavirus diagnosis observing long-term effects, Stevens said **they get serological test, measures antibodies bloodstream associated becomes tricky lot symptoms people reporting terribly specific — things like trouble concentrating, headache, brain fog,” said. **“These symptoms number things well.”**

I think honestly fearmongering. virus already bad enough need kind nonsense. Cuz us spread .. 10s thousands people already are. know ""everyone"" say masked retail environment far less likely sick end day unmasked social environment eating food table. still go Black Friday, year. madness.

Most big retailers DOORBUSTER SAVINGS people acting like herd animals climbing top one another escape predator burst doors fight $40 tvs year, instead online deals month. think many people go. SAID, big brain people probably think ""this year! one pandemic!"" people, literally worst people country, still show up, even though really level sales normal years. flying Australia New Zealand hours long flight regardless land mass you’re coming from? Travel UK back convenient couple European countries. England less hour France. Lmao. 

They fucked implementing bad strategy genuinely believing people would really forgo interacting other. keep using two golden examples end day, that’s have. hundreds countries. statistics favor. It’s bad strategy. overwhelming majority time, don’t work. I’ve rough year I’m probably making clearly, I’m sorry that.

My point even silly stuff, could still get sick. intentionally absurd example

So treating someone like it’s inherently fault got sick based feeling fact. everything right still unlucky.  wont Guinea pig already 44k guinea pigs gotten Pfizer vaccine, wont even able get vaccine probably March/April due age health. know memory clinics are? see either sure downvoted. someone link? hoped would understand Australia map. Lol Please link them. think they're showing impact three separate infected individuals. Irony Bowl Sorry peasants, Dow hit 30k, soup you. - White house Back March first lockdown pretty great. like 10-20 new cases day. hope new lockdown helps. sucks. medical worker caught Covid taking care patients back May, hard pill swallow. I’m leaving hospital work different environment fuck people; sucks. essential worker murky definition hope class better. ""essential worker"" excused curfews etc... I'm sure need getting vaccine first. counted tests new cases.

It seems depend state?

Here say count multiple positives multiple cases.

According [this *dont* count multiple postives, end video says sometimes do.

So doesnt seem consistent all. again, say know lot people made sound like they're ""laying low"" Thanksgiving whatever, come find they're actually going see parents siblings someone's house. ""know family also careful"" 10 people, technically guidelines live. I'm like, FFS, might 10 people FIVE different households, dude. increasing risk bigtime. 

I've also heard several friends lately someone family caught even know got it. People left house go grocery store doctor appointment getting it. that's happens even wear masks MANY PEOPLE IT. going get worse next weeks. Again??? affects them, sure problem.

But get Covid, spread people. Wearing mask isnt protecting yourself, protecting others.

Their selfishness getting people killed. read follow-up says informed strategy, rather made himself? That's things get really bad. accept things bad get temporary relief. relief last stuck bad. positive time? DeSantis demented. Exactly, feeling people way over-dramatizing sub. course, saying neglect basic measures, example, wearing mask indoors limit pubs/bars/restaurants. I,myself, wear mask indoor public spaces, went two vacations (within country course (Bulgaria)),saw friends there, basically safety measures place whole period fortunately nothing happened. Then, went two different weddings back September, nothing happened (fortunately). 

However, recently sister flying back Austria tested positive days later. Fortunately, nothing happened little syptoms.

One members family job required leave house. went party thought C19 symptoms allergies. dad tested positive covid morning, got asshole boss wedding 200+ people recently. least mom tested negative now. far serious symptoms, beyond pissed fucking idiots like boss. sure ME/CFS. Jury still measurable physical damage. probably ME/CFS I'm betting measurable lung, heart, brain damage. lmao thank exactly want fucking do? Please god tell me. people batty. Seems Sheriff's Office focused vehicular traffic setting checkpoints vehicles out-of-state plates among 5 exempt states. assume people fly region initially questioned PAPD, sure pass info along Sheriff's Office, NYPD, keep it.

The Sheriff bust sex club day:

- Australia 5k Aud Lucky family isn’t getting together. family could care less despite telling bad idea is. Yes, everyone read understand strategy herd immunity, put trolls business Okay, well. That's pretty obviously poor choice, wow.  again, one cares interact. virtually restrictions Florida zero healthcare collapse. Georgia, Texas; people care. Lockdown lockdown, entire point viable strategy. outside two isolated land masses, overwhelming majority Eurocentric ideologically centered countries legally anything that. don’t work. fun spending mental health care. Lol I’ve said piece. I’ll wait next moronic comment continue. See ya next time 😍 source usual one way tell us herd immunity strategy? ^ mental gymnastics. 🧠🤸‍♀️ Initially, quite few. would behave better (not universally) probably create good peer pressure. sounds believable health care plan  Q: eat restaurant can't Thanksgiving?

A: ""With people work small businesses set fail en masse, America landed current contradiction: Tell people it’s safe return bars restaurants spend money inside following often useless restrictions, also tell **it’s unsafe gather home, nothing sale.**"" \[emphasis added\] I've years what's another 4 months. least excuse time.   know two people saw two DIFFERENT dentists issue. though dental school harder get medical school, guess means think smarter. reposting old shit said turn true? mention posting way tell us strategy herd immunity going happen especially help financial help federal government Money, community pressure, state DOE pressure guesses. even that. lag time 3-4 weeks good relative comparison summer peak, effect ~80k daily infections. think expect 5k+ daily deaths January. posted science-oriented coronavirus sub today suggests lethality *lower* strains mutations.

The sample size unfortunately small, promising. frustrating thing family right now. wife page, family not. like say take thing seriously, immediately talk something risky, like going 40+ person event dinner party 15+ people different city inside small apartment. talking x-mas get together lockdown starts again. sucks avoid them, especially daughter almost 2, refuse part. worst part act like asshole taking seriously do. Yeah 130,000 pool deaths past month, people still allowed swim. 🤔

People lack number comprehension impossible reason with.  won’t let government tell can’t inside home let tell can’t go families.  Oh damn, pandemic still going on. would thought. /s school district refuses go back remote even cases rise community routinely students/teachers sent home symptoms. I, classroom teacher, choice take unpaid leave though Christmas try protect family. It’s crazy! allowed without mask, parties/tables least 6 feet apart, parties limited 6 people, people must remain seated unless they're going bathroom, point must wearing mask.

and yet restaurants bars still one largest sources coronavirus spread, [along workplaces like meatpacking plants warehouses, institutional settings like prisons retirement complaint inconsistent messaging. we're big thanksgiving dinner would dumb that. i'm flying travelling state, would also dumb. government officials allowing restaurants/bars remain open, despite knowing gigantic risks pose, simultaneously saying avoid thanksgiving gatherings risks pose, very, poor messaging  need look Thanksgiving light healthy safe.

No, need live reality century pandemic gathering thanksgiving like driving drunk. one spreads non zero chance gets spread kills others didn’t consent reckless gathering. 

Would feel like guilty piece shit happened? so, maybe take thanksgiving off. not, sociopathic disrespecting douchebag. 🖖😷 flu much accepted safe. Every year there's drives get everyone vaccinated. Every year every pharmacy grocery around signs begging people get Free Flu Shot. lucky half population gets one.

When last time people lost jobs, thousands businesses closed down, widespread shutdowns, shelter place orders, lost many people flu?

Comparing Covid flu nonsense. ICUs beds week two now. They're keeping patients ERs. ERs also starting run beds. going get back next two weeks.  😂😂😂. Go on, keep making look like moron. Anyone click link read quote see wrong. general ineptitude pretty funny though. r/iamverysmart would think things would magically get better January? I’ve seen numbers US Europe and... sorry say it’s looking good. Bill Gates bad history vaccination programs under-developed countries. constantly called population reduction. behind moderna vaccine end #1 candidate. wanted goto restaurant reviews said restaurant bad dirty etc, would still want eat there? That’s I’m saying. didn’t ever call population reduction, didn’t sponsor failed vaccination campaigns maybe people would trust vaccine. Look happened Polio vaccine. can’t roll let us without questioning them. problem media bed media ownership 2 -3 families Bill Gates part families. Basically nobody has. generally outliers. Fortunately.


Still scary Yep, argument getgo could lead civil unrest could fracture country point. We’re country billions. We’re overpopulated is. ever say *mild shock* necessarily. know family caught totally lockdown. exposures doorstep grocery delivery possibly air circulation apartment. follow guidelines vastly reduce risk, can't 100% eliminate risk. hell wrong lmao fact either legal actual problem. Apparently haven’t learned lesson, Christmas....that’s sure. smoke enough weed know absolutely worse way brain go Go run pal surprised employer discouraged it. What's oaan? I'm big fan ""rice beans cheap!"" line.

Sure, would want thing eat, every day, day day? I'm vegetarian say authority easy get tired it. would want option. shit bidens gonna responsible huge drop cases. /s US celebrating Thanksgiving tomorrow; arguably biggest holiday everyone gathers family across country. Expect levels Xmas. OP one misread article Japanese news source American one. 

Japan’s hospitals average (without Covid) 70% (80% - 

That 25% occupancy rate Covid patients crisis. state unemployment system, yes. much going move goal post previous comment said unemployment benefits need help putting right people guide resources right places beat things like this.

We past years.

January better. Nah I’m going go sit car 8 hours Thanksgiving nothing open visit places eat.

Then ‘safe’, I’ll return five people openly exposed someone positive.

That makes ton sense. First, thank discussion.

Isn’t entire point traveling nurses? talking infrastructure staff. physically larger building contingency beds rooms personally don’t see huge expense, maybe I’m overlooking something. Yes equipment would bit cost, insane.

Maybe mandated US government regulations. “Must 15% extra beds compared average maximum occupancy per year” already require nuclear power plants kinds stuff name safety, thing air travel. feel like done due government scared cost increase.

The fact medical costs US aren’t remotely cheap. think get pay for. don’t think it’s much ask bit extra infrastructure. money going?(I realize that’s different discussion probably it’s still frustrating)

I also realize arguing barn door horse already ran away, think it’s absurd medical costs high country hospital system seems almost ran like airline bus service want full overloaded patients. 

Also really haven’t discussed “ICU bed occupancy projection tool” AHA website. It’s linked last comment.I see one state 90%. GA. see one state 80%, IL. IMHE overestimated past. Good luck enforcing curfew, especially talking Texas went school kicked out. Normally winter holidays thanksgiving, think school year adjusted year end around thanksgiving. think old college people campus let people live campus semester. don’t think arguing catching yellow fever isn’t worse catching covid, yellow fever kills lot fewer people covid right since yellow fever vaccine covid vaccine. know yellow fever kill far fewer people covid year don’t know numbers like yellow fever pre-vaccine. Obviously yellow fever worse disease catch far far fewer people catch it. Agreed! studied immunology UT studying virus huge blessing far safety little family. I’m actually 35 weeks pregnant second round COVID in-laws older kids; it’s huge deal husband I. requiring everyone covid testing quarantine week seeing baby I’m sure that’s actually going help. think based evidence would safest wait vaccine available everyone. careful. husbands family live giant red bubble infection near Houston, TX. Things getting crazy here. hire security guard dumbass. employer, responsibility keep employees safe. South Bend, Ind.-based Beacon Health System one hospitals report 27 COVID-19-related deaths far month, grim record faced earlier virus stages.

Oh no, one person day dying COVID...the horrah! im sitting wondering arent dragging rich politicians streets TX here, metro area. wife teacher they're bullshit hybrid system--some classes like 20 kids there. Masks mandatory students, like case, teachers wear they're room without students. 

Cases continuing increase area, governor, state DOE, many superintendents taken Lord Farquaad approach: ""Some may die, sacrifice willing make."" “Will cause crisis”. There, fixed them. “It’s worse yet.”

This single strand, positive sense RNA virus. It’s matter “if” “when” virus mutate inconvenient way us. Hopefully it’s long time now. sure point article is. Six degrees separations...

Works ways seems Lol fuck even radical centrism? ""tell wife said hello"" Wow, mess. Thanks posting it.

BTW trouble link (even though Wired account) used [archive link](http://archive.vn/lWQ4h) others might find useful. going 17-person thanksgiving dinner? forced, voluntary. Certain things privileges, rights. want fly, need vaccinated. Yeah less 1% infected actually die. White House task force calls people change behavior White House spent last 6 months downplaying severity pandemic, telling people case numbers merely artifact testing, pushing snake oil cures? Shout OG's remember SquareSoft. mom dad still know anyone town 500 virus problem anti-trump news.  Dealing country full people expect happen?  Guess always get larger numbers.

Heck employers would okay acceptable losses older employees older (age seniority) employees cost due healthcare premiums wages. went averaging around 200 cases per day Ontario, Canada. ..to averaging 1500 per day. fairly sure Thanksgiving October 11th mainly blame. Diwali last week expect another huge exponential jump next weeks.  Don’t employees :) freelancer. know nurse Twitter day talking people demanding know “ really wrong “ hurling abuse point jntubabted ... shocking...THEY STILL THOUGHT HOAX :/ immediately turned something political.

Mask wearing, caring other, understanding things work, science made political.

We tired right get-go, things made political. kiss 2024 chances good bye.  way win national level record. Relevant: combination things happening. March thought death rate would 3-6% result public really hunker down. Also federal government passed stimulus help took pressure many people. Almost 9 months latter death rate around 1% public tired told live life's cares big UK’s tourism numbers then, logic? brings back point conveniently ignore - shut borders? cdc study differentiate indoor outdoor dining didn’t include Los Angeles specifically. going destroy industry holidays, need specific evidence back up. huge backlash already. going parents place. dont ever traditional holiday food anymore regular meal. Say ~2% death rate, that’s 40,000 deaths incoming. absolutely true everyone needs wear mask. excusing people don't; fact, think sociopath don't!

However, point especially, really need shift perspective. Masks 6ft distancing public nowhere near enough. Even universal compliance, we'd still doomed. People need stop gathering, even little bit.

If seeing friends family indoors, all, point, substantially contributing problem, pat back absolute minimum possible wearing mask. people going unemployment getting assistance right shutdowns I'm young. I'm 40s went spring nyc. Something whole world watched happen somehow rules apply them. seen family year got married zoom. make sacrifices. seattle place everyone becoming unemployed without assistance governor shutting down? say 'fuck poor people' seattle?  People selfish even realize. want want, want holiday tradition year can’t comprehend getting want best strategy right now. It’s sad really generations choice drafted brutal wars around globe, generation can’t even sacrifice rather small, temporary things life. Perhaps many people take granted good it. think important first step address combat propaganda misinformation nationwide scale. needs done transparent reputable fashion look Baltic States solutions. Public messaging continues terrible US. Every scientist know save one two skeptical what’s happening FDA. Ok Hitler.


Maybe check nearest mental health clinic. governors shutdown entire industries state without support losing jobs. surge pandemic. holidays. only. kidding? Right?

Masked masked transmission low percent. means someone walking around without mask work. Remindme! 

Six months biggest beef aren’t stuff that’s free. Masking basically free. Setting chairs maintain distancing free. Canceling certain unwise things free.  Going zoom instead person meetings free.  

On board sit constantly questioning still physical meetings are, aren’t set largest room available chairs least 6 feet apart mentioning masks need stay way meeting.  

Instead it’s 8-12 people room hour two sit long table 3-4 feet apart people wear masks way sit take off.  zoom option available greater % people taking advantage it.  aren’t baffled thinking talking precautions what’s big deal. 

Last week someone attendance without mask audacity ask thought inherently close quarters (impossible apply coronavirus mitigation strategies) part program oversee might ready resume indoors January.  told chance. 100% no. ruling ideology lot Republicans wage lot democrats “market knows best”. States left devices regarding PPE, competing FEMA states. idea competing one another secure best outcome exactly ideology market, forced upon states pandemic life saving equipment. 

We never really shut down, managed expectations last 30 years government shouldn’t (but can) things people. Back Easter year people talking crisis isn’t bad need make sacrifices (so grandma dies ?) economy. managed expectations paternalistic brow beating unemployment making people return work, cut suffer along path normalcy.

It’s pure market ideology way, entire family sick. Dad high fever coughing mom lost sense smell. agree saying we've reached point control. However masks work, would help slow virus's acceleration. much better big businesses either outside lucky benefited this. Neither I? control behavior, yet.. yet cold &amp; flu still mostly spread winter even TX, FL, AZ, right?

And TX, FL, AZ outbreaks went steep decline July, way end summer misery (and, IIRC, TX&amp;FL explicitly refusing reintro restrictions).

Also, Northern California far less miserable summer yet got outbreak July..

It's hard fit seasonality-is-the-driving-factor. know that. blow vaccine released. airlines like money, eventually stop enforcing this. issue mRNA vaccines, nobody seen full dataset we’re moving ahead approvals drugs injected hundreds millions Americans. Maybe incredible results representative way understanding based what’s released serious questions remain, can’t answered unusual trial design we’re seeing drugs.

These vaccines treated like breakthrough cancer treatments that’s unusual. thing happened BC - teachers gearing hybrid style teaching kids essential workers full time class education ministry decided - without consulting teachers - instead would full time, 5 days week.

Our cases aren’t anywhere near bad, spread province 5 million, half live one metro area seeing highest level infections ever school still chugging along. New Jersey US government could coordinate execute national response instead leaving individual states manage own. never shut airlines first place True, also lots terrible legislation like NLCB. could also use additional federal funding nationwide help things like nationwide pre-k program, etc; extra money states find recruit talented teachers. Lots things national government do, refuses so. cares big tourism numbers normal year are? Lol planned trips caveat arrival hassle. lot travel involved matter you’re coming from. people travel European countries like it’s run grocery store. Like what? 😂 “Will”. There, fixed them. think majority swedes telling everyone herd immunity strat is, denying it. mother 86 years old. Fuck whole ""well, old people"" bullshit. OLD PEOPLE STILL HUMAN BEINGS FAMILIES LOVE THEM. Maybe that's needs happen instead slowly ripping band-aid off. What's scary looks like half US.  100K 900K, that’s still two *thousand* people dead *in one day*.

Where *exactly* glass half full perspective here? Luckily many vaccines. BioNTek (developed Germany) one choice think.

But always go Putins Chinese one. reaction that? saying state Washington suspended whole unemployment program? would national news. would true?

Yeah pretty much. go grocery week two that's pretty much people see. remain top comment. Well case state legislature actively preventing governor anything. actions past 8 months undo restrictions put place governor.

So case extremely hard it.  Lol wonder country fucked over. Thats probably thing lot people died said. lot people said kids family members die Good know informed public health experts.  watched towers collapse citizens screaming horror.

Nah telling tell grandpa life isn’t worth living die. That’s all. promoting honesty see grandpa would feel that’s all. Maybe something point huh?

Problem solved. Thank you. Local health department maybe try airport/airline? Except even know try. world means try. 
It might take 2 years make facility capable producing 100 doses. important things know going rants much failed. best friends parents doctors think masks don’t anything Officer Officer *does* certain ring it. wear gators already said like wearing masks all. candle blow test. can’t blow candle paper mask on. might thinking oxford, promised 300 mln doses US (not end year, might floated head) live Boston seen maybe 5 people without mask indoors since March. go work almost every week, walking around Boston weekends. days look people commute see maybe 1 person hundreds without mask outside. guess different city, people taking seriously make sure pay attention time.

Skipping thanksgiving roommate left go thanksgiving... worst thing Canadians sheep won’t punish govt dramatically f**ked appear better neighbors south. hey least get pop vaccinated 6 months ours... news ? go rural SuperCenter see many (or more) without masks morning. lab test positivity rate creeping 10%. SMH Look data. past peak hospitals fine, what's evidence suggest New York style ""collapse"" even technically collapse hospitals hit capacity USS Comfort field hospital set Central Park remained mostly empty? Wow, know that. donors rural Alberta, would elect stick painted blue. I‘ve learned can‘t stop stupid. Stupid finds way. There‘s nothing people don’t listen police don‘t enforce bans. Well, either companies flatly lied found two weeks- bold move part much foresight involved- people charge logistics solidify plans there's mad scramble even plan vaccines get approved.

Seems pretty simple tbh Wow. So, people happy, then? loved ones called home? 

What cured people? rejected? What’s like chicken wife? House bill intentionally designed pass Senate, Democrats allied media blame GOP harming America.

This kind bullshit happens time two Houses Congress controlled party. Also low pay + high cost living. Canada losing lots brilliant STEM workers that. Perfectly reasonable request. get fight Wawa Florida, pants fall expose third eye world see. I’d agree. read something yesterday’s travel numbers around 3 million bring 50% last year. depends exposure time. 30 minutes? 18C below. 15 minutes? 11C below. 5 minutes? Anything freezing. nothing resilient able wear mask. know who's resilient? Citizens Wuhan, citizens Melbourne. isolation 10 days onset symptoms. I'd imagine local Health Department contact shortly. What's stunning number days? 3000 day? 5000 day? 10,000 would stunning guess. Can't see getting high. Healthcare services becoming overwhelmed already baked current number new infections many areas country (it approximately 12 days new infection reported hospitalization patient reported).

What means CANNOT count critical medical care available loved ones (for reason) twelve days now. death rate Covid serious illnesses increase. Americans dying home, waiting rooms, hallways etc., please stay home.

Try get even better mask can't stay home (like KN95) instead cloth loose surgical masks allow mask make feel invincible. Even everyone masking distanced try best minimize time spent sharing air people outside household.

Many people essential workers reasons choice. makes doubly important us stay home so. Joe rogan still pushing it. Yeah hell Singapore know containing COVID? /s

0 COVID deaths July - Sept  hope changes soon. take pleasure seeing US either. separate entity rely employers stuff.

you mean like health insurance?

the health insurance would pay covid hospital bill Ford people get sick?

&amp;#x200B;

this altruistic.

100k freezers... vs... hospital bills, ventilators therapeutics?

&amp;#x200B;

no brainer. complaint would Texas amount covid cases nation yet doesnt want take serious action shouldnt feel need take first dose. 2 year program generous. Try 1 year program become LPN! sister dropped college got 1 year nursing certificate. job title still ""nurse""! Can't say fuck Christmas one year. What's going worse Christmas memory, postponing Christmas one year murdering grandparents? ugly, stinking, worthless, garbage, scumbag, pieces *hit still freaking wear masks, loved one dying, A-ok government wealthy business owners! *ucking hate world. Same. one tells ""smile"" more! Health Dept playing whack mole law enforcement actually enforces mask mandate. first couple 5 digit fines, anti-mask businesses became grudging mask-necessary businesses. shitty surgical paper masks give sense security; treat people like they're wearing mask -- six feet times.  Well, stayed well MN, IA, IL, MI, months restrictions lifted. can't really guess things would gone without initial safer-at-home. (Maybe things would total fine without it, idk.)

What sucks Evers can't restrictions clearly need them. State legislature defined infection level Evers would allowed take action. Never partner part essential workers group may getting vaccine earlier would able to. questions two dose vaccines. 

Once take first dose, technically covid positive? spread virus? Would need worried living take first dose?

Also, happens take first dose second dose? city earth eliminate major second wave, I'd describe pathetic. symptoms 2 week quarantine. afterwards would sort workout higher intensities harder breath shitting bricks got result back. Literally even small cough I’d think ima die. Scared shitless whole 2 weeks

There go, typical PTSD. beyond everyone downplaying naysaying PTSD (shock syndrome). really dial fearmongering. case I've heard about. idiots OANN Newsmax directly trying incite civil war domestic terrorism constant stream conspiracy laden lies. need go. problem ever right wing leaning news source long factual information. groups intentionally squirting lighter fluid Democracy. I'd like see everyone associated criminally charged extremists act (from point) based telling them. Biden exact way, different rich buddies, platform relies fucking American people. can't sell ""Hope"" ""Change"" people need them. Good. Fuck OANN... Fuckin state propaganda bullshit news. Sure, feckless stupidity got far life, change horses midstream? 500 top 1750 undergrad clinical hours, saying programs unstandardized ridiculous NCLEX-RN exam requirement every state two major accrediting bodies two major certifying bodies. program meet NCLEX pass rate requirements graduates quickly lose accreditation. online RN programs I'm aware entire country online NP programs require in-person clinical hours. know tough spot. Generally best give people encourage abuse health professionals states. point step back worry family. States step give 24/7 security detail. ever conclusively decide whether person obese means vaccine effective them? choose to. That’s kicker isn’t it? Nobody twisting arms go nursing. Generally, no, US, yes. unique obsession individual liberties everything else guarantees people won’t make socially conscience choice. Everywhere else successfully contained communitarian cultural values. exact black white thinking see much holds merit me. 

Protect yourself, wear mask gunna live life. 

But cancelling elective surgery? Absolutely idiotic. happened happen ever again. Oh know oligarchs sympathize democrat party. Maybe need homework. Like least looking major owners American media.

I mention Trump. would I. mention Hillary Clinton either. problem monopolistic fascist big tech teaming democrat party. current figurehead party. better censored republicans. agree could misleading plateau still data.  people they'll pass grocery store, airplane home... zero me. Like barely know got it. even arm pain. explain places self limited lien 5% versus self limited 60% say person used work lab infectious substances get audited regularly see everyone keeping safe.

Nobody, even highly trained scientists executes safety procedures 100% correctly 100% time. bad part time don’t realize you’re careless one specific aspect. don’t realize it.

So back us situation. People going think execute safety situations perfectly protected. reality many people right compromised people knowingly didn’t follow protocol don’t report etc... safest thing everyone-you especially elderly parents stay home. light tunnel obviously there—the vaccines approved week two. 2-4 months. There’s need risk we’re close end. 😰 I've heard short term nausea really it. I'm Australian dad retired 83 full time medical consultant. yes, vary lot people get lot done 65 85.  wife told grandma's 94 year old family friend assisted living facility almost two years nurse worked pressuring grandma aunt (both high risk age) go visit friend. grandma ripped nurse playing sister's kindness. 

Some medical workers need removed medical field certainly put health safety first. first line get vaccine, it’s disingenuous say months trials would show longer term effects. Edit add: it’s accurate say urgency pandemic accept time -limited efficacy safety trials. first line get vaccine, it’s disingenuous say months trials would show longer term effects. Surgical masks effective preventing spread droplets cloth masks one East southeast Asian countries. It’s like parallel universe. last doubled around Sept 23 probably true, assuming growth rate cases. Fridge cold gonna result roll first world countries one doesn’t require refrigeration. massive cold storage infrastructure easily adjusted keep vaccines. also small. One cold storage warehouse could hold worlds supply easily. keep one place won’t need ton room them. years later new york stock exchange went bananas. Oh years later WWII broke out. want honest answer? 😩 propaganda template, get that? Good idea, won’t work method... data dynamic. adjust date 4 hours, day, 7 days, month, year, etc. Tracking hand excel sheet way day - see areas moving look trends past couple weeks.

For example, Hawaii last state US doesn’t controllable spread. Yet, past week high list people searching tests. interesting see I’m next weeks begin climb well.

This method incredibly accurate. takes time build data fir couple weeks, tracking areas interest daily. crystal ball areas pop. Data little wonky traveling, thanksgiving back normal... starting 21-30 days out, boom. guarantee US light like never people searching tests. It’s level 1 spread - it’s get thanksgiving spread X number people, level 2, continues build.

It news everywhere lines countless states people wanting get tested. Level 1 spread bump needle 7-15 days out, it’s level 2 folks really move needle... well levels 3, 4, 5.... accurate. why.

People sub want excuse continue excuse nothing day still feel great it.

Enjoy dinner inlaws. Well looks like people traveling anyway problem No, quarantine time arrived. NY test provision 3 days, makes safer, fool proof given high rate false negatives, possibility bad collection, etc. Safest would arrive, quarantine 14 days.  Well still could hit truck drive there. gotta reread books again, updoot There's risk catching clothes even without wash Thanking police despite behaviour past year pretty pathetic. doesn’t change things I’m rooting us here. work VA currently. It’s amazing wear masks, somehow wearing one isn’t ‘infringing rights’. VA actually beginning accept civilians since local hospitals nearing capacity. Bullshit administration right isn’t helping anyone communities drowning. many months take set domestic production vaccine? No, vaccine contain virus, impossible get infected become infectious it. may symptoms like fatigue fever immune system trained mount response.

If get first dose second dose, vaccine would less effective. Exactly much less effective really known point.  Japan good like put Japan top Taiwan Australia better far fewer new domestic cases Japan now. Thank link. I'd wager low Vitamin levels. ****! can, wont  take anti inflammatory. shitty first days trying tough out, convinced something gone wrong. Took advil right back business. Exactly. think seen person without mask month. mask wearing much good people meet private wear them. getting COVID? seems asking good faith. loaded question would like, ""what thoughts short-/long-term side effects multiple dosaging"" Putting article like behind paywall despicable. definitely disapprove victory parties sure.

I fear county went protest Inslee. Ugh. badly want live? Yeah I'm sure would execute right hopped plane haha, like 19% Saudi Arabia irreligious 5% atheist. mean ideally we’re supposed eat public since there’s safe way it.

I'm planning congregating others symptoms, would waste important medical supplies personal peace mind? Wtf thought testing free. Yeah I'm paying test vaccine. government needs pay costs 100 percent I’ll wait old school vaccine that’s still clinical trials relies well known virus targets delivery methods.

You're alone. difference Oz essentially virus free right now. packed stadiums state-of-origin rugby games past month. Spain, wearing masks forever. makes difference. still got hit hard. Wearing masks outside makes difference people go sit restaurant eat dinner.

Masks reduce spread eliminate it. Locking worst hit neighbourhoods saved us. sucks ass people health district without would imploded. masks mean nothing people hang privately Thank parents parents resources might better able go pre-pandemic childbirth plans **parents color** parents fewer resources, lost earnings jobs pandemic.""

Again, would invite people consider family something could potential harm kill them...let alone financial impacts. even wedding middle pandemic???

Like said, definition family...then much say. love family would never something intentionally put lives risk. pure insanity people can't temporarily inconvenience protect family. get kind selfishness thank goodness anyone like family...we take care other.

I'm going lie wedding party Ohio got 3 dozen people sick...and felt zero empathy all. CNN starts rolling story story Christmas so-called family infected Thanksgiving, I'm going feel zero empathy. many times people warned...and yet they're gonna whatever selfish thing want anything risk family's lives. clearly, care...why anyone else?

The people truly feel respect sympathy point amazing nurses doctors manage treat people. I'm sure would want help anyone even bother miss one holiday postpone wedding save family. I'd personally rather quit endanger life family's lives save someone who's much asshole. I'm sure hospital staff hanging point...and even Thanksgiving yet. Christmas, bodies piling trucks country.

But hey, brother cool new wife get want, matters right? get it? Lol read zoom hangout. getting back? short drive I'd go risk low. #OR MORE!! necessarily live Manchester airport (UK) considerably less flights Rural Americans going get vaccine. won’t wear masks, definitely won’t get shots. week?! forever?  another fool richly rewarded.

Desantis wants convert Disney World Covid World No. True, still show excess mortality figures. suspect infected death numbers revised quite ways upwards. pretend NY. Apparently Cuomo kills old people OK. wearing glasses wearing mask wrong way think of?

If former wear bandaid nose part prevent moisture fogging glasses may reason seeing eye infections. want believe. that's CDC director played part political sockpuppet year long, almost never stood White House. 2020, CDC completely utterly destroyed lifetime credibility. [kick Pfizer's vaccine actually developed BioNTech, 2 years slithly bigger Moderna. Pfizer involved clinical trials manufacturing technology. No, government want spend money people already made med school want extra competition driving pay. agree. First medical professionals said didn’t wear masks. said would fine schools open since kids spread it. also said quarantine 14 days, 10, decreased again. things telling us fits narrative. wanted save masks, let’s tell everyone don’t need them. want kids school, parents work help economy. less time quarantine need health care professionals back work. Nope... trusting this. believe vaccinating, makes little nervous. say aren’t BSing us again. pretend new york. apparently nobody cares cuomo kills old people. Test supplies harder get case numbers rise. wouldn’t want take test someone needs symptoms exposure. like want western media pick footages exaggerating clickbait story according Reuter report one case Shanghai 22 Tianjin.

But video above, yes, guardian, make tiles : Chaos Shanghai airport ""thousands employees tested covid 19"". make headline: ""panic Shanghai airport new covid case found"" make headline like above, read closely see ""Chaos Shanghai airport thousands employees tested POSITIVE covid 19"" make thought new outbreak happening China. clickbaity misleading. tape mask bridge nose.

No idea much would cost language forms though.

[Wiki generally right plenty doctors practicing top hospitals decade post undergrad training. there's definitely range intelligence even among doctors. Unfortunately lay person, really hard know judge whether someone good doctor, often go things like went school, necessarily great indicators. really enforcing 'only one two households together' rule? States, similar restrictions state state basis, rarely enforced. 

Some Sheriffs even said enforce them. leaves people make wisest decisions. course many aren't. Finland done amazing job.  believe trial run. report bugs system right Christmas think first medical personnel get shots. Making masks state art RNA vaccines scale difficulty guess. suppose flip switch tire maker vaccine maker  vaccine politicized start. rushed, hasty vaccine deserves second, independent review Since faucci double masked? telling Americans that? find times said thinks Betsy country, necessarily individual. supplies freezers short right hospitals health departments hard time buying them.

This attempt Ford's part muscle way front line company make cars competitors


Besides -

This vaccine produced fairly low volumes initially used almost exclusively healthcare workers, first responders, high risk patients.

Auto workers fall categories get Pfizer vaccine general population vaccinated.

The moderna vaccine stored regular freezer available within weeks Pfizer vaccine. 

The Astra Zenica vaccine couple months behind moderna vaccine stored refrigerator.

Johnson johnson, Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline produce huge quantities (billions doses each) vaccine 2021 stored refrigerator. can't trust anyone supports anymore. Interesting. always feel day flu shot sore arm afterwards. America Peter Pan style freedom without responsibility. Australia freedom earned sacrifice responsibility people. Baby steps indeed. least seeing light ahead end long tunnel. ICUs fill event disaster, Arizona really experience natural disasters, least ones easily mitigated like flash floods monsoons.

But we're talking beyond capacity even whole wings hospital completely reworked handle covid, specialists working general care, everyone's working 2 3 times normal working hours overtime, even much. lmao They’ll still friend.  Surrendering Covid. could imagine? Thats really cool man. That's good. wonder big supply freezers else trying buy them. outbidding government them, corporations? 

And freezers give priority terms gets vaccine distributed them. getting vaccines, would otherwise? real masks going wonder going hospitals getting sold seas highest bidder probably? Trump buddies bought reselling countries bet 3 times I’m sorry y’all going this. Keep hope he’ll okay. telling tell grandpa life isn’t worth living die. That’s all. promoting honesty see grandpa would feel that’s all. Maybe something point huh?

Nope, holier thou asshole virtue signaling internet acting know others think feel. Get fuck yourself. Well considering one really knows do, make yet another stupid statement fix problem? We’ve fed endless supply predictions advice, predictions wrong virus still here, “here” Earth. Sign lmao antivaxxers covidforever crowd shambles tonight God forbid corporation take cut profits order save lives. scenario you’ve described you’ve drastically reduced total interactions course cases go down. doesn’t mean *cant* get grocery store, means you’ve reduced risk factors would otherwise. I’m reminded animals nature deal harsh winter conditions. Whether it’s gathering nuts hibernating, together get better support one another. difficult trust unprecedented process data reviewed. Well, today bad day also sad day US Europe, US deaths hit 2,150 today, Europe's deaths reported today US equivalent numbers: Poland 4,698, Italy 4,691, Austria 4,330,

Mind you, that's simply approval. comes mess logistics, distribution, storage, manufacturing, anti-vaxers, administration, insurance.

America known efficiency well known. Cant reason anti vax crowd blinded hatred Trump imagine lab cooking vaccine up. converted car manufacturing produce N95 masks matter weeks. 9 months small amount vaccine production isnt big ask. recent failing. side effects would see months would already known now, certainly time vaccine rolls around you. possible side effects worried ones show years line. incredibly unlikely. Agreed 1000%. Two points make exactly uncle died Covid today hospital Madison. 1-When got sick 2 weeks ago, beds Madison. sent Edgerton’s hospital sat suffocating 2 days didn’t capability vent him. time ICU space opened Madison, chance. Bless trying, guess. 2-He caught Covid wife, caught job nursing, despite using PPE job provided. 

Fuck every single GOP. let happen blocked reasonable attempts prevent it. 10-15% population infected, total beginning, R0 far exponential, greater growth rate. idea persuade people right thing relies everyone rational actor, know fact case. also make sense entire reason laws know people always right thing.

It's like government tell drunk driving wrong making crime? persuade everyone right thing drink drive? No, law people drink drive time even knowing wrong even knowing illegal, consequences nothing letting everyone ""just make decisions"" great. Wow dude, still trying offer talking point watched blown obscure irrelevance spring. hope bring H1N1 next! Stay safe FL.

Well guess I'll throw bulletproof vests window then, despite evidence showing do, fact, lower chances getting fatal shot chest. long winter. Even vaccine approved mid December. It'll good several months general public gets it.  whole heartedly agree you, never underestimate society’s selfishness. shocked see many citizens different countries starting adopt muh freedumbs argument country handling corona virus wrong ...are planning that? 28 new deaths 280. ""very fine people "" sides $$ spend products need view ads YouTube. YT needs ad revenue can't offend entire demographics (like Fox News reporting facts rhe election).

Mental illness needs treatment encouraged. 28 death toll 280.  talking Pfizer Moderna? flu quite understand.

I think 4 million holidays houses, 5 million mostly frictional, inventory.

You argue 7 million (2 million ""occasional use"", 1 million occupied someone live there, 1 million ""family/personal reasons"", half million need repairs, half million foreclosed, half million repaired, half million used storage, half million extended absence, half million legal proceedings, etc).

But I'm quite sure issue.

You see monthly supply houses extremely low. time low 3.4 months supply -when generally around 5 months supply-. Um dude literally already 8% US. fine. real number likely great deal higher without enough symptoms test.   Maybe ease weekly mandated testing work. I’ve brain poked 22 fucking times tomorrow. Conservatives Iiberals locked us branch plant economy. solution socializing medical industry. built direct indirect public funding anyway. call ""stumped"". shave much less accuse anyone left groupthink living bubbles, whole reason left Fox Fox told truth handle looking safer space. much anxiety even PTSD? Jesus! Wow that's awful, well much guess. [Here link GA tech tool want determine risk. Well three months first shot. historically unlikely anything major gonna discovered. Every time school area goes virtual, news tags ""what parents think x school's decision"" bullshit statement kids spread schools.

But I'm supposed a-ok working conditions. Meanwhile, admonished keep six foot distance. Cause 6 feet *magic*.  wear mask nose! Problem solved! Many states counties laws wearing masks except Halloween covid existed. Alabama,

Georgia,
Louisiana,
Michigan,
Minnesota,
New Mexico,
New York,
North Carolina,
North Dakota,
Ohio,
Oklahoma,
South Carolina,
Virginia and
West Virginia currently anti-mask laws books.

Anti-mask laws vary state. South Carolina, person 16 wear mask conceals identity public except traditional holiday costumes, one’s employment, theater productions, gas masks specific purposes. Similar laws exist Georgia, North Carolina, West Virginia. Louisiana Minnesota, laws make exception religious face coverings. Virginia’s provisions make exception medical reasons governor declares emergency exemption. matter, though?

Vaccines help create immunity.

Ignoring virus (cause much needless suffering, eventually) also lead herd immunity.

Different paths, destination. people understand ventilation systems work modern airliners assume cabin air constantly recycled. reality, engine air intake continuously pulls in, heats, compresses fresh air outside provide cabin pressurization spent air released plane constantly. ""stale air"" feeling caused lower humidity pressure people used since pressure equivalent around 7000 feet sea level. said, leisure travel mode current state affairs dick move many, many reasons.  You’re still nobody knows story lie. excuse deplatform them. Oh yeah.

The company work pays doctors come office give everyone flu shots (voluntarily, course).

When you, company, paying employees insurance cost dozen freezers probably cheaper ICU stays due COVID complications, associated benefits death (ie: life insurance, cost hiring new employee, etc).

I would surprised big companies lots employees aren’t ensuring employees families first line vaccines. Wow guys pay COVID tests? Like... really? USA flair sub becoming synonym bad news... choose this.  Dakotas home must surely dimmest bulbs entire US. happening entirely predictable. sad see people dying needlessly.  That's 'cause quadroplexor smart cookie. 👍 I'm sorry whole world get politician like [Will vaccine available realise used ""literally"" figuratively?

The aim study describe outcomes patients coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outpatient setting early treatment zinc, low-dose hydroxychloroquine azithromycin (triple therapy) dependent risk stratification. retrospective case series study general practice setting. total 141 COVID-19 patients laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection year 2020 included. main outcome measures risk-stratified treatment decision rates hospitalisation all-cause death. median 4 days \[interquartile range (IQR) 3–6 days; available *n* = 66/141 patients\] onset symptoms, 141 patients (median age 58 years, IQR 40–67 years; 73.0% male) received prescription triple therapy 5 days. Independent public reference data 377 confirmed COVID-19 patients community used untreated controls. 141 treated patients, 4 (2.8%) hospitalised, significantly fewer (*P* &lt; 0.001) compared 58 (15.4%) 377 untreated patients \[odds ratio (OR) = 0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06–0.5\]. One patient (0.7%) treatment group died versus 13 patients (3.4%) untreated group (OR = 0.2, 95% CI 0.03–1.5; *P* = 0.12). cardiac side effects observed. Risk stratification-based treatment COVID-19 outpatients early possible symptom onset using triple therapy, including combination zinc low-dose hydroxychloroquine, associated significantly fewer hospitalisations. Yup try get upset things can’t control Idk Polio vaccine I’d use comparison considering it’s 1950s. water pooling bottom dripping fown chin? feel like changing mask 20 minutes. Lol okay friend. Whatever makes feel superior Well holidays let businesses sell lot worthless shit Whose murdering brown folks? conversations subreddit COVID? Im honestly confused... That’s basically kid’s pediatrician told asked vaccine. said aren’t trials approve kids, likely won’t time soon since risk groups older people. They’re going want vaccinate pretty much every willing adult moving pediatric population. state months months it’s even issue. No, gaslighting revisionism. original plan 2 weeks flatten curve, 2 weeks buy hospitals time. turned nonsense something studied decades.  Literally nowhere article say vaccines. talks Covid vaccine. Hopefully get fired. Antivaxxers scum. buddy Wisconsin got covid sister’s wedding along least half dozen people. Said ‘No big deal.’ Glad I’m least portion people taking seriously. I'll never understand anti-maskers think better anti-vaxers. not, worse. 

Getting vaccination miniscule risk. Wearing mask risk. 1 person died measles anti-vaxers last 6 year US. Tens thousands people die every year US anti-maskers.  don’t know people, bet they’re pretty pissed singled CDC like this. seen gop supporters posting vote run off? Depressed gop turn good increased dem turnout mean someone college student come contact old people /can get tested visit family, virus doesnt pose much threat Joke's them. don't. none ""it need cover nose"" shit see republicans management even WORSE most, allow wear N95s (even bring home), would ""off brand"" even put plexiglass receptionists.

And Covid tests day long.

Cuts time virus.
Potentially stops infectious least shortens time are.

If enough people vaccinated means virus can’t spread unchecked find new victims constantly. slows eliminates spread ONE virus eventually (in theory...in practice idea COVID). individual people generally position figure medical information themselves. Even worse dangerous information. someone going around selling snake-oil get rich, telling people drinking bleach would cure covid, that's dangerous. us trust medical institutions intelligent enough examine studies make knowledgeable recommendations works doesn't. even end wrong, trust would trust people make correct decision based little real information. long ago people ending hospitals dumb ""Tide Pod Challenge"". though going say let millions recovered probably immune people cruise.

In essence, smell it, mask theater. less fresh oxygen center US coastal cities. Explains mass retardation somewhat. Ya also meant limit social gatherings essential outings. IE retail shopping, indoors entertainment, gym, indoor dining, already breaking recommended protocols. whole thing massive, massive failure public communication.

Everyone thinks appropriate situation. Even insane anti-mask morons. Leave violence professionals risk trauma death. COVID going breaking records winter long. Come man...tailgating muni lot, winter, that's kind shit builds character😂😂 Claiming something cure coronavirus illegal? certainly cannot sell something claim. Yeah...theres risk ways. Probably much getting vaccine covid highly contagious.

Vaccines consequences though long term. likely rare. unknown are, hundreds millions people take them...there negative reactions.

Heck give 300 million people tictac tell vaccine...some would likely report side effects. That's placebos work too.

I'd say I'll definately get vaccine though. needs over. rushed? corners cut? make claims back actual evidence.

Are scientist? know ANYTHING vaccines made? clinical review process? talking ass? Uh, yeah. virus much discriminates age. literally watched NYC burn COVID Spring

Native Americans afraid infected white man's disease? year again? countries... seems government doesn’t order right thing, nobody right thing. all... even say it, might still it... Hello there! Singapore, country made masks mandatory since earlier year. surge foreign workers dormitory. Everyone part, wore masks, proper social distancing, proper control crowds, it, checked news covid numbers country weeks almost 0 everyday, cases get foreign visitors, subjected 2 weeks quarantine arrive.

How it? Well government hired lost jobs enforcers, would ensure masks worn times public, would ensure groups 5, would also give fines people failed so. Foreigners chose neglect laws, deported straight back never allowed back in. Even till today, masks mandate lifted everyone, mean everyone, young old, wears masks. would even see people jogging wearing masks, bring one along wear immediately stop.

We surge, yes, know what's death rate like? 28 deaths 58000+ confirmed cases. That's less 0.0005%. even low rate, still wear masks.

We lockdown well, once, April year, that.

Look country, Vietnam Australia Taiwan true success stories. Tf governor preventing local officials mask mandates? anyone assuming...its you. still ""[m]ost viruses germs spread easily flights air circulates filtered airplanes"" right [their industry promoted bullshit, [fails account air circulation actual social distancing works real Oh turntables. 

Isn’t big anti-vax corona statement year been: “stay home scared, I’m going live life.”

Stay international flights scared vaccine. going live lives. awesome, it’s worrying media consistently used terms “approved” “approval” relation FDA granting EUAs (emergency use authorizations) COVID treatments, vaccines. EUA lower standard, full stop, require “substantial evidence safety effectiveness” typical drug vaccine approval would. simply requires reasonable believe safe effective. difference. Source: work regulatory. Guess what! Danmarks Capital region also accounts 55% deaths, 30% population.

But didn’t holiday week 9. strange. 

I wonder there’s anything else distinguishes capitals rest respective countries. could be? America [Leon Lett Superbowl right. stern, strongly worded federal advisory two weeks ago, ya know, people actively making travel plans, buying turkeys, etc... one that's planning attend big family dinner going cancel today, lol. Lame comment. yet another failure messaging. Fauci urging Americans sacrifice traditional Thanksgiving save **themselves** ""lives"". Appeal Americans' sense self-preservation. Skip Thanksgiving protect yourself. Skip Christmas protect yourself. message Americans hear. damaging. people authority shut things set types restrictions. can’t ways. 

Should Trump set example wearing mask? Absolutely, people shutting businesses ruining people’s livelihoods go enjoying family friends telling everyone else stay home. It’s bush league credibility window. curfew going stop gathering someone house? Haha hilarious. think countries like New Zealand can’t import anything shut borders? Trade isn’t affected countries. Please, learn basics international trade. Correct I’m wrong love/hate reddit. love intelligent shoots arguments completely unrelated threads. hate idiocy times. private gatherings problem, shut restaurants gyms then? Because, said, 'wearing masks doesnt mean much'. Everyone knows it, including you. Masks provide noticeable safety, government locks things down, instead letting people business masks.  Locking business **the way** ensure virus transmitted via business. business = transmission. Business = transmission. Masks masks. 

So, 'If 70% people wore masks, virus would over' completely false statement. Close 100% people do, virus still spreads, actually private gatherings 7 households illegal. masks worked, masked private gatherings would problem all. According [news understanding occupancy rate hospital beds coronavirus patients exceeded 25 percent ***total beds available*** Tokyo several prefectures. situation, ""医療スタッフが不足しており、受け入れ可能病床は満床の状況だ"" means ""shortage medical staff situation beds occupied"". mean ""75% capacity still utilized worst-hit areas"". rest 75% capacity used non-Covid patients. this, March again? reports people holiday week 9 likely return home infected people holiday week 8

No stranger view.

I hate view Fair. definitely lot gray area considering ""necessary"", certainly measures taken. That's basically laws are, social contracts. Murder illegal would detrimental society went unchecked. That's definitely different case vaccines, still.

I also mention general thoughts, cuff. issue I've thought deeply flush thoughts reasoning. agree 99.9% cases, one one. agree fear mongering detrimental public consciousness (as seen pre-COVID 24 hour news cycle) create problems, specific case (an airborne contagion spreads exponentially) think ironically would helped actually happened (being downplayed). It’s fact many professions aren’t “essential” forced public, putting risk. It’s fair many can’t stay home, aren’t considered essential wait much longer get vaccine. Let's honest, DIShonesty like destroyed public trust. reason given officials told people masks work early on. nothing health. fact, UNhealthy advice helped foster anti-mask movement currently hampering efforts combat virus. Why? want pope buying masks enough health care workers. manipulation. cashing trust get back. 

When over, trust toilets future calamity going magnified lack trust people public officials. episode laid bare many thinking people disconnected interests charge, even times crisis. Uncle Mrs. Krabapple? sure committed posting numbers everywhere every day. know family responsible infecting all? think people also think careful admit they're not. may think careful traveling, 10 family members five households live within hour get together. Cyberpunk delay incoming? Fuck nevermind vaccines show side effects months/years introduced. Nevermind recovery rate within decimal point 100% fear dominates rights! Wha? Michigan they're telling us go black friday shopping, stay home! also hook potential side effects (very unlikely knows vaccine 300m people)? so, doubt will. Thanks, McConnell! Useless imp. Cue people working home screaming ""it's fair!"". want go bars again. always chance Biden keeps around guess.

Non-zero chance will, that's exactly kind radical centrism deals in. going lie would love see military style lock would arrest anti-maskers curfew violators.

 Let people endangering lives others rot die covid jail. guy caught little bit weed deserve die jail cell covid. people do. point say won’t get vaccine.

I said two things. I’m rush get first wave vaccines. Secondly, I’m employer/corporation whatever telling comes shit like this. 

Show otherwise. half **supporters**. everyone follower. largely airborne virus... Mexico bad USA, please continue cliche reddit America bashing karma vaccine provided ""free"" Yeah great. Thanks perspective! It’s sad see unfortunately brave journalists won’t first get it... really need vaccinate everyone soon can! I’m happy Bill Gates really stepping outspoken proven benefits vaccination. However even majority population vaccinated, reality still need practice social distancing mask wearing. government regulates dangerous things. protect mouth breathers themselves. *northern Slovakia slinked chat* hope not. people actually make contributions material well country, media count. skills fungible value. Florida shuts things down? genuinely know encouraged people that. specific comment mine mind, respond that, we'll discussion.

If follow people around post vague associations things said elsewhere, without responding say now, criticism. trolling. realize someone really posting something criticized, posting something else might reasonable, go respond reasonable weird unexplained accusations, come looking like crazy person legitimizing person? get one. pretty cool animals.  app nothing burger. downloaded it, eventually tested positive covid never assigned 6 digit code one app bluetooth notified proximity. even called request code twice avail...open bluetooth security risk bother? -we severely undertest still lot confirmed cases per capita, reality least 5x, likely more.

The epidemiologist say reported cases multiplied 3 10 times countries get realistic figures. 

The government playing politics pandemic. made show hiring largest plane world bring masks China turned useless. respirators. summer busy infighting, campaigning presidential elections passing controversial laws get prepared expected surge fall. haphazardly convert public indoor spaces field hospitals accept sick patients them. meantime intensive care beds full ambulances wait drive hours find place hospital patient. Poland going northern Italy, NYC area, Spain, Brazil, many countries areas went through. 😀 I’m actually happy. Starting Thanksgiving prep thank concern. much appreciated 😍 BACK WORK, WAGE SLAVE HUMOUR! put another perspective, around 7,564 people die day causes. stick 2k deaths day Covid, accounts nearly 1/3rd daily *looks white house* TLDR: author talks hypocrisy local rules claim ok things others higher risk. causes confusion unnecessary risk. It'll politicians, doners celebrities elderly. know. tell truth don;t believe numbers see purposeful efforts made many states keep reported numbers down. matter what, worse come going much worse say anything US, countries' employers require vaccine well, great luck backwoods vaccine ignorance whatever country in! Covid bigotrym two biggest problems currently. neo-nazis. Everything, easy justify I'm safe followed distancing tested.

&amp;#x200B;

Its dumb sharing needle cleaned lighter. justify saying tested negative HIV/hep last week, ignore fact fucking around people days. What? They're exponential. base defined one case exponent defined other. apply virus, base would many people one person infects per day, exponent would many days going. So, x^(10) would 10 days unknown infection rate. 10^(x) would mean one person infects 10. Absurd. sounds like plan replace staff travel nurses somehow saves money? makes sense.. somehow. We’re far gone nation. majority accepts virus taken seriously vocal minority doesn’t even think it’s real sort mitigation oppression. minority also ones would go far discredit raw footage fake anyone actors. delusional [even Covid, don’t think it’s death’s door 180s picture. matter do, continue challenge vaccine literally save us Covid. “ seem” to. 

Meanwhile, dog lies there, couch, giving shit. Stay safe well! can't horseshit. one, natural infection seems produce immune response least long 80-90% people. Secondly, vaccines typically produce larger immune response natural infection. 

Most vaccine makers said data yet, expect protect least year, still bit unknown now. almost travelling They’re assuming people irresponsible partied, took masks off, didn’t practice good hygiene, etc, got sick. isn’t true, people everything “right” still got sick. Hipaa? Hey, say neverm pretty nice places half people delusional followers supreme leader. think could lighten distancing. go see people want. Maybe Thanksgiving later. ability drive? Nah, seems like ok guy. folks name? Now, that's different story... People attacking Fox News reporting... news. realize Pope literally can't anti-Catholic right? 

Catholic dogma gives pope infallibility supremecy. authority decide considered formal beliefs Catholic church.

If think POPE anti-Catholic, would good time actually crack open Bible read Jesus. Pope FAR closer Jesus teaches obviously understand. ....this scary. hope becomes norm keep disease future. Self employed, don’t live US. didn’t know job get fired from! dont think accounts people longer infectious?

They look raw ""cases"", case asymptomatic Covid 3 months ago isnt scary. I'm sorry going alone. Vaccine people arguing taking it. saw coming mile away...Fucked world live in. Orange tans golf priority. think cool nuke cities full civilians. I'd say pretty misguided. could think reasons late visit Poland lol. paid attention articles here, workshop asking. 

Vaccines go health care workers highest risk groups first. 

Also, getting vaccinated vaccines means people get symptoms, still get infected / carriers. 

So think get shot throw mask away next day, wrong. stimulus passed like last time, handout rich sides blame side voting it. Clearly.

For me, spend day seeing three people, two can't converse. husband noted I'm emotionally great late. mean quite lot Christian faiths choose from, like. Nothing new really there, decades GOP base thinking leadership fine they've looting burning country ground. Papers please! article's title bit misleading. understand, open minded believe science. think people free make horrible choices. also understand covid completely different second hand smoke. equilibrium set measures keeps R value 1 virus can't grow time. need put place *immediately* *any* virus sight since delay means infection time grow exact measures taken anyway, perhaps strict lockdown get control.

I'm Italy current measures seem sufficient infection rate started going again. happened 2 months thousands lives late. Wrong dentist, would imagine fairly high risk contact. 

My husband went cleaning new dentist Monday. dentist sat foot away mask around neck talking him, pulled checkup.  Obviously husband wearing mask moment, doc talking, expecting exam. 

I told needed new dentist. said “largely”, correct. vast majority infection airborn pathogens.

But there’s still *chance* getting surface transmission.

And whole ass point. true perfection *basically* impossible, right things still get sick.  made deal them. nazis.

*Peace time intensifies* could said America well. Seems like world whole really struggling pandemic many different ways. keep trying keep spreading incorrect information. Read Papski's comment. AFAIR compare deaths year-to-year \~1000 daily year months.

While official stats show covid related deaths \~650 (and many cases non-covid case reported covid, hospitals get money per covid case, e.g. death falling ladder covid).

The rest might e.g. people get procedure hospitals mostly covid-only, get heart attach cancer - sorry, might get bed. really. now, number people contracted covid lower number get seasonal colds given year. past nose piece works glasses sit weird enough angle end starting get migraine pretty quickly. Mostly, live fogged glasses Im out. can't wear mask driving. news projected 20 mil covid end January. That’s 1 every 16 people. point assume everyone else it. wonder way display data using custom number days' average. Maybe one's curious enough there's easy way Excel?

What pick instead genocide Tutsi Rwanda? That's much recent estimated 400 K 500 K Tutsi killed.

&amp;#x200B;

Now Rwanda case white people killing, maybe interest you? need look Australia New Zealand China see needs done truly get back normal. takes months serious social distancing efforts. US people think end March/April felt. takes 3 months. immediate local lockdowns new cases detected afterward. done, has. talking about?

[Here Poland's case history looks works skills demand. come relatively unspecialized positions require someone show up, huge labor surplus since 1980s wave offshoring automation. Obviously left mostly Nazis.

( /s ) mention deaths categorized covid. It’s insane amount people dying lately...Poland control it’s shitshow. gonna say “until happens them”. stories I’ve seen even doesn’t even matter brain dead cult members Lol you’re douchebozzle usual insecure Americans reading actual article; using proof uniquely incompetent regards Covid response.

In reality, Japan's medical staff already sounding alarm bells even though hospital occupancy rates hit 25% areas.

Again: 25% occupancy rate. means 75% capacity still utilized worst-hit areas.

Japan failing. Japan taking virus seriously. That's already sounding alarm bells despite low actual hospitalization rates. They'd rather br safe get complacent risk collapse weeks line nothing done case rates keep rising. article us describing autoimmune disorder brought viral infection. comment understand. polish kids get MMR vaccine like American kids do? recently read theory maybe kids (and African areas) better time Covid. Apparently formula changed 1970s seems offer protection. (Will hunt link post find it.) know right? that's slap wrist. OANN next InfoWars. live rural Western Kentucky seen many cases throughout year. hard find someone new person multiple people gotten it. past weeks, cases exploded. wife I, whole family got every day hear someone else caught it. think people starting see reality disease here.

We're problem US fact COVID-19 became highly politicized strange reason, now-exiting administration felt acknowledging pandemic taking action would problematic re-election.

Even news basically like, they’ve got four floors full COVID patients nurses want benefits

Ah yes, famously ""liberal"" mainstream media, working overtime behalf hard-core leftist for-profit hospital owners.

Your anecdote reinforces point. can't nurses. everyone working health care simply putting walking out. 

Unity offense effective strategy ""divide conquer"" strategy owners employed decades. No, thigh bone called tenor. (and is) evidence masks don’t work, wasn’t lie. Studies done Asia general public wearing masks, cloth masks. showed masks worse nothing - increased spread increasing face touching creating false sense protection.

You inferred needlessly hostile usage dot three times row end sentence, assumed meaning alone.

I originally responded to:

Which described earlier positing two sources use different hours day's numbers.

You clapped back doesnt make outlier didnt say didnt. 

Right first assumption, assumed somehow accused calling anything outlier, obviously confused replied Neither I? 

And went several comment long grammar lesson usage three dots made assume meant one two things:

1. “or using different hours day idiot, isnt obvious?”""
2. “dont conspiracy theorist explanation youre overreaching” 

Which two extreme things deduce three periods row alone...

You made several assumptions went defensive reasons beyond me. know internet, Reddit places, everyone trying start fight specifically so, would used something simple ""..."" so.

It seems like went way get internet fight nothing... Thanks.

I’m still optimistic future everyone else’s. find hold every silver lining.... everyday. 
I feel like people’s mentality generally negative add Covid.... well forget it!
We still much grateful for. mean I’m grateful, still cats. 😹 Thanksgiving, Christmas /New Year going help much slowdown Covid one hour entire workplace gather lunch warehouse. 25-40 people, insane it’s recommended eat household tomorrow?

I'm sure I'm one whose family cancelled Christmas everyone sick. things happen pretty much every time people shrug say that's life goes, virus, decide flip fight instead.  I'm pretty sure lot motivation really think virus big enough deal interrupt plans, rather actually mad missing holiday gathering. one thinks permanent work home stuff load bullshit?

Ps- weren’t smartass is... hypocritical?? realize one going anywhere. *you* planning going see (at least) two different households people. fact, even maintained plans see one another virus. epitome say, do. aren’t seeing people positive. weren’t, you’d still plans. Yo read article? mainly cites recent study, including stats like 35% covid-positive symptomatic patients study lingering symptoms weeks testing negative. anecdotes end piece, say positive tests antibody tests. made assumption based anecdotes specifically mentioning testing. Nothing article misleading see. 

There's lot danger inherent downplaying deadly disease warning people potential serious complications.

Acknowledging there's possibility lingering severe complications running around screaming everyone going die. scary kind thinking world wide, problem pushing propaganda information standing facts data, ones data I've seen flawed targeted areas represent areas. Sure rural areas little spread, schools safer. high infection rate community, adding school mix amplify effects. rocket science, think goal make seem safe hope catch what's really going on. United States states notification laws, areas big outbreaks schools little contact tracing, quick say happened elsewhere kids symptoms. 
Unfortunately us critical thinkers minority expect us sheep. countries like germany choice keep kids home school, least USA elsewhere choice. 
We chose keep kids home virtual school, trust local government, state federal government right good didn't, countless school outbreaks area substantial community spread.
The schools gone dept health guidelines decided we'll keep schools open kids getting sick.  
I think problem, kids spread without symptoms get everyone else sick, kids die cause family die that's acceptable them.

Fortunately, that's true kind rational people well. assholery (my new favorite word) extra vocal covid. Also know say mRNA vaccines shown safe. never approved mRNA vaccine before. say healthy 20 year old, quite possible vaccine could risky combined risk getting COVID-19 developing complications. individual perspective best decision take vaccine, even though societal point view best thing many people possible take (as long complication rate certain threshold). naive acknowledge this.

The thing is, disease bad enough people would take vaccine would worried, need force to. disease bad enough people would stay home voluntarily too. ugly truth bad, bad enough scare people make anyone's choice easy.

Patient 1 

Overwhelmed ER Doc (OED): hey I’ve got patient want transfer you. She’s 83 Covid positive, taking care sick grandson husband. needs fluids O2 support. 

Picky Field Hospital ( PFH): well sounds like she’s okay. chance could discharged next 24-48 hours?

PFH: well don’t take patients discharged soon admission. paper work transfer costs don’t support it. We’re gonna decline.

PFH: sorry, we’re equipped
For OB patients. 

OED: know what, I’m done trying transfer . I’m it. guys practically empty I’m running beds, running meds, staff gonna walk out. 


Later day, evening news: “The N.Y. field hospital closing today due lack patients. Sources say simply aren’t enough appropriate patients keep hospital running. “ 

Bubba: See, told it’s hoax

If need travel 8-12 streets find first grieving family, messaging stay home die probably work. Anyone notice closer get vaccine aggressive deniers get anti-mask/anti-lockdown rhetoric? that, wonder? Ford salaried office workers still WFH July, imagine vaccine prioritized towards factory workers, others cannot work remote. News media US need show raw footage virus suffering death causes.

That'll probably start first big wave after, say, late January.

There new people blame then, people newly incented blaming. bad thing fear mongering headline like this.

Oh yeah? happen? rent gunna pay itself. I’m spending year longer isolated. neither anyone else. upset want numbers there. point stands. It’s people’s fault government failed act. WRONG. filed taxes, paid schools tuition. receive stimulus. Collegiates younger 25 included stimulus. virus worse cold, show symptoms is, no. Belgium compared first wave hospitalization death ration fell half. kids looks like 99.85% fine probably pessimistic.

I'm Spain atm doctor told know: intensive care units mostly full old fat people (not deserve die: misread me).

&amp;#x200B;

If take young, healthy, fit person think 99.7% pessimistic. probably like 99.99%

&amp;#x200B;

BTW moment plan Spain, least that's doctor told me, give vaccine 75+ years old people known prior health condition.

&amp;#x200B;

It unthinkable strategy fight virus several countries might give vaccine (which France, example, mandatory) persons risk try reach heard immunity precisely giving vaccine risk.

&amp;#x200B;

You may like numbers there's number starting we're closing entire economy we're giving whole new vaccine kids world. maybe 99.7% mention, maybe 99.85%, maybe ""four nines"" there's number.

Yeah “good them”. Since illness deaths winter/spring summer ..

I’m really worried enough ‘Americans get vaccinated achieve herd immunity, longer amount time could taken. made decision read Irish Post, so... you. reported worst symptoms vaccine, affect everyone. cautious individual reports media, people know they've injected vaccine placebo could totally something else (seasonal flu, headache whatever reason...).

If report initial study effects watched great detail - that's phase 3 - appears affects small fraction participants mild symptoms.

For part, everybody know COVID mild symptoms, start. people dying know. comparable.

So prefer taking real risk stuck bed high fatigue month, want take small risk perhaps headache hours, fine. would guess OP meant *immediate,* like bombs street. Problem this

Good HR something it.  Source?  Yes difference is, it’s fault. Imagine going knowing killed someone. took 6 seconds googling debunk publicly stating intent fight bitter end, Japan's leaders (the Supreme Council Direction War, also known ""Big Six"") privately making entreaties publicly neutral Soviet Union to mediate peace terms favorable Interesting, sources those? Several probably explained immigration, would nice see Take guess ""I"" IQ means I'm sorry, saying poster needs acquire compassion anger management skills they're disgusted selfish adults throw full-on destructive tantrums middle Target, host massive maskless events, shoot people dared ask wear masks? GAF think? Isn’t fought revolution? We’re stuck measuring shit farthings they’re forcing “jab” throats. Yeah, they're comparable US's overall. 

If manage testing arrival quarantine, think it'll hurt either country per se. argue whether people travelling all, that's fair enough; would worried that, they're coming from. thought pre-prints China Europe indicated viral transmission occur 27 days infection... I've always thought 14 day quarantine far short. that's true, new guidance insane opening schools. sets single people year back dating. People meeting future partners/spouses/coparents right now, babies would conceived years road aren't. Right - I'm interested pure numbers. example, people present symptoms statistically likely present symptoms Day 7 - let's say point, 50% infected symptomatics present day - much rate go every subsequent day? 

I'm quarantine 29 hours point. I'd like know numbers correlate likely present symptoms period time. *suspect* pretty close 0, though literally anything 0 reason enough stay basement tomorrow afternoon. make mandatory, least free get? said hear virus, less like it.

Buddy, go ahead ride broom back hell day now. comment controversial?? Masks important. extraordinarily worse  critical quarantine wear mask. Poland can't get case rate control, healthcare system bandwidth diagnose treat anything COVID. can't imagine people, especially health conditions, willing go doctor that's everyone COVID one wearing mask.

As right least, US, estimates excess deaths somewhere around ~300k vs COVID death toll ~250k. generously assume perfect diagnosis rate none 50k difference directly due COVID, we're looking 1:5 ratio deaths COVID deaths. now, preventing COVID seems like pressing issue, though 50k neglected (but could also still due underreporting).

Efforts still made ensure non-COVID excess deaths grow, pretending nothing wrong way that. Flock immunity could thus also relevant Sweden.  **We bit cautious using word** breathes little given about, says Anders Tegnell.  **But basic idea probably starting become relevant see virus, need get.** control way.  demands action believes fire allowed burn?  **It's like forest fires things, make burn little slowly carefully, make burn admitted March, even admitted want use term ""herd immunity"" even though ""where need get"". use precious rights served food drink entertained? could've guessed con artist would leading country, though... literally would've dismissed outlandish movie came out. even Sweden trouble trying reverse course. weird look country good example restrictions. There's little add mean anything what's already said, feel compelled tell facing impossible task kind courage human history able muster. imagine put every day, living personal life since began.

You're worthless. expendable, alone. can, order survive this. world always need people like you, matter many, efforts nothing, even feel like sometimes.

Be safe, well. wish best. I'm sorry father going through, experience need hate feeling grateful suffer long (and neither around him) divided. Country side/small cities East part general religious conservative. Big (by standards) cities range somewhat liberal liberal would say. huge division country causes lot problems resentment sides. stupid strategy bound fail? That’s bad OK, read stories one actually tested positive Covid... 78 year old woman. (or doctors) ""guess"" it. 27 year old dude simply said ""confirmed covid long hauler"", OK how?? lol Also, please read Dr. Gerald Evans end comes studying presentation long-term symptoms, Dr. Gerald Evans, chair division infectious diseases Queen’s University Kingston Health Sciences Centre, said **it’ll important distinguish who’ve truly infected COVID-19 there’s evidence they’ve ever people haven’t received official coronavirus diagnosis observing long-term effects, Stevens said **they get serological test, measures antibodies bloodstream associated becomes tricky lot symptoms people reporting terribly specific — things like trouble concentrating, headache, brain fog,” said. **“These symptoms number things well.”**

I think honestly fearmongering. virus already bad enough need kind nonsense. go strike, point support it. I'm beginning really hate selfishness arrogance human race. I'm curious many companies right, like company work for. went 100% virtual early March U.S. offices remained closed ever since. CEO saying open back 2021, date specified yet, anyone continue working home even point. 

Top execs prepared take pay cuts made contingency plans layoffs would measure last resort. allowed special CTO COVID-related sick days. We've even received home office allowance, paid last month, questions asked. (I could really use new office chair home, quite welcome.) 

My company always claimed people matter: employees clients. tend skeptical utterances, say they've lived ideals, exceeded them. hope so! Thank willing ask learn. find people really unrealistic views ""welfare"" like unless seen close.

I seriously doubt make much way long-term increases assistance programs (Democrats resisted since Reagan public opinion assistance programs), least hopefully staunch flow cuts existing programs hopefully institute kind additional temporary stimulus due COVID. 

Sane first-world countries replacing 80% people's salaries giving people certain amount money every month. probably go far, need -something- right now. Geez, hard check CDC Stats?

The stats listed Covid, I'm unsure quoted think valid. Dude, quoted post think smoking gun. sure think continuing demonstrate inability reason. make tiktok dancing videos that’ll really show us exhausted are. I'm annoyed seeing this. can't compare country size US country size Poland. disingenuous. compare states European countries. Arguably states similar population densities. really interesting surprisingly good vaccine news complex relatively muted effect people's behaviors. theory, great vaccine news provide fuel governments go even harder virus anything, complete opposite. H7N9 already infected people. 5 separate outbreaks 2013-2017. appears one viruses kills host quickly allow effectively spread far, could outbreaks full pandemics. Lol others Europe going same. excludes private companies refuse entry business vaccinated. aggressive, rapid, expanding community spread across country, reaching 2,000 counties,"" said set reports, dated November 22 obtained reports compared mitigation strategies mask usage, social distancing dining restrictions working parts country Europe, warned efforts parts US states aggressive mitigation, beginning see impact mitigation despite cooling weather. also seeing stabilization many European countries implemented strong public private mitigation, preserved schooling. However, many areas country, mitigation efforts inadequate recently implemented see significant impact,"" reports mitigation strategies, task force said, require ""significant behavior change Americans,"" including wearing masks. parent (yet) judging hell would allow much screen time two year old?  everyone lives country active cases. big change reduction essential retail capacity 50% 35%. means long lines incentive buy bulk avoid shopping much. mind asking, state in? I'm sorry work bunch dismissive assholes. Okay argument is... hoping restrictions don’t get lifted here? Doesn’t seem solid.

Also: you’re still using examples! 😂😂 crying. troll. Actually I’m pretty positive u are. Scotland, mask wearing pretty good, least I've seen. Even see people street wearing despite told to. numbers fairly consistent, likely due measures too, mask wearing must helped too. Make sure enter doorknob licking contest too. Hey, guy you’re talking correct here. good one. Riigghhhtt people either cautious month ago expecting aftermath thanksgiving look like things currently are, thanksgiving going disaster. Really? coma? understand asymptomatic spread? Come buddy, best Scientists world? asymptomatic spread SARS-COV-1. would common sense follow guidelines even precaution considering they're apart family alter guidelines accordingly figured pathogen worked. lol think things better January thanksgiving, Christmas, mention flu hospitalizations top that... schtick people playing since June?

How long waiting play out? Tomorrow Thanksgiving, yesterday deadliest day pandemic since May 6th. Almost 2,100 deaths. instead making shivering people get water wrap towel plan boil ocean.

That's bold move, Cotton, let's see pays off. talking about? remove anything. right privilege shows post lack reading comprehension astonishing. even encourage people spread more, actually learned understand people saying instead putting words mouth would realize OP saying save slots high risk people aren’t high risk go store allow high risk people use delivery services. much get satisfaction ranting senselessly like toddler online

Such amazing hypocrisy. point I'm confident family able make spring without getting infected. people big Thanksgiving gathering step closer wider herd immunity us enjoy get vaccinated.  answering questions, them:

The planning absolutely happening, behind scenes.

This digital version: paper records vaccination also accepted, take longer get lines.

Forgeries possible, people willing commit actual crime (fraud) get shot instead. true believers small enough number safely ignored.

Tie individual name birthdate, like everything else.

If lose it, go back got shot get copy records.

Scanning/paper verification could done internet-enabled phone minimally-trained employee.

It take longer get places, much longer. people able validated three-second scan. Show phone, scan, beep, next. Probably speed boarding line airplane. want live lives without told do. want make judgements risks take. incomprehensible position. read article first. Private companies ask pretty much anything employees. Especially new hires. Can’t wait anti maskers hoaxers sudden start worrying governments lack response end January.  Couldn’t keep contract tracing back several infection points make numbers look worse worse? It’s caught husband Covid week. since he’s getting tested weekly specific time frame would infected since know tested negative 5 days prior. Since he’s symptoms wouldn’t known could spread others. I’m saying everyone get tested weekly, work essential job contact people understand testing regularly try prevent asymptomatic transmission. media shit. People power. Tech companies people parroting Facebook everywhere. Regardless better worse family dinner fact reason talk shopping home black Friday people power give single fuck you. talk Black Friday packed retail stores many thousands infected day, people sneezing shit waiting line get 15% overpriced crap. talk 'the new normal' Thanksgiving Christmas.. June, majority people need/want vaccine one nearly back normal. I'd bet happen April/May, surely June done. It’s also little annoying us following rules along. Nothing area overwhelmed. we’re lifting January. what... harsh lockdown difference couple weeks? 😂

Edit: also restrictions aren’t lifted understanding. increasing “how” many people home gather with. mask mandates still mandatory indoors. also believe capacity increased indoors either so... really. can’t eat cheese. need it. Wasn’t whole point post?  look kinky like something Mad Max. new era vaccinology thanks corona? Wow, really uplifting! Yes south Dakota densely populated. South Dakota style spread metropolitan areas would horrifying. beyond help. love love love removed post know you’re full it. 

Don’t worry though continue call constant bullshit asserted without evidence also dismissed without evidence. question? COVID bad idiot misleading headline. cite CDC study restaurants. ""Were forced work 2020 pandemic, so, may titled compensation!""

No doubt mind hearing many years come US. people adhering basement dwellers did, all, callously called state ""God's waiting room."" seem mind clearing said waiting room. get call one governors local leaders.  See congressman someone else town hall read opinion pieces website.

They really feel way.  Fundamentally. Culturally completely different them. making assumption Americans come terms truly divided different we're raised educated it'll make sense. American individualism, probably share, manifests differently combine local culture. Plus, going keep pandemic level viruses climate change gets fiercer.

Source? Look sucks guys dad also 92... Maybe best example persuade young healthy people stay inside indefinitely. Really? don’t doubt you. told buddy Seattle don’t get benefits time around. really need convince get it? Plenty heads state done this. disgusting thing, whatever though human. 18 people photo. needs start top know won’t happen.  Burnt forests encourage rejuvenation new growth, guess. mother Alzheimer’s. never position she’s in.

I’m saying I’ll never get Alzheimer’s, won’t sitting chair drooling years without knowing am. way prevent diagnosis, decline make use it. people follow warnings basement dwellers test 10 million people Wuhan couple week!!!1!1... 10 days. didn’t “come vaccine since spread began March”. Coronaviruses focal point “the next big pandemic” century. Firms Canada Israel prepping moment long word “Covid” part regular dialogue. RNA trials worked. Get fucking vaccine continue fucking drag society. Looks like time new job!  lol. ther isnt gonna sporting events next year.. yall smoking crack Make case free do. 

Any uneducated types still using dead law ""yelling fire theater"" case look silly. like envision people breaking rules kind anti-science jerks think ""silent majority"" people think specific activity travel plan safe general understand danger virus. We're pretty good justifying behaviors want engage in, traveling holidays different seen past 9 months. People say got negative test sometime week traveling, wore 4 week old N95 makes invincible, tried really really hard touch anything international airport. make totally safe, right? even individual somehow travel safely multiply 50 million totally safe, right? RTFA. gathering 12 people. Every single one got sick, infected 3 family members attend. Yeah doubtful.. mother law still goes church mask-less twice week despite 8 current cases coronavirus village 2,000.

She says it’s disrespectful God wear mask.. recently published deaths years' weeks. published polands national statistics office, source data anything weird 2020? right we're outdoing previous years 6k+ extra deaths week

you shouldnt trust officially published numbers deaths related covid pitiful amount tests someone wasnt tested death wont included covid deaths regardless died on.

not mention glorious government recently changed way covid testing numbers published - previously region would publish sort independently, total number central. regions cant publish results, get central ones, span days got nearly 30k cases/day 15k now, magic  It'll fungus, so, spore bursts. necessarily true. vaccine doesn’t prevent getting Covid, increases tolerance higher viral loads. It’s entirely possible still get enough exposure. also don’t know rollout look like, guarantee people won’t access months. Then, course, people refuse get it... height crisis China, Taiwanese news media showing every scrap leaked footage Wuhan loop. kept people indoors. No, openly admitting strategy herd immunity back March means strategy herd immunity. guess entourage definition asymptomatic... Symptoms infection usually fever immune response. highly uncomfortable patient consult treated. immuno compromised patients infection, exhibit less fever, considered asymptomatic severe symptom infection damaged something. logic says ok eat restaurant ok thanksgiving dinner home family flawed

It's not. restaurants I've security, people allowed without mask, parties/tables least 6 feet apart, parties limited 6 people, people must remain seated unless they're going bathroom, point must wearing mask. one going Thanksgiving gatherings. Additionally, people traveling across states gatherings, likely adding spread. like said, comparing Thanksgiving dinners restaurants false equivalence. Poland locked early see effects first wave April/May, coupled likely level testing time there's particular record infections occurred time.

So way Poland getting ""first hit"" like places do? universities normally close dorms Christmas, extended year include Thanksgiving (so students won’t traveling back campus December/finals). Filipino. deal japanese, Germans italians. Actually think americans die along side people Philippines. ✊🏽✊🏻

Well I'm like ✊🏿 _your_ girlfriend, strangely enough.


(Also, nice one, lol) important takeaways article According state health department reports, largest sources coronavirus infections workplaces like meatpacking plants warehouses, institutional settings like prisons retirement communities, businesses like restaurants Small gatherings definitely risk, infection community, riskier small gatherings going be. People let guard wearing masks they're indoors high-risk settings, seem like there's clear evidence particularly driving Outdoor gatherings, especially ones really outdoors fresh air people space spread out, lowest risk possible situation. really last thing we're putting regulation place stop. lot governments summer closing beaches closing parks, actually encouraging people go instead restaurants stores things like curfews? I've spoken lot epidemiologists public health specialists, we're really sure justification terms science curfews is. think assumption leaders placing curfews effect people decrease planned activities curfew. ... concern lot epidemiologists I've spoken people instead move activities earlier make people concentrated smaller time window would worse. know would rather catching covid cholera yellow fever thousand times.

Let's stop pretending covid disease exist planet, shall we. Perhaps fact poor people die cholera yellow fever Big Health care risk averse doctors never, ever allow video footage actual ICU conditions shot released. 

The day honest 2 minute video emerges trump state covid-19 ward ICU day even ""conservative Christians"" demand mask codes. FYI, direct links academic papers masks published last three months:

Don’t bother poster. rallying people going grocery store day. can’t keep straight no, CA reopening past months (indoor dining, gyms, etc). That's cases surged. CA shut activities last week, cases start declining weeks again. begged principal this--I'm teacher scared going back break. I’ll big family thanksgiving Christmas New Years! Already Friendsgiving lot friends What’s now, nythro? try find it! I'll back doesnt make outlier didnt say didnt. You’re right. got distracted hungry thinking cheese! heard virologist comparing social distancing masks layers cheese, used it....maybe use different metaphor. usually period something tough, say, know what, paid off....not moment, makes infinitely harder. state stringent mask mandate, closed business limited everything. 

Now infection rate higher Florida. Education mostly controlled state level good thing. NY work amazing education laws. everything needs done nationally. word masks though?

Anyway; looks Big 5 Texan counties biggest problem. goal herd immunity (through infection)

But goal herd immunity infection.

And no. Thats mail says. Oh thanks honey need keep working $1200 gave last month We'll looking critical situation well January I'd say. Even 20-40 million vaccinations January still going get clobbered February hopefully signs slowdown point. partner decided prepare traditional feast us. (Well, turkey cats.)

Doing food prep work week good distraction. pleading public give everything 3 days prior Thanksgiving still big white house celebration. Get fuck outta here. biggest reason believe even great vaccine help. watching America self-importance death. plans inheritance 👀 Confirmed cases meaningless. We're definitely higher list Probability spreading plane insignificant. agree agree got anything say, admit defeat. Well, general, find selfish people ages going you’re describing. question even age group people 55, amount people getting infected COVID matter right? higher age group issue serious outcomes infection infection itself? wrong somewhere? Assuming 1M confirmed cases weekly, even 5% case hospitalization rate, could seeing 50k Americans becoming hospitalized weekly. alarming statistic, forewarning things come. Stay safe everyone. Idea like 1990, think technology assistance act 98. Essentially 20 30 years real meaningful education overhaul. proves point Americans really give shit education, otherwise they'd pushing stronger public education system nationwide. guy later commented saying get information FHM. yes, personal goal may herd immunity Australia gets 8 million international arrivals per year UK’s 35. big difference considering Australia third population. please, explain 8 million arrivals makes “isolated”. Lol Yeah, great headline. article, clear he's saying overthink choice vaccine get, get whichever becomes available first, work similarly. Far likely would skipped invading gone blockading island bombarding air. resultant collapse food distribution would killed many millions. doesnt matter. rukes state cannot change headline talk action, white house can't even follow advise think bothers people 19 countries also top 10%, maybe 1 2 others accounts seemingly dedicated exclusively spread hate misinformation said country.

I assume live New Zealand. reasoning behind interested discussing Sweden affected virus? Relatives? beat football something? arent Thanksgiving anyone already circle two extra Christmas everyone getting tested beforehand. visiting extended relatives grandparents year right, course everyone tries dip hand cookie jar. Here's article interested 

It noted current market rate traveling nurse. nurse working job since day one pandemic getting paid pennies dollar that. fact remember reading article recently nurses striking since hospital even authorize pay increase pandemic ($6/hour raise remember right). population doesn’t normally need medical care...or least hospitalization. Medical advancement mean shorter hospital stays. time hip surgery far less years ago. Conditions required hospitalizations treated outpatient safer. true hospitalizations. hospital safe place try keep people out, shorter whenever possible. say issue administration (and yes, bad administrators need get new career), think hospital afford pay staff equipment typically needed weeks/months year? increase overall costs cover salaries? lay people half year? would like maintaining retail store staff Black Friday year round. It’s sustainable. Last time went Australia show proof vaccination yellow fever, unprecedented, tjry right so. use different cut-off times consider day's new cases... Money, assume. Per person/violation? difference 3,000 killed *""them evil middle eastern people""*.

While 250,000 killed actions GOP Trump, fake news, sports team bad.
