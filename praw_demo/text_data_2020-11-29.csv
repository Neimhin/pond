You touch reality. rural area, impossible find job pays $10/HR. Boomer (just like you!) landlords still think 1980 everything blooming. rent $900 one-bedroom. 

They software engineers making 6 figures year forced live roommates rent outrangous. 

God forbid people want live alone. way hell ever leave roommate again. absolute hell idea people tolerate it. Pushing rope reduce official poverty threshold get numbers back up. 

So minimum wage also stay same. agree. handled ways Western nations would never able to. authoritarianism allowed put total lockdown affected populace. Two teenagers struggled depression anxiety COVID started. One top 3 student big class drop class cried stress school first time ever. much older started taking medication depression. whole thing turned worlds upside down. blame Mitch McConnell rest GOP Senate reaching deal stimulus package don‚Äôt want oversight committee.

Luckily stopped hearing name called. vision slightly trippy short term memory slowly getting worse. I'm also starting lose long term memories like birthdays numbers. never fever cough least.

It's depressing. lost 2 family members inlaw intubated yesterday. I'm bit weary what's come health well others know barely survived. Shit going get real next month two get point hospitals suddenly capacity everywhere once. 

People taking ICU beds granted. Fall, outbreaks regional patients could shuffled around less stressed areas. 

No luck anymore. getting stats from? friends? Lol. know fact I'll take soon available me. Canadian btw. Chronic low level overdose cause kidney stones, acute high level overdose cause liver failure. Might embedded reporter something.

I like woman middle photo sticking tongue camera. Link‚Äôs broken 100%. thought crazy hardly anyone wears mask. one takes seriously. Everything pretty normal months. I‚Äôd say 50% people big stores wear mask pretty much one around town wears one stores. Restaurants, schools, bars open. like simulations.  visit family all... consolation Moderna working mRNA vaccines ages now, even part name.

But consideration decided, governor's fault. far less viable Moderna vaccine developed manufactured America, let's end circlejerk right get harder kiddo. one single day single day. census rapidly growing. convert entire floor today back COVID said soon need another ICU. way happens turn regular unit ICU effectively losing beds regular non-COVID.

Poor people trouble getting contraceptives, abortions, jobs require drug tests. also families separated CPS [loss bodily autonomy minors] often get arrested nonviolent drug crimes higher rates. never going socialize there‚Äôs chance spread flu, killed 80,000 people 2017 (including children). Surely PREVENTABLE social distancing lockdowns.

Or maybe get rid speed limits 40 user said. Car crashes kill 40,000 per year. ever REALLY need drive fast crash fatal. really. Therefore PREVENTABLE too.

Heart disease kills 600,000 year. Much prevented banned unhealthy food. avoid PREVENTABLE DEATH? important trials came America. BioNTech Moderna, level diversity subjects available America, scale available.

Because strength extensiveness test conducted, know works well human, Chinese Caucasians.

Scientist trust trails conducted amongst diverse American population, homogeneous Chinese population.

It's reason America probably approve Oxford's vaccine quickly, also claimed trials include enough ethnic diversity, gender age balance satisfy US regulator, Food Drug Administration.

It matter well vaccine works, able fund perform necessary trials prove works broad set humans, America provides easily nation.

At end day, Pfizer Moderna, America made contribution, whether funding trials, , single country, even combine every European country, successful vaccines. Lets see:

1) ones asking 1.5 years

2) Vaccine nearly ready

3) health risk. That‚Äôs fucking bullshit much different risks 40-hour work week spent desk? Sedentary lifestyles bad, hopefully studies like help change things (sit/stand desks start, overhauling 40 hour work week would better) finally start listening actual doctors advise Dr. Youtube.

All evidence points ""no, won't."" people literally dying COVID insisting hoax they've got something else, die COVID. companies care publicity, they're going make money regardless intentional misleading administration support lie numbers exaggerated virus control

I find hard imagine anything else. Actually, don‚Äôt test people, won‚Äôt see rise number cases. Duh! alone. lived large familial households, usually multi-generational.  Everybody stripper now. wish people safe visiting family saw many families wearing masks social distancing sad flying plane sad. understand people want ""normal"" stressed out, opinion worrying covid make much harder wear mask. don‚Äôt see many severe/acute distress getting started... def sick.

Thanks much advice. appreciate it! I‚Äôm pretty anxious this. guess I‚Äôm torn anxiety step foot inside funeral home feeling badly so. 

It sucks. However, getting sick and/or spreading virus around; giving loved ones ANYone would LOT worse.

I find origin story virus starting much rural area China adjacent Wuhan finally exploding large population Wuhan much believable. agree children‚Äôs education important someone going bar. However, need federal stimulus package ASAP. Also, teachers need get paid more.   sure worked, wouldn‚Äôt case places.  Thats fine too. I'm saying commercial fixed wing flight US / wealthy countries safe put whole families flight without pause. important vaccine delivery, even big one, much different. Thank acknowledging properly informed push theory. extremely important verify information prior posting conspiracy theories. surge surge, surging surges wearing? rumours we've hearing woman, Moderna think? One producer commented quite cold late. Genetic reshuffle outside temp flying 30,000 feet get like -45C removing ""regulation"" temp would actually mean less insulation/etc requirements. whole situation scenario reminding 12 Monkeys  want mf doses finally stop worrying Yes. look another virus cause another outbreak. That‚Äôs helpful info. thought legal weight, outline wishes emergency health proxies. know America‚Äôs actually number one? number one lot health matters LOL See #2. added surges surge surge. That‚Äôs piss people off, end lawsuits higher rates non compliance. think wayy simplifying, also think bit wrong. 


Many states nervous open schools September (justified) fear classrooms would super spreaders.


Now cases spiking, many experts saying keep schools open, least close last. still states talking closure closing schools. think that's function bureaucracy. NY instance, developed metrics closing schools back September. know school seem responsible much spread, hard schools pivot. Massive school systems can't change plans quickly experts change opinions. hoax

This one think nuanced

I think people saying outright exist, fair probably deadly killer pathogen told likely overblown. evil plots

Small businesses crushed, people's livelihoods lost, etc etc etc, single report politician feeling that. I'd love know soon starts working, time doses, find vaccine working, long work, ... share got completely ignored. Also worth noting, travelling 30,000 feet, outside temperature cold enough probably even need regulate temperature much, may need actually INCREASE heat depending vaccine storage/transport requirements get best ideas end rope first many I'm sure. Considering go politicians, millionaires celebrities first yeah celebrities I've worked restaurant. FOH laziest people planet  remember Governor Georgia made headlines staying open. huge story. Atlantic put big scary article calling ‚Äúhuman sacrifice experiment‚Äù something ridiculous. 

Yeah nothing. They‚Äôre worse anyone. about? I‚Äôm looking forward anti-vaxxer groups Facebook. Covid first hitting US March. right outside NYC, knew masks needed, everything reported hundreds falling ill. early thirties almost died. First fevers, breathing started hurt, taken hospital. warped. Nurses doctors practically hazmat gear, little attention hospital filled. quarantine hotel room didn‚Äôt kill family. Second week got much worse. Severe pneumonia CO2 dropped 92/91, wouldn‚Äôt take hospital full. 80s go, already past respiratory failure. capacity literally death‚Äôs door taken in. near best hospitals country. pneumonia got bad could hardly breathe every tiny amount air super painful took make sure didn‚Äôt clot lung. left room hours one tending way call anyone. Nurses barely came room agonizing pain. lungs 70% compromised, CO2 around 94/95 sitting up, lying 90‚Äìrespiratory failure. sent back hotel! probably needed oxygen. given pain pills sent back. Luckily doctor monitored extremely closely afar. three days either going need oxygen/a ventilator get better. Thankfully got better, saw first hand looks like ER full you‚Äôre dying instant, even need serious medical attention. scary. ALREADY ration ventilators beginning pandemic here. Soon rationing medical professionals it‚Äôs pretty. already refrigerators outside hospitals bodies me. It‚Äôs lunacy isn‚Äôt taken seriously. 

This administration politicians allowing complete utter ignorance criminals humanity. mounting evidence.

I understand pharmaceuticals large scale study, profit had. governmental agencies havn't funded one yet beyond me.

The amount required cause issues huge, 10s 1000s IU per day prolonged period.

I recommend Dr John Campbell's Channel YouTube info small studies coming out. Many show huge differences outcome. nursing educator channel Covid, Covid updates around world. Gather round corpse breathe deeply! muh freedoms you‚Äôre badly it‚Äôs obviously choice

I'm sure that's case. 

I would happy get behind elimination strategy, politics plays big role that. Nations eliminate COVID control borders tightly, maybe domestic borders well. also population sympathetic willing go along restrictions. 

If government understands eliminate COVID knows population breach orders significantly fail, government (or indeed, anyone meaningful deliberate sense) choosing outcome. know ELISA test used.

There lot tests went positive common cold coronaviruses. Yes, will. also significant disadvantage compared children get in-person education. survival, individual risk also 1%, depend son age co comorbidities.
There's also long covid, according CDC affects 5% people matter mild server symptoms start leave pretty much bed many months possibly longer. extreme fatigue common, many symptoms. 
As yet know people get road not. virus causing long term issues body cleared it.  People seem absolutely convinced someone household it, everyone else automatically MUST there's point taking precautions.

Attack rate households lower think. they'd made people aware possible REALLY lower chances catching family member wearing masks contact necessary, using separate bathrooms etc. even already contact without precautions, could made people cautious. It‚Äôs statistics thing. Models always using confidence intervals, probability trend random always calculated. statistic never 100% convention, language rarely uses definitive language. cases probability less 1%, still don‚Äôt see anything states certain. typical threshold 5% less assume trend isn‚Äôt random. 

I find frustrating lack conviction language seems taken form validity dissent. becomes game sounds certain, idiots always loudest room. reliably identify 1% need protecting? answer covid damn simple. Governments need provide basic guaranteed income every citizen, enforcing draconian lock-down, mask, distance measures every citizen given mandatory vaccination exceptions. that, covid beaten nation within one month. Guard reintroduction outside, over. One month fully supported lock everyone get back relative normality.

But nation willing this! frustrating! brother got it. strange read comments here. guys aware majority countries strict restrictions since March? Whilst seems states starting anything now. America example looked concerning virus left unchecked. asked would feel take classes times? F keep it, many emigrating USA helping staff hospitals. Would y'all consider people work home healthcare/nursing homes frontline, frontline mean amazing staff working actively sick people?

I hope forget us country folk rural areas, I'm scared they're gonna Yeah, we‚Äôre looking guidance Sweden.  I'm electrician, I've taken last weeks (with go) stay home wife new baby. I'm fucking terrified go back work demographic construction workers happens line really well people taking shit seriously. go back work bunch guys almost certainly going avoiding holiday gathering. won‚Äôt argue that, it‚Äôs shitty system try survive of. people falling left right, would videos facebook. Indian media (themselves type virus ask me) would like nobody's business.  nowhere else country 328 million people? There‚Äôs refrigerated trucks El Paso recently moved new location away hospital. We‚Äôre talking pandemic monumental proportions here.

The numbers don‚Äôt lie. Look total deaths per year US reported CDC. posted above. Travel nurses already making much now. absolute insanity. sick. schools promote extremely toxic peer socialization though. There's lot work society seems. It‚Äôs almost like science learning adapting problem. So, like, death panel think lot resistance asking people stay home holidays. could changed ask people go crowded places, drive family park holiday. scheme August UK (you know, defeated virus) get people go restaurants, 1/2 price (¬£10/per person) funded government 100%. stupid people everywhere, honestly surprised ferocity group stupidity displayed US parts Europe.

The complaints even 'lockdown make broke' totally sensible argument. 'you can't tell do' 'pay stay home, need earn feed family. long eat I'll stay wherever'. Madness. It‚Äôs shame, love Florida nature weather place right now. random strangers, people friends family case. It‚Äôs getting frustrating see selfish reckless behaviors I‚Äôm starting think relationship this. Impressive. Last week saw truck bandages unload front apothecary. never late right thing.

No right thing depends time. Lol, think 2024. I'm aware that, one parents actually worked one companies while. mean say *only* US good logistics, say logistics US impresses me. Logistics places impresses too. Saying US good something saying place good US best. perhaps 1% (elderly) worry rest 99% society. mean, gasp!, he's politician?! they, that. react. that's reason send kids school now? babysit? really? that‚Äôs super interesting me.... pry, serious want elaborate, would love hear more. letter kids ready, case die alone, stuff would want hear weren‚Äôt around go. Thanks! anything amount ""sHeEpLe,"" ""TyRaNnY,"" ""mUh FrEeDuMs"" etc. flying around fb least doubled since election. 

nothing say effect kind change willfully pridefully ignorant 115 daily case 6-million population city abysmal east asia standards. 

HongKong mismanaged COVID-19 response badly 1)incompetent leadership 2)Citizens complying 3)dissidents hellbent taking HK them. Funny, hospitals sure filling fast real hotspot... skip whole year altogether instead? force children/kids study highly stressful time? definitively case Sweden.

One interesting questions hindsight me, could predicted fast vaccine development could happen. Like vaccine, easy see could done, could predicted spring sitting winning lottery ticket possibly predicted?  fact soon president talking vaccines ""cure all"" around corner help either. still plenty time die this, people.  expert field longer inbred ass alive rather believe random uninformed person like more. Going bloodbath holiday sales. probably would bought PS5, new TV, bike/tablet kiddo Corona.

Now, celebrating 'spirit' Christmas year stocking items small stuff. sure information readily available. think people hear Bill Gates vaccine sentence think I‚Äôm antivax conspiracy nut. fuck? literally life capitalism. Twit. pfizer ceo sold 62% shares day released vaccines tho? It‚Äôs hard throw hands hope economy completely tanks stick fcker‚Äôs asses. know that‚Äôs cutting nose spite face, don‚Äôt wish all, people done nothing quell this‚Äîonly stoke flames it!!‚Äîdeserve much shit.

That's pretty standard. first lockdown UK loads people complaining ""People taking seriously, drove beach today packed"" Jeez pay half rent two bedroom 585 :(. I‚Äôm also Chicago lol protect others fall 1% That‚Äôs insult 25,000 New Yorkers already died COVID healthcare workers families suffered trauma. actually follow linked article section see nyt reporting, says BioNTech brought Pfizer even started quickly identified 20 vaccine candidates, began testing rodents. company lacked experience resources rapidly conduct major clinical trial. Mr. Sahin called Pfizer. two companies working develop flu vaccine since 2018, within day Mr. Sahin calling Dr. Jansen Pfizer, companies agreed partner coronavirus vaccine. Even live US, depend global logistics. buy even made US. made US requires often parts overseas.

And logistics btw. even US dominated. 

The largest 3rd party logistics provider worldwide DHL SP&amp;GF, subsidiary Germany's Deutsche Post. Second largest ist Kuehne + Nagel, also Germany. comes Nippon Express Japan, German company, DB Schenker (a subsidiary Deutsche Bahn, German railroad company) C.H. Robinson US rank 5. UPS ranking 9th, FedEx rank 37th. worst pandemic lifetimes *so far* age group group probably staying most. Asymptomatic carriers likely spread thing most. 

The idea long hauler makes careful well. 

Look, get saying. Friends really important mental health. I‚Äôm losing mind little bit, ok? coworkers mostly assholes significant interactions year. depressing. met friend, outside, two weeks ago. great time. helped. 

Now buckle winter. Let‚Äôs take care community ourselves. countries bracing avoid second third wave, America actively trying mimic one wave pools see water parks. Ha went covid testing center performing tests receptionists weren‚Äôt wearing masks right. shocked. went pretty much knowing positive felt awful going saw that. cough mid test put mask real quick. Well came chyna third customers work wear mask nowadays put heads protective screen order, breathing right fucking face I'm allowed turn away. work grocery store go work, mom's, home. I'm day 4 covid feels worse real bad case pneumonia. Fuck. Pray give mom y'all. feel fucking dumb angry. lol That‚Äôs media telling us. Stupid people exist everywhere, seen people anti mask anti lockdown. America really cracked stupid 11. another level stupid.

I thought italy 3rd world countries bad. knew America would get bad. 

I knew lockdowns almost impossible US ""Freedom"". stupidity way expected. love many witnesses coronavirus task force confiscate airplanes cargo takes time drop. Look long plateaued first lockdown (the first peak would higher one testing level, drop still slow).

Nothing seems stay market month. Interest rates low good (700+) credit, you‚Äôd silly consider buying right now. 

And that‚Äôs thing: would need good, strong financial position take advantage interest rates credit market tightening fast. 

GenX bought houses immediate aftermath ‚Äò08. They‚Äôre alright. Younger millennials shielded extent ‚Äò08 crisis. But, Oregon Trail Millennials? ones graduating college/grad school ‚Äò08-‚Äò10 entering job market (what jobs?)? Many forced work degree fields, delaying journey stable careers. seems like many friends starting get groove career path allowing accumulate enough money make payment. Now? Everyone seems skittish, haunted ‚Äò08. 

I looking buying house last year. know qualify for. It‚Äôs barely enough buy outskirts, it‚Äôs enough. It‚Äôs enough repairs would done properties, though. God forbid major storm comes through. 

And, point, government continuing treat stock market gold standard economic indicators, time new model, luxury cars mile long food pantry lines - seems like big gamble. doesn‚Äôt help local economy heavily reliant hospitality industry, knee-capped end sight. 

My parents happy. IRAs growing ‚Äòsafe‚Äô. older, GenX siblings comfortable homes, enjoying growing families. But, cat? We‚Äôre hoping rents stable years. student loan forgiveness thing would godsend, I‚Äôm betting it. Maybe I‚Äôll buy house 40 instead 34. 

That... went places. GenZ, y‚Äôall okay? fair though, reasons believe news example China angled way? Agreed. kids 18-24 taking seriously. son voluntarily spent 21st birthday home wasnt willing risk bringing covid home. None kids gone single public activity gone without mask since March.

If college age kids capable understanding basic safety instructions, business arming thanking enlisting. I'm Scotland went zoo friend son's birthday Saturday, fully within rules, strictest tier country (level 4). [And cases still dropping fast first seems like pretty good news me. better question anything learned stop happening again? tell ""Eat Help Out"" sounds like... imagine can‚Äôt follow rules outside work, she‚Äôs probably breaking rules comes patient care also. friends grandma die COVID nurse nursing home brought in. roommate already died it. hate people. would someone take vaccine something 99% survival rate One extremely vital thing consider capacity beds taken hospital, acuity patients beds. Acuity determines widely spread staff get patients. Someone mend broken leg, example, generally require much less care someone problematic illness like COVID CDIF, cause patients quickly worsen.

Think even simple terms: think put strain: Hospital A, 500 beds, 400 filled fairly standard distribution sick people, Hospital B, 500 beds, 250 filled, 200 beds ebola cases? Hospital B might places put patients level care patients need (likely 1:1, meaning one nurse per patient) means going significantly strained likely completely capacity.

COVID extremely problematic many people hospitalized pretty serious cases require higher level care. Please stop old folks' tales. seriously can't imagine awful would forced put another human death.

Like really? can't even get respite deathbed?! enough think 'smart' states gather dump 'dumb' states. Problem would endless influx 'dumb' state refugees 'smart' states. Living Communist regime like link low vitamin bad COVID-19 outcomes established fact. Lots people parroting social media make true - actual research that. actually talking someone works company testing vaccines Pfizer, said would go nursing homes first.

The context actually calling let know scheduled appointment vaccine study next week postponed, least January, possibly indefinitely. asked possible they‚Äôd still testing vaccine rolled out, said wasn‚Äôt actually sure. Even feasible, require four months total lockdown do. likely significant proportion vulnerable vaccinated four months.

There's point now. like Americans someone tries take sole credit collaborative effort?

Yes I'm German feel free feel validated seriously, would great opportunity recognize international collaborations amazing things. be. 400 people closely packed together Black Friday Walmart, that's OK! US so, Europe so... China advanced nation not? technology this.

Yes count everything.. like election important statistics or.. oh wait none done well China either. curious - evidence going send people home die? Hahahahhahaha Gee maybe sub tried stop people traveling Black Friday OH WAIT 

Only Holidays cause spike cases. political riots big corporation sponsored days, thinking Theyre wearing masks riding bikes lol? blame rolling eyes. causal connection established. still hypothetical.

By means, take doctor-recommended dose, aware link low vitamin bad COVID-19 outcomes not, right now, established fact. There's also another one called *infect baby one time*. Imagine someone GTA heists shit lol sorry I've gaming much isolation $200B normal military expenditure think normal budget? 

The US budget grotesque, entirely unnecessary. 50% less demand oil, Middle Eastern wars would happened. Maybe different face face death... Nobody cares us, saving retarded cousin.  Sell, they're still MDs know basics. they'd need complex anyway could definitely need be. Cosmetic surgeons regular doctor stuff even board specialty. plastic surgeon nose jobs face lifts likely board certified ENT surgeon example also medically necessary nasal surgeries needed too. They'd less useful specialist respect. Yea mah freedumbs? can't breath tissue face! oxygen levels drop! killing wear 15 minutes store!! call pro-plaguers too. I‚Äôll also continue compare conspiracy theorists like 9/11 Truthers help yourselves. Ofc prattle disrespectful something hold funeral, chances another die learn nothing proceed repeat process ad nauseum. Dolly Pardon Betty White Thanks Trump admin getting Americans. know full ramifications disease years.

I think preliminary data come sooner, maybe year. yeah, seems like pretty. I'm child therapist. 30 different kids virtual school right sister teacher. think I'm pretty well versed subject. dont call ""Pfizer's vaccine"" ? *""So y'all celebrating year?""*

*""Death.""* I'm glad there's info progress chinese vaccines well pfizer's production 2021 already reserved West. listen experts saying election rigged DJT won? Exactly. finding people take serious masking etc., learning infected loved one died? Bro, Trump flag showing.

Literally noone saying US/Pfizer nothing comes vaccines. I'm teacher, extremely high risk. want vaccine ASAP. However, br making informed decision based every shred information get legitimate sources one vaccines become available, discussing specialist physician. 

Rushed vaccines make nervous. would much rather watch least weeks initial vaccinations and, unexpected complications arise, get vaccine. Lives worth living, setting aside millennial pioneered jokes.

The world scary awful sometimes, beauty meaning found. Let's make better next lot. didn't. never late. Like calm period summer. 

Yes, do. Sweden laws western country. absolutely nothing unique Swedish law.

I care that. Sweden liberal. neoliberal. La la la - ‚ÄúThe man ate 1000 RITS‚Äù Gucci belt opened schools. Yes, exactly. Sometimes adults take make right decisions! Good you! don‚Äôt want sound grim, feel like America needs that. people ignoring scientists doctors hard facts believing dude Facebook never went college. make people watch family members slowly die home understand listen people actually went school years kind topic, sure shit reached it. I‚Äôm happy feel like we‚Äôve tried everything convince people great scientists like Fauci know talking about. feel like dying every hour day see wearing mask important feel sympathy you. bet even won‚Äôt convince people virus serious. They‚Äôll still go outside mask, they‚Äôll still say it‚Äôs flu even though mere breaths away deaths door. It‚Äôs fucked. season going hard one sit through. decided restrictions pointless mean are. Especially they've achieved results 4 weeks.


But ohhhh horror going 31 days total, 28. Book cant that. cares hospitals packed people dieing, unnecessary stuff weeks important people's lies. give us credible sources didn‚Äôt eat French Laundry lobbyists, tho Fuck man, hurts read. I've enjoyed lot Mike's content year yeah post singlehandedly took away much respect guy. couple friends, twelve bimbos bottles champagne. bad taste. Thanks! yes plenty articles thanks, meant specifically zombies Sounds like good man Dr. Mike sanctioned workplace this? He's putting patients' lives danger.  took little time find fully prepared support global market demand potential Covid-19 vaccines signed long-term purchase agreement Corning.

Sorry shit doom porn, one issue. Cant retrained help treat flow patients. It‚Äôs ad hominem attack. 

Again, literally want point budget got low literally resulted deaths. normal budget UK? Maybe so. Maybe like 1997. 

Also, developed oil independence years ago. 

Also, government isn‚Äôt one investing efficient energy. US got one largest jumps climate change development tech world since 2001 that‚Äôs timeline. 

Also, world would put strategic position? Don‚Äôt confuse lack action deterrence. 

Again, mindset clearly spend yearly budget standing around sternly desert guns drone strikes. everyone thinks military doesn‚Äôt actually know reads lame budget arguments rile voters. 

You want mad budget? #1 US budget expenditure item - healthcare. gets flushed what? Administrative waste? Nurses people too, suck much rest. work retail asked lady distance since space, threw tantrum reported manager (who basically told gtfo) claiming nurse weirdo. So. Y‚Äôknow. |: one wants die alone.

I do. don‚Äôt. you? know someone highschool nurse, took virus seriously, shared arduous spell virus basically said should‚Äôve ICU, wasn‚Äôt basically access medicine support needed. shared story help people around understand serious is. believe Tianjin:
http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-11/20/c_139530089.htm battles conspiracy nuts learned attack fake news, confirm beliefs. 

A psychologist friend mine trying save wasting time people explained like this.

Conspiracy nuts taught mainstream media, elites (if includes lizard people know) deep state / new world order people (don't ask sht even means) trying desperately hide (fill whatever) them. time fight back lock us cages take away every last one rights. 

The nuts warned, ""they"" (this might refer lizard people well) try use media social media hide truth, fooled.

So think happens try counter conspiracy nut? confirm told someone try change mind.

There undoing conspiracy nut, get themselves. go counter conspiracies get people believe them. I‚Äôm hairstylist job made hate people before. good ones LOT suck. think it‚Äôs reference Poe‚Äôs story ‚Äúthe masque red death.‚Äù It‚Äôs mentioned frequently connection coronavirus. I‚Äôm sure people selfish, plain stupid, denial situations. I‚Äôve heard many cases someone waiting test result yet continues see people like everything fine. even worse, knowing direct exposure someone tested positive, continuing see people, informing possible risk next say. disclose shit someone decide want risk? Someone know picked kid ex‚Äôs, ex call 45 minutes later tell kid‚Äôs step dad tested positive. Jesus Christ it‚Äôs infuriating. Happy you. post removed because:

I live north Da'covid governor gave go ahead nurses keep working long asymptomatic... 
It's ridiculous. 

My wife ER RN blew news came out. reckon trillions pumped stock market earlier year came from? Oh yeah, money printers. went stock buybacks. Imagine went people instead. call group invented it? USS Comfort refused take COVID patients. accept overflow conditions. Around redefine ""exposure"" every time gets inconvenient. long take Centrum I‚Äôm good ?  proof herd immunity. It‚Äôs wanting make lot money devoid purpose intention. experience goes right hand hand ‚Äúreckless twat‚Äù. saying is, happened nation high likelihood anything it. Right nice knowing you. disagree!

Sensible great updates vaccine development. used watch video nutrition meat pork healthy video sponsored pork industry.

Like get nutrition videos controversial general everyone agrees. I‚Äôm always curious funds study whenever nutrition. obviously doesn‚Äôt care that. Someone scheduled extra long weekend. Christmas though..



I friend ask wanted go Thanksgiving party like ... No? neither you. I'm amazed care anymore


She's normally pretty smart things becoming normal. People feeling relatively safe again. Ive locked get vaccine purposely leave protesting contact tracing. one cares tho. fear mongering bs. teaspoons Chia Seeds 2 slices wheat bread got hump.

No way know actual magnesium content foods. Additionally lectins wheat bread chia seed block magnesium absorption. playoffs need bubble somewhere like LA multiple stadiums use hotel capacity. Rose Bowl, Coliseum, Banc California front it, new Rams one, Galaxy one Carson. Like NBA MLB NHL.  possible hospitals temporarily expand capacity things like setting patient beds hallways. (I know guy got pretty badly injured slipping ice unusually bad snowstorm. hospital area could handle surgery needed packed similar patients; able operate, lay bed hallway afterwards.)

However, still need enough trained staff deal patients beds. every hospital state also running capacity, like borrow ICU nurses them. Force test politicians, scientists med personnel first. Let's see long BS lasts. Yes ‚Äì part transmission particles greatly reduced viral load goes it.

It‚Äôs viral load makes people sick.

If everyone wearing masks ones get sick far likely asymptomatic otherwise.

Those asymptomatic even less likely pass they‚Äôre wearing masks too.

This research around months.

In Australian state Victoria we‚Äôve seen high levels mask usage stop COVID spreading. It‚Äôs month since new cases.

Although masks may 100% perfect, they‚Äôre far behind amazing tool stopping prevention. always something Dr. Mike me. Like narcissistic traits going put finger on. smile sweet personality made feel like someone trying little hard make people like think ""good guy"" know people hard time accepting this. Even Twitter bans people stating fact. fact ONE confirmed reinfection since start pandemic. One. 13M total known cases US alone. people least brief period immunity recovering we'd able find one case entire world. Got agree you, feel bit pessimistic too. Still weeks restrictions that, hopeful number continues fall. personally I‚Äôm sitting Christmas year. I‚Äôll hopefully see family months, vulnerable parents vaccinated. nephews California haven‚Äôt classroom since last March. They‚Äôre really struggling. It‚Äôs awful. Oh teachers know posted multiple photos traveling staycation-ing outside state yet REFUSE even teach 1 2 days week classroom smaller class sizes. Absolutely hypocritical. I‚Äôm glad Fauci said this, lost two friends 20+ years posting similar sentiment June choose Matrix! ask everywhere nobody answers. virus man made not?!?! health teachers faculty staff important. parents guardians step bit more. never thought second government pfizer best intentions - know care virus ending asap via safe vaccine - economic growth, thats enough motivation possess comfortable trials product. Honest question- possible teachers higher risk able teach home/stay home lower risk teachers able come in? Allow families high risk choice? said I‚Äôm watching private schools wealthy suburban areas public schools open public schools areas kids need free lunch closed. know kids losing vital academic progress- sometime done. Also think teachers essential workers cashiers many workers making min wage are. 
(Also min wage $15 hour teachers make more). People stop caring make rent lost jobs. Depends live. work large hospital mid sized city. room keep opening new units, getting point new units soon need offsite. Offering sign-in bonuses extra medical support staff need. lucky ones. 

Now travel mins city center, things change bit. Rural hospitals ability flex-up like do. Adding another 20 beds much bigger deal 40 bed hospital vs 500 bed one. strained past capacity weeks. can't simply transfer everyone us waves contend with. Yey, hyperexponetial growth! /s  understand all. Online classes new thing college students. graduated 2013 took tons classes online, even still taking person classes. Heck, tons people would take 3-4 online classes summer break. Lots people, including myself, traditional campus students still probably got 20% credits online classes. Heck, lots classes specifically took online knew would easier. 


Why people suddenly struggling much? big surprise. Half California doesn‚Äôt work. Unfortunately us taking seriously beginning little stop others. Thank god project warp speed 13 billion dollar incentive get end year, unbelievable. 1 million cases worldwide lot.. might 11, might detected 11 imported, another 89 asymtomatic community, even 989 going around. goes every country.

If China silent outbreak, Vietnam also massive border China fine? Vietnam-China border lot people living there, unlike India-China border nobody lives there. depends mean that, ""doesn't much immune system"" could mean vaccine effective her. also safety issue. done clinical trials children risk-benefit ratio, approved children, doctors can't make exceptions. long discover results within 15 minutes starting meeting fine. Thank :) governments bad repect foreign policy, involvement big business, treatment workforce poort, healthcare etc etc.

One also terrible treating truth unimportant unheard degree. waiting find placebo group get vaccinated early. personally know much want stay study - quitter - bow early get vaccine dont tell us group placebo get it. words matter what, im getting vaccinated soon can, dont find already.

i wasnt nervous it. Ive never reactions vaccines medication except bactrim causes oral thrush, thats it. dont strong allergies anything. wasnt worried safety vaccine. 

i get headache 36 hours shots - never get headaches - perhaps get it. Ok Lisa rinna Thanks! told sister. Exactly. Even non-traveler, could take time off, grab travel gig somewhere, come back later staff nurse... hard 1+ yrs exp. happening lot nyc. lot underground parties going on. 18- 26 crowd packing places Good thing Trump immune now. terrible ‚Äî athletes coaches get tested front line workers can‚Äôt Covid test!

WTF going on? Enough this. one needs warned now. people care happens them. Government part cause, cause - lot things wrong politics, entrenched tribalism rejects science favour belief lack critical thinking part problem well. Noem said responsibility lies counties. counties SD mask requirements? Noem's washed hands issue. says personal responsibility.

So fact blaming people South Dakota? How's make feel?

Stay safe! Looks like it‚Äôs happening Iowa surrounding states degree. number hospitalized going now, rural hospitals sending metro hospitals, supposedly begging transfer more, metro hospitals sending people home oxygen quite while, beds, think they‚Äôre fairly breaking point regards staffing.

I‚Äôve heard administrative employees medical credentials pulled back actual healthcare duty. I‚Äôm sure staffing funding fill many beds.

Schools important bars. said bar workers need pay rent looks stimulus won‚Äôt happen anytime soon say keep bars open feel fine going. Also afford buy gift cards- basically small interest free loan keep bar afloat help pay staff. Yea, stupid, people. government well.

Granted think one side least slight blame that's another discussion COVID-19 likely take longer time, effectively defeat it, available new methods, vaccines, etc.!  ""I'm science..."" suits me.  


Fuck considering person rational example prudent caution. That‚Äôs year Jan first vaccine coming. soon. wait more. live Oregon, went ER family member 2-3 months ago. waiting lobby nurse came chat another person waiting room. totally pulled mask conversation person. bro bar like 2 months. *my* mental health?? /s find difficult believe would actually anything negligible effect numbers. Obviously, we're going prioritize closes stays open, schools stay open bars. let's honest, going even worth effort? 
I'm surprised schools close right Thanksgiving solid plan open New Year. People going get virus spread holidays least schools (a major hub spread) would closed obvious high density infection periods. Isnt clear hospital works at. nurse tells family mine live next covid big deal.

This still proven. I'd say *very likely* reduces 90% more, still incredible, world-changing result. agree. really. I'm part sign volunteer. likely prioritized us high risk exposure, anything, cautious rest population. 

The fact volunteered means taking virus seriously, value health using masks precautions. I'm also elderly, black Hispanic. surprised study came back low numbers. would think would need random sample population better results volunteers. I'm stats guy scientist knows. free discussion thread dude Morons sub took fact people self-restricted mobility reason believe Covid would magically dissappear 10% population got infected. stupid wrong. still are. know known there's middle ground combination restricted behavior heterogenous spread reduces R0 1.

We've lots great vaccine news first shot take place? ten millionth? answer questions like know rate changes happen welcome live way forever! High level government officials absolutely first get it. guarantee Trump entire staff dose waiting already. bad thing. remember seeing blurbs routine back spring.

Libertarians like cats, think independent litterbox full. can't inject someone virus potentially kill  guy infected dumb. yeah, seem go back life Covid 2021 yet unless force vaccinations :( Ah sorry! Honestly really hard tell days lol apparently taking care incentive nowadays SMH importantly, doctors nurses *involved patient care* first. think nurse administrator seen patient 30 years get vaccine essential workers. Healthcare workers actual patient interactions first. Doctors, nurses, rad techs, evs, lab staff, registration, hospital security. close second firefighters, medics, cops. Third essential workers subdivided industry. Grocery stores, pharmacies, public transit top list followed things like public works, water department, etc. circle back hospital administrators start vaccinating general public. 

They're going need nuanced precise descriptions prevent people abusing system. would spent Thanksgiving parents done year since Pandemic began:

- Masks times
- Meals different tables
- Social distancing much possible
- Defer long conversations back porch door open parents sit inside outside air flowing. 

I close contact (my entire team got infected, somehow not, tested negative confirm, 2 week quarantine ended friday). happened, would likely gone home visited manner described above.

The major issue number Thanksgiving gatherings last week likely took place table, big family, neighbors bumping elbows. talking, eating, breathing, one infected member likely produced nice cloud viral particles. think that‚Äôs important people get quick possible start telling friends it‚Äôs bad they‚Äôll take it.. like domino effect.

Got excited lol waiting Dec 17 meeting, every day delayed another 1000 grave.. I'm curious know timing. cases represent people one month getting vaccine could swarming antibodies. immune system changes couple months I'm curious see lack severe cases continues vaccine arm. That's impossible. never get compliance necessary, besides, things necessary survival entail leaving house. People work power plants grocery stores cannot stay home six weeks. would cut people life. governments aint shit.

Perfect framing dilemma. actually think logic holds, assumes 11 infections look like 11 infections control population vaccinated. expect case. think logic also tries treat infection severity independent variables independent. large decrease symptomatic infection, would expect large decrease severity well since molecular mechanism immunity basically mechanism keeps getting severely ill (antibodies).

The FDA historically rolling reviews, means get data one big dump, unlike nations, get data pieces review come in. FDA take longer review data nations.

But don‚Äôt give people idea getting Covid better vaccine. hospitals already fucked. last thing need millennials thinking natural immunity better ending hospital hits harder think Ah, okay.

Everyone testing vacine 98.41% chance survive 1.41% better odds survive jus getting covid straight up. Ofcourse participants know thoose odds, effectivenes vacine unknow, duhh.

If vacine really effective everyone vacinated 99.82% chance surviving covid. assuming media doesnt lie covid mortality pharmacists doesnt lie vacine effectiveness, highly doubt thoose cases true, shouldnt really far (I hope so) Depends demographics cases.  presumably get number factoring bunch asymptomatic cases.

Obviously, last thing I'd want people infected. Thanks links, advice sources. People get mad say this, true. rate we're currently going we're going reach herd immunity vaccine becomes widely available. obviously good it, going late save many lives. reach 70% immunity like 55% infected 15% vaccine. Everyone limit.

Nine months best years people's lives, sacrificed slightly extend lives old, sick, obese.

At point, people reach breaking point. infection leads immunity, least probably year, maybe more.

I think issue infections result level immunity difficult make blanket statement says ""infected people immune."" known sure much immunity granted person act like they've vaccinated received positive COVID test. It‚Äôs fairly sound immunity conferred CoVID19 infection. People valid reasons wanting annual flu shot (or even wanting first line Covid vaccine). anti-vaxx.

They overestimating cases dont catch Yep give condition completely control (in many cases). stay good shape don‚Äôt burden healthcare system ones get last. Really pisses reading wrong?

If remember correctly(I might wrong) J&amp;J CEO said plan apply approval February. Pfizer gunning week Moderna close behind. Plan use vaccines medical personnel, like nurse, month(December). Pfizer(or Moderna) vaccine came hospital would reject it, right? wait J&amp;J approval February. choice personally understand it, honestly.(If read situation correctly)

For doctor, yeah. agree. could easily waited approval days Pfizer would given vaccine. Yes vitamin hydroxychloroquine. taking winter anyway, especially elderly dark skinned. hurt take moderate doses, help even turned Covid highly unlikely.

Also doses need seriously looking at. dose UK gov recommends way decades stop rickets, know used body far bone health, including parts inflammation management.

That said take large doses unless doctors supervision. admit it... FAT GUY!!! I'm morbidly obese anything, get around fine health problems (yet... gotta work that).

That said, refuse get vaccine early weight. getting one wife, family, friends members general public able get it. obese is, certain extent, lifestyle choice. admit drink much damned coca-cola cut junk food, could reach healthy weight. believe obese people get jump line obese. Awesome He's worse us trial. fact, he's probably better get free testing anytime trial. Anti vaccine one things far right meets far left. Far right religious nuts put faith god. Far left reject modern medicine it‚Äôs ‚Äúnatural.‚Äù go fuck themselves. work healthcare certainly understand that. Disclaimer: I'm data scientist medical expert. understand, reason trials take long need many peopl DONT give covid.

Essentially: half injected trial vaccine half placebo, monitor participants relatively long time go regular lives. time period long enough subset people get naturally infected covid. hope everyone infected covid, given placebo vaccine, case know vaccine effective.

As corollary, also need many participants (30, 000 people according article) dataset infected people needs large enough make statistical claims - 196 30,000 people gotten covid, imagine less people trial. I'm edge. mean stay 30.1 BMI risk falling put line? 'dire straits' btw BmI UsElEsS

All sudden, HAES people going become familiar class obesity fall into. American Food Pyramid wrong. People forgot humans ate 200 years ago. Oof, see upsetting lot people.  sacrifice anything. Actually probably better trial, get free testing. got placebo lived life caught virus wild. give virus part trial.

We're number 1, we're number 1!  enough people dont get vaccinated dealing lockdowns years too! i'm vaccinations that's pretty pathetic ""my neighbour obsessed laundry, day long, every day"" never made argument saying help. pointed headline bit ridiculous. That's exactly I'm getting vaccine. took off! It‚Äôs going bad, question. point try convince someone already done 100 times stop, survivorship bias probably prevail persuasion virus hive mind parasite enslave humans.

Can't imagine retired medical professional would want unless death wish. simply nobody wants die, deep virus threaten them. think simple that.

It's easier believe school shootings, pandemics whatever else farces makes us literally feel safer.  contrary think would effective say something like ""I'll take vaccine show proof mean ""rights""?

I admit little arbitrary, mean able fly go bar restaurant go concert without prove took something fully sure wanted take. sets bad precedent; fear it'll create even problems social cohesion. Something like ""I'm vaccinated COVID not, therefore I'm superior"". get that's bit far fetched days nothing outlandish.

 also worry privacy. health records eyes doctor only. sort digital thing prove vaccinated means records remotely accessed someone probably looking them.

If turns temporary measure, I'll feel bit less nervous it, stay I'm point blank refusing vaccine, simple. Yeah anecdotal evidence probably shouldn‚Äôt listened to. guess meant lot people like made far, lecturing danger far probably won‚Äôt much. Well that's fascinating! also feeling.

Adderall doesn‚Äôt make high metabolism, makes eating food feel gross.

That said know quite people diagnosed ‚ÄúI take thyroid pills doctor says to‚Äù thyroid problems, really sucks see struggle. I'm stopping pandemic slowing down. feel uneasy essentially letting public test subjects. 6 months long enough see potential side effects vaccine even completely understand virus. I'm lucky enough low risk catching it. I'm gonna wait months see happens. worth stay home masked potential life long side effect.

I fully vaccinated get flu shot every year. vaccinations. know lot shady shit went rushing vaccine straight money grab. people suffer this. FDA get sued years know someone effected covid end 2021. seatlbelt example perfect. know anyone died vaccine, likely heard exact thing someone else, heard someone else, read Facebook.

Hypothetically speaking... agree you. 

My point none scientific fact, yet, still hypothetical. 

Assumption based. peer reviewed factual scientific evidence contrary. Therefore assumptions hold unreasonable make scientific facts peer reviewed confirm assumptions fact. 

Complex language amounts ifs maybe persuade otherwise. 

Furthermore seems unethical irresponsible people predict cure prevention factually exists. wrong. people we‚Äôre worried dropping placebo group, aren‚Äôt eligible vaccine trial over. Specifically, article hear two healthcare workers signed get vaccine early, upset got placebo. break agreement get vaccinated anyway, trial less reliable results compare line. Yeah. single week. never developed vaccine stop common cold

But this? 

I'll sit while. 

I want know long term effects.

Not enough info 

Jmo rules side effects. 5 people trial strokes 3 getting placebo rule strokes potential side effect. didn‚Äôt placebo group couldn‚Äôt rule out. usual holiday effect. saw something similar July 4th.

I many associates private residence choose.

You bend want to. None ideal. Saving lives possible simply best solution bad situation. vaccinating irresponsible party goer effective route reduce spread therefore save people path take. saves lives reducing overall spread, also reduce number people get sick recover permanent organ damage.

Well Oxford's vaccine global production superior everyone else. issue US Pharma fairly pricing vaccine poorer countries access it.

http://www.masonohioschools.com/covid-19 That's even remotely true. assume hospitals list ""available beds,"" they're simply counting mattresses. guess would factor personnel capacity ""available bed"" numbers. I'm sure many hospitals extra beds stacked storage rooms, example, they're going say available patients.

Maybe I'm wrong, am, that's really silly way go it. national ""leadership"" put effort supposed elections illegitimacy acknowledging covid big deal. continues try fudge numbers. say need antibodies whatever something else.

Well I‚Äôve noticed since then, time time I‚Äôll start randomly coughing fits chest starts burn. never used happen me. 

It doesn‚Äôt happen lot I‚Äôd say maybe 1-3 times spread across two weeks. doesn‚Äôt seem happen anything particular. still physical exercise breathe fine. laying bed it‚Äôll still happen. 

The coughing doesn‚Äôt last long randomly it‚Äôll happen like 5-10 minutes after, chest feels like it‚Äôs fire. Like heartburn lungs. 

Anyone know that‚Äôs kind long term effect Covid? never used happen life. asthma something develop later life? I‚Äôve never asthma. allergies? I‚Äôve never really issue allergies either.

Mine Giant Eagle (our supermarkets) Hallmark thank you.  see, bars make money children cost money. It‚Äôs simple mathematics. 

Have children run bars. Schools teachers better funded they've ever been. districts highest per student spending worst nation.

Governor Newsom kids' school open goes lobbyist parties, public schools closed. isnt science. 13.4M cases US, one would expect average response case would generate less reaction vaccines. mimic response severe infection higher levels biomarkers. let's assume vaccine efficacy holds nearly true ~94% people infected durable immunity. leaves **800,000** likely vulnerable reinfection. Even seeing tens thousands reinfections across nation would something panic about. 


Maybe video help clear things. channel doctor many, many times gone Vitamin studies misleading people know read studies.  


I recommend watch video see clearer picture it.  What's consensus people antibodies?

Don't risk it? Set good example? want? spot already discussed approved get vaccine first, glad i‚Äôm end line, want see pans vaccine causes issues doors open service? could half half masks doubled up, still get say goodbye. 

Do know extended graveside service? Eat rich Time weld people‚Äôs doors shut. Money talks work drug delivery getting reason developed/approved quickly. vaccine developed vector around would mRNA relatively new vector Moderna working past 10 years products show for. think draw skepticism time time again, things get pulled market due long-term safety concerns due rushed approval probably fastest drug make market.  Hello, rethink truth then. Uh, no. even close.

Your normal everyday people going getting vaccine around middle next year. many reasons take long time yet Kids learn virtually Watch Emma Thompson making announcements TV.

Basically, ""article"" something similar university's student newspaper reliable. think people get vaccinated see black friday shopping safely masks. Remember vaccines reached 90%+ efficacy conditions people given also adhering masks distancing. almost testing vaccines normal conditions. possibly likely without masks social distancing vaccines 60-70% effective.   ghost typing dying covid? Oh we'll sadly plenty refuse take various crackpot reasons. I'm guessing read headline got triggered?

We already know means. Always been. Please delete horrible comment Yeah think said ramped production year due covid. many places multiple re-orders year. also saw lot ""drive up"" flu clinics year ever making much accessible great! "" Chinese officials would embrace falsehoods facts side point strength endurance beyond me. ""

when media labels everything China ""seemingly effective"" ""draconian"" ""totalitarian"" ""suppression freedom violation human rights""( already ignoring social media various tabloids ""eyecatching"" content), would longer ""strength endurance"" public perception everything incompatible supposed ""freedom democracy"".

By invalidating everything ideological perspective, would LESSONS LEARNED dispite what's reported, occational article NYT something gonna change public perception, people's minds set immune reality. mean 3 month trial vs 5 year trial. know consider cutting safety step. safety data 3-4 months drugs undergo 3-5 year sometimes even longer safety assessment (and many drugs black boxed/pulled market due long term safety studies). Hell, projects worked on, FDA looking 6 month canine study (\~1mil) new type drug assess safety, despite us running pre-IND safety studies mice/rats/cells, able file IND. new vector/drug this. 3 months development mice straight humans. Sure proper steps taken proper steps dictated FDA says proper steps are. Hell started Warp speed (20 years ago) get drugs approved faster, amount drugs pulled market increased effect steps changed. Almost education important. People West Virginia live little bubble anything keep walls up. matter dangerous counterproductive families. understanding vaccine correctly, people minimize symptoms rather completely prevent covid. mind, would true still get ‚Äúlong covid‚Äù vaccinated? There's explanation took article includes link posted. trying insinuate anything, Interesting read. zero medical background, feel like reasonable guess anyone requires ventilator probably counted die without one. I'm sure many others require hospitalization intubation also survive. didn‚Äôt say said repeating talking point. done? buddy Department Health said Sunday increased order vaccine developed U.S. firm Moderna 5 million 7 million doses, enough 3.5 million people.

Some vaccines require 2 shots. know shape right now. already told school system blatant disregard state mandated safety measures something happens son hearing me.  Yet happens you‚Äôd think Clickbait title wrong. 

Actual reason retraction explained original publisher:

""Briand‚Äôs study used exclusively understanding impact COVID-19, taken context countless data published Hopkins, World Health Organization Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC).
As assistant director Master‚Äôs Applied Economics program Hopkins, Briand neither medical professional disease researcher. talk, stated research data needed understand effects COVID-19 U.S.""

Source: talked lot kids knew school grew up. us still touch them. think talked lot COVID-19. think able close physical distances have. 

It like them. great. 

Like get play Monopoly hearts... probably would made popcorn though. aka nice place walk? Johns Hopkins conducting COVID vaccine trials months. Canadian well know I‚Äôll take soon let me. 

But half coworkers saying don‚Äôt want get vaccine don‚Äôt trust it! work hospital! (Not doctor nurse) Really makes worried older generation reason don‚Äôt trust modern medicine? might well make entire post caps lock. pretty much. üéµ'cause United gave SARSüéµ ‚ÄúDie Hard‚Äù Bruce Willis ‚Äú12 Monkeys‚Äù Bruce Willis? Youre saying it‚Äôs ok work within feet someone covid don‚Äôt tell you? Nothing stop temporarily finding new job serving opens back up, right?

Not saying doesn‚Äôt suck, certain point people get different jobs unavailable.  think many people care. It‚Äôs fair ignore everyone give Thanksgiving. Maybe deaths, recorded Corona. Yay reasonable internet discussion threads! :) since they're tired whole thing. Even though doctors nurses can't talk sense anyone shit. believe shit tons conspiracy theories almost want tell ""wouldn't make sense Russians chinese behind undermine health people here?"". Seriously....if gonna believe theory one makes sense say want see sparks fly contort trying retort it.... Gradually, suddenly. ""Learn mistake"" said many people since whole thing started, family take stories heart. fuck all, got deserved. Surge Upon Surge

shit serious

Surge 2nd power. talking person reduce spread traveled. Basically isolate, wear masks, etc. Running trials Canada would allow local regulators conduct safety assessments.

Canada facilities manufacture Sinovac Vaccine. facilities manufacture Modern Pfizer vaccines.

Basically private non-state-owned (as private companies China) company wanted run trials Canada someone Chinese government nixed business plan halting exports work out. 

Lots people unreasonably angry IMO. article Corona Lombardy last december

So start seeing loads deaths March? happens throw towel. reason lockdowns restrictions. happens, death rate goes way way way up. ""Flight 180"" I‚Äôm confused, vaccine approved? thought FDA still review ? Bolding random words makes argument less effective, effective. concern people want hear good news failing face possibility mutations fading immunity whatever reasons.... herd immunity may unlikely impossible near term aka years. 

It seems prudence demands people every adjust adapt prosper thrive even immunity COVID possible. reality may well immunity vaccination prior infection lasts one month six months 90%+ population. 

In addition, mutations virus may already increasing mortality rates among people 30 years age. Meaning segment global population least likely use preventative measures becoming segment highest mortality rate. 

The simple fact don‚Äôt yet know. don‚Äôt know long vaccines offer protection COVID. don‚Äôt know mutations virus infecting population groups. don‚Äôt even know many illnesses, often fatal, really caused COVID simply never diagnosed such. 

Simple questions must answered. anyone virus immune getting again? so, long? vaccine, effective preventing infection general population IE millions people? long? 

What variances year year death rates exist? those, could due COVID? nonfatal year year illnesses. 

Are people get COVID likely severe even fatal case? mortality rate increase tenfold subsequent infection? true three infections less 10% infected population survives?

It matters. saying. worst case scenario could vastly worse people realizing. Well do? cant make car payment lockdowns fear illness caused lose job. 

How gonna pay ur car? 

Repo man Licensed car thief. Hey, I'm American, I'm honestly happy domestic product. 100% side medicine, science whole life, way whole pandemic politicized incredibly concerned taking vaccine domestically produced... Pretty shitty say, truth. vaccines coming. know better treat it. enough space staff hospitals, it‚Äôs going continue suck. need patient little longer, people cannot that. old lady working supermarket register past nine months probably get last, ain‚Äôt America.

Airliners don‚Äôt fly quite high even 37,000-41,000 easily see -60 -65 so. warmth comes compressed air engines (also pressurization). Non-climate controlled storage gets REALLY cold altitude. Even fuel wings either heated additive added prevents fuel freezing.

Fauci expects immunity year know duration thus far immunity, would surprised turns 20-year duration, would also surprised less year,‚Äù continued. ‚ÄúI think would probably Derek results we‚Äôre seeing two vaccines reported interim data far, think prospects lasting immunity vaccination also good. Remember, early vaccine data suggested antibody responses least strong found naturally infected cases. seems (so far) every reason think vaccine-based immunity good better conferred actual coronavirus actually Brazil exploding cases india. kitchen next 8 hours day. Wrong! Eye doctor Rand Paul schooled Fauci summer herd immunity. Paul showed NYC reached herd immunity, uptick cases recently! /s swimming regularly March lock down.

I'm looking exercise machines workout home. swimming, watch stuff use Zombies, Run! bike, treadmill, rowing machine. Serious question trying piss people all: point throw towel try adapt live it? California lockdowns intermittently entirety pandemic hasn‚Äôt really helped. almost feels like we‚Äôre delaying inevitable sticking around forever. really unfortunate substantial number people dont care covid unless get infected. completely normal. cant ship DC end customer yet Dude much this. covid weeks ago couldn‚Äôt sleep bc thought gave immunocompromised mom. waited 4 days negative test result celebrated by..going gym...  renters aren‚Äôt paying rent property managers supposed pay mortgage? banks allowed foreclose properties currently? 200000 cases per day leggo Sounds awful lot like technocracy Goggles glasses Somehow Sunday Thanksgiving seems bit late headline like this. Florida next! odds US major airliner accident bad enough destroy plane vaccine close zero essentially zero. Even including cargo (and FedEx accident BHM years ago Atlas Air one recently) it‚Äôs still less 1 per year of, what, millions flights? seriously bad luck. Dr Li Wenliang might thought differently overestimate well schools ran NYC. may Florida South Dakota public schools terrible supervision even worse sanitary measures unfortunately. Officials say locate missing luggage. Boris Johnson: that's much; let's lift measures! officials getting first doses

Pfffffft.

In seriousness, need show they're taking prove indeed vaccine restore confidence. get approved? flying fuck literally news? enough fear get clicks? someone smarter explain much dry ice allowed plane? Every issue must exploited gain. Also sides valid. sides valid others. reason think doesn‚Äôt. know 7-10 days. probably back normal quite quickly. hopefully summer. Canadian Texas tendency unintelligent.  Vaccines certain level quality around 300 years. Chinese vaccine uses technology. hard. Yeah, many wearing formality cos airline requirements?

The smart safe thing keep mask times even eat drink flight. Muslims manage 12 hours fast, can't you? Unless, course, underlying medical condition.

But many Americans know take mask seriously? many seen pull noses? period meal times eat. might even use excuse keep mask perpetually snacking.

So no, regard saving grace. Planes act super spreaders unless willing impose draconian measures in-flight. seen willing beyond masks. kind thing gets concerned.

There many people take vaccine, included, know long-term effects yet may take years manifest. really going restrict people's freedoms they're wary yet-unknown long-term effects vaccine took less year develop? people need kept together enclosed area next three weeks. ridiculous. Nowhere US single day lockdowns. half-assed ""shutdowns"" things closed, nothing even approaching actual shutdowns countries illegal even leave house without valid reason.

And states like Texas Florida even half asked shutdowns well. Americans car culture instead public transportation culture. ITT: people shitting opening schools don‚Äôt children Getting covid funeral like getting referral funeral home. whatever room time him, especially avoid prolonged indoor conversations. look Surfaces big risk initially believed, common area still wash hands touching nose mouth.

This settled issue. amount pleading change this. get us insane drug laws either. one lunatic ""expert"" called Nils Bejerot lobbying government.

So drug policy surprisingly similar world over? Bejerot lobby every government world? maybe kind of, dare say it, *consensus*. school rhetoric gets nowhere. shows yet another Swede can't debate.

You mean like silly stereotypical oversimplification Swedish culture? Thanks review. 1/10. Yeah, think they'd need particularly high security. There's always risk lone nutter gun something stupid, think there's much chance anything organised. People might want steal security super low, think hard time reselling kind scale without getting caught. would happen argument virtual school...? parents still work, work home absurd ever schools closed bars open.

But, we're honest, teachers unions LOT that. looking themselves. Ever heard autocorrect? Thanks notifying me! appreciate it. I‚Äôm sorry confusing, specifically referring children. kids general facing disastrous gaps core understanding. It‚Äôs true everyone millions kids ok (I‚Äôm sure even rare ones better home). Parenting, self-discipline, teacher familiarity technology, etc play part. large, what‚Äôs happening students quite bad. said anything wearing 2022? That's fine- successful schools do. one said let kids run wild. Mask up. understand literally can't leave country right? even could like countries hand citizenship anyone wants. side effects? curious cause 4 month old wanna 100% confident take it. sub crazy hivemind. friend interned Wilmington chose live Philly commute got hired full time boring Wilmington was. fools. I've depressed day made laugh loud. Thank good laugh. mean... feel like we're probably heading way form tbh. So, nothing all?

I live Washington - one better states - people place.

It's infuriating. pretty big scandal Sweden, situation quite similar - pandemic leading vaccines rushed potentially unknown side effects.

Note think pros outweighs cons would probably take vaccine given opportunity, think concerns valid. vast majority Swedes trusting vaccines vary vaccines general, new rushed vaccines.

The antivax movement relatively small Sweden distrust child vaccination, tick vaccine, flu shots etc. difference vaccines around long time known safe. Schools remain closed functioning Department Education create science-based national strategy. 2 months away schools least 2 weeks time would winter vacation anyway. Wisconsin left chat. 

Seriously state closed bars left schools open people would find way start bars schools. already bars grocery stores. always weird countries manage make stuff work somehow US we're told impossible. NYC elementary school working well. teachers staff made sure kids follow restrictions, eat desks, run halls. least elementary schools worked well NYC. Oh hey, I've seen before! 
And right large inevitable spread Thanksgiving. could go wrong? Anyone knows knows deal death well. went grandfather's wake, stayed foyer/waiting area. friend's dad's funeral. capacity could there.

Truly peak r/LateStageCapitalism. May Jazz Pharam roast Hell! Couldn‚Äôt agree more... American contend pathologically self-interested teacher‚Äôs unions claim teachers essential workers suits them. 

But frankly, saying Fauci ‚Äúurge Biden‚Äù reminds us dysfunctional America‚Äôs federal system kind crisis. doubt Biden authority. Shouldn‚Äôt Fauci be, fact, urging fifty state governors? even then, it‚Äôs likely school district decide itself.   Personally, I‚Äôm excited idea restrictions 2022, I‚Äôm bracing possibility. Generally speaking, one reasons I‚Äôve able get lockdowns restrictions without much ‚Äúlockdown fatigue‚Äù assumed long haul. remember family members back May saying ‚Äúthis would allll over‚Äù September, idea seemed appealing, seem realistic me. hanging onto idea would months beginning, would 1000% totally bouncing walls right now. So, guess, protect future me, would rather assume form restrictions years pleasantly surprised things go well, put emotional energy assuming things better spring feel crushed fatigued things last longer. 

But *also* I‚Äôm going piss anyone‚Äôs parade want excited idea spring big turnaround. Lol copy pasta hysterical like plan Jesus. people copy paste shit every thread? I‚Äôve read couple variations soapbox rant none anything original coherent say.  insane think could stomp covid completely like NZ. simply possible, comment screams anti american reddit bullshit know disregard anyways. Almost western countries one parent staying home permanently child. 100% agree. teachers hospital staff highest risk categories, think ""essential personnel"" next. Due volume customers interact daily basis, many refuse wear mask, next line. 

I happy last line vaccine many others need deserve do. intentionally said first wave. Please check first wave. second part comment highlights awareness numbers currently show higher mortality France. ‚Äúi called doctors gave standard advice let ask reddit make others feel worse‚Äù

Didn‚Äôt think would negative affect healthcare, supplies, personnel, PPE though. every right rage potential F‚Äôing data make seem less bad really is.

I‚Äôm former guy local Health Dept, required separate phone line fax part phone solution rest County maintained. hitting 9 get line out, example.  Driving around Black Friday never would known pandemic going on. Mall parking lots completely filled. people families can‚Äôt online needed focus. Domestic violence / internet /other problems etc Silly question, vaccine distributed amongst Americans first? agree could either both. Actually, true. France's deaths per 1000 population 75, Sweden's 65: 7 year old child struggled year. already homeschooled lot social interaction homeschooling play groups Girl Scouts. Without either those, besides Zoom meetings, alnost zero interaction kids. worries us.  Seriously. year taught us many people view teachers glorified babysitters. many 100s headlines seen school opening closing due outbreaks? Running clinical trials grunt work. Look AZ fucked I‚Äôve also noticed surge comments aptly pointing Agreed. could incompetence equally deserving fired. even approved likely wont see available summer. Yes course be. whole 8 months cautious lost power intimidate. people want grown beyond fear might happen. want kids back school. want go movies, want go bars. want holiday gatherings. reminds pictures kids walking combat zones get school. resignation sets finally go ""If I'm going die, might well live then"". course careless people family member die yet. still careful, because, us ""maybe"" ""eventually"". ""Meanwhile, number kids fussy defiant never fell 70‚ÄØpercent. ‚ÄúOur 6-month-old cries entire day. The¬†entire¬†day,‚Äù wrote one late-30s mother Ohio middle August.""

Isn't typical kid behavior? (Baby Colic maybe?) dad thing early January. didn‚Äôt go hospital took steroids two three different types anabiotic‚Äôs get straight. still seen data? released yet.

Yeah, no, we‚Äôre sense. union? negotiated agreement district would follow reopening recommendations state board education, much control there. 

I would much rather classroom. it‚Äôs safe, uncontrolled spread, parents send sick kids school, people aren‚Äôt willing change social behaviors safe. schools going make spread worse, although may take month. So, virtual teaching is, students children (who opted virtual).  really. Fauci many health experts said around June, that‚Äôs say won‚Äôt restrictions things like concerts. stunningly ignorant comment vaccines 95% effective even proven stop contracting it. suggested might lessen serious case. also still infect others vaccines. enraging mom right now. kids private school pay regardless go not. public school took poor planning place. I‚Äôm already salty pay kids go safe school, free. I‚Äôm keep home weeks time quarantine kids, one teachers, exposed covid. I‚Äôm freaking tired kids missing education teacher needed attend bodybuilding competition caught covid. put kids first? haven‚Äôt gone anywhere school work since March. one trying yet still punished, really getting old. also remember start media telling us people China ""collapsing"" street covid. come never happened since country?

They're afraid they'll required get vaccine order come back. agree I'm signing they're available. realized going next big debate. Certain roles probably require vaccination. states allow people opt out. Outbreaks may become localized based state law. going get crazy. 

We answer, convince people, especially may vectors disease based many people interact with, use it. May wild cutting close    Lack state level leadership, lack federal leadership lack personal responsibility seem like top three whatever order like People lived isolation long time America 1900. again, easily.

Nope, we're switching full remote week. We're back person, we've changed hybrid model 1/3 class person per day. Things changed we're going bring students back. 

We time make curriculum engaging fucking exhausted constant changing, tripling workload zero extra pay, mountains shit piled us community members, parents, admin, heavily criticized engaging, checking often enough students, collecting paycheck ""parents actual work."" 

We're done. We're tapped out. Oh I'm totally aware much Jazz Pharma rat fucking fellow narcoleptics lol

I wanted tell everyone else. screamed rooftops severely punished ratfuckery, live country rewarded, unfortunately. :-(  think they'll ""essential worker"" block get pretty soon healthcare workers nursing home residents. I'm sorry, living version country *everything* else completely normal masks ""inconvenience""? one masks perfect solution completely eradicate virus? Looks like we're another narrative shift apparently covid done again. means whole lot people probably die next months.

It's going absolutely blow peoples minds vaccines end covid. Anyhoo, think need acknowledge bus driven cliff point. forces far larger anyone ensuring going edge matter what.

GL, get sick. injured. old. obese. unlucky. Yeah see oncologist week I‚Äôll check then. Oh fuck China already.

In Reno Vegas, lab results reported within 2-3 days tests taken. Vegas, major testing sites closed holiday (Thursday Friday) didn‚Äôt re-open Saturday. Using example: you‚Äôre looking maximum 3-day turnaround, test completed Wednesday result Saturday. number tallied Sunday‚Äôs reporting.

We 1,200 positive cases reported today (*technically yesterday‚Äôs numbers*). huge decline previous day‚Äôs reporting. expect Monday‚Äôs numbers similar due many tests occurring. either Tuesday Wednesday, massive spike occur. I'm saying they're lying, to, course would blame India. LOL would want go around bragging country made fucking vaccine. nothing personal accomplishments, could give shit less. could called germany vaccine made United States company. I'd go stay outside minimum 6ft away everyone. give hugs later ""safe"" again. want husband end main attraction next funeral.

I'm sorry loss. hope able find peace passing. Stay strong. Good. It‚Äôs stupid policy ban outdoor dining. Instead city hire people enforce outdoor dining. tent one exit outdoor dining. assumably reassure children Santa gonna come infect whole household get sick Christmas.

Snap? one gone still looks like extra tendon neck, don‚Äôt feel it. definitely think it‚Äôs sensation worth revision. It‚Äôs also important remember cutting away scarred tubing causes new scarring. Nothing like tugging feeling though. 

I definitely would hold ... anxiety roof little things might shunt related whole pandemic. family team ‚Äújust stay home you‚Äôll fine‚Äù ... don‚Äôt know planet live anymore. something happens hospitals can‚Äôt treat people like us they‚Äôre overflowing ... guess going happen anyway, eventually?

Explain high compliance areas like LA SF stringent restrictions protocol cases skyrocketing...  Victoria played role fucking intake closed international airport arrivals, moving job states both.

I totally blame people ignorant reckless; one *preventing* mask wearing one *forcing* people congregate crowded areas. Even government absolutely nothing pandemic, things would still better people exercised level personal social responsibility. yeah, I'm letting hook either. work, one wears masks. They're prevented it, feel like it. covid washes place business, there's good chance get sick them. sort pisses off. I'm particularly smart disciplined; something easy wearing mask pandemic order keep *other people* getting infected me, totally blame extending courtesy. 

That absolve government blame. Yes, peoples' duty remain informed matters, also job government leaders actually *lead*. mean, that's plain part jobs. Even financial relief ever possible, still job *leaders* send message pandemic big deal people least bare minimum keep fellow citizens safe. 

What saying seems like plain old victim blaming. like scam person way, yeah...they seen scam. mean I'm piece crap scamming them. people hopefully smart enough let shitty leaders lead cliff mean shitty leaders blame telling people jump. family 30+ family member gathering... started 2 days Thanksgiving ended yesterday. Everyone getting drunk, eating together, mask.

And they're pissed joining them.... Can't wait find caught COVID19. like 4th July 5 ppl family caught 20+ person gathering. people willingly lived way past several months, Fauci might've better news us Christmas.  got mine couple months ago! really important go. afraid things precautions took made feel extremely safe. Ask dentist/doctor something help anxiety! diagnosed COVID. title say was.

It even says article. misleading stuff belong Don‚Äôt forget two witless Senators. Yeah type thinking also could collapse. lot doctors stressed rise cases. puts huge deal stress everything. People say hoax, mortality rate low. Thing virus takes away areas healthcare. stresses healthcare. gonna take two weeks us really see happens time itll Christmas, could even bigger surge. Vaccine needs distributed health care helps helping stress healthcare workers.  herd immunity killing population make go away? say this? even read article yourself? tested. correct. apologize available non-Canadians downvoted r/coronavirus cult. worry, question perfectly valid

I'm teacher we're full remote learning am. Timetables organized goal. exceptions may asked one rule France full remoting now. Happy cake day! kid, every time got fever, would get auditory visual hallucinations. Terrifying stuff. Hope back normal Can‚Äôt already caught still carry spread it? Fake-mews cat may bag lying there. 

I'm pretty safe overseas really feel all. Based Tegnell's comments tracing. Testing high, stated tracing important. one long-covid cult accept it, people probably suffering mild forms PTSD anxiety. I'll get downvoted hell told ""how dare you"" science there.

""Throughout March, Bowen, 49, Caerphilly, says felt ‚Äúchesty fluey‚Äù cough progressive, disabling fatigue. ‚ÄúI walking shop one day wanted lie pavement go sleep,‚Äù says. cough persisted. One evening late March, Bowen unwell called 111. sent A&amp;E, x-rays showed lungs ‚Äúwere good shape‚Äù, ""

So guy breath exhausted could barely walk yet x-ray picked nothing lungs 'good shape'.

I've said illl say again. two possibilities - anxiety real thing either never existed completely disappeared last year, or...some people anxiety. I've years, EXACT symptoms people describe, long COVID.

I'm saying people genuine complications COVID - course do. I'm saying people point blank refusing accept unending fear anxiety caused whole terrible ordeal may psychological effects.

2019: 2,855,000
2020: 11/14 total deaths= 2,512,880 California better states per capita despite dense, populated cities nation. What, said rhat said poor handling refugee crisis merely due countries? ever say say Swedes out. said many photo, extension less faith Swedes numeric whole obey government's advice, apparently lot news here. change fact people continue respect government recommendations. clearly enough, Oh, also back live Sweden first wave, way many Swedes streets/shops/bars, I'm kinda agree were. Still, people stayed home (and now), original statement disagreed with.

You believe mask use gone either, judging picture, yet has. sure US, happened Belgium, Italy India (might still happening places). happened thereafter either start triaging based likely survive (i.e. gets treatment thence gets live) start sending patients countries (Belgium overflow started happening). Please do! someone went chemo May-Sept would beyond upset nurses behaved way. BKA something like US something like US Homeland Fuck that‚Äôs morbid say need public health approach? Requiring people wear masks quarantine *is* ""public health approach,"" requires individual accountability order work, like public safety measure does. Luckily vaccine arrived Belgium Yeah soon pull truck would get jacked 59th. North side safer.  Union leadership come said PPE required 100% time working get fired wearing they‚Äôre going anything help you. result: nobody messes around. It‚Äôs amazing happens there‚Äôs little bit leadership united strategy. kind stranger.. 

Happy cake day, mate! everyone thinks travel ONE location done harm society much, especially compared ""those people"" wear masks something superspreaders. ofc wont, every expert listen says first step need cautios.

but reddit pandemic over!!!!!!!!! normal ~~ summer ~~ ~~ spring ~~ new year!!!!!! Dude focus ranked choice voting. get rest follow. feel way! Maybe raised expectations people bit, might rise meet them. selfish reckless early 20s late 20s, nothing prevents young people responsible right thing. people even work, literally nothing worry except school, yet still insisting partying, least necessary past time imaginable. guess see value saying ""well, people suck that's way surprised"" instead actually holding people accountable selfish, shitty actions. shithole country age internet misinformation absolutely fucked us hasn‚Äôt :(. mean unbelievable anti-vax movement seemingly gotten big Religion stay politics. objectively bad property owner able pay mortgage ownership building changes versus evicting someone onto street pandemic. can't tell people can't work give real financial aid.

Very true. like I've said before, sociopaths country give fuck people all. one many reasons I'm moving another country.

That said, House passed new Covid relief bill back May sitting Senate waiting vote since then.  daft. saw article earlier instantly archive it. important! see Pfiezer price bad. ¬£15/ vaccine x 2. vaccine developed quickly auditable cold chain required, 90% effective. least, seems better value money ¬£522m eat help scheme. Depends mask mandates (she likely broke Oregon's, penalty minor).

But could definitely lose license, state boards clauses things like professional conduct moral character. Interestingly example seems prove rational need public health approach (which person saying) rather individual accountability approach (which saying). that's stupid moral, thinking like standard medical biller going bill:

* cost setting tent.
* Standard fee privilege treated **period** extra supposedly ""Better"" treatment terms speed.
* Higher cost kerosene heaters electric heaters since winter.
* demand ventilators alone price hike.
* may overworking staff effectively reason greed still charge extra work subpar conditions.

I honestly doubt 2x higher fees come December. wanna know what's *fantastic?* Nobody government gives shit many end homeless due cost flat die result choosing seek care ""That's free market!"" **How get here?**

The journalists/editors/whoever writing headlines ashamed themselves. mean, I'm aunt hate vodka, yet  doesn‚Äôt sound good Except takes fair bit specialised training anaesthetise intubate somebody, particularly people sick covid pts need typically long wait around die hypoxia. regularly spend time close contact Covid patients, go treat vulnerable patients suffering comorbidities? save lives living? Could getting sick Covid mean transmit disease lots vulnerable people, and/or prevent delivering urgently needed healthcare sickest vulnerable society?

If answer questions ""No"" life, vaccine terms, valuable doctor's.

(And FWIW I'm sure life far valuable mine, terms vaccine priority - let's pretend vaccinating doctor kind upper-class privilege.) clearly vulcan then. :( I'm saying higher ups known low 20 somethings going strict needed. understand pandemic, like understand motorcycles dangerous. People 20s stupid things sometimes. They're young, paid college, want experience, humans naturally self centered. know get covid personally fine, probably simply care. multi factorial thing without one right answer. can't let 20 year olds put position party expect happen. again, saying right, that's Literally article it. realize home quarantine already place? Aussies also told quarantine self-isolate also. Morrison media PR stunt photographer him. Australians premiers still warped view dealing Covid rules apply 'me' 'them'. 

On note, trust hotel quarantine either, seeing transmissions community staff, including Adelaide medi hotel cases found genomic testing, actually locally transmitted case. 

When someone put forward ""what happens pop Woolies"" (you get online delivery) ""what happens friends want visit"" (you close door tell friends dumb wanting visit first place) two things easy do, addition others.

(I also mention exclusively home quarantine, mixture both. Home quarantine/home self isolation already happening medical exceptions, Australia also completely failing part granting exceptions people need it). managed find trillions rich people tax cuts pandemic aid they're gonna let everyone else get boned? I'm going accept that. ***YOU CAN'T GIVE WOKE MORNING DECIDED NOTHING SINCE FUCKING MARCH!***

I state *where* blame lies, critical thinking skills clear never *tried* take seriously all. basing on? They‚Äôve saying it. Repeatedly.  many stupids listening refusing listen. 

It‚Äôs infuriating. NYC Mayor De Blasio Exactly! driving fucking crazy. people fighting thanksgiving travel mom goes work 6 days week gets exposed hundreds strangers. aren‚Äôt healthcare workers Covid deniers. people homeless two paychecks lost. healthcare, I‚Äôd literally quit.

Can medical professionals requisitioned USA? mean them, committed authority work medical place?

It possible countries. idea USA. ironic start offering immigration incentives Mexican nurses doctors. fun part working delivery whether fellow coworkers, boss, customers sucked most. random kids Halloween run front car start Fortnite Floss prank Halloween flipping bird, customers chew *for pizza box* bent, coworker would chew late getting back location piss breaks rush hour traffic expected get 5 minute delivery back 10 minutes 30 given massive town cars 30 year old manager who, usually nice, barely enforced COVID precautions even *she shift.* 

It got especially fun got paid less minimum wage state tips could go hours receiving tip meant effectively spend paycheck paying *a* dental bill gas. That's top jipping overtime anyways.

Honest god everyone forced work form customer service get sick less year, quickly realize shit sucks. imagine like doctor right effectively tasked helping chose hurt others *and* abused family ""Doing job"" good enough. Wild aunt teaches highschool school 3k kids... less 200 cases total since begging year. Imagine film dramatization Fauci‚Äôs experience COVID pandemic Wow would really suck Nooooooooooo hate one measure 100% effective mean useless.

FWIW, *no* measure 100% effective, even vaccines.

But combined, several measures well 50% effective highly effective. fact, even measures 20% effective, they're generally worth doing.

If people behaved way, pandemic would virtually non-existent. Imagine taking roller coaster ride Six Flags night person park. know Rudy gotten it. It‚Äôs covid take account, it‚Äôs human behaviour mental health. 

They really close schools, course you‚Äôre right. Children vectors sending get infected. Ah yes, entire region conspired make Europe U.S. look bad! I'm Thailand, way, think know situation around here. please stop acting like people *20s* children can't ""understand"" pandemic follow basic public safety guidelines? absolutely responsible selfish actions huge reason spikes many cities. live rural college town, fine students came back started partying nonstop though everything normal. fact, partied even *more* usual classes online one wake early next day. return students utter refusal stop partying months followed made small town number one entire nation covid increases literally send national guard help testing. ""young"" excuse, plenty young, student employees (most 22 younger) selfish assholes entire situation. I'm tired seeing many people acting like ""expected"" young people stupid therefore held accountable actions. young person get painfully sick lingering problems. Even they're small, depressing existentially minor health problem never know finally get better.

We actually know rates kind thing, though baselessly claim super rare.

Don't mess COVID. There's reason. part vaccines close. Yeah, 9 mobile morgues El Paso needed FEMA imaginary guess. Congratulations new baby. one year x Pretty much describes past four years evidence based policy largely abandoned. Generally. I've met pretty dumb nurses lifetime. I'm sure they're minority though.

ICU nurses usually hardcore believers reality COVID see firsthand. number test worldometer parsed manually China NHS public announcement. haven‚Äôt mentioned since August, even mentioned twice. Technically include site, number tests reported twice cause honestly, pooled testing China like doing, would even report it‚Äôs apple apple comparison rest world? country capable mass pooled testing millions couple days. count them? count pool? could breaking health protocols hospital she‚Äôs taking seriously, could get de-registered ? Also get KN94 masks. give reassurance protecting others aren‚Äôt wearing masks. Oh Trump does? don‚Äôt really restrictions United States. magnesium super easy come balanced healthy diet.

Not really. you‚Äôre deficient, absolutely supplementing things like magnesium except extreme cases.

Like taking high doses vitamin D... live rural town haven‚Äôt hit super hard hard enough people take seriously (spoiler: don‚Äôt). Anyway, personally know several nurses flat care safety protocol outside work. Still gatherings, still wearing masks, etc. like month one town‚Äôs doctors years experience died Covid. Since it‚Äôs small town, worked Doctor regularly still don‚Äôt care. bunch nurses tested positive instead worrying leaving rest staff dry take care Covid patients limited staff, boast 2 week paid vacation. It‚Äôs sad, man. Vast majority nurses see social media, tv, news articles stress importance Covid safety reason town, majority don‚Äôt seem care. don‚Äôt get anymore Humans pretty dumb especially comes things like exponential factor. need nurses quality suffers push everyone school. 4 people get caught cheating test, got kicked program, nope... mentioned hopeful German government provide financial help, confident completely cover costs.


How much cost fill restaurant large stuffed pandas? story Spring Breakers made up. major news sources covered there's thousands references online prove happened, really happen. Vietnam taiwan way less covid, u.s. Russia way testing. I‚Äôm really sure you‚Äôre trying say though ‚Äúlow rates‚Äù still talking testing? vaccine always cards this. nurse needs reporting state board too. Getting C19 inevitable.  trust people every incentive lie ig. Bad world makes sick, hope thing mutates get wiped face earth collectively. Fuck this.

That escalated pretty quickly. last dumb question - theory create cool vaccines days weeks, manufacture cheap quick, making influenza vaccines target likely candidates rather 3-4? TikTok great. real problem reddit. ""We're better rest world,"" Mr Trump told Ms Bartiromo, speaking way coronavirus handled United States

How say that? lie like that? I'd like see source this. think 90% figure anything vital load, rather immune system's ability adapt. never said easy. said lives teachers faculty staff need priority. Northern Italy Thank much, likewise! Know even though don‚Äôt realize it, people care. May others come realize hard times. affects negatively how? immunity works 85% population immune

No, herd immunity threshold depends contagious disease is. influenza around 40% measles something like 95% looked kitchen quickly, got 100% first two things eat day stopped looking. 2 teaspoons Chia Seeds 2 slices wheat bread got hump.

If look [Cleavland list, shows depths magnisum foods.

The American Standard Diet true enemy public health, except rare cases supplements really needed. D3 list hard come naturally 6 months year most. u really hate ""everyone anyways"" bs. heard times training sure. students abusive households, ones starving family can‚Äôt afford food, ones homeless, ones falling behind, ones don‚Äôt learn well online (hence they‚Äôve going person school whole life instead home school), ones can‚Äôt get help parents live household parents work, ones watch *multiple* kids Zoom classes... definitely survive year issues. It‚Äôs little regression widened education gap! could go wrong long term?

/s  :( Take Vitamin d. federal government intern Japanese-American citizens, arrange closed state borders national emergency. (Yes, prominent, respected, judges today would argue internments legal.)

This moot anyway Trump obviously interest anything, Biden -- even wanted -- balls try it. something know - no, DNA altering.

mRNA something body uses take information (basically recipes) DNA build proteins body, make new cells. DNA kinda like big recipe book, mRNA copy single recipe. mRNA interacts ribosomes build instructions new protein. Everything body built way.

mRNA vaccines cool instead putting dead virus body (dumb, old, blunt way vaccination), put mRNA instructions build harmless unique bit virus. mRNA builds bit virus job done degrades gone. body sees new unusual thing learns attack like entire virus, remembers ""this thing bad, kill sight!"" that's vaccinated immune.

Technologies like CRISPR try change DNA, can't change enough DNA make permanent. Imagine body giant library full trillions DNA recipe books - go change single recipe thousand books going huge effect, changed enough right place, maybe would enough fix one issue (eg. targeting bad genes liver might enough fix Hunters Syndrome example).

To change DNA permanently either very, early embryo stage make enough changes ""standard"" DNA gets copied again, make massive changes right safe - process 100% - want random shit changing, know happen.

The weird exciting alternative DNA recipe book, mRNA single recipe, could intercept inject new mRNA ""good"" instead trying change massive amount DNA? mRNA degrades time could good testing temporary fixes work towards deciding make changes DNA. US could spent $5T last decade fighting climate change US military budget reduced normal level $200B. would put country much stronger strategic position, reliant foreign oil, saving trillions war Iraq Afghanistan. 

My nationality irrelevant facts, ad hominem betrays lack argument. going suck. wonder people ever seen kids act, hygienically. I'm talking elementary schools. NZ here. 6 weeks lockdown. life pretty much back normal. Republicans want bring back feudalism. Throw people apartments houses 10 rich assholes buy properties pennies. Suddenly boss want pay money anymore, work housing. (But house always decides work hours now). guess least they're protesting safe manner. picking fight? sounds like agree vaccine needs happen kids sent back‚Äîat least large cities.

I‚Äôm teacher I‚Äôm well aware situation care kids resent assumption don‚Äôt. kids put back burner. busting ass every day creating lessons, making videos, teaching zoom make happen‚Äîunpaid much sacrifice personal life way. 

There seems assumption teachers don‚Äôt care kids aren‚Äôt learning anything. That‚Äôs true‚Äîwe care many kids learning. projects many kids turning year best I‚Äôve seen far. Indo Fs year don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs function understanding material reflection effort parental involvement. 

The kids failing class simply aren‚Äôt turning anything in, plagiarizing, parents don‚Äôt make much effort get back us little motivate them. Education teachers. It‚Äôs team effort parents, staff, kids, community. students primary thought every day risk lives, family‚Äôs lives, family‚Äôs life perpetuating hasty decisions reopening without making sure truly best interest.

I said would ‚Äúconsider‚Äù reopening fall way knowing situation look like come summer. mutation occurs virus becomes deadly? 

I agree plan reopening contingency fall, However, think also need focus make distance learning social meantime. lot boards putting effort that. Instead, seem trying get kids back spring cases sky high fighting unions. That‚Äôs wasting energy. working teachers see feel realistic help kids digitally rather expending energy trying prevent hasty spring return.

Unfortunately, parents often simplistic view teaching may mean pandemic. big chunk staff willing work understanding means. means new teachers best double triple class sizes worst. also need understand possible even go back hybrid format. guarantee nowhere near same. assumption simply returning mean quality education social needs improve false. guarantee hybrid format difficult teachers therefore result worse education.

Regarding depression anxiety agree huge issue. It‚Äôs happening across lot countries lot age groups life like was. People dying, stressed out, economies bad shape, people lost jobs, politics divisive ever recent history...and kids seeing that‚Äîreturning school fix that. Kids sudden depressed return school. return early teachers leave, get sick, die‚Äîhow might depression fare then? family member dies result reopening? happens there‚Äôs outbreak school shut anyway? would disrupt routines already built place. Kids need structure go back halfway spring hybrid vaccines yet available get even stressed now.

So bottom line, understand teachers coming say uneasy returning vaccines distributed. really best intentions kids heart. ‚ÄúDow 30k. Congratulations everyone‚Äù

Our fucking President days ago. understand ""survey""... terminology thing? call random people ask COVID? Sad true. Humans pure filth greed. Zero respect. trash. Prison, please Well, I‚Äôm 52 high blood pressure. One fellow guinea pigs 75, high cholesterol, high blood pressure diabetic. Another, 62 year old woman would considered obese. spot on, we‚Äôre young healthy. 

I absolutely love phased trial, cherry picked information fit narrative wanted came shit vaccine participants. Bold move armchair virologist. actual participant P3 trial, you‚Äôre wrong, worse, foolish. 

Now let‚Äôs hear Moderna‚Äôs breakdown, similar except sever cases. full shit too. 

So fucking disrespectful man. Studies matter kinds things often going immediately apparent something's harmful health. eating meat diet result deficiencies long term? increase risk certain health conditions? That's something going intuitively feel trying out. eating restrictive diet, need look actual medical science make sure getting proper balance nutrients. Honestly dont think optimistic hurting americans. Canada, constantly reminded precautions need take, serious protocols. government telling us essential travel wear masks times stores. time optimistic, Fauci. time educate public deadly disease yes, definitely late stop spread. Like way continue spread everyone it? Likewise :) Happy holidays!! :) Yes, Dr week IBS &amp; trouble absorbing nutrients especially fat soluble ones like D. months two 50,000 IU week I'm barely malabsorption. people would good one megadose like 50,000 IU week please go without testing retesting. 3rd lockdown, blame everyone going keeping peoples livelihoods going whinge mass unemployment excess deaths Covid. I'm sorry loss. lost 2 relatives way summer.

I'm work home, masking taking triple precautions, made deal myself. can, going put ventilator, try thank taking care telling matters much.  would real shame US doctors nurses allied health staff saw healthcare systems across Australia New Zealand recruiting. Places large, properly funded public healthcare systems, private hospitals providing services well little things like guns schools (so mass shootings every day), strong drink driving seat belt laws, longer life expectancy US, much lower levels crime, higher human development index well.

Edit: Oh almost forgot important part: almost zero cases community transmission COVID 19 Australians New Zealanders fucking demented gronks pandemic able parts control it. vaccine coming. soon. wait more.

Sadly, vaccine silver bullet, several reasons.

Expect still thing least time next year. Declining, still thing. commercial spaces. Restricting people hanging friends/family damned near impossible track completely disagree level authority state. example, attend 8 person Thanksgiving dinner. completely outdoors, separate tables inliving people, wore masks indoors using restroom. I'm giving up. Quercetin too, zinc. Zinc fights viruses quercetin lets zinc cells easily something. Sadly lot parents think important kids socialize risk getting lot people sick.  Nurses essential workers getting tests. lot employers really want employees getting tested. wonder new years rockin eve look like Legit walk outside office live age endless convenience thought sort inconvenience become enough bring people emotional extremes. agree people probably get magnesium balanced diet doubt Americans general eating diets consistently get enough magnesium. looked list magnesium rich foods can‚Äôt imagine average American eating list get adequate magnesium dosage. paused business salon 10 days. Hoping clients, thanksgiving know caught something. Honestly clients really careful. It‚Äôs coworkers concern me, hoping time gives buffer see coworkers sus. sftp cumbersome us. wrote script automate it. Nonsense medical professionals receive stipend 400 800 rubles reinvigorated comrade. /s Besides that? Australia New Zealand invent excuses feasible. heartbreaking decisions, envy you. numbers? Oh right......shitty. [IVO report approximately 20% care homes suspected COVID-19 infection receive individual medical assessment accordance law. According 8000 people care homes confirmed COVID-19 infection November 23. would mean around 1200 people receive individual care. Probably bit fewer since happened spring. course say anything received *incorrect* care, accordance law. Good hear! Interesting chicken pox shot wasn‚Äôt rushed clinical trials Shit im ready try see they'll let start going back office ""tick vaccine"" mean TBE vaccine, fairly common vaccine take, least spend time outdoors summer.

The difference vaccines swine flu/covid vaccines vaccines went much longer trial phases, meaning long-term effects probably get noticed. I'm hoping best. times social distance slow, right say C-17 coming fuel would pile pickup truck heat running windows rolled wait land marshal in.

The crazy part know virus real, none believe hoax, refuse wear mask. Zinc (showing help taste smell loss many patients) vitamin C. failed science, right? nice see public servant leads example. practices preaches. Cancelling Thanksgiving X mass family. wish leaders like this. Question much surge resulting deaths.. way things going, wonder people actually want die. Like they've enough callously travel would rather dead. USA dropped end Bucket list really compare 30 second Tik Tok dances school subjects math science (which already extremely difficult learn person)? must child virtual school right cause that‚Äôs definitely one weirdest arguments topic I‚Äôve heard.  work floor talked icu staff doctors patient good deserved last vent last icu bed available. chose 38yo 79yo (who passed later morning day shift). lol dude nothing ""the nature working healthcare"" Could given something nothing? although kinda fault, anyone running country also know 21 year olds can't expected make good decisions. make bad people, makes young. Truthfully people 20s overwhelmingly safe Covid. know freak cases, need weigh risk/benefit, occasionally seeing friends many young adults main cause this. real issue people either go work home parents etc., half country wearing masks till month ago hopefully vaccines don‚Äôt dogs onboard. Otherwise flight attendants make store overhead compartment entire flight die. Mom!! pharmacist likely administering tens thousands vaccines next year, want see data I‚Äôll take myself. There‚Äôs nothing wrong waiting analyze data efficacy safety, especially light fact able develop quickly. 

If vaccines turns safe effective preliminary reports say, marvel medicine right discovery penicillin. want see data. anyone give selfish reasons stay home? family member young risk conditions, tell scared virus. also don‚Äôt care much public health. safety vaccine like breastfeeding mothers? I‚Äôm pro vaccine, wondering cautious I‚Äôm breastfeeding. wish epic moron contributed something. eagerness Americans subs close schools really blows mind Slimy fermented soybeans? What's like? :)  Looks totally normal Android phone browser. start alive? would pre-story.
Like World War Z. we'd never lol /s know shape right now. already told school system blatant disregard state mandated safety measures (to open) something happens son hearing me. dont that. dont test. Right glutes. whole world would need cooperate. Imagine happens lol Beijing duck president That's pretty much Reddit does.  Thanks. meant soon get second shot. 95%% actually. people sense purpose lives. It‚Äôs utterly empty void recklessly chasing debauchery hide reality. Thank you. keep seeing word discussions Republicans shady stuff win elections. I'm glad I'm using word correctly. care Biontech German not? know what? founded turkish immigrants, go.

Also, born Germany, parents German. New York underground ""parties"" time. difference they're trying shit middle pandemic. cash money, green. Yea know haha, really look appetizing It‚Äôll challenge convincing logical people chuckled told vaccine would ready immediately election ..... Yeah, article betrayed lot biases, implicitly admitting expect teachers, librarians et al social guidance councilors babysitters. wait till Christmas New Years. would say it‚Äôs safest others may join birthday continue careful perhaps make plans year. aren‚Äôt first person miss birthday year, given risks it‚Äôs unfortunately great decision get together many friends without informing possible exposure. Others could easily vulnerable family members. No, false. 
The form fill says ‚Äúhotspot‚Äù, live hotspot, declared yellow cluster-zone, theyll randomly test students week. wont test staff. Staff need get test own. children picked randomly. 
The whole reason schools low positivity rate nobody testing unless yellow, orange red mini cluster zone. 
ALL students tested tested again. Cuomo advisers told school board keeping open, despite every week, new school outbreak throughout state zipcodes stupid clusterfuck strategy. 

So, following:
1- sick teachers severe symptoms testing positive. 
2- sick students symptoms testing positive. 

Theyre testing ANYONE schools unless show symptoms do, send cityMD.  used CFR people 60 divided 5-ish. I'm trolling anyway. knows haha liberals bed China. got near unsafe levels 5,000 vitamin daily. careful. deficient overcorrected. doctor really concerned blood test. said recommends 1,000 2,000 max. test positivity rate. antibody rate.
Across country around 10% rise diwali exception Delhi surrounding suburbs. Delhi rich afford social distance far even cases declined reaching peak around Diwali.


If data India correct South Dakota reach herd immunity soon. around 35% per Youyang Gu's estimate. seeing city city hit herd immunity around 50-55% current restrictions ( schools big events closed) Gotta buy Pfizer stock real quick üòÖ I'm teacher -- normal life -- goes tons concerts, sporting events, theater, etc. I'm definitely ""bottleneck"" type person. Meaning, contact ton people regular basis protected would slow spread since ping ponging around germs vs someone works home rarely gets house activities.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That's want. issue americans love brag things multi-national efforts (like moon landing, example). Like BYOV (ventilator)?

Oh better yet: BYOICU? IFR best estimate 0.7% according CDC planning scenarios. Well, bed takes care patient. would love believe doctors spent college time become superhuman that's expensive, turned nurse sidekicks weakass normal human like need lameass 6 hours sleep Ramen noodle, even emotional support. Sigh... stronger? Long story short, felt school remained closed. Believe me, I'm right you. reason everything opened money. Michigan, watched Republicans strip governor power close businesses schools wake covid-19. understand businesses hurting small price people dying. Trust say understand macroeconomics know jumpstart economy. wealthy big business fighting philosophy four decades ironically group can't wear mask. Now, away runaway stupid start listening logic. mean living it, means ignoring it. That's solution half country going along. idea, guy, interstate, intrastate, types travel would banned.  I‚Äôm quoting guy specifically article. actually says nobody leave neighborhood 5 weeks. guess could easy people simply can‚Äôt that. isn't. News say apparently reliable moderna vaccine. Lol, south dakota 40% test positivity good good you! immunity trickle 9.52% hospitalizations COVID-19 patients according official HHS data. That‚Äôs low vs states. 

ICU 74% full(all patients)

72.48% hospital beds full CA. mind hospitals businesses, I‚Äôve seen 70-85% business usual. Thats lock forever Reddit comments obv. basically March Cuomo forced stay open DeBlasio calling close. Let DNA changing begin her, district. We‚Äôll also need something next inevitable coronavirus pandemic Even then, unfortunately folks even care get ""they're young bad them"". Pretty fucked way thinking. people ask I'm scared disease 0.5% chance killing why. really depends weight/BMI. 230lb woman husband 270lb man 10k IU per day blood levels measured internist 50 ng/ml, healthy level. I‚Äôm 170lb I‚Äôm 5000 per day perfectly normal blood levels. 400 u (near homeopathic levels) 150lb, blood vitamin 27, 30-50 considered optimal medical community continues education. taking 4000UI/day fine then? Nyc schools reopening, upstate schools closing due many positive tests.

It's vicious cycle. Please don‚Äôt gather Christmas unless guests quarantine 14 days hotel room (or preferably, home) __within driving distance without stops__ gathering location.

Other that, postponing gathering and/or pivoting Zoom another video call app safest option, plus help contribute greater chance normal summer. I‚Äôm personally combo both. Virtual Christmas December 24-25 in-person Christmas whenever it‚Äôs safe (probably June July).

TL;DR
- Easiest Safest Option: Virtual Christmas
- Hardest Safe Option (but pull everyone inside without masks normal Christmas): 14 Day Quarantine
- Don‚Äôt gather without quarantine Except NYC time prepare testing capability since basically first major city US hit massive outbreaks. Florida time nothing done. lock homes 5 weeks leave neighborhood

and arriving flights California's airports roads leading state? ""it difficult decision, believe politicians, billionaires celebrities essential workers."" front cover

I know QLD NSW definitely not. QLD brother law manages hotel army (BNE CBD) NSW short stay Sydney March federal police army (Marriot Circular Quay) Good point. agree statements. wish system wasn‚Äôt backwards rich famous always win everyone else comes last. Cuomo forced DeBlasio open schools. Cuomo said theyll close hit 9% positivity.  Bars, schools churches closed.. silly keep open. go far requiring people show proof one go certain places

Even so, dubious. suspect many many people wary taking vaccine considering extremely short time took develop it, fact know long term implications vaccine; long-term effects may take years manifest. Stopping people certain things basis genuine reasonable concerns vaccine bad idea. someone works room make contact. 

Close contact defined CDC someone within 6 feet infected person cumulative total 15 minutes 24-hour period starting 2 days illness onset (or, asymptomatic patients, 2 days prior test specimen collection) time patient isolated.

If work room someone, depending occupation, chances within 6 feet longer 15 minutes 24 hour period. literally followed sub, you‚Äôd rebellion western countries lol. know horrible thing anyone go through, woman's behavior helping anyone. blame her, likely made everything difficult acting hysterical. definite. People care anymore. People care hundreds thousands people die. Thank you. won‚Äôt look good time Christmas &amp; New year get underestimate selfish young new yorkers are. Sick shit movie plot Russians Chinese source virus. üòâ  Man, I've Japan countless times never natto, F took spouse 7 days receive result, I'm Reno. getting number labs reporting results within 2-3 days? ""Flight 370"" Learned hard way. used deficient, doctor recommended 2,000 daily. Instead took 5,000 daily, doctor freaked blood test next physical.

DeSantis entered chat Alaskan resident, yeah place going hell back right now. article says number cases low Diwali festival stayed low after, interesting. 

But says antibody positivity rate ~4% 
Doesn‚Äôt need ti closer 70% even think ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù? Five years hence, still people sub Reddit general calling lockdowns. Mark words. me, reading headlines like really number person‚Äôs mental health? Well yeah, that's open in-person classes. think barring abusive situation, high schoolers fend online learniong. Middle school edge, family friends middle school kids fine online. Yeah, crazy. know lot people tested weekly bi-weekly work come hear stories nurses can't get tests all. PPE. N95 masks respirators work, apparently lot hospitals don't? makes sense.   Seriously though. It‚Äôs like choices are, ignorant facts (like many choose do) mental clarity, ‚Äúknow‚Äù many facts super paranoid depressed even frustrated stay ignorant. entirely (but agree BS), cannot discriminate specifically churches. write law limits gathering everywhere  equally fly. aware. ideas lockd9wn seem be, 'hey guys it'd great stayed inside while, dont dont want to. state went flames people go outside. numbers dropped. reason California hope. see really looks like. Imagine FDA actually fails vaccine. spirit humanity shattered, especially USA. many people resolve continue social distancing past April.

Stocks probably drop 20% one day happened. Didn‚Äôt Fauci say weeks ago we‚Äôd point return couple weeks didn‚Äôt improve case counts?

I may honestly thinking wrong person. club got busted knows many underground clubs NYC whose owners never caught. Yeah seen S&amp;P 500??

Celebrity. Close hotels airbnbs except essential workers like happened Spring travel would big problem. 

Not outbreak like we're remotely blamed incoming travel. would joke anything funny it. Community spread worry moment.

Remember, stop spread absolutely much bring transmission rate one keep prolonged period.   contracted Moderna Moderna produced US (more specifically northern regions US), well Switzerland, shipping logistics easier countries School remote. Grocery store workers can't. Well, minor quibble, shoppers shop remotely, safer workers, actual grocery store workers cannot remote. Even clients remote, workers go actual store.

Schools entirely remote (in much US). teachers teach home. students learn home. Admin administrate home. done home, keeping everyone safe COVID transmission. republican party Florida scientology clearwater. I‚Äôve hearing people support school‚Äôs opening alternative worse.

Look South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, China, Vietnam etc..


Fucking anywhere followed rules.

New Zealand considered number 1 freedom index. ""mUh fReEdOm"" god damn valid excuse either.

Mind live state Australia 14 cases? We're things old times.

I feel bad Americans right thing dragged idiots. cast out. hope new Covid card arrives, required want government function - license, support etc.

Don't want science, that's fine, morgue road. may ask yourself, ""Well... get here?"" might everyone Working age adults Fuck, I'm ICU Dietitian, usually see 1-2 dead bodies every months. COVID, I'm seeing 4-5 week.

I've seen people flatline never come back. draining heart goes nurses, respiratory therapist doctors. see far me. said around September toward beginning pandemic, I‚Äôm surprised pretty close estimate. said we'll spike covid cases opened schools (no need prophet there). People work children already either covid least quarantined. whish lottery numbers easy guess. us would rich majority society would still het wrong. one dude store wear mask, look cool think do.

I live Mat-Su valley idiocy infectious COVID Man wish medicine sushi Sadly true. However I‚Äôll interesting compare virus surge thanksgiving vs Christmas... let‚Äôs see holiday deadliest (no offense intended don‚Äôt downvote oblivion). Every action life could impact people.

I‚Äôll give example, go hiking, without much gear. get lost, personal locator 406 sat beacon. weather bad rescue helicopter crashes 4 die.

Is answer ‚Äúban hiking‚Äù? answer better awareness education, voluntary compliance. seem like style  They‚Äôre likely little busy countries, true Next year won‚Äôt 2021, it‚Äôll 2020 2: Sequel. Per pandemic LOTS essential workers, enough vaccines. Give front line docs nurses. TikTok worst thing happen internet since Twitter. feel like needs something done Social Media. fine line rights safety COVID misinformation awful.

On FB feed, dude keeps posting 10,000 COVID deaths, numbers inflated, he's medical experience, citation, etc.  People listen him. He's literally created army people mock it.

So point stop free speech? usually infectious two days symptoms begin five days after, new analysis finds. hair stylist, cosmetologist, etc Oregon get license revoked following governor's orders. FYI r/unexpectedgoodplace Well federal government made clear they're providing assistance. people need help now. Would surrender job, living situation, car, marriage/gf (if applicable) possibly reducing viral spread? That's asking people do. Kind catch 22 though it? close bar business becomes hot bed virus then, would forced shut down, likely end less customers one several die virus. Besides lack sources suspect claims endless ad hominem attacks, I'm sure they're great. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article much likely businesses/events simply ask everyone wear mask check person's proof vaccination. don‚Äôt think Fauci calling people like you. put food table, choice like many people. However, gathering thanksgiving choice. Yeah, small gathering Thanksgiving family worked home and/or retired. quarantined beforehand, double triple checked safe, still largest group I've since March. politicians. Everyone. Everyone excuse family gathering necessary isn't. ""Granny last legs, family 27 needs fly 7 different states one last holiday together"" argument 100 million families make. Remove emotion equation: gatherings dangerous. Period. Yes heart wrenching story gathering elicit emotional response me, gods sake people please stop one season. break laws? Genuinely curious

Maybe could revoke license Truly! glad TV anymore, I'd probably news on, crying everyday. Where's ""rounding corner""(red stapler)? going look tacky celebrities post photo getting vaccine ordinary folks. Interesting New York got different decision: Jim Jones, Church kill members.

Yeah, makes religious leader qualified judge safe attend church? Thanks. So, shortage, stay till people get back working medical field.

Different countries, different rules. happened places, face lack medical professionals: nurses, gp, medical students... know people vaccine exposed virus? instead quarantining, social distancing wearing mask? Many people get reported side effects even though they're temporary. Believe not, R 7 million traveled plane alone. Yeah younger cousin going school nursing Im proud yet scared future. insane control we've let virus get. Really? Hogan excellent badgering PG MoCo bringing kids classroom numbers dramatically climbing? well book launched, bailed, turning decision making counties, complained PG, MoCo, Balt city open up. Hogan excellent, maybe Allegheny county would rate 135 per 100,000. flight attendant quarantining home? understand certain people like diplomats quarantine like 8 days (I think) rest supervision home. I‚Äôm guessing boyfriend there. Honestly area it‚Äôs like nothings changed lockdown. Shops actually felt even packed lately. Quite non essential shops still open. I‚Äôd shut bar government offered next year revenue me. Good choice! You‚Äôre right thing friends anyway. know it‚Äôs hard- im extrovert miss everyone everything. It‚Äôll okay. mean [this rap sheet thicker Moderna. exactly literate matter, ya? Criminal. certainly expert, would doubt ever claim 100% efficacy severe cases. point, unlucky person may get severe case. even so, great news. Oh jeez, vastly different. Umm maybe 50k biggest concern. think chicken pox/shingles. know COVID means 10-20 years now. Hell, there's huge number long-COVIDs 6-8 months past initial infection they're still suffering end sight. hell people keen risk this? Maybe license practice nurse needs reexamined state board. there‚Äôs one thing take solace it‚Äôs Americans literally can‚Äôt care enough get point societal collapse. 

Hopefully don‚Äôt stress test particular ‚Äústrength‚Äù americans though. Covid-19 first mRNA vaccine tested humans. mRNA vaccine method tested safety years ongoing clinical trails. 

I mean good still going get vaccinated. Better many people refuse it. wanted inform information concerned there, look it. 30:0 ratio obviously isn‚Äôt massive sample size 30:0 also significant can‚Äôt ignored. Maybe isn‚Äôt 100% reduction severe cases vaccine definitely reduces 98% more. stop. sound ridiculous nobody wants antivax bullshit think big part human nature. Humans social creatures interaction people hard-wired us. think biology starts override critical thinking skills point. Thank you!! Same, prepared summer cancel season. didn‚Äôt, assumed would taking bunch precautions. watched first game KC 17,000 fans stands said fuck Putting others risk thanks medical financial ignorance. Strong work Yeah... back quick... people always protected society protection disappearing... best time crack perceptions protection confront energy... really fun! Side effects indeed rough. extreme arm soreness days point lift arm whatsoever. Nausea night of. Bad headaches 2-3 days. Extreme body aches.

But temporary! Same. arm might tiiiny bit sore day two. Got tdap booster july flu shot october. little bit soreness. Like me. WFH job home office. bike garage. You‚Äôre talking Bay Area, aren‚Äôt you? I‚Äôm also Oregon Trail Millennial (1984) well fucked since graduated high school. Doubly fucked grew Bay. Really shitty frustrating. Fauci claimed manipulating commodities lied March utility masks. mendacity one thing liar certify. telling someone literally writing law school paper lol mean, one bit embarrassing, stressed people still need little bit fun Sorry, mean states can‚Äôt go bankruptcy? I‚Äôm pretty sure every state debt. today ""Stay home well day""!  also Mason jar day meth awareness day. Sounds like you‚Äôre wish Floridians doing. You‚Äôre good, brah. thing is, entire world locked much China Australia pandemic would May, one would talking caring vaccines right now. lockdowns would months ago. think that's hard conclude given small number cases. dozen infections vaccine arm total. total number severe cases 30/196 15%. 

If vaccine made difference severity chance getting symptomatic infection all, expect fraction cases placebo arm vaccine arm severe. roughly 1-2 severe cases 15% 12 infections vaccine arm would expected severe.

It's difference 30 severe cases landing 0-30 vs. 2-28 1-29. nearly enough data say certainty random came 0-30. That's really good news tested positive, even purposely trying contract it. Long term hidden protracted side effects. Remember...they're responsible held accountable lawsuits. Use ya risk.. Cautiously optimistic. 

There lot antivax people sadly. thread people saying trusting purely stock price... respiratory viruses get confinement facilities, continual opportunity replicate, mutate, reassort, recombine novel strains,‚Äù Gray explains. ‚ÄúThe best surrogates find human population prisons, military bases, ships, schools. respiratory viruses run quickly [human] populations burn out, whereas CAFOs‚Äîwhich often continual introductions [unexposed] animals‚Äîthere‚Äôs much greater potential viruses spread become could literally taken 10 seconds google related search term know millions Americans aren‚Äôt biking distance jobs right? heard pass government funding plan avoid another government shutdown soon might use force stimulus relief too. 

Here‚Äôs hoping get good news soon. once. someone explain something scientific studies me? essentially say 90%+ efficacy great numbers. people actually exposed virus? quarantining home? actually got real vaccine actually exposed virus reliable %'s? Long term hidden protracted side. Remember...they're responsible held accountable lawsuits. Use ya risk.. saw coming well, work healthcare tried warning people also brushed came learn one co-workers called retarded. Yeah... think one thing I've learned face even severe world event we're good fucked. still take much vitamin like wrote. I'm humbly suggesting people get advice doctor instead various online forums. blood test showed vitamin deficiency normal winter. told take specific amount doctor october march. Spoiled, bored fussy. spoiled. You‚Äôre gonna get it. They‚Äôve already started see significant increase throughout churches like disgust me. community church go extremely responsible. two services ten ppl, christmas program zoom. they've taking situation seriously. think contact tracing done Viet Nam actually become ***less*** aggressive. early days (think February March), tracing way F5 something expected. July so, F2s considered.

Still, yeah, combination aggressive contact tracing, testing, isolation/quarantine cheap effective method, humble opinion. ‚ÄúCheapest‚Äù probably cremation, goes religious beliefs personal wishes. know mother‚Äôs modest burial (most plain casket, simple headstone, gravesite service only) still cost thousand. There‚Äôs price tag everything, including death. 
My heart hurts people. Christmas/Hanukah/Festivus came early! made comment different post sub days ago got voted oblivion. I'm glad see post upvoted much is! Stay safe friend great day kinda hope happens. tired need to, asshole not. 

And get it, go store saying wear mask, Covid hard breathe.... got list stores still don‚Äôt believe real! won‚Äôt believe quarantine. Let gas pedal America! shouldn‚Äôt season Yeah, finishing Masters Degree Teaching, feel good, don't. one cares anymore fuck demon elf Yes try brace yourself. hard you. cousin PA army frequently goes FB tirades need people get Covid achieve herd immunity. mother, aunt, uses cousin's words arguments time cousin type authority pandemics. Guess 76 year old mother moment? hospital receiving 5-day course Remdesivir convalescent plasma Covid. Ughhh. two vaccines seeking approval vaccinations likely starting next month. past eight months hard definitely gives motivation stay resilient little longer. hate shots can‚Äôt wait take one. Traveling knowing risky itself. Traveling know real fucked up. absolutely correct stop one day spring/summer. happen people become inoculated, infection/ hospitalization/ death rates drop faster faster things gradually begin returning normal quicker quicker. We‚Äôll eventually hit rates equal seasonal flu back 100% normal (not taking account economic fallout). vaccine supply exceeds demand April I‚Äôve heard US, later May.

It‚Äôs light switch, it‚Äôs dimmer. Gotta give screenwriters wrote apocalyptic stories people lethally stupid. said wasn‚Äôt possible people make bad choices, yet are. live ny come state several times border checks read wikipedia article, it, incl sources One ladies office hopped plane Texas. Another posted videos Friendsgiving thirty people. patients 65 up. I‚Äôm fucking furious them. really difficult treat cultural issues lead problems like distrust ignorance modern medicine. Systematic changes needed education, support systems, knowledge economics, knowledge government, etc. Attending local town counsel meeting getting involved local government good avenue better change too. ""Balto-Air""  talking guy yesterday two jobs.  Neither shut down. says he's tired wearing mask. likely, understand need social distancing proper hygiene needed avoid catching Covid. Smh that‚Äôs shame. People damn nasty. sister law called ‚Äúscared little bitch‚Äù day husband cancelled Disney vacation suppose leaving today. trip booked family year ago. 

She‚Äôs still going....... That‚Äôs fair, hadn‚Äôt considered that. See personal feeling I‚Äôd really hate find family member left truck months, you‚Äôre right, unmarked grave would probably way worse.  Also stop talking neighbor. Quarantine! wonder U.S. would today aggressive contact tracing like , pair proper mask usage think would better place, moot point unfortunately great news. 5,000 IU Vitamin sale Costco, isn‚Äôt someone abusing prescription mental health drugs. Looks like lockdowns work work fast. It‚Äôs fault!! I‚Äôm essential worker too, it‚Äôs terrifying. I‚Äôm scared getting sick, I‚Äôm scared getting family sick, I‚Äôm scared getting coworkers customers sick. there‚Äôs alternative, make money eat eat live. It‚Äôs horrible nightmare situation abandoned governments exploited employers fault. hope easy day feel better soon. üíï Nobody believes stops one day, that‚Äôs goal is. Never was, never be. 

The goal move day day lives without covid rampant community. Children priority goal since ones driving pandemic. Vaccine elderly, healthcare, front line workers death/hospital rates plummet becomes much manageable. turn means get back things together living lives. 

All indications start US Spring. Hopefully Valentine‚Äôs Day isn‚Äôt problem either. Basically biggest day going eat restaurant socially un-distant someone possible. 

Also super bowl exactly week Valentine‚Äôs Day too... fast produce vaccines...? That's called slavery, no, cannot. Okay, thats believe. Bye. wait see covid Christmas! Lol people can't troubled wear fucking mask healthcare workers supposed risk lives them? I‚Äôm sorry. hope get better soon. takes 30 min shop grocery store, least respect workers keeping distance wearing mask. sub ridiculous. plan pandemic task force place type event current admin scrapped all. ‚Äúmay‚Äù

Will. course don‚Äôt believe that. people start get vaccinated, person person, situation start change. There‚Äôs doubt mind next year better year. next summer, go hang vaccinated friends options places go vaccine circulation, consider blast. European US collaboration get equal credit Even becomes inevitable, timing everything. getting collectively better treating it, quite protocols varying degrees success. I‚Äôve interested treatment vaccine limited immunity mutations. think come long way developing both. Dude didn‚Äôt shit go work go home moms, literally didn‚Äôt anything wrong. hope mom didn‚Äôt get it, nothing feel guilt over. 

I hope feeling better soon. Rona it‚Äôs fun time. Imagine quickly end covid, everyone gets vaccine severe reaction covid even 6% immune disease get it. Going need site sources. sent emergency text Rhode Islanders saying ‚ÄúALL HOSPITALS FULL. PLEASE STAY HOME. ‚Äù

What fuck doing? Contagion movie shit this? gotten far entire state gets alert like this, still half country couldn‚Äôt give less fuck. They‚Äôre selfish entitled won‚Äôt change single thing life public health without temper tantrum. 

I laugh anyone calls America last superpower, leader free world, ect. We‚Äôre superpower country way Trump ‚Äòrich‚Äô everything owns plated gold. It‚Äôs farce. It‚Äôs illusion. Anyone isn‚Äôt kidding knows it. 

In history textbooks, certainly point fucking jumped shark country. nice find, thanks addition everything reported here, Belgium also reports fare deaths Covid-related countries. Knowing countries *really* affected done mortality graph (I data this). Well considering thread uk I‚Äôm Uk. I‚Äôm talking know restrictions UK caused 1 million + job losses extremely damaged economy. Frankly don‚Äôt give shit NZ AU. Congrats thread UK died, 72, lived 1976 swine flu vaccine fiasco, necessarily deadly, cause Guillain-Barre syndrome 450 people, made others legitimately sick, pulled.

It similar scenario made highly political rushed vaccine, since similar strain deadly 1918 pandemic. 1976, flu strain end nearly deadly, risk developing GBS deemed worth (normally say risk 1 million flu vaccine, 1976 vaccine closer 1 100,000). 

Covid FAR deadlier, especially age group, impacted people 1976 swine flu, even slightly increase risk GBS another autoimmune disease, would still 'worth it' reducing cases, death, spread. natural immunity Covid, novel, swine flu novel would spread like Covid has. 

I 100% pro-vax getting Covid vaccine soon available, *do* slightly understand hesitation lived different (potential) pandemic saw harm came politicized, rushed vaccines. Science regulation improved significantly since then, covid pandemic legitimately disastrous, difficult overcome preconceived ideas, especially got sick 1976 vaccine watch certain news media hyping fear vaccine created 'too quickly'. hear? vaccine kept really cold. literally way that. We're going die. would good time buy Moderna stocks?

Yeah always smart buy all-time highs! thought back March. course do. Trump team took one minute console family person passed away due COVID 19, would take every possible minute May 29th, 2021. 

People look numbers large it‚Äôs hard put perspective. ""Guys, need take hydroxychloroquine *zinc*! Yeah, that's ticket!""

*Study shows effect hydroxychloroquine + zinc*

""Guys, need take hydroxychloroquine *amoxycillin*! Yeah, that's ticket!""

Fuck me, people. Let us medical researchers *do fucking jobs* stop armchair nonsense. Yea encourage people get vaccinated lesson chances spread millions people believe gotten Covid never verified told people infected immune people would try go get virus won‚Äôt get ‚Äú micro chip vaccines‚Äù think varied. first confirmed case reinfection symptoms second time. Another one mild symptoms second time. definitely number cases reported pretty bad worse second time. getting Rona. hey graduate top 10 class fuck know.ü•¥ü•¥ sad day learn .  subreddit dedicated combatting misinformation around COVID. know one lot facts, one bogus claims relevant information? 

Basically COVID Snopes, subreddit. much larger sample people received intended dose?

That Oxford/AstraZeneca trial, Moderna trial. Moderna Pfizer/BioNTech appear mishaps.

If turns Oxford vaccine really 60-70% effective versus 90-95% Moderna Pfizer vaccines claiming, might nuance whether approve Oxford vaccine all. first glance, think want approve ones work really really well, less effective one produced quicker, might best give highly effective one high-risk groups, let us plebs get plentiful less effective one. know two scary . somebody diet induced diabetes, hypertension, high-cholesterol, heart disease, asthma caused overweight considered higher priority me?

Because twenty times likely die? Yea I‚Äôm trusting Russian covid vaccine. American British German yes, Russian nyet Prepare worst, hope best logical compromise. üññüò∑ That's cause bunch retired publish nice report everybody likes look at. think 10th December It‚Äôs fake bro So, given New York lull past months, time used increase capacity? me, would obvious solution.  Nope, behavior different fairly certain placebo anyways. 60 Oh went wrong comment! meant reply someone else that!! Well defeat covid matter attitude is. matter many deaths rack along way . Even Dr note threatened live. Yes cashier eating queued stopped eating. It‚Äôs small family run store 11 seem like statistically significant enough number judge efficacy? actually prevent large number people getting infected all? That‚Äôs excuse arguing literally withhold care sick. Efficacy survival rate. risk reduction. example 10% chance catching disease unvaccinated, 90% efficacy rate turns 1% chance catching disease. Florida would great case study pandemic future!  yeah, would assume places organize similar COVID testing make appointments ahead time time slot show up. Black Friday totally safe, Thanksgiving family suuuuupper dangerous. 

If fulfilling patriotic duty consuming products ok crowd spending time family instead that's paddlin. yes, absolutely right, country country classification death rate versus serious case rate. Nice educated this, thanks Thank you! selection criteria Moderna test known published detail. ""Eligibility Criteria"" section headings ""Inclusion Criteria"" ""Exclusion Criteria"". Technically true. allowing high infection rates leadership increased vaccine development speed, would taken longer develop vaccine USA Australia levels. political know exactly Fortunately scientists epidemiologists design rollouts, general public.

And general public usually don‚Äôt dive deep bureaucratic language. hear ‚ÄúPhase one medical nursing home, Phase two teachers elderly high risk populations (the fine print homeless, prisons communal migrant workers), Phase three general population, Kids sometime later studies done. increases risk death covid 10 20% think. asthma careful would without asthma. say pretty careful, I'm locking still go food shopping etc. dunno got downvoted, vaccines boost immune response general.. Yeah gotta careful. Yeah we're stronger, bones joints made stuff ladies. anything extra strength puts risk since try lift things really shouldn't. answered question; pre-existing immunity COVID-19, terms raw numbers, even acuity similar flu (which decidedly untrue), much significant problem. typically much slack hospital system -- routinely run near capacity anyways winter, hard keep things near level novel pathogen without implementing restrictions.

Also, hospitalizations same; individuals hospitalized greater rates COVID-19 typically need intensive support, requires smaller nursing staffing ratio (more patients unit vs. floor). places limitations capacity seasonal influenza. It‚Äôs misinformation. Belgium isn‚Äôt making them. Pfizer is. We're driving imperial stout season beer world.

Do routine abusers high-gravity stouts get ahead cigar smokers? Asking a...uh...me. Oh irony punishing people actually care health protect don't. disgusting. Covid melts lungs renders survivors unable exercise level before. devastating active person much loss someone wants sedentary anyway. That's unfair thing it. schadenfreude-y part loving ""War Christmas"" Republicans screaming decades finally going happen...under Republican president, said Republican president's gross incompetence. What? got vaccine would probably alive Okay first realize BMI scale dumb shit arbitrary fuck even account muscle mass. Scroll down.... three-quarters posts articles horrible Florida right now. Think it. There's law large numbers. Yes, people survive...but many get hospitalized? every person dies there's like 19 need hospitalisation. cant give everybody care hospitals filled brim sick people. There's chance lasting damage. That's need vaccine. Protect go lives whole shitshow. Sickening. Sorry. man FDA going approve moderna phizer? seen cases increase look states seeing increase way, way more,‚Äù DeSantis said. ‚ÄúIf look per-capita hospitalizations, even close top stuff. think people put perspective.‚Äù

Just wait. Reprogram cellular infrastructure think even bit exaggerated, no? Rather, we‚Äôre giving cells disposable set blueprints viral protein. Yeah also tiny isolated island international travel hub irrelevant discussion major western economies. Despite r/coronavirus obsession you. mean, checks balances exist tenuous state imaginable. President telling people drink bleach, calling major worldwide virus outbreak Democractic hoax, single member party anything it.

A lame duck president attempting steal election -- one two members party Congress stood him. reason state total anarchy courts (which packed) still holding law.

That much thin wire walking, IMO. Oh, teacher. explains everything.  vague headlines frustrating. ""A weeks,"" ""coming weeks,"" ""weeks, months."" can't one people say, ""I think vaccines go people within three weeks""? Then, three weeks passed one got vaccines, could go person say, ""Why wrong?"" Good luck that! guest trying figure out, I‚Äôm statistician said back envelope math rigorous statistical analysis. 

In control group 185 COVID cases 30 becoming severe, trial group 11 COVID cases 0 severe ones. Well, managed narrow down

Oh *you* win internet today None happened city state. reason people stopped caring Fauci others can't seem give consistent message. summer kept warning hospitals overwhelmed....it never actually happened.

Now they're telling us skip Thanksgiving families yet ok kids schools people crowd stores Black Friday. Agreed. go stores plan. Grab go. Try efficient possible. lingering I‚Äôm north Texas too. Fort Worth/Hurst area. people mask lot wear nose chinstrap. Also, past week seems every single store PACKED right now. People also get like 2 inches behind I‚Äôm line QT dollar general. People like social distance. really can't find source data, everything read says exactly probably right everything except last sentence. say probably know selection protocols trial.
The last sentence doesnt make sense criticism, may clever. assume got spot selected sample excludes elderly inform etc, serious infection rate among whole 30,000 works 0.1%. much lower general population serious infection rate 0.16%. 
That think claim 100% effective stopping serious cases. didnt get enough cases get significant finding serious case efficacy. simply great reach. Still sure explaining well enough go it, would boring read still convincing I‚Äôm one bars drinking, want go get fucked shit done. Quarantine shattered see. wonder mRNA vaccine would work better new flu strains given quickly designed. future vaccines looks promising shitting cousin bigger part Healthy Every Size movement, she‚Äôs claimed doctors biased weight (she serious health issues it, hitting 30).

While Covid-19 kill everyone, still deadly. CFR estimates moved much last couple months, mostly due Europe good grasp many people sero-positive. top direct CFR, also long term effects post-infection complications seem kill cripple enough people. this, barely got idea what's going health care system bogged keeping infected people alive. probably take years good grasp long term effects fight those.

Besides: matter deadly deadly Covid-19 is, still want spread it. walk around bullet revolver play Russian roulette random people, you? everyone need vaccine high risk groups ? easy say this, planning eating rich? Sleeping playing video games doesn‚Äôt count. yes, article say wary censorship

To Quote

Peter Hotez, dean National School Tropical Medicine Baylor College Medicine Houston, said, ‚ÄúIdeally, want antiviral vaccine two things . . . first, reduce likelihood get severely ill go hospital, two, prevent infection therefore interrupt disease current phase III trials actually set prove either** 

And 

 Part reason may numbers. Severe illness requiring hospital admission, happens **in small fraction symptomatic** covid-19 cases, 

&amp;#x200B;

If read medical journal think, heck lockdown???

You see I'm confused understand correctly Covid simply minor illness comparable flu. flu shots taking? take annually worse got sore arm. vaccines consist Anthrax gave sore arm. Smallpox gave scar.  Yellow fever gave nothing despite warnings.

That description sounds pretty intense. Still want get better alternative getting covid plus killing spread (honestly unlikely choice, too). saying pretty big side effects. Wonder thwart people getting it, crowd ""flu shot makes sick get it."" (Looks American flag)

Fuck.... Ummmm thats pretty fucked Thanks friend :) Thanks friend :) I've effectively written half relatives consider family based actions last year choices beliefs last 5 years. dead far I'm concerned. coming back believe chose do. *"" continues generally well tolerated ""*

They've couple hundred kids test positive (that know of), several pretty sick, lots staff work positive hospitalized. They've since shut again.

There's support schools safely. can't open want to. issue stems way back beginning year, could mitigated early financial stimulus, *proper* shutdown.

Sure, *try* make work, changed anything *can* work. like said ""hey, installed new ventilation, we've opened walls allow proper social distancing, get side three times day, test everyone daily."" said ""well, people mad kids schooling home, let's open again."" provider currently practicing pretty sure reassigned hospital needed without consent. There's something Hippocratic oath that, think? Please correct I'm wrong I'm teacher, genius. Read carefully. Seriously healthcare workers need realize Americans literally give slightest shit way shape form go strike. want regulations passed enforced. American public isnt gonna it. strike best way get done. don‚Äôt know y‚Äôall I‚Äôm really starting look forward Monday‚Äôs good vaccine news keep getting. Everyone plays dumb hear Covid spread around hospitals care homes like wildfire. much respect appreciate efforts can't deny there's good segment healthcare workers clearly followed regulations. incivility best teachers, ashamed. anecdotal evidence. parents' neighbor sent home oxygen Thanksgiving despite multiple comorbidities positive test.

My wife's best friend doctor rural hospital, they're full beg big city hospitals take COVID patients.

Good question. Trump administration said ""So could seeing vaccines getting people‚Äôs arms Christmas,‚Äù

They also said millions test kits would available March.

They promised churches would full Easter Sunday.

They said economy would rocking July.

***EVERY SINGLE THING SAID LIE. WOULD EXPECT START TELLING TRUTH NOW?*** unethical? people sign trials knowing may receive placebo inherit risks associated that. hear you. Christmas hard season me, Christmas Eve one fave services miss year. probably watch online study done nyc chicago cases said household size lot larger predictor case numbers neighbourhood population density. cases spread household close contact also, iirc. underrepresented populations tend live larger household sizes income cultural reasons Nobody knows get. get vaccine get placebo told might placebo take precautions get Covid.

Ever since lifted visit ban, they've pushed allowing visits done safe manner. point coronavirus word people it‚Äôs sad It‚Äôs profitable help them. That‚Äôs country works. Everything built way maximize profits cost. That's biggest issue. schools also given money make properly safe either. whole issue stems back federal government providing proper stimulus everyone stay safe. Yea, it‚Äôll take months everyone get it, I‚Äôm feeling optimistic! Instead making people guess point is; don‚Äôt tell us argued? That‚Äôs risk personally take join trial. else supposed test real life? sucks believe also pick people high exposure environments anyway already would‚Äôve gotten point without trial, you‚Äôre supposed change behavior thinking you‚Äôre invincible. vet too. seem one taking seriously limited trips ""outside"" world. It‚Äôs interesting feel need publicly declare that. Why? telling wife, graduated med school nursing school year, pandemic unprecedented opportunity move incredibly fast. 

Kind like advanced rank faster war time soldiers. 

I know, it‚Äôs shitty think financial opportunities awful times, fuck it. Healthcare workers deserve every dime get right now. TikTok shape opinion, gave broader platform. blame platform?

For worth, algorithm TT good I've never seen anti mask, covid denying bs. obviously know nothing nursing. Colonel Angus entered chat. Fauci said end April would start ordinary folks getting interview. course everyone get right then, take months. work pharmacy I‚Äôve heard district manager ‚Äúvaccine consultants‚Äù, Pfizer vaccine stored regular freezers roughly 6 days. pharmacy planning ordering small orders using within 6 days known *all* China's neighbours closed borders them. knew something ‚Äì they've deal China's shit decades. result, many Asian countries performed amazingly well Europe Americas severely damaged. Restauraunts bars open state entire time. People counties others also gathering maskless. 

Saw couple news LAST WEEK COVID POSITIVE coughing place shipping dining Yuba city maskless. 

Here sacramento they're trying push dining/bars hard that's downtown economy based got new arena relying income (that people voted twice, btw cuz want financial burden)

Some places CA good masks gathering. Much state gave fucks. 

I cant give numbers right reporting paused Wednesday, know multiple small places like Yuba maskless covid couple 15 beds last week. 

I need surgery way. ""elective"". means gonna kill right now. Grapefruit sized tumor plus couple others. cant get hospitals trying save staff morons think Applebee's zebra club worth health others. 

Wear fucking mask stop fucking going parties evil shits. I'm even worst situation get fucked pineapple.  understand. going say plot Escape New York, since brought dome it, going either Truman Show Logan‚Äôs Run. would definitely good reason. looks like Moderna showed sterilizing immunity mouse data phase 1. said, tracked human trials contract tracing harder exists lot community spread. 

You raise good point though; sterlizing immunity definitely important, really sure near approved vaccines offer that. Based we're seeing previous SARS antibodies cells kicking activating presence current coronavirus, keep fingers crossed. Herd immunity impossible tests indicate immunity lasts 3-4 months many cases. quick people getting infected trials (Moderna got 192 infections already), J&amp;J's first interim results far, right? anyone link phase III protocol? means, die, due situation brought pandemic, would still counted excess deaths. Right ? less upset ""well, crap"". check back 25 July 6 March truly ""shit hits fan"" situation. found one confirmed community spreading case day. mild panic (albeit dies quickly top brass gets media calms everyone down).

Still, would chalk difference culture politics (supported media). case count Viet Nam low even +1 raise percentage, lot. Meanwhile, many cases US ""fuck it, stop caring"". Moderna saying shooting readily available anyone US Memorial Day. falls line government saying well I'm ready shoot vaccine. That's spun... utmost respect healthcare workers, understand many going beyond safe, personally, healthcare workers know also happen least responsible people comes social distancing/wearing masks/just staying home. know is, every single one parties, going restaurants, going trips, etc. disheartening. family cancelled Thanksgiving mom cancer obviously high-risk. besides that, felt like wasn‚Äôt good idea get together. However, one relative visited mom anyway drop pie... tested positive two days later. 

Now mom exposed, I‚Äôm really scared her. schools closed since March. last month, decided open K-5. weeks later everything closed again, many kids staff infected, several hospitalized.

Yet they're already talking sending K-12 back school January. see even consider thing case counts skyrocketing. Even levels bit next weeks, still ten times worse earlier year hesitate shut down.

Just get damn virus distributed, get case counts down, talk getting kids back school. Yeah, correct. definitely much worse smoking. Even front patients.

I really understand nurses doctors get it... 

Here Belgium minister health used doctor became politician. saying tv masks work late June... 

fortunately lost position due change government... ideal, though prevalent covid is, dad brother sure hell getting fairly regular covid tests many contacts everyone point.

But something don‚Äôt love study design. preventing severe cases number bit trustworthy don‚Äôt think so, considering people frail would receive ICU/IVA care anyway, ICU beds critical resource. Regular hospital care would overwhelmed 1200 extra patients nationwide spread several months, think. would probably strain system, overwhelm it. country decide. People fundamentally selfish real surprise that‚Äôs governments exist. Governments supposed rein stupid shit via laws enforcement unfortunately US government lost plot point, probably back took pandemic expose this. grocery store workers considered essential? common knowledge rapid tests polished shit need go inside house breathe everywhere, exactly? careful bothers much? Yep, saw people reacting page Lol, works haha. Decided little fun I'm glad found peace

No peace. suck less. one person household/family gets vaccine, like someone 65, members household/family get time. Especially since vaccines need two shots, two weeks apart. like say inefficient, place blame others, clue male better professing intimate knowledge. Figure out. periodic PCR testing? Mitch fucking McConnell block every form covid relief You‚Äôre lucky. damn tdap makes arm hurt week! I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs needed every ten years.

Like whole ""70% need immune herd immunity"" thing applies every single person infects exact amount people. reality, contact tracing studies found 60-80% cases come 5-10% people. 5-10% also far likely get virus, reasons spread it, meaning virus infects first.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* assume 15% population immunity means enough. vaccinate RIGHT people could massive impact.

Healthcare workers older immunocompromised would big win.

It would mean less transmission, ability nurses help sick easily, far far far fewer deaths. Regardless President is, outcome would exactly same. Even right ""let's personality"", Presidents USA powerless w/o full support House, Senate, Governors.

Now time drive defensively, use turn signals, brush teeth floss well, eat healthily get sick. chances health care safety net do. Public Service jobs/those needed keep services running grocery stores, imo. Yes, worse. also assume stupid, selfish people well.

If remotely self aware. numbers efficacy continue come seem like much effective typical flu vaccine. reasoning improve flu vaccine well? are. Hey case anyone knows, terms manufacturing production good bad several seemingly working vaccines? vaccination attempt need produce billions better many factories cranking one thing uniform easier multiple factories cranking multiple things work?

Honest question anyone familiar kind project management take away anything said, man... much researcher team would incredible, live conscience. 

There realistically nothing could/should done differently, damn, that's gonna weigh while, imagine. never found good primary care physician. Specialists usually incredible PCPs seem apathetic suffering. frustrating. 2 things: A) side effects cannot pretend side effect injection site pain fever day anything close DEATH. calculations, IFR 0.08 overall, chance symptoms around 60%. Maybe equate symptoms side effects, I'd prefer bruise left arm feel sluggish trouble breathing.

B) virus magically stop 30%. virus accelerates time goes on. Unless something stop it, like... vaccine... one claims get sick spread virus.

Just look OP's Fauci noted growing research showed spread Covid-19 among children significantly lower among older demographics, Covid-19 cases largely stemmed high-risk environments like bars indoor Fauci said ‚Äúthe infection rate among children much lower one would‚Äôve thought‚Äù added: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs much better close bars keep schools open keep bars open close schools.‚Äù stores require everyone wear masks

that's funny, store USA? Enforcement joke.  Things like fast-food drive throughs inconvenient people pay grub hub deliver fast**er** food. We‚Äôve developed entire industries around idea enabling laziness. around MI stores packed Black Friday sales. Dick's, Harbor Freight, Target. 
Damn, yeah work Office LA. staff 50+ age. Pretty hellish right now. Fun fact: random antibody test 20 staff working since July. put Calciferol 60000IU 6 weeks course back August. Today 15/20 tested positive Sars-Cov2 antibodies. None symptoms. Mumbai. shows badly virus ripped local population. anyone link story doesn‚Äôt require subscription? Yes exactly, thanks clarifying. 

As 2nd point. That's good question. I'm really sure that, possibility.  nice urn also looks like statue.... Sorta Sedentary lifestyles, poor diets. can't, simple math tell us why. 2017:

- 5.8% Americans aged 18-44 went hospital
- 7.9% Americans 45-64 went hospital
- 15.3% Americans 65+ went hospital

When COVID overruns healthcare system, people cannot get medical care need. sure live without care, without decent care, number people die lack medical care _VASTLY_ outnumber people die due COVID (which still best estimates somewhere millions ignore it).

Shrink labor pool 10% economy retracts permanently. Shrink buyer pool 10% property markets collapse. Industries communities collapse. Shrink healthcare labor pool (which skews older) 10%, there's 10% less healthcare go around. entirely insignificant affect quality life, workplace safety, general health, meaning people need healthcare lack access it. 

When come gloom-and-doom subreddits, read news, hearing thousands deaths nationwide day - that's system working well. COVID grave threat species, everything manage slow much. Yes that's bodybuilders, OP say shitload muscle mass. BMI also slightly make taller people seem fatter really BMI makes shorter people seem thinner really BMI too, slight (maybe point so). It‚Äôs one thing without something little bit, think Reddit underestimates impacts restrictions have.

Now, I‚Äôm restrictions regarding virus, shouldn‚Äôt act like socially isolated 8 months good someone‚Äôs mental health. 

I‚Äôve noticed changes worse family members began, included. everything we‚Äôre supposed do, it‚Äôs exactly enjoyable  Damn, may looking first time Ohio State-Michigan Rivalry game isn‚Äôt played since 1917. wife teacher, sentiment respect disappeared first round remote learning. initial ""wow teachers lot"" quickly turned ""I help kids school work paid teachers' salaries! teachers holding office hours school responding emails 10pm next day's tasks?!"" 

Now parents blowing school much students are. 100 middle schoolers, emails go 40 parents multiple times per week regarding kids' missing assignments, 15 parents schedule conference, 25 email grades posted wondering kid F... 

She never worked harder right now. planning grading take long, remote aspect led students parents check amount effort spent tracking assignments everything fail 40% kids would rather play Among Us insane. said, thank sticking it. least teachers families still appreciate you. I‚Äôm glad reported cause death. Easy forget many dying virus. Someone allergies? cold? coronavirus?

 Also ever worked food service before...? let tell you, I‚Äôm saying food gets sneezed shit definitely happens that? motivations someone want hide it? I'm new asked questions safety vaccine rushed, say anything negative vaccine, honestly concerned can't wait take long safe, get downvoted.... actually able choose? stats teacher told something statistically significant, u need least 30 samples. Wonder scientists went school  like Grosjeans crash yesterday, took others lives save his. unfortunate saved, eventually save somebody. website hugged death can‚Äôt load it. Though predict quality mask protect you. 

My favorite imported Korean KF94 masks. I‚Äôve used behealthyusa authentic. BOTN DR Puri brands tested well Again, need ""bulk"" population vaccinated see decisive decrease number cases. Even 10% would enough see sharp difference numbers. 

Again, July, COVID last breath western countries SURE restrictions held harshly 6 months. 

By March much measures left (closure restaurants/bars/lock etc), July place, hence ""normal summer"" statement.

Sure I'm giving view here, I'm expert, feel free quote this. uk gets large proportion food continent lorry, close border starve. certainly locked sooner better testing earlier elimination strategy never going feasible stupid pretend differences countries. Test trace also works properly case numbers low, endemic boat sailed Jesus, shut forever then?

When correct time reopen reopening point result rise cases? think it‚Äôs families first act actually. Sorry that. Really? That's surprising I'd think schedule like would unpopular almost anywhere try it. Migrants homeless people prioritized general public. Though may well efficient way distribute vaccine. guess taking next couple weeks analyze data, December 10th 17th day make decision exactly placedo vs. treatment clinical trials existing treatments often considered ethically dubious. Obviously pretty much impossible vaccine though.

Crossover trials often used existing interventions drugs certain conditions. also often answer practical question healthcare system New Drug X better existing drugs Z? non essential businesses applied essencil granted except mom pop. Covid-19 response hell joke. didn‚Äôt gather thanksgiving still got rona. actually made point spend alone picked weed guy instead. masked. got typical flu shot week ago, say so. haven‚Äôt addressed production rates, would seem major bottleneck getting vaccinations done. idea heard estimates fast produced. I‚Äôm anti-vax means, I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm bit uncomfortable compressed testing schedule, especially seems companies allowed testing little oversight. cause terrible? It‚Äôs US lacks capability contact tracing, value privacy established form government respects allows us freedom government surveillance intrusion.  I‚Äôm 14 still hate this. trying invalidate point, last 8 months sucked. people doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it‚Äôs easy.

I know good portion Reddit‚Äôs demographic introverted, that‚Äôs good them. everyone same, bet it‚Äôs safe I‚Äôm going I‚Äôm totally board identifying origin right reasons. I‚Äôm skeptical version SARS-CoV-2 meaningfully change away terms infectivity, symptoms, immune response characteristics, nevertheless science worth investigating.

What take issue great many people sub interested science/epidemiology side this. really point fingers China/the Chinese government/nominal socialism. people downvoted me. Oh boy Anti-vaxxer, though hope immunity getting lasts.

Too fucking bad many can‚Äôt get covid get immunity way genius Time test result also relevant times like also think mRNA given partially immunocompromised patients contain virus. instructions cells produce spike protein immune system could try fight against.
Hopefully there's dosage makes enough spike protein even folks w weak immune system could T-cell response. us, healthcare workers/high risked, know? hope gets approved soon possible. Correct. point, haven‚Äôt done research virus see like flu like chicken pox, though. evolves time like flu, wouldn‚Äôt unreasonable assume point everyone may get strain it. it‚Äôs like chicken pox measles, would need vaccine. haven‚Äôt heard immunologists said that, time tell. examples behaviors viruses, either could likely opinion. But, like said, immunologist, relying experts watch determine. think that‚Äôs many treatment options still investigated. Well fact strains sars much deadly, work done covid could potentially used those. Also participant, symptoms first week like described nothing long term lasting. ppl already responded you, want reading own, god starting point would probably [central severity rate control group woule unlikely even mitigating influence disease strength all. 


Like, great, claim irresponsible, simply 11 cases get severe cases 1/6th time pure chance. Cool, amazing see scientific progress made short time point target populations likely end soaking healthcare specifically hospital resources.

If healthy 60 pretty small odds going severely impacted covid. wearing face masks allowed things prevent *other* people getting it, likely cause real damage you.

You barely need vaccine all. issue comes clogged hospitals high risk patients hang around weeks getting therapeutic care straining health system. ""The median time onset symptoms enrollment trial 8 days.""

I‚Äôm sorry claim knows people who‚Äôve died vaccine highly dubious. needs present evidence back claim needs quit proclaiming little bit fiction. Normal summer? Lol

After first dose, need wait 2-3 weeks 2nd dose takes 4 weeks full immunity kick in

That‚Äôs 6 weeks vaccine make protected. bulk people get May June vaccinations (assuming first available April), you‚Äôre looking July August first wave ‚Äúaverage Americans‚Äù immunity.

Fml.... too, Dr. Fauci, too. sounds like experience, except never given vaccine infected back March. Strange works way, it? Whatever effect is, doubt worse child(ren) *dying*, killing one parents, grandparents, etc., ... That's misinformation. CDC numbers. Download raw numbers Tableau chart check out.

I've come across hundreds women ""body-positive"" promoting intrinsic value self-worth, regardless current weight (which, them, upper threshold typical body weight scale).

There's reason rarely see morbidly obese people (who obese whole lives) beyond 50's. It‚Äôs vaccinating many people possible. Vaccinating rate needed reach herd immunity fools game would take way long. 

It‚Äôs vaccinating people would likely end hospital. point giving elderly obese first reduce load hospitals. 

School age people extremely unlikely end hospital COVID. article May. well like 50% x 94% = 47% mean really matter. Situation supply limited, waiting days means doses available first wave vaccinations. family permits it, name vaccine him/her erect monument something. person died name saving millions others. wanted see gymnastics like id go circus.

of course economics professor would spread nonsense, [death toll full bloom. hope right. I've seen reports much 20% US population refuse vaccine able. clarify people involved trial got vaccine vaccinated? Yep, getting flu vaccine years (worked university: got right campus, students stressed get sick spread everyone).

Us library? Don‚Äôt cut back services circumstances Experts: Things really bad right getting worse every day. difficult asking people travel holidays year.

Americans: I‚Äôm gonna start traveling even harder.  prove gutted point ineffectiveness, words, dissolved it. hard. task force last 9 months? One question (my need /r/askscience find out):

Are concerns efficacy number ""inflated"" factors (i.e. social distancing, masks) variables cared studies? keeps saying likelihood dying 0.1%. 

Why people bad math? think 0.1% = 0%? tiny sure, scale results millions dead entire world. someone get it, well could him. I've noticed deniers see personal risk, see tiny number, move on. see danger see risk society whole. Yes, know browsing sub, East Asian countries utilized national lockdowns view last resort prefer using mitigation measures keep COVID control longer periods. countries like South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, never national lockdowns. Socially anxious lungs Yessss stick please~~~~ It‚Äôs enforced live Times like I'm glad dog needs lot exercise.

If memory serves, Illinois done something similar even extended veterinarians. zero enforcement. Nurse works dayshift. go 0100 shot IDGAF. there. Died participant vaccine trial horrible public message. Explaining part control group way hard seriously People might autonomy incentive help themselves, food environment become progressively unhealthy US wherever junk food industry taken root. think terrible timing. I‚Äôve tried 5 times several shoppers drug marts GTA family doctor. time said vaccines got day, out. professional sports able continue, even outbreaks? investigate died. need die become number. That's it. That's excess deaths likely way people infected. Many friends getting sick got tested work precautions tested positive. gotten tested work.

I suspect way people like getting tested. No, Republican Governor revoked.

Abbott revoked shutdown curfew. You‚Äôre treating disease severity disease occurrence independent variables, though. likely vaccine suppresses mild symptoms highly effectively effect progression disease past certain point?  Moderators better job daily posts...
They filled health related questions, jesus. confidently - vaccine become widely used, almost certain someone vaccinated severe symptoms, say right expect rare, based currently available data. oh jeez LA = Louisiana, LA = LaLaLand, Cali?

The former, well know lot Southerners feel covid precautions. latter reflects toxic workplace culture.  Name calling surely get people listen you. Dude let fear control life. Washington DC bigwigs using mask thing control population. need mask dive. Water literally made oxygen (H2O). See ""O""? That's right. might wrong think bee injecting vaccine veins. believe claim one bit. Right?! selfish. Yep. They're getting first. WI experience. Went well respected hospital ER area deep gash leg needed stitches horrible experience. 

They left lobby awful open bleeding wound 2.5 hours waited bed open up. nurses came check kept getting paged could much slap bandaid leg. 

When finally got bed could stitch up, waited another 30 min within time saw least 3 patients rushed stretchers going covid ward. 

In normal times I‚Äôm sure would‚Äôve hospital hour. scared injury thought anything worse happen probably wouldn‚Äôt get treated wouldn‚Äôt get treated fast enough. That‚Äôs precisely vaccinate high risk people first, though, young healthy essential workers (outside people caring vulnerable) partying spreading disease. point good one, hopefully within couple months longer matter. Please don‚Äôt spread misinformation. Abbott faults order mask mandate back summer soon get vaccine I'm 100% giving flying fuck regulations, Americans feel same. want everyone vaccinated, should, can't tell even vaccination can't return normal another year even months. That's going fuel anti-vaccine sentiment. 

They're vaccinating vulnerable first, time us healthy low risk start getting there's really reason go back normal. say old people died something else labeled COVID. Currently residing Florida. 

No one surprised. What's saddening many would preventable.

I protect love.

For thanksgiving... brief. small. outside. Masks worn unless eating different households ate distanced tables. bit windy out. people left grace meal itself.

Yet STILL risk situation, but... feel could minimize it. isolate pretty well every day life we're putting one outside circle danger.

But that's family. number families US took none precautions going depressing results show weeks. Yes... around Christmas :/ Facebook feed confirms this. many pictures large groups together eating indoors. Yup, already happening, people purchasing fake negative COVID-test results black market...this different. -_- safe. global event, hence *pan*demic. creating list people may able rely on. one forced work. planning purposes. hit club first thing damn pandemic get blackout drunk mates... let‚Äôs face weren‚Äôt going read None speaks fact even delayed, nobody would held accountable ‚Äòhell pay‚Äô. mean? vaccines cheap seeing reports..Phizer Moderna Astrazeneca reasonable..and profit, deserve Lots data shows strong vectors contagion schools academic centers, argument ""protect education, protect children"" sure easy buy, quite naive.

You get large fragment education effectiveness telematically get zero contagion.

Are gonna less effective, yeah doubt.

Is everybody suffering pandemic naive think children must bubble expense wellfare others? Yeah, naive.

So getting 70% education effectiveness exchange removing one largest contagion vectors brainer opinion, always cut summer schools one month recover educational drawback.

I bet entrepeneur would give 1/3 holidays year get company economically hit Don‚Äôt blame people. held long could without government relief. choice homelessness battle virus people handle, I‚Äôm choosing virus. Alaska law means mail-in votes can't counted week election. ridiculous, that's took long. see point concern people asymptomatic covid spread disease too. friend's mother-in-law died covid contracted domestic help asymptomatic. even survive week infection. Keeping mind, worry conclusions derived particular study. baffling test people show symptoms. Watched it. Loved it. Hated ending absolutely nothing explain anything meaningful. Thank this. feel like many people react short lived shock news shows rising deaths, lot area havent yet touched devastating is, they're taking seriously focus losing ""a lives"" versus living normal life. cannot forget people, right. 
As everyone saying thank you...I awkward never know respond. Thank recognizing best. Hug medical professional. None us feel best enough right now. still try. person nothing dangerous average person. 50% chance getting vaccine. 

It suck, close vaccine, infected purpose. possibly.... think that's FDA currently researching &amp; strategizing. One vaccine candidates needs kept sub-zero temps remain stable could hamper distribution rural outlying areas. may mean 2 vaccines we'd able vaccinate twice number ppl logistic constraints. Agreed. whole experience really depleted tolerance anti-vaxxers, anti-science, medical quackery loving people. ain't it. 

He volunteer infected. volunteered part study whose participants 50% chance among first world receive vaccine already shown effectiveness producing antibody response could prevent infection. 

Homeboy got infected time would without part study. Umm laws books many countries seeing surges well... 

also seem crazy... trump actually fascist would seized complete control US- likely force allowed elections due covid... think people understand ask times consequences decisions.

Stay home next 4 months... part, stop complaining everyone else theirs. person asking everyone else be... do, take government. Well, thankfully people actually know they're charge dumb March sure. understanding outbreak bad, forcing play likely expose Steelers Ravens players still testing positive. enough roster team point?  free agents pick get tested too. go anywhere enough regular, I'm sure anyone could possible know whether I've going last 9 months not. I'll believe get needle arm. Forgive dont believe word anyone says anymore. Ah, non sports fan idea rivalry means us Can't make accurate test.  totally made vaccine!  Toronto Canada made pretty quick easy get flu shot well. called able get mine day. No. making list call on. Questions smarter me...

If take vaccine, still catch covid almost never severe. That's huge huge huge deal homerun efficacy. 

My questions... 

What asymptomatic cases. (where even know covid symptoms). I'm assuming still happen people still infections? 

What % vaccinated expect get infected/contagious all? even happen? vaccinated people still get covid same?  called healthy-user-bias studies. alternative closed till vaccine enough people? Okay argue opposite well supported. think vaccine distribution uptake far exceed what‚Äôs physically possible? Feel free ignore reluctance public get inoculated, don‚Äôt even look far. ‚ÄúShots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, 
 Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, 
 Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots‚Äù

‚Äî Lil Jon  explained difference Broncos control outbreak, could identify exposed removed everybody exposed via contact racing, whereas teams plays tomorrow struggle they're circle people quarantine growing everyday. Last checked barely enough people fill active roster even pull every available person practice squad

Ultimately probably right though haha I‚Äôve thinking lot too, live theater. I‚Äôm fan Broadway actually NYC (on trip planned anyone knew COVID was) day Cuomo shut theaters March. Looking back got city time lucky didn‚Äôt catch anything. reopen (hopefully next year), it‚Äôs gonna weird sitting large crowd close together, year half distancing. I'm skeptical many carcinogens tobacco weed well. Smoking anything healthiest way avoid cancer. NHL 24 years summer. Worked well, least terms Covid. watch [The Man High 2020, I'm entirely sure reality I'm living in. I‚Äôm honestly sure, point closing airports would cripple country. Give break. must hard function brain that's shined smooth like marble. Yes, true! apart herpes sub people freaking believing life stigma. herpes 8 years seen people treat talk others it. lot people ignorant it. stigma would definitely go away viable vaccine could truly prevent transmission. hope see one day people predicament feel ashamed anymore something can't change. Heres hoping best stay safe! testing vaccine, get pool volunteers test on. 50% get actual vaccine, 50% get placebo fake vaccine real benefit. limited number people know got prevent bias opinion affecting results. participants even know got. testing phase vaccine, someone got placebo also got covid-19 died it. Original commenter saying sad family person died going see gotten placebo, person would likely still alive. hand, died name helping prove vaccine going work millions others. takes certain kind learning deficiency look current results lockdowns advocate new ones.    
How one, allow people opt medical treatment covid return free disregard restrictions covid. Sounds good, it? People go shop party socialize freely run huge huge risk taking away urgent medical care capacities.   
You fine deal? mean science weird sometimes, data supports must something it. IIRC theory posited something nicotine/smoke filling ACE2 receptors lungs virus typically attacks, leaving virus nothing attack lungs -which lessened chances catching via air lessened respiratory symptoms virus even catch it. majority 65? way spread students social distancing classroom probably needed another class. may also time period deeply sanatized. maybe school issued computer outdated work appplications programs needed distance learning, Teacher allowed connect personal computer Schools network security purposes. Haha Lol like said don‚Äôt think everything getting sneezed yeah people gross you, sometimes work food service. It‚Äôs little risky cooking home. That‚Äôs all. Love keep giving people excuses unhealthy. don‚Äôt become obese show gym 4-5x per week

Yeah, do. know plenty people gym 3-4x week (or pre-covid) they're obese. Strength training burn many calories. take look pro wrestlers. guys work living many definitely fall obese categories. can't lift fork. Probably so, though read depends type surface, idea safe amount time would weed. to, half idiots would still busy camping gamestops PS5's instead. ask us test free (at facility) think we‚Äôve exposed even mild symptoms. would catch asymptomatic case unless coincidentally scheduled one regular check-ups, 1 month 3 months vaccine. allow delivery services like instacart. dont. least area.   see point view agree, feel like exhausting options help frontline workers (within possible parameters) help them.

Plus, I'm always going err side optimism encouragement since frontline workers already know abysmal situation. Telling suck really help all. :( Thanks. I‚Äôve since become 6 time marathoner well, stranger mental physical challenges. there‚Äôs denying mental block severely overweight obese. It‚Äôs much even small changes either seem pointless enough. one make people see themselves. Rhode Islander here: really, really well like August numbers started slowly going again. Schools reopened growth slow down. October blew past spring peak state refused anything ""pause"" fix problem. way vet sees it, reduce number animals see 25-50% maintain cleanliness office keep staff safe. longer ""boarding pets"" Meanwhile, midwest: ""noone could seen coming""  Cute. states like Georgia businesses protected sued due catching covid enter premesis, long sign door. I‚Äôm think he‚Äôs talking cases leading end year time vaccines lot ahead terms immunity since 30% natural immunity Same. stopped week 2 month period, cases went down, shopping curbside pickup/delivery stores. sad. wish would stocked TJ's staples cases went again. hospitals overwhelm 2 weeks, death rate goes 10%+. 6 million dead.

I've banging hospital-overcapacity-affecting-mortality drum much anyone think overly pessimistic. Even limited healthcare support seen estimate showing COVID mortality 10% worst case scenario people ride home. 

It need high unthinkable consequences. Even hitting 2% would result incredible loss life. Honestly, country gotten cases severely decreased. know long immunity lasts, large portion vaccine's effectiveness herd immunity generates (not individual immunity).

I'm healthcare worker large hospital, potentially getting vaccine earlier others. continuing social distance really see cases drop.  that's another six months, it. available Ohio. wouldn‚Äôt want actually *do* something meaningful stop surge. really sucks relies government. can‚Äôt crowdsourced? could even give access contacts would cross check it. Since it‚Äôs self reporting, there‚Äôs hippa issue. no, isn‚Äôt great privacy standpoint. However, people give apps access contacts far less important reasons.  don‚Äôt even wanna look news less year. tell hospitalization data. hospitalizations surge know Covid wide spread community.  hospitalizations surging, widespread community.

THAT SAID, millions upon millions people country COVID. rule thumb take current positives multiply 5. High end estimates every one person tests positive 5 additional people positive never get tested. give idea upper bound many weekly positive cases are.

Not mention, antibody tests cross react common cold corona viruses. don‚Äôt know many people tested India antibody test used, could easily get number testing high prevalence pocket using antibody test cross reacts across corona viruses. there‚Äôs one thing count it‚Äôs American public fucking up. mean, look around. Ketogenic diet created help children specific form epilepsy shown also help alleviate symptoms people bipolar.

There almost science saying long term health risks using weight loss plan. people using also doctor's supervision also generally misusing diet, intaking dangerous amounts red meat specific recommendations world's medical authorities. 

Tricking body thinking state hunger bypassing fat production likely safe human body, probably brain either.

CiCo diet safe effective long term basis. Anti masker? would suspicious two completely independent drug companies different stages testing suddenly ready go market within couple weeks other? can‚Äôt tell serious statement. way make unhealthy lifestyle choices too! next? Influencers, famous TikTokers, people simp E-girls, Jeff Bezos, PS5 scalpers real essential workers need vaccine first worked hardest quarantines. We're already rolling Ya know it‚Äôs one thing upset incorrectly handling pandemic precautions, thought maybe hair make gives pep step need take care patients dying cancer? Maybe makeup hides bags eyes?

Her hair makeup way impacts situation better worse, every right presentable. link form article read local online newspaper. high rate community transmission locally. filled form called me. Well, you‚Äôre likely doctors came college past 5 years.

In US GP‚Äôs, nearly every physician see 7 plus years since graduated college med school residency alone. don't. give half vaccine half placebo. people know got vaccine placebo. told go live normal lives see happens two groups. thought didn‚Äôt take research money, taking logistics help? Oooof yeah I‚Äôm touching this, yikes. Going forward 2 weeks now, sure. utterly nothing needing right now. They‚Äôre still going harms way sadly.

The issue rules Trumps ridiculousness means many places won‚Äôt even enforce it, terrible  That's hoped for. Thanks. That's valid concern. People already immunity vaccinated previously infected going display exactly susceptibility infection and, infected, viral load transmission patterns we've seen far pandemic herd immunity virtually zero. means high risk groups still high risk groups.

With SARS-CoV-2, there's reason anyone high risk groups (including immunocompromised individuals) tends first list vaccines along healthcare essential workers. 

The objective vaccines, none 100% effective 50-70%, get enough people partially fully immune insulate everyone else (be people can't vaccinated, vaccinated, develop immunity vaccination infection). look ""herd immunity simulator"" similar search terms, there's good visualization tools show immune individuals insulate everyone else. work home. also feel shot foot, fucked life, pay consequences going scary world everyday serve people like you. conceited attitude have. consider quite successful make good money. also consider LUCKY work home. people work keep electricity on, groceries coming doorstep, etc, sit home feel superior them. better are. see you‚Äôre misunderstanding what‚Äôs said doesn‚Äôt change fact I‚Äôve said correct. sure burden proof explain mechanism easily accept opposite, incorrect narrative. thought data new, public quite dangerous. socializing? Mixing households risk-period. said wife weekend, hope Covid never took him. Gah...gutted. world spin around California. Except grocery stores everything closed Germany example. Thanks! feel fine headache sore throat. would died anyway. placebo change body way. decided become relaxed thought vaccinated, that's him. trials thorough informing MAY getting placebo accept many times. 

In fact, case rate placebo group lower national average. people probably even careful typical.

Glad sense see even nurse handful dunces tiktok right thing wouldn‚Äôt change damn thing millions still hitting bars every weekend. US weird culture ""ask doctor medicine"", elsewhere, guidelines weighing medical concerns availability dictate given what. Even States, probably one covered insurance options privately pay another something. Okay, let's rework calculation then.

2 million new cases detected. say undetected cases outpace detected cases 2-1. would give us \~6 million actual new cases two weeks.

Then use 0.6% estimated IFR. 0.6% 6 million 36,000.

So, using CFR 2% gave us 40,000, using 2-1 ratio undetected detected cases IFR 0.6% gives us 36,000. Sounds like CFR ballpark. would assume smoker fatally allergic cigarette smoke. Imagine smelling smoke lengths would go order avoid terrible deadly smell. Window open, towels door, etc.

It really serious. one want part long-term organ damage.  remember beginning, read news headline.

""Economic downturn due pandemic china"" LOST SHIT.

3 fears happened year, threatened, may still happen.

Economic depression

Pandemic

China's economy bursting (extremely bubbly real estate particular) taking everything else it. (I fear real estate bubbles due 2008 college graduation year)

I'm lucky I'm asylum. lol certainly asked that, let boss know comes time Without additional detail really hard know start looking answer. Perhaps serosurvey caught COVID test also identified another coronovirus time? 

Even IFR lot lower test high positivity rate would result millions upon millions bodies past year. accounts happened. implication either know nothing COVID's IFR, population India different anywhere else world, survey took somehow flawed. People telling others follow rules break applicable? Really? kinda true, sort historical meme. 

Back day, women allowed doctors, woman smart enough doctor ended nurse. field finally opening women would-be nurses doctors, leaving hole filled somebody else. 

It's probably super relevant anything last couple decades, lingering effects might still exist degree. conspiracy cover neither reasonable possibility 

Of course is. What, trust Chinese communist party open makes sense

Without vaccine:

With vaccine:

Well far study group goes. quite impressive results. 'Modern life' product broken capitalist system controlled overclass multi-generational oligarchs.

Thanks advances education technology, productivity per worker increased dramatically past decades. yet workers must work longer ever meet basic needs? leadership? ""According what? We've trials 10's thousands participants, issues whatsoever. ""

So think 20 thousand people issues short time testing, one ever issues?

My opinion -- logical thing ramp new technology. Let's 1 million people test 2021, maybe 2-5 million 2022, slowly start ramping 5-10 years, carefully observing results. heard profound quote reddit topic: 

""If punishment breaking law fine law really exists would economically distressed fine."" 

So know would good option here. think definitely valid see fine affecting poor. nurse, feel ashamed people. responsibility educate lead example. wonder can't get general public take things seriously see nurses acting like this. Unfortunately, years, I've worked many crazy plain stupid nurses question world ever made nursing school. People like damaging profession. Doctors scientists worked vaccines deserve treatment too. Still amazing vaccine developed quickly. happening pandemic anyway? mean hell, swine flu back 2009 completely tanked immune system. I'm quite immunocompromised case considered severe (though absolutely sickest I've ever life), immune system freaks absolute fuck everything - developed allergies I'd never before, pick colds super easily linger far longer used to, etc. think often pretty minor reaction far less severe virus one, still managed impact life pretty substantially. worrisome. right shot want take? make sense. Nobody cares shot want take. That‚Äôs probably downvoted. Say again!

A second opinion medical condition revealed first doctor lied straight face ordered unnecessary invasive procedure need.

The second doctor told tests really showed said definitely going non invasive option.

The first doctor trying make money. Period. Lying sack shit. charge world (and I'm stopping count vote cast), NBA would start season till vaccine distributed. abbreviated 2021 season, that's goes. NHL. NFL would pausing season right now, plan 2 weeks regular season football establish goes playoffs well shake rust, playoffs..perhaps March April. establish bubble situation playoff teams. 

I admit enjoying NFL season distraction reality, want expense health involved (yes, late that). nothing would send bigger message nation NFL shutting things winter get stuff back control no.

A provider US gets job like anyone else. Yes employer could try reassign them, provider could simply quit terms contract. contracts I've seen 90 day outs, reassignment would take time provider hostile, especially new privileges needed. could also pay penalty violation.

The Hippocratic Oath legally binding, know doctors take since contrary medical practices like surgery. take Declaration Geneva, again, legally binding. smallpox outbreak Montreal, need happen except French Canadians scared English vaccine?


How ironic. ""How long? Long!""

-MLK  Rip guy died covid placebo trial You‚Äôre worthy time Concern trolling every fucking day. mods? think understand you‚Äôre asking... mean current vaccine trials? so, scientists many professionals involved vaccine studies similarly bound harm. Now, keep mind means literally says: *do harm*. Keeping mind, taking informed consent consideration (participant fully educated risks/benefits, agrees participate) person giving injection whether placebo vaccine harm. Injecting person placebo harm. Injecting person vaccine, it‚Äôs cleared safety trials, harm. participant informed risks advised still follow covid precautions. So, harm done participants.. makes sense? literally clear gets. Nearly 200 people caught covid, 11 vaccinated, rest not. mean less people got vaccine, less people got vaccinated caught covid. That's great list, seen polar express watch year! Hope kindled. Exactly , I‚Äôm young person don‚Äôt want chance covid. Suffering long term fatigue losing smell/ taste sounds miserable. Hell, even sick 2-3 weeks sounds bad avoid it. People forget typical ‚Äúflu‚Äù lasts 2-3 days. saying side effects vaccine worse actual infection (for people 40)?

Vaccines traditionally huge money makers. Sure, Pzizer/BioNTech Moderna may end making billion two this, nothing compared Lipitor Humira $75B+ profit drugs. NY/NJ area unfortunately stopped sometime summer. Tacoma, though imagine easier manage situation much smaller city NYC. Regardless, we're going hear many, many stories pandemic profits always put ahead well mere employees every industry. lot nurses overblown egos - almost sort defensive Napoleon Complex.

Just clear - speaking general terms. usual ""doctor"" Nurse Practicioner amazing, professional, believes Covid real.  bad bot Yup. vet fit one girls hours even emergency know exotics vet within 50 miles. normally emergency vet, slots available next days long term effects:

1. Long term effects modern vaccination much thing, ones I'm aware couple issues may may linked H1N1 vaccines, namely type nerve problem called GBS type sleep disorder called narcolepsy, vaccine *did* trigger them, manifest within couple months, max. ""effects years road"" never observed, despite lot monitoring. 
2. mRNA vaccine vector spike vaccines believed safer traditional vaccines, deliver Covid signature spike whole dead virus like H1N1 flu vaccines (The flu vaccine might possibly trigger GBS/narcolepsy flu able trigger GBS/narcolepsy, vaccine supposed mimic infection, times immune system over-reacts). spike vaccines lot targeted, much less likely over-stimulate immune system cause neurological issues.
3. fair skeptics, mRNA vaccine vector spike vaccines relatively new, know way cause long term problems mean risk free. However, general public expected get vaccinated next spring, nearly year data first batch volunteers. 50% people develop cancer lifetimes. 185 symptomatic cases placebo group.. occurred ""sample size"" define small vaccine worked? LOL no. nowhere near end tunnel. months, years, go normalcy.

Get ready wear masks next months. don‚Äôt even bother seeing loved ones. long vaccines don‚Äôt sterilizing immunity, wait everyone get them. much worse

Nah dude lung cancer horrifying. uncle slowly wasted away skeleton drowned fluid lungs. spread brain made super agitated aggressive. So, want pandemic reign 5-10 years??? realize safety tests already conducted, vaccine deemed safe, right? Almost vaccines cause issues long injection. rather take something &lt;0.001% chance causing side effect, rather risk getting something 0.8% DEATH rate? understanding correctly? point. Introducing new restrictions, even 'only' slow spread, would reduce strain hospitals vaccine distributed. doubt it‚Äôs much. look like cheap prizes given winning game carnival. clothes look like t-shirts probably home. think suddenly putting glass lid metal trim zapper? Oh also peed leaves raking - still rake seconds later instead simply turning 90 degrees going grass. 

That's garden variety stupid/senility it? 

Still shocked them! LOL. lack empathy genuinely sad. part problem. work willing get vaccine many not? standing policy need stay effect long time requiring mask usage public? They‚Äôre correct though :) Whoa amazing news It‚Äôs allowed long it‚Äôs anti-America anti-Trump. good move. Everyone know tested positive wedding month earlier.  And? everyone(well people anyways) never died covid either. lot states spiked seeing spikes now, maybe nearly high.

And considering restrictions said places lower months ago... they‚Äôre likely way breaking records coming weeks again. chance dying plane crash millions one. chance cargo damaged flight probably tens thousands one... There's lot cost splitting IMO, Im gonna lose sleep Schools open safety standards enforced absolutely need playing spectator sports right now.

The lost wages concern too, I'm worried jeopardizing job time like this. We've pumping money schools decades thing show worse results. Money seem problem here. No, due holiday weekend. grant/funding

I mean sure generally widespread problem like cancer, gene therapies, getting money/approval hard part. tricky part clinical trials due time recruit patients meet criteria actual study. studies ran 3 months trials run 5 years monitor long-term effects. Sure development shortened due money/red-tape cutting biggest time saver (like 90% time saved) straight 3 month trial vs 5 year trial.  put perspective 1 1250 chance dying infected. elderly 1 100.

Your chance dying flu approximately 1 10000 comparison.

Percentages deceiving. 3 days since thanksgiving. time caught covid presymptomatic know spreading it. Keep guard up. .08%....

You‚Äôll never guess hold Senate next round stimulus. would big proponent review everybody‚Äôs social media get vaccine. minimize virus anti-mask, go end line... hasn‚Äôt proven doesn‚Äôt either.  Maybe instead scared, trying prevent needless death another 200,000 Americans another 1 million long term health consequences. Oh god flew United.

I‚Äôll pass aware neither pfizer biontech received warp speed funding? bit funny take money development remain independent deliver first doses.

But ordered what?


Pfizer, BioNTech‚Äôs vaccine supply deals:

European Union, 200 million doses (option: 100 million)

Japan 120 million doses

U.S., 100 million doses (option: 500 million)

U.K. 30 million doses




Source: 8) refused let internal flights happen let international flights continue. matters at-risk people get vaccine, assume less 60% probably like 20%. people chance get vaccine pandemic considered people. anti vax people still dying that's really problem everyone else hopefully safe stupidity. personal attack priorities; many safe affordable places yards... rural areas. Life full trade offs. 

Once take personal attack parenting advice. know situation better do. commenting phenomenon observed.

p.s. love username isn‚Äôt coming couple weeks Trump said. still needs approved FDA. Pharmaceutical companies always report clinical trial costs part ""development"". generally curious beside sarcasm, here's breakdown [NYT interviewed dude actually made Mr. Sahin assembled 40-person team work vaccine. Many employees canceled vacations Mr. Sahin authorized overtime pay. called Project BioNTech used technology never approved use people. takes genetic material called messenger RNA injects muscle cells, treat like instructions building protein ‚Äî protein found surface coronavirus. proteins stimulate immune system believed result long-lasting protection BioNTech quickly identified 20 vaccine candidates, began testing rodents. company lacked experience resources rapidly conduct major clinical trial. Mr. Sahin called Pfizer. two companies working develop flu vaccine since 2018, within day Mr. Sahin calling Dr. Jansen Pfizer, companies agreed partner coronavirus vaccine. mid-March, companies announced partnership.

Just said, Pfizer comes drug ready clinical trials. industry norm. Sure BioNtech chance ever conduct rapid clinical trials own, I'd rather correctly attribute vaccine people who've created we're calling company's name. Yeah, agree you. Regular barbells, dumbbells, squat racks bench presses ideal, however staying away gym temporarily vaccine available don‚Äôt want spend ton money found fitness bags + pull bar combo work decently. much better body weight stuff towards beginning pandemic. point taken. aren‚Äôt gym decent gym set going lose gains. Sounds like excess supply given districts trouble finding sufficient teachers willing work. turbo-perma-omega-cancer-gigafucked Dude's anti-snake oil salesman still like him. 

I party, demonize guy party. one shitty thing.

I hardly leave house, can't expect everyone. Fair point 100%. Also, teachers staff also reckless spreading covid school??? Sure young kids may super spreading initially thought still loads cases school cant held responsible WHO.

*taps head* Ay hope Pfizer stuff works.

Bless FDA. ""gains"" noticeable start measuring 1940 something.

Real wages flat declining bottom 90% since least 1980, long coronavirus came scene starting time infected neoliberal virus. early data cherry picked schools Northeast far stricter regulations schools. schools EU/Asia also much stricter regulations.

Pick random school Wisconsin, SD, ND, etc. let's see virus spread schools again, especially secondary (middle school up). detected sewage first case elsewhere. could around I'm sure CCP try blame anyone apart themselves.  Swine flu much risk young people covid-19.

Link old article think still holds virus-related deaths estimated occur &lt; 65 years age."" Yeah ok China enjoy beer...and guns. Premium stuff. Cheers!  damage? forgot New Years parties! going exciting new years Wuhan center Virus Lab anyway? happened studying covid? still thing? bulldoze facility ground already? People common sense saying things, never would guessed. schools open mornonic, even know anything current state education system COVID-19. Grow dude. Well technically never late everyone infected Kushner goons show confiscate like ghoul med supplies? Anti-vax conspiracies invented CIA kill conspiracy theorists know much. don‚Äôt need look myself, plenty people look report data give presentations. again, keep acting like know despite inside Well you‚Äôll alive go like everyone else so. Bizarre you‚Äôll see true reality soon. Yeah, wasn‚Äôt complete coherent sentence. squelch doctors first reported it? daily cases daily deaths charts look exact Russia. doesn‚Äôt seem true country testing (and % infections confirmed) increases time. Russia increased daily tests since March?  I've left pages. becomes giant mess unprofessionalism constant arguing reason. what's problem? me, arguing rare people arguing beginning Flu kills people. is... moment... rare, given testing failures genome virus needs sequenced times counted re-infection means rare even happening regularly.

I'm saying is, information needed confirm everyone wants know kind hard procure factors like lack testing start this. large population asymptomatic people would even know would tested. lack genome testing early infections, quickly declining antibodies (only reason matters ability test exposure). time anti-body tests came out, far enough pandemic people infected early would way show that. saying exactly 6-8 months ago dubious best. Heck, saying even right problematic due asymptomatic people.

It countries test entire populations give us good idea. again, countries testing entire populations actually trying control spread would minimize odds exposed, especially second time. maybe time controlled studies tell.

I know, trying criticize, really feel could go either way point, seems dangerous say uncommon ***yet***.

Bring downvotes :D  Random namedropping makes look stupid. actually involved: take long, hard, look yourself. 
And Fosun hardly small shack woods. I'm imagining collective syringes waiting impatiently baggage mean, could given plan even included mostly open would worked better did.

We absolute dumbest fucking thing every turn.

The half assed lockdowns still enough torch economy, effective random sporadic, jack shit time bought.

What needed national lockdown, get PPE order, hire massive contact tracing apparatus, institute randomized testing region region catch outbreaks became widespread. Masks too, clear early on.

It's late though, conspiracy theorists fatigue, going get creamed there's vaccine. wealthy, chance? us agree wouldn‚Äôt care y‚Äôall nationalized insulin production. It‚Äôs 100yo drug - us involved bringing real innovations market don‚Äôt give fuck insulin - would prefer insulin people bring unwarranted attention industry. Ditto Epi pens. need fewer milton friedman ideas actually *Pretty sure* that's problem diet is. Super involved parents make massive difference. Assuming talking gen ed student sufficient skills, virtual student awesome parent absolutely succeed. sounds like making possible kid. sadly students parents arent like many arent. applaud wish like you. look case study number one significant portion call center staff got sick, makes sense know speech emit high volume infectious particles. ventilation significant source spread, people adjacent rooms floors infected. small percentage workers rooms tested positive. Overall, current data suggest virus unlikely spread unless share room infected person period time. survived consequence appalling human decisions, worst humanity. perhaps finally fall part human selfishness, sad. 

Of course perhaps wasn‚Äôt. wonder thought people‚Äôs perceived hesitancy protect other. 

Edit clarity Whatever say dude, that‚Äôs we‚Äôve submitted data governments requested (more USA Europe)...there may small third party trials elsewhere first party ones done us...but sure, tell know Dr Jansen Except teachers aren‚Äôt following protocols either. know plenty weddings, bars, etc. whole thing. Sorry, guys acting high mighty yet shit everyone else I'm shocked never got shortages anti-covid food like Bell Peppers, Apples, Fish. Meat packing plant workers? Factory workers? lot really essential workers who've laboring dangerous conditions keep us food toilet paper.

I think there's probably plan already designed smart people. know shared us. want rest easy knowing sister who's working covid patients get vaccinated soon. People embracing shows signs slowing. People flaunt new normal get ridiculed news social media now. Alberta conservative province, far susceptible ‚ÄúCovid hoax‚Äù bs  I'm doubting intellect doctors, I'm tired told teaching like people never taught public school classroom. mean can't definitive actually start seeing surge. could public housing / section 8 thats owes subsidies People need another stimulus. passing another considered crime humanity. I'm shocked people taken streets it. 

I realize people can't afford miss work emphasize greatly them. Senate wants stimulus gives companies immunity law suits taking covid safety precautions tax breaks large companies. House passed bill March help regular people money can't pass Senate. 

I concede people need schools open. breaks heart politics takes precedence people's lives little do. breaks heart (and brain) see many people going around maskless, endangering themselves, families, others due toxic masculinity unfounded fears oppressed. 

In ideal world, would paid stay home two months, everyone gets masks provided them. would 2 months action vaccines even needed. people make things difficult. Okay earth makes believe world adopt ""new normal"" end time? Humanity whole would reject let get right. 

You don‚Äôt trust world leaders. one all. don‚Äôt trust companies. Again, one all. don‚Äôt trust researchers. one all. You‚Äôre afraid might long term effects vaccine.

But friends got covid fine untrained, unskilled, uneducated observation (I assume hold degree infectious disease such) small number people. 

And clue long term effects covid. ok reasons.

I‚Äôll give straight. worked ‚Äúfaceless‚Äù corporations entire career. side office, corporate headquarters. small corporations Fortune 100‚Äôs. dealing VPs such, full C level BOD. someone cube side, someone usually part investigation team legal disputes (full NDA coverage see shit). career long old. aren‚Äôt nefarious. lucky make profit uncoordinated are. 

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre idiot. world isn‚Äôt get you. isn‚Äôt plot make money put something body. ones agenda furthered faking it. dick measuring contest get name attached best / first / effective vaccine without fucking up. questioning origin virus Wuhan might credible supporting independent investigation disease, instead authorities repeatedly proved Beijing seems focused question carry blame disease, understanding came from.

This news article reads like opinion piece. article makes good points, authors would well make less opinionated. Gain reading comprehension, disagreeing faucis initial statment masks. Never said anything wearing masks.

I bring OC word apparently gospel, saying saying today, would crucified. Actually kids catching covid higher rate outside school aren‚Äôt isolating. hang out, play sports shit downtime anyways. district virtual four weeks cases spiked due Thanks letting know, I‚Äôll remove comment. are, fact, trials. American trials European one.

And yes, sure, Pfizer lot work. No, BioNTech couldn‚Äôt own. end, calling Pfizer vaccine massive overstatement least bit disrespectful companies involved. BioNTech chosen GSK whomever instead Pfizer wouldn‚Äôt talking Pfizer process. working everyone? Exactly, sad comment way list too... interested adverse events affect approval process also last checked trolls almost 200,000 karma. thought Shhhh ruining AMERICA BAD. kind inflection have, sudden turn around like that,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, told ABC's ""This Week."" ""So clearly next weeks, we're going sort thing. perhaps even two three weeks line ... may see surge upon surge."" seems like another master obvious research article. People DNR status usually already significant medical issues. Comorbidity linking increased mortality COVID. Hey, link prove it... shows death rates first wave start second waves Sweden France. Sweden France first wave. incorrect need link direct somewhere shows deaths per thousand x time period (you decide this) France Sweden - testing capacity,

My link shows asked for... link testing capacity. genuinely think looked incorrectly!  think permanent stay. wonder many people comply show certs say, ""this HIPAA violation"", try sue discrimination something. Also, wonder certs would forgeable. put past people try loop hole shit seeing people handled things lockdown orders whatnot. Finally anthropogenic achievement 2020 proud of. Science. failed Covid containment, rainforest burning, on.

This needs happen way often. yeah Again, seems simply aware NYC cohort model is. scheduling kids school 1-2 days week + NYC schools 2 cohorts, typically 5-8 kids per class, vs. 35-40 virus. rule 65 sq feet per kid. worked almost 3 months worked quite well. satirical? hilarious Yup. hope everyone else‚Äôs sake they‚Äôre right, don‚Äôt know could live turns they‚Äôre not. couldn‚Äôt. Hope vaccinate millions December Pfizer Moderna vaccines. Jan - Feb, hope get good news J&amp;J Oxford reliable data. 4 approved vaccines February help greatly speeding supply distribution. people decide get vaccine. I‚Äôve travelled countries show proof specific vaccination (usually yellow fever) order allowed Yea, that‚Äôs figured. Says November 2020 I've heard fire departments respond lot medical emergencies fires days. smoke detectors building codes better ever fire safety paying off.

I mean, freakish thunder storm rolls dry California wilderness parkland bets off. (That storm woke whole family. amazing. ) r/karmawhore Sounds like safety trials thorough. No, we‚Äôre manufacturing, distribution, trials, one narrowed chose candidate, etc etc etc...‚Äùall‚Äù BioNTech create original candidates...if you‚Äôre going try argue this, try argue someone pfizer/that runs team responsible efficacy data involved since day one meeting Dr Sahin adapting. Frankly, used already, mean welcome go back ""normal"". fact think ""times"" last like three years absolutely bonkers. makes 70-80k server

This never tip lol. 80k putting plates table wtf symptoms improved think it? I‚Äôm curious everyone here, peoples thoughts things cannot review clinical trials? long term side effects pregnancy potential birth defects caused men women getting vaccine? huge fear unsure think want keep people safe afraid happen try start family. Honestly, probably unfortunately *Through end October, 2,009 New Yorkers buried Hart Island 2020, double last year‚Äôs total 846.*

*No one knows many people arriving died COVID-19. points, city overwhelmed bodies sent island authorities chance determine cause death track next kin. families chose loved ones buried here. families option. families weren‚Äôt aware relative died first place.* ""We definitely want people learn know mistake,""

huh? Wtf??? Yes useless obstacles aren‚Äôt added Yaasss go queen. fan since first discovered!! Can't wait U.S tour. Please hit city asap!! toddlers. Total opposite; usually peel can‚Äôt remember last time peed alone ü§£ USA needs Universal basic income helps probably thousands planes sitting around grounded.

And one manager United happy managed plug brand here. Well, no. shut things without support didn‚Äôt anything stop spread. evidence might different. Sue her. ain't different sex someone telling STD. get reported link prove figures used. 

You need link direct somewhere shows deaths per thousand x time period (you decide this) France Sweden - testing capacity, link goes to. think poster's assumption inaccurate, back figures directly refute ones find opposite. called adapting times. Get used it. Got it. Thanks. irresponsible. clinical tests US parts production - that‚Äôs hardly 90%.... Remember fear uncertainty felt March? feel now, right pandemic worse then, really bad stuff warned us could happen never did, actually happening now.

Pandemic fatigue constant propaganda downplaying virus causing major problems. We‚Äôre 91k hospitalizations exceeds peak March.

How people ok that? Things worse they‚Äôve ever we‚Äôre left dry: stimulus, masks distancing starting slack off.

It‚Äôs disaster. need strict stay home orders slow things vaccine comes like month now. Nation wide, questions asked. Pass temporary UBI pay people stay home. far good. They've covid infection amongst staff nothing reported regulars, either. You‚Äôll know soon. Pfizer unblind notify us arm we‚Äôre it‚Äôs approved EUA. 

As far side effects, that‚Äôs had, pretty lucky. lot us felt like hit truck day two second injection. Here‚Äôs hoping vaccine! speaking generally. patio fine. believe will, places kind already that. everyone antisocial introvert. Many people absolutely need physical contact social interaction survive (me included), hard people. I'm going everything safe, said done we're vaxxed, I'm going back living life. Feel free cower fear next decade. Great article. Thanks sharing one. \- currently estimated 34% Sounds par administration. It‚Äôs cheap Europe use treat alcoholism. I‚Äôm sure right place ask question I‚Äôm wondering well avoid covid apartment setting? skipped thanksgiving roomate went thanksgiving back worried catching it. Unfortunately rooms close separated door. door stop air droplets? time take vitamin D? Within 10 minutes preferably. Conservatives really didn‚Äôt think attack lol compare ""possible side effects include"" vaccine covid. need choose one many people gross getting sick. feels optimistic. Taking vitamin K helps make sure absorb much vitamin D. much vitamin [most definitely also rare since people deficient take really really high dose every day. 

I still take vitamin D+K pill flaxseed oil capsules though. think I‚Äôm almost completely it. However, I‚Äôm wondering lingering brain fog/memory issues. It‚Äôs hard tell, since 2020 life crazy possible mind simply fatigued. 

Regardless, I‚Äôm thankful. healthy risk factors, couldn‚Äôt get it. breathing issues went on. Months months. Like walking one flight stairs made feel like going pass out. looked like hell. truly seemed permanent. There‚Äôs doubt never close sick entire life. got better, worse, better, worse. Fever 102-104 *weeks*. 

Then sail right through. quite random. saying gains people getting poverty last decades? weaknesses American brand rugged individualism exposed, sure. still remain largely skeptical vitamin actually causing anything here, effects related vitamin deficiencies common elderly otherwise already sick patients would vulnerable Covid. 

That said, many locales people could probably benefit supplementation anyways cost fairly low risk harm likely even lower, go ahead take supplement. Lord. DeSantis definitely contributed epic moron. Yep. That‚Äôs said. CCP level lockdown want rights taken away. Give break. governor main reason Schools enforcing dress codes since schools began. happen companies make market vaccine people discover they‚Äôve harmed product hastily brought market? According law passed spring, pretty much literally longest amount time people lived isolation modern US history. Living alone thing post-war metropolitan booms. Ask governor? mean healthcare workers take proper precautions? one truly exceptional leadership smart behavior /s..... really matter disease deadly. cases go stay down. Played lot. Question vaccines. go Walgreens get flu vaccine every year. idea makes it. getting vaccine say, someone goes CVS? everyone US get vaccine different vaccines made different companies?

Asking hear many different vaccines made covid-19. US choose one distribute everybody like previous question get different one depending go? Ask Angelia Jolie adopt rich! R 1 fact good enough. shit scary. May ask, restrictions/safety guidelines, many outbreaks aware within  Makes instant celebrity take it. Oh no, get it. see awful lot people going way credit German company. Let's clear - America's saving world, again.

You're welcome. Oh I'm totally aware much Jazz Pharma rat fucking fellow narcoleptics lol. want get political sub (cause needing hyper-expensive drug function political stance, guess), GHB, add insane amount salt 'deter misuse' (stop drink spiking) instead add color bitter flavor. jacks BP, plus rolling new 'low sodium' formula time renew patent.

Good news Jazz soon. Hasn‚Äôt federal funding increased dramatically last decades? agree teachers deserve pay do, especially now, seems funding isn‚Äôt biggest issue. It‚Äôs administration said funds. 99.987 survival rate gonna hook Jake state farm getting Rogers rate I‚Äôm fat guy. Last thing want part eating contest. Ugh. :) Ah, well, then, getting line side effect fallout happens. nobody died opinion flawed logic.

Nobody tell odds exposed twice given time frame many variables. Nobody tell many people exposed either reason. said, surely significant portion people, healthcare workers, exposed regularly STILL seeing get reinfected meaningfully quantifiable rate. reinfection among general populace would really matter cases would end hospitalization, would get tested.

So, lack documented cases even among people know exposed constantly evidence persisting antibodies least 6-8 months. really wish people would leave covid conjecture people least somewhat educated medical knowledge. Unnecessary pessimism fearmongering make situations worse. Covid vaccine left building Listen guys ok kill adults kids. Sounds like dementia. Forgetting current events, Reagan still president .... nobody's fault cept China... exact situation obviously going happen people send kids school around hundreds thousands kids? (who live tons people may gods know what?) mean shame you, something figure would happen? it? doesn‚Äôt get approved? what? Let's roll red carpet open bottle champagne! Trump wants credit vaccine lol Hospitals 120% yet school still requiring us attend in-person faculty meetings. schools start ACTUALLY following science, we'll keep spreading virus.   would call non-emergency police line. God damn.  though? Death year. ...for rich governments. transitioned mass testing.

Transitioning now. CDC says unnecessary overkill; see mass testing Shanghai recent cases.  Obviously great, least cases going down, up. good enough. absolute bullshit. Small k factor HUGE R0. might one infectious viruses there. Thank God short infectivity window. Funny say anything meat packing plants. Alright I'll say preschool level understand. inevitable deaths, PREVENTABLE ones. something stop people dying not, fault there, least partially. 

Want say slowly puppets?  feel really bad guy even live near specific grocery store planning go (Trader Joe's, can't get items elsewhere) let pay back. hope friends live alone get stuck quarantine time soon, I'll definitely pay forward do. Link up, putin xi also wondering Keeping mind schools open many people still going work, also many quite strictly following rules - pretty good I'd say. Playing devil's advocate here. everybody thinks government big corporations best intentions. fair assessment make. necessary jump conclusion say somebody anti vaxxer, perhaps want little bit liability attached stuff they're pumping bodies. see anyone say schools=yes, dining out, social gatherings =no. 

What school beyond one great big social gathering? twice day, children take masks breakfast lunch closely resembles extremely crowded restaurant. lot people fucked pandemic. hope lose sight much China blame this. need clean shit. many things originate can't clean act Well 95% false positives so..... thought Mylan producing Advil Pfizer Pfizer split? images sunbathing shedevils nude question is, much longer safety nets? Schools, daycares workplaces can‚Äôt keep shutting forever. wanted R0 analysis... realized didn'y know got worried....

5 million actives cases... 1-2% americans actives case.... 10 mil travelors... 1-2% infected= half infect least 1..... vague guess exactly think pays AAP's paychecks? I'll give heads up. parents kids.  Let put way: building 30 years old, first week school air conditioner working all...and changed filters started working. a/c guy showed filter inches shit built it, stopped working. 

But window opens 3 inches calling sufficient. get it. world Dr. Fauci recommending schools stay open? child gets Coronavirus school takes home, grandparents could die. many kids asymptomatic one knows spreading virus. put situation damage?? Italy 20-30k new cases per day much testing whole country state NY doing.
It‚Äôs bad Europe. living might looking DNR. switch vote? want end line experiment. I'm taking 8,000IU 12,000IU. Watched many videos that. Doctors say safe take amount. 150,000 starting toxic. Taking 100% needed magnesium well. Last months cannot get sick all. covid symptoms disappeared days tested negative well. Yep, long aren‚Äôt soiled, disintegrated stayed dry you‚Äôre good go mean, children watch teachers get sick die also lot basis social psychology well. expected. comes vaccine right election. Barbaric :( Stay safe, compadre. *Laughs European* Or, gotta cover ""nussy"" Ok sure make sense. Thanks links!

P.S. phone originally made links minks. would hilarious autocorrect, given circumstances. guys transporting wear mop top hairdos lost dad Tuesday, 65. let stepmom go kids say goodbye via FaceTime, quarantine around them. alone isolated horrific event made much worse still doesn‚Äôt feel real yet.

Some wise reasonable, skeptical reckless others reprehensible outright callous. isn‚Äôt least bit surprising amount unrest veil pulled back revealing absolute circus. pay taxes people... Wow, overreact much? 

No gave opinion. Sorry like number include retired people? so, good quote.

No include retired people would it? Also go Bureau Labor Statistics (The source quoted) look yourself, maybe provide counter evidence since took issue anecdotes. mean research post, hence something quote. bet could totally find supporting evidence yourself, instead tried poke holes without even google search. Disappointing. data great, except usually truly representative statistics.

Your ""evidence"" thus far raising children. believe anecdote quite literally presented statistics threw I'm argue you. 

You absolutely else responded have. absurd. 

I'm sorry kids bit. lot whiplash, accused reacting. asserting provide statistic provide point trying claim evidence argument wanna anecdotal giving anecdotes. 

Your whole air attitude exactly posted did. Check bit, person younger opinion oppositional without intrinsically wrong matter many children raised. sprinkle much positivity youth turd presented shit none less. 

Finally quote last clear, saying group badly older people ""had much harder."" 

No absolutely say feel many us, even made less intelligent decisions youth, would make smarter ones many youth today are. 

And quite simply, disagree. reaction here, opinion little much time hands pandemic Fur lot affordeable days, especially smaller piece jacket etc. see people wearing literally time go out, rich poor regions. That's...really high. makes sense considering insane population density Indian cities. relatively low death toll makes sense considering population super young obesity rates low. It‚Äôs common sense healthcare workers actively combating virus priority others. fall high risk fatality virus, essential workers would third everyone else particular order. It‚Äôs heartless it‚Äôs best course action keep everyone safe. may first get you‚Äôll still ahead majority population. Never happier LGBT come religious family. Haven‚Äôt seen forever lol guess I‚Äôm elite cause instead sit traffic two hours sit front computer open laptop get work morning. wish could essential work instead pays bills let‚Äôs play dog work teams 52 players. Still enough play. 
- Steelers fan Hopefully curve starting flatten, another couple weeks give enough buffer mitigate it? Kinda sorta - allowances stuff practical work, example university still meet person 12 hours week. mixed, practice. Indefinitely? Probably not. enough time herd immunity? Definitely. article states immunity lasts long fucking time. way, vaccine immunity almost universally lasts less time immunity natural recovery.  isn‚Äôt debate opening closing schools. It‚Äôs saying ‚Äúmy friends fine homeschool everyone else fine XD‚Äù. Stop trying invalidate issues online school maybe little empathetic :)

And would bet money kids abused family members don‚Äôt proper meals eat, less 150 minors died COVID. Kinda? gave benefit doubt country people fucking idiots reap sow.

No empathy absolute idiots failed every turn.

Those protect themesleves love good books. published replicated evidence raw data, efficacy safety scam written it.

So Much MONEY. number times said ""and day that"" brings us Dec 15! work industry that‚Äôs much case countries understanding ended convincing family palliative care 78yo. Oh well. don‚Äôt sympathy people buy expensive cars can‚Äôt afford. drive fleet beaters fix two hands walk bike  still late pay people certain reptilian senator would call senate back work legislation. imagine gets fucking wasted time off. can‚Äôt even imagine job. medical professional who‚Äôs hated half nation begging safe worst pandemic lifetimes. Many even think it‚Äôs hoax. I‚Äôd lose fucking shit public point. Thank you! Yeah, worked well past... High Plains. There's really many hospitals take patients us anymore hotspot working way. sent patients El Paso, OKC, Dallas, Lubbock. take much themselves. 

The patient DNR palliative care still treat them. think ended happening doctor called change palliative morning. couple weeks I've many deaths since then. live northeast Ohio quiet low crime city, pay 575 plus utilities 2 bedrooms, locked garage keypad, central air laundry hookups. US already touching 200,000 cases/day? projections? science would back this? heard talk ten day quarantine, nothing got idea. Honestly something inside changed dramatically. sheer ignorance I've witnessed virtually person something brain struggles with. people selfish dumb ignorant? three? Idk, lost train thought. definitely feel different towards people now.  medic junk science:

for instance; ""the placebo""? Yeah, cause US... again, 80% Americans unhealthy fuck. That's bodies working right messed genes (which I'm sure happens), shove gullets.

The answer getting adequate Magnesium eating healthy balanced diet, vegetables, legumes, seeds whole grains. taking supplement vitamin naturally get sunlight absorbs properly.

Supplements meant name implies, supplement lack diet. Magnesium novel get protein. fault Americans willfully ignorant basic health education. honestly even bother positivity subreddit. soon celebrity athlete politician *anyone* notoriety gets vaccine, see people complaining nonstop vaccine favoritism. know what'll happen big actor, athlete, politician says *won't* take vaccine available general population? see people accusing fueling dangerous conspiracy theories.

This entire subreddit disgusting melting pot pessimism whining way makes sense read imagine every single comment worst possible way headline could interpreted, that's is. There's almost room positivity, nuance, even discussion. crab bucket whining can't wait irrelevant. interacting daily strangers. OK.

Visiting family. Coronavirus spike. nurse friend stories horrifying. said never used see deaths it‚Äôs pretty much daily. She‚Äôs gotten covid twice now, first time got quarantine home, time she‚Äôs forced work since hospital overrun symptoms aren‚Äôt severe. Welcome darkest year adventures. still quarantine, however testing mandatory arriving overseas. I'm surprised testing compulsory. 

I live Texas kids schools opened person October. 2 months campus maybe total 3 weeks quarantines rotations due lack staff. 

Honestly, reason opened campuses first place could play high school football. it‚Äôs one seems care. 12 million lose unemployment benefits day Christmas knowing that‚Äôs coming, people spend year. Congress needs something already hard enough convince people wear masks social distance, Vaccinated exempt things job impossible. tendency form calcifications need careful. people shit show, period. Ignorant, Selfish &amp; entitled: native new yorker. People shit show global warming too: care buck &amp; costs environment. Young people expect government act like good parent. Politics popularity contest holds promise real leadership. gonna learn govern resources wisely finally. ever tried post Tik Tok? lol

Also, reason, I'm sinking suspicion DEAD would drastically affects learning too. Honestly lot sounds like fibromyalgia one theories fibro begins body suffers trauma like surgery illness. seriously, symptoms exact brain fog, joint pain, gastro issues extreme tiredness. small chance might caught friend I‚Äôm kind pissed I‚Äôve isolated careful passed 7months. I‚Äôm Bay Area Calif pretty active . didn‚Äôt even visit family Thanksgiving haven‚Äôt seen since 2019. WFH stay isolated. lives block. don‚Äôt even go unless groceries always wear mask. He‚Äôs really person hang person cause keeps us sane.

Nick Sabin Absolutely agreed. hope people willing take small risk vaccination know..save world Thanksgiving deadlier, people die four weeks can't die Christmas. think makes much sense outside moral ideals come it. insanely unlikely normal person age forty die this. read numbers CDC's website yourself, find vaccinating someone 65 five times likely prevent death someone 65. everyone 65 vaccinated, deaths would 80%.

Maybe comes different views what's important here, think makes much sense give vaccine healthy teenager grocery store almost definitely even show symptoms virus rather ninety year old nursing home physical capacity essential worker, much less able fight virus. sounds ridiculous me. Even moreso overseas. According latest ABS statistics, 26.3% arrivals citizens PRs, Australia opening borders international students leaving tens thousands abandoned overseas. California actually pretty well (by US standards).

Even World. California bad. wrong idea someone recovers somehow immune hope not. really need groups take vaccine it‚Äôs available them.

Not according America. $$$$$$$$$$$$ thing matters. America country money, life means nothing. Say millions kids who've homeschooled ended going awesome colleges. Several friends included that. Millions risking lives entire pandemic. they're told they're safe enough work, could explain they're safe enough hangout work equally exposed co-workers? gets really depressing really quickly hearing deadly virus working close proximity public. Sweden would go current 30 deaths per day 21 lockdown. Sweden destroyed citizen's lives this?

 that's assuming study anywhere close accurate. lockdown delays cases, stop altogether. Submission statement: submitted OC 11/29/20 sake comments review criticism.

And wear damn mask. Lol Reality care narratives. numbers posted fake. There's reason ignorance bliss. wrong always going people bigger burden normal. Last year father passed away long battle cancer, can‚Äôt imagine hard would happened year current covid restrictions. 

This year niece born, mothers grandchild. Parents mom trying safe (she one visit far, states numbers pretty low). Despite this, mom upset ‚Äúthey stay small long‚Äù ‚Äî wrong, missing normal family visit.

The problem money, education system itself, mainly politicization, core issue. amount money help system actively rejects education favor political indoctrination creation misconstuable data campaign purposes.

Not pedantic, lack evidence equivalent confirmation fact. 

We know 95% cases transmitted. ones confirm overwhelmingly indoors contact tracing way easier indoor locations. People remember going work, remember walking random guy coughed sidewalk 5 days ago.

It could well outdoor transmission fairly common, lack ability collect evidence proving so. could rare, know. 

Generally better err side caution. could go live somewhere else different county? mean would hard unless you‚Äôre quite well financially, impossible. bet professional athletes.

Really? Tell more, mind! calculation based idea social contacts except schools shops stopped lockdown, accurate, there's still million things going (hospitals operating, nursing homes operating,...). calculation? worse failures prevented even local athorities mask mandates restrictions would reduced spread.

they actively prevented harm reduction. Really likely americans reason upvoting canadian news rather canadians site upvoting it? 1/10th Reddit lot users. currently 406 upvotes, think there's even slightest possibility we're Canadians?

Do countries actually exist outside USA? go bed, countries seize exist? wake up, everything starts anew? Everyone's life entirely dependent country? Every article every website USA weirdly upvoting non-USA things even though normally wouldn't? USA much internet's popular websites? 

Is Canada even real? It‚Äôs illegal close state borders. Can‚Äôt blockade roads. would relying someone looks like make judgement them. cases generally called racism.

**Florida Governor Extends Ban Enforcing Mask pandemic started US? Well considering it‚Äôs illegal close state lines... second, it‚Äôs SHERIFF departments refuse enforce anything Newsom attempted. Newsom tried, local officials refuse enforce comply, there‚Äôs point. Newsom fault all. straight misinformation. Spring 2021 little optimistic.

It takes vaccinate enough people. guess autumn 2021 Thankfully able recover seemed rough hell.  Closing bars work. Several bars around restaurant, indeed large Texas metro area, refiled restaurant order reopen. 

We need shut public venues give stimulus money INDIVIDUALS survive time needed stay closed. love Anchorage, Alaska basicly happening here. three hospitals town last days often taking patients hospitals, taking almost n one emergency room unless basicly flatline. smaller cities usually send us patients smaller hospitals fill can't many places even local hospitals send everything serious here. normally would sent cases Seattle keep beds staff available thanks surge downnthere arent allow us right now. date really matter. find bills programs tack onto negotiations benifit order agree anything. Places near China took seriously ok.

People clamoring restrictions old people vaccinated becomes less deadly flu look like psychos They're bit exception... though bet populous towns problem.

To reframe things, harder vaccinate population less likely get COVID. It‚Äôs Stupidity. Pretty easy. Except older generations deal 

The great depression 
Two world wars
Vietnam

And talked things LOT political.

""I actually go whole day without mentioning political BS""

Like what? bet prove conversations hobbies either push re-enforce political views.

Example, talk movies, TV shows media? Guess what, we're political least shaped politics creators/shareholders Fun fact - it‚Äôs even US government biggest expenditure. even second. 

Also, no, probably couldn‚Äôt fixed climate change money.

But, would know it? aren‚Äôt even US. clearly think military stands around sternly guns kills. wonder many people know Ed Sullivan even LOL! going funeral going help grieve, mental health, help way? so, yes would probably go. going feel it‚Äôs duty go, worried family members think absence?

Some may say it‚Äôs duty go. depends household members risk factors. go, assume infected.

For funeral wouldn‚Äôt necessary process grieving, high risk. wouldn‚Äôt go. answer may different though. make best decisions based unique situations. Good luck!

Edit: grammar Americans DEAD right covid.

You know deaths SARS-CoV-2 system counted deaths COVID-19? in, virus body, completely asymptomatic, die completely unrelated reason still counted death result COVID. I'm telling you, overblown

Small businesses crushed need constant footfall able survive commercial basis. they're forced shut down, businesses die. Humans better surving warmer tempertures colder

You can't compare strength human civilisation source gives fuck? Plenty western countries hard lockdowns, way late failed contact reading remaining cases got second wave. pure incompetence nothing authoritarianism. tried find numbers Moderna vaccine. said something 20 million doses 2020 months ago give estimate recent weeks. Even 2021 behind bigger players although gotta give credit, first vaccine manufactured lab lost race Biontech/Pfizer government demanded increase minority proportion trial.

March/April 2021 looks like turning point available everyone. sick kids. poster half right, parents send kids school sick, large number parents use sick leave kids sick.  guy article supposed do? Suffer? According subreddit, yes. known better get honest answers snake pit like this. Nine months you(and we)-can-decide-to-stop-it-now. 49 weeks yet, week US lets number plane crash flu, can't anything pilot sneezes. Also 90 young people planes die buildings destroyed week.

And cause: old people, life worth nothing? Sorry know ""Lebensunwertes Leben"" German history books. fail find difference say something like that. Take vitamin D, use Ibuprofen that. lot nurses, doctors essential workes kids. close schools makes harder them. Quebec, last year high school students remote learning (only regions spikes cases), stay alone home day. makes perfect sense developmental perspective. closed business subsidized till open again. can't subsidize 6 year old's brain.

Other things close first ideally. Without federal money there's good choices though think it‚Äôs important beer bar children get education? Maybe need go back school Ah, I‚Äôve stayed hotel honeymoon. Everything else air bnb insanely cheap comparison.  Ah yes. know Trump supports supporting CCP. would they? Pfizer huge multinational. could either:

Just pay UPS/FedEx/airline exactly want zero red tape like usually do.for sending around life-saving medicine.

Or arrange whole new transportation distribution pipeline good reason organization known red tape.

The military might make sense country worse logistics infrastructure, much here... Military logistics good waem fuzzy people like hear government things. are, got phone call afternoon. Asides husband work week haven‚Äôt anywhere. 

I‚Äôm wondering tests negative get tested still?  Well appear vast majority people recover without issue. Oxford vaccine, well according article isn‚Äôt safe all. Idk grandpa couldn‚Äôt talk war, Great Depression, without drinking Work home. Buy bench weights plane load whole vaccine available. would suck lose it, really cataphoric effort whole. Lol overestimate capacity America anything requires political effort today Ah man, think amphetamines sitting spot!

 customs airport? Thats read real science. virus first explode might point origin. textbook science. cost? think safe benefit cost, knowing get disease knowing business reopen real big cost tho So, yesterday mother's husband diagnosed Covid-19.

Edit: Forgot clarify, early 30's, I'm 17 turning 18 soon. Completely agree. highly reputable reliable scientific tests reviews terms efficacy reducing COVID-19 transmission variety masks available public. variety types masks reviewed different situations, objective ratings would great. would think worldwide touting encouragement widespread mask wearing, would done public knowledge point (nearly year since outbreak). apologies Adam Levine, it‚Äôs WINTER that‚Äôs gonna hurt like motherfucker.

Dude, one wants lock down. Lock downs inevitable mouth breathers don‚Äôt wear masks don‚Äôt voluntarily practice basic social distancing. Hospitals fill up, hand forced strict harder lockdowns. 

This going bad winter people would rather go back normal inconvenienced all. It‚Äôs going hard lesson lot people unfortunately. 

If city/state/county ends locking one blame neighbors living denial didn‚Äôt take recommended precautions seriously enough. Cops last tho spanish flu took like 20 years get vaccine. Yes, 4-5 months horizon. that's horizon viewing life way short term So, imagine responsible spreading covid one friends getting killed. Worth it?  honestly would expected organised online BOOS Fauci's recommendation keep schools open.

Guess yet another agenda circlejirk subreddit? contain it? Let spill schools churches. Let bodies pile streets. Everything improves Trump's second term üí© writer ate could gotten eating food prepared someone infected. nephew got healthcare worker exposed asymptomatic wearing masks around 10 min max. precautions reduce transmissions. Yeah mean... they‚Äôre called anti-vaxxers. lot cases, actual evictions lease renewals. Check rights right now. ? Every country committed buying doses trials finished. That's orders worked. super spreaders clearly ones think it‚Äôs hoax ones also antivaxers ""sensationalized,"" characterized serious is, big deal, suggest take time volunteer local hospital. might clue in. huge blindspot knowing going hospitals. bureaucratic bullshit doctors nurses threatened careers even give one peak behind curtain. 

If shit kept secret maybe we'd fighting chance. hell no. reason people care much everything shit-show global scale. make vaccines boring again. learn history doomed repeat first time comment comments longer total 666. would bet last dollar spreading like wildfire vast vast vast majority cases mild asymptomatic. true. great room mate otherwise think late; concern gone different direction. understand everyone reacts deals differently mindful living space well. 

Thank input! felt good get mind Drop waaayy back, twice week. find site favorite hobby, go right afterwards. helps. We're past highest # cases curve headed up--and times plenty rough inside hospitals aware of, plenty rough tens thousands died. hope recovered I'm glad her. &lt;3 Hopefully happens sooner rather later. I‚Äôm class Chinese students. It‚Äôs grad level course refuse put camera even though professor asks too. One group refused work group project threw fit like child turned work without name. culture theft dishonesty there. think keeping schools open contries full blown outbrakes highly irresponsible; especially vaccine yet disseminated entire population. online, possible, not.

I'll take step back shudder above, would felt inconcievable sentence one year ago. Yet today, find literally criminal schools kept open, expense teachers children's parents... **not** conscripted disposable military teens. No, saying equivalent say *mandating* use condoms proven effective, condoms uselhets. Ravens 20 players COVID-19/Reserve list NFL still wants play Tuesday.

They plans playoffs either. spun around show covid 19 fake?? cried, I'm tearful person. Neither boyfriend contact family friends since February. gone eat. gone anywhere could considered entertainment, even non-essential. carefully planned essential doctors/dentists appointments grocery needs leave house every 10-12 days. boyfriend conditions make quite high-risk, I'm going put danger selfish reasons. ground every day rest country's inability same. extreme introvert breaking point. go months yet. 

Also, unemployed year, job hunt going well February boyfriend suggested stop looking going increase exposure way. I've way much time hands, contributing depression. Reading, hobbies, binging tv, things take far. meant function like this. None take pandemic seriously unless get sick 

Bold assume they'll take seriously afterwards Exactly Thank much. wish best also. =) Yeah people mobbing PS5 definitely safe distanced. Yup. hell person's gloves? UK?

On hand, follow Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, South Korea, China, various african countries like Rwanda?

Even India alright number per capita...for least. It‚Äôs money savings ever. There‚Äôs ton people ready move up. Tegnell's messaging bad regarding tracing masks, blame hearing it. makes idiotic statements TTI, asymptomatic spreaders benefits masks international press, going doubt using base strategy. atleast accepted past mistakes, certainly slow many things. currently able trace, great. 

Still statement lockdowns postpone infections still false. Lockdowns drop infection rates levels tracing possible, reducing future infections well. purpose lockdowns get uncontrolled spread controlled. Also even would postpone, treatments improve vaccines get distributed, deaths get prevented eather way. Virus downplayers never admit this. reason harms COVID seem higher containing worst COVID, would otherwise much worse everything. doesn‚Äôt matter government could make legal not. That‚Äôs guys don‚Äôt get can‚Äôt make crazy law everyone complies. I‚Äôm even sure epidemiologists recommending things get that. Hopefully they‚Äôve consulted appropriate fields study. public snap you‚Äôd insurrection, military police refuse citing constitution. 

I don‚Äôt know would come first, would happen, probably both. 

Also it‚Äôs completely ignoring ethics favor what, stop virus begin, mandatory NPI must rest foundation public health science, coordination, cooperation, law Second, interventions quarantine school closures must meet harm principle conform international ethical principles require ‚Äúcoercive public health measures legitimate, legal, necessary, non-discriminatory represent least restrictive means appropriate reasonable achievement public health Finally, principles reciprocity, transparency, nondiscrimination, accountability‚Äîas well right due process challenge mandatory NPI‚Äîmust One greatest challenges policymakers accurately determine pandemic unfolding real time whether NPI meet principle proportionality‚Äîthat restrictions individual liberties incurred NPI exceed needed respond community‚Äôs assessed risk.

Indeed, 1918 experience suggests public health departments longer track records community involvement compliance, clear delegation roles responsibilities, fared better. issues, related agency flow charts community buy-in, pressing ever given various layers public health would involved response major pandemic United States around world. Excellent organization local level stymied friction county, state, federal entities, mention private, international, commercial actors.

Yeah.... people live die based leadership follow. people lost causes point. small window March could changed outcome right words leadership dead gone.

 Without laws mandates pro virus crowd continue spread like missionaries. Pfizer large manufacturing plant Puurs (Belgium), 20 miles north Brussels. Fun fact: Puurs also hometown Duvel beer. long pause. Vic element fucked intakes. Flight caps dependence hotels, inadequate staffing sure many many more. think media played role, continued 'other' Australians calling travellers something b\*tch 7sunrise making fun Australians overseas (I think salty, since mother's funeral livestream screenshots leaked due relatives able fly here)

They also allowed least 60+ international students Australia's fifth largest industry (education) shit got ""think economy"" still thousands stranded Aussies.

I've hotel quarantines months RC recommendations (mix actual quarantine facility home option) RC recommendations come sooner earlier. people already spend $1200 given last March ? budgeted better guess. makes sound like anti-vaxxer making fun people espouse ""so called virtues vaccination"". sister anti-vaxx. would call vaccine truther. virus downplayers complaining proved BS delayed fixing problem they're mathematically incompetant jerks selfish narcissists. Compared normal vaccine, were. funding, side effects may manifest long time. detect them, would need longer trials - throwing money enough. know mean. would love meet friends socially distantly masks. However, live parents dad high risk category don‚Äôt want take chances exposure whatsoever, won‚Äôt allow see friends. understand wanting careful. wish things different. people previously thought Covid19 infection, mean virus less lethal (less dangerous) previously thought?

I ready already throw face mask away Healthcare workers first, vulnerable patients second. essential workers? Followd rest population age. course, memory B cells play. need measure whether person actual sick (re-infected) seems typically go due research cost.

And similar viruses limiting SARS MERS. coronaviruses exhibit possibility re-infection within year.  time starts flatten it'll Christmas. wife works covid icu hospital wide 100 percent capacity well Thanksgiving.


 writing ignorance cause death people's toe tags. 3 year old baby. We‚Äôre alright, we‚Äôve able avoid RSV diseases riskier babies we‚Äôve lockdown. hasn‚Äôt bad us. worry 3 year old getting enough social interaction kids, that‚Äôs big priority us staying healthy.  No, works, exponential function. R0 somewhere around 0.9 moment. 0.9 attributed different settings. 

And three four factors consider: 

- school
- work
- supermarkets
- illegal gatherings

Experts saying see schools significant vector. course government going illegal gatherings day long... sound like me. Fuck US government recognizing this. Citizens, family members spouses still go Australia know. Friday three days ago. case spike supposed happening?

Cases based around events run 7-10 days, generally. take account blotchy reporting holiday season catch up, though. 

Then again, post seems like lot personal issue so: I'll leave it. leaked videos rumors point. remember seeing video black tagging someone's family member hospital level disaster triage hoping god fake. became familiar news Italy got going. :( little research woman curiosity. appears mid late 30s maybe even early 40s kids. fucking stupid must one throwaway career?

Like literally good 30 years left career thought comedian could mock co-workers patients. way go life. Oh course forgotten due HR staff able Google name employers, really fucked herself. Oh believe know. close friends get anything still ""employed"" severely reduced hours etc. bill blanket treatment missed needed gave lot people didn't. know people work we're looking got essentially free money. people got bill, ran can't pay rent. people get bill fortunate enough fired. worked making less people sitting home. factor 600 Northeast wayyyy less 600 Alabama. people legitimately screwed beaten made like bandits Well said man! Thanks service. looked comments, wanted people get sick black friday?

what hate day much, even posted r/blackfriday before, unironically seems.  Covid vaccines rushed. fully funded immediately. went hoops. good news? Apart schools essentials, strict lockdown. socialising, restaurants open, sports, clothes shops, work home etc. got cases 30%. 

Short closing schools, measures left. barely managed reduce cases. real question waited decide? They've 8 months figure out! big recall one brand aware private life none business. wow first time i‚Äôve heard anyone refer bodily autonomy evil... fuckin bananas bro

and yall calling us crazy! lol drives it‚Äôs 15min journey, what‚Äôs stopping get caught that‚Äôs ¬£1000 fine I‚Äôm financially stable pay that, what‚Äôs stopping unable understand rules properly even try get explained lol, haven‚Äôt thought could use excuse , ‚Äú living eachother she‚Äôs picked work ‚Äú excuse? time isnt subset reality, reality. people know react duress, happens many pressure time see true colors coming out. might kept going along never saw side them, always there, continue ""all over"". 

This real life, side quest people treated accordingly. ones shined, hold closer, ones didn't, treat accordingly. 1. lateral flow reliable PCR, PCR used lateral flow faster?
2. eligible testing Liverpool, many attended? self-selecting - effectively, cautious people (those isolate anyway), possibly older age groups, without symptoms? 
3. extent PCR case numbers declined time lateral flow testing carried out?
4. results mass testing Slovakia effective reducing case numbers consistent number previously identified cases country - captured majority population. medic junk instance; ""the placebo""?

Are idiot? know placebo is? considered demographic confounders though? 

I‚Äôm pretty confident NY people would seek testing SD average. (That‚Äôs hunch think pretty good one) **YOUR DOCTOR** know it‚Äôs bad cases doubled past month. Right. thinking could field hospitals set less severe cases shunted to, rather training new people (although would level that, too, suppose) wondering military docs/nurses/medics could deployed handle initial overflow. maybe they're already deal similar situation wherever they're currently based available either? get here? 
A shitstain governor. 
A lockdown started ended month. 
No mask mandate. 
Restaurants, bars, clubs, churches, stores general public simply act like doesnt exist. 
Again poor leadership top down. 

Vote DeSantis. neither bigger country bigger economy, already weak start.

They spend much larger portion budget defense much lesser results. want reiterate shit wages benefits. Also less capable force.

And military performed well places. like Vietnam, don‚Äôt confuse military success political/media/culture clusterfuck. Also, don‚Äôt know actual end game was. expensive, outside told, really failures? It‚Äôs immense project started, takes lot finish. 

And concept bloated military discredited fallout cuts pander line thinking. Yes, lot *because end day much more.* one else deter China, Russia, handle Middle East like can. 

B-but guys shouldn‚Äôt handling it, say. 

You get say are. ‚Äúfreedom isn‚Äôt free‚Äù tired line kind way. China literally raping seas neighbors resources imprisoning killing foreign civilians fishing international waters. Russia constantly resource grip western Eastern Europe presence stops abusing. 

Etc. etc. 

And 50% line. *literally* got oil dependence years ago. don‚Äôt need Middle East oil like used to. don‚Äôt let happen Iranian hostage whole region false control Suez claim. danish tho.

ah thank you!   
that gets direct results english searches stopping so? presume rules - risk getting actually caught? think police chance tracking every single person. far girlfriend? movement limited? pretend move approved exception asked? Ah, self medication. friend took pills anxiety. One day took two pills instead one extra anxious. mentioned it, doctor said taken one more, would dead. Apparently pills lower heart rate something. happening Wuhan January/February scared shit me.

No doubt. really watched video using large drones disinfectant, mention disinfectant cannons. knew shit getting real point. already happening - Ticketmaster looking APIs providers health data ticketing systems.

It's going real shit show precedent set, due mix greed trust platforms security. may asymptomatic, gleefully spreading ignorant germs others lucky. might work lower level care, ICU beds staff tapped out, that's that. level care great effectively fit field hospital train new staff level quickly. Lol either state colleges live. fact, covid, online classes universities always *more* expensive, despite requiring almost work teachers would replay video content recorded 6 years ago class. extra $300 *per credit* (on top thousands already paying class) part ""distance learning fee,"" whatever means. American universities suck literally care money. university work still charging hundreds dollars parking passes (which employees pay well unless want walk 30-60+ minutes work every day), even though classes online people even campus ones work keep running. You‚Äôre great job morgues filling up. It‚Äôs true. need 11 guys stop admiring Australia every thread? eradicated virus, yes, cost stranding thousands people abroad completely shitting life anyone needs cross border. basically said - hehe, island, let's abuse that! Oh, responsibility citizens? Screw that!

I understand hard people never left county, people lovelihoods, famillies things can't even think depends ability cross borders. ""their fault"", used perfectly legal nobody told thwy going lock year possibly several. absolute disaster nobody cares becUse ""hooray, beat virus!"". Nope. Everyone keeps repeating true. Countries handled well May normal Christmas.

My brother London believe BS, following rules - like last lockdown. gets upset wedding next August cancelled year.

No one side planet flying Europe America people like this. Good. 99.997% survival based CDC IFR 0-19 .00003 rate. 

And needless harm child development. Open now. 

I know everyone‚Äôs going saw teachers, well that‚Äôs essential job I‚Äôve ever seen one. don‚Äôt like it, quit move area virtual learning. vast majority 99.98%/.0002 20-49 IFR range. 

Believe teachers quit area hated online learning much. won‚Äôt find news. 

All CDC IFR numbers sourced here: What's point? grew rural area--if wanted play friends, ride bicycle hour get closest one's house. 

It fucking sucked. What's truly sad true one biggest superpower World arguably worst outbreak seemingly fuck-all it.

Sure, Pfizer created vaccine they're private fuck-you company people meant afford shot guaranteed hundreds thousands it'll cost?

They're bring UK estimated $600 million.

Yet again, see private companies ripping ass normal people profits, except time fucking pandemic. Europe US isolated island. Try google img search. danish Anyone provide comfort care dying may still needed even there's ICU staff left. üòï He's spot driven family gatherings pandemic setting thus super spreder events. expect echo chamber methods CCP? supporting ridiculous lockdown measures would probably happy transform democracies gulag. Black Friday three days ago. case spike supposed happening?

Also, shopping relatively low risk activity: done mask (or be); need extent (yes, shop online), we're exposed person close distance long period time viral transmission low, terms number transmissions amount virus transmitted, people stay local area similar prevalence cases.

That's absolutely different maskless, indoors enclosed space large numbers close family prolonged period, probably hugging certainly well within six feet. Yeah did, got headlines already. conservatives gonna see FB feed sad thing cases flattened week Thanksgiving, means may well days hospital admissions slow ...before picking right back Thanksgiving surge hits. üòï live recommended take vitamin winter anyways. might well take them. different doses. got mine blood test doctor. protects can't take medical reasons vaccine take. interesting thing Liverpool supposed hottest place infection wasnt hotbed.

Problem is, government claim lockdowns even true, built deniability biggest thing I‚Äôve learned pandemic many selfish stupid people America. Fuck off, say.

Some people limited time left earth would rather spend loved ones risk getting covid spend last months alone.

Sure, people isolate do, can't pause entire planet. Nsw taking bulk taking daily others states take weekly (wouldn't surprised nsw taken 60%of total last 6 months) . Vic taking decent numbers mishandling blame putting pause sorted out. stricter plan place start help get figures It‚Äôll bloodbath Christmas shopping, infection numbers rise, Queen mention covid Christmas speech, there‚Äôll another massive increase New Year‚Äôs Eve we‚Äôll lockdown end January Fritjof Capra. Austrian physicist... wrote books. Web Life. Tao Physics. 
His brother made film called Mindwalk, based one books. 
David Bohm, another physicist, comes mind example someone u could look up. honestly seems OK. hope Sweden's predictions course pandemic continue accurate been. Yet day thousands New Yorkers buying homes Florida get well run New York area. Hmmm University/college closures US usually lab courses, physical work course cannot effectively replicated home. all, can't expect students raise livestock apartment, buy spectrum analyzer oscilloscope class, offering courses could prevent students graduating time, slew negative effects school. Yeah let brought people. probably affected lockdowns, happily go online play heroes. number kids fussy defiant never fell 70‚ÄØpercent. article literally says fell 36%.

ü§î Hey guys. I‚Äôm autistic get overwhelmed quite quickly this. I‚Äôm 20 work 60 hours week still live parents person calm girlfriend. anyway go able stay round days week isn‚Äôt possible? Thanks taking time :) ( U.K.) problem  Europe, including UK, see following:

1. Daily ‚Äúcases‚Äù sky-rocketed Europe Autumn arrived.
2. Daily deaths labelled ‚ÄúCOVID deaths‚Äù rose line ‚Äúcases‚Äù ‚Äì levels apparently higher Spring peak.
3. BUT: Total all-cause mortality reflect central thesis paper major problem PCR-testing.  distorting policy creating illusion serious pandemic fact not.

&amp;#x200B;

1. True. Although ""problem"" sense testing wrongly.
2. Daily COVID deaths UK less half spring peak.
3. Week 46, number deaths registered 18.4% five-year average (1,904 deaths 272 daily deaths higher). 2,466 deaths involved COVID-19, 2,170 recorded underlying cause death (88.0%). 

Let's take mortality numbers:

* 1,904 deaths 18.4% average weekly deaths, 10,347
* Excluding COVID, would therefore see 10,347 + 2,170 - 1,904 = 10,081 deaths.

Therefore, highly speculative say total mortality align COVID deaths. I'm physician public health specialist, work risk honestly see anything numbers looks remotely trackers, NHS triage data GP consultation data show numbers patients attending COVID like conditions returned background levels; yet positive test results continued rise time. strongly implies test results picking largely false positives.

This relies two assumptions:

1. Social distancing work suppress respiratory illnesses COVID-like symptoms lower R(t). words, reducing R(t) COVID, would expect other, less transmissible diseases significantly reduced eradicated.
2. People dying positive COVID test result positive COVID symptoms somehow false positives, despite presence disease greater mortality respiratory diseases would expected.

The authors scientific credentials conspiracy-minded woo. wrong it‚Äôs basically disinformation - plenty articles Swedish media lots speculation Sweden. Examples: 

‚ÄúThe rift grows - Tegnell lost veto‚Äù: government taken command‚Äù: government taken responsibility larger extent‚Äù: rift Tegnell L√∂fven‚Äù: rift Tegnell L√∂fven?‚Äù: rift Tegnell L√∂fven‚Äù: miss completely? You‚Äôd almost follow Swedish media all. claim conspiracy ‚ÄúEnglish language media‚Äù ‚Äúno internal contacts‚Äù making stuff blue? Everybody‚Äôs get Sweden reason?


It‚Äôs also cute many seem believe something denied politician bureaucrat, never existed. almost mechanical belief authorities. There‚Äôs herd immunity-strategy authorities denied it, there‚Äôs rift FHM Government authorities denied it.... 

I don‚Äôt think much insight Swedish bureaucracy pretend to. seems completely lost spectacularly controversial Tegnell openly contradicted undermined L√∂fvens message authority. college makes get tested 3x per week stay campus 1 x week live think gives balanced view it: says basically certain level spread good use resources cases traced. spread low (hasn't gone up, come back manageable level) useful. 

But even so: expression change whether ""Bother anything""? what's important what's actually done? N tracers per million Sweden count less N tracers per million France? water wet Different times.

At time america really ahead rest world. Dude There‚Äôs lot- hard find either giant check!!

Edited add: obviously read Ed McMahon...but really got giggling, I‚Äôm leaving it. getting right blood values. want really quickly one take high dose days. one time one take lower dose longer time. 

unfortunately standard dose way low due statistical error. role vitamin innate adaptive immunity critical. statistical error estimation recommended dietary allowance (RDA) vitamin recently discovered; correct analysis data used Institute Medicine, found 8895 IU/d needed 97.5% individuals achieve values ‚â•50 nmol/L. Another study confirmed 6201 IU/d needed achieve 75 nmol/L 9122 IU/d needed reach 100 massive individual variation comes dose response vitamin-d vitamin-d dose thats right everybody, may need little 1K IU may need 10K IU. recomendations really starting dose using blood values figure much particular individual needs. 


good chart demonstrating people could take 4,000 IU/day, measure vitamin levels one could recommended value 10 ng/ml (25 nmol/L), another could way ‚Äì 120 ng/ml (300 nmol/L) ‚Äì 10-fold variation response supplementation dose 4,000 IU/day. measuring vitamin blood serum levels, supplementation response varies greatly person-to-person.

Most world combine capitalism social healthcare. Average people‚Äôs opinions mostly don‚Äôt matter. Employers‚Äô do.

You may want go back office, may want leave house socialize, baby, 2021 going right back old normal. can't wait. think Spring Breakers ideas social distancing were...ah...lax, best. remember reading transmission within households. 

One easy example - daughter still goes school lockdown. catches Covid school, there's 1 school-based transmission. chances she'll pass husband &amp; I. There's two household transmissions. shops school involved Hubby &amp; I, still catch it.

You're also ignoring workplace transmission. capitalism needs end.  disgusting. true. sad humanity. link scientific literature explains cells produce antibodies? Divorce! forget medical professionals laid off. (Generally cosmetic surgeons like, still) 1) Complete lack external structure. nothing else going lives, life happening screen. easy get detached.

2) Lack support classmates. includes emotional support support classroom organization. Many students tough time keeping track assignments relied students reminding them, clarifying things (e.g. ""this we're supposed submit HW,"" ""did start problem set yet?"" etc...).

3) General depression. Combined stuff above, especially number 1, students simply checking out. depressed hard get go life smacking face. lived screen, even seem like reality.

4) Bad course organization/structure. little notice, hard instructors put together new curricula translating screen.

5) Real courses taught online. lot online classes are, like said, easier made easier. Professors though. Taking difficult course requires 10-20 hours/week outside work extremely challenging environment. guys life??? Turning covid sniffles effectively ending pandemic.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think end ""Contagion"" saw article. ICU RN neighbor county never got purple tier. rolls eyes kids wearing masks ride bikes outside. Everytime see gathering house, think, ""I hope one dies house"". Fauci say anything that's common knowledge? seems every single headline "" lotta people getting together coughing other, expect virus spread."" Well fucking shit Fauci thank explaining me. Christmas markets bomb. Hope everyone stays safe. Yeah can't really speak I'm sure they've gotten lot better. recall talks hard keep virus stable development vaccine, clearly since store low temp masks? Bars restaurants open? Party on. wildly ridiculous incorrect way presenting risk viral transmission outdoors. 

I‚Äôm scientist anyone reading know intuitively 200 feet distances effectively fine. 

What you‚Äôve done make bold claim. It‚Äôs prove that. Even measles doesn‚Äôt spread 200 feet outdoors. Well, lot people move Florida Texas (and can't forget California...) Colorado. Perhaps brought stupid them. covid denialist friend high school finally stopped posting crap couple weeks ago. gather real impact now. places could business licenses revoked well regulations loosen give leg businesses following rules We‚Äôre scared too. I‚Äôm starting get first glimpses ‚Äòsurvivor guilt‚Äô much world still unfolds slow escalating horror, I‚Äôm safe C19. I‚Äôm sorry still live this. Happy cake day!  cousin law posted Facebook ""Are vaccines covid baby fetus based?""  clubs leagues buy tests themselves. Leaked videos? Yes eradicate virus need isolate, train departed February.
I'm saying laws, saying - agree then.
Funny bring authoritarian laws Swedish respons bashed liberal. person actively wearing mask job. Everyone supposed wearing one cannot social distance if/when Covid goes work clue continue function. work airport, primary role refueling aircraft includes LifeFlight helicopter fixed wing plane also commercial flights deal lot military well private corporate jets.

I'm shocked managed avoid Covid positive cases passed FBO people enjoy talking ifs, nobody wants take precaution help prevent it. I'm hoping mask simply reduced viral load fully expect test positive next couple weeks. It‚Äôs not. Pay $2.99, it‚Äôs worth it!

Or watch Hulu, access there.

Sadly, ends Trump got COVID-19. There's much really make part 2 time next year. we're testing school aged children. Stay strong. I‚Äôm sorry hear loss hate illness taking away beloved keep hearing people say ""we're peak."" 

This like base camp halfway mountain.  lobby TX lege session. 

I'll best. state lege candidate least two favors. planning calling ranked choice voting. But, real, see group make progress that. feel pain heart. wish could help out. worked retail year, years waiter work IT. I‚Äôd say public good people, ones suck make rest us look bad. European people cant access page D: healthcare workers need babysitting go work. Sounds like better friend person anymore. assume Sunk Cost given scheduled maid honor. But, me, would instead living adage ""Friends come go get health once"" Let's exaggerate, handful people coming back sick another country. controllable, likely cause major problem. control. make think even wanted travel hot bed covid unless absolutely necessary lol?

Also, breaking news, it‚Äôs West opening Vietnam, way around, commercial flights get Vietnam going out. multiple flights US, Europe Vietnam every week, none coming in. shutting travelling who?

Essentially claim bunch stuffs without single proof. can‚Äôt accept West utterly incompetent handling covid, East Asia not. people individually ticketed way fat fine. dont want tell anyone medical field job properly. telling stupid citizens healthy knows, they're part babysit healthcare worker's children go work. beginning he's shown tell whatever lie keeps healthcare workers working. fairness, also lot empty homes people dying, lot new, free job positions people need filled. know many people transitioned high school homeschooling going elementary middle school lives high schools around us suck live far country. kids teach use Tik Tok, teach anything else proper virtual classes. write something, would part memoir lessons-learned pandemic response attempt warn future generations. That's part people also assholes. I'm western NY lowest infection rates, think made people apathetic safe. we're insane boom positives hospitalizations. businesses open summer issues, colder weather college kids back town people hanging inside without masks.  Surprise, surprise highest rate infections last month county 21 year olds. It‚Äôs sad üòî  I‚Äôm cardiac ICU nurse tons COVID patients already. action plan crisis surge involves bringing lower acuity nurses (telemetry, oncology, etc.) take patients ICU nurse‚Äôs job essentially supervise help out. usually one icu nurse would take two ventilated COVID patients, one icu nurse could ‚Äúkinda‚Äù take 5 6 patients. think could work hopefully overwhelming telemetry nurses someone experience rely on, lets spread available ICU nurse staff much thinner. Fuck, hopeful first sentence went downhill there. bad news flashbacks read drive Christmas markets could get pictures 2016 head? Death work. dropped, go around much longer spread virus.  Oh no!! again...stay safe there! Hope resolves quickly last year. That's unusual. I've seen studies indicate there's toxicity 30,000 UI per day taken many months.

The actual harm occurred patients taking insane amounts, like 120,000 UI per day. 150k+ new cases day. Virus control testing can‚Äôt keep up. probably millions infected tested. conservative political icon month two much appreciated everyone trying limit exposure right now. produced multiple companies facilities so. 
Biontech licensing vaccine basically free mostly developed EU funding. 
US funding mostly spend production, development vaccine (if any). astronauts also go space ... little options short weekend trip. I'd reckon trip floatyland lifetime opportunity, we'd see lot travelling more, Members armed forces go without modern conveniences months end, without seeing family.

This highly dependent military force in. US barracks essentially holiday resorts compared virtually military world. That's true bother anything lockdown prevent future infections.
Setting testing, tracing isolating infra time used for. If, like Sweden, bother trace infections, choose observe disease, instead managing it. Lockdown drops amount infected level trace contacts, allowing people isolate get tested, _before_ develop symptoms. wait people develop symptoms, spend days spreading around, especially masks used. ""Oh gosh.¬†You¬†know, I'm much speeches, but, it's¬†so¬†gratifying to¬†leave you¬†wallowing in¬†the mess you've¬†made.¬†You're screwed, thank¬†you, bye."" mention psychosocial aspect caring. feel like I‚Äôm missing building rewarding connections patients higher patient load. ...that's either pathogens jumped species gap. know we‚Äôre fucked long time thank continuing state obvious. Looks like fear-mongering  Maybe immediate deaths. I'm seeing reports nurses young people heart attacks strokes months ""recovering"". Autopsies organs full blood clots. know full ramifications disease years. Different site collecting studies mom nurse tests university‚Äôs football team California. gets tested time! even learn April/May.  So, still gathering pandemic.

I think need crossed fingers. stay strong well; wishing safe happy holidays! What's Americans learned nothing Christmas 4 weeks away? succinct post. Trump

I think sums up... Yeah, people dropping dead streets, overwhelmed hospitals. saw them. Sure, one go medicine money alone. Many do.  
This huge publicly traded companies avoid giving billions dollars stockholders govt control business. think hit 500,000 cases day mid January. route doesn‚Äôt work everyone though. also can‚Äôt expect kids gone person school lives automatically adjust online school *so* much different lot harder lot kids. You‚Äôre alone, sane minds there. It‚Äôll one day. California ! Thanks, sister antigen test positive. enrolled whole family RT PCR test tomorrow, dry cough symptoms since last 3-4 days. antigen tests negative parents dry cough initially. monitoring O2 saturation body temperatures every hour family. Lol. Sorry. lived Florida little went ER almost fainting. I‚Äôm originally Far East Coast pretty scared saw medicine there. Thats prob trump got many votes people didn‚Äôt want admit wrong Low wage essential workers may indeed likely exposed virus. However, lower economic status mean likely die disease itself, bad outcome. 

Old age one important markers risk death. 85+ year old 630x higher likelihood dying Covid 18 year old. 

Hispanic black communities suffered higher rates deaths whites; however, 630x higher. 

Race socioeconomic concerns ""hot topic"" issues media likes highlight. important, especially discussing covid. However, main determining factor bad outcome age, indicated every study every nation across planet. here's problem comment. fact pointing basic nutritional science, actually agree assessment make sure magnesium K levels adequately met.

My problem recommending suppliment it. Vitamin sure, actually hard come adequately balanced healthy diet. I've taking 5,000IU/day since March.

But magnesium super easy come balanced healthy diet. Honestly, list magnesium rich foods long varied. Anyone eating Standard Western Diet likely getting enough magnesium.

We supplementing things like magnesium except extreme cases. COVID wiping Western world eat properly. Thanks friend never tip someone high cost living area actually makes bucks? Wow, peach. X\_\_0 Thank sharing I‚Äôm sorry loss, sending love you. live Oregon. confirm. people living morons. Rounding never ending exponential curve corner! sacrifice seen much appreciated. depression accelerating well also stay course. Somewhere person would near, would spread might gone, still alive thanks try follow guidelines.

During summer restrictions lifted, relatives started going again.

2 make though summer.

Thank effort. Wait, thought tested months, tens thousands volunteers. that's gotta crime, right? Oh no, suck says **everyone** going get either way

**Everyone engages reckless, irresponsible, selfish behaviors**. 

Why hard people right fucking thing? Ok, thanks.

So kind immunity cels provide? seem last longer. Yeah, happening. short staffed enough people fill positions. Tell folks reefer trucks. mom nurse almost 20 years get vaccine thinks might kill her. fine People need stay home, could've already had. spend many months away family. feel like u made mean look username Probably colorblind realize Lame Duck L'Orange dear leader. Awaiting news lockdowns live. Gotta love living useless country like this. coworkers pulled stunt. Employer proactive sending people home, getting testing, contact tracing, still. Come work couple days, tell boss exposed? actually wait symptomatic? Come on. ...what? article Tiktokers mentioned nothing users having/getting Covid. vaccine trials. That's quite right. actual education training health care, jarring may believe conspiracy theories particular way. Like flight attendant flat-earther quarterly reports. mean country? Free often defined ‚Äúfree point use.‚Äù Thankfully pleasant back yard fresh air, indoor fitness equipment suffices. make sense It'll distributed regular people (who health care workers, etc.) via many channels vaccine is. lot people go pharmacy (CVS Walgreens already signed distribute, believe) urgent care center. non-standard thing might states also choose use state-run testing points vaccine sites well. point later 2021 local doctor's office may (particularly approve vaccines without low temp storage requirement.)

They never set distribution airports. need set aside space ""reactions"" vanishingly small percentage serious adverse reactions happen immediately, handled existing health care system.

There's also need anything special prepare administer vaccine. Lots people give shots - anyone least year nursing medical school - prepping consists thawing sucking syringe.

Pfizer (or pharma company) anything distribution, profits make. that's horizon viewing life way short term

Or maybe life depressing care 1.5 years vanishing like that. /u/Thrill2112 mentioned could severely understaffed. quite inept imho. Like good job, able manage tackle workload 4 people. imagine syringes walking runway photographer's cameras flashing constantly. Ocean's Twelve crappy movie tho  Yes. right.

A silver lining positive aspect something overall negative.

The overall negative describing. overall negative occur, silver lining would famous people getting vaccine could influence fence-sitters, folks vague sense hesitation, get vaccine sooner rather later. it‚Äôs distinct us. It‚Äôs based comorbidities people. patronizing white liberal guilt crazy. think get much vocal January.... it‚Äôs got killing hold then. ever responsible 1st grader 7th graders?

Its fucking hell trying manage ‚Äúmedical place‚Äù drop knowledge, lot multis use magnesium oxide hit label RDA percentage. Absorption magnesium oxide slim none. things, like getting enough sleep exercising, known good health advocated health professionals. stuff might consider whether actually know medical experts whether they're well supported might believe. comes things like extreme diets taking high doses supplements need indications might benefits also solid evidence long term harm. Kinda funny upvoted, yet everyone sub also apoplectic *possibility* NFL players getting vaccine them, theory hasn‚Äôt even close substantiated. know country live in, literally every form transportation take (aside maybe walking biking, extent) ""daddy government"" allowing travel. That's already case. Whether that's driver's license, passport, no-fly list, funds public transit, discretion ""daddy government"". arguing locking travel, seem mistaken freedom travel USA. They're climate controlled much civilian aircraft.

Source: C130 mechanic 8 years. ü§£üëç keep safe possible masks distancing hand washing, etc.  edit add: I‚Äôm sure anyway. wanted remind ( me) help vigilant. likelihood seems pretty low. vaccines need kept cold they're given multiple doses course weeks. [for want see duet video, fixed share crazies FDA's vaccine advisory committee meeting 10th. They'll presumably recommend vaccine approved vaccine approved shortly that. originally wrong; must corrected it. definitely checked didn‚Äôt want sound like dick pointing OP‚Äôs typo. speak sarcasm, genuinely hope happens.

Let celebrities sports stars get vaccines. Let brag shout immune. Give mindless followers obsessors incentive go seek vaccination themselves.

It hard follow celebrity Twitter want deal pretentiousness. standpoint, looks beneficial prissy glamourlords profess importance vaccine many people can. influences even small percentage unsure people change mind get vaccination, that's win us all. pretty much conceptualize every day come work probably going worse day before, it‚Äôs going way curve slows down,‚Äù said. possibility mob people raiding pharmacy vaccines becoming common practice Grandma lives business gets stay open... easy choice make anyone ounce empathy 3 braincells. know tell buddy. There's literally publications institutions world seriousness pandemic. Unless actually worldwide conspiracy implying, really stupid sound.

With logic, going reject information given everything ""corrupt"". point can't informed, goodbye individual thought. feel much. barely go outside days. step counter maybe showing 1000 steps day. know something this, work childcare, there‚Äôs time. Great resource.

So 3 RCTs, 2 3 positive, but...

One positive ones blinded 76 patients. 40 patients nonclinical biomarker endpoint, even count. Finally, negative study 240 patients.

There also 3 mendelian randomization studies, also support likely causal associations, two three negative. 

The rest pretty much circumstantial, kind confounding seen disease states associated vitamin - buy attempted adjustments baseline status.

So take want to. Heck almost half us mildly deficient anyway. going save us pandemic. Ugh, yeah. I'm sure Jr sucking shots Regeneron whatever. God damn awful... c17 essentially commercial air liner. main difference (aside military specific crap) sirens time making look good inside. Mechanical stuff exposed, plastic coverings, etc. But, fully pressurized, climate controlled, bathrooms, etc.

A c130 much less hospitable. Safe human traffic, comfortable. education real school important? Selfish, stupid bastards.

I propose new rule: host party (at club house) responsible paying medical bills anyone gets COVID event.

Someone dies? That's homicide charge. reason Atlas crash happened guy flying completely clueless flying Cessna let alone widebody airliner. Reading circumstances crash infuriating easily avoidable was. 

If important flight full vaccines I'm sure would make sure pilots best best. schools safe now? happened closing schools they're leading cause outbreak? typical AMERICA BAD trope Reddit.

I'm going pretend deep understanding takes stage vaccine development, know people working tirelessly make vaccine focused making world better compared petty worrying gets ""credit"".

Reddit incredibly toxic I‚Äôm page you, I‚Äôm worried side effects deterring people. I‚Äôve read people saying may need day work following second dose due side effects. could see already skeptical folks deciding get start seeing people get really sick even lasts 24 hours less. 

I wonder time spent could reduce side effects somehow make 1 dose instead 2. Make appealing guess way say it. 

It‚Äôll interesting see end requiring people get it. government mandate? companies mandate it? type mix two? odds super low, agree. crashes; mid-air event serious enough disturb cargo probably liable break, needs super-cooled whatnot. odds probably like 1 hundred thousand instead million.

In event, control likely crash car tonight anyhow. worth worrying about. Sounds like food poisoning me. hope feel better soon. terrible many people situation right around corner. fallout going ripple effects decade least. hope things look you. family didn‚Äôt even travel feel weird responsible gathering. outdoors, 6 adults (half work office environments strict masking guidelines) 2 kids live town/community. outside socializing eating buffet style us wearing masks still hoping stay healthy ü§ûüèº

Edit: half totally work home Well that‚Äôs thing too...it may even rights. wife white collar professionals can‚Äôt work home all. kids school age yet would stuck. Logic tells Pfizer vaccine distributed Urban areas, moderna rural places. knows  Heck, local doctors lead COVID-19 response call pfizer-vaccine (I chilling home overheard non-work phone call...) Zombies coming. sad reality many working class Americans. I'd love say would change hope workers get rights this. This. I'm trying brace numbers coming. I've heard estimates knows one right. Right I'm thinking 2k deaths day end week, 3k deaths day within 2 weeks. something fundamentally wrong protecting tv shows protecting health care workers. *ding ding ding!* I'm agreeing you. correct. wrong. latest study vitamin dosing convincing enough me. 100% clear: exactly 1 study showing effect single, high dose Vitamin 10 days symptoms effective reducing mortality.

Yes, now, best randomized placebo controlled reasonable take away would Vitamin effective single high dose disease 

Agreed.   here. Yeah. makes think politicians executives claim drinking tap water places fracking damage safe, refuse drink said water. ""It trumps is"" Sure. *extracurricular* activities.

When doctors educators talk ""school"", they're talking classes, athletic fields theaters.

 talk athletic fields theaters, invariably recommend, ""No. Just... no."" feel kind guilty here, honestly... watched South Park special detached reality made anxious people know. report says bodies sre unburied one claiming them. strength argument carried day Reddit tactics might necessary.  think know lucky even half words write actually read. Given that, think choice bold words elegant approach skimmers clumsy ""TL;Dr"" end post. 

If expected people read every word wrote consider word choices, would, generally speaking, pretty disappointed result. Perhaps read consider every word, really rely upon that. Yeah, article gossip-y ""However, remained unclear many doses board exactly cargo shipment arrived O'Hare.""

oooooh~~ depends comfortable mass graves everythinf screeching halt large portion country sick crippled once. watched Korean baseball. Yo, report states 650 bodies buried financially unclaimed. OP implies many bury. Get real. Also re: elementary schools opening middle high schools... remote learning complete fraud utter garbage anyone K-12, it‚Äôs absolute worst elementary students. They‚Äôre least able work independently, need person most. Well, rate, probably will. Zero increase mean, since reach hard cap able measure three. basically state need massive military style mobilization distribute vaccine(s) stop over-stress health system, think transition level normalcy. Whereas countries managed pandemic well controlled measured distribution plan, simultaneously normalize.

Basically, difference jet landing gracefully large, smooth runway perfect weather, one that's lost engines, gears, unresponsive controls, drunk pilot, attempt belly land forest hurricane add small silver lining this, couple nice things come pandemic. 1) Work home much common widely accepted, less people getting sick needing go work sick transmitting others. 2) Masks much commonplace public. I, one, wearing one public winter anytime I'm feeling 100%, anytime fly, since partner manages catch something EVERY FLIGHT someone coughing back head.

These things likely also make illnesses like flu less prevalent (and already year), make easier public respond properly next pandemic. Yeah thought must uptake know baby mice uptake maternal breast milk antibodies, baby humans receptors, later research shows receptors stop working humans birth. Pretty cool science evolved. lolled this. Thank you. census data referring includes parental status redditors? I'd love see. go actual article see grammar correct. likely typo. thinking this... people severely lacking communication skills, might getting diagnosed disease gets bad it‚Äôs obvious, rather disease mild early observation/intervention helpful.

Kind like baby toddler gets sick, can‚Äôt really tell what‚Äôs bothering badly. aren‚Äôt blatant signs sickness (sneezing, coughing, fever) judge sick based well know patterns behavior. known months Pfizer one companies working vaccine success it. air board already late... longer question get sick will.get sick still half record NJ. bear mind lead per capita deaths still, half produced super great.  Maybe stored pharmacies, maybe they'll kind mobile unit keep cold enough gets used, maybe hospitals handling administering it. I'm sure lot figured close figured out. It‚Äôs skin color. It‚Äôs minority groups adversely impacted way that‚Äôs distinct them. Monorail! Governor President caring economy human life guess. Moderna already started Phase 1 trial Mar 16. means vaccine developed that. rest time getting saw news recently kept zooming United Arlines logo. United pay extra advertising something? virus impacts different groups differently. data months pandemic study supports conclusion.  it‚Äôs choice unfortunately wait committee decide vaccine priority list next week. sure guys right schools stay open, essential workers alongside healthcare people. actually Moderna started Phase 1 testing Mar Well lot places free refuse entry employment gotten vaccinated.

At least still plan get vaccinated it. guess we‚Äôll wait see, either way, trust experts fauci decent plan effectively distribute vaccine Personal morals shouldn't, sociatal ethics morals should.

Personal morals get pharmacists refusing sell birth control tight lipped all. following vaccine news, already public Moderna started Phase 1 trial Mar Low function autistic patients touch everything, including face, without reservation. also dangerous patients tell no, anything. really simple. Yep...I think that's struggle working parent. long conversation house came risk. Would want kids school? Yes! Would want risk anyone bubble? all. would Trump get credit? far know, involved developing vaccine way. Shouldn‚Äôt looking positivity rate? properly compare places.

Eg states much worse shape Lol normies. Us introverts going work staying inside lives. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs they‚Äôve stopped using this, much still trying locate next kin people really coming short. possible covid 0 symptoms. possible covid one symptom. possible covid symptoms. virus strange one think exposed, harm getting test confirm. Close ya jackass got downvoted, probably implied teachers putting kids first, completely agree sentiment comment.

I'm teaching person 3x/week. hate say this, common sentiment I've seen teachers (on reddit only) purely concern getting COVID kids. Fine. get that, especially high risk. However, I've seen lot teachers unwilling take chances classroom, willing take chances elsewhere, that's unacceptable. fact, reddit archetype teacher isolating times teaching extremely rare real life. teachers know much like regular population. is, going bars/restaurants open. flying around country Thanksgiving. meeting groups friends movie nights. 90% teachers, greatest COVID risks come personal choices, occupation.

Then come reddit people think absurd ask teachers take marginal risk teaching person N95 mask stake education entire generation. one hesitates say doctors nurses work right through, even though working *directly* COVID-positive patients actively sick spewing coronavirus everywhere. heard single person reddit lament plight instacart worker, constantly grocery stores get contactless groceries. education worth sacrifice? level acceptable risk? many younger teachers, greater risk dying way school car accident dying COVID, especially dying COVID caught school wearing N95 mask.

A lot people ones claim need make sacrifices greater good. mean donning N95 accepting marginally higher risk getting COVID sake children's learning?  ok, close eyes imagine hard alternate reality... Fucking site lol!  Together, come together collectively make billionaires even richer. dad hung friends. He's person knows caught already ironically pretty safe. shit, whole system designed allow shit open faster nobody enforcing you‚Äôre judging tier system rising case numbers, yes doesn‚Äôt work. 

But suggest Californians lock homes 5 weeks leave neighborhood? Good thing nobody needs go work grocery drug store. Wife spent thanksgiving alone close contact. family members were/are pissed probably spared 10 cases. Totally worth Im like vaccines anyone seen utopia??? obsessed. number person That's interesting since ""tick vaccine"" lyme disease thing, pulled market US people decades ago.  think still sell version dogs.    

But vaccines listed new one time.  remember polio vaccine came out.  quite thing, different era then. crazy governor...oh well past million cases already. obstructed real data quite time. Hogan excellent. Agreed. go rocks got Halloween. possible COVID19 symptoms related fever diarrhea, zero cough, zero breathing problems, smell taste lost?

Thank you. spot here. precisely 7 day moving average number gives lot info.  Since 7 day correlation sense due reporting works, best compare today 7 days ago get meaningful statistis.... Thursday often peak, point Saturday-Monday often low. example Sunday low one week. high probability Sunday low following week. Politicians They'll need BYOB plan insurance. Thank god. hard tell LOT d00mers say similar things said. Weak-sauce? killed almost 7000 Swedes

No. covid ‚â† covid. Total deaths line previous small country like Sweden, lot people.

It's lot people considering level hysteria around many hypochondriacs are. anyone else kinda worried there's going another spike people careless ""the vaccine pretty much here."" Can't hospitalize capacity. Whoever $$$ lot really can't. making divide country even greater. 

Most young children physical learners. makes sense. Anyone seen toddler knows touch something observe reaction. 

As language skill develops, elementary kids move away this, all. math taught manipulatives (blocks) grammar often taught cards (to move words around). touching part learning. 

As kids progress upwards, topics almost impossible teach online. teach kids sing together choir? Virtual labs thing, kids learning lab safety procedures. learning standing front people. 

But even more. Physical school provides host benefits kids, especially risk potentially served home. 

There kids well virtual environment, far 100%. mutually exclusive things. recovery rate COVID-19 99%. may long term effects vaccine manifest years least.  Well good thing opening Christmas cases shoot right back Revoke nursing license 2018 attending vocational school people disabilities. grandfather helping us pay parents type money afford tuition school. sadly passed away leave school. :( That‚Äôs right line right get shots. Don‚Äôt worry what‚Äôs them. friends jumped bridge, would too? Congratulations you‚Äôre 2nd grade critical thinking level work film. We‚Äôre probably getting tested industry there. 

That truly disgusts me. friends teachers nurses can't even get tested often. congratulate successful fortune telling. Simultaneously heartwarming heartbreaking. many iu mega dose? He‚Äôs immune good. anyone left White House hasn‚Äôt gotten it? think they‚Äôll fine. Frustrating pictures posted partying, going theme parks, attending sporting events, taking kids birthday parties, maskless crowds, etc. - especially complain go work. Sooo CARES act running states going bankrupt unemployment, what‚Äôs next step? People obviously don‚Äôt give shit anymore do? I‚Äôm sick getting fucked financially thing isn‚Äôt getting better Absolutely taking vaccine escorted undead Ed Sullivan. Can‚Äôt let liberal hoax stop getting $9 slow cooker $5 blu rays! /s states yes, hardest hit ones first wave like NY NJ reached old peaks yet hardest hit ones current wave starting go now. like 10 million. problem Florida it‚Äôs full Floridians. Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine get approval EU European Medical Agency U.S. Food Drug Administration? smartest career move. JT stupid ""working together"" matter bad relations are. Nobody trusting China anything tbh. never normal? What? I've definitely noticed myself. Usually I'm lot active, especially fall, leading ski season.

A couple weeks ago *slept wrong* fucked back. muscle spams left hamstring gotten super tight I'm sitting time.

I'm usually one take time go walk, life involved lot walking working pre-covid. surprisingly big lifestyle change. What's Britney Spears song? ""Oops Got Again""? news: NYC schools opening back up! Damn, sound rough. Applaud effort, you‚Äôll stronger it...shitty year. Schools reopening tho... probably *will* die it.

And basing percentage that's tiny grand scheme things. exposure notification system works many people smartphone turn use it. 2 3 people state use it, system likely work unless 2 3 people live work near pass other, one uses app anonymously report system infected, person remain completely anonymous. two people would receive alert recommeding take COVID-19 test soon possible see infected, too. one others infected, person self isolate around 14 days prevent shedding virus spreading disease, person could go hospital treatment sick, e.g., difficulty breathing, thinking, walking, etc. Restaurants linked one biggest spreaders. might confidence safe effective, medical experts do. enough people vaccinated start *slowing* spread within months end next year virus pretty well contained. virus actually mutate quickly, mutant stains may much concern, pop there's good chance one current vaccines still effective quickly adapted protect it. vaccines expired time plane finished taxiing O‚ÄôHare. mean first responders, healthcare workers, severe comorbidties?? Honestly uncalled statement. need play pretend nonsense. Covid sucka kids ynderstand things going same. Shielding bullshit hurts more.  Take care. brother high functioning spectrum.

Think tiny chance once. /r/selfawarewolves ? 230,000 people dead, hundreds thousands suffering permanent effects, millions grieving dead loved ones. sure, definitely serious.

Burn Hell.  Schools superspreader havens, can't keep pretending schools safe.

This happens keep education system 17th century already transition kids online classrooms. whole ""butts seats"" logic needs die every facet society, paying dearly stubborn. virus. coronavirus. HIV type virus too. types coronaviruses SARS MERS neither vaccine developed successfully. Coronaviruses quite different Influenza, coronavirus. absolute first. same, HIV virus vaccine serious problem 40 years. Understand?  hospitalizations absolutely flatten.

We're going hit capacity, start sending people home die. 

And we're almost there. Wow obnoxious Necessary? Yes. Implemented? Maybe. Enforced? No. Hotel? Trivago. Presumably going research reports confirm really safe might bitter, seem unnecessarily heartless towards someone rough spot.  Um vaccines modern medicine. you‚Äôre hospital get it. also bring hospital kill people . part don‚Äôt understand? sure ok. like there‚Äôs deadly global pandemic anything... think anyone suggesting would distributed normally pharmacies yet. assume they'll select sites set proper facilities begin with.

But even widespread public distribution, think could manage it. They'd frequent deliveries fresh stock pharmacies. inconvenience, sure, hardly impossible. like lump coal stocking personally bars nightclubs closing. since mid-March, walk past sometimes there's absolutely distancing mask wearing them. *do* eat restaurants people space out, wear mask sat down, generally behave much better they're drinking. 

Churches full religious people, think god save covid. I've taken [anthrax requires FIVE shots course 18 months, annual boosters that. vaccine HURTS. 

I could totally see someone wanting take 2nd dose effects bad first. Yes no: 

March one area crisis. could pull staff wherever needed. 

You make beds makeshift hospitals. without staff basically become morgues. No. vaccine reduces chances getting seriously sick dying. There's evidence stopping people contagious. go get COVID-19 kind defeating purpose getting vaccine.

I doubt people change behavior much either way honest. might take less toll mental health know practice social distancing next months versus next year. Strange won‚Äôt read data administer vaccine hundreds (maybe even thousands) others. case, you‚Äôre point administration, data approved lot people much much experience, education credibility field. Chill I'm going talking hard therapy long time   remember DeBlasio pushing keep schools open March others telling close, also March 20 years ago point memory might shot now... gather church

Yeah man really care magical sky god believe really really dangerous. Please sake fellow worshipers gather church. one fault pandemic. Small business owners bear brunt. society bear brunt health small businesses make money. state federal government needs step in. like insurance company accident parties involved fault pay. 

The government needs pay people stay home need pay small businesses stay closed. irks fuck people claim small business caring well beings, keep voting party keeps blocking legislation take care businesses. People suck I‚Äôm longer certain similarities greater differences. live Utah.

SOL Ya concern scared living close by. keep trying compromise virus? Two week lockdown minimum. 

We already 2+ week school lockdown NYC, example. planning open elementary schools (with many Covid-19 limitations) Dec 7. whole lives revolve around various compromises. example, spite many road accidents still drive. take precautions like seat belts, speed limits, etc. sit home day make sure nothing happens. like 2020 again. I'm told California world's fifth largest economy, think they'll fine. Look covidactnow link. issue right ICU usage topping out. So, spreading bullshit can't read fucking header CDC page, also misrepresenting issue downplay it. Leave Germans get shit done Id bet reporting negatives either time frame. states can't legally enforce limits church gathering sizes recent Supreme Court ruling. believe also need go job every day pay rent utilities. don‚Äôt work home option, barely make enough stay afloat. job(s) require interacting people wear mask hope best US, experts like Fauci expecting widespread usage April. Kids bringing COVID home killing mom, dad, grampa grandma lot damage. Minorities tend intergenerational households, tend conditions like obesity high blood pressure, significantly increases chance death serious complications COVID.  let's science whole, 2021  lot LMS systems provide curriculum store teacher customizations. allows school retain learning path huge disruption curriculum teacher exits. education software companies employ ex teachers design curriculum. long matter walking CVS get vaccine, much like flu shot, I'd completely fine opening knowing county vaccinated. 10%, okay fuck that, long something reasonable blunt spread keep hospitals overwhelmed, I'd qualms it. rather take chances virus vaccine, guest, I'm putting whole life hold people who've made informed decision. file 12 month CARES Act forbearance. restructure mortgage end tack end mortgage, extend mortgage 12 months. federally backed mortgages. sure would apply large commercial multi family either.

Some mortgage companies refused follow CARES act though, creates complications, probably lawsuits road. here. son high risk attend public school without COVID-19 vaccine. already health issues I'm chancing long term effects COVID-19. remote learning local school district shut remote learning program decided homeschool. lines pretty perfectly schools across country began reopen person learning.

It depends organize process. open schools w/o social distancing rules, without mandatory masks, without frequent testing, additional spread. many communities change process made schooling quite safe. reading news 1 day time


Everything lives grand total days small decisions actions piled time. Good bad Unrelated article, absolutely despise even reputable sources like Post turned clickbait bullshit titles tough years never journalist No, made shit defined entirely invented cutoff elderly misrepresent IFR lower actually is. Okay, bad! assuming could 50s vaccinated within first couple rounds. provide evidence IFR 65 .7%, works! Tik toks debunked independent fact checkers

As tend monitor Tiktok scene, could give hint might find independent analysis? closed extra curriculars, thing going school. That's case many states here. still known there's causal relationship. Finland worst, 1 case narcolepsy per 12,000 vaccinees. Sweden 3 cases narcolepsy per 100,000 vaccinees, normal rate 1/100,000. 

The monitoring, "" seems likely yet unidentified additional factor operating Sweden Finland."" username checks Dr. Joseph Varon. interviewed NBC/CNN/BBC multiple ""All pilots Pakistan"" Like scene movie contagion Yeah, republicans read article, headline. Read it. experts recommend. Keep schools open limitations (social distancing, smaller classes, masks, etc.) Dumbshit, elderly = people 65, 50. downvoted request evidence claim true. one spreading misinformation. I've interpreted data way like, fine. said anything that's untrue. compare Fauci Hitler? seems current regurgitation. workplaces (schools especially) made reasonable effort employees work within six feet whenever possible. also possible infectious period overlap. may symptoms tested positive within 10 days working OP's wife (especially consider two weeks isolation typically 10 days). Yeah that's Texas; everything normal outside opting person classes. Football, basketball, playoffs, competition, etc. going.

Also required get negative test. quarantine 10 days get come back. admins telling quarantine tell anyone. Parents telling kids say positive otherwise can't participate extra curriculars. Welcome fucked school systems are. someone says one place close, places close.

Absolutely not. essential society everyone needs bar, especially indoors, drunk people quickly violate social distancing mask rules get infected. least elementary school quite possible hybrid cohort systems allow kids learn may school days online days reduce crowding, minimizing chances viral spread. Frequent testing also helps isolate outbreaks. Many localities now, including New York City. People saying ‚Äúoh no, 2-3 weeks hits fan‚Äù since March. Things may get worse likely incrementally do. Idk suppose people wear masks shops schools right?(well, maybe kids eat lunch?) guess infections come people visiting family/friends small workplaces follow safety guidelines maybe? think mRNA vaccines need cold storage due half life, makes dispersal bit interesting.  number family members nurses tell family members COVID big deal, hospitals overrun pandemic. PRETTY GIRL

WRECKIN BAR! less likely,but rare. Remember Spring Breakers Florida? Wait, Dr. Mike do? Trumpiest wannabe Trump's thing happen. Vision getting blurry better recovering COVID early March.

Had recent physical diagnosed diabetes. I'm otherwise vision healthy suddenly get diabetes may less cautious Id like, spread disinformation. Ok let's use link, looks like average arond 75% mark. like 15% higher claimed initially, yes high inprotantly higher saw, capacity. Still around 25% beds available (does include surge capacity?)


As aside: CDC needs either update stuff mark date clearly. Even spreadsheet claims updated today reporting date July. It‚Äôs like watching slowest moving, obvious train wreck seen evidence that. Brought people said would 60k deaths, deaths would flatline 0 June. reason know IHME Bill Gates pumps much money them. Yeah, see people think that's normal good kids keep change routine every weeks depending Covid flows. cost containing pandemic. accept it. contracts signed, government know ones would successful.

So another way looking is, ordered 50 million vaccines, 7 times. need 1 work get herd immunity whole country sounds like food poisoning. covid. reason even thing America destroyed typical ""American Dream"" family afford parent stay home. Schools become glorified day cares minimal learning, parents work 80 hours week barely survive.

This nonsense many levels. 1) Many women today WANT work career, develop skills make money, want home makers often accepted ""good old times"" 2) developer countries, including prosperous ones, parents families work, matter income level. US among many wealthy families afford one caregivers work, still work want to, need to. 3) many ways make schools safe, done NYC using 2-3 cohorts hybrid model ensure kids school separated, everyone must wear masks, frequent random testing (that part city trying improve now), temperature checks every morning, lunches eaten desk prepared advance, etc. rocket science schools develop relatively safe way kids school. family work home kids al remote, education efficient. much better school. increased mandatory vacation, sick leave, etc. par many developed EU countries, solve issue marginal education kids learning online. Christmas going worst covid we‚Äôve seen yet. Buy food stay home. I'd imagine truly started problem, something like police national guard protecting would happen seems pretty unlikely. property social distanced. wide, questions asked.

Who gets decide that? You? makes special? besides, they're already used partly responsible random people's deaths patrons leave drunk. suddenly pretend care second-hand bar deaths? Got shut athletics too. I'm higher ed residential campus. We've zero known classroom transmission. We've ton athletic transmission quite lot spread dorms since everyone roommates. We're one broke private universities relies heavily room board fees survive much longer. Sounds like norovirus Instant tears eyes looking picture. could imagine health care workers go daily, appreciate you. Thank you! going teacher glad didnt. Teachers treated disposable income 100% ccp need dealt harshly. global effort destroy make bend knee would pretty cool would agree there. would help teachers even online curriculum. We're expected take in-person curriculum make work online session. emt, floor nurse tell doesnt bother mrsa precautions cuz, ""everyday anyway."" even glove. regular ppl knew shit nurses docs say...look Dr. Mike (what asshat). Yes, back March go off-brand crackers grocery store picked bare. really, sacrifice deserves epic songs history books. I‚Äôm glad county locked F down. I'd consult pediatrician Please provide source IFR people 50 .7%. I‚Äôm trying negative people acting like vaccine FDA approved everyone gonna get right away. Pfitzer enough maybe 50 million people end year 600 million end next year. 7.59 billion people world USA alone 331 million people. Y‚Äôall 8 months figure out. Stop stalling get list. SARS MERS vaccines reached Phase clinical trials, looked safe effective, insufficient funding simply need (for SARS) take further. 

HIV slew challenges vaccine design relevant Covid. put simply, since people's immune systems defeat natural Covid infections protect future infection, engineer vaccine thing, better. people recover HIV themselves. prefaced comment stating doctor got message telling comment got banned since claimed medical professional without proof. possibility answer sent email adress could send documentation approved applied nifty green comment name. case think taking normal precautions sufficient you‚Äôre still showing symptoms. Wearing mask public areas, favoring outside activities, etc. think experience March proved absolutely can. Field hospitals, hospital ships, Using hallways parking lots beds.

Can certainly increase capacity, quality care gonna dive deaths going go :/ pretty fucking sick pathetic get kick spreading disinformation disease that's killed 270K+ Americans juicing spread. strangle kittens child well? daddy hurt you? Sociopath.  tb0x! Surprised nythro reported yet too. make payroll, make repairs improvements, pay property tax, etc. Midwest well lately Faith lmao, I'm good thanks. didn‚Äôt need tell that. thanks downer. enough 2020. one word press conferences said squat sleep, exercise anything else list. know medical experts MEDICAL experts. focus medicine money is. money fasting things list. 

And standard evidence pampered standard based upon high level proof harmaceutical companies need products harmful. Everything list works thousands people. need randomize, double-blind, placebo controlled, crossover studies know something works. welcome standard, wait decades anything actually works. 1960's two medical doctors independently told running bad health; doctor time said good, 1990's.

""Doctors nurses actually job now"" asked thoughts El Paso tragedy school northern Illinois tried everything right. slew procedures place keep everyone safe. go back in-person start October. first week November, many teachers sick quarantine fill positions subs. Every sub working 8 9 periods. Non-teaching staff like pulled away jobs sub. chaos. Even teachers teaching home, still need adults sit room kids there, enough adults go around. went remote 16th. way bc vaccine free sit need based allocation isn‚Äôt true all. several science articles day. sure gatekeeping here. still need personnel run overflow hospitals. unlimited amount trained medical professionals many either sick burnt out. Both. vulnerable people immunocompromised either cannot take vaccine work them. people protected everybody else getting vaccine causing virus become rare even eradicated. vulnerable people e.g. elderly-but-not-super-frail, diabetes, obesity, heart conditions etc, taking vaccine would likely directly protect infected Covid. vaccine would really change immune system's ability fight disease, Covid. chuck moltav cocktail it. Immediately different problem. happened NYC

Its happening parts country Cuomos gonna word Best plan I‚Äôve spent 10 last 11 New Years concert...I kinda miss concerts... places Texas, least, things get rough holidays.

I left house except medical procedures since fucking March. 

What asshole. humans like this. learned Spanish flu? think we‚Äôre likely see fema camps set doubt public intelligence courage proof vaccination admissions. They're going wait case count drop result vaccinations really dumb game prisoners dilemma. *We absolutely care this.*

It's political coup giant US pharma corp gets full credit vaccine, development *actually* done:

 - European country
 - ... universal healthcare
 - ... ~1k employee pharma company
 - ... founded 2 Turkish immigrants

This reality help shoot sorts bullshit lies seen ""conventional wisdom"" US, as:

 - High drug prices US companies research
 - can't afford universal healthcare
 - need giant (~80k employee) pharma companies research
 - We're better banning people Muslim countries

IMO, everyone calls ""Pfizer vaccine"" instead ""BioNTech"" ""German"" one is, inadvertently not, supporting harmful lies instead helping fight them. happened Italy back March. We've nearly hit capacity several states. Sure, media already scared people believing vaccine took placebo.
# #1 Yup propaganda article. Stuff like tries justify government incompetence. ""what's point article make seem ton young, healthy people dying COVID ""

That die spread Covid. conspriacy solved. OP said kitchen. asked within six feet responded know.

1.4\^5 5.37824. would mean that, average, prevent catching COVID, also save 5.38 infections line. 4.8% chance one 5.38 people 0.9% people die.

So there's low chance death healthy individual, there's roughly 1 chance 20 that, given individual avoided catching COVID taking precautions, somebody else die would never caught, never would catch COVID first place, thus owuld lived. that...luckily bought fucking corporations lot battleship construction slowed cancelled realized aircraft carriers much better. key getting restaurant service days dress like panda?

Good awesome! point, site claiming ""Swedens hospitals overrun Swedish politicians decided lock save economy"" since completely false;

1. Hospitals overrrun
2. Sweden never strategy based achieving herd immunity allowing spread
3. Sweden Health Agency responsible pandemic response law decisions based science law, illegal politicians meddle it. called ""minister rule"" illegal Sweden.
4. Swedish constitution allow lock downs, never option Sweden begin with.

I mean, I‚Äôm kidding... little bit need wait result, quick tests notoriously inaccurate. Useless. know public health experts saying awhile. tests done young, hesitant roll ou vaccines  Every study looked two year total period (presumably track long term effects?) 


You'd invalidate study order this. sole reason volunteer anything conducted city - feeling job (250+ days domestic international travel annually) end *requiring* vaccination, risk getting one soon possible. who? you?

Because every day talk parents whose kids getting needs met. 

In district, according last survey, 79% parents said wanted kids go back least person learning. 

We objective metrics another year so, amount kids fallen behind required learning goals tremendous. Already, district change grading rubrics many kids failing. 

It working. even adequate. say ""we can't go school dangerous teachers"" lie virtual instruction adequate. isn't. can't speak states, New Mexico (at least Las Cruces), hitting mask mandates social distancing initiatives hard, they've good job part.

But help El Paso, TX 45 minutes away cities size least hundred miles.

Also 94:6, 6 got infected hundred think died. coincidence, received notice dear Governor. came Disney World news app still relevant 

Governor DeSantis Says Florida New Lockdowns, Mask Mandates, COVID-19 Measures Watch out, got genius math assumes they're counting confirmed tested cases starting point. That's unlikely. They're almost certainly looking 13 million least multiplying 4 already happened case count.

There various papers studies measuring phenomenon, multiplicative factor period time since initial start outbreak varied, expected, access testing interest testing varied. Yea problem. It‚Äôs cold hell right now. Yes. eBay. Hindsight 20/20. general consensus masks shifted drastically. mid-March, quite ways beyond that, mask guidance deemed important. CDC even recommend masks April. Lol Actually, vets much better COVID. many people got pandemic puppies. Couple people home spending time pets, thus noticing abnormalities much sooner, massive surge caseload. vets area busy turn away dozens pets every day can't keep demand. pets end going emergency hospitals. 

I'm emergency vet hospital work overwhelmingly busy since COVID started. days 4-6+ hour wait times nearby ER hospitals even stop allowing cases come they're capacity. smaller practices suffered, yes, overall revenue skyrocketed vets. 

I say, though, us would gladly sacrifice increase revenue go back less-stressful days pre-COVID, that's rant another time.  pessimist 

It's fascinating watching people label realistic outlook events like pandemic term. What's efficacy percentage of, say last years seasonal flu vaccine? free. tax dollars paid it. Imagine giving elderly die month later complications. Talk waste maybe one looking somewhere else live. Take advice, mate. Pfizer trial admit anybody prior *diagnosed* covid19 infection. course, people enrolled never symptoms never got tested.

[This one even better determine Big part corn subsidies lower price high fructose corn syrup making accessible ""asymptomatic studies studies"" get wrong I'd happily take symptoms majority population, ideally transmission symptoms. month gap two shots sounds like barrier well, especially younger generations. Say April/May potentially start getting vaccinated, guys reckon still restrictions place? first shot sort protection month second shot? cancelling Christmas probably bit much

I never thought would read sentence. point consider reinfection much issue. definitely cases happens, percentage extremely low. several million cases total, reinfection going issue would seen significantly cases occurred. vaccine easy part. vials packaging hard part. always choice CVS flu shot want. think thing. I'm longer threat anybody anything I'm less likely get sick compared workers sick yet.
But cry. Sunday. Wisconsin reports weekend deaths Tuesday.  think created placebo metric shit-ton data draw already. assuming immunity lasts extended period time figure long lasts scheduled vaccine eliminate it. I've thinking looking joining trial, I'm scared. also, I'd like something society can. appreciate info. Well, 30 people developed trial numbers speak themselves. Yeah. folks plain crazy. pay anything? Go it, Australia prison colony now. don‚Äôt hate UK, hate Australia well wouldn‚Äôt wounding nonexistent national pride.  People angry spoke truth. working industry similar, press releases meaningless since fuddle numbers want. irony I'm sure they'll still bill exorbitant rate even though shitty field hospital. tried tested proven. Nobody knows long term effects mRNA vaccines, know years, may take long time manifest. Anyway, take it, I'll effectively giving endorsement system ""prove vaccinated able anything remotely enjoyable"", system absolutely support. I'm small satellite office we've working home since March. 7-year lease January.

It's really stable job too, nothing outsource done US citizens. It‚Äôs shame especially kids aren‚Äôt showing parent problem. Yea, relatively recent attitude ""it's profit, they're definitely fake / evil"" silly.

There always always snake oil peddlers, mere fact business makes something profit good predictor whether product legitimate. there's studies shown that, also studies showing get worse even get it.

Even voluntary. love walking, Covid would travel Chattanooga walk two hours around city taking photos disagree intolerance ignorance fighting misinformation selfishness. 

My suggestion meet selfishness. Saying fuck guys die won't, may feel nice (I too), change reality actually need cooperation. 

It challenge us create limits, consequences responses bad behavior. I'm shaming outting people. fucking works. think get vaccinated get special credentials verified using phones. vaccinated get come cruise, go shopping mall, make reservations fancy restaurant, go team's baseball games, etc. 

If assume, well I'm vaccinated I'll okay, things still fucked. That's point trials. already showed works. I've picked much last days trying reasonably safe I'm pissed off. get it. Big enough sample size releasing participants real life makes sense It'll long slow smash, yeah still encouraging. That's like totally normal.

Also, though, said phrase ""so-called *heard* immunity"" I'm sure much trust article. MRNA vaccine inject sort virus infects anything could considered unique. MRNA replicated cells fragments virus inert, dead, nothing, body recognises threat. So, effects virus 100% bodies immune response, would (in theory) exact matter virus immunised against.

What's say. I'd rather die alone.

In UK Sage experts saying schools play minor roles community transmission. Besides death, virus causes many people life long complications. mention, killed people ages.

So two choices, take safe vaccine help everyone, yourself, others etc. take vaccine possibly hurt others.

It new vaccine, hope know doing, starts hurting people (beyond non life threatening temporary side effects) bigger mess now, much bigger. 

However, shown safe like common flu vaccine etc, take it? work retail job sell scrubs nursing supplies can't tell terrible nurses people medical field wearing masks social distancing. day, talking nurse told works covid unit hospital recently trachs vent. proceeded tell really big deal people probably going catch it. said glasses fogging breathe took mask right front me. I've people come nurses flat-out refuse wear mask however common experience. also seen people wearing masks properly gap top around sides. another nurse Home Health say get antimicrobial scrubs day prior went clients house suspicious death. wait house dead body 4 hours back forth phone medical examiner. properly fitted mask foot away me. nurses tell they're going beach parties vacations can't believe it. cannot enforce mask mandate governor. I'm Florida way. God help us all. vaccine simply developed quickly - damn clue vaccine development works different time make faster without sacrificing quality substance process. 

Is really fair expectation people know vaccine making process works? shit sherlock.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* realize that, fine right? Seriously, fuck wrong you?

The whole fight fuckwads can‚Äôt go bars restaurants five goddamn minutes, people going fucking grocery store. deaths adjusted, graph 30-year downtrend? great way downplay confirmed number deaths positive covid result. license revoked, simple Partly false due incomplete data 2020. 

I posted total deaths reported CDC. looking scary me. Would like debunk figures? honestly shocker me. old friends nurses, NPs, doctors parties, traveling, huge ass weddings like nothing going on. find disgusting wreck less. economy coming back people disposable income feel safe going spending it. cry want bars shutting ones prolonging this. Needs shoot someone first like that, you? would need way ensure sterility, you‚Äôll leftover traces covid-19 create false positive next test.

Sterilize it. Existing PCR machines don‚Äôt require throw away damn wellplate every disposable cost $50-$100.

This combination makes utterly worthless tiny edge cases. everyone shares household infected person gets infected (and 50% I've seen), infections happen going happen first day, right? nothing.

And get point someone live tested positive it, would take precautions? far inevitable. That's entire point.

Like I'm sure ""there needs communication around household spread inevitable people find worthwhile take precautions"" controversial idea I'm downvoted it. literally official medical (this study 38% household contacts testing positive basically begging people take precautions infected household members. still see people saying ""no point keeping diatance definitely already it."") going get groceries? going walk dog? I‚Äôm bars restaurants shopping shit don‚Äôt need pass time. I‚Äôm regular person trying survive 2020 aunt one nurses complete dumb ass. That's generally happens screw minority people. even dramatic that, ICU figures big lag (people stay weeks).

The French lockdown started october 30 around 40,000 cases/day. One week later cases peaked 50,000/day... One month later we're back 10,000. effect really dramatic, reflected ICU deaths many weeks still. remotely compute. Whose lives depressing feel need go daily 1.5 years? manage get there. sure still continues, least considerable amount time, hard limits number arrivals per day many people fit, often flights denied last moment. think fact reimpose lockdown would clue conspiracy theory part brain isnt true. Christmas gonna blast That‚Äôs fucking pathetic. stupid you? 
   
Just clear, consider 2nd least deadly month 
in entire history good enough evidence good job?       
         
How one? 50% drop 2 weeks good enough you? citizen's lives

Citation needed. I've sheltering past seven months without issue. nope, hospital bed saturation point previously like today. entirely foreseeable result everyone went pubs bars restaurants large numbers infection rates went back up. üôÑ No. 5 minute virtual dr appointment, got charged exactly much 1 hour plus person appointment.

How possible? would need way ensure sterility, you‚Äôll leftover traces covid-19 create false positive next device costs &lt;$100

Yes, similar disposable bio chips cost $50-$100. far know pfizer moderna vaccines checking prevented severe illness. Oxford checking regularly (weekly biweekly iirc) see people got regular testing well testing symptoms. Oxford might enough data predict vaccine sterlizing immunity prevent severe illness.

also important vaccines prevent **transmission**. vacciness illnesses still get illness shed virus get severely ill.

if one first batch vacciness unable prevent transmission still mask around waiting vaccinated never due health. 

Hopefully one 100+ development wiil prevent transmission even milld asymptomatic illness people mild symptoms still effects. way. !remindme 4 weeks passport shows long term cells Covid? could get behind one said go out.

(I‚Äôm kidding, I‚Äôve read nothing either way science behind changing ‚Äî hope ‚Äî- way several actually published, peer reviewed study, that‚Äôs all) nurse ratched would contractually bargain make mandatory Dr. Mike also one tools parroting ""don't wear mask"" nonsense surgeon general claiming beginning physicians saying makes sense scientific perspective. get parroting CDC seriously physician need actually use critical thinking abilities. Especially since he's NY/NJ area doctor, telling people kinda thing lot harm good. Let‚Äôs make anything here. Cosmetic surgeons plastic surgery trained, ENT entirely different specialty residency. specialties medical knowledge public thinks, nobody specialties manages vent settings, knows prone patients, manages pressors like intensivists do. served plates rather buffet style. least outside. Denton county Texas past that. Many hospitals plus 15% capacity, meaning 115%. wish best health care workers are/ going experience burn out. reason waiting tell them?

I‚Äôm seriously curious people like this. justify?

There's additional funding schools make safe.

Our schools closed since March year. plan opening back January. even understand logic. changed anything schools help mitigate virus, coronavirus surge unreal right now, rate case counts make March April look like blip.

I see sending kids school point helps anyone. They've gone long, months hurt. keep using words like ‚Äúmay‚Äù know ‚Äúwill‚Äù? love guy, needs stop pussyfooting around forceful word choice. 

How this? ‚ÄúIf change behavior NOW, see massive surges coming weeks. last chance make lives slightly less convenient help save thousands lives. Stop snowflake, wear mask.‚Äù wonder won‚Äôt get approved caused cases rise lot California? That's called challenge trial. yes, would good way test. problem ethics. Since 100% treatment covid morally gray area. plenty volunteers it, getting approval run trials happened (in US). ‚ÄòDefund‚Äô nurses collectively? literally idea you‚Äôre talking don‚Äôt think either - offence. u/taste_the_thunder point though. perfect solution might well nothing fix problem. Let‚Äôs hope goes away itself. Pretty sure it. I've extremely careful washing hands every time touch something wearing n95 mask public. relatives gave mom think mom gave me. room someone infected taking mask eat drink enough get it. Tested negative rapid waiting pcr results. Symptoms low grade fever, headaches, body aches, difficulty sleeping, light cough, difficulty drinking water, stuffy throat. feel overall pretty awful. fever like years get flu shots every year think that. Also, question accuracy rapid tests uncle tested negative around positive cousin went back days later tested positive. People taking masks smell candles store? Lmao ‚Äúworks like dream‚Äù. don‚Äôt like vaccines advertised like used cars sales lot. Narrator: didn't. like ignore everything else focused ""no."" tell plan teachers efficient. Here's latest case/death charts Maricopa county, running 7-day ares spiking again, far deaths following suit.

Maricopa currently 90.27 deaths per 100k, far US per capita average 80.03. ranks Maricopa #1001 among US counties per capita read results vaccine test showed receiving placebo well receiving vaccine. 

How ethical let people go lives thinking may vaccine, come Covid possibly die, letting someone agree Covid injected science testing vaccine controlled environment considered unethical? that's great 3 vaccine manufactures would really good might able get general population quicker. reading dont know get moderna vaccine still infected covid spread it. wonder people get vaccine still experience symptoms encounter covid-19 wild. virus would spread considerable amount way vacccine obviously stop. Makes wonder large enough viral load could lead brain problems even someone vaccine. would obviously super small percentage people something consider people maybe relatives experiencing brain problems. doctors honest, remember human like profession, honest especially desperate.

You always get second opinion dealing medical procedures diagnoses, however, important really make sure now.

Many people undergo lots procedures soon dishonest doctors dentists. 

Be careful there. Right? deciding now? Well, new Oklahoma Health Department guideline nurses go work positive asymptotic covid case see getting even worse state. would risk getting physical going doctor knowing anyone working could positive. goes getting routine teeth cleaning. New glasses wait another 6 months. vet masked vet assistant come car retrieve dog picking vet meds. bring car. vets service though. Study study shown surface spread virtually non-existent. You‚Äôll fine reminded Zapp Branigan quote, perfectly sums US approach COVID: ""So sent wave wave men them!"" problem seeing? statement seems worded properly clear like three vaccines no, defund nurses can‚Äôt guarantee 100% follow protocol. here. I'm Seoul tightening restrictions, however \~540 people died far, unlike America get worse there. want sound bad taste folks claim everything power get got it

Maybe people who've gotten sick since May, early messages place often contradictory hard apply comment people got sick May. don‚Äôt realize virus evenly distributed across country really bad thing? Like, literally worst case scenario, people getting sick everywhere exactly time. CDCs infection rate estimates true (~8x many recorded) question we'll almost heard immunity know. 8x would mean 30% population infected now. potential winter surge early roll vaccines could 60%+ vaccine even widely distributed. think it'll significant issue, plausible people go second dose. everyone rational. I've heard evidence minorities spreading covid faster White's I'd curious coming from. No. Sometimes people careful trying family. always black white. older family can't sit alone months end without anyone them. health decline rapidly get depressed. best choice sometimes distance much possible try see distancing. still get contact traced that. smart ones study medicine become doctors. There's reason there's difference two groups. dad, doctor, used describe bell curve.

(Now feel guilty declined free re-licensing state offered. retired figured old fart pandemic bad idea.) Americans learn even death?

Probably not. I'm boat friend. times tough, rely friends cope. nature virus makes impossible. Knowing need make vaccine makes easier. That's end date, though know yet, light end long dark tunnel. live üòä Social distancing bearly even thing March. Thank this. say already 2 occasions contact tracing greatly benefitted family. First man worked dad started showing symptoms called immediately dad told mom get kids today. also going go see grandmother day, too. next day started showing symptoms tested positive couple days later. get anyone else infected knowledge.

On another occasion, recently, cousin attended funeral went gathering (outside) found people funeral tested positive quarantined anyone else could catch her. mild symptoms. all, 4 family funeral tested positive mild asymptomatic. cluster could lot worse. 

The point long rambling contact tracing absolutely works important. think one cares anymore, attest people taking contact tracing seriously, even lax social distancing. expect significant issue, plausible least people go second dose. something radically wrong science superceded marketing results manner inconsistent good scientific reporting. anyone else see problem statement ...

"" 196 volunteers contracted COVID-19 trial 30,000 people, 185 received placebo 11 got vaccine. Moderna reported 30 severe cases - placebo group - means vaccine 100 per cent effective preventing severe cases.

LITERAL EXPERT: ""The vaccine widely available spring""

REDDITOR: ""Very unlikely, good sir. considered ... LOGISTICS?""

LITERAL EXPERT: ""Yes."" side effects real, sometimes long even life long. friend died flu vaccine prevent flu strains werent going around season.  

Finding studies prove vaccines good wont happen need heavily funded cooperation needs occur. Imagine product independent group funded wants pay provide products test prove safe. Guess going do? make sure product top shape, polish seem like push ones looking prove product stinks.  

Anytime injecting something body, chemicals 'things', risk body wont able push away.

Hashimoto's disease much common thyroid disease today. becoming known studies vaccine materials get thyroid treated life like threat body bodies immune system constantly attacks thyroid causing disease. terrible disease many, yet mysterious growing exponentially.  

I think learn hubris group think going look rather short sided downright foolish less ten years. better techniques available else diminish stock big pharma.

So yea call anti vaxer, im anti GMO, anti chemicals foods (many outlawed countries US put kids cereal).  prefer trust, verify healthy dose skepticism knowing people ANYTHING buck, INCLUDING one corrupt industries world medical field. I'm saying Cuomo good job. I'm fan either. culpable. national leadership MIA nationwide response could stopped become clusterf*ck. 

NY alone total mismanagement situation. states still allowing things counterproductive. 

Who wanted downplay this?

Who shut Euro flights, many came New York, late?

Who coordinate state governors create national containment plan?

Who dismantled pandemic response team?
Who refused even listen scientists put forth ludicrous ideas?

There enough blame go around. you, thank you. need mindful say things going forward. can't source it.  assumption basis reason.  may totally bogus.  

Let also say seen experts, especially TV, say lot things know turned true.  Remember fomites wiping groceries bleach water?  

Apparently experts experts.  know early especially heard lots speculation experts virus based viruses considered similar.  think speculation lack immunity infection came from. 

All know heard accounts large scale reinfections even places high rates first wave like Italy NYC.   maybe year will. say third world country. Pfizer two plants making COVID-19 vaccine, one Kalamazoo, Michigan, one **Puurs, Belgium.**

Misinformation much? Please redirect studies sticky subreddit front page! ~200 people gotten virus trial. get 40,000 participants test see ones get it, intentionally expose them

what describing challenge trial, think astrazeneca think really downplaying 1) training required RN, 2) much potential respiratory infection part RNs area professional experience

In short, think RN dumb covid comparable flat earther flight attendant. gotta pilot know Earth round smoke em got em, got rough estimate us US commoner folk getting vaccines? Maybe I've got trials mixed up, could sworn told people trials actually go shop social distance unlike rest us. meant actually going stores, eating etc (I assume) rest us avoiding much possible. Possibly even maskless would also increase chances. maybe I've got information mixed up. There's like three vaccine trials going honestly tell ifthey exact policy one that. gone gym like year COVID hit, despite paying $10/month. I'm kinda point want go I'm high risk go.

I need exercises knees. resistance bands everything, home way convenient, want work machines gym. described slightly pessimistic. is. Constant over-promising state federal government big part caused pandemic fatigue set fast imo. push goal posts back many times people get annoyed leave stadium. study study study says major source spread. deny science long look ridiculous one forcing go ~~holiday shopping~~ **thanksgiving** pandemic.

FTFY.

It's both, whether chose admit not. Excellent. Reward fatties lack self discipline. That‚Äôll teach  I‚Äôm trial too, think it‚Äôs end 25 month trial period. drop time get real vaccine, won‚Äôt know got active placebo trial. live many dealerships we're $0 down, 0% interest, 0 payments 6 months. 6 months I'm betting people bought able make first payments. Sure see surge barely used cars market pretty soon. little bit, thank sharing view fleshing me! mean expect happen? Honestly, aren‚Äôt listening now, will, never, ever, ever listen..ohooo... would relevant every country testing capacity criteria reporting cases. would go, imagine many people will. I'm super ready over, regardless cost. even possible vaccine roll So? I've already got shit-ton IDs - need one drive, one fly, one get Costco - cares add one list? overweight definitely factor. People BMI 30 higher much likely develop asthma. 

The interesting thing BMI high, also much less likely respond asthma medications like inhaled corticosteroids. According ""Obese people asthma worse asthma control treated theophylline, drug used therapy asthma relaxes bronchial smooth muscle"" well. getting healthy weight fixes that. Studies show lung function improves obese asthma patients lose weight. 1. RNA vaccines don‚Äôt alter genetic code. aren‚Äôt ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù conspiracy bullshit rabbit hole purporting. safer don‚Äôt contain virus parts like old-fashioned vaccines made eggs. way cheaper faster mass produce. instruct cell produce marker Covid outer shell immune system recognize encounters Covid. vaccine gone. 
2. Despite admittedly somewhat deserved bad rep ‚Äúpharma‚Äù gets, despite law suits, aren‚Äôt monolith. hire thousands scientists. consist people. dedicate lives careers mitigating horrific diseases outbreaks. working asses off, regulators, producers, them. best friend whole wide world one them. went grad school together. science shit. wouldn‚Äôt hesitate blow whistle hard shady shit happening Covid vaccine R&amp;D. 
3. Fuck spreading fear. federal government also begin publicity campaign encourage vaccinations, ads radio week TV soon, said.

This started months ago. Honestly, surprised scheduled appointments keep people swarming locations, least early months this. Gathering bunch panicky, tired, stressed people one place likely limited number vaccinations day sounds like recipe disaster imo. consulting firm who, among things, helps businesses understand broader landscape preparation positive readouts vaccine trials mean United States likely reach epidemiological end pandemic (herd immunity) Q3 Q4 2021.""*

You explicitly said ""2022 2023."" Nothing provided supports assertion. article talking Models predict US requiring keep taking precautions 2022 (Admittedly, simulations probably little obsolete run May 2020).

Effectively worthless light research events since time. fully take consideration potential slowdowns happen due distribution problems.

This crux problem posts. idly speculating possibility 'slowdowns' pressed say believe ""vehicle breakdowns incompetent drivers"" significantly impact speed roll out, - someone involved logistics - nonsense. Even ""punctured cooler"" would negligible impact overall vaccination timeline.  talking hear talk. There's always gonna careless people give f. true feel affected virus slightest. Best thing vaccine many people possible Statically speaking it‚Äôs rarity, trend plus people can‚Äôt get natural immunity vaccine would useless since that‚Äôs purpose point anyone believes hoax go grave way. Good bot. dad would laughed that. unnecessary....fuck county hell would give elderly. Lock homes give mobile, contributing people. Elderly get last. watch murder wrote wait Well doesn‚Äôt make sense since cigarette smokers hospitalized lesser rate compared rest population.

Nicotine suppresses immune system. probably makes easier contract virus. ince smoker it, body trigger insanely aggressive immune response causing people hospitalized.

That‚Äôs theory. studies UK South Korea claiming smokers underrepresented among hospitalized covid patients. 69? Nice. 

I bot lol. Yeah, delay routine medical care. Doctors way better masking others. lost 69 year old father covid. stayed home much possible. got regular pneumonia, go hospital, got covid, died 10 days later.

Let pops know dad biker, overall badass, end, strap hi. bed panic attacks ripping O2 mask. died hospit bed, strange person know, mother able hug anyone also positive.

Your fathers actions terrible implications himself, also all. one go shit. ??? i'm sure anyone's reddit comment going change anything priority gets vaccine. understand, must comfortable life money pressing issue you, ""circle jerk,"" reality many americans facing right poor struggling feed ourselves, whilst country continues prioritize comfort wellbeing rich. get pedestal, arbiter conversation. absolutely right, trial could altered behavior. me, mild side effects, I‚Äôm unsure group I‚Äôm in. personally would cavalier even fairly sure vaccinated results released recently. vaccine could useless. XD else supposed share holiday cheer?? Sounds like need help understanding RNA...

Article: hope helps people! UK still chicken pox parties, reason vaccine, believe disease rarely kills? shock little pay is, mean work, form work better none guess age 27, met Navy fitness standards obviously

45% asymptomatic

1.7% hospitalized

0.3% ICU

0.1% died

Peacetime hospitalization standards much different wartime, however. clear denying 90% people hospital bed would caused additional deaths. think safe say anti vaxers line proven effective alternative dire vaccines proven countless times cause pertains side effects items still studied squashed.  friend die flu vaccine. healthy person. flu vaccine absolutely ZERO ability stop flu strains going around year, yet forced take employer.  children sued employer wasnt hard.

I wouldnt call anti vaxer certainly wouldnt subject family vaccines dubious intent effectiveness. case, covid concerns outweigh potential side effects however 'wait awhile' like many others see others.

95% effective, says large pharma stands make billions (or least regain losses research dev this. exactly tested? tried search limited time came empty continue. test 95% fact 100 people 5 got covid? Well that's actually good number participants social distancing, wearing masks, avoiding going etc like everyone else (or be). 5 people 100 business caught covid even though everything supposed to, co workers would demanding safer work conditions right? vaccine worth taking potential unknown side effects. new type vaccine regardless others would suggest. Yeah, got glimpse two weeks ago, that's market reacted. market kind expecting good news think misstatement / misquote. would make lot sense talking total number cases (cumulative) 1/3 population. now. thought studies used much viral material half million positive people touched surface. understand fomite risk minimal.

Thanks much kind wordsüíú

Edit: would add people, even know know went through, still act stupid ways sometimes. think majority people won‚Äôt go symptoms bad did. lot people will, majority, can‚Äôt fully fathom it, still questionable things. It‚Äôs unfortunate people touch fire know it‚Äôs hot, sort thing. mean lets honest, U.S probably one countries got hit hard actually testing much is. dont doubt Iran India getting similarly whalloped arent testing reporting nearly reliably

This addition per capita point  counting presumptive cases that, due symptoms, tested detected?

Almost certainly. There's way testing capacity would ever able keep even million positives per day. source this? I‚Äôm seeing experts still say don‚Äôt know sure much immunity built infection. way 11 196 gets p value 0.15 Super bowl parties far away new years either Pardon ignorance, long take new vaccine show results introduced general public? You‚Äôre absolutely right. kind volunteer trial it‚Äôs horrible longer us.  Omg can‚Äôt believe forgot that. It‚Äôll great way finish shit year.  Really? knew?

Part chickenpox adult dangerous, less annoyance kid. I‚Äôm bud. 
This holier thou stuff really toxic. county's numbers show teachers school employees testing positive 3 times general population. Students general population. I'm sure asymptomatic spread big contributor.

I'm definitely anti-mask person. saying situations masks truly uncomfortable. 

## Abstract

Background: effect SARS-CoV-2 mutations viral load severity COVID-19 well understood. possibility reinfection SARS-CoV-2 already reported, dual infection SARS-CoV-2 poorly described currently discussion. describe study two strains SARS-CoV-2 detected patient disease presentation. Methods: Two nasopharyngeal swabs obtained eight days apart patient 90s, diagnosed lobar pneumonia (J18.1). tests positive SARS-CoV-2 high viral load (Ct = 13). performed high-throughput sequencing SARS-CoV-2 genomes swabs. Findings: Genomic analysis SARS-CoV-2 revealed presence two genetically distant strains swabs. Detected strains belong different phylogenetic clades (GH GR) differ seven nucleotide positions. relative abundance strains 70% (GH) 30% (GR) first swab, 3% (GH) 97% (GR). Interpretation: findings suggest patient infected two genetically distinct SARS-CoV-2 strains time. One possible explanations second infection occurred hospital. Change dominant strain ratio disease manifestation could explained advantage higher virulence strain belonging clade GR. Vaccine supposed widespread April experts guess normalcy back around time.next year  lol Yeah live WA (high taxes too) part done well virus. Governor Inslee trying best tell people stay home without giving means so? government needs tell people job stay home give money so. far early inject kind vaccines imo. Sure may prevent COVID time I'll rather wait safe side remarkable. need force anti-vax dubassess take covid develop multiple strains come back resistant existing vaccines. know many pandemics like covid-19 human society, know it, survive. rushing vaccines out. need trials need much, much careful. Read someone died placebo trial. Around April vaccine wide spread enough people want get it, might back normal woukd doubt see normalcy creeping back next summer actions dialogue say much mental health physical health, incredible leader. Unpopular point view: Florida ranks #23 cases per million population #15 deaths per million, plus Florida higher percentage older population states. 

Could Santis more? course, almost every Governor could. 

The fact Florida handling average end day look stats. Warm weather saving them. 

I‚Äôll take downvotes now. subreddit battle misinformation. Things upvoted downvoted based hive mind's whims. reply accurate answer upvoted lot Monday, yet give information Tuesday yet downvoted hell it. best hope lively interesting discussion. want straight science try /r/covid19. /r/skeptic sometimes deals Covid among many topics. Glasses natural either, better see assholes wearing either.  I'm OP, since looking examples I'll give few. lost business forced close first shutdown. get new job business closed I'm forced wear mask 9+ hours day causing extreme skin irritation acne. brother small time landlord forced maintain tenant upstairs apartment paid rent since May. can't even afford freaking restaurants stop condescending people advocate rights. rights trampled. isn‚Äôt 94% effective always better placebo ? Couldn‚Äôt make safe assumption need 50% sleep tent. keep barrier everyone else booster shot. Theres difference bouncing back worse 2020... government already involved, stop subsidizing meat. industry diversify, i.e. offer plant based options, some, fortunately already Yep, plenty go around here.

The point comment show absurdity anti-pharmaceutical industry sentiments really seem coming everyone planet. guess could‚Äôve bit clear. That's true. lot healthy people horrific, permanent damage Covid. flu, either survive recover, there's actually lot risk healthy people media ignores reason. Vietnam, Australia , New Zealand, Taiwan establish tourism trade zone, would great economies, would give people countries somewhere go. I've wondering Cam Newton! research/studies yet done vaccines immunocompromised individuals? father immunocompromised (CLL) doctors said much whether take vaccine yet... I'm sure mRNA one hypothetically ok since virus I'm loop topic Candyass COVID took true badass. go weak virus, keep mind quite old. take much take 85 yr old honest. I'm talking executing people Wow removed comments lol vaccine going free. Yup, 1 person office test positive almost zero contact everyone sent home till new year, a-ok recluse months avoid shitshow country right Maybe get well soon ballon. Actually, want number infections vaccine arm small possible. 

With 196 total infections, vaccine work all, would 98 infections vaccine arm 98 placebo arm.

If vaccine 100% effective, would see 196 placebo arm, 0 vaccine arm.

At current split (185 placebo vs 11 vaccine), odds vaccine effect less 0.1%. 

So like 170 people would infected get vaccine, did, vaccine prevented it, least prevented symptoms. suspect comment age well. that's whole point Placebo effect; body thinks right tools fight virus, belief starts production antibodies. weird, ""Placebo"" group tests Placebo effect effecitve actual drug. placebo works push drug further. really gross stock prices. Stock prices !! pandemic .  


They incandescent superior AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine job smaller doses, $3-4 per dose, require refrigerated -70C, Moderna Pfizers require - shortage liquid nitrogen. 


I wait superior Oxford vaccine. We‚Äôre allowed enforce Save Lot wok fear termination  We'll see...but data far look good...

Unfortunately data look good states strict lockdowns either. California surging despite strictest measures country. suppose question is, virus vaccine, need give placebo group fake vaccine? Can‚Äôt upfront? Tell won‚Äôt receiving vaccine part control group?

I understand something like migraine heart disease. Still really understanding point placebo vaccine Huh!? tf possible? Fauci saying April.  Absolutely right, monoclonals here.

Up now, rich, privileged, want something immediately, them, monoclonals became available, going convalescent plasma. them, matter ""choosing gets it."" get want it, concierge physician concierge home urgent care center. Evidence good them, study earlier administration would helped. Now, academic. far know, encourage people part trials intentionally increase chances exposure. would wildly unethical. lived life differently result participation, choice. Well live EU, live US. first dose likely already effect. Either reduced symptoms immunity least part vaccinated. There‚Äôs probably enough data specific vaccines yet that‚Äôs generally works. booster gives longer immunity. suprised Packes avoided COVID 19 part, except two players get it, AJ Dillon one player. wonder would happen Rodgers ended getting it? forward-looking statements summary FAQ neither promises guarantees, place undue reliance forward-looking statements involve known unknown risks, uncertainties, factors, many beyond Moderna‚Äôs control could cause actual results differ materially expressed implied forward-looking statements. risks, uncertainties, factors include, among others: fact never commercial product utilizing mRNA technology approved use; fact rapid response technology use Moderna still developed implemented; risks uncertainties described heading ‚ÄúRisk Factors‚Äù Moderna‚Äôs recent Annual thank God every day live New York, high taxes all. least we're trying something contain spread virus. group people don‚Äôt follow instructions don‚Äôt trust authorities need die? aunt still suffers post polio syndrome. got 50s, right vaccine became widespread. fun. ""I stop smoking 20 cigarettes day others smoke 60!"" wanted bolster push comment farther up. We're currently nearly enough testing trust current confirmed cases good picture total number infections. evidences astronomical positivity rates states across country - adequate testing positivity rate around 5%.

Because deficiency experts widespread agreement current daily totals last months massive undercounts. such, confirmed cases totals giving sort close-up much larger picture spread. reliable metrics hospitalizations, deaths, specifically [excess deaths compared previous problem large now, daily new case numbers necessarily representative true scale spread. Sorry, mistake news literally making smile ass off. I'm ready life go back normal!  Source: Trust bro ""one dinner"". also travelling, long distances public transit planes. also spending way longer shops. Also correlation people things taking steps ensure safety. That's why. non-American way country actively resisted minimising spread baffling. Vaccines also going get approved EU time. also disagree prioritizing elderly, unless work like young people do. Many though, get people get choice stay home? nursing homes, yes, live independently avoid virus easily us. Uh yeah I‚Äôll give five bucks u find Fauci saying it‚Äôs fine go Black Friday shopping. won‚Äôt. Dude wants us home. Atlas lunatics undermining whenever course. guess virus‚Äô side. 

## Abstract

**Introduction** Australia recorded first case COVID-19 late January 2020. 22P March 2020, amid increasing daily case numbers, Australian Government implemented lockdown restrictions help ‚Äòflatten curve‚Äô. study aimed understand impact lockdown restrictions sexual reproductive health. focus sexual practices.

**Methods** online survey open 23PP April 2020 11P May 2020. Participants recruited online via social media networks asked report sexual practices 2019 lockdown. Logistic regression used calculate difference (diff) (including 95% CIs) proportion sex practices time periods.

**Results** 1187 commenced survey, 965 (81.3%) completed it. Overall, 70% female 66.3% aged 18‚Äì29 years. (53.5%) reported less sex lockdown 2019. Compared 2019, participants likely report sex spouse (35.3% vs 41.7%; diff=6.4%; 95%‚ÄâCI 3.6 9.2) less likely report sex girl/boyfriend (45.1% vs 41.8%; diff=‚àí3.3%; 95%‚ÄâCI ‚àí7.0 -0.4) casual hook-up (31.4% vs 7.8%; 95%‚ÄâCI ‚àí26.9 -19.8). Solo sex activities increased; 14.6% (123/840) reported using sex toys often 26.0% (218/838) reported masturbating often. Dating app use decreased lockdown compared 2019 (42.1% vs 27.3%; diff= ‚àí14.8%; 95%‚ÄâCI ‚àí17.6 -11.9). Using dating apps chatting/texting (89.8% vs 94.5%; diff=4.7%; 95%‚ÄâCI 1.0 8.5) setting virtual dates (2.6% vs 17.2%; diff=14.6%; 95%‚ÄâCI 10.1 19.2) increased lockdown.

**Conclusion** Although significant declines sexual activity lockdown reported, people completely stop engaging sexual activities, highlighting importance ensuring availability normal sexual reproductive health services global emergencies. Ezekeal Elliot? notied got COVID 19, running back year. Suprised brought year. Lamar Jackson ends damage? Maybe, there's huge gap Murphy's worthless actions like closing indoor dining 10PM shutting whole economy. one thing could actually start enforcing rules. Nobody pays attention gathering limits quarantine protocols. Start breaking parties arresting people. would second one need administered, would happen know?
Link isn‚Äôt working apologies mentioned article weren‚Äôt even playing..? lose stated personally doing? child house anymore.""

This unfair. People legitimately worried children's education. biggest predictor whether school US went person year [the color People children districts already showing opportunity gaps seeing widen. mean people necessarily support children going back endangers community. really tired seeing everyone accusing parents wanting babysitters wanting kids sight. Wow. Scary sure. Tell us too. Several things.

Whether good season, flu shot is, fact, vaccine. vaccine covers limited number influenza virus mutations expected prevalent corresponding season. significant number flu infections prevented vaccine, nature influenza prevents effective would desired.

Influenza virus quite unstable mutates rapidly.

SARS-CoV-2 gene sequencing far suggests mutates far slowly and, thus far, ways impact immune response targets.

It remains seen whether SARS-CoV-2 endemic US areas world. Similar Coronaviruses died past. (SARS, MERS essentially gone.)

They're yet certain long vaccines COVID-19 provide protection. time frame pandemic coupled low rate reinfection suggests even natural immunity 1 year greater, time tell. think people assume they're testing vaccine exposing people virus rather comparing catch own. Ya fuck though, let loud idoits drag mood. think funny, check prices RV parking spaces. make bank got hold those. Elderly working contributing different 80 year old tending garden. may love shouldn‚Äôt move front line  Next reading list, Thomas Kuhn's Structure Scientific Revolutions, see people always ignore comments like yours. wanna get back life haha Oh completely agree. Really awful Trump goonies unknown reason decided go ""deny obfuscate"" approach. required public decide trust, e.g. Fauci respected professionalls Trump band idiots. Unfortunately us huge part population believes Trump jesus 2.0 something Wait... asked antibody test show past infection, PCR test shows active infection? makes zero sense. sure misunderstanding antibody/PCR testing? know people got sick March still positive antibodies. Maybe follow ask explanation antibody test, shows past infection someone recovered from, would matter. Get explain thought process, future reference. double stupidity, maybe ask think previously sick Covid got better, untouchable class. CDC guideline 10 days people longer infectious. Even people get Covid vaccine start becoming among test positive antibodies. stupid scheme hold people start getting vaccinated? So, data lag, cases winding Wisconsin, people smartened up? work company runs clinical trials participants always compensated. I'm sure talking about. Who‚Äôs that? one here. know get vaccine, they'll behave differently people got vaccine, skew results. They'd fewer infections they'd careful average.

If no-one knows got vaccine placebo, groups equally careful, compare better. know, yet submitted FDA approval MRHA EMA. One research said 4 weeks, 40% people reported complete recovery, 40% reported partial recovery, 20% reported recovery. I'll see dig link. negative control needs included comparison. alternative placebo would injection making study unblinded. Someone control group knows receive vaccine might take precautions someone received vaccine. confounding effect messing data. Additionally, side effects could psychological result injecting liquid arm. placebo group helps account that. pound dry beans costs $1.29 (in pricey southern california less) feed family 4 2 3 days.

Bananas 15 cents piece. 5 lb bag carrots costs $3. Rolled oats $1 pound.

Healthy food expensive. Yes! hope! =) That‚Äôs true. I‚Äôm trying say pandemic isn‚Äôt serious personally never got sick. trying encourage others live similar lifestyle me. 

Hopefully didn‚Äôt spread it. also could say thing infectious disease I‚Äôve contracted throughout life. feel lucky I‚Äôve able keep mental health tact continuing things love. Bruh u good? Shouldn‚Äôt even come question. wish everyone would shut get it. early April year, researchers warned potential wave neurological illness caused covid-19, mostly based knew past pandemics viral infections like flu.

So something happens many viral infections. 

It would however explain latest US election results. issue get go. Closing never option. Wearing freaking mask reality others cannot much protect others even really tried. incudes government well. one else trusted relied upon protect health. plan broke much would cost 25 stores enact grocery pickup system comes extra payroll, admin email accessible mobile device hard drives/code make ‚Äúordering portal.‚Äù type test use? wish could send every person says ‚Äúonly sick people need stay home.‚Äù course didn't. might require challenge views change opinion wrong. Yep. Behavior would confounding variable here. Good you. school district 2 schools close due explosion cases. We've couple teachers die, special ed student die, ""covid tracker"" always suspiciously way behind numbers confirmed teacher text group threads, etc.

And perhaps large public highschool campus accommodate distance needs, ventillation needs, staffing needs, etc COVID demands. Perhaps others not. 

It seems attempting dismiss /u/TheRatKingXIV's response weaponizing anecdote; shitfest handling COVID school setting demonstrated everywhere, anecdote- however true might fortunate school- change fact.

In way, pretty much proving /u/TheRatKingXIV's point *general systemic coldness.* He/she tries bring compassion conversation, soon thereafter account comes along state cold anecdote. always way people beginning notice *critical mass* sort-of way. reproducible enough almost painfully obvious heartless system truly is. have:

- made responses /r/shitliberalssay parrot conservative attitudes terms COVID/lockdowns/its-not-that-bad/etc.

- use lmfao emotionally condescending remarks frequently (the hallmark cold dismissive behavior)

- condescendingly ask person trolling person mentally disabled (neither question- they're insults)

- Mention going avoid visiting family due disease 99.9% survival rate

Etc etc etc. 7 day old account. shit different indifferent redditor. Lord mercy  shopping Black Friday, reason totally ok ""experts"".

""Politicians,"" mean. know credible experts ""totally OK"" in-person Black Friday shopping. People shockingly bad statistics. Come on. Uk/ireland surrounded water well. Could easily shut place properly well. Though might permitted 100% strict adherence advice public health officials, seems like normal life without mask requirements (possibly excluding potential superspreader events like fully packed stadiums) justifiably resume *you* immunized low-priority group. risk levels go dramatically high-risk groups immunized death hospitalization rates collapse. data? make announcements investors. Same! mean 450 still morbidly obese height. US done POOR job handling this. Fauci Biden heroes right now. Yes company‚Äôs financial performance never shared outside store‚Äôs leadership team. maybe would see rest regions monthly sales that‚Äôs it. store designed literally competitive ‚Äúisland.‚Äù worries. Wish type caution used everywhere. Even though they‚Äôre finding temp checks kind bs comes knowing someone carrying virus them. forgot panic attack nearly passing didn‚Äôt realize haven‚Äôt taken breath last 2 minutes standing line Thalidomide.  UCSF study lung damage (not necessarily cancer) associated marijuana vs tobacco.

The authors seem think major factor cigarette smokers smoke like 20 cigs/day, whereas pot smokers smoke like 1 joint/week so. makes perfect sense me. Certainly *almost nobody* going able smoke amount pot day comparable average tobacco user smokes. studies done companies producing vaccine (though practice contract actual hands-on work organizations experience running clinical trials). data examined couple different groups equivalent international counterparts country they're seeking approval. Yea hospitals doomed... Umm laws books many countries seeing surges well... 

Even idiots right idiots consenting idiots, founding principal freedom.

Laws prison time would disproportionately affect low income individuals families... net positive society inn industry call ""removing friction"" lmao honesty cannot fathom would emotional discussion all. family everyone understood much risk missing one Christmas big deal. Maybe wake call getting triggered  tho? really strange people think American's want ""leader free world"". hell good us? Sounds expensive. literally works around people sick choose.not gomto.the hospital. like bartender avoid. Didn‚Äôt read then. know flu strains sometimes referred things like H1N1 H3N2? Flu viruses couple different surface proteins (Hemagglutinin Neuraminidase often discussed) protein number different subtypes. someone infected two different flu strains, genes proteins reassort form new virus kind like viral breeding. mutation rate flu also high. result, flu high amount diversity. best vaccinate virus strains think circulate.

Coronavirus hand reproduces like cloning. There's exchange data special proof reading enzyme lowers mutation rate greatly.

There on-going work trying develop universal flu vaccine targeting conserved regions virus. Lol..I already do, except 2 shopping trips month less depending finances Avoid reposting information. country couldn‚Äôt give less fuck

No, care, think real. think giant conspiracy, force everyone convert Islam.  

They think 'patients' hospital actors. sham. 

They think things is't easier believe lies, otherwise would need admit they've duped Republicans Fox News years, ignorant, stupid, like Liberals claiming years. only... Sounds like freaking death cult full operation. wonder why! Lets hope things really improving. know England really improved last weeks, new cases dropping 30 percent. France seen improvement also. seems like important point normal times, Mayo nearly full, said Richard A. Helmers, pulmonologist vice president region‚Äôs hospitals. Mayo brisk business high-end care, including cardiac surgery patients generally follow predictable course. Doctors administrators know they‚Äôll leave, next bed open. Covid-19 patients linger weeks, even month more, complicating effort find space current endless surge sick people.

It's hospital full, also hospital's resources optimized predictable load. assume many hospitals nationwide set way. United Kingdom; landlords currently allowed conduct visitings currently occupied properties? right what? issue lack financial support lockdown, lockdown itself. would better situation lockdown people stop going overwhelmed hospitals effect everyone. It‚Äôs fantasy without lockdown life would better.

Having wear mask doesn‚Äôt trample rights requiring go naked. It‚Äôs nothing rights. That‚Äôs false idea spread people don‚Äôt want support people financially, OK, couple questions here

1) ""draft"" retired doctors? going army? simply say no? Hard make trained professional perform gunpoint.

2) Retired often old right? let's take older people expose them? What's Cuomo going get sick, send retirement homes? learn nothing?  Cool, I'll pass symptoms like? ""thay ain't ingectin' 5G"" I‚Äôm getting whatever Fauci getting.    include seniors? think. handling Covid-19 blazing dumpster fire. taper Autumn 2021 U.S. Hell yeah! I'll line well. What? i'm right. Without vaccine we'll still wearing masks 2030... . pointed typo comment. Oxford seems hit 90% effective half dose followed full dose month later. follow regime rollout. also incidental effect increasing number people able vaccinated since takes 1.5 units per person complete instead two.

Plus stored normal refrigerator temperatures, makes logistics distributing Lot easier. mean, that's great whatever reason either asymptomatic somehow luckiest dude around. millions people lucky, also know asymptomatic spreader might directly indirectly responsible someone's death.  


Doesn't make stop think moment? fatigue that's happening people trying comply relative lockdown safe. Moderate action like mandatory mask compliance would made better everybody, people saying ""It's big deal"" making rest play Russian roulette them. people think BMI 30 bros still pretty fat, pretend squat 4 plates.

I think better pretending people 10% bf BMI 30 exist, outside professional athletes, pretty much don't. article study lists three reasons. first physical: Respiratory allergy associated significant reductions angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors lungs, protein provides entry point COVID-19 hook infect human second sociological: People asthma likely suffer severe cases COVID-19. such, said Merzon, likely adhere Health Ministry instructions, including wearing masks, social distancing maintaining good treatment asthma inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) could reduce likelihood getting virus. chance it'll sooner? Hope so. bodies store fat easier others, means work harder mantain lower BMI, would suggest intermittent fasting cutting cabs half lung tar acting internal mask, reducing viral load  really calling individual freedom man abstract principal? seriously makes sick... camrade cousin Vinny works vaccine manufacturing plant said take vaccine yet produced robots humans. get $20 squirrels? Pretty calm, friend. long time prepare. yes, see future mostly preventable. response pathetic top keeping info quiet public didn‚Äôt want scare us, quoted. Moderna's press Grade 3 (severe) events greater equal 2% frequency first dose included injection site pain (2.7%), second dose included fatigue (9.7%), myalgia (8.9%), arthralgia (5.2%), **headache (4.5%)**, pain (4.1%) erythema/redness injection site (2.0%). solicited adverse events generally short-lived. count in!  Well, need put money mouth is. like taking vaccine that's rushed, expert like Fauci says worth risk, I'm going take knowledge gut. U.S. ? took coward's way

Nah, much worse this. purposefully acted way did: drunk feeling halls power. knew willing say Trump wanted say, she'd get take Fauci's place daily White House meetings. believe placebos testing non psychological diseases. either got hit truck didn't. know I'm minority make sense me. Thank talking people‚Äòs actions directly leading deaths hundreds thousands. Deep South city here. 

Spring averaged paltry 20-30 cases day. Summer around 60-70 day. Fall close 120 150 busy day.

This afternoon's report? 320. Yesterday 315. Saturday 340. anything go high enough given folks I've seen  Think difficulty generating initial response rather second shot booster genuinely say anyone thinks 15% population going immune Xmas - know responded wrong person initially - needs get Facebook. would minorities second group get it? probably sole reason medical caregivers death rates high wait long enough sure. Right ask Flucelvax Walgreens since data looked good might offer slightly flu protection. picky since widely available. assume beginning probably going take whatever available though since knows long wait preferred choice. I'd rather partial protection none all. one pfizer one 100%, even says title disagree, one makes feel personally attacked. I'm going say column see in, little unnerving accurate is.

The image posted much better representation I've saved future reference. Thanks! Evil Jew /s think that's mis-construing information. Correct, US one worst responses. size EU EU seemed handled better. However last month so, cold weather dramatically changed case loads even countries. larger install base bad leadership gaslighting ignorant people, however virus clearly changed tracks weather started hitting around 60 degrees F many countries restrictions go place. higher death per capita places cases per capita, growth trajectory many locations mirrors weird escalation saw nations, nations seem still better protocols adoptions citizens. performance virus back Average citizen country, politics damned, everyone Nation decided cautious time, would mess. that's point politicians, coordinate responses put place enforcements policies. paper it?  elect him. first election governor. put position former elected governor resigned affair scandal. 

Edit: missouri awesome picking elected officials. Let‚Äôs see, killer airborne virus meets population 50% people think it‚Äôs fake virus, flu hoax.  could possibly go wrong? app getting contract workers help perform evictions called Civvl People like thousands died this. 

""i'm going report FaMiLy cOmEs fIrST!!!"" pattern Bergamo vs. surrounding areas, parts Stockholm affected spring. least affected now. controversial point herd immunity affecting spread point. appreciate well thought response. thoughts:

- mention -70 means dry ice handled professionals. Please underestimate reality that:
 - Dry ice always readily available. realize hospitals copious access, vary heavily resources area. instance, realize consumer perspective, northeast, get dry ice suppliers limited hours limited staff. Southeast, get dry ice Publix. 
 - Professionals vary well jobs, course, they're limited resource too. see norm, anticipate things like people deal tough situations, maybe handling things less ideal way (how many rural pharmacies going try prolong shelf life vaccine using breakroom freezer?). 

I want come ""gloom doom"" - we've got real end nightmare sight - know reality, end right around corner many people anticipate. ran things perfectly ideally, 100% efficient, great distribution handling, think August 2021 would return perfect normalcy. Unfortunately, minor issues (and please know I'm pointing minor issues), likely slow down. Oh really üôÉ That‚Äôs submit data FDA. know right? FDA review peer review? 100% protection severe really true? like ultimate umbrella regardless rains? suck hard family. Knowing 50/50 shot got wrong side. Let's go basics vaccine research works.

30,000 people given injections, told might vaccine might placebo, go home behave exactly vaccinated all, keep masking distancing not. Neither volunteers researchers know got vaccine vs placebo, data recorded accessible independent third party. volunteer receive regular phone calls monitor symptoms, become symptomatic Covid get swabbed. number infections recorded. 

Over time, 196 people found infected. people infected. number high enough meet pre-established requirements. point, independent independent third party allowed reveal majority infections happened placebo group. vaccine work all, find 196 infections, would expect 90 vaccine group 90 placebo group. probability 185 vs 11 breakdown less 0.1% vaccine work. strong evidence vaccine working. True. I‚Äôm personally aiming statement true regardless.

It might also take good chunk 2021 vaccinate whoever wants vaccination.

All I‚Äôm saying one actually knows sure exact month day able get enough vaccinations us live without social distancing, masks, restrictions. 

Of course gradual. course. exactly long?  Probably sometime end next year safest thing think say right now.  Well that's point. concern putting immune system overdrive stem virus, necessarily vaccine. Lmao okay buddy addressing obesity pandemic never priority because....you know....fat shaming bad....gluttony body positivity good. pisses released statement Thanksgiving; way little, way late.  
One case people would listen already know, need hear it, WON'T, won't. bunch people went got tested ahead Thanksgiving. Babysitters get paid better. Makes feel less shit weight loss plan lose 70 pounds 32% way done 11 months. Definitely anxious, stressed, self critical even able lose much need life literally risk (and feedback turn led stress eating less progress). agree this. saying must open would better least K-5. Like said, agree done pretty awful job. There's literally vaccine 95% effectiveness days FDA approval. 

Why would resigned this?? rather get ill recover unless end life threatening symptoms

So basically... risk death avoid risk side effects?

Makes sense.. 30k, presumably 15k people received real vaccine. That‚Äôs 15k live experiments answer questions ‚Äúis vaccine safe? side effects?‚Äù That‚Äôs extremely useful. came say literally laughed loud username. Love permanent damage incurred judged months. agree tactical mistake lying protect stockpiles. reasonable Republicans talked quote ad nauseum asked listening experts. said, CDC Dr. Fauci lied _once_ good reason, Administration lied every day, folks still believe latter. mistake, would outcome normal political times opinion. sure value assumption divided assumption. So, since takes 70% reach herd immunity 350k years end, that‚Äôs 800k total dead, depending long takes vaccine deployed. absolutely correct. first explosive spreading event northeast happened, testing limited already hospitalized. live NJ know many people get tested sick enough admitted ER. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, pretty much everyone suspicious sniffle get tested, though lines wait times steadily creeping even here. going potentially get point amount testing supplies staff hit limits see case counts plateau/ go result, indicative what's really going on.  question definition of, ""essential employees"" using? ""shutdown"" amazingly 90% stores considered ""essential"". Privilege comparing staying home solitary confinement. People world much, much worse you. ""10 14 days now..."" mantra entire time since march. 

So, another 10-14 days see explosive growth Thanksgiving travel, time Christmas. 

We already cancelled decided Zoom Christmas family year. 2 daughters absolute champs, understand cant anything ""sick people"". Traditionally 20-30 people Christmas Morning in-laws. past thanksgiving first time since kids alive stayed home thanksgiving Happy hear this. went Wisconsin two weeks ago. screening, wear masks, clean patients. get sick. Went April well. problematic teeth risk worth me. drag, case I'm...OK appealing lowest common denominator, guess. Kardashians whoever get shot, fine afterwards, well, still good publicity. watching stuff too. started making trips sams club stocking soon princess cruise outbreak japan. thing stock cleaning supplies though plenty. 8 months later I'm realizing wrong. Still can't find lysol, work full time can't exactly stores stocking. Local facebook groups stay home moms post soon stock gets snatched shelves within hour. choose 98-100% efficacy good problem unless private life endangering immuno compromised people paid care for... Half people placebo. give vaccine/placebo bunch people, tell expected thing cautious social distancing that. see group gets disease. can't give everyone drug/placebo, purposefully expose virus see handle it.

So mere 185 people placebo, probably half study. Don't. Blame you. At. All. hand... That's exactly nthe study. point fastest vaccine ever developed 4 years.. Rushing vaccinate important people society great long sure corners cut ensure people issues. 

If fire, police healthcare workers issues much bigger problem. I'm 230lb male, mid 20s. never really bad side effects vaccines. Then, 3 rounds Trumemba felt like OP describing round, 2nd worst 3rd much better 1st. really person person nothing really predict otherwise. valid thoughts there, disservice argument cheapening vaccine solution 0.02% mortality rate.

I think entirety human race whole hit phase, feels like; also feels we, whole, can't mature beyond stage development we're going survive past it. Or, that's feels me, I'm anthropologist evidence back thought/idea. 


And growing one depressing things learned someone aged/got older, WAY meant 'adult' mature, smart, wise, however want put it. almost think would better prioritize. jab whoever keep jabbing till there‚Äôs one left jab According county records local TJ seven COVID cases. Yikes. like products checkout lines always discouraged me. another reason go. know!! sounds ridiculous too. didn‚Äôt even get flu shot year. It‚Äôs going brutally honest convo vaccine available. Report board nursing. don‚Äôt need hospital name that. name state practices in. vet let humans building. take pet car. know animals spread imagine less cleaning do. Peds trials ongoing proportion people coexisting conditions largely representative population. Exclusion criteria pretty lax, pretty much ""are pregnant, actively infected severe way fully OK makes feel better - sent email said could 4 hours long made nervous. Anything testing asymptomatic? true 94% focused symptoms? *Plus* existing tens millions Covid survivors antibodies. factors too. I'm simply asking sarcastic, many issues getting PPE china renegging deals nations. What? real?

That's astounding. short amount time people had, amazing work. one vaccine three viables have. Amen. insist schools open, least vaccinate teachers. say least diseases Moderna excluded trial hemophilia, immunosuppressive diseases, anything else requiring steroids immmunoglobin therapy. condition should, least theoretically, represented proportionate amount study groups. across country happening. They're definitely overestimating indoor dining open states people rushed back. Obviously pre-COVID levels, still plenty people dining days. 30-40% refuse vaccination, still 60-70% taking it. Again, R0 even fastest rising states usually barely 1. Meaning even 20% immunity enough cause cases drop rapidly. also consider herd immunity cases plays factor, even 15% state infected, 15% likely get infected/spread virus, meaning massively outsized impact transmission rates. many states likely amount infected quite bit higher 15%. 

Its exactly incredibly hard imagine even first wave vaccinations (10%~ population) cause pandemic rapidly decline. still there, endemic sense. Since it‚Äôs randomized control experiment group equally cautious since it‚Äôs blinded. anything, vaccine people might less cautious suspect real thing. friend example sore arm second injection suggesting vaccine. arm soreness, I‚Äôm careful is. cannot reach at-risk groups immediately once, smarter, ethical way help vaccinate many rapid spreaders quickly possible.

In fact, vaccine 100% effective, giving high-risk groups counter-productive convincing stop self-isolating. far better incidence general population reduced quickly possible. vast majority cases age 65 mild.

""Mild"" cases often involve sick ever life needing go hospital. Fully agreed, could 11 would gotten severe cases level exposure either didn‚Äôt get minor cases.  That‚Äôs kind say. used nicer person. Haha. I‚Äôve gotten people lately, comment much appreciated. Americans, people dying around world, many access vaccines much later. Imagine seeing Americans Europeans getting vaccinated, knowing long time chance. Ok, necessarily follow, happen case journals.  

I subscribed Science Nature several years; consistently fantastic articles scientific/medical topics communities/policies around first half issue.

They produce free podcast hear reporters talk stories want taste it. Talking vaccine. recovered June. scary. I've hardly left house 8 months, food delivered, still leave packages garage least 2-3 days opening, excessively wash hands touching anything anyone may touched, went first store weeks ago get flu shot willing continue keep family getting it. However, understand everyone else position continue doing. can't wait take vaccine normalcy life, concerns... Umm.

Brass tacks: We've seen change that's going happen. There's going UBI keep people afloat, folks who've decided hoax going come around.

It's time us individually play end, button stay away people get second dose vaccine. Get stuff delivered, make excuses family holidays, wear N95 go inside someplace home. sad think, numbers like accurate reach herd immunity vaccine even becomes universally available. 40% obese.. jesus christ. even include overweight (but obese) folks.. wrong?

Or force everyone get it? bets? Like cup already full, can't successfully add liquid; US seems heading direction, virus can't spread *when already everywhere.* jesus christ, saving many lives possible. fuck morality, saving lives.  think spatially. That's hard dividing lines arithmetic/geometry (which visualize easily) algebra/trig/etc. (which can't). problem numbers larger normally manipulate (which 877 Billion tests scarier people 1.4 trillion talking government spending).  would probably CFR based trials known data without inference total infected. Im working based reported results. current global population 76000000 people, assuming 100 percent infection rate I'm guessing would take years. worries discovered virus within past year, still learning new things it, already vaccine claims 90%+ efficacy.

70%+ great, I'm little skeptical. oop evidence brother dad say ""it works""? try get infected vaccine completely absorbed? Serious delay vaccines getting cost lives, FDA sits twiddles thumbs waits that‚Äôs always do, hell pay. someone wants dispute Fauci saying, burden show basis so.

You burden proof backwards: someone wants claim children get sick spread contagious viral infection must prove claim, runs counter historical fact, accurate one.

Without evidence, simply claiming Fauci expert constitutes logical fallacy (appeal authority). appeals authority supposed trump appeals authoritative sources, Fauci pediatrician specialize pediatric virology. Posting didn‚Äôt get answer husband get tested today colleague corona. tests negative go get tested still. quarantined since got call yesterday. Short answer: certain political party spent last 30 years demonizing facts, rational thought, science, critical thinking, anything causes followers question they're hearing. really though? True anti-vaxxers fairly small minority. realize ton people say trust vaccine, think important distinguish concerns speed put use brand new mRNA technology vs. actual anti-vaxxers. first group going shrink vaccine gets deployed high-priority people issues fail appear.

When said ""pull staff"" meant states. Right there's many outbreaks geographically back specialists call. 

This disaster scenario people talked beginning. March bad we're big country, could put hands deck NY. Bullshit headline. this:

""Convalescent plasma help patients hospitalized severe covid-19 received weeks might done good."" rough side effects, apparently. Bad headaches, flu like symptoms, extremely sore arm, etc.

But better live shitty week vaccine side effects live bad case covid. 

I suspect social media going predictably disappointing hyperbole side effects though. expect lot bullshit shares going viral tune ""the vaccine almost killed me!"" such. Yes, realized, 5.4%, error.
 70+ significant risk (although idea flu IFR 70+, cannot compare). much antibody life short. think still don‚Äôt know accurate timeline long antibodies remain, we?

That‚Äôs bright idea, long don‚Äôt prevent rest us getting back life. post unrelated article. talking nurse Salem, they're talking somebody else LA. side effects? add this, vaccine directly immune system reacting to. mRNA vaccine tells cells create protein, attacked immune system. recently Covid, you‚Äôd probably already circulating antibodies (or immune memory make them) fit spike protein.

And much larger sample people received intended dose?1  go FDA, pass flying colors. Right now, it‚Äôs relevant. Investigate want come July, talk increases vaccine skepticism Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* source? studies saw point contrary. think, optimistically, race back normality time hit summer. herd immunity choking virus completely, enough vaccines distribution completely change points spread killing us (for example requiring vaccines planes, hospitals, food production jobs). vaccine requiring zero cooling? They're probably concerned they'll get worse value others get sooon. Yeah. Wisconsin around 70,000 active cases (hospitalized, non-deceased, within 30 days initial diagnosis). Likely also skews true case number upward bit.  Well many even believe science point, maybe church open prayer ward them. get treatment believe hospital beds get freed people same. 

Knowing they're wrong excuse respecting beliefs. want let church heal let them. Telling they're wrong makes double anyway. Yes please, quarantine destroyed life, can't wait get fucked local bars It‚Äôs not. passes FDA, money behind bearing whether works, talk increases vaccine skepticism sounds suspiciously much like actual science. Can't wait perhaps get two years available general population free low Cancel everything, wait real holiday, Jan 20th It‚Äôll never eradicated unfortunately.

But even vaccine nothing spread 100% effective severe cases, that‚Äôs home run. cares covid goes around like common cold that‚Äôs age 30 make 35% cases 7% hospitalizations.

Under 30 make 35% cases 0.4% deaths (14 3,307, 20-29 cohort). way inject sunlight inside body? /s town (one worst ones California), 100% mask usage stores, like 70% mask usage outside.

The main driver people going parties stupidly, it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre wearing masks.

Of course that‚Äôs anecdotal, point least 70% people want this, know vaccine way it. Yes, understand coming need information study. However look worldwide serious infection rate 15%, 0.16%. cannot calculate rate infection, many variables, must work data controls introduce. such, way hell say vaccine 100% effective blocking serious cases. sample space small already multiple mutations particular virus (already one would make current vaccine ineffective, afaik one controlled culling mink population), I‚Äôm allergic eggs. may seem like big deal, 90% vaccines needed grown egg shells would put anaphylactic shock (I learned hard way).

But someone tell general population trust vaccine hasn‚Äôt gone years trials?

I COVID fortunately minimally affected. I‚Äôm anti-vaxxer, find vaccine like troubling one knows long term implications. understand elderly immunocompromised would take this, don‚Äôt trust young adult many years ahead. Thanks, misinterpreted entirely well.

That's fantastic news. don‚Äôt know full story obviously lot trouble admitting patients ED one week beds full. calling satellite hospitals couldn‚Äôt either. eventually people get discharged hospital that‚Äôs status fluctuate. Covid also kinda comes waves. guess lot people put visiting doctor wasn‚Äôt covid causing people admitted.

People get transferred hospitals really need admission. governments could take distribute free citizens. Get profit motive completely. Trump lost election, System released new music, COVID vaccine. 2020 really may end high note. good point. thank this! Trickle economics class warfare waged oligarchs 99% destroyed it.

""Modern life""? LMFAO. FYI... Regardless good Moderna vaccine may be... They've never commercial FDA-approved product market before... Ever.

This means factories manufacturing chain never FDA inspected... Ever.

They get first inspection later approval process. 

Pfizer least track record safety efficacy manufacturing processes, factories FDA inspected processes, passed.

Moderna can't say this. 

Just something think choice vaccines. Could even though since Uncle perfectly healthy got vaccine currently hospital course not. think nurses people set better example this. *shrugs* maybe shot itself, don‚Äôt know. lasts couple days real issue. take couple days hitting gym fine.

Stop spreading misinformation. speed manufacture mRNA vaccines though, potential combo vaccine mRNA common serotypes. dunno, thought. whole new way manufacturing data currently lagging. what‚Äôs actually available shows number cases skyrocketed recently.

Humanity put another deadly disease grill. July surge also quite sunbelt states enacted mask mandates even though compliance significantly lower want, almost certainly blunted second surge. There‚Äôs club noticed open near even though county curfew rn. Didn‚Äôt see people wearing masks either. Also saw bunch people barbershop wearing masks night. :/ likeeeee may get furloughed second time year people NEED go parties wear mask actually keep things open. -_- assume I‚Äôm affected every time go work Walmart also? I'm saying buy that's people feel. i'm gonna camping front cvs like gamestop Moderna way fluffed number bit. customary report vaccines effectiveness 10% increments. Pfizer initial results showed 93.3% effectiveness (83/90 got Covid trial) reported 90% effectiveness. Moderna broke tradition came 94% effectiveness. Pfizer came back said got data, 163 170 people got Covid trail took placebo that's 95.8% effectiveness.  Oh, Trump wanted ban flights China, ""racist"". virus nothing political scheme get people anti-social discourage gatherings globalists agree with, meanwhile Democrat elite still whatever hell want. I've never seen much fear mongering media what's going right now.

I never surrender Constitutional rights listen Government. free will, us Americans plan keeping it. It'll subtitled ""Contracted"" Functionally, yes. Emotionally, no. since humans emotionally driven creatures, likely changed habits may led death. Unfortunately, organ transplant recipients, aids patients, immunocompromised folks get benefit vaccine. 

How so?

It's like adaptive immunity people totally gone unless we're talking extreme cases. definitely compromised mRNA subunit modalities still generate immune response.

Is something immunology I'm understanding? too, shocked found almost 80. thought late 60s. remembered position since negative 3 years old makes sense.

it really stands even compare politicians like president, president elect, speaker, majority leader, etc see much of. younger (except pelosi 3 months) look much older. much worse indoors arena ceilings hundreds feet high versus outdoors? Billions Everyone acting like guy hero, feel bad family, study actually put risk rest us aren‚Äôt studies? Breaking protocol how? 

By giving vaccine everyone, including control group. Note fact cases clinical studies done, initial data shows treatment overwhelmingly effective unconscionable withhold treatment control group, less neccessary control group given definitive results are. case vaccine here. knowing died death help billions worth something Replace word ""after"" ""before"" time travel back knew one week ago  Wait, guy died due COVID chance vaccine pretty effective got placebo end luck? placebo didn‚Äôt anything right sorry I‚Äôm asking dumb questions Living ""parks rec"" full fantasy. vulnerable who, beyond personal risk, also clog hospital beds consume medical resources.

If issue likely consume resources, vaccinate obese Republicans first, since least likely wear mask. funny, I'm joking. That's logic.

I think better avoid kinds fights simply distribute precious vaccine quickly efficiently possible. Anywhere plop -100F deep-freeze vaccinate many people quickly, that. *so* many ways Pfizer vaccine gain temperature potentially lose efficacy, prioritize distribution. Draft retired people fight covid? terrible idea. Ideas like still covid first placeüëç long kind protective immunity last? Still unknown despite lay people reddit discovered memory B cells think way compare number severe cases total control group severe cases total vaccinated group.

That's I'm doing. I'm adjusting number COVID cases. Zero severe cases vaccinated group meaningful expected 1 2 severe cases. Inb4 ""why people make healthy choices like eating right smoking behind fat asses smokers""

Because make public health decisions based overall outcomes, giving obese chain smokers vaccine projected result lower overall deaths / negative outcomes compared giving healthy people, make decision leads best overall outcome. sucks individuals, make decisions individuals. make decisions populations. really think careers required good grades, college significant debt would also amenable working home?

If anything, hopefully pandemic puts new spotlight public health things done long ago like making acceptable doctors encourage patients lose weight make healthy lifestyle changes (doctors largely afraid saying anything constructive obese patients), subsidizing gym memberships, delivering healthy foods food deserts, etc. We'll also deal increase obesity result sedentary lifestyle prompted pandemic.

I would also point total 1.469 million deaths total 45.247 million outcomes total death rate 3.25%. Therapies improved year, actual infection rate higher would certainly bring down, still hard time reconciling 0.16% serious infection rate 3.25% death rate. definition, serious infection rate higher death rate, likely significantly so.

With said, though, found piece information makes make bit sense. According [original Moderna press cited many articles (though one linked OP), COVID cases cited *symptomatic* cases. Since COVID cases asymptomatic, actual infection rate trial likely much higher 196 cited. governmental agencies havn't funded one yet beyond me.

I agree.

I believe large studies done now, might show causation (if any). I'm it.

BACKGROUND

Convalescent plasma frequently administered patients Covid-19 reported, largely basis observational data, improve clinical outcomes. Minimal data available adequately powered randomized, controlled trials.

METHODS

We randomly assigned hospitalized adult patients severe Covid-19 pneumonia 2:1 ratio receive convalescent plasma placebo. primary outcome patient‚Äôs clinical status 30 days intervention, measured six-point ordinal scale ranging total recovery death.

RESULTS

A total 228 patients assigned receive convalescent plasma 105 receive placebo. median time onset symptoms enrollment trial 8 days (interquartile range, 5 10), hypoxemia frequent severity criterion enrollment. infused convalescent plasma median titer 1:3200 total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (interquartile range, 1:800 1:3200]. patients lost follow-up. day 30 day, significant difference noted convalescent plasma group placebo group distribution clinical outcomes according ordinal scale (odds ratio, 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 1.35; P=0.46). Overall mortality 10.96% convalescent plasma group 11.43% placebo group, risk difference ‚àí0.46 percentage points (95% CI, ‚àí7.8 6.8). Total SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers tended higher convalescent plasma group day 2 intervention. Adverse events serious adverse events similar two groups.

CONCLUSIONS

No significant differences observed clinical status overall mortality patients treated convalescent plasma received placebo. actually don‚Äôt know yet. know antibodies wane. flu also reinfects every year, consider lifetime mortality? Flu mutations must faster, considering lifetime risk flu significantly worrisome. solution? Social distance wear masks forever? No, vaccine introduced vulnerable protection go back normal. live risk stay home like hermit. I've read believe it. GIMME GIMME GIMME retail establishments open (just occupancy limits)? shutdowns progressive cautionary California office complexes, restaurants, sports arenas &amp; indoor entertainment venues. Shopping malls open, even they're predicting huge surge ICU intakes next weeks! keep telling parents afraid long term effects see getting vaccine getting next summer, take available please. depressing USA used hands world leader infectious disease control.  bordering world country. Oh sure, I‚Äôm certain would advantage take public money decided good enough could leave advantage someone else amazing Well would even go far say wasn‚Äôt even ‚Äúsacrifice‚Äù real sense. It‚Äôs really sad, situation wasn‚Äôt impacted study way. tracked. many people ignoring cdc guidelines. blame virus. people travel one year, still travel every year this. one year lost bad. still waiting citation imaginary study claim proves HEPA filtration units help. posted article (that seemed reasonably accurate) study.  article way shape form support harmful claims. Thats Venn diagram people never stopped going self centered assholes circle. absolutely idea common people maggot infested wounds require toe amputations niece started working rural health center. health problems get vaccine npc. ever forget that. seems like poor control Don‚Äôt step dreams either got vaccine placebo. chances exactly 50/50. Please try tangentially divert conversation feelings customer service pandemic. non sequitur. wonder likely eta shortened even halfed many refuse vaccine rest don‚Äôt issue it. Anti vaxxer April Fool's day... anyone educate side effects this. Including long term possibilities  think they‚Äôre going inject arms - you, friend. last time saw guy Wednesday. got call yesterday. think arguing good faith I'll say this. Women always made feel like need change something. Always. Usually, surrounding weight. 8 years old went first diet 16 throwing food. fat never been, I'm short big hips never look like model. one told me, ever, okay dieted dieted.

I've fitness industry almost decade meet thousands women year shapes sizes. know thin women base entire worth weight cannot allow day off. know heavy women even feel like deserve space studio size.

Also, redditors say weight loss easy thing, taking account many physiological psychological factors play differently men (hormones, particularly testosterone play huge part ability lose weight estrogen makes us hold onto it). easy many everyone would it.

When women says ""f it"" dieting rejecting years told good enough unless actively dieting. giving break body positivity movement gives women permission that. (If around younger probably would much healthier attitude food eating self worth). saying ""time start eating shit stop exercising"". happen. reasons people things body positivity one the..

I know I'm gonna get downvoted ""what men""d comment I'm tired people thinking body positivity awful thing. gives women agency bodies way we've never before. person says woman thinking, looks lot like trying take agency away. containment measures flair now? Lockdown never good news. great year! Broke shut downs, scared working high Covid risk environment, ability see friends fun deal stress. broke alone. Well goal reduce disease, infections. doesn‚Äôt matter someone gets infected never develops symptoms immune system squishes quickly don‚Äôt get hidden, long-haul symptoms either. could asymptomatic Covid, less symptoms are, less chance viral spreading quicker recovery true negative state. Even true sterilising immunity (which could be), low level symptoms bound reduce actual retransmission least. preview come.

The anti maskers people hanging large crowds blame. magically HSV2, think would sure lot help stigma it. get forward payment mean put 110% vaccine efforts like every company did. plan widely available. No, whoever damn well please private property is. issue, click says ""fixed link"" next original link posted above. Suburban areas kind crazy like too. Everything close together completely inaccessible multi-lane roads lack sidewalks crosswalks.

I travel lot work can't even count number times restaurant literally across street hotel safe way getting there. Hope $12 turkey worth it. love arse Ok, cool. Another question popped up. go get first half vaccine two weeks later get booster fuck they're out. again, hopefully they're dose hanging second dose storage person come back. interesting logistics figure out. Here's you. seems decent argument lie. I'm sure mom proud no, tinsel. tinsel distracting. died 5 different ways mess. didn't, much alive good spirits. mean, there's pretty clear difference two categories listed ... 

To make big generalization: sitting activities dangerous standing activities dangerous walking activities. Crap. People seem willing get point. Thats studies like randomised controlled trials. matters p value assertion might care make small sample size many unknowns built trial design, don‚Äôt think anyone could reasonably speculate current interim results come anywhere near statistical significance without common fuckery like one-sided test fitting. multiple studies showing smokers significantly higher risk? remember reading several shown smokers less likely catch covid, also smokers underrepresented severe covid cases. still think know sure why, one reasons nicotine patches used medical professionals beginning pandemic. community good come ahead individual rights, least United States. countries obviously incorrect. Check works Distributed Bio, verge making generalized coronavirus-vaccine. don‚Äôt give shit I‚Äôll take people‚Äôs lives abstract principle slave owners designed hundreds years ago.

What NY recruiting additional doctors? referencing rights whatnot? recruitment campaign.

Or intentionally trying aggravate topic referencing something emotional? They're upset they're afraid go back lockdown. US never truly locked people really care Healthcare workers top list. 1) worth risk side effects illnesses cause minor inconvenience immunity tends short lived

2) already said hundreds viruses requiring hundreds vaccines. Packing hundreds vaccines one shot creates useless scattered immune response ""Their going job anyway to. What's alternative? Quit give up?""

Actually yes, alternative Educators across country leaving field record numbers since spring, even states literally fine thousands dollars breaking contracts. effects Covid-19 job, people like attitude toward existed since Pandemic , worsened it. make sure count days last exposure co-worker take least 5 days contact virus build detectable levels. get tested couple days would register false negative, especially rapid antigen tests! hard tell difference. think people never stopped going probably pretty rude people haven‚Äôt due covid. may biased opinion though. trying understand.

Based 11 infections 0 severe cases. enough data prove prevent severe cases?

I mean 185 placebo group, 30 severe 1 death. That's 149 (or 80%) non-severe cases. mean it‚Äôs flu level dangerousness can‚Äôt move lives? Like hospitals clear deaths accept risk? feel like half people know Class II III. say me? give little general info Katie Couric CEO Moderna. doses delivered feds they'll distributed states based population. They'll administered free state Health Dept., go CVS get them. 

I know answer questions hope sheds little light. podcasts, highly recommend one, ton info vaccine, works get first. genital herpes (HSV2) read possible vaccination herpes MRNA technology. think vaccine great step finally combat disease many failed attempts. excellent news! follow prominent cancer meme/community Instagram account chick got absolutely lambasted followers. One follower even part oncology nurse team apparently well liked among coworkers. RI several ready go last spring didn‚Äôt need them. Now, we‚Äôre using üò£ put elderly people risk? No!

Fuck this! time make masks social distancing law ban gatherings necessary. laws backed fines long jail sentences.

An idiot's rights end behavior puts someone else danger.

Lord 51 days madness left. can't pass quickly enough. Yeah, no. cherry-picked articles discussing whether established science could possibly wrong. make science incorrect. simply anti-science take face value. 81 chance getting symptomatic COVID.

That's good point. know 29804 (minus 196) asymptomatic? COVID test 30,000? 29804 tested asymptomatic valid conclusions? 1. start virus 

2. create chaos havoc around virus high survival rate (unless you‚Äôre 80+)

3. sAvE WoRlD!!! Imagine, will, administration trash reach back former administration stop gap next administration. perfect ‚Äúobese Americans‚Äù thumbnail doesn‚Äôt exi‚Äî tested COVID 3 times: prior getting vaccine month later. Also, anyone reports symptom immediately tested. RIP VADER!!! I‚Äôm supposed miserable next years? Great. thought y‚Äôall saying summer looked hopeful. Even fauci. I‚Äôm irritated I‚Äôm 20 years old work high risk anyways. Please god let go within year source states involuntary? people realize 'drafted' essentially another word requesting additional personnel. **drafted**: select (a person group people) bring somewhere certain *""he drafted help task force best safety practices""* goal vaccinations save many people possible, reward good behavior. means smokers get lumped unhealthy risk people, that's goes. able isolate work home, also suggests someone can't work home less prudent pandemic safety might get vaccine too. feel right, roll needs maximize number lives saved. That‚Äôs lives lost. FDA notorious running fast dialup. FDA gotten away one usually cares.

If rest given approvals FDA decides sit nothing per usual, can‚Äôt hide time. Everyone mother expects vaccination process begins December 15 shortly thereafter. People know.

And course, outrage gets nothing done, big business however, outrage get shit done, like rest us, kinda want vaccine process started certainly ways let‚Äôs say ‚Äúnudging‚Äù donate congress tell FDA need get shot together. mean, I‚Äôd easier time believing anyone‚Äôs anecdotes could see literally dataset trial participants far we‚Äôve gotten exactly nothing besides interim top line PR announcements worth little anyone clinical trial experience Jesus Christ. Pfizer would moved vaccine arm EUA approval unblinding study anyway, made appear pathetic. 

There several people study took antibody tests determine they‚Äôd given placebo, despite told signing agreement wouldn‚Äôt turned had. I‚Äôm sure study center found removed study. stupid move man, get wait March April get it. They‚Äôre really upset, zero sympathy. REALLY pisses several signed J&amp;J study now. remember takes least 5 days exposure virus build detectable levels, especially Rapid Antigen tests. roomie reckless refuses tested 3 4 days. move next 2 weeks, camping friend's garage somewhere would safest. can't, mask times around try apartment much possible. might stupid question, purpose placebo trial? Pandemics global definition. Even rich countries get vaccinated, pandemic continue poor countries, means there'll always risk new flareup rich countries unless continue vaccinate (like measles) Even Fauci said serious reforms considered Biden administration re-enters WHO, ""lot problems"".

They're owned China disgusting. agree lot Trump coronavirus, leavin justified IMO. Probably 3 4 honestly. 

There plenty candidates. 

And use different methods/resources parallel production them. merrier. AZ, Niners play train State Farm Stadium go back Santa Clara County

AZ would good playoff bubble, far city center hotels nearby. Think it. poor people would sign things since need money. means poor people become guinea pigs rich people. extra doctors nurses came NY‚Äôs help spring can‚Äôt time around. prepare time there‚Äôs fallback aid come help out.

Thank succinct realistic appraisal. I'm heartened see NY taking proactive measures planning likely end fairly busy winter. I'm you, man. get vaccine, going feel like getting Tony Stark's armor. Sure, I'll happily wear mask model good citizen--when able go world without terror. AZ submit data FDA approval 62% dosage? understand saying thanks replying without vitriol genuinely trying learn it. 

I agree losing weight WAY beyond ""don't eat much exercise."" purposely say ""it's easy!"" know first-hand isn't. mental hurdles beyond belief get healthier lifestyle people starting journey uphill 80 pound pack back. 

I would never disparage someone glad body in. judge others journey unless spreading fallible logic stating ""healthy."" Sure, healthier someone sick someone diabetes, claiming healthy bit stretch. Good physical health (I believe) would imply able moderate strenuous physical activities without extreme reactions. example (all non-extreme circumstances like old age, disabilities, etc), reasonable average person walk one two flights stairs moderate pace completely breath top. reasonable jog minutes stand 30 minutes without experiencing major joint pain fatigue. reasonable someone able lift modest weigh repeatedly without feeling exhaustion. I'm saying comprehensive infallible list, feel ladies seen body-positive would trouble these. 

Two things:

1. agree dieting ridiculous term shift narrative ""clean diet"" ""healthier lifestyle"" since know dieting exercising equal results unless pair together. 

2. I've seen inverse skinny and/or fit women looked upon choosing lifestyle someone else wants. thin mean healthy either, also give someone right say ""need eat more."" say that, I've seen inverse muscular women getting lambasted posting progress photo someone commenting poster ""fatphobic"" rubbing choices ""real woman"" looks like. That's equally terrible IMO. Weight scale equal health either way (skinny fat)

All all, yes, women feel valuable matter what. Yes, works reject certain thin-ness certain sized breasts considered ""beautiful."" No, pretend ""healthy"" (I chose ""healthy"" ""beautiful"" ""attractive"" totally different independent one another) making wise diet choices, refusing exercise, pretending choices going beneficial long-term. thinking antibodies short time, antibody count goes body quickly make encounter again. verdict still know extremely unlikely get pandemic already NYC. NY state.

The city hospitals still fine. Thank explanation. makes lot sense! smoking last night and, order cut smell, like teenager, I've started exhaling carboard tube stuffed dryer sheets. front dryer sheet resin exhale one breath. grosses think worse lungs, was.

I've done research seems that, smoking cannabis damage lungs physical act inhaling smoke, cancer rates follow. know exactly yet, think various theories anti-inflammatory properties, THC actually direct affect tumor formation. 


For part, Minnesota gets act together legalizes, I'll switching THC tinctures oils only. Yeah going 5 days week COVID recently got back gym. Literally place go outside house gym, get groceries delivered work home. figure get infected gym there's chance spreading elsewhere go anywhere. dont want kind lose level headedness us appreciate every dumb thing trump says, really keep waiting leaked audio interview Fauci comes unglued. blame one bit Paying trial participants entice disadvantaged people joining studies detrimental without properly considered risks. basically buying someone's health. People participate studies potential benefit themselves. Obviously exceptions. reimburse people expenses travel lost wages; there's risk harm, example simply survey behavioural study, small compensation ok order improve recruitment. paying people injected untested drug generally considered unethical. already Vornado full room air circulation fans, position appropriately layout always feel breeze common area. us means facing one wall another towards open sliding door(works best door open wide enough fan air) . door window ""each end"" open. visits parents last month, visitors now. guys seem completely allergic kind nuance non black white thinking shows. Yeesh. Aisle isle.  feel like idea ""as soon as"" keeping idea ""as soon as."" Let's also consider accomplishment first mRNA vaccine ever! hitting ball park quickly rather astonishing.

I believe everything peer reviewed yet we'll need see feedback that. wonder going make impact percentage ""long haul"" experiencers. hear even mild COVID cause long term complications. Oh, wow. That's really sad. Thanks explanation though. Ooohhh makes sense you‚Äôre one crazy people wearing tinfoil hat. Gotcha! Oh ya sure going beer important children getting education contributing society. wonder afford beer though one hires don‚Äôt even high school diploma.. It‚Äôs extremely discouraging. Feel like I‚Äôve distance many people care about. don‚Äôt seem care! actually think live Texas lol. Since I'm relatively healthy, skipped mine, doctor talked going lab get blood work done. pon far? Seriously doubt US, however grocery stores considered essential. Actually.... opposite happened me. home, unemployed, quarantining since March boyfriend. spent every single day together. get wrong, COVID fatigue strong struggle. together almost 2.5 years. COVID made us realize thankful little have. We'll getting married December courthouse. family, party, us. aware overweight causes asthma. knew asthma could result packing extra weight due difficulties exercising. teen hated strenuous exercise routines due inevitable gasping asthma attacks. diagnosed asthma 20s due father incompetent family doctor brushing repeatedly ""just allergies"". Mmm put turkey baster shove Freedoms? 

There soo many times think people take seriously impacts personally.. see come contact someone positive, get nervous, wear mask day, go back business usual. 

Some people lose family members still dont consider serious. kind like think, well must underlying condition. go business. 

I feel like ton people US need hit square face something believe there. 

Most people work dont take seriously lot conspiracy theories. people treat others like shit generally pretty selfish treat others like doormats. Sometimes get stern people change tone something let know crossed line dont listen. swear words come dont listen. raise voice dont listen. give data whole time dont listen. tell though might hear half it. course get trouble people listen least halfway months that. 

The level stubborn Americans really something else. I'm really thinking writing article debunking whole NZ debate annoying

New Zealand locked quick, there's denying UK can't go New Zealand approachanymore. Firstly would detrimental economy would great effects virus itself.

The UK major transport links whole europe,it eurotunnel literally allows get train UK Europe. New Zealand's nearest neighbour is... Australia?

Population wise UK almost 14x population, fuck New Zealand sheep people. New Zealand split north south island need ferry cross. seperates people 2 biggest cities Auckland ChristChurch. drive London Manchester like 4 hours London Birmingham 2 like UK's populated / popular cities.

I mean London people New Zealand, London population density 4X Auckland. Birmingham 3X, Even city quite small bigger population densisty 5100. Start UK NewZealand 100 cases see fast could squash NZ, would easy, cut ferries two islands done.

UK Island != NZ Island Lockdown lockdown though. Make people follow rules. 

They Melbourne sydney also worked much larger populations. Dude super old runs shitton. No, get wasted time off.

That's ridiculous I've read, Moderna vaccine hell lot shelf-stable reasonable temperatures last longer creation disbursement Pfizer one. may, danger that, well many claims people made key timing notes:

They sax ""x"" lasts ""up to"" ""y months"" 

Because studied ""x"" months. cannot claim know happens month y+1. qualifications asked probably ignore me. 

This guess:

If resources combined controlled one entity less variables better general. 

In case lots different vaccines made prior vaccine approval multiple approvals mean multiple stock piles get utilized. Additionally big companies manufacturing. J&amp;J vaccine gets approved would huge J&amp;J much manufacturing power. 

While vaccines big win people wealthy countries wealthy cities strong medical infrastructure nowhere near meaningful poorer places, logistical issues keeping vaccines cold.

This exciting, version 2 less cold storage requirements single dose important. point game probably need keep experimenting plan vaccinate world wealthy countries. File away like company's taxes.

Yeah, fuck. never actually read articles linked looked headlines. Got it. could try pissing sparkplug. wish people reported cause death loved ones covid publicly. doctor appointment cancelled doctor covid, according admin called me. week two passed suddenly, sadly, there‚Äôs memorial post practice‚Äôs FB page, mention covid anywhere public. Just, ‚ÄúIt heavy hearts mourn loss beloved Dr. X... Donations honor may made charity.‚Äù Sweet  idea talking about. Constitution put restrict Government become powerful. Democrats hate Constitution, want infringe rights. ""hanging buddies"". also able make goddamn living keep rights, gone never get back without fight. think Democrats hellbent saying United States America ""Democracy""? hate Constitution want Americans rights gives us, want Government limited.

So, people live lick boot whatever shithole country live rights liberties, try infringe rights screeching we'll ""kill Grandma"" 5 people house, go BLM riot throw statues rivers loot businesses masses. headline kinda meaningless without per capita counts. digging, Pfizer's site: case split vaccinated individuals received placebo indicates vaccine efficacy rate 90%, 7 days second dose. means protection achieved 28 days initiation vaccination, consists 2-dose schedule.

That's going long month right there. predict ton people going fuck up. understand sympathetic people trapped food deserts, comes point aware extent healthy.
 
Information regarding nutrition readily accessible days, claiming people simply ignorant cut it.

That‚Äôs starting well local musicians though. Great. Almost high survival rate without it. Well considering I‚Äôm using one right I‚Äôd say ya I‚Äôve figure few. Comparing using app vs learning math, science, pretty much subject ridiculous. linked graph seems 80% total hospitalizations people 50 older. That‚Äôs 1/3rd American population 110 million people. Isn‚Äôt fair say majority people vaccinated lift restrictions? everything pandemic political. agree always wiggle room. much. first 6 countries listed reported fewer deaths last Monday. Like bulldozing Detroit. wonder actually gave COVID test vaccine! idea things work seems like rational thing test (if horribly wrong).

If everyone given placebo/vaccine go live lives whose say vaccine people go home leave whole time whereas placebo people went mixed community. 

Seems like hard set fair trial vaccine (hence thought might actually give virus!). Giving COVID placebo people also completely pointless though... answering questions type ‚ò∫Ô∏è ? I'm not, that's I'm calling Biden vaccine. He's going onn charge done tested starts getting rolled out. really political. you? go market.

can buy new surge like buying crystal pepsi ebay? I'm glad see somebody mention this, certain point hit exponential decay worst spreaders removed pool spreaders first Yes. should. Yeah America country affected this...   good arguments. apply asymptomatic cases without vaccination well, way. Obviously vaccine greatly improves chances either get infected, asymptomatic, milder symptoms. Yes is. ""Compared patients longer incubation period days), shorter incubation period (‚â§7 days) significantly likely severe disease diagnosis (p &lt; 0.01), longer duration hospitalization (p &lt; 0.01), longer time symptom onset discharge (p &lt; relationship found SARS1. "" findings suggest patients shorter incubation period proceeded severe disease. studies needed investigate potential biological mechanisms association. "") 3 weeks 2nd dose read, however widely available data given take vaccine. MO whole pandemic under-promising. Sure, could April, also could bit earlier. sounds nice see either possible inauguration, requires political cooperation right now.  There's 39 countries 200000 cases total 180 countries less. countries reported less cases total US single day. I'm sure person replied means, participants always compensated. (personally think participate chance win studies BS)

However, guidelines around *how much* pay want coerce poor people study otherwise it, there's risk all. 

For example, offered $10,000 COVID challenge trial (where infect purpose see vaccine works), many poorer people would agree, without due consideration risks payment high. compensation $500, people would spend time weighting personal pros cons (note, work area, I'm making numbers). Np. Also context discriminate means pick exclude, discriminate sense work school.  God damn Patriot never forget save us all. world thanks you. Medical dental schools don‚Äôt teach much way statistics. hardly agree you, work pharmacovigilance hype technology never used... scary... even studied reason though, trying figure highest risk noticed trend smokers getting several different countries. IIRC, China, Italy, France reported similar findings AFAIK smokers much higher death rate US either. God forbid people look forward things haven‚Äôt done awhile.  Course probably also guy die got vaccine. Hmm interesting. good news b-cells seem 6 months earlier post infection. Notably b cells remember make antibodies. according Crottys study. Two episodes ago Week Virology. gathered nobody really knows time, vaccine natural immunity. Honestly misread title read like 3 times. really good news I'm little confused Belgium shipping many vaccines USA, Belgium dire straights w/ COVID sure feel this. 

Yes, obsesity makes susceptible severe COVID, time, put alcoholics top liver transplant lists. That's participant count high. wait X number placebo group infected compare infection rate vaccine group. sample size high enough, tends filter likelihood vaccine group happened avoid virus. Sorry meant pre-reception part. saw relative‚Äôs posted pictures, dancing music outside. food also served outside.  surprised would large number people there. state wasn‚Äôt really woods (and numbers scary now). Except really. mild cases like cold flu. doubt.  fun breaks US Navy size year. chronic symptoms post-covid? I‚Äôd love hear addressed. 

I‚Äôm hearing mild cases leave even really healthy people lasting effects... Thank you. helpful. sister start working one CNA like...a month ago?....she got positive test couple days ago... wonder threatened stick, given $$$, both. Yeah, right. Go get em tiger Businesses livelihoods may destroyed mental health millions affected, countless lives saved. son months ago. Glad still allowed there. idea getting still bit terrifying. 

My wife stays home. get brought home anti science coworkers try avoid much possible. given option work home. attitude exactly it‚Äôs end. Vaccines end beginning, beginning end despite unwashed masses want believe. That‚Äôs thing science, discards belief. individuals asked choose multiple vaccines? don‚Äôt flu vaccine. Since identical, differences one probably ‚Äúbetter‚Äù. haven‚Äôt seen articles work. Anyone links details? Regardless good Moderna vaccine may be... They've never commercial FDA-approved product market before... Ever.

Same true Pfizer least track record safety efficacy manufacturing processes, factories FDA inspected processes, Moderna can't say this.

For average every day people Yes! Let finally see grandma without worry killing her! Alchohol prohibition 2.0. unfortunate truth illegalize something creates black market it. guessing vaccine that's rushed market long term data might side effects virus primarily harmful old obese diabetics. entering harsher tiered system current lockdown, hopefully spike again.

The economy public health happening bubbles, rely other. wanted pop say state borders *can* closed, 'pestilence' unlimited travel would directly materially interfere safety welfare state US whole much risk taking predict, much much study authors allowed account for. trivially easy figure got real shot instead placebo because: A, soreness severe B, get rapid test antibodies free US (which would mean got real shot).

Anecdotally, many reports folks knew received real shot going taking major risks time. means real efficacy probably much higher reported. Nah, take week call sick next day! isn‚Äôt staff available expand capacity many areas now. spring droves medical staff came NY. many cases throughout whole country aren‚Äôt people move around. Hospitals surge plans place either double patients rooms, take units hospital, staff largest issue. UK busiest city Europe know. London probably annual visitors NZ Australia combined keep going back missing point. 

Virtual learning working. 

Now, say health risks significant start school back up. mean virtual learning working. 

Virtual learning working. isn't. Parents know this. 

This year pretty much write-off lot kids. need face that, pretend. Ok. Norway believe speeding tickets. way worth hundred million dollars getting speeding ticket actually deterrent laughable pocket change resolution. read article? doctor quoted specifically said don‚Äôt leave neighborhood 5 weeks. 

How sensational suggesting people can‚Äôt stay neighborhoods 5 weeks things like know make money support family put food table among things. Nowhere article suggest exceptions rules proposing. Perhaps it‚Äôs understood, don‚Äôt know maybe journalist included little bit info. see heavy breather, sure obesity, COVID  data data is. see anyone fields risking career freedom (fraud would mean jail) 'one-up' another manufacturer, especially vaccines clearly sufficient efficacy approved. 

I agree fact novel drug delivery method something guard - vaccine theoretically safe (there obvious biological reason assume would create long term harm) practically safe (the studies indicated worrying short long term effects date despite nearly hundred thousand people taking mRNA vaccines). Happy cake day Capitalism makes priority list empathy economy lot universally ambiguous Excellent piece. 11 vaccine group got 100% 11 huge sample. possible, likely American's good following laws. Thanks this. best explanation seen far.  lungs *want* absorb oxygen, they‚Äôre totally sure it‚Äôs right decision long-term. independent clinical trials outside Russia, drug efficiency scientifically proven. worst case effective could be? main concern injected something hasnt researched long term could potentially give health issues ie cancer seems logical non human origin viral vector would likely provoke kinds rare side effects one human population generations. Homeless people would imagine many parties outside case. things anyone find cases. people Japan student Visa? diplomats Hungary? man know name from? Trump administration (and others) saying two vaccines available coming weeks, likely case phase 1. 

Others saying predict vaccine available ***everyone*** April 2021. another user said, that's challenge trial comes strong ethical risks along actually know much virus would needed someone get infected. virus place US normally, there's really need right now. Venezuela 2.0 94% effective virus 99.92% survival rate age 65? Hmmm interesting disagree I'd rather use conservative estimates. 

And even worst hit regions like Bergamo likely half population got infected still small outbreaks people wear masks. That's likely second half 2021 be. People still cautious threat virus go away, it'll smaller issue.  find hard believe many vaccines efficacy. would interested probability 3 novel vaccines 94%+ efficacy within weeks other. always get second opinion dealing medical procedures diagnoses, however, important really make sure now.

If lucky enough find family doctor personally think equally important develop long-term relationship them. Sure, really question validity telling there's nothing wrong seeking additional opinions. Likely suggest same, especially dramatic diagnoses. 

'Shopping around' every time give diagnosis find doctor tells want hear seem efficient good health. Certainly, doctors benefit background consultations previous visits draw from. really like doctor try find new one feel trust.

I think anyone goes much effort screw patients. There's lot easier paths making money involve decade extra schooling. Really appreciate Trumps leadership getting us vaccine fast! That's two cents I'd say comes mainly defiance institutions, government, deep inner conviction nothing come good intentions.

Also local celebrities unfortunately bought autism / sclerosis conspiracy theories helped spreading national medias.

For decades, succeeding governments unofficial policy anti vaxxers basically live let live, that's kind luxury afford country ravaged dangerous epidemic. believe widespread all.

Hospitals employ nurses who's entire job recode doctors diagnosis - make money hospital.

Ceremony reception indoors, rest outdoors. Frankly, didn‚Äôt seem safe. high risk people tried make accommodations felt putting people hard place ‚Äúdo go risk health‚Äù ‚Äúdo miss important milestone‚Äù? likely moron dragged everything force, matter ridiculous... 1st world problems There's time place everything. it. really hard kind respectful others, especially sub global pandemic we're struggling through. Two things consider:

1. Infectious disease vaccines reach Phase 3 actually success, typically takes years get efficacy data. Covid vaccine trials succeeded quickly disease spreading fast. Normally, takes years infectious disease vaccines prove effectiveness, volunteers get infected fixed rate. Covid spreading rapidly evidence effectiveness generated much faster pace.
2. used vaccine development taking decades that's saw lifetimes. early vaccines easy 1800's physicians really know viruses could develop rudimentary vaccine within months work. Vaccine research existing diseases slow easy problems got solved centuries ago, stuck hardest nuts crack. Covid brand-new virus, could easy rabies hard HIV, think got lucky. like SARS1, might still stuck animal research phase. Yes, Vitamin K2: ""Natt≈ç extremely rich source MK7 variant vitamin K2, one study finding mean concentrations 998Œºg MK7 per 100g natto, 500 times greater concentration food tested."" (Wikipedia) ...All 11 vaccine group classified mild... America seems. Dr Birx: black friday shoppers went crowded doorbusters pandemic, fine kid goes school LAUSD. Still distance learning only. Bars restaurants closed on-site dining drinking. Take-out restaurants. don‚Äôt wear mask supermarket *will* asked leave. 

I don‚Äôt know anyone who‚Äôs COVID-19 yet. Knock wood. Call us nanny state hear things going parts country, remember we‚Äôre way reason. Vulnerable people advised shelter home day 1. Again, seem get it. 

A vaccine's purpose ""protect vulnerable first"", purpose stop spread disease. 

Giving essential workers superspreaders efficient method significantly reduce spread. Easy say life risk. I‚Äôll honest, vaccine huge failure fucks people worst they‚Äôll probably fined like BP ecological fuck up, roughly pennies dimes compared make they‚Äôll probably make money fined end don‚Äôt care want first market

Capitalism really fuck lot shit get coming from. think consider n=196 actually decent patient sample population. purpose 30,000 volunteers increase chances able record infections. yes ideally want see placebos get infected vaccinated group protected, still convincing show 196 patients infected, 30 severe cases 30 placebo group. kind using obscure calculations make something look statistically insignificant. parent ‚Äúwants‚Äù way health risks teachers faculty staff ""One person wrote: ""Ashley Grames¬†should nursing license revoked bragging wearing mask practicing social distancing oncology nurse ‚Äî¬†exposing immunocompromised people absolutely disgusting embarrassing behavior medical professional.""


Agreed. incredibly stupid incredibly selfish, probably both. Either way, longer trusted work medicine. ""Moderna evaluated 196 confirmed Covid infections among late-stage trial‚Äôs 30,000 participants. company said 185 cases Covid observed placebo group versus 11 cases observed group received vaccine. resulted estimated vaccine efficacy 94.1%, company said."" Reference: 1st debate First we'll get grande finale though. think amount restrictions, higher taxes, better weather people fleeing NE Florida. Des Moines, IA limiting number customers time. They've months here...  That‚Äôs total bullshit literally millions Americans disregarding pandemic daily. idea dumb nurses bad millions folks traveling thanksgiving folks hitting bars every weekend disgusting.

We‚Äôre ones taking care patients take final breath audacity group majority us dunces tictoc. I‚Äôd love see gown work twelve COVID unit say bullshit. I‚Äôve got friends took every precaution congenital heart issues got COVID taking care critically ill patients, yet it‚Äôs fault disease spreading Jim Jane TGI Friday‚Äôs fifth time month. think means third country may sick, necessarily immune. Oh god! don‚Äôt know! hilarious xD think everything else, could let sit room temperature couple days call good. Someone referred months ago ‚Äúself-sterilizing.‚Äù Belgium, Spain, Italy, UK coronavirus deaths per capita U.S. does. also third world countries? I'm wondering get multiple tests per month work? often get tested make sure get diagnosed COVID even asymptomatic? pretty rapid, choreographed, 4 5 waves 8. also employee double check running around counting people clicker. Dry ice always readily available.

Yes is. Cold storage supply chain thing definitively ""worked out"" much rich world. really wish would delete posts, much misinformed personal musings, largely factually wrong. used think ""too smart objective"" fall placebo nocebo effect tell you, opioid withdrawal know point wearing MUCH WORSE somehow distracted watch clock bit. know injecting fact contain amount opioid actually feel relief first brain realizes 99% opioid receptors unoccupied. people sides brainwashed. Cuomo first good early stages pandemic, despite much urgency. get it. Now, becoming politician exactly arguing months back. also side isle NY, lawsuit lawsuit open things back up. Cuomo said okay slowly went up.
We 0.5% positivity rate month. State wide, 0.7% month. Schools opened back up. Restaurants opened back up. guy keeps saying ""we working hard"", yet dont anything.
It's simple. Shut 2 weeks open back again. Shut schools 2 weeks well. winter. 40F weather. Parents working home. NYS, landlords cannot evict anyone renters well residential commercial mortgage come halt.
So, shut 2 weeks?
Because idiot wants business healthcare.
Right now, called retired doctors nurses hospitals almost capacity now. stupid call retired healthcare staff mismanagement It‚Äôs unrealistic think moderators keep track every comment sub. see something breaks rules, report made aware. still pissed whole ""taskforce"" done. Instead pandering orange one co, gone rogue. Created fucking task force let Trump scream little void Twitter.

This demonstrates incredible lack understanding comes government works... let guess, think president gets make laws too? Ooof dated nurse definitely crystals essential oils crowd. Hope least taking corona seriously feeling ominous dread read number cases recently gone &amp; know hospitalization &amp; death rates follow 2 weeks time, even though current death rate dropped. wait onslaught dreaded data next month. Could help us learn something unfortunate experience describe encounter weed guy bit more? Outdoors whole time? Distance apart? long standing distance? much talking time? masked, anyone?

Also: wash hands baggie whatever afterwards? long potentially could handled weed smoke it? Inhaling smoke vapor virus-contaminated weed seems like interesting question itself; perfect transmission route lungs, wouldn‚Äôt heat destroy virus instantly? Okay. conversation going where. nice day! someone explain vaccine actually does? realize boosts immunity virus actually us pragmatically? 


Will prevent us infected? 

Will prevent us spreading it? 

Will prevent serious cases? 

Will prevent deaths? 

Will prevent mild cases? 

What heart, brain, organ damage seeing even mild/asymptomatic cases? prevented vaccine? Even dropped 70-80% would still major success think Nice bullshit article. long people try bargain reality, ruminating same, easily debunked superficial numbers, lowest level reasoning mathematical prowess?

Standard define leading cause death. Germany, pathologist criticising pandemic measures admit leading cause death Covid-19 90% cases, institute autopsy study nearly 200 patients.

If one excludes contributing factors, number course much lower. asthma noted contributing factor.

That change IFR, dangers getting crippled it, overloaded hospitals, nothing.

Get better contribute something meaningful, silent obey. True herd immunity reached sometime 2022 2023

This simply mathematically line numbers terms vaccine doses available, willing take it, vaccine coverage required given particular efficacy, numbers already infected. 

It's evident put lot thought post, worthless none based actual data. feel like Trader Joes believes super traditional approach grocery shopping part branding source customer loyalty. They‚Äôve notoriously refused evolve unlike grocery chains, especially delivery store pick up. Look website compared national chain like Vons/Albertsons Ralphs. TJ website primarily feature recipes, store locator online newspaper. normal retailer straight ‚Äúhere‚Äôs products, add cart we‚Äôll bring you‚Äù. 

Of course branding/aesthetic definitely works considering fucking popular TJ is, definitely frustrating. trump actually fascist would seized complete control US-

Trump haters ok Authoritarianism long supports morals/values/beliefs. agree ... go store..and least local store PA won‚Äôt let anyone without mask .. moth cell grown spike subunit vaccine... non-genetic vaccine...

Whatever else happens, whole experience incredible opportunity learn bunch fascinating shit I'd never even imagined before. Uhh. wont. Dont wanna catch covid right vaccine given. get meanz announced every hospital state must draw list retired staff call on.
 

The party calls trump fascist. giving convalescent plasma first 3 days symptom onset? 

I know answer yes, go choosing gets doesn‚Äôt people don‚Äôt get severely sick till day 7-10? even considering high cost treatment well fact requires IV infusion infusion center hospital. 

Unfortunately, convalescent plasma isn‚Äôt answer that‚Äôs going work us. fact high-profile people haven‚Äôt died ISSUE you?  Viral loads appear major factor outcome. 

The worst outcomes happen constant contact virus, like family members living together.

Here‚Äôs hoping make speedy recovery Nice job keeping family safe/informed. try educate folks vaccine stuff often Sure Fauci....Just let know ready - essential worker here. Thanks. dishonest trying suggest average mild cases COVID-19 mild average cold flu. I'm curious lil' something regarding mRNA vaccines. keep hearing/reading internet nay-sayers/anti-vaxxers new technology safe alters DNA. I'm curious much true, is, serious us human beings. 

I'm anti-vaxx whenever vaccine rolled out, happily jab slowly get back normal life virus thing popped world. I'm curious argument keeps popping me, social media, even people work can't stand idea vaccine. Hopefully someone enlighten lil' bit. Thanks advance!!! could be.

It could give us bit normalcy nearly third country immune.

Couple two vaccines, masks, social distancing might run hospitals next year.

It‚Äôs getting tricky. can't get past fact we've seen mass graves cities, trucks filled dead bodies, things promised ""Couldn't Happen Here,"" yet we're *still* marching school fine. name God continue live knowing fellow man comfortable this? Total guess would say America head shoulders rest world lack taking disease seriously culture. live slums India already used outbreaks disease. would definitely show kind saw thanksgiving many Americans appearing defy virus. indian poor know get ill family dont eat. America seemed lose plot november thing growing exponentially gets beyond certain number virus wins seems USA. suggesting answer would love know. Well lets hope dont go back capacity before. would total letdown nightmare part 2. Agreed. reason economics. limited number consumers inoculation one time (or maybe annual) thing drug maker going whatever get vaccines market quicker drug makers. calculate reproduction rate. Moderna go people rural locations Ah that‚Äôs fun thought. love scene mistaken. absolutely *is* enough say something meaningful statistical sense, cannot say ""100% effective."" confidence interval ~%80-100, still pretty astounding. want live like move china dude. Dont ruin people want freedom.  makes think moderna distributed rurual places phyzer urban apparent ever actually go hospital, ever gone classes HS/college nurse students. chunk genuine ambitions medicine careers, huge chunk go nursing reason people try get CS: ""hot"" industry easy job get into. educated high-job-market professions there, nursing far easiest one coast into.

In experience many hospitals I've delivered back pizza guy classmates back college, mention time admitted ER...nursing lowest bar medical, one many people really care/have ambitions anything personal lives drawn to. kind default, easy mindless career lot people, even lack real empathy.

All said, mean disparage actually awesome nurses, either real career ambitions actually empathy expect someone healthcare position have. loads don't, they're first thing thought outside working food service/retail. virologist, epidemiologist, physicist, aerodynamics scientist, even infectious disease expert?

If not, I‚Äôm struggling understand appeal authority not. careful man. dad works residential construction allot outdoor environments subs allllot outbreaks. mean people would voluntarily lived physically psychologically self-destructive way, Fauci would better news us Christmas? supposed sacrifice lives health Fauci news? think confused Santa Claus. Coronaviruses actually make minority common colds. Somewhere around 15%, 4 coronaviruses cause common cold symptoms. 3 known infect humans cause SARS, MERS, Covid-19. 

The vast majority caused rhinoviruses. 

It mRNA could work rhinoviruses similar way, could work rather single one, could potentially world changing. 

If work single rhinovirus likely worthwhile pursue. Nobody wants get 100+ vaccines, cut number colds get half.

Also, side effects trial generally bad worse common cold. worth case alternative catching covid potentially dying long term health effects. side effects cold vaccine cold symptoms entire thing pointless. Dammit cant go final wave unemployment spikes again....Gonna kill me, jobwise.  that's leading world deaths infections. People get worked sample size. think Bayesian Probability says result massively robust. True. could ask see receipts worried. case people I'm worried trusted person living would tell they're lying UK person wandering - 28 days doeses two weeks second dose bed in? Realistically get anybody immunity January/February earliest that's assuming there's supply medical staff sitting around waiting stick good stuff. Ends site ain't going quick.


What troubles Moderna one needs stored extremely low temperatures it? What's consequences gets warm? anyone know - interested. Heck, even Herman Cain still deadly... downplay tragedy happened assume prior knowledge whether vaccine works. vaccine could placebo could even made disease worse. point trial injected don‚Äôt know anything could happened. I'm familiar basic stats (not much beyond that), get outlier position. I'm still left conflicted, huge population people. states, people tested (the vast majority). seems though affluent sick ones tested. would like know definitively average community stacks slums India, considering average community member, yet tested. I'd like either confirm deny theory we've already virus, many believe around year now. Basically, I'd like see mass testing would stack selective testing that's dictating majority data set points. Protect everyone COVID-19, matter cost! article claiming large stores primary route transmission. article states deep dive contact tracing period Nov 10. - Nov. 16. short time frame findings showed 55% infections could traced back big box retailers.

This mean primary route shopping big box stores. confirm virus aerosolized exposing large amount people public lead transmission. Even mask social distanced. think make recommendation send fda commissioner. commissioner decides. Idk that‚Äôs right checked website. Mainly Pete Burns. Antivaxxers listen up! Ok definitely two sheets layered exit end. Seems working fine far! apartment mostly smells like fresh laundry I'm it, hahaha. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* dont understand. Like cashier actively eating checking out? That's gross even without covid. 

But risk relatively low I'd imagine. That'd big ass wall. Probably done certainly overwhelmed are, be... Except it‚Äôs like one done thing. Revoking license take literal years state board fails revoke, license holder often sue lost wages. Science incredible. knew would come vaccine--because literally entire world working it--but far, turning much better expected. fundamentally disagree 7wk1110, love you‚ù§ Totally. think best lesson look many people get infected, seriously mess lungs, many people die every day. 

I mean, 200 000 people get infected, thousand deaths daily, need? Even overblown, conservatives say, still high.

Is politics fucks thinking, IQ general? 

Are ignorant? 

All above? local vet still brisk business, they've really made effort work effectively pandemic. one comes office, instead drive numbered parking lot, phone name. masked vet aide comes car takes pet, vet calls back discuss. 

We household full pets (5 cats 2 large dogs) places we've past 10 months grocery store vet's office. Pfizer and/or Moderna vaccines conventional mRNA Self Amplifying saRNA? would effect likelihood ADE?

Also, assumed trials would found ADE going occur. would appreciate expert could weigh in. ADE likely occur two months vaccine administered? know long-term safety synthetic mRNA? Honest question. Seems like really fine line playing genetics telling cells Um. What? Thats good news  dont know even make next Spring vaccine goes wide release....   Apparently left word ""third"" :) think there's lotttt people still going eat imagining. like 5 people bar since reopened. Yes really is. problem explanation. learn something new. try remember dying save millions others instead dying wrong side 50/50 equation. fair everybody else placebo group. That's interesting. Perhaps get vaccine, could work minimizes exposing patients.

Frankly, treatment, I'd vastly prefer treated staff vaccine. suppose patient know unless awkwardly asked them. Absolutely abhorrent you‚Äôre blaming healthcare workers literally hospital admin wouldn‚Äôt even allow us mask outside COVID rooms late April. outbreaks blamed staff rather issues many management departments refused fix atrocious.

The vast majority us trying fucking best John Jane doe go restaurants every weekend refuse mask all. rest US acting like joke you‚Äôre blaming healthcare workers. Incredibly dense based handful tictocs. Thanks greedy business owners, half population deemed essential workers could force us work case shut downs.

I work factory makes window parts nice pretty letter car saying boss greedy fuck would stay home watch us die. Well ones using old technology rather new mrna technique. Proud overcoming making excellent choice lifestyle. healthier tons benefits beyond day percentage weight scale would love see everyone understand make decisions help short long-term. Financial incentives hugely effect medicine done. Jack Wennberg proved 60s. It‚Äôs well documented time since. 


Notice payment procedure changes, drastically effect whether it‚Äôs done less. People still taking seriously. speed limits seat belts air-bags supposedly keeping us safe? Almost soon. Murica yeah! Already GOT corona I‚Äôm gonna get damn thing. way going shit again. assume entire USA infected point. Fauci might aswell stop speaking cause smart already know dumb care point keep making. realize people desperately want return life knew March 2020 going happen summer fall 2021. People need prepare another 5-6 months this. I'm saying risk anything assume, speculating possibility. happen see reflected stats active infections start drop. trying find information think (for UK passports anyway) chip written without destroying it. security feature biometrics could tampered with.

Even understanding wrong chip writeable, responsible adding vaccination details? every Boots/CVS/etc. even local doctor going get secure RFID encoder?

Then every airport need update reader's software able recognize new data field check status boarding. 

For UK another step would introduce passport checks exit currently visual check airline staff gate. many countries actually check biometrics exit? Many would massive hardware acquisition project too.

A simpler option would app securely authenticated contains persons vaccine test history. Even data security privacy concerns way go available.

Basically time get place, along required international agreements, people vaccinated already. least beach spread out. Going visit people houses bit worse. Tell us flat Earth! truly remarkable unaware effects actions. Twitter, someone related first person wrote shared ignorant tweet covid rise people aren‚Äôt wearing masks following protocol, flu isn‚Äôt rise people wearing masks following protocol. think failed remember that, although isn‚Äôt full proof, there‚Äôs vaccine flu... ignorance astounding. Yeah, community stop loving remote learning turned complete utter joke. improved much year either. People expect results, 4 20 minute online classes worksheets created else. Ironically, first primarily us made vaccination. great news American. Sending hope frontlines  So... working class people living close contact eachother less sanitary conditions? *not* military following science convinced decisions based political pressures. Dr. Fauci lied beginning masks anyone ounce science background knew good advice. Again, eye protection also necessary gets little TV time. Again, anyone little science knowledge knows that. understand airborne anyone knows rue either. Schools spreaders idiot science background knows yet keep saying aren't. faith people position power guide us safely! decent person. went big ten university. classes degree clinical laboratory science exactly pre-med classes. nurses ‚Äúnursing chemistry‚Äù, ‚Äúnursing biology‚Äù, etc. less rigorous. Don‚Äôt get wrong, admire nurses, fair amount aren‚Äôt top IQ ladder. It‚Äôs true, play percentages, bell curve overwhelmingly leans away early especially latter part 14 day quarantine.  risk (potential infections) : reward (compliance, economic stability, basic life functioning) may really brainer here.  remember looking chart one article day 9 % people long incubation time believe 1%. every 100 healthy people give to, 100 still spreading virus vulnerable. need protect vulnerable first. That‚Äôs way reduce deaths. true. Doctor nurse different jobs, smart nurses. needs made parody! university implemented required testing students, faculty staff returning campus Christmas holidays.

There ‚Äúuniversity sanctions‚Äù don‚Äôt comply.

No explanation means enforce it.

How much want bet nothing? students don‚Äôt give shit.

We working home online classes.

I work IT, virtual infrastructure working flawlessly I‚Äôm tired coming keep ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù appearances. Pft. Melbourne lockdown cut virus cases 100%. like people eat seed grain draft animals famine: actively sacrificing recovery. Even reason feel optimistic! It‚Äôs always way.

The queen ate potatoes convince people weren‚Äôt peasant food.

People people always been, pretend willfully ignore realities human society. Logic without accounting human condition faulty logic best. certain, generally least last duration pandemic, probably years longer. small percentage people might get reinfected (mostly due immune system issues) nothing substantial. Reinfection likely lead light symptoms.

The lack antibodies also mean protected anymore. 

Don't listen comments online saying friends reinfected, rare. Oh please. plenty articles stating vaccines won‚Äôt readily available public large least 3 months. Seriously: anything negative all? sounds great. yet smoking contributes weight loss. People downvoting you, believe widespread all.

However, think happen well. private practices, faced choice exaggerating couple people's conditions closing practice choose former.

I think many people told outright lies, maybe biopsy recommended scan, blood work, monitoring fine (for example). Maybe recommend house procedures instead things get local hospital.

Honestly, people always get second opinion non emergency medical procedures anyway. doctor could sham, may know latest treatments/procedures may better options you. may even come knowing equipment medical centers have. work dietary aide local nursing home currently 4 half years.

Recently we‚Äôve surges cases come pretty controlled thank goodness due isolation. However many people that, like person, wanton disregard lives others.

As aide pandemic, give paper product trays supposed come back (as given covid positive residents.) came back, guessed it, paper products. far heated argument I‚Äôve people may add college degree medical training, give disregard minimum wage working individual who‚Äôs lives risk every day, like many people world pandemic, want to, to.

Be wary are, never forget around you. Oh wow, absolutely reckless amazing marketing time. fucked. ppl (US) obsessed idea state officials shutting businesses ""communists"". sort marketing would really work here. probably already somewhere. It‚Äôs dumb another comment many votes says one forced vaccinated. 

Yeah, guess that‚Äôs okay they‚Äôre willing confined residence covid-19 eradicated. 

Keep kids schools, stores, public transport, doctors dentists‚Äô offices, airplanes... They're ones likely die, yes. Obesity, lack thereof, real Asian countries badly affected Covid West. WHY. Also feel like messaging rising number COVID cases US already saturated willing ears, remains ineffective convincing people still flagrantly violate public health warnings. think taking look back various vaccines history give confidence. memory fuzzy think one Swine Flu vaccine 70's raised ones chances getting another long term medical condition like 1 1,000,000. Overall, biggest risk lack effectiveness vs growing third arm getting mutant cancer 20 years. fill hospitals nobody working essential workers. I'm sure people get food drugs such, sensational. 

There getting around reality healthcare systems get overwhelmed crank restrictions more. Healthcare core infrastructure workers businesses. like trying go work without electricity gas. going work matter feelings tell you. 26 confirmed reinfections. thousands unconfirmed reinfections due lack saved samples first test. love people fundamentally disagree them. COVID minor illness compared flu. real problem lies brand new virus transmittable humans. Statistically, yes, overwhelming majority people what's classified ""severe"" case COVID requires hospitalization. However, novel virus means without proper precautions (masks/social distancing/all things we've hearing months) success vaccine distribution virus freely hopping nearly everyone come contact body equipped fight yet. small percentage massive group people still terrifyingly large. becomes major problem finite resources treat end worst disease offer. Include death penalty crime Novavax‚Äôs moth cell grown spike subunit vaccine finished enrolling UK phase 3, may non-genetic vaccine start new year well. I've lost respect many friends year. March one better friends started ranting virus fake started talking it. told HIV real.

I informed uncle died HIV loved much. last time spoke.

I'm interested friends people living alternative delusional reality. play card way getting back life extensive apologies reckoning reality. Dr. Anthony Fauci probably patient man planet. hasn‚Äôt gone nuclear year beyond me. Report her. could kill someone. though? Can't trust lame stream media! heard fake. Yeah surprised see that. Anyone insight why? Celebrities constantly traveling always mobbed fans kind high risk group matter what. climate change end world? earth fine humans driving half planet extinction turning earth Mars-like atmosphere apocalyptic.  I‚Äôm okay people forced take vaccine long they‚Äôre okay barred stores, restaurants, public transportation, schools, hospitals, airplanes... Another week closer hand pandemic, good vaccine news! It‚Äôs becoming Monday tradition rival Monday Night Football! Cant wait day late Spring/early Summer bonfire masks.

I‚Äôm trying find numbers production capacity vaccine, haven‚Äôt yet found (I know there‚Äôs initial numbers vaccines). Note din't say that. hallucinated slept sick covid. fine now. knows Yes, I‚Äôve waited line multiple times get TJ NY. Honestly lot compliance reasons safety reasons, guestimate 50% BS.

If trades worked closely together like crunch lot issues would work out. Normally representatives, meetings, minutes, meetings, etc. Yeah look like celebrity getting colonoscopy tv. shows it‚Äôs safe scary gets one person tested treated get far along it‚Äôs great thing. Hopefully bojo allowed 24 hour shopping spread people  family like you, needs enemies... given Regeneron neutralizing antibodies stop body producing immune response neutralizing antibodies. teachers given time support infrastructure virtual might good. But, everyone behaved though would weeks teachers patch together. least China doesn‚Äôt history that

You're sarcastic right? NFL can't bubble. One teams coaching staff around size whole NBA roster sometimes more. 32 teams 53 players 10 player practice squad. 63 players assitant coaches head coaches front office probably 20 people well. we'll say around 83 (more less) total people per team 32 teams. bubble would work. They've done pretty well far 3/4 season done. Yeah, available small number essential healthcare workers. reporting vaccines pretty bad pointing we're many months away widespread availability. city, Philly, made clear get-go earlier month weeks Thanksgiving. gatherings anyone outside household 1 Jan 2021. large crowd public events still cancelled 28 Feb 2021. Obviously know everyone follow guidelines convince least people follow &amp; right thing. asked doctor might expect get vaccine early asthma sent hypothetical order recipients smokers high list. guess might take smoking :( Don‚Äôt anything better than... actually probably don‚Äôt anything better do. US outside NY boring fuck Mild side effects. really important see one time, cost maybe never seeing again! research mentor used phrase ""a talking dog"" describe data compelling need complicated statistics describe it. 

As in, dog walks starts talking, alone significant.

30 severe cases placebo arm 0 vaccine arm ""talking dog."" That‚Äôs issue here. want force regular people taking vaccine that‚Äôs fine. medical reasons might extreme seizures. wonder far protection goes? Maybe 12 hours sick brother like 3, 61 year old father may best example us Reddit lol.

My father side effects both, brother second dose, interesting ""Why everyone good damn inconsiderate needs!"" Fuck mentality. used K12 teacher. teach college students teachers. think keep job. can't good conscience continue encourage go profession gaslights abuses members much. mean. Many people may want back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. I‚Äôm saying everything huge virtual components. Businesses won‚Äôt pay $75k Saturday meeting anymore get amount info 40k. Sure, can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs bad thing one took got severe covid. Trump given Regeneron neutralizing antibodies. stop body producing immune response neutralizing antibodies. Given disease progression recovery, doubt strong immune response. Tune later country flaming ruins. Way many people absolutely scientific knowledge made light this. say worked healthcare 35 years clinical laboratory scientist degree. It‚Äôs nonsense... wearing mask protects others protects you. balance of, point, low case numbers heavy use PPE hospitals, made best sense time. isn‚Äôt matter physical science social science, determine positive outcome people something. know better recommendations better now. wear masks. 
Mike skeezy boat party, doesn‚Äôt mean everything ever said false. I'd want neighbor know reported her. I'm asserting dominance preventing destroying lives others. wasn‚Äôt trial. brother father still wear masks, they‚Äôre less cautious rest us. probably means developed 20 potential vectors compatible viral data coming Wuhan. Possible still many variables know about, intentionally risk definitely vaccine within, conservatively let's say 1 year?

Like lot people think may gotten mild case (some people office awful cough, viral pink eye, sick weeks people traveled Washington late February cough nothing bad first 2 weeks lockdown) there's way knowing worth risk family. even think that. That's true. one patients, patient floor died contacted covid time hospital, could sue. 

I know would handled court. hope politicians went scientific/medical advice held accountable. 

Just note politicians. Australia new-Zealand island away rest world. literally walk China Portugal South-Africa. basically means measure slow virus. Meaning ""closed border""policy Australia NZ applicable rest world. long side effects last? legitimate question someone trusts scientific/medical community: anyone concerned potential long-term effects vaccines yet observed? read collective work put toward vaccine research would roughly ""equate"" years years research, something inside still little worried. (again - legitimate question reassuring comments appreciated!) wife couple oncology nurse.

That's consequence telling neighbours work... Moderna offer pick-up option?! 1st couple paragraphs mentioned teacher instruct I'm class, go home teach remote.
Why can't class? 
Its hard. Schools already wired internet
 Use webcam inexpensive flat screen. 

I saw years ago microsoft talking remote learning kids underdeveloped countries. take time, distribute vaccine vaccine work. common side effects vaccine üíâ feels 10000 worse covid trust shit felt like never ending Meanwhile schools Texas finding every loophole possible avoid admit spread schools. one point CDC defined known contact 15 minutes consecutively schools students stand play musical chairs every 14 minutes sitting next students 15 minutes time one tested positive school could say student contact 15 minutes time. CDC changed 15 minutes total suddenly spread schools lost little loophole. Class sizes may technically smaller, packed 2-3 classes one classroom teachers sick can't leave unsupervised rooms. count people refuse children tested never test positive never inform anyone school it. foreign corporate investors. Yup know many years training nurses get, I'll bet &lt;that years we'll start see dearth kinds medical experts.

Coz 2020, going see mess *want* send life direction?  mean I‚Äôd sleep fever, you‚Äôll sleep fine. 100% this. dude get statue something  Given 2 3 vaccines primed released, accelerate mass vaccination timeline, least US? might still early show positive test. negative encourage risky behavior. Ideally get tested still assume might positive even test negative people won't. They‚Äôve actually explicitly said vaccine prevent infection - symptoms (to knowledge yet). yes could well asymptomatic carrier vaccinated.

That keep saying still need follow social distancing masks etc vaccinated - least people protected. people volunteer know might get valid dose. whole point sure gets enough world class psychiatrists calling best thing kids

Why would assume this? Person buy car person afford. NEED loan tens thousands car, can't afford it. could find out. may save lives. correct. See post CDC link. major misconception here. COVID decent chance serious age. difference younger people endure serious damage older people can't. trial, back mind know helping science increasing risk infection. people heroes. I‚Äôve best temp screener, even people want argue me. idea many times come mask take getting past me, like hard wear it? 6 months? question always think read efficacy rates. possible numbers inflated things like social distancing wearing masks? know people actually exposed virus? curious this. I'm high risk, I'm essential worker...I assume among last vaccinated. quickly looking get 350 million people (while roughly 125 million think plot Bill Gates Fauci install tiny cell phones arms case lose phones, something like that)? Hmm. Well King Fauci know shit all. even listen him? Good lord, missing many points even know start.

More 94% people survive, sure, plenty survive serious health issues. vaccine prevent death, prevents serious infections thus subsequent health issues. also reduces number carriers, thus reducing number infections, thus reducing number deaths. enough vaccinated people, herd immunity takes effect shields vulnerable people vaccinated yet. Pump veinssssss get pharmacy could definitely ask carry choose go somewhere else it‚Äôs one you‚Äôd prefer

It‚Äôs healthcare workers won‚Äôt say they‚Äôll get whatever employer employee vaccination day I've read pretty easy educated guess got saline, expected side-effects (headache, tiredness, etc) happens real vaccine cases. Imagine dumbass throw party pandemic knowing consequences get fined 10 grand it. 

Have fun debt dildo world full shit. People forget theres much good vaccinated everyone town age 55+ first, would far less deaths.  

Also, honestly don‚Äôt know much vaccine prevent spread. infected vaccinated person still shed virus primed immune system fights off? must super busy volunteering help Covid wards over-run hospitals then!!

They're risk, way many already died, they're needed take care everyone else wait vaccine available all.  


Yes, morbidly obese people high risk severe/deadly case, technically morbidly obese practice methods keep safe possible (stay home, mask up, delivered groceries/outside pickup, etc.) medical professionals *just have* they're working.  


This seems wrong me. able alter humidity app. set 60%, measure 40% house. that, pretty interesting seems useful. I‚Äôm surprised political pandemic still pushed political hustler Fauci rest progressive Democrats. That's biggest concern January March. People actually might loose shit altogether vaccine horizon. R0 almost 4 all. vaccine good say is, won‚Äôt much worry get even moderate rollout say 60% population would likely put stop spread virus since would much smaller percentage population work with.

Also high risk population (at least vaccinated) work ones vaccinated first.

There mutations new viral threats matter think that‚Äôs best response could hope for.

For record: personally won‚Äôt getting - least right away until: it‚Äôs proven several years virus cases &amp; death rate spikes among yet vaccinated. live small town, work home, high risk see vaccine risky virus me. And, yes important vaccinations get regular flu shots. Well yeah, think open either.

The Supreme Court even called New York inconsistency. Like Trump? Right, he's dipshit many idiots listen him. Hard agree.  Reminds /r/nba tracked Dan Gilbert's plane go sign Lebron 2014 wondering study like done before, mode infection blocked? Wow that‚Äôs nuts. Sorry mom reaction
Yeah I‚Äôm 41 fully prepared wait. know (I work vast majority time device). Thank educating. :) statistic obese people condition fault used 1 300. decades ago know now. local hospital chain capacity 300 search, time numbers 100 sending back.

This happening many months knew great idea.

Plot twist : numbers double Nope clarify, Food method transmission. According CDC. VOte Ryan Leaf. could go wrong? told people vaccine coming next Monday, they‚Äôd still throw party Saturday. permitted take ibuprofen acetaminophen relieve symptoms? divide current deaths state 0.5% give rough idea many cases could be. 10X NYC, 3X California. Wisconsin 2X (per another conversation thread).

Now average death rate indeed lower 0.5% could more. False Watching China Italy try respond made wonder going crazy US West Coast. like World War broke anywhere else world, watching wondering WTF response. realizing preparing pandemc preparing category 6.5+ earthquake (likely occur within lifetime Pacific Northwest) world war. unprepared for. ate boring food stores and, really poor predisposed going hungry maladaptive stress response, I've hard time stocking again. \[/anecdote\]

I fatigued. Yes, it‚Äôs still possible perform new study coming months possibly get added distribution mix around March April Brutal. way sex workers treated awful.

Appreciate reply! find Twitter thread I'd interested worries not. 0.1% serious infection rate entire cohort, serious infection rate subset got sick. serious infection rate healthy population (at least trial). can't apply 0.1% rate 196 sick, correlation two values.

30/196 = 15% serious infection rate contracted disease.

Consider 100 people 10 apples, 1 green 9 red. could say 1% people going get green apple. true 10 people getting apples, 10% subset get green apple, 1%. We're getting emails hospital work says they're planning distributing vaccine us December 15th-17th. Midwest. Sorry got sick! fun. bad *cold* month ago obliterated us worrying covid. tested negative thankfully. thing fun.

And agree you. Vaccinating immunocompromised wont slow spread. however lower death count dramatically. 

Then could focus spreading disease vaccinating greater risk community transmission.

Frontline workers example. Post office workers, teachers, etc. guess distinction communities disproportional impacted spread COVID-19 see claim made paper spreading disease anymore groups get disease. original comment made seem like minorities kind superspreader group feel like mischaracterization data researchers suggest much increased spread traced increased size households living building result poverty. surprised.. hallucinations flu years ago.. anytime body wiped mind play tricks you. Darth Vader shoulda wore mask... Frankly, surprised repossessions already rising quickly, ditto personal bankruptcies signs severe financial distress. Restrictions evictions foreclosures may part answer. people may paying bills money would used pay rent mortgage. doubt enough account seemingly low levels arrears bankruptcies. (Pressure food banks, etc points trouble. signs trouble appear obvious.)

The US economy hammered spring lockdown subsequent lower consumer spending driven pandemic pandemic-related layoffs yet usual indicators households struggling mixed.

It two months since enhanced unemployment benefits ended. believe - even everything stayed - huge recession resulting debt-laden consumers losing jobs right around corner. 

As things stand, expect potentially calamitous wave layoffs, business failures, etc. sometime March. pandemic spreading control U.S. Public health experts seem agree - even many people travelled Thanksgiving - case numbers, hospitalizations deaths would risen sharply (unless businesses made close sharply limit capacity). course, Thanksgiving turned busy airports. (And safe assume many people took highways.)

The health consequences - least - impossible predict precision. huge waves people become ill - even need hospital care - economy hammered. hospitals EMS become overwhelmed standards healthcare compromised ambulances cannot respond promptly emergencies, economic cost astronomical - would restrictions necessary attempt recover situation implemented.

Sadly, believe alone thinking next four months going historically awful - number reasons including health economics probably host others. Oh, 100% agree need put off. keep hospitals/doctors clear work people need Surely they're losing draft picks point think one big issues undefeated season that's going, think decision would much easier. That's reasonable. I'd probably use something like 0.4% Wisconsin hit hard around September. Much better treating now.

Wisconsin weird state too. major metropolitan areas, those, particularly Milwaukee, lots multi generational housing.

Things may much worse Milwaukee much better elsewhere (relatively). Due size Milwaukee may drive numbers quite bit. Could still bad rural areas cases dropping urban dropping overall look.

Hard remind large regions deceiving. That‚Äôs needed appointment, thinking wisely. hope don‚Äôt need ambulance ride either. rephrase, saying studies recommend daily dosing, irregular dosing cause body reject vitamin? Since covid started I‚Äôve still working office, think get point mandate working home? I'm you. Cases rapidly increasing area, local hospital full. almost always people gone work covid. would much rather limit risk try best make work every day go person dining.  everyone thinks like tho. biggest covid denier know 75 keeps talking restaurants. say protestors blm want, restaurants open. watch news, keep busy work, house cars. extra time hate people. prevent positive test results, though, right? understanding Astrazeneca vaccine unlikely approved US studies done due errors original study. friend male nurse said thing worrying back move overweight patients.. hospital spend money sort apparatus would help yeah we‚Äôre gonna watching tv 2 commercial come say ‚Äúif someone know contracted covid-19 may qualify settlement‚Äù Ravens fine equal game checks players, plus fifty percent. used fund teams players equivalent giving entire week salary charity well  think look doctor‚Äôs eyes says all. He‚Äôs got thousand yard stare.  sanity check though, cousin postive coronavirus test result back April, symptoms? may another virus thdt got back then. unless swapping new mask Aren‚Äôt vaccines 40-70% effective? like superb right? right. assumed swiss Austrian. bad. lots reasons sex workers discussed length. independent contractors high turnover industry one thing prevents unionization (in porn industry, average career length 6 months, stripping slightly longer.) Dancers move different clubs get different work plus lot survival work it‚Äôs looked much (even posting sex work undoubtedly get shitty PMs here.) 

One big issues ownership liquor licensing. places lot political control gets license. Unfortunately, means control give licenses local level give buddies sex workers. I‚Äôll find twitter thread one girl broke trying Seattle hard was. know, actually could people vaccine group would died reversed vaccine, lived. We'll never know way around.

Getting enough people get damn shots create herd immunity gonna struggle. Estate sales happen someone dies. Kentucky re-elected guy, Republican Senators still support Republicans still hold majority.

The first two gonna change, there's still chance last one. Georgia two Senate runoff elections January. Democrats win get majority (with VP tie-breaker). know Georgians, tell vote! hear you, ... i've found lot idiots advanced degrees well. extremely hard ""teach"" common sense wisdom collegiate classroom. California worse, bad case numbers severe restrictions year destroyed economy Hones questions, really make big statement 11 people? Yikes. That‚Äôs downvote I‚Äôve gotten since joining. actually Saracastic lol seen another article estimating case undercount 8fold. true, would mean 30% corresponds 12.5 million confirmed positives, less number already recorded 13.75 million, corresponding almost exactly third. number confirmed cases along lines much reasonable 17.5 million year-end, would correspond 42% population.  Uh, what? Anyone could signed met minimum qualifications, tested negative covid. true all. agree 1000%.

Unfortunately, organ transplant recipients, aids patients, immunocompromised folks get benefit vaccine. way protect covid everyone around vaccinated.

Those fucktards still going kill people selfish stupid. would suggest since seem know all? First non trial shot can't tenth US already said approve anything meeting stop embarrassing yourself. want wallow misery basement forever that‚Äôs nobody stop makes sense, reality vaccine research candidates fail. data vaccine development failure rates, doubt many failed projects might even published. comment denialism, rather skepticism given history vaccine research production.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know readings normal, readings devastating,‚Äù Candi said.

Her oxygen level 85% days, said. Normal readings least 95%. became lethargic, described mental health ‚Äúdelirious‚Äù lack oxygen.

‚ÄúAt time, didn‚Äôt know passing couldn‚Äôt stay awake,‚Äù Candi said. ‚ÄúThere time slept 18 hours straight kept falling asleep telling sleep, wake days I‚Äôll better. body heal itself, body wants sleep.‚Äù

Her dog, Tika, kept coming room barking her. Candi said she‚Äôs glad let Tika kept licking Candi‚Äôs face wake up.

 Candi Tika
Candi Brings Plenty, 39, dog Tika. Candi said grateful dog Tika woke multiple times hospitalized COVID-19 journey.

Candi noticed feet palms began turn white mouth turning blue. Candi texted daughter told needs go emergency room. daughter asked call ambulance.

‚ÄúThere moment didn‚Äôt want wake up,‚Äù Candi said. ‚ÄùI didn‚Äôt want call ambulance didn‚Äôt want traumatize daughters. didn‚Äôt feel needed ambulance, took seven hours get bed. kept falling back asleep dreaming went emergency room.‚Äù

When eventually made emergency room without help ambulance, Candi admitted right away caregivers checked vitals.

‚ÄúThe doctor came told went sleep, would one COVID-19 victims fell asleep didn‚Äôt wake up,‚Äù Candi said.

Candi said ‚Äúvery impressed‚Äù doctors caregivers took care Monument Health sick COVID-19.

‚ÄúThey warm comforting,‚Äù Candi said. ‚ÄúI would think health care workers would kind fear close, comforting.‚Äù

While hospitalized, Candi left TV hospital room high volume barely slept.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt sleep window, would see nurses, even nurse, go running. Sometimes would walking take running,‚Äù Candi said. ‚ÄúIf didn‚Äôt TV on, could hear different alarms would hear horrible things.‚Äù

At one point, Candi could hear person room adjacent ‚Äúcoded,‚Äù went cardiac arrest.

‚ÄúThat really hard comprehend you‚Äôre fighting life,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúI watched (the staff) overworked.‚Äù

The South Dakota Department Health called check Candi‚Äôs symptoms 10 days onset hospital.

‚ÄúThey asked, symptoms start? People could say anything don‚Äôt want quarantine,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúI felt like weren‚Äôt strong resource community. relatives said (their) 10 days DOH released (them isolation), they‚Äôre still coughing symptoms. feel like part reason we‚Äôre spreading COVID-19 way are.‚Äù

‚ÄòI still nightmares‚Äô

Candi said feels illness longer two weeks she‚Äôs oxygen right may stay oxygen rest life.

‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm still impacted it,‚Äù Candi said. ‚ÄúI lung damage waited long, oxygen levels low long. didn‚Äôt realize causing organ damage.‚Äù

She hospitalized second time COVID-19 journey due lung infection. still wears oxygen tank. Candi still hasn‚Äôt regained taste smell, said PTSD illness.

‚ÄúI still bad dreams nightmares able wake night,‚Äù Candi said. ‚ÄúIt horrible know almost allowed another COVID-19 death.‚Äù

Candi said someone survived COVID-19, she‚Äôs upset enough CARES Act money went people directly impacted pandemic instead went businesses.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs millions dollars there, it‚Äôs people need most,‚Äù Candi said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs even people, it‚Äôs economy. really upsets me.‚Äù

While Native Americans disproportionately hit COVID-19, Candi said sees pandemic ‚Äúbiochemical warfare weapon.‚Äù

‚ÄúElders fighting chance COVID-19 leaving us way soon,‚Äù Candi said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve lost many elders, many prominent wisdom keepers medicine people. youth struggling much.‚Äù

Candi lost grandmother, Florence Ten Fingers, COVID-19. Traditionally death ceremonies four days long, Candi noted, grandmother‚Äôs ceremony two hours long.

Candi said ultimately, believes tribal lockdowns best response state attacking tribes attempting dismantle sovereign border patrol taking care Oyate.

‚ÄúWe knew going happen. What‚Äôs happening trying prevent,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúNow we‚Äôre rate I‚Äôm witnessing two three relatives dying COVID-19 day.‚Äù Half million deaths mostly old people price he's willing pay keep economy going. would satisfy you? 

Maybe could vaccinate sample 8 billion people see many get severe COVID. I'm sure it'd hundreds least. Business owners money grubbing con men upset abuse workers right now.

Look, make disingenuous arguments too. I‚Äôm RN also went Covid PPE shortage. Good Fauci keeps trying. kinda give general public. sub seems intelligent folks places, think need prepare rather nasty weeks ahead. 

Take care families. sucks nurse right now. sucks Covid stuck home. worse IMO inpatient. want hospital right now. swear children things sacred many hospitals staffed it‚Äôs good situation. patient loads already insane, burned out. can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôll like couple weeks. strain healthcare system hoax.

Candi made sure stay home quarantine exposure continued isolate home test came back positive. Despite best efforts, several relatives became sick COVID-19 matter days.

‚ÄúI relatives living time temporarily staying me, shocked quick infected five people almost one day stopped house,‚Äù Candi said.

Her brother, sister, niece, two daughters person entered Candi‚Äôs home without consent tested positive COVID-19 short time.

‚ÄúI watched spread like wildfire,‚Äù Candi said. ‚ÄúTo day, still feel horrible watching impacted relatives take time work lost paychecks, effort worked towards‚Äù staying safe COVID-19.

Candi‚Äôs symptom onset began sleeping woke 5 a.m. freezing ‚Äúworst cold I‚Äôve ever felt.‚Äù put blankets, sweatpants hoodie couldn‚Äôt stay warm.

‚ÄúI knew moment, something wrong. could feel bones,‚Äù Candi said.

She took hot shower began feel nauseous. shower, laid felt body aches, sure signs COVID-19.

‚ÄúIt like came once,‚Äù Candi said. ‚ÄúFor me, weren‚Äôt body aches. felt like someone stabbing me. horrible. Later felt like lightning strikes. think it, feel like nerve pain. I‚Äôve muscle aches, horrendous.‚Äù

Soon felt fever. next day, felt coughing shortness breath. suffered symptoms home nearly week hospitalized.

Candi said ‚Äústrong network‚Äù friends, family neighbors sent care packages home supported two children sick.

‚ÄúMy worst case scenario hospital fighting life two children home, COVID-19 positive quarantining, scared,‚Äù Candi said. never see anything good coming TikTok people dying. dead people means houses going market, houses going market means contracts crap houses needs go somewhere. relatives don‚Äôt want sell gram-grams junk get called. national leadership instead leaving local politicians. Since needs two doses, still wonder drugs they're gonna pushing us. shitty takes always someone coddled works home want use image reply friends family facebook post standing freedoms ""living life without fear"". stop talking probably Homeless people may pretty high vaccine wait list. state, slated get vaccinated along migrant workers congregate housing teachers tier2 - right front line medical/first responders residents/staff nursing homes. Process takes long time. want cleared quicker. Bad people show fast hard times. It‚Äôs simple. pandemic really brought sociopaths ""friend"" group well March, highest amount daily cases \~25,000 entire country, though largely concentrated NY NJ. 

We five times number every single day spread nation. 

I'd say shit hit fan escalated even ever since first explosive outbreak back March, we're conditioned getting worse, even know exact moment agree things bad, many us see we've passed moment long time ago. Azar one said regular people April. one quote include piece mean say it. would unrealistic expect ""arms people Christmas"" mean ""all 330M Americans walk CVS get vaccine Christmas"". use stupid app teach calculus? serious? kids thrive home schooling agree would say majority would lot harder time. 1 81 chance getting *symptomatic* COVID. 

Not sure whether means literally symptoms COVID mild symptoms noticeable long-lasting enough tested, rather sporadic sniffle.

All ratios scale accordingly. Please ask source percentages? safe travel plane? believe that's true. Christmas shopping, Christmas gatherings, think deaths Thanksgiving peak around Christmas time, think deaths peak around 4-6 weeks Christmas. See tomorrow, homie! want see COVID statistics, broken political affiliation. What's infection rate Republicans vs. Democrats? know vaccine chose excessivly sensitive type person!??? 

 I'm sensitive every medicine (I Fibromyalgia) body reacts medicine others even think (like normal painkiller Ibuprofen) normal dental anesthesia shots - much can't even remove practise (dizzy, super low blood pressure, wreck!). 

I react strongly every medicine others doesn't, unfortunately. vaccine since child 100 years ago basic shots kids got, terrified body would react Covid-vaccine's side effects! 

Which version chose?? work airport. confirm, almost busy regular Thanksgiving week. long get COVID Long? Moderna vaccine also doesn‚Äôt require crazy cold temps remain stable like Pfizer one correct? I‚Äôve always said this. I‚Äôve always pretty eat rich doctor way different investor.

My orthopedic drives mclaren 720s. Buuut cut open spine. good job too. know? Fair play. hope enjoys hell it. Sadly see many nurses health professionals attitude disregard coronavirus. Don‚Äôt get started police officers know... bit drastic OK guess I'm lucky? I've never side effects flu shot. even soreness ton people complain about. Heres hoping COVID shot goes same, ay? disagree this. Lol. long voice disgust government employers us demanding need. reason suspicious strong results different drug trials returned closely together? Moderna could fluffing numbers Pfizer vaccines basically here? America national teacher shortage 40 years now! went school become teacher however, financially viable option graduated. told professors going field two literally cried told room. schools trained teacher. emergency hires passed laughably easy certification tests states have. COVID sweeps country even less teachers schools. think right; wonder quickly vaccinate seriously vulnerable 10M aged 85 prevent severe disease turn tide slightly.  Sounds like something get Friday makes sense. getting contracts Covid??? nurse think grounds state board nursing suspend license. important. dangerous time since people lot pandemic fatigue promising news vaccine put people ease. virus prevalent. expect double doses Jan, going forward. candidates expect production billion 2021 No. Clearly infected person picked outside home. spreads 3 family members home. family members visit family, could spread 10 family members. extreme example shows 1 14 people actually got shopping. 

All takes 1 person get outside home run family. positive cases come from, according studies. Please forgive lack sources I've seen time time sub news. Let‚Äôs rumble!

Now, stop crying fight father. I'm starting really like Mondays daughter think able take vaccine, worries me. Based side effects think much medically fragile. Hopefully enough people willing take community. eat lot paint chips kid? I'd absolutely thrilled 75-80% efficacy severe COVID.  quote literally stands identifying theoretical ""vectors"" instead vaccine candidates Biontech already tested rodents.

The definition ""Vaccine think Pfizer research behind BNT162b2? Nobody claims that, read everywhere Pfizer heavy lifting regarding production, human testing responsible get vaccine approved. doubt played essential role. still, company development official time table problem, labor love speak mind. still take time mental health reasons never push point burnout (been type work 30 years now, learned lesson).

Take care! Probably not: assuming mortality rate using close accurate, still necessarily mean 300,000 deaths year end since mortality rates lagging indicator. 

If 300,000 deaths year end, would almost certainly mean either mortality rate higher estimated number infected people even higher Gottleib estimates.  Always fun watching posts sources information narrative getting downvoted without comment. Yep, p value indication assuming treatment impact chance would get result far away same. p value incidents &lt;.0001 confident random luck. believe large scale shut see fear anger comes realization government backs affected measure. It‚Äôs disgraceful. It‚Äôs ridiculous US government given 1 measly stimulus since started. one, think,  Mommy said quiet nothing nice say, peace out. Sweden Switzerland place. Good example use long article add confusion. mutates deadly strain call western plague That‚Äôs great, I‚Äôd also like pony. seriousness- tier system good we‚Äôre going get given limited political people. proper Asian / NZ style lockdown, put real teeth enforcing restrictions.

We things though within framework: indoor dining / bars, all, matter level tier county - opening usually causes local spike. guess point wonder diagnosis back year , still count it? alternative? Stay home 2+ years? going happen. go eventually get covid? know anyone would prefer disease shown long term negative side effects vs possibly undiscovered side effect. FIL'S neighbor active lady covid, transferred long term care facility. Basically waiting hoping everyone else gets vaccine provides long term immunity nothing else makes sense. BORG much? Oh, fat clearly affects severity. Like fat many conditions/ infections. enough squash people taking it, main thing. vaccine widely available, restrictions gone people choose take harm themselves. There's sick people America still go work. way we're stopping even try Poland stopped testing asymptomatic. Even symptomatic go testing avoid quarantines (police checking daily). Even reporting deaths best iffy. Hospitals flodded covid+ patients. situation dire media willing admit. another cycle 2-3-4 weeks later  careful thought, still managed get somehow.

Do live alone someone else? get dog watch shows made places gotten covid control. South Korea tv serials Australian soap operas? I‚Äôm assuming pilots ‚Äútested‚Äù product research purposes?  think comments show hard work china puts trying change story. Chances they're getting diet too, 250mg supplemented + get diet probably fine. hours public transit

I absolutely don‚Äôt understand haven‚Äôt since beginning. Everyone gets packed less buses/trains/planes Thursday Friday woke vomiting. Figured ate much, 4 hours - bathroom, throwing up. Got point throwing bile. 

Throat felt little raw since. fever (knocks wood), taste tact, slight tickle throat sometimes clear throat get tightness right side neck (by trap muscle). Stomach still little wonky. 

Mom sister keep telling I‚Äôm anxious raw throat throwing probably pulled muscle vomiting. Drip could change temperature lying day Friday... I‚Äôm still nervous. much me, worried may transmit mom. 

Does sound like Covid, simply stomach bug effects. Please spare downvotes I‚Äôm ridiculous. pandemic anxiety all-time high case, pandemic start country we've seen Spanish Flu, MERS, Ebola, Zika, Swine Flu, etc. simple bat taking shit another animal ends eaten human. origin country's ""fault"" then? course not. What's important country reacts control virus. Despite first outbreak detected China sequence genome less 2 weeks guidance treatment, detection, testing, etc, turned extremely minor contributor export cases around world. fucking good job there, people like can't bring admit that.  Oo fun idea likely thanks, gotta certain length comfortably front trip others I‚Äôm actually using it, rolling marshmallow tip makes things hell lot easier, white reflective tape helps stand I‚Äôve told. Sorry tangent trying keep Reddit better informed. Plus family pressuring get better one that‚Äôs integrated Google maps sensors overhead obstacles, since Covid leave house even less even didn‚Äôt enough worth it. they‚Äôll wondering found one didn‚Äôt pony better one...  Ha, stripper actually sucks much. independent contractor pay stage time end owing nights. big winners club owners, like brothels too. really really wish way sex workers collectively strip clubs instead would equitable, there's enough reddit comment prattle lol. Thank you!!!! vaccine distributions going happen based priority medical point view, vaccine reserved distribution open market? one expects anything Mississippi. wish internet companies weren‚Äôt these? Vaccines Ants!? answer last bit 2 words - saving face. 

Source: I'm Chinese myself. Diaspora. definitely is! Agreed. Ducking Bullshit that? Running trial manufacturing two different things. teachers: deserve parade national holiday over. can‚Äôt tell presence kids‚Äô lives, even virtually, brings sense normalcy us. shopping malls I've to, they've taken away mass seating like offered take out. I'd say 50% stores requiring people line outside wait, they're really enforcing capacity limits. Even ones maybe fraction capacity comparison would normally be. Overall, taken lot seriously here. is, going grocery store. 99% people wear masks mall try socially distance areas choke points. imagine living place like article, flipped majority people seem give shit. cut 27% ( 1 - (96/132)).

that means 73% original infections happen schools shops. right? wonder two bigger issue. wage family live one income much higher generally discussed talking living wages. European countries strongest social welfare systems highest wages possible maintain adults capable participating workforce so. stage show saw see puppets sex...wild stuff.  Yes! I'm quarantined exposed positive students. enough risks job, one them. get people coming from, reopen schools parents go back work may well open everything up. 

Reopening schools decision based welfare children, based economics. get cake eat too. 

Anecdotally, people know espouse ""kids need learn school!"" angle also espouse ""I want go back work"" ""I hate kids home"" opinion.

I mean, people need make money. it. Tho ""Pfizer's Coronavirus vaccine"", BioNTech's Coronavirus vaccine Pfizer merely manufactures distributes.

It's like calling iPhone ""Foxconn smartphone"".  Lol prove what. 

For first statement, look US Election map 2020. Rural voters chose duped racist billionaire salesman instead healthy socially conscious policies would benefit them, don‚Äôt understand interact bigger society ir races groups. generalizaitin undeniable trend. second statement, obvious fact cultures societies revolved around close knit villages, isolated homesteads. Lack community socializing major factor depression. isn‚Äôt clear? anything even remotely bad Captain Trips strikes, US *so* screwed even without helping hand Randall Flagg. luddite rebellion Okay mean mRNA vaccines proving effective compared ""tried true"". Idk would want one gives better also believe 90%+ claims, so......

The beauty science give fuck believe. essentially denying evidence presented vaccine safe effective that's bueno  I'm wondering effective going be. Everything I've read covid... I'm fully convinced going solution. long another pandemic? seems like many people literally give shits continue things shouldn't... know low income households work?

As rural...you've confused urban rural. rural local bus service. get populated areas rural areas, typically local bus service long distance (Greyhound). county local bus service populated areas, nothing part county. county adjoining one local bus service all.

Not unless talking school bus routes. Oh, state, kids young 5 legally required walk 1.5 miles school bus stop. live within 2 miles school, bus service. lot friends musicians families school age children. every right able work, safely, support families. love country keeping schools closed long term good reason.  glad someone addressed rural poor. rural poor urban poor poorer. Yes will.

Life going back normal vaccine widely available. took Australia 16 weeks control spread. ‚Äú3 weeks stop it‚Äù idea even come from? calling ""Pfizer vaccine"" distinguish two companies vaccine, Moderna AstraZenica. There's dark reason behind Basically opt spread diseases threaten health lives vulnerable, opt society. Seems fair me. Thank goodness lol too! placebo group, gonna vaccinate you? wait figure shit yourself?


Were nervous? many questions.    vaccine alone stop  ‚ÄúVirus shots‚Äù........there‚Äôs better way word (eg vaccinations) say I've seen countless times. Low serum levels vitamin bad. Next study follows vitamin supplementation randomized study, mortality change. result disappointed many times, made lazy, review latest studies. indeed, correct. latest studies shows positive effect. high dose. Roughly half bottle softgels. However, effects randomized study positive. Nurse small regional hospital, here. don‚Äôt get tested regularly. even got email ‚Äúcovid committee‚Äù hospital saying allowed (and expected) work tested positive weren‚Äôt symptoms (by tests seek ourselves). I‚Äôve never felt worthless nurse, human being. gotta kidding me. elderly vaccinated, still virus ~.08% mortality rate. told course life, .08% chance I'll die trivial things like seeing family friends, think I'd take chances? work film. We‚Äôre probably getting tested industry there. whole crew getting tested 3 times week current production. spaces disinfected multiple times day.

That's wild speculation part though, probably makes sense prioritize front line workers elderly/ immunocompromised. facts known since March so. People aren‚Äôt making mistakes, they‚Äôre making choices. sympathy people make dumb choices. really, believe not, you‚Äôre actions could impact people, choose care, doesn‚Äôt make fiction liberal anti-vaxxers too. aren‚Äôt emboldened like current strain conservative anti-vaxxers, they‚Äôre there. sound really sure collaborating mRNA vaccine program. says article linked BioNTech‚Äôs program actually joint venture. mRNA vaccine program, BNT162, collaboration BioNTech Pfizer develop potential COVID-19 vaccine 

So I‚Äôm sure believe, article linked :/ Lou's definitely good, also like Giordanos Gino's, Pequods like another level. Armands really good well, great thin crush. enough information make conclusion. find interesting hear anything big lawsuit. 

It seems determining cause would first step. ignored fucking Halloween. ‚Äòif someone dresses job don‚Äôt see it‚Äôs sexist eyes see that‚Äô 

They‚Äôre literally boat party, you‚Äôre surprised they‚Äôre swimwear? assume everyone see beach also porn star? 1. comes medicine, yeah do.
2. Oxford vaccine traditional vaccine uses adenovirus found chimpanzees.
3. two health issues found trial participants found unrelated vaccine.  Congratulations smoke-free!

I also ex-smoker, I‚Äôm 30-ish. deep respect lungs, everything they‚Äôve through. also serious trauma disorder dramatically worsened isolation. live alone, anticipation winter, spent summer trying build small bubble would see fully isolate otherwise, everyone‚Äôs definition ‚Äúisolate‚Äù seems include hanging random groups people going vacation. end it, despite efforts, didn‚Äôt pan out.

And it‚Äôs gotten every bit bad knew would, days. days suspect COVID would less painful continuing isolated.

But lot days would never want risk long-hauler. every day, matter much pain I‚Äôm in, would never able live one sickened someone like yourself, passed curse trauma nurse trying save you. could never live that.

And keeps right thing matter happens. I‚Äôve survived worse this, longer this. going let people‚Äôs complacency beat everything I‚Äôve lived through. thing ineptitude case? also need approved vaccines reach levels herd immunity within next year, iirc saying manufacturers make 5b doses end next year, person needs two

Not vaccines require two doses, single-dose. scientists saying Hydroxychloroquine mass media. Wisconsin here. Even worse Oh, starting rollout already? can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre still parroting mask talking point. Learn think, possible objectively wrong disingenuous lmao That's outliers sexy stories media gets paid based clicks ad revenue. ""schools looking okay"" headlines get much attention ""sky falling"" headlines. understand ""freedom"" comes sacrifice? kind people tout military serves protect ""your"" freedom country asking personally sacrifice good, unwilling freedom? disgusting definition ""freedom"" is. pisses end six years military ACTUALLY gave something country lockdown month wearing mask much majority citizens. 

And telling people find new home see differently you? disgusting example American. They've never made coronavirus vaccine though, that's issue. like Toyota making new Toyota. like Toyota making first airplane nobody made airplane before. Whataboutism seek explain away one injustice (e.g. gulags) match another, unrelated injustice (e.g. slavery). becomes impossible debate conversation, country society perfect. would context cry 'you're engaging whataboutism!' would make sense.

When lambasting someone *literally things doing* say ""wait, stuff bad, worse?"" that's 'whataboutism', that's called 'pointing blatant hypocrisy'.

As people China feel government COVID, think us - even like that've quite critical government - forced give high marks. Life back normal. travel (well, within China). hang friends family large groups. go movies. go bars. lot things true much rest world. Okay, sure, I‚Äôm talking Reddit entity staunchly allowing Americans getting credit vaccine development. many tests India point? :) Exchange cali literally state still true right?ü•∫ Canadians use Reddit too.  know someone whose friends working there, they've working asses thing. Kudos take 10k UI daily. Doctor's orders. 
Soooo toxic. depends everyone's individual circumstances different position US prior pandemic, still neither truly ""normal"". Lmao stay home forever guy gonna happen.

The FDA / CDC job sign vaccine report that's second week sitting desks... not. People done waiting. serious? Yes does. Try right now. .50 + .50 =1 interested, here's article this: bodies hundreds people died New York City Covid-19 surge spring still storage freezer trucks Brooklyn Many bodies people whose families can‚Äôt located can‚Äôt afford proper burial, according city‚Äôs Office Chief Medical Examiner. 650 bodies stored trucks disaster morgue set April 39th Street Pier Sunset Park.  could run trials Canada, would able manufacture vaccines ourselves. Nonetheless, we‚Äôve delayed millions doses vaccine weeks, certainly people die result. scientist. can‚Äôt say accuracy what‚Äôs right wrong. say outsider peculiar regulators need 3 weeks review Pfizer‚Äôs findings. We‚Äôre pandemic. get peer review team pore results fury intensity get done week, right? So, Pfizer production facilities US, increase number doses initially available US? I‚Äôm assuming US facilities producing vaccine long Belgium facility. kids virtual first semester crap show scholastically. We‚Äôre going back Jan unfortunately everyone else. really wish virtual worked better option. iMHO kids need f2f mine virtual isn‚Äôt cutting it. :( need y'all warning cause dumb. There's reason things called *public health* issues. Yeah, us (me included) afford mostly remove society put food table.

Many can't. Frontline workers, grocery store employees, many teachers expose put food table. wear masks, sanitize workspace, try keep distance someone COVID walks sneezes, might catch disease anyways. 

This especially important vaccine approved. work 5-10% population, herd immunity, protect people. lot people take vaccine, 5-10% people screwed. Fucking United airlines. One worse side effects Covid I've read lung lesions. Maybe doctor check out, perhaps x-ray something? read via twitter account Assuming million two doses per flight, that's like two days production.

Money fame get everything. rest us suffer.  reading earlier week. think ones left can't locate next That's... statistics works. Flipping two coins guarantee heads. found here: Wall Street Journal: Apparently we‚Äôre supposed to. Lots people saying ‚Äúplayed America‚Äôs little lapdog tried procure American European vaccines‚Äù yet they‚Äôre completely ignoring fact Chinese screwed us, despite us actual G7 country try vaccine dance them. want say, understand feel position sounds selfish, isn‚Äôt, all. want make wise choices don‚Äôt infect others ans take medical resources others need. want around love family aa long reasonably can.

Their shortsightedness ignorance selfish. You‚Äôre good person. 500+? Look hospitalisation numbers, consistently reliable metric what's happening ground. Completely ignore ""cases"", deaths, test counts, positivity rates - they're extremely unreliable paint good picture. hospitalisations lie. 7400 COVID hospitalizations California, whoever wondering

Also, Market Watch paywall now? rhetorical right? Man landed Chicago take months find bag. definitely damaged. That's bad time articles say ""dose"" mean one. correct answer nobody know people get vaccinated enough people exposed virus.

The expectation vaccine failures like common cold less like COVID/ARDS since still primed immune system even enough fully prevent it.

There's still dozen vaccine failures date, public information mild symptoms. look forward day D-level celebrity like polio vaccine. No. can‚Äôt feel difference one way other. didn‚Äôt feel though problem begin with. new endocrinologist noticed low routine check blood work shortly switched years ago. hadn‚Äôt said anything never would known. tried multi vitamins added additional daily supplements. levels didn‚Äôt increase started taking week prescription. vitamin levels range least. still metabolic problems. get enough D. leave there. make jokes.

That's way statistics work. people got vaccine randomized compared control group. matter precautions took long two groups differ statistically significant way other. probably assessed kinds things, age, job Covid risk, etc. Yeah he's sceptic says towards end. Vit hail mairy covid cure. Lol sub. Fauci gives like one press conference, quoted multiple newpapers one posted here. comment section:

Copied reply another user above, I'd interested hearing reply well.

Has doctor checking inflammatory markers? I'd curious see remain elevated experiencing chronic symptoms.

Also, seems commonality post covid syndrome mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS). know SARS-COV2 activates mast cells, many symptoms described post covid patients bang MCAS (Fatigue, low blood pressure, brain fog, etc.)

There's discussion therapeutic benefits supplements drugs like quercetin (mast cell inhibitor) famotidine (h2 blocker).

I'm sorry experiencing hope resolves noted global pandemic, starting shot fired northern Italy.
The expert said Italy's long ignorance warnings China lack countermeasures blame, otherwise original virus could brought control.

It seams said China got original outbreak control infected got Italy mutated global pandemic started there. virus originated Italy.  1,000 IU extremely conservative. 5000 IU set safe maximum upper limit daily dosage *everyone.* could easily 2000 IU per day safe.

50K week toxic repeat dosage. Many doctors prescribe 50K make wait bit starting daily regimen. Dry ice forms -78¬∞C standard atmospheric pressure (and cooled that, course energy absorption phase transition). sublimate bit faster flight pressure effective cooling vaccines recommended storage temperature properly insulated device. types shipping, dry ice probably used much easier dealing mobile ultra-cold chillers (especially airplane rides). 

I idea mean 10 hours effectiveness window. vaccines stored many months -70¬∞C, indeed appears likely vaccine stays stable enough standard freezer week (although research going required this.. now, ultra-cold chain maintained dosing point). Oh like Vaccines huh? Name three albums friends eloped courthouse going throw official weddin party later  little maneuver gonna cost us 51 years *HARD AF* Yeah, over. agree. countries stopped outbound international flights upon discovering cases...? trying hold higher standard reason? Well see, high school kids play sportsball, sportsball super important. first gen vaccines reached 90% effectiveness help existing mask social distancing rules. likely make short periods indoor exposure without masks relatively safe. make teaching safer too. 

But end. figure first gen vaccines reduce need social.distancing masks still worn close proximity groups long period time. Say train rides,.buses, air travel, movies. T- 6-7 months nightmare hopefully discussing WeChat group leaked internet December 30. certainly first ones report it. wanted inform families. gained information health bulletin released Wuhan hospitals day. cover-up government allowed release information hospitals. reprimanded leaking public seen inciting panic good reason. turned good move considering turned pandemic century. essentially mischaracterizing happened. actually read articles happened realize I'm saying true. Instead probably read headlines are. freaking nearly December people still taking proper precautions. excuses knowing anymore...we've dealing nine months now. Packing small funeral home opposite happening.

Yes, funerals tragic. loss loved ones always is. ways hold one put everyone risk like this. think normal people vaccine til around 2025. US incompetent especially military, conservatives, there's chance product distributed timely manner. Plus think vaccines actually work. look Oxford. We‚Äôll see. think lot resistance crumble see neighbors getting fine. crumble REALLY fast need prove you‚Äôre vaccinated go sporting event, concert, bar. It'll start affecting only, get vaccine responsible people take it. doctor checking inflammatory markers? I'd curious see remain elevated experiencing chronic symptoms.

Also, seems commonality post covid syndrome mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS). know SARS-COV2 activates mast cells, many symptoms described post covid patients bang MCAS (Fatigue, low blood pressure, brain fog, etc.)

There's discussion therapeutic benefits supplements drugs like quercetin (mast cell inhibitor) famotidine (h2 blocker).

I'm sorry experiencing hope resolves implement herd immunity program? data regarding filtration efficiency common mask materials, actual performance masks varies mostly due fit. make mask wonderful filtration fabric known mankind, air leak around edges limit well protects you. knowledge NIOSH standard test cloth masks, respirators, fitment sealing issue.

Even N95 respirators stop particles, many them. ""95"" means material stop 95% particles 0.3 microns greater, COVID aerosols size smaller. healthcare environments environment may filled COVID aerosols, N95s simply lower exposure. Hospital-type cloth masks catch droplets effective aerosols.

Bottom line - mask one layer protection. Wearing mask helps. Wearing mask everyone else wearing masks helps more. Everybody wearing masks keeping distanced well-ventilated areas even better. watch full video?

It sounds like watch all. Cut open count rings. lower ground viral particles exhale less likely infect adults.

Yeah one EVER catches anything school, ever.  I'm surprised immediately seized feds.

Carbon dating Hopefully whatever damage career ending her. Everyone thinks vaccines mean get back normal.

But vaccines tested conditions people still wore masks socially distanced. means vaccine probably effective scenario. Without precautions immunity might 60-70% effective.

The researchers trying get out. vaccines tested existing pandemic rules. likely masks needed time. I'd say vaccine likely make indoor dining maskless pretty safe. still watch movie theatre. That‚Äôs fine. commenting news article mentioned day. got young kids home won‚Äôt allowed get long according experts lockdown anyway.  Well I'd happy gift kick ass cane December gift holiday.

No one questions government websites coming using IE. never said that. Constantly reading number new cases deaths isn‚Äôt good you. safe, wear mask don‚Äôt need track numbers time.

Caller: is.

Us: deadly virus that's infecting killing folks world. know one that's television.

Caller: television idea talking about.

Us: ""............."" people say ""normal"" think crowded movie theaters Friday night.

Yeah honestly don‚Äôt know we‚Äôll ever go back that. disappointing thing many people probably refer one faulted dataset say ""See, studies wrong! reacting!"" beginning biotech age. cannot close restaurants without guaranteed help arrives close. work 2 restaurants, non chains successful. doors shutter extended time without assistance, close good. Old record 4 years. expectations way mine. Correct. buddy maintaining 50% capacity, despite state saying fully reopened. ...and airline realizes mixup it‚Äôs Manila room temperature.

You're welcome. Gee wonder why, it‚Äôs like (pfizer) 90% work anything That‚Äôs great idea. one missed point friend. Numbers never point comparison. traffic deaths fatality numbers Covid, saying would make sense? 

The point is, cure worse disease. amount people seem think government enforced nationwide lockdown would net positive USA scary. clever, thank you. today spent entire day photo shoot costumes themes, feathery lights life &lt;3 yours' names?

I‚Äôm saying shot UK, really underpay public workers. people military make (or eventually make) good wages lot benefits well. military also lot bigger might see.

We see 800b lose minds us individuals incomprehensible, reality overall it‚Äôs really well spent. Seriously. think people understand situations, even people WANT go another country... People bought gift cards like bonds. pay now, money goes keeping things afloat services rendered future. also allowed bit anonymous charity amongst friends. system put place. 

My doctor friend wears valved 7000 series half face respirator p100 cartridges surgeries/in Covid ward. 

When non covid areas wear duck billed style n95s

I‚Äôm sure similar system put place common areas. full protective ppe fit tested n100 doctors/patients, there‚Äôs still risk. 

The air filtration systems hospitals also pretty good. I‚Äôve even seen portable hepa filters places patient areas reduce additional particles air patient needs take mask nasal swab. much people don‚Äôt believe it, high quality masks quite effective. Someone covid also get multiple uses medical quality mask, don‚Äôt worry cross contamination making sick. They‚Äôre already sick. need make sure, particulate matter gets expelled. 

I assume special entrance hospital staff ppe fit checked even enter hospital. 

If choose, would def sending nurses home sick pay, seems like already don‚Äôt enough nurses trying best awful situation. It‚Äôs obviously opposite side spectrum ideal, it‚Äôs nothing can‚Äôt mitigated extensive precautions.

Got studies evidence back up? goes everything we‚Äôve told sars-cov-2 transmission. Especially number anti-vaxxers. imagine they'd like something substantial actually base fears on? ventilation. proven facts Covid spreading ventilation system buildings? heard actual news misinformed people live claim true. idea. could somebody let know provide links? said Americans take virus mitigation steps order help overwhelmed hospital systems.

Here problem see it: everyone idea ""virus mitigation steps"" are. lot people genuinely confused do, confusing situation. people wear masks, go bars, think take test days travel safe family gathering. Far many well meaning people (I'm talking people ignore virus) going justify family gathering going react shocked pikachu face someone family gets it. Everyone heart wrenching story ""granny going us much longer"" ""I done everything right since March think deserve see family"" really sucks. genuinely heart wrenching situations people in, remove emotion situation gathering all, period. basically Grinch point out. I'm hurt triggered lol I'm reading comments thread. condescending everyone, engaging discussion. bet doesnt even know lunch made fine eating everyday.

The goal necessarily change minds come reddit, spread information. disagreements happen natural compare facts information try find common ground learn *what actually going do*. whole thread discussion. one going change mind read reddit comment.

I think shows disconnected going here. new controversial subject lot people **are** trying form opinions gather information threads. That's unable comprehend conversation feelings hurt

My feelings nothing this, I'm pointing anything say fall deaf ears delivery concern discussion, condescension (poor) sideways insults.

To knowledge, teachers catching COVID rate general public (and quite time even true doctors nurses, least university hospital), implies closing schools probably much effect teachers catching COVID. adds ultimately, statistically, marginal safety benefit teachers closing schools. marginal safety benefit, giving enormous amount educational time kids. Online school simply cutting it. think N95s march on. opinion alternative unthinkable. Realistically we're going close we're at. Australia literally took handbook follow step step. Result: VICTORIA. I‚Äôm rough time already, can‚Äôt imagine would like wasn‚Äôt exercising. walk dog, lift weights days (fortunate enough able build home gym craziness). Reread wrote see contradicted yourself.

And yes evil, they‚Äôre authoritarian government censors manipulates (not always successfully), committing genocide. mean, ignored people made first place. talking family earlier. work nurse fully expect hospital admins get vaccine me. They'll say ""hospital employees"" since admins never even see patients technically hospital employees get right away. work recovery room right fairly low exposure fully expect admins get vaccine even though work exposure basically 0.

""BUT ENTIRELY PFIZER, TELL AMERICANS HAHAHA"" anyone gives fuck. got excited reading comment! hope add metric column corona trackers oh god i‚Äôm chicago paywall. someone post please live Miami Y'all see shit probably handled viral load low due mask. original comment specifying bars still sending kids school would take closing bars kids safe sent school.

So you‚Äôre advocating closing things comment back people go bars needlessly?

They also go eat needlessly go church needlessly well exactly confusion coming from. I‚Äôd say living public health fiat 9 months pretty indefinite. isn‚Äôt first rodeo lockdowns. think mean teachers countries beside America restrictions means politicians going tell us stay home, gatherings people die. go airport, get plane travel place. I‚Äôm sceptical claim Military fed children worldwide arm govt .... guess budget bloated aid funnelled keep increasing it. ¬£800B year grotesque. world turn legend lol What's gotta covid19? Wrong Hand washing almost nothing. Shame mask failed sounds like probably entirely since got mild case. Could provide escort security? 3 weeks indefinite. 
And yes, agree indefinite emergency powers right. Pandemic aside (anyone right moron) lawyer Finance type guy sortof party would seem OK. guess Doctors revered society serious professionals, it‚Äôs unsettling seeing someone that‚Äôs doctor sortof setting. Universities labs entire departments dedicated securing grants funding. time consuming financially taxing. blank check make vaccine removes LOT barriers someone refuses close business, government go fine individual. definace guarantees legal issues person. 

If police start fining protesters, small minority would affected. People may see reason defiant, odds one fined small. matter? damage done already. Capitalism wins. Well also knowledge previous SARS vaccine thst finished (because funds lol) ground won. know specific vaccine benefited tho 1933 address following passage National Industrial Recovery Act, President Franklin D. Roosevelt noted ‚Äúno business depends existence paying less living wages workers right continue ‚Äòbusiness‚Äô mean whole commerce well whole industry; workers mean workers, white collar class well men overalls; living wages mean bare subsistence level‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI mean wages decent living,‚Äù stated. know subject dr fauci? love sub talks ‚Äútrusting experts‚Äù, experts go r/coronavirus groupthink lose shit say experts wrong. It‚Äôs hilarious thats good cos havent many wars Show where? disagreeing personal attack, guilty charged.

-snakehole  saying CCP, authoritarian regime manipulate censor everything, good do, care public image etc.

And know evil? How, may ask? military moves people come
Commercial jets completely suspension bill rights - yes. virus. 12 months runs out, collect 3 months. yeah one dads friends ventilator couple months (ruby princess ) got better released . 6 months later couldnt talk still trouble walking complication caused Thank you. really wonder college apps going look like coming years.

Dont forget trumps input domestos bleach injections arm lucky enough guy briefly dated get groceries last weekend (and checked every day since), planned shop weekend low groceries. Someone else picked pre-planned Thanksgiving dinner, too. Someone else grabbed something needed PetSmart Black Friday, since said would hold item 3 days even paid online already. So, great getting help those, definitely already felt needy asking stuff lol depends entirely situation. Maybe? don‚Äôt know unless see it‚Äôs enforced Maximize to-go order stuff, bar workers manage phone lines, curbside delivery customers instead seeing customers tables better everyone insults even talking about? triggered reddit comment? guy calls blind sheep say I‚Äôm insulting others?

The fact think people come reddit change people‚Äôs mind kinda sad. isn‚Äôt serious. one going change mind read reddit comment. 

Imagine invalidating everything said using ‚Äúinsults‚Äù. unable comprehend conversation feelings hurt ‚òπÔ∏è

But sure. I‚Äôll keep ignoring doctors research. Hahah Depends state? Michigan running December far tell. terms scale, probably Chinese ‚Äúcoronavac‚Äù one saved world. Pfizer won‚Äôt even save America. Maybe NORTH America... That‚Äôs gut reaction seen top scientists virologists said overall, lessening spread lead less overall deaths. I‚Äôm doctor I‚Äôm gonna try add ideas, something saw thrown around circles. China dozen *cities* bigger New Zealand lmao. much easier game small island thousandth tourism middle nowhere.

If wanna play rules house handled coronavirus better nation planet. say things also closed?


If listed places people go throughout day order essential schools would church, dining restaurants, bars.


Fauci dining restaurants, opening bars, supported masks months now.  grocery stores keep masks mandated rule foreseeable future places like business make virtual passport proof vaccination required 

Simple ya go hear that! Good thing strong children, crumble lol How? advise too, except I'll keep kid virtual school risk exposure kids personally know Covid via kids teachers. [and ‚Äúexperts‚Äù said wasn‚Äôt possible  too, day thanksgiving. great.  even send questions ahead time told everyone think answers least 2 them. great.  Feel free steal questions. posted below.

It‚Äôs amazing many folks don‚Äôt realize could dedicated masking distancing practices, without locking even without vaccine, no, ‚ÄúmY fReEdUmBs!‚Äù  Funny describe ‚Äúhumanity‚Äù really includes behavior less half Americans. vaccine short supply perhaps bit list? that. American association pediatrics wants schools stay open well. numerous reasons kids better school. winning website don‚Äôt think anyone cares it‚Äôs made long works.  agree also comes money people work bars stay home. Otherwise, basically forcing people eviction, homelessness, debt. countries locked I'm sure would opinion would way round.

Has likely nothing fact half country can't deal anything else American exceptionalism. americans, would hope frontline medical staff essential workers get first doses. Testing US still clusterfuck, I‚Äôd agree it‚Äôs pretty similar. Well, go estate. Although son got covid survived without permanent issue, survives too, sue money. I'd make tell story wrong world. You‚Äôll must done. think that's necessary worthwhile precaution. long term side effects, likely face one injection. usually takes repeated exposure kind thing. (In case unclear I'm way defending weird, absurd, heartbreaking handling US.) I'm England, allowed go holidays countries like Italy etc? saying is, zero teachers country wrong pandemic? I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs Reddit thinks  used skeptical, looked people totally opposed it, started thinking maybe they're team want on... think it‚Äôs kind messed value bars restaurants schools country. people need access Sbarro. Apart people psychiatric disorders evil, think people well meaning within context. dont understand comparison ebola, im sure corona ends much deadly disruptive world ebola ever was.

Im sure intelligent person, im sure good colleague, good husband, good father good neighbour. sure best intentions.

What dont like borderline arrogant claims, dont think appropriate person holds office state epidemiologist.

Other countries ice could achieve herd immunity one dangerous cross pedestrian dead? don‚Äôt get joke, perfect real life example joke exists. viral particles different particles virus? ask anyone works young children often catch colds, flus, viral infections children work with. idea people think would different. someone high-risk, plan vaccinate? point numbers game take wrong way, I'm monster, oh well. Maybe enough people get sick, get point everyone knows someone winds ventilator, permanent physical mental Disabilities dies, people finally start listening actual doctors advise Dr. Youtube. summer spike mostly places temperature 100+ degrees Fahrenheit (37+ Celsius), forcing people indoors. I've Arizona like that, miserable real winter elsewhere. Hm, professions trapped people exposure 100+ people time long periods, every single day? Teaching fundamentally different professions reason. 

Also, many schools‚Äô funding directly tied student attendance, obvious incentive underreport cases/quarantines funding, school included. Part ‚Äúdata driven‚Äù data quality, I‚Äôm opinion simply clear picture make decisions regard faculty well European countries still equivalent 60-150k US cases per day, lot less testing US. It‚Äôs much control there. Even hand washing almost nothing Covid (and know answer that), still smart practice hand washing rigorously pandemic still get norovirus (which one infectious illnesses are), strep, cold, flu, etc... want stay away doctor's offices, ER, hospitals etc... much possible right numerous reasons. There's way person dumb. know Covid, didnt think ask anyone outside everyone's wearing mask? Even anti mask cities, there's still smart people wear them. person lying you. Although, sadly must admit there's small part thinks, maybe thickheaded removed world. I'm sure know nation's leading infectious disease expert Nearly CoV1 immunity gone within year, insignificant number reinfections two months. indication CoV2 radically different. Yes I've heard too. Storm sounds intense! I'm hurricane fan me, got lots year ahahaha! situation Mexico even worse states. It‚Äôs extremely difficult get tested done hospital, hence high death rate. Everyone appreciates positive attitude world live in. states load Fever reducers pray pass way work. may PTO save days well. companies lose lot money result. Kids lower ground viral particles exhale less likely infect adults. would want bet transmission linked schools rapidly increases older kids get, simply getting taller. see treauxhenderson wedding bar? Guess I'm gonna stuck country hate then. way using anything digital prove anything airline. asbolutely must, use paper, privacy concerns override desire leave country. sure that's opinion, really mathematical statistic. odds exposed twice, 6-8 months apart, tested genome sequenced times? Genuinely, consider odds happening amount population confirmed cases (US) vs population country. math whiz would love hear. 30%? That‚Äôs it?!

I mean, it‚Äôs better nothing but‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs IT?! fuck here? You‚Äôve obviously never waited tables. There‚Äôs lot that, especially dealing people like maintaining warm demeanor. genuinely need help think better everybody. article really refute point. says children 12-17 spread twice rate children 5 11. logic, children (grades 7-12 US?) learning remotely. least, high schools be. last quote article really would suggest given current situation US--with community spread high--we think spread schools thing zero transmission zero risk,‚Äù says Russell. risk infection school low, especially community transmission low, says. None people concerned vaccines tested years.

Why that? probably voted Trump too. Everyone‚Äôs sick this, imagine people followed health directives weren‚Äôt selfish? Maybe would better spot? May be? It‚Äôs certainty. know Pfizer vaccine US, Moderna one? word that's coming? summer next year states don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true. According worldometers, Russia‚Äôs total tests per capita similar U.S. among highest world. I‚Äôm curious trend daily tests time Russia. Based said above, appears Russia‚Äôs daily tests changed much since march key word isn‚Äôt poor rural. It‚Äôs mostly rural citizens think vaccine conspiracy associated bullshit. Good luck Visit linked subreddit risk. may high amount misinformation.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think ‚Äúbetter everybody‚Äù genuinely need help. I‚Äôm crying Honestly think people even year shit really know. live fantasy world. someone tell 61 flu deaths happened year. official cdc website says 24,000. 405k hospitalizations. Like get people wake function society. Oxford's traditional method vax.
I'd rather stick tried true.
I also believe 90%+ claims, so......  Maybe Scott Moe shut fuck criticizing Trudeau shit knows literally nothing about. Agreed  joke?... people contrive this. lady yellow left side article‚Äôs photo needs new travel agent. Still better flying Spirit, guess. died lockdowns place. real question many would died without lockdowns. number smaller number people die lockdown related issues (like sedentary), say lockdowns bad idea. There‚Äôs really maybe here.

Supplement retailers get away supplements regulated, essentially want long one dies. Phoenix fifth largest city US? didn‚Äôt expect that. point nobody truly knows long vaccine last assumed yearly event point. Also point Covid vaccine osn't one shot, two shots spaced week apart. also recommendation people already contracted Covid still get vaccine. 

The flu seasonal thing, Covid seem seasonal. almost hilarious would go even consider infected many people food packaging! know almost year scientific study touch based covid infection, specifically packaging, hardly real worry. 

Now China gone scanned frozen food packaging recent months intensely like country done, found odd bit covid packaging, turn say likely brought here. said way. I‚Äôm atheist thinking creationist might look it. Yes larger could closed borders travel. Nothing said anti American! honest state Country. I'm proud American know better. almost western countries one parent staying home permanently...

We one highest GDP resources. could people stay home paid workers living wage. Nothing wrong wanting majority Americans want paid far share labor. I'd argue okay 60% americans living pay check paycheck Anti American. get it, feel pain.  


My boyfriend's dad heart cath Thursday. Without good visualization heart, could literally die. tested Covid positive rapid test, panicked, tested negative twice PCR, literally cried thanked God. (To own). knows positive right could cost life opportunity comes back around get health back order.  


But he's thankful God feels must worship church person. Every chance gets.  


I just...I can't. know, right?

unbelievable.  Read whole thing, truly hilarious. Unfortunately person posts deleted mods, can't see all. work electronic document management ‚Äî seeing faster shift paper electronic docs year due COVID.

Here recreating Taylor Swift Folklore album cover Goddamn, Fauci must tired shit too. Give props staying calm consistent....kiiinda want see lose temper dumbassery point though tbh. think seeing friends worsening depression anxiety? see people, scared outside distant one another. virus automatically secrete people. bullshit.  liar. CPC warned US early jan: new virus. could known severity? proof accusations????

Top Germany scientist says Covid came Italy Cuomo: Covid came Europe: I'm going add 3rd party conversation. misinterpret. Probably flew coach. o'hare, none. O'hare fucking huge, size small town, completely enclosed chain link fence. 1,464,694 deaths zero, vaccine needs work score little

/s  Balto/Nome Diphtheria Serum Run type shit Ok troll leave school end day, turn colleagues say, ‚Äúsee tomorrow another day Adventures Babysitting!‚Äù It‚Äôs ridiculous. opinions opinions, current medical knowledge pointing opposite direction seems like you‚Äôre unnecessarily pessimistic. 

I take you‚Äôre medical profession? glad live Australia. hope politicians went scientific/medical advice held accountable. worried international travel effected years this. research. read watch say digging :) good point. incredibly stupid considering close vaccine. People can't help make winter absolutely horrendous, even though vaccine close horizon. believe Inside houses one main culprit, plus number ongoing cases transmission family. Agreed. people must insufferable real life. It‚Äôs like hey nice bike! Bike, oh mean piece metal created exploration minorities ??!,? mean, she‚Äôs correct. Everyone staph. aureus bodies, everyone methicillian resistant staph. aureus. awful, wish someone could seen coming. üôÑ UK. Christmas make worse countries tradition exists expect. picking fight saying society need start prioritizing kids little more? Nothing said directed towards individual. said society definitely showed much care kids year. Whether it‚Äôs sending chaotic school year, providing essential working college students stimulus checks, providing resources kids mentally drained due situation, etc. We, society, done anything make sure kids alright would think we‚Äôd care little that‚Äôs next generation control country. don‚Äôt.

Teachers working hard. doesn‚Äôt go unnoticed. They‚Äôre best. negatives current situation format education home life‚Äôs children rather way teachers teaching. Like said children good. Many not. read another post sub teacher usually 10% students failing class. year it‚Äôs 75%. think everyone knows teachers trying best like students are.

There kids don‚Äôt care learn there‚Äôs lot struggling learn. two siblings grade school seen break multiple times ‚ÄúZoom school hard‚Äù. they‚Äôre usually straight students! also mention parents like everyone two work home parents help them. students single family households households two working parents? kids watch siblings classes? children abusive households? everyone picture perfect life environment. could seen effort child parent could actually even bigger situation behind closed doors.

I agree school spring. think rest year needs remote instead trying rush kids half assed reopening towards end school year. school situation next fall still fluid like said need *plan*. saw negatives year plan it‚Äôs significantly affected students teachers. can‚Äôt wait last minute shed light issue. also need message parents adults need get vaccine chances kids going back real school next year increases. priority.

According one studies regarding depression anxiety, social isolation lack routine top reasons numbers age group. factors mentioned definitely extremely important. obvious disruption normal lives too. kids haven‚Äôt normal life since March. social interaction. extracurriculars. person learning. isolated computer day new social interaction young social interactions experiences! 

I‚Äôm pushing schools opened year. state, schools closed whole year far think stay way. I‚Äôd rather push open summer school rather school spring thousands kids regress school year start readjust actually learn classroom setting. government needs start making plans school next fall. shouldn‚Äôt thought get around later. shouldn‚Äôt consideration. needs focus. school like next year, next generation damaged years forever. Teachers unions firefighters unions going mess herd immunity worse anti maskers rate Even alarming 'thousands' dying day along rising cases. /s freaken doughnut. 12-30g/100g magnesium.

Maybe sell protein powder too. Im sure trust government (not American) mandated nutrition facts. seriously trying play micro game micro nutrients. Give break. 

No one needs take magnesium they're eating healthy diet, minus weird deficiency forming I'm sure going tell about. Heck, Big Mac alone 43g per serving.

Why try go sell someone water well. muddying waters clear reason feel superior. Yes, does. Flu well. Lol okay. fact count one hand number people reinfected 7 billion+ person planet probably coincidence then, yeah? Also, realize herd immunity somehow magically didn‚Äôt work virus, vaccine would totally pointless right? vaccines another way achieving herd immunity? Especially healthcare workers... saying since February. believed. Many didn‚Äôt.

Calm down, completely avoidable February. confer prophetic powers all. week see sharp rise cases, seeing thanksgiving 5 days ago... real uptick positive tests results somewhere next week seeing trails behind. fairness Broncos true quarterback years. human virus. Structurally similar viruses cause colds. would completely ignorant insanity suggest human children spread colds. spread colds like glitter. 

So burden proof someone states kids spreading cv19, school masks hand sanitizer stops (slows R&lt;1) spread age range known quite follow basic hygiene, people making extraordinary claim. absence evidence, universal systemic testing done, evidence. Wait, part US that‚Äôs capacity? able transfer nearby hospital? Genuinely asking knew theoretical problem didn‚Äôt realize happening atm. Hey stranger, kindly, fuck yourself.

Thankfully, every one us mild cases.

Let tell this,

You‚Äôre piece human trash. one healthy 28 year old friends died, would statistical anomaly concern me. Doctors ones treating people, nurses are. trying put doctors, think like commanders, nurses soldiers. Nurses extremely overworked right now, sister one, hospital fuuuuuccckkked right burnt out. bold prediction part strikers would going hospitals administration. places healthcare unions far know. ha, ban 3... 2... 1... deaths relatives mean far words stranger. Lemme tell this. wear raincoat rainy day 90% duration, take end still get wet, fool.  wait people get ready Xmas, Xmas itself, New Years. 

Unless people wise up. see uptick guaranteed around end January, mid-February. neighbor primary care PA. parties frequent seeing multiple people every week so. baby, pregnant. we're weird ones stay away neighbors run back forth other's houses guests go. says everyone going get either way

What? vaccine close. I‚Äôd say bc administration tbh it‚Äôs definitely factor sure Yes, place lined first. least respectful common areas, despite different levels comfort risk. may true incremental loss 4-5% labor force... rest? seriously think 4-5% population driving surge? far beyond that, see packed airports? Everyone family lives far away emotionally distant other. separations like rattle nerves everyone else, another, usual round winter holidays one bothers see other. least time around, there's valid excuse we're sticking opposed usual; ""have money travel"" ""car broke down"", ""I'm working"".


The joys disjointed, dysfunctional family distance helped us tear apart. Likely patient described lonely. It‚Äôs literally quote. primary endpoint vaccine trials reduce spread sar-cov-2 (the virus itself); rather, trials purpose prevent limit effects covid (the disease itself). say, ""95% effective,"" means 95% effective reducing disease. vaccinated trial may well become infected (and may even shed virus!), know based available information. know succumb deleterious effects disease. time rental wasn‚Äôt needed, rural hospitals able transport patients nearby hospitals cities. assume people try... find information may prove assholes? ‚Äúhow get here‚Äù question fuck right point.

I feel like people know ‚Äúat point‚Äù...No one wants change? Ok, cases rise.  ? Lol got flu shot 3rd trimester baby would antibodies born. Americans bar shit crazy. 45%. PT treats severely debilitated post-covid19 patients. We've sacrificial lambs get-go. sound burned blame you. Burnout damned common Healthcare professionals. I'd suggest separating taking block time decompress. Somewhere away routine like hiking something. reason CDC wants shorten Isolation time GOP Senators contract virus can‚Äôt make senate vote trumps fed pick! One many reasons! I'd see people post pictures Facebook showing big Thanksgiving get-together. knew stupid friends, confirmed couple days ago. Thank her. Yes is. functions grows like e^e^x similar. I've seen brief instances pandemic curves grown like that. happens people actively spreads virus, care protecting also increase social exposure. think ultimately people want justify behavior they're going regardless deadly virus actually is. I'm glad hear that. good hear human compaction times.

Also, happy cakeday! Ooo energy, nice. anything regular person besides stay home safe help y'all? agree. you‚Äôre actually taking seriously locking down. 

I hate selfish people are. hospital work explicitly tells employees post photos/videos social media patients may sue company invasion patient privacy. Although violate HIPAA policies hospitals. There's central authority assigning gets tests.  leagues pay tests keep games going fulfill lucrative tv contracts.  Hospitals could buy tests wanted.  government could supply them.  Nobody's choosing prioritize athletes. One entity choosing obtain others aren't. United ""Delivering cure worldwide"" reading headline gave surge panic. good. You‚Äôll need amendment. Different fines different people definitionally unconstitutional violation equal protection clause 14th amendment. Well could use fake/troll accounts post info photo one comments hospital's social media pages says putting families danger. One right one, she'd look like idiot others well irritant making look bad social media despite even working there.

That may bit much unless really hate her. could froze mortgage payments problem solved I'm learning much professionalism him. tendency go off, watching work around Republican bullshit really inspiring. Put toxins body ""protect"" something 99.95% survival rate... Sound logic children's immune systems/bodies significantly different adults?

Yes. Even simple matter dosage, would need test there's increased risk side effects small children get full dose. need reduce dose, vaccine efficacy affected. ok guesstimate based adults. anti-vaxxers would field day healthy children minimal risk harm Covid instead seriously harmed rare vaccine reactions. fair, MRSA isolation precautions absolute overkill, even lead worse service admitted patients. 

The last time looked current research 2017, MRSA spread effectively halted strict enforcement hand hygiene patient contact. 

Moreover, forcing staff gown entering room ensures staff go room little possible. Isolation precaution patients receive less attention staff measured badge trackers, in-room encounters also shorter. New medical conditions changes get missed often this.

The focus strict enforcement hand hygiene unit rather isolation PPE. thing. Exponential fine. Good. fine everyone there. people really need news articles like state obvious them? Like shit gonna happen. guess always stupid people know think know hear news read internet. Come think that's people world. even United States. Let's honest global population. lack intelligence tested levels 40's back May. Since take 5000 IU D, 400 mg Magnesium, Quercetin, K, E, 50 mg Zinc, 1000 mg C, Multi Vitamin, Ensure, Pepcid AC, Baby Aspirin Tumeric daily. checked levels since since work 3rd shift congregate care facility experiencing rolling outbreaks, figure can't really Vitamin intake since eat one meal day generally. definitely able find enough reason revoke license. patients get Covid die could probably sue her/the hospital too. might win, there‚Äôs definitely enough sue giving flying fuck.

That's got here. ""Usually"" regular doctors nurses become complete dicks. talk insurance, pharmacy, doctors. Intentionally sending endless loops cost hundreds dollars per month feel like ‚Äúmake example‚Äù right?  [Listen work contact tracer hear people complaining time informed situations contact someone tested positive. That's situation frustrating me. I'm side people constantly upset situations virtually risk spreading virus. sounds like OP upset without even knowing essential details.

Ultimately protected health information someone COVID-19 not. helpful contact tracers able collect information contacts initial case without fear people mad them.  I'm gonna say Thanksgiving. least family, usually get together extended family, whereas Christmas usually immediate. That‚Äôs OP‚Äôs point. Schools open, lockdown removed 27% infections, remaining 73% must coming schools shops. state one pointing failure here. figures exact (mentioning positives unreported), impossible pin one AP.

The article also states new lab, also wonder resource constrained were. many people care immediate gratification convenience lives suffering others.

Its wonder cant get universal healthcare thr US. People dont care others. looking good north texas right now. society fully break care enough people dying make happen. It‚Äôll pass we‚Äôll see cases decline given huge percentage population already COVID slowing spread. vaccine six months late. We‚Äôll natural herd immunity vaccine. option buy n95s, that's treat severely debilitated post-covid19 patients. 

Why it? treat patients get paid so. everyone burnout high. That's nature working healthcare. lot reasons keep schools open. big one quality education. numbers this, anecdotally ten year old little bit ahead curve going year would screwed. 

Yes, dead can't learn anything, get it, reason. think child welfare huge reason live school. legit lose sleep night thinking kids awful situations would able get help before. Add fact many kids rely meals school primary source sustenance, think easy see simple issue. definitely that. Nurses still high demand probably better pay safety measures nurses whole pandemic settles down. close schools too. think knows there‚Äôs way US ever contain virus. kids asymptomatic, sure actually massive part spread COVID-19? understand tight rope walk, making sure kids taken care of, economy keep going. I'm also saying bars shut down. remember school hallways packed 30+ people room sat maybe 20 comfortably. I'm back forth noping living savings working ass making sweet travel covid money. based risk, sort inherent value. Everyone equally worthy receiving vaccine. ones get first greatest risk catching COVID and/or dying it. Let healthcare workers elderly, essential workers, general public. Kids make bit longer. health teachers faculty staff important inconvenience. Six months ok. Teachers front line workers putting risk. /r/skincareaddiction helpful. Ordinary also sale. think lot went hill stopped paying people extra money. Hard give hoot anything gonna lose apartment business etc I‚Äôd fine set 8 weeks government paid everyone income $70,000 last year $1000 dollars week. Otherwise sadly think increase poverty might deadly long term. America saves world one again.

With vaccine flew Belgium.


American exceptionalism again. public, Dr. Varon offered different words: ""America going see darkest days modern American medical history"" nation ""do things right"" coming weeks.‚Äù  

I wish would spoken clear directives like: wear mask, keep distance least 6 feet, wash hands, stay home definitely don‚Äôt feel well listen medical experts become full shit don‚Äôt suggest shutting schools. terrorist want people suffer extreme blind lockdown measures. shut too. goddamn internet. feel skin thing.

Though news coming nurses, one battlefield need constant testing athletes entertainment workers. Renown pushing tests within 24-48 hours. CVS, Walgreens, Wal-Mart pushing tests within 48-72 hours based upon partnerships Quest PWNHealth.

None take pandemic seriously unless get sick, fucking sucks New Yorkers done everything keep fellow New Yorkers getting sick dying. Agreed. Apparently minority area though. like home more. government right tell people can't work can't run business, unless compensate losing. people scared virus, let quarantine 2 years get vaccinated. people scared, let be. opinion piece trying passed study. Mostly anecdotal.
Why 6month old anxiety issues quarantined? That's ridiculus. Babies stay home anyway. manufacturer incredibly fair point. let 13 year olds go school. Generally kids seem better everything Corona related schools open sounds like great idea.

Seriously? stable 400-600 new cases level almost half year Poland. 3 weeks opened schools new cases count skyrocketed. almost reached 30k new official cases weeks ago. nobody knows truth government started fiddling numbers.

Schools source transmission, one worst ones lower chance spotting infection children right away. children contact other, teachers, parents grand parents. I'm surprised Fauci even recommends keeping open always sounded like someone would put safety first. get it, kids next generation comes first-- health perspective. right thing do. pay mistakes? need much regular childhood possible.

Just level quality takes. burning pile nonsense, garbage shit. data, 50% population. F Yeah it'd waste use Antonov's definitely, speaking know military transport. know 55, that's neat, 3 heavys pad, two 747's japanese humanitarian tsunami. recall correctly, discrimination health care basis race, color, national origin illegal.  (Section 1557 Affordable Care Act)  Prioritizing groups medical treatment (vaccination) bases race, color, national origin, certain attributes, would seem prohibited. 

While may make sense so, would likely take amendment law, Federal regulations implement law. process usually takes years work through. New vaccine methods long-term tested safety something want body.
I want crash test dummy Big Pharma.

I'd rather less effective, older type vax, get any. Predicted March April, pilloried. follows regular flu season (which obvious Southern Hemisphere infection trend) way peaks February. long way go. Sounds like food borne illness little faith - federal government consistent potential COVID-19 vaccine provided free. government actually already prepaid millions doses.

I understand skepticism, really isn‚Äôt lot risk - even cynical view, it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs best interest spend federal money vaccinate everyone get economy running again. transportation trucks planes, [dry-ice used.

Essentially, vaccine's stored inside closed container dry-ice, that's sufficient keep necessary low temperature around 10 days.

Since 2 weeks approval, put dry ice containers proper freezer destination wait 2 weeks.

... actually roll clinics hospitals, 10 days dry ice storage plenty quite while, long people lining take asap.  Tipping bullshit system ever. unfair pretty much every metric. Racism, sexism, classism, etc. come play. mention boss give bad schedules totally fuck income.

The entire system predatory. ""We'll pay minimum wage guilt people tipping make difference"". weird comment. Statistically standard living worldwide ever increasing. even really sure meant this.

Life likely continue get better everyone, literally always has. Sad true. Homicidal negligence? essential workers. /r/byebyejob Dr Fauci realize kids school? them? Reported. looking CDC website Live NYC victim inconsistencies. GENIUS plan closing zip codes one leading spreaders. drive 4 blocks everything open orange red zone folks getting nails done blocks away spreading virus them. areas it‚Äôs one side street closed starts next zip code yellow yes open. Confused yet?? According article location didn‚Äôt even liquor license, they‚Äôre arrested charged too. telling there's video C130, rollin strip? *x* number airborne rangers take litte trip, perhaps? said state would revealing ‚Äúwinter plan,‚Äù ‚Äúnext-phase plan,‚Äù keep virus check starting Monday.


Don't need get check keep check? Apparently even mass unemployment combined near-guaranteed respite infection distanced outside enough get Americans walk outdoors. Truly hopeless populace. least sidewalk Fauci moron. Schools terrible ideas open. Whoa. Dangerous misinformation here. ICU's even close 40% headroom. We're much worse shape. Sort ICU got there! XD

I guess could consider posts social experiment sorts. two weeks ago.. Three Fifty thread seems broken. I've replying lot feedback questions appear ending outer space somewhere. want say thank well-wishes, reinforcement, feedback actually know care? Something already happen. covid. right enough sue ass. should. money. make sure take better steps let happen again. helps build comfort level, vaccine isn‚Äôt nearly new quickly developed looks - vaccine platforms worked evaluated safety decade. didn‚Äôt need urgently now, vaccines moved approval process yet - SARS 1 largely went away own, MERS.

Most leading SARS 2 vaccines essentially MERS/SARS 1 vaccines details spike protein swapped out. 

Article leads conclusion HHS data garbage... horrible response whole thing soon going moot point. point, we're going muddle vaccine's get distributed. Seems manufactured Belgium. anyone recovered COVID feeling especially affected cold weather year? It‚Äôs extent symptoms recurring months later, breathing gets worse cold didn‚Äôt used happen Cool. Guess I'm coming home visit... third time!!!! banana cray. better set border check points again. cant keep going without seeing Ma... get first big screen TV, realize better buy Costco super bowl. computers sell really terrible black Friday.

I'm surprised people still go store since cyber Monday thing. Dr. Fauci urges it?

I'm sure he'll right Jan 20, do-nothing current president still 50 days - responsible shit right now. viruses coronavirus coronaviruses viruses. 

HIV negative stigma decade two thought infect gay men (who considered equals). people didn‚Äôt admit it, treatments weren‚Äôt priority bigotry. also attacks immune system makes complex stop. 

About 77M people HIV (37M alive today, 2M new infections year) it‚Äôs considered controlled. again, numbers 10 years people nothing. vaccine isn‚Äôt dire need since condoms blood tests help control spread. 40 years. 

To compare, COVID around 60M year. killed almost many people (1.4M) HIV infected year

And treatments reduce HIV undetectable numbers vaccines works.

SARS (9,000 cases) MERS (2,500 cases date ) didn‚Äôt get vaccine controlled (or eradicated SARS) human infection. 

So HIV, SARS, MERS equal comparisons. COVID much higher need, research focused it. HIV, SARS, MERS don‚Äôt pressing need. 

I‚Äôm saying easy, it‚Äôs uncharted territory huge unknowns. think meant ww1 ‚Äúmy grandparents depression babies‚Äù statement Healthcare workers back TikTok videos? Schools stayed open lockdown, probably shops, bars restaurants

[BBC article really need ask?!?! Dr. Mike, pH.Dick see society breaking down. death toll course continue rise simply pit control spread. see starting around mid December rolling Feb March countless hospital systems US completely fully overwhelmed. New centers used, issues staff, PPE, medicine shortages. Many may fine treatment inevitably treatment.

Because hospitals overwhelmed, health issues normally would treated able get care need, increasing death toll, seen Covid numbers, later road.

This depends individual counties states do. LA SD took steps forward slow things down. others overwhelmed? That‚Äôs unknown, besides Texas Gov said it‚Äôs shutting - matter what.

The cold winter increase spread dramatically. top this, flu picking steam. another issues people flu Covid time - also get flu, need medical attention doctor, able Covid rampant community. This, unfortunately, add death toll, again, seen Covid numbers.

The isn‚Äôt even big problem see. see coming later 2021 health issues stem Covid. lot data shared incurable illnesses POTS depression, anxiety, mental disorders rise Covid many months prior.

There much know long-term problems may face, issues long-haulers face. Yes, concern coming winter, it‚Äôs going pretty, honestly much, much concern comes after. something feel dramatic affects insurance industry, hospitals, untold millions able afford proper care whatever issues facing.

Right 1 5 people Covid develop mental disorder: now. Could end 1 4? 1 3? don‚Äôt know. look case count daily figure least 25% people going need mental help months road recover. Covid waves hit, spring summer, see USA going handle practically nationwide mental health crisis.

The world knew prior virus going return long time. sooner people adapt new reality pay close attention may come 2021 essentially domino effect issues Covid (and haven‚Äôt even talked cars, real estate, stock market, etc), sooner prepared.

It‚Äôs doom gloom. It‚Äôs new reality prepared for. fortunate fir decades. Life easy. Life wasn‚Äôt way tens tens tens thousands years prior. many (and are) revisiting new reality. literally cannot handle mentally due what‚Äôs called ‚Äúmental capacity‚Äù. Look up. It‚Äôs real issue many don‚Äôt wear masks believe happening. 

Anyway, could go hours see going next year two. I‚Äôve followed since January fir many hours day, many weekends putting 18 hours day reading, learning, talking people hell lot smarter me, getting involved things, making contacts, etc.

Why dedicated much time energy? I‚Äôm father. anything everything protect kids well future. I‚Äôm wrong? Shit. I‚Äôll first one go dance streets. That‚Äôs sure.

But went all-in January saw leaked videos China sites on. knew immediately big one. single double it, began prepare.

So that‚Äôs folks. Fingers crossed avoid worst case scenario head full steam ahead winter pretty much everything wide open. Stay safe there. Mask up. real, anyone mirror? someone lives touristy place, annoying it‚Äôll great economy. Silver lining take awhile enough people get vaccine matter of: yearly shot gets updated new strains?, effective various brands?, deal people refuse get vaccinated? Yep me. travel home dorms closed weekend arrested. medical peeps position make lot money. don‚Äôt care they‚Äôre doing. She‚Äôs one them. also produced Puurs, Belgium you‚Äôd want differentiate 10/30% 50/60% position matter time start seeing million cases day‚Ä¶ dark times ahead sure spilling onto streets? Americans actually understand words mean. Thank God stupid people stupid see easily. Truly praise. think we'll get big bump cases 2 ish weeks? understanding Moderna‚Äôs vaccine doesn‚Äôt need cold Pfizer‚Äôs though never going work Gavin knew it. He's sinking ship Trump nation's leader. many people want, much travel state, many ""essential jobs"" lack understanding beginning serious could help either. given Megachurches don‚Äôt follow book teachings doesn‚Äôt shock me. instead?  Lmao kidding actually charge 1.5x regular rates, plus inconvenience improvisation fee. guess participating stampedes part beyond-satire ritual... cannot relate even pandemic NYC much stronger lockdown than, say,Iowa. bit half actually locked went ""Mission Accomplished"" numbers continued spike. rational compromise country.

Also nothing, driving analogy someone continually puts innocent people risk get license revoked. start killing people get charged negligence. May might early still. Realistically we‚Äôre looking probably 2021 get population vaccinated. course, healthcare workers older people get shots earlier I‚Äôm seeing Spring 2021 optimistic timeframe sub 40 age group. Ok lift already happened friends living decent one bedroom Phoenix $450 2007. Built 90s, dishwasher, washer dryer unit, ect.  


At time, paying $1200 4 bedroom house pool LOL false sense security, holiday season. That‚Äôs mass majority health officials experts across world recommending school stay open, kids way worse able go school getting covid. goes healthy people working age. point health experts supporting lockdown anymore, usually suggest Sweden approach. matter? 50k positive cases report number people hospital regardless. Ok thanks much :). Fucking diabolical. I'm sure lot people going continue fellating despite this, preposterous. amazing pandemic put imbalance plain unfairness certain social institutional relationships part everyday life clear focus many, realization workplaces/management care productivity, physical mental well laborers, yet focus carry public education, sphere much still sacred cow despite *intentionally* producing conflicts repressions people currently suffering order normalize ""just part life"" ""what like real world"".

Even dismiss think compelling arguments public ed inherent force good world must engaged costs, cope reality virus much capable killing children families, nobody fully comprehends long term effects contracting virus, even mildest cases. cavalier attitude different conservatives thoroughly (and correctly) lambasted suggesting virus big deal supposedly impacts elderly? Fuck here. Ultimately asking kids die trigonometry, grammar, history (or attempts pass history whatever state live in). Anybody thinks that's justified irredeemable fucking ghoul, me.  want continue believing falsehoods, that's choice try change mind! Hope stay safe. Well, stay safe. Best luck guys. don‚Äôt say? Really? Way many idiots US. be.... foreign volunteer vaccine distributors show local medical professionals taking vaccines. Build trust showing different plant distribution area located across street AZO airfield Kalamazoo Mi. It‚Äôs really small flies commercial connecting flights direct Chicago O‚ÄôHare 45 mins. 

It‚Äôs probably easier charter commercial flights based proximity airport compared bussing Grand Rapids, flying Gerald R. Ford could handle cargo plane. (AZO would definitely able handle cargo plane large size).  Pardon french holy fuck wrong. Herd immunity works 85% population immune otherwise keep damn disease going around population. treated makeshift parking lot hospital, hospital bill less treated regular hospital?
/S dream... us want watch world burn... Except already burning slow-motion. need living will. Honoring Choices one state. Christmas worse thanksgiving. know lot people gave thanksgiving won‚Äôt give Christmas kinda get Fauci saying though. Think house unit. Say 2 kids 2 parents. 2 kids aren‚Äôt going contract virus going out. people really risk parents go work, restaurants, bar. Take bar restaurants unnecessary risks. Assuming workplace follow protocols, risk parents taking virus home giving kids slim. 

But know reality case. comparison ideal Faucis scenario apples oranges real world example right you‚Äôre seeing schools. People following guidelines thus schools another Avenue spread. 

I don‚Äôt think Fauci going crazy like many suggesting. think he‚Äôs talking step whenever get step A, B, C order. I'm ok ""health passport"" things long they're temporary measure COVID becomes non-issue. they're permanent guess I'm never going concert get here? look thumbnail dick nose driver. Pretty much comforts many people facing situation. I'm alone, god sakes wish facing this. Wtf? never said old age begins 50. fucking moron came that.   woman looks obnoxious. would zero confidence safety protocols, patient, would request never works me. could ‚Äòupvote‚Äô again, would.  don‚Äôt think prioritizing vaccines discrimination. Spot on. Articles written appeal fear uncertainty feeding readers fear uncertainty. Journalisms business operates increasingly saturated market scary doom gloom content generates clicks views revenue. Zero way would sent (step) kids school this.

Remember 2-3 weeks Memorial Day gonna rough... 4th July... Labor Day? certain places mean like concert football game large gathering.

Not like grocery store. Honestly, lot people first take put receiving instas, tik toks etc would probably ton good work towards getting general masses ambivalent fence vaccine board taking it. There's lot people rn like, ""I'm pro-vaccine, I'm little nervous came fast. I'd rather others take first."" people taking first rich powerful, might inspire confidence well jealousy everyone else. yet. they‚Äôre reopening schools full-time, 5 days week, class. even ‚Äòhybrid‚Äô model. insane. experts pdf say ""Adolescents transmit virus often adults."" throughout report, indicates school pretty safe young kids get sick spread virus much. teens transmit rates adults. That's great argument in-person elementary school remote secondary school.

Another good quote: ""Early modelling studies suggested closing schools reduced community transmission less social distancing interventions."" closing schools reduce community transmission. reduce transmission much things, reduce community transmission.

Then ""The risk outbreaks \[in schools\] rises community transmission high."" Community transmission US astronomically high. Therefore risk outbreaks schools higher normal. make great case schools first open last close, fact transmission rates fucking insane moment. one gathering anywhere. insane in-person learning transmission rates across US high, psychotically disruptive keep oscillating in-person remote time sufficient number teachers students test positive force school remote. Despite downsides, sensible, non-disruptive approach time remote learning. I'll check covidactnow link I'm phone. want see getting numbers from.


I'm going trust government link sent out. admit fooled loading animation CDC website. misrepresenting issue? I'm trying paint realistic picture. virus. Try less sarcastic might've read links. Bye. happen July, happened schools opened nationwide.

The second surge US started mid June started going August. third surge started October. Maybe schools effect primary cause. California lockdowns intermittently entirety pandemic hasn‚Äôt really helped

The lockdown help, many Californians wearing masks. surprised many people still partying LA (hardest hit county). still understand masks would make big deal. wear public, done simple. thread promising needed thing comments cracking fuck - esp United comments üòÇ Understood. Thanks clarifying! 

Here‚Äôs question: vaccines, expected heard immunity attained vaccination primary means saving lives vulnerable? mean people get infected normally recover. vaccine keep safe others taking genuinely strengthen folks‚Äô immune system make basically invincible? 1- doesn‚Äôt take office January 20th noon. 
2- president doesn‚Äôt power anything force open close states. Trump threatened force things open talk that‚Äôs do. Biden CDC issue different guidelines governors authority state. dont understand community means not. 50-69 cohort .5% though. disingenuously chose cutoff get lowest possible rate, misleading, also pathetic disgusting. sure drown kittens kid? current government bed China, China cut vaccine current government? seem make sense. expand that? Uhhh wanna fact check first part... there‚Äôs one older 76? Time short Boing time Biden power anything hope major focus vaccination. Okay, clear know leg stand on, provide source humor you. see, CFR 60-69 probably ~2.5%. say cutoff 65, say closer 2.2%. divide 2.2% 5 (per lower end CDC estimates unreported cases), get ~0.4% oldest ""non-elderly population"". 20somethings, CFR .2% divided 5 .04%. seems mortality rate 65 .04% 0.4%, likely lower end spectrum.

i wish read wrote 2 3 years sink shame Cool ever flu shot? mention name hospital relatives recently mask discipline lax unless doctor present patients room don't. worse, emts gather hallways many bother either. think US say made? No, also still lots infections closed spaces, like hospitals, prisons, care facilities, refugee housing, etc.; family gatherings far well. Public transport likely also still plays role. Yeah, 'me too'. Great argument. That‚Äôs assuming IFR 0.2%. Serosurveys conducted India (an least three know of) put IFR 0.07% 0.13%. assuming mean 0.1% 1.38 million deaths (population 1.38 billion). one thinking clearly make argument give supportive arguments. banal pylon.

Yeah think over. miss completely? You‚Äôd almost follow Swedish media all. claim conspiracy ‚ÄúEnglish language media‚Äù ‚Äúno internal contacts‚Äù making stuff blue? Everybody‚Äôs get Sweden reason?

I miss articles appears. number discuss government showing heightened role, similar enacted legislation beginning pandemic. Several articles pretty obscure including letter editor local newspaper Ystad news website (news55.se) I've never heard of. think conspiracy english language reporting seen numerous articles slanted inaccurate reporting last 8 months. idea journalists, lacking local context, write biased articles conspiracy theory. also cute many seem believe something denied politician bureaucrat, never existed. almost mechanical belief authorities. There‚Äôs herd immunity-strategy authorities denied it, there‚Äôs rift FHM Government authorities denied it.... 

In post said may well rift without sources within FHM government mostly speculation. That's way connected quality journalism. seriously worried positive vaccine news going create complacency additional surge actually becomes available people. drastic comparison, way predicting happen become infected, even die run risk long hauler deal resulting health issues years come, even asymptomatic mild case it. People need afraid take seriously follow protocols. It‚Äôs absolutely impossible.

You fucking enforce it. That‚Äôs it. clueless conversation turned fearporn splatter-movie What's puzzle?

Mothers routinely pass antibodies lots diseases pregnancy.

We've learned COVID one diseases, mother's antibodies lasted long enough present passed on. see learning, puzzling something unexpected. prudent us approach food handling caution‚Äîwash hands thoroughly removing food package, handle food carefully it‚Äôs cooked, preferably gloves, make sure foods cooked thoroughly, certain inactivate virus.

It's year since first Covid patients.

- still know amounts deposited surfaces like food speaking wiping nose bare hands.
- still know long lasts food sometimes diluted saliva mucus.
- still know handle it, since fresh produce mostly cooked.

If 10^2 TCID50 real-world half-life two three hours, simply leave shelf days.
If 10^6 TCID50 real-world half-life 16 hours, nothing enforced mask mandates hand hygiene prevent infections.

The Chinese observed infections this, know much amount food imports measures. country runs toilet paper thinks distribute highly volatile vaccine couple months. Haha bullshit. Untrainable Crew. 

They learn nothing past. Well mean.... don‚Äôt greatest track record international app. People say whatever want America important education? usa education, told americans, joke anyway. one learn actually land job?

When look education stuff taught, little really mattered terms useful field studied for.

I economic education, business economics, general commercial economics, retailing oriented. papers start business - country actually need certain degree knowledge able so, regarding safety measures, best practices things like liquor license. short, standards...

Now everyone seems worry poor kids gonna miss weeks months education. think nonsense.

It 2020. school still set learning distance, heads fired 10 years ago. 

And know, supposed good kids interact. fine disagree. let's face it, means interacting world today ever grew up...and remember black white tv!

We allowed lower standards increase entitlements. Zoom, twitter, fb, Discord, twitter, SMS, Email, apps galore... even in-game bloody chat- fuck TOS loss privacy, hey, can't - words, many ways staying touch.

And yet afraid become 'lonely'. 'depressed'. meantime parents physically kick kids door climb tree gain dexterity beyond twiddling thumbs gamecontroller, parents actually worry kids breathe open air.

I feel sorry kids. Especially 1st world nations. Close damned schools, safe grandparent. sick, bit fever, won‚Äôt get much shuteye. you‚Äôll sleep like baby night haha big blue link post. Translation/Gist

[The story mRNA: once-dismissed idea became leading technology Covid vaccine That‚Äôs pretty good comparison, maybe bit sicker night after, overall, nothing haven‚Äôt seen vaccine before. One vaccines pretty similar side effects. one really gets business sending covid positive seniors back nursing homes instead keeping hospitals peak time March April.

There's doubt option, really stinks states cities past 6 months options think ridiculous chose route everyone knows sucks. lesser two evils choose there's handful better options Florida places chosen those

People attack Cuomo big numbers New York big state find dozens I've States hundreds cities higher proportional nursing home death result they're bad decisions made even seeing results New York's decisions hope make infamous hope fire hope take licence hope never works health care again. know how? Multiple health experts said vaccine available March/April general public. states college students (in draft distribution plans), like myself, getting vaccine sub groups general public. gonna listen experts people like say anything kill vibe? foolish nurses bad. person racist. intention caring reality called got day case nobody told nurses doctors lately, appreciate hell you. sister newborn fighting lives right due covid-19. current restrictions brother law go visit. see baby cam time energy nurses put make comfortable. thank you, truly. 
My point, think point article, person learning prioeitized. 

In city eat restaurant (albeit restrictions) yet public schools virtual. 

Because people like say kids learn home parents take over. 

But learning happening many kids. Stop pretending expecting 3rd wave already per experts projection? I'm little scared cause I'm thin ice. rings cowbell.

But BSE, vCJD, similar caused prion, virus bacterium, transmission routes different. idea costs, suspect would peanuts compared costs paying community spread COVID-19. Doctors treating less COVID patients nurses, they‚Äôre also getting better PPE nurses. It‚Äôs extremely aggravating doctors walk around like martyrs nurses stretched beyond thin. I‚Äôll listen scientists one. article doesn‚Äôt say anything IFR deaths. don‚Äôt know ‚Äúsum‚Äù talking about. would say mindset turns mentally unstable people, and/or children trauma depression? 

is rhethoric would considerate? mean can't sleep? I'll happily take stead. think people would give shit? Nurses, especially experience, high demand they‚Äôd never turned away. also nurse colleague got COVID twice!!! People think they‚Äôre invincible get it, not. second case MUCH worse, pneumonia almost died. Exactly. called ""experiment."" proven decades ago. Third world countries matter course. ""most advanced"" nation world call experiment. know isn‚Äôt? isn‚Äôt ideal health teachers faculty staff important I'm still getting paid furlough every month since government closed workplace. extended march full year Yo I'm ""America bad"" bandwagon all, giving hard ""America first"" vibes, that's all. newspapers would consider tabloids? Unfortunately don‚Äôt much choice hospitals full. It‚Äôs infuriating hasn‚Äôt additional federal assistance. know someone reinfected twice last summer. 30 severe cases placebo, zero vaccinated Maybe could learn thing two calculating IFR. I've seen recent estimates .69% (don't recall error bands). Also note, IFR changes time infected population sometimes shift younger people partaking riskier activities treatment options improve. Ha bagged eight bodies one night. predication mostly sound far fetched imo. Caaaaaalm, one 18 getting vaccine LONG time. isn‚Äôt going away quickly know working most? Don‚Äôt know don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm speaking public officials literally exact side effects years flu shot. Yep, change lifestyle, everything needs real life possible. case Michigan throughout March-June... things got better us health care workers July, already gotten worse starting November. Sigh, go difference saying ""people need afraid"" ""people need well-informed""

which two sounds like something insane dictator would say?

look im careful minding ones actions protect vulnerable,

[The story mRNA: once-dismissed idea became leading technology Covid vaccine hope never gets job healthcare again. know horror disease bring immunocompromised patients families, purposefully disregard knowledge keep patient safe(r)... that's truly appalling. 

I know someone got fired posting throwing covid party early pandemic. disgusting woman deserves less. Sure thing. fucking company nothing penny stock miraculously found vaccine. Dont trust take. Next, Wtf trump anything? I‚Äôm circlejerking, that‚Äôs best really feel sorry you.

Those ""hearing it"" base entire argument 2-3 badly translated sentences. actually heard idea things working, still shouting bullshit herd immunity strategies Tegnell calling masks useless. shove gullets.   fault Americans willfully ignorant basic health education.

&amp;#x200B;

Sure there's bit self-neglect there, we've also seen people work longer hours away home, energy, time, habits eat properly.

A lot structural - parents working hard many hours, high school cafeteria health well-rounded options, kid moves without learning cook. Dont take Red Death Vaccine, possibly die Red Death. There‚Äôs light end tunnel friends. explicitly said schools entirely remote much US. say possible everywhere. absolutely rural communities technology simply there. many cases, technology could though school funding. example, school district spent tens thousands dollars cleaning supplies, hazmat gear, substitutes, training, etc. I'm sure every school around country similar situation. would far cheaper provide year internet connectivity every student already connection. fact several districts area done that, well spending tens thousands trying make in-person learning work. federal state governments funded programs, could definitely provide internet every household US.

As special needs kids, yeah, completely agree, absolutely kids absolutely cannot deal remote learning. great respect people choose work population, especially pandemic. mom one them. wears three masks, face shield, gloves 8 hours per day help kids. class, ones remote barely anything, parents remember log day. students special needs absolutely fine remote, in-person makes sense many students special needs. rest school district? absurd claim classes need in-person students self-contained classes better in-person. reason treat students regard. 


Then students well online. get it. Online education everyone. I've seen plenty students simply check out. show Zoom meets, turn cameras mics, spend entire time phones playing games. genuinely try best, feel comfortable speaking say understand, teachers less likely notice looks confusion can't see students' faces body language. kids simply need social interaction learn, need able turn peer talk out. horrible situations, living small apartment three four siblings parents trying attend online meetings time, distracting. Online perfect. 

But know worse? Outrageous hospital bills potentially death. school remote September opened in-person October. second week November, many teachers sick quarantine front office literally staff every open position subs. take non-teaching staff members away positions put charge classes. Teachers lost free periods sub other. Administrators subbing. front office workers meltdowns trying keep track out, teaching home (with sub classroom in-person students), pulled normal jobs free periods sub, etc. madness. madness accommodate maybe 15% students person given day, 85% home anyway. regularly subbed classes 2-5 students person 25+ students online. point open situations? everyone risk lives in-person education almost students teachers plan every lesson work online students anyway? kids getting education would get online, exact activities, except benefit seeing humans added risk maybe killing at-risk relatives. went back remote November 16th. So.... Assuming everyone vaccinated...

Preventing 94% severe cases infection 99.5% people survive results survival rate 99.97% versus 99.5% enormous difference. Ah yes. Another outdated stereotype. bother witty make prison colony joke? much misunderstanding statistics comments. swear God people's minds shut completely see enough zeros. Right wasn‚Äôt sure cold meds virus  Thank you! restrictions gone effect least week Thanksgiving. 

I Fauci's job. I'd given weeks ago. tolerate stupid people well. using politicians subset, Republican landslide! government cared health would mandatory vitamin supplementation People lost sense smell due Covid, long take come back? trust it. Flu shot, MMR, sure. problem. one? Absolutely not. agree Dude, it‚Äôs nearly 8am live Australia. You‚Äôre one needs sleep. enough disgusting tea you? Huge numbers people going get one shot go business. could literally brand words ""THE COVID VACCINE WORK GET SECOND SHOT WAIT WEEK"" backwards foreheads saw every time looked mirror like 40% understand instructions. year end could 100 mil Americans got it, recovered recover, put lower list get vaccine antibodies, sounds fair ultimately matter, private healthcare system looking doomed collapse week now. just...get vaccine? Super interesting US one gigantic solid iceberg. article six months old. first wary like many people are, time vaccine available personally think enough people gotten trials far enough past feel comfortable getting without hesitation unless start seeing really bad reactions. possibility helping get us pandemic potentially protect loved ones (who hopefully get vaccine too, though definitely lots skeptics among them; maybe lead example) outweighs relatively small risk serious/long-term adverse effects vaccine. I‚Äôm afraid bad case covid vaccines point. I‚Äôve asymptomatically doesn‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt get again, apparently second time worse. I‚Äôm getting vaccinated. Antibodies measured. mild asymptomatic cases probably get vaccine, yeah. Even temporarily immune might last long enough contribute herd immunity (which whole point vaccine). mean, scientists way back day priests... different ways trying explain existence. aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive. Brilliant news every case vaccine arm severe. Similar Oxford vaccine, stops way people actually getting virus well. Massive news future mRNA. kind crazy 30 severe cases placebo arm small amount cases, Seems awfully high. Yea keep getting frustrated people claim we're purple tier worse rest countries red tier. I'm bay area we're meeting metrics moderate tier averaging 7.2 positive tests per 100,000 people puts us purple widespread tier. would expected. interesting. feels like transparent attempt deflect fact US way worse. So... test effectiveness vaccine words patients?
 
This make sense equipments Omg literally wrote marketing plan exact scenario CoVid even thing. worked 20 years honestly say company always placed profit people run boomers. GM local store live hasn‚Äôt day since March nobody seems upset this.

Glad hear report. Exactly, would think Americans could look data think maybe good idea? what's done done next weeks devastating irreversible. Yeah, 'all bodies beautiful, go girl!' messaging worked well... No. Big pharma kneecaps people charging outrageous prices life saving medication. let thousands millions die every year. ones don‚Äôt likely debt. 

Big pharma isn‚Äôt friend. Yeah companies like microsoft, Cisco, Dell others need step up.
What's say? stadiums do. Corporate sponsorship.
It's really win-win. Students gain better technology, perhaps inspiring pursue technical path, companies get recognized good thing, plus sales Maybe younger population got hit, somehow older folks avoided it. Many fans said scrap season things like happen.

I'm major NFL fan supported cancelling season. Let's hope that's is. Either way, sweat much go places without mask. realistically see things going back 'normal'? saw timeline state late October healthcare/essential workers getting vaccinated month ordinary americans getting vaccine probably around June/July. 

Now we're learning vaccines may approved emergency use late December. 

To shifts timeline couple months right. lot thread saying April/May think that's really optimistic unfortunately. hope proved wrong. Yeah typed decided look. best articles first results page.

Some closest friends work veterinary medicine, reception vet tech (think nurses animals.)¬† person, love animals, want provide pet, you, exceptional care.¬† Unfortunately, several factors stemming pandemic created havoc many practices, particularly vet emergency hospitals, including:


-Many people got new pets since working home lonely.¬† Additionally, people spending time pets due home, means attuned ‚Äúoff‚Äù behaviors, also worried sometimes smaller issues normally wouldn‚Äôt time observe/ deal with. ¬†Also, people home more, animals lot opportunities get things people leave (chocolate weed‚Ä¶so many stories people calling Fido Kitty getting these.)


-Many older vets retired rather practice pandemic.


-Some offices close periodically someone gets Covid deep-clean.


-Most offices allowing people building pets safety staff, instead folks wait cars, sending staff member parking lot get pets. ¬†This means staff member PPE-up, they‚Äôll near people. Needless say, adds LOT burden already often hectic days.¬† vet offices least somewhat understaffed, friends tell me, caring animal, little margin error (which they‚Äôve told worries most: thought messing something up, upsetting someone, hectically busy.)


So please understand, wait, know it‚Äôs fault.¬† One friends, isn‚Äôt exactly rolling dough, works reception area major metro vet hospital, deal angry callers, bringing pets back/forth cars worst, bringing people pet‚Äôs ashes (there always tears, cant even comfort people giving hug normally would.) ¬†She‚Äôs ethical vegetarian never met animal didn‚Äôt love. ¬†She offered time-and-a-half PLUS $100 bonus coming day off.¬† literally one hardest working people I‚Äôve ever met, often worked two jobs‚Ä¶and she‚Äôs still turning mental health suffering bad.¬† Another friend vet tech, almost 20 years experience advanced education field.¬† She‚Äôs considered one best.¬† husband diagnosed covid, she‚Äôs praying test comes back positive get away two weeks without feeling she‚Äôs letting team down.¬† Again, LOVES animals, loves job team, pressure many frantic clients hurting mental health point considering leaving field, would huge loss pets area.




¬† Unless I'm mistaken, people reinfected bad worse. saw something reinfections come earlier year, currently source find is:  virus kills 1 15000 people whatever, hell 30 big enough sample. I'm scientist straight make sense, vaccine kills 1 1000 people, worse disease Canadians Thanksgiving October (and see subsequent spike) yet one cares. read comments Facebook posts parents happy continue bring kids want people ‚Äústop snitching‚Äù. Supposedly 40+ team tournament weekend. BOS making zero efforts contain this. Again, *expected* populated state incredibly dense urban areas would struggle contain outbreak. fact California top 10 sign we're better job states -- necessarily great job, mind you, relatively speaking better expected given density size. put perspective, difference population California #2 state, Texas, roughly population entire state Georgia, 8th overall population, mil #5 state.

The less populous states absolutely blowing us water, yet see happening all. fact, actually opposite. SD, ND, Wyoming, Kansas, etc, faring far worse per capita.

The CDC estimates 53 million infections occurred end September (we caught 1 8 infections testing, marked case tested positive). Gottlieb suggesting beginning October end year, we'll double number infections. family gatherings Christmas big parties New Year's Eve.

Why aim 400000 deaths? definitely get 500000. Let's aim higher!
/S I'm Pfizer trial went morning get blood drawn (1st time since getting second shot). nurse said vaccine FDA approval, they'll contacting people got placebo let know. learn within next weeks. Dunno there's data lag (almost be) not, that's insanely low marginal CFR. Less 0.25%. wave Wisconsin going quite now, easily long enough deaths catch cases. implying big pharma released virus? find interesting - placebo usually vaccine irrelevant virus, get side effects.

I'll take peaceful indifference neighbors actual cannibals.  still keep making false claims based headlines evidence. MFAT charge investigating headlines result investigations covid found coolstores meat Argentina New Zealand meat New Zealand infected. bad reporting bad headline. discussions officials resulted information true look reports days later see different quotes like this:

""Agriculture Minister Damien O'Connor said he'd received update morning MFAT New Zealand meat directly implicated source positive test results.""

Jacinda hasnt gotten involved need. NZ meat banned China. would definetly find headlines New Zealand NZ$3.7B market closed nothing comment articles suggests actually is. currently information NZ meat banned isnt!!!

Without federal aide businesses people state go back lockdown. It‚Äôs simple harsh truth people need accept Blood hands insane selfishness. No, millions Europeans Canadians travel across country ravaged pandemic go eat turkey pie. probably thought would already vaccines approved healthcare workers early month. 

I think timeline shifted right couple months since probably get emergency approval late December apparently. 

June-july timeframe probably right probably year now. 

I'm personally curious people going behave given vaccines require two doses almost month apart. Lol hilariously random comment. Butt hurt much? Fauci said even people who've infected take jab. I'm assuming placebo group offered vaccine two years, would alter data, since would 'protection' placebo group members dropping study. Good you. rather work home.

Now, explain seems affected positives? I'm going try place blame situations like this, except fact hope federal law passed require states accurately report cases major viral infection going forward...every day week. Apparently 20 states hid cases holiday. Why? need pass bunch laws stop people like Trump/Pence/governors/mayors getting involved. Mandatory mask wearing shutdowns challenged. Reporting data bit trickier. I'm talking virus, mind you.

Also, actually support packing courts, courts claiming religion trumps life, maybe time change system support 5 republicans, 5 democrats, known proven non-party. Maybe time limit terms supreme court justices 8 years. Shoot, maybe bar anyone running office older 75% average life expectancy ensure folks touch reality can't run office. like question.

Assuming Christmas, also happens birthday. I‚Äôd sayyy $300 Florida people yet activities always open schools. Trying say classrooms schools nonsensical. 

Plus there's sorts issues schools, mostly testing part shitshow vaccines roll sure. long lockdowns school closures 1918? watching downfall country many people believe science. immedialy approved kids. planes flying anyway, it‚Äôs easier cheaper use can. Even military uses commercial planes lot things, like moving people around. Military cargo planes best things airliners can‚Äôt do, like carry really big cargo (you‚Äôre going fit tank cargo hold airliner), using runways small bad condition (there‚Äôs video going around lately C-130 landing beach), needing ground facilities (you drive vehicle right military transport, crane ramp needed), flying combat zones.

Its fucking breeding ground asymptomatic carriers bring cases back home Yikes... idea would even best course. That's double edged sword. anyone else get irrationally annoyed guy? Dead people don‚Äôt buy drugs later on... fucking stupid? That's means. 30 people placebo group developed severe covid none vaccine group did. 95% won‚Äôt voluntarily take rushed vaccine, hell bet 30% think it‚Äôs democrat ploy take White house consider test subject population demographics.

Is shocking serious infection rate among persons desire ability seek participate vaccine clinical trial fairly low? No. Bedridden patients (en masse) getting this. People disabilities going participate trial. extreme elderly participating (en masse).

This study severe infection rate overall far lower global population severe infection rate.  make guys work morgue free week handle dead bodies  trust ones vaccine? time, last person around 2 weeks ago, hung bit masked.

Thanks posting OP. actual backing. early 21 vaccine distributed. economy wont 2019 levels better 2020. want doom gloom. way worse vaccines fail. started feel sick morning. guess would 3? $44k-$60k depending education experience. good far shocking. hospitals already :/ True. unexpected too.  biggest street fighters know super respectful follow rules. oldest sickest take risks holidays? 

This Thanksgiving, I'm xenophobic, Alien one favorite movies. think child would Hunger Games now. take weekly normal reasons prophylactic Covid. treated Healthcare workers like shit beginning actually protected them... Then, predicament. Bill Gates big pharma teamed kill big chunk population and, turn, harm profits? Seems extreme zero cases. /sarcasm many days contact starting feel sick? parade missed South Dakota float. actually took vacation Black Hills area back February, looks like last long distance vacation awhile. Yes. Executions great solution that. Really showing strong human rights there. catch twice? I'm asking 2 week thing expires December. completely agree medically unethical. I'm wit's end here! idiotic poor quality source doesn‚Äôt belong here. Diet. Blame capitalism want. need get rid capitalism, need educate people schools avoid consistently eating junk food. people make change, garbage brands slowly start die out. Yes, healthy food expensive, that's sacrifice needs made long term health. mean, we're effectively ""I'm kindof ok Eugenics means child house anymore."" like everyone wear seatbelt uncle (or friend uncle) *totally* died seatbelt. I'm starting think maybe uncles exist... I'm reading correctly, used saline solution potential drawback might easier patient distinguish vaccine placebo. Nice. sit anywhere designated, move room freely? definitely felt safe could get it, felt less risk going work grocery shopping. got creative think ok, given feedback comment you‚Äôd think sitting sweat lodge breathing directly other‚Äôs faces ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è going free riders whenever reach herd immunity (whether vaccine or, heaven help us, naturally). 35% believe traditional math, likely. folks placebo arm likely group, actually bad thing all. place surging team covid positive players. live Tarrant routinely see people maskless stores. wear face shield mask worry little less. yeah it‚Äôs fishy survey mean entirely fair, Pfizer Moderna vaccines mRNA them. ""alter DNA"" temporarily reprogram cellular infrastructure. sort cousin truth statements.

That said I'm sure people use cellphones constantly can't explain first thing work either. yet absolutely tracked via cellphones. That's great point -- worth keeping watch on. if, case emergency, reallocated resources testing asymptomatic people treating sick people? Could imagine checks balances though. Whats even crazier feel morphine going in, like injected ice water. wonder works patient watching injection subconscious knows ""feel"" it. less likely get it, likely worse do. whiney pessimist isn‚Äôt going make go away either dont see many states strongly restricting Christmas gatherings. theyll give recommendations zero chance enforced. Sometimes Onion hits really close reality:

- someone works Florida education, tell remote learning seems unlikely. governor adamantly many chose online instruction fall frustrated infrastructure place. worth noting governor cronies also [worked whole experience could sit back say ""Look! told work."" Un-fucking-real. sure voted. Elderly communal living get early, regular retiree work last line. stop billions? Trillions That‚Äôs one way get rid retirees Florida. Look states like North Dakota here. staffing poor rn due poor containment governor given healthcare workers green light return work even COVID positive asymptomatic ""Man, weird people get sick lot new vaccine. People vaccine get sick lot clearly something fishy going on.""

It means vaccine works. particular thing doesnt matter all. different stadium. civilization going freaking morons can't wear mask care others think vaccine developers preying hope people little hope left, l might add wrong predatory! l means chase billion dollar prize l would l'm sure. need vaccine covid nai impossible anyone develop vaccine short order vaccines yet developed 30 years diseases/ viruses deemed equally essential need two lol! I'm scared virus. simple. got life normally possibly could whole time I'm type give fearmongering. really ""hit"" average American apocalyptic near-future looking. 2020 cursed year, gonna best year we'll while. right point everything know covid suggests MOSTLY spreads person closed settings without protection. Think bars indoor dining church. sit people close by. Casual passing someone store shouldn‚Äôt spread enough virus infect lot people unless BUNCH people circulate crowds near people maskless. i‚Äôm saying Id like scientific data that‚Äôs high spreading place. i‚Äôm happy proven wrong everything I‚Äôve read suggests shopping mask social distancing low risk test effectiveness comparing many got sick group. pick easier number, 30 people placebo group catch severe case covid, vaccine group 0 catch it. gives ""100%"" effectiveness rate covid. number perfect since 30 30,000 can't quite compare x whole world's population, gives verifiable stats determine vaccine works well. part based even partially patients word side effects. even doctor's checking patients verifying anything can. Everything else based positive tests vs negative tests severity symptoms. dependent patient reporting kind symptoms following checkups, appointments, etc. definitely uses special equipment thinking of, equipment can't really replicate real world application name side effects effectiveness without human volunteers. I'm Moderna trial confirm tell anything. 

I got program via Craigslist ad. technician guy named Chet. shot van, got super sleepy woke ditch without pants. safe take vaccine later?? canceled Thanksgiving mayor follow rules. Agreed think vaccine manufacturing roadblock. Convincing people take different matter. people want right away. LOT people don‚Äôt want early adopters and/or don‚Äôt financial resources/insurance may needed get it, many people going slow take it. thinking want safe job better start eating box chocolate covered cherries day. sacrifice I'm ready make safety family. see one coming...  I‚Äôm 31 test 95%? 100 people 5 people got covid, social distanced , wore mask went needed school/work, that's terrible result that's higher see workplace thousands 'all right things'. 

Now injected covid, numbers worth positive about. means pay even less normal. right. traveled different holidays. wouldnt expect anything less xenophobic redditor. Yes! role won‚Äôt revealed til vaccine standard.. they‚Äôll need ‚Äúbooster‚Äù ad-hoc mod vaccinated unintended side effects. 

Hahaha make sure praise Mr. Bill Gates vaccine work 3rd world countries. ‚ÄúGreat Reset‚Äù incoming  No.
You said things happened past.
We talking things happening right now.
And right now, Cuomo playing politics even listening scientists. following Europe's failures. Even schools clusterfuck covid infections state refusing test people unless designates areas ""yellow zones"". Then, test ONE bunch kids. heard buddy vaccine give super severe headaches. already take monthly shot prevent headaches, I'll damned take vaccine makes worse.  

Is truth this? nothing political grandstanding county Santa Clara. Fans aren‚Äôt even allowed attend 49ers home games anyway. NFL already established Covid 19 protocols well.

Whoever signed order removed power. people stupid listen selfish right thing. true. could expected level crazy got US? 2016, said, ‚ÄúWell, bad could get? There‚Äôs checks balances.‚Äù wrong. GDI Florida.... That's exactly attitude keeps virus spreading. Wow staff COVID think moving benefits worth get covid working almost guaranteed. Heart disease still kill  might stupid question, didn‚Äôt take vaccine, got Covid, could give vaccine contracted virus would able treat kill virus off? take vaccine hand? somebody explain like I‚Äôm 5 works? They‚Äôre definitely going necessary. 

Damn shame handful states actually put place, some(Florida) already stating intend keep full steam ahead nothing. 

Stay safe. covid non-covid hospitals spring? Getting retired doctors recruited man non-covid hospitals, freeing younger ones covid hospitals would make sense. probably still going try separate covid non-covid patients much possible. might work perfectly still worth shot. New York big lots non-covid patients can't wait well. Why? can‚Äôt work together benefit all? people fucking meltdown it. narcissism ridiculous Source Chinese cities published every single person sick name clusters cases last eight months more. available media pages shared microblog. actually spent time look, could actually see instead putting head sand sound like kids. feel you, required 12 doses id still kicking dr's door get veins *fewer F exemption. I'm appalled behalf individuals field... also selfishly thinking getting new things watch wait out...  I've worked Boston biotech ecosystem long time. Moderna built good science. think Americans realize large portion medical breakthroughs nowadays come Europe also Aussies. They're Big Gov type countries, we're told fail century now; owe $23.3 trillion. ""near"" head line. good luck!

Germany USA really made supply manufacture vaccines. rest world, much, need get line. China can't even produce enough vaccine doses 2021.

Betcha Canada regrets teaming China make vaccines, China pumped dumped Canada, left 'em high dry. Yep super discouraging. sacrifice feels like means nothing chances I‚Äôll infected due peoples negligence  Good question! There‚Äôs four cases experimental group (90 control) there‚Äôs basically way significant stats sample size four. believe read 4 cases expmt group low risk demographics well would certainly expect serious complications. high right now? Fyi, plenty countries tested people returning China first months. Italy example know cases back December recently. might even cases September. comment really address point first detected necessarily came from. Yep. airplane fixed cost, need fly planes regardless due landing rights. Might well make money it. . people wear furs rich, definitely people suffering pandemic.

That's false equivalency. tbf think alot province conservative oil industry. also alot people really truly stupid asf lol  thankful Trump got vaccine quickly! can't, FDA approves it. generally 6 month+ process we're day 9?ish process. course approved faster typical vaccine ""Many years ago""

When? Care give conversations articles political? impossible apolitical talking politics co-signing status quo is...a political statement.

Also vote matter votes affect actual policy affects people's rights. There's huge difference ""angry person twitter"" vs say Trump administration trying go supreme court trying pass laws making ok discriminate based someone's sexuality.

For someone screams politics ruining everything political asia black mirror Ahh you‚Äôre right, vaccine may lessen affects illness prevent getting it? One thing important consider many cases schools contact tracing. lot quarantines means parents mad board mad county ammo shit schools down. Conflicts interest don‚Äôt bear solid data. paywall hope they‚Äôll make exceptions children high risk- like daughter. doesn‚Äôt much immune system. yup, i‚Äôm Calgary rn lol hope 'new normal' rub people. People living healthier lives, cutting carbon footprints, taking care personal hygiene, considerate others ill infectious illnesses, shop local support local business on. 

Employers allow people continue work home, give fair sick pay allowance, understand strain personal loss physical emotional health challenges caused forcing people workplaces jobs could done home. 

Hopefully learn COVID crisis learn new normal. Good riddance, old normal. Sound, logical advice. never hated more.  Depends ask. people think anyone living poverty bourgeoise. I‚Äôve seen generic engineers programmers called bourgeoise, lol

But real problem capitalist class. problem isn‚Äôt much money person (outside deciding much taxes pay), problem
is whether they‚Äôve exchanged labor it, made labor others. No, actually, UK even stronger US. It‚Äôs people like gotten bad. would China blame India? India hardly mind anyone China. news border conflict barely lasted week everyone China forgot it. ""Rules peasants apply Hollywood"" Think this... next ~2 months, vaccinate many people confirmed cases far. hope vaccine rolls super fast. developed Germany produced large Pfizer facility Kalamazoo Mi. fly finished product adjacent airport Chicago. That's funny there's alot vocal people say bad things US politicians incumbents still voted in, what's point again? 2020 going, million-to-one chance isn‚Äôt worth Hah thanks. sure always happens I‚Äôm app. :/ threaten either hide killed think that's OK? fight back pepper-spray anybody who's coming near without mask? all, responsibility protect spray, that's said. Given many 18 asymptomatic, thus taking test, stating ""under 18 less 10% cases"" factual.

Also, 18 asymptomatic easily spread adults. Surges happen July, happened schools opened nationwide.

All reasons keep schools shut. Thanks, yes I‚Äôm quarantining too. 

Wonder got downvoted lol, people weird! Lmao even china release reports still read cuz want to. example, henan province cities many cities reporting cases NAME. Yes published every person description live met sick. wonder willing probably scream privacy anyway like France, implemented lockdown kept schools opened drastically reduced hospital load.
So guess good rule opposite /r/coronavirus think do. Going nine.... living title idiot sister.

""They're you, Vaccine. Weird Al plane."" fact NYC 'potters' field'. cities something similar. speed urgency involved hurrying corpses new. article makes plain. elevated risk Hispanic, Latino, non-Hispanic Black Americans means risk death age 50 equal risk death 65-year-old non-Hispanic white American. 
     risk dying COVID 6.9 times higher Hispanics 40 states recorded 10 deaths among Hispanics.... 
     non-Hispanic Black Americans, already higher risk death causes whites, risk dying COVID 5.5 times higher across 38 states reported 10 deaths among non-Hispanic Black population....  
    Hispanic, Latino, non-Hispanic Black Americans likely die COVID-19 non-Hispanic white Americans age group. findings suggest excess risk may disproportionately affecting individuals cannot work home.... TBH keeping open mind this. Top travel destinations Chinese tourists asian countries like Japan, Thailand, South Korea, Vietnam Singapore. I've always found strange countries' case numbers pretty mild whole time, even government stepped in. Apart cult super spreader incident South Korea, European countries first major outbreak outside China, US India. 

I waiting information gene tracing news early sample analyses. Media propaganda fearmongering want, scientific evidence determines true origins. Wake Moderna gets here. Moderna gang alll way ‚ÄúFrom company saved world‚Äù? That‚Äôs...a bit stretch right there. HOW?!?!?!?!?1/ Tax free shopping 20 minutes Jersey, PA, MD. Lots people come state shop.  Omg amazing :D

What sort things knit?! No, not. Many years ago, people talk politics. managed friends someone years without knowing voted for. lived Europe there. People involved tribal politics. Buying t-shirt politician's name would odd there. 

People's whole personality reloves around politics. people hobbies besides watching CNN/MSNBC/Fox News. 

When can't conversation without mention &lt;x problem. There's problem front. notified shortly virus discovered. human-to-human transmission, research took long took. There's scientific basis China could possibly figured early.  someone working field, oh yes adverse events (AEs) definitely affect approval process. mean major reasons run clinical trials find effectiveness, see AEs pop larger population. 

AEs separated expected unexpected, course attention paid unexpected AEs. There's also severity classification. Regulatory agencies definitely pay close attention section; see past vaccine recalls due unexpected severe AEs kids.

Nevertheless case guess expected AE, especially since vaccine trying elicit immune response anyway. Therefore likely AE added statistic expected AEs final report.

Edit:
There contact information AEs given you, check documentation. documentation also list expected side effects, symptoms among those. Unfortunately, apartment still HVAC running throughout unit.  HVAC system apartment, consider upping MERV rating filter something filter Covid. yet, wait Dec 10th FDA meet order approve emergency use. Exactly they're that's important? Remember Canada partnered China make vaccine, China pulled quid pro quo &amp; refused give Canada focus always prevention treatment too!

Vitamin fast-acting form like Calcifediol used treatment, pioneered [pilot numbers striking. 49 50 treated avoided disease progressing point needing ICU care. deaths. Half control eventually required ICU 2 died.

Regular vitamin processed liver takes way long. treated everyone immediately admission already processed form saw nearly perfect results.  state full people Florida. lucky enough know anyone affected COVID believe this. chances airliner crashing low it‚Äôs even worth worrying about. Millions one. May? Libertarians confused.

I mean, case nothing changed. Voted lmao, funny cuz biden said he's fine appoint Republicans staff agencies, he's weak democrat be, much weaker obama even Hillary. think obama appointed biden VP? bring moderates pro democrat agenda Okay US nuclear powered sublarine get taken out? ...and absolutely none absolves China fucking entire world lying beginning. governments incompetence idiocy absolve CCP fucking world vice versa. Hart use nearly 2 centuries. body goes unclaimed city hospital morgue certain length time gets buried regardless cause death Money. Everyone talk much shit US they'd like there's one undeniable fact US money influence country planet. Oh agree safe. Much likely truck crashes way airport.

On note, let's put one truck, lol. idea downvoted right. guess redditors 16 year old zoomers got politics 3 years ago. US propaganda machine blame politicizing origin virus. initially commented wondering ‚Äúaloud‚Äù specified bars comment. Even people thought taking seriously went home thanksgiving. American healthcare system stress tested like never before. Sending energy Nurses Doctors right now, PTSD endure due selfishness astronomical. opposite, actually. Findings Imperial College study showed 96 people 10,000 infected virus 11 days Nov. 24, 132 previous period. Infections fell 50% northwest north, two regions worst hit. **The so-called R rate fell 0.88 end period, key threshold 1, spread virus accelerates lead exponential growth cases.** Wisconsin good testing, CFR prior massive wave sub-2%. 

Now state surely cannot keep up, overall likely lower multiple undetected cases. issue take everything political.

Take example saying ""I wanna talk politics"" turn talking politics  Sure Yippee! :D real tiny cut...

Yeah that's entire point. Hey, Americans wish socialist medicine... sucks see generalizations time, want say people want better. also recessions depressions kids grow up. Bank England keeps records waaaaay back shows this. kids alright. lot people posturing right now. They‚Äôll follow herd hear friends getting it. important getting young people minorities vaccinated. They‚Äôre big spreaders. Yeah, state saying general availability won‚Äôt summer plans I‚Äôm thinking we‚Äôve got almost year left time everyone‚Äôs vaccinated enough see herd immunity benefit. Assuming immunity somewhat long-lasting, enough people get vaccinated, course. agree sway people, celebrity isn‚Äôt otherwise medically qualified job isn‚Äôt high risk publicly getting vaccine (for celebrity only, kids/families deserve privacy always) requirement first-round. many admired celebrities elderly probably would qualify first round anyway: Dolly Parton, Harrison Ford, Betty White, Willy Nelson come mind. I‚Äôd surprised say 100% (you‚Äôd say can‚Äôt run study everyone (unethical, expensive, logistically impossible). know non-responder, FDA, bristle see 100% (obviously, study isn‚Äôt big enough), claim shot minute see that. EUA territory may weirder story, though.

I regulatory pro, talk things often. meanwhile idiot school district decided go 50% capacity, one subset kids go 2 day/wk go 2, kids school 4 days/wk. 50% working incredibly well too... we've pulled back this. Ironman football. bc it‚Äôs really hard become nurse Yes, positive test qualify make COVID withdrawal, time *requirement* - need suffered adverse financial impact. See pages 4-5: Disgusting, American citizen RN, embarrassment. Hope unpaid, otherwise rewarding stupidity! weakened virus vaccine. poses risk weakened immune systems.

And also might work provide protection immune issues. yes may well safe give also offer protection actual COVID. means still group could massively adversely effected many get vaccine. that's Texas; everything normal outside opting person classes. Football, basketball, playoffs, competition, etc. going.

Same rural OK live. every Saturday 500 people gathered local park street house, sitting shoulder shoulder without masks, watch kids 7 12 play soccer softball.

But none problem schools, problem politics American machismo. I'm Nyc. That's true all. exists everywhere. here, I‚Äôm working little half hours making less third money used (bartending) still get unemployment ‚Äúreduced hours‚Äù. put difference make max unemployment benefit... still less half used make. describe method teaching effective that's whole point, done way, better. Ah, alright. Thanks clearing wish could stay am, parents financial support college they‚Äôre demanding come back home holidays :/ 40 million already it? mean people phase 3 trials mean people already infected covid? former tens thousands. later still receive vaccine even though they‚Äôve covid. mobile website mess, would worked biometrics normal passport totally different document? sounds like made much difficult already. I'm pretty sure SII Serum institute India. article India. mean I'm born everyone know things also born here. Idk things elsewhere Queens hot 97 promoting clubs parties friends hanging playing sports I'm indoors like hermit, people NY. 
Just go Astoria Jackson Heights. Maybe low income areas? Idk towners. area busy since August. People stopped caring already caught could care less. Uh know dozens nurses this. Dozens. Plenty nurses traveling right now, wearing masks, etc. 

Where throw bus?

I screenshots one nurse made claims COVID can‚Äôt hurt eat healthy exercise. refused wear mask. 

This woman like 30% nurses. else new? think wrong. Also, vulnerable people vaccinated hospitalizations go return kind normal. mean... unwittingly provided perfect metaphor make opposite point intended

Nurses doctors. certainly epidemiologists public health experts. Many indeed similar flight attendants airplane - they're flying plane, know lot lingo air travel, know routines procedures, what's going on, take care passengers

They fine job still knowing caring physics behind flight gravity whatever, know contact flight control, fly plane, etc. told stay within lane. 


There's ton nurses anti-vaccine, sorts dumb beliefs, etc. 

It's hard become nurse. know LOT nurses regular people like merlin401 said. think nurses would prefer protected too, actually. deal potentially infected colleagues don‚Äôt take virus seriously. care. someone partied every weekend local bars/nightclubs - that's replaced Insomniac livestreams left house since started.

Sadly can't say people know though. exactly young children? can‚Äôt exactly stay home alone next 6 months. pissed part I've economic hostage told I'm essential risk life I'm *that* essential.

You make sick. clearly respect people still working public capacity. problem people moonlight spreading bullshit, like OP. bothers you, maybe ask upset prospect getting called full shit. Thats risk dying lifetime, every 6 months get reinfected virus know long term immunity forms for. even mean context? *Bortles* need see side effect analysis results people ALREADY contracted covid 19. Vaccine behavior may different host prior immunity. country wants US travelers right lol ‚ÄúnEw NoRmAl! Nooooo you‚Äôre allowed human interaction!! You‚Äôre allowed fun ever again!!! That‚Äôs selfish!!!! together!1!1!1!1

/s Wow japan.. would *think* healthcare workers would know better, stupidity knows limits. uncle dating nurse, (the nurse) convinced uncle covid fake exaggerated cases seen ""just flu"". 

Then went traveled out-of-state big Thanksgiving dinner family got covid. ridiculous. confirm friend Brooklyn got mad phone approving taking second vacation Florida. I'm mistaken, Nurses medically trained beyond tasks need do. learn rest floor. Exactly. read OPs comment checking source. always going journal. Worse Facebook comments know anything government‚Äôs ability handle task large scale, it‚Äôs going fall/winter 2021 general public receives first round vaccination. right. hard know do! call give attention? ignore give platform zero opposition? I've numerous vaccinations never experienced anything like that. sore arm couple days, yellow-fever vaccine gave moderate headache half day. probably defund nurses, there‚Äôs whopping small majority ones behaving poorly. Sounds good me. estimates nonsense. Herd immunity estimates start 60% spread virus high least 85%. ""If send vaccine, I'll review unboxing. Imagine exposure! Oh also hire someone inject me? 100 subscribers thrilled!""   Thanksgiving, Christmas New Years. Spike, Spike, Spike. close actually? hard find information easily. [Insert Eric Andre meme] can‚Äôt leave young children home year. qualify sent home. Even person sits next work tests positive still qualify. plenty medical professionals critical colleagues actively disregarding protocol within hospitals. One infected doctor/nurse could spread many many patients staff.
We 16 people work isolated right one person department travelled caught covid. It‚Äôs huge problem, actually. NYC full people move in/visit state. bring stupidity (it's also much homophobia racism comes diverse city). Buffalo Bills tight end least rest year discovered enlarged heart due post covid syndrome...He 25.... Reopening schools shut indoor dining gyms...both tied cases. slinging insults guy talking something pretty non-controversial good reason factual information? God. problem act high-and-mighty everybody reality ever throw condescending insults people without ever providing anything insightful yourself. micropenis? Really? 12? I'm loss. 
What think means ""identifying candidate""? remember air flow ventilation supplemented HEPA air filtration units get behind this. cry phone tell may exposed? mean sound heartless, expect? one sterilising immunity animal trials, least knowledge. 50% population basically mean ""almost adults"" ? understanding vaccines tested children pregnant women likely allowed vaccinated. I'm sub. outspoken ""experts"" generally interests quite different individual health.  Good sticking decision!! recently bridesmaid (not America somewhere relatively low numbers), uncomfortable going, especially didn‚Äôt know anyone except bridal party. felt like expected expose lot people otherwise wouldn‚Äôt circle. didn‚Äôt guts bail sure enough, one guests ended testing positive fact, well everyone vehicle came in. I‚Äôve tested got negative results, way bride handled brushing saying doubt anyone else test positive, etc. bothered me. Also, convo months prior asking really felt go time response basically she‚Äôs waited long people don‚Äôt want come, don‚Äôt (she huffy said this). agree @AtomMoleculeCell really hard see past now.  would be. countries, done (sometimes without consent) countries, restrictions place prevent live testing. sport always told never claim anything 100% effective claims like scare sound like aimed stock market scientific community. good point. stated ""about 100"".

But still think reason Swedish hospitals get overwhelmed? aren't. almost impossible get tested. thought tiktok banned US odd get upset reiteration fa tual information. What's problem? Micropenis? daddy hit you? US might already get 40 million vaccines year add Biontech/Pfizer. That's 20 million people vaccinated (assuming reserve second dose person instead waiting new supply). Plus another 30-40 million already it. misusing ""extracurricular"" activities.

Quit misunderstanding basic sports could arguably fall outside curriculum, hold true physical education music/performing art classes.

Think really, really hard. glaringly obvious difference public extra curricular sports/arts **events** physical ed performing arts **classes**? visit sub sort controversial lmao. vaccine developed BioNTech, german company, producing europe makes sense . Two coworkers died COVID weekend. great knowing light, hundreds thousands die over. Even New York Times published positive article Sweden titled ""Vilified Early Lax Virus Strategy, Sweden Seems Scourge Controlled."" shocked see it. 

It's op-ed either. Here's article - thankfully there's Whenever I‚Äôm mood good fear porn know come straight here. people need hug. Oh yea forgot hugging banned confirm, nothing permanent. felt great Disaster capitalism, heard it; going while, expected. Smoking done away patients, typically outdoors away non-smokers. That's harming smoker. like drinking - got really bad situation hurts one chose it. 

With mask though, potentially spreading disease may may even effect spreader. could hurting people. Plus, even speaking someone household, front patients dumb idea ot obviously inspire confidence. Last week, one coworkers announced exposed someone tested COVID-19+. Thus taking time day get tested.

He WFH WFH everyone company WFH, wished luck went day.

If thing happened company least - everyone would taking day go get tested. Maybe good chunk company would need quarantine. exposure happened near company critical date? Would company try suppress contact report could still hit target? would miss it. Failure plan planning fail. Lolol man feel soooo bad girl unfortunate enough let touch don‚Äôt know Skene‚Äôs gland does. no, I‚Äôm sure somehow saves semen hidden somewhere long weekends together. God you‚Äôre fucking pathetic

Just like everyone else I‚Äôm allowed opinion.

As long don‚Äôt give company secrets NDA broken.

Anything else want try catch on? get back serving fries? Worth reading managed restaurants, logging 50% labor cost dire trouble...

Labor 30%-35%. Food cost 30%. Overhead (rent, utilities, equipment repairs, marketing etc.) 20%-25%. Ok makes sense. yeah, definitely should‚Äôve careful :/ Well almost made breakfast crying. 
Thank do. going carnage similar experience. wonder I'm one started to.doubt literally everything.  trust leadership. trust people. trust institutions. even trust education anymore, many people acting reckless educations decent jobs. 

It's like whole world operates semi-controlled chaos curtains pulled back. give shit report lol. 

Get help. Everything depends person. I‚Äôm 140 pound person usually gets weird reactions lol. Totally could depend person. dad brother tiny lol

Seen plenty Moderna small fever that‚Äôs too. Keep getting reported. like building ban XP! Great distinction. Yes trump briefed possibly November, 2019 according intelligence officers. even it‚Äôs 90%+ effective trial period, still leaves minority healthy test subjects somewhat vulnerable, it‚Äôs possible effectiveness wane time. anti vaxxers want bear risk consequences I‚Äôm fine that, significant minority rest population may also suffer. Total CARES act funding airlines neighborhood $50 billion.

Since Moderna Pfizer together claimed deliver 60 million doses year.

That puts going rate delivery glass vials like $830 per. I'm waiting airline CEO (the ones crying CNBC get bailout money) announce shipping logistics free vaccines, hold breath. told going cancel Christmas.   Except mayor denver. told that?  
Don't get like contract specifics trial, long wil take place, stuff like that? need sign anything? flu shot vaccine. roughly 250 countries better US, experienced millions traveling Thanksgiving, probably tank abysmal numbers. far tell, Washington left building. don‚Äôt know people insist comparing us worst, shouldn‚Äôt comparing us best, given consequences? Freedom Nanoparticles, 5G, Bill Gates, microchips - part attempt seriously misinformed group try sound like inside knowledge something know nothing about.

Most things even technically viable. Microchips vaccine? C'mon. 

And even viable - large pharmaceutical concerns managing keep everything wraps literally thousands people involved design, manufacture, testing distribution vaccines?

All evades basic logic - again, people emotional, logical. surprised meeting 12/10 unless something changed? slums India average age 20s. even really notice beyond everyone getting somewhat sick time. Applying know across age demographic US gives us 1.1% mortality. India, tiny fraction - poor parts India, far lower still. adds easily recognize much world *doesn't old people* thus people get severely affected, hospitals danger overwhelmed. Lol ERECT MONUMENT? Jesus Christ. know guy didn‚Äôt take seriously caught reckless. sure let‚Äôs celebrate Figures good point. think reality probably vaccine available next couple months anyways, give us slightly time gauge side effects long term. 

Hopefully around time, clarity whether previous exposure would need vaccine, like chicken pox. 

Overall though, think vaccination previously infected person less likely harm. happen fund scientific research more. Every year could get groundbreaking discoveries cures diseases. next time I‚Äôm weeb con, I‚Äôm gonna get fucking obliterated  independent federal agency tasked reviewing privileged data making assessment appropriateness authorize emergency use. Yes, started around time using similar approach, enrolling participants similar locations. Potentially helps determine side effects well. everyone got vaccine later number experienced headaches, well headache pretty common issue have. likely started head aches time co-incidentally? Maybe, maybe not. 

But vaccine group placebo group one placebo group head aches all, number people vaccine group might potentially seeing evidence side effect. Granted over-simplifying things lot really comes numbers paper they're interpreted. distribution 1,700/100,000 implications hospital load catastrophic. 

I really truly hope Teddy R gross anomaly. considering constrained close quarters much coming months (at least northern hemisphere), something pay close attention to. need like tactical vaccine squad shoot people like dart gun. VACCINE DEVELOPERS ZERO LIABILITY

This accurate statement. use true placebo, non active, instead another vaccine? Lmao. ""Excuses"", I'm sorry Americans tolerate able leave houses even walk dogs, sue us. What's Science behind that, way? cases coming outdoor transmission? so, BLM protests cause surge cases? comparative analysis results control branch versus results actually vaccinated branch.

The control population experimental (vaccinated) population selected respects except injection get (the placebo real vaccine).

Across many thousands people groups, observe see happens control group establish baseline spread infection test population. compare results vaccinated group.

If significant numbers people control group get COVID significant numbers vaccinated group not, build statistical probability model effectiveness. could stop scared get life everyone know big pharma sell data public: 2 ways presenting effective vaccine is: relative risc reduction, high percentage, always ask Absolute risc reduction number, cause shocking low!!! easily medically unethical thing ever heard life. don‚Äôt start rationing ace inhibitors diabetes related poor life decisions? don‚Äôt begin rationing lung cancer related chemotherapy COPD breathing treatments smoking choice? know sounds cruel unethical, is, would probably see lawsuits death folks otherwise could saved cared pretty darn quick.

Really glad opinion would laughed medical ethics department. I‚Äôm still placebo effect skeptic personal self. really think depends someone‚Äôs trying convince of. incredibly tune body, notice everything. I‚Äôm also highly averse creating realities don‚Äôt exist simply mind wants to. 

I strongly believe placebo effect thing reason 50% Americans voted Donald Trump think Covid hoax. really free taxpayer money. government 

In Ireland? Pfffft disagree, still first months dealing virus. hope right immunity conferred year more, know issue resolved. 

I worry many people going think positive test confer immunity avoid vaccination end acting host another months. leave window open there's snowstorm outside? twenty degrees outside.  article:

Cmon Rhode Island better. Making nervous neighbor FWIW, I'm parent kid public school, think one important jobs is. allows work, child thrives school loves learn you. deserve much better get.

I wanted know there's least one parent who's side. worst long term side effects historically seen vaccines actually seem caused vaccine observed prevalence rate far anticipated blended average IFR COVID-19.

(Swine Flu vaccine 1976 causing Guillain Barre Syndrome. Caused extra case GBS every 100,000 people got vaccine.) words 1/100,000 versus 1/200 dying COVID. don‚Äôt expect simple. Supposedly vote CDC go first. I‚Äôm guessing Moderna go rural areas Pfizer cities since stricter storage conditions. 

I would think healthcare workers get first along anyone nursing home. start knocking mortality numbers almost immediately. dying covid main side effect thats funny hahah Guess I'm never going restaurant, bar cinema ever 10%? world? say 70% gonna make outlandish comments. Huge chunks population even know first place. Thanks! That‚Äôs helpful know, bit scary.

Hope part majority gets major symptoms! pay $20 hour survey batteries person stuff could right, hospitals non-COVID baseload also must added. getting additional 70K top normal baseload could end much higher 90K. Right got unlucky given placebo since ended dying &amp; could‚Äôve really used real vaccine, have.. it‚Äôs unfortunate you‚Äôre right signed risk would‚Äôve likely died without experiment anyway guy didn‚Äôt give life science vaccine development. life wasn‚Äôt used drug company. contracted Covid naturally vaccinated like essentially everyone else planet. President's fault hate him. 
This Cuomo's fault. failures led this. know someone died car accident. Yet still drive car. Well said plus issue people even hospitalised suffering months lingering symptoms preventing people working living normal lives, doctor's (from I've read far) still worked happening. ü§Æ. Wtf.  Clean yourselves, people. I'll both. 

I really keep hearing mushroom stuff people PTSD, vets, lot others, honestly thought folks want mushrooms legal, which, like make argument too, make stand point serving veterans, front-line allied healthcare workers, give cover folks might conservative, back it. 

I also create consequences back it, folks support mushroom treatments also. hope it‚Äôs exactly March 11th. cool would be? day pandemic declared. W@W! Europe declare everyone essential everyone gets virus day one! progressive, much utopia mostly immune afterwards, though. really debate. stayed home Thanksgiving means nothing since everyone else boyfriend works didn't. know agree disagree haha  Probably availability give vaccine car drive-thru (similar covid testing). Buddy you‚Äôre person works healthcare. Literally every nurse work taking deadly serious since March. Nurses faultless, I‚Äôm saying that. I‚Äôm saying point blame literally millions people completely unconcerned kinda horseshit. majority us damn best entire political party goddamn president discouraging lock downs mask policies, we‚Äôre blame anecdote handful tictok thots.  certainly need wait weeks see test negative.  people testing positive month two later getting sick significant numbers, think would hearing media would bad omen vaccine working long term. Hang homie. light end tunnel getting brighter every passing day.  50% better chance anyone else though It‚Äôs hard enforce president directs 73 million supporters follow rules ‚Äúmuh rights‚Äù reinfection issue. fair septic arthritis made lose use arms, went prostate cancer said memory issues older age. sad remarkable lived 85 well. looping thoughts thing i've experienced sick.. usually happens dehydrated weak stomach bug flu..

That's terrible thought. also lot RV's. sister in-law works research lab performing clinical trials. said take vaccines yet pushed politicians science. friend graduated ivy league college, molecular biology, faculty valedictorian, believes stuff. know gotten people's minds anymore. It‚Äôll really interesting vaccines, it‚Äôll jumping point similar vaccines. 

The cost viral disease research plummeted COVID ton vaccine technologies ha e developed race COVID vaccines. bunch new platforms investigating vaccines too. I‚Äôm sure much research available exactly cold viruses affecting people there‚Äôs basically nothing it. get sick recover day two there‚Äôs point going doctor tell eat soup drink lots water. 

To make cold vaccine, we‚Äôd need identify either protein coronavirus rhinovirus common couple proteins, could target huge percentage colds, also get people tested regularly order know strains common. 

However, even bigger outcome pandemic thousands new ‚ÄúDr. Fauci‚Äôs‚Äù experience planning epidemic response major pain ass regulators politicians going forward. people Bill Gates said would needed prevent pandemic like one fired job. Sorry reply meant post gotta imagine does. 3 different vaccines probably churning many doses can, opposed 1. Plus think J&amp;J others probably looking get approved quickly virus numbers high US placebo group get infected quickly. Look, hate want that‚Äôs reality situation. It‚Äôs hospitals worked covid triage vaccine distribution continue work. one complaining turning away elderly youth hospitals capacity. Healthy food expensive - that‚Äôs bullshit myth made excuse poor eating habits lower income areas absolve basic self responsibility. know obvious answer. first assumption rate certain side effects probably watched. anywhere cholera common could take vaccine test without intentionally infecting anyone? someone explain numbers cleanly reported? know Thanksgiving, seeing days nearly 200,000 cases. things getting better, states testing/reporting? Yeah, recover little problem. interview months later talked bad was. Also wife heart problems participating HCQ trial possible vaccines politically rushed order make current US administration look heroic, reality necessarily safe effective. could make Europeans, caught Trumpism step carefully back. bugs testing. far tell studies excluded people covid. kind makes sense. LOT people idea covid mysterious illness March April testing wasn‚Äôt around. idea going dengue fever situation (at least far I‚Äôve seen yet).  Leave Yeah, daughter got RSV right pandemic hitting US. freaked Covid felt relieved ‚Äújust‚Äù RSV. also handled like champ. later data show RSV worse diagnosis although known factor treatment still somewhat better imo. Again, missing part vaccines, think virus big problem. Wow really sound dumb. still something science. might well never compare anything rely strict apples apples comparisons, because. 

Might well never play sports, one team might injured players, ref calls biased slightly one teams favor. defender slipped bad patch grass deciding score. 

We can‚Äôt perfectly compare US covid deaths Belgium‚Äôs covid death death reporting handled differently, know countries among worst deaths per capita. 

We lot testing, negative test counts total, it‚Äôs really good measure percentage people get test. NFL players‚Äô negative test counts US total, example. Unless vaccine proves deadly, sacrifice anything time. fact, got opportunity possibly protected virus anyone else, many would consider good thing. infect participants. give vaccine people community infection widespread compare many people placebo group vs many people vaccinated group end catching it.

Of course good thing volunteering test make sure effective safe rest us, nobody died result far know. diseases Moderna excluded trial hemophilia, immunosuppressive diseases, anything else requiring steroids immmunoglobin therapy.

Do happen know whether Pfizer excluded groups (I would assume so, would like confirm)? could find information vaccine candidates? thing people run company pay structure much influenced company's financial performance. end sight that. placebo groups necessary determine drug actually works. Here‚Äôs short read Bad news guy‚Äôs,I 5 7 year old got it.my wife LongHaulers February affect children preexisting conditions,it takes couple months.

No, sounds smart. year, skipped every birthday, Easter, Thanksgiving back October, without apology. son's girlfriend flew stay weeks ago, over, without apology. thing. 

For already get it, explanation necessary. don't, explanation do. effectively today‚Äôs flat-earthers

Says man believe mask mandates. Thats 100 million people, thats seems high guys knows way better promise deliver safest approach considering approach ""mysteriously disappearing Easter."" think personally, I'd take Chinese vaccine, Russian one. seems like everyone hitting home runs vaccine, simply difficult virus vaccinate against. Hopefully they'll good correct vaccines filling important void supplying 3rd world market. Brazil India also players. hope document high risk get vaccine earlier. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôre obvious answer that‚Äôs good point hadn‚Äôt thought before. need compare rates infection trial group placebo group, can‚Äôt compare sample size population instead? bet ""Art O.T. Deal"" get us $5, $4. easy Well *all* die natural death every year course, yes, way would lived longer Covid happened. Somewhat true. But, organizations called contract agencies provide staff. Hospitals like costs employees hard lock looks like. anything like predictions vs. reality Sochi Olympics, chances everyone *outside* West going fine guys‚Äô media busy rationalizing much Covid immunity actually bad thing overpriced, underperforming vaccines still somehow, dunno, represent values freedom democracy. Long term cfs/me compassion action, folks. Jesus would do. 

""Fuck them, aged, contributeth nothing, instead giveth unto youth, worth eye Father, Consuming Capitalism praised."" - Book Psychopaths 13:666 Multitasking best.

Zero-tasking. fair every state horrible he's technically wrong Florida near worst. nope.  take every year still get flu.  take small pox vaccine every year? also quite worried first research it. Vaccines typically take 5-10 years, majority time applying re-applying funding. Waiting volunteers, waiting funding etc. Covid vaccine quick unlimited funding willing volunteers. vaccines could quick resources. rushed sense safety compromised, paperwork rushed.

Additionally, main fear human trials gone long enough long term effects. Well 10 year long vaccines, human trials happen end anyway! basically, safety compromised all. current vaccines approved yet, believe looking like be. approved, safe vaccine available us.

Also worth noting, vaccines long term effects. also \*typically\* dangerous effects.

For asking, here's excellent thread twitter explains really well: ‚Äúelderly‚Äù contribute many ways. Lots families rely grand parents childcare. Lots people 65 still working contributing. I‚Äôd really like daughter see older, full time job having, double PhD holding, top field professional, interact. Fauci old af. majority government old af. Look animal agriculture, factory farming. Likely worse things brewing. :( governor thought already peaked 9/22/20.  went lockdown sooner NZ (12th March compared 23rd), fewer confirmed cases (70 compared 102) also stayed lockdown far longer.

China manned border crossings normal times, undoubtedly much better job situation Europe fundamentally different borders non existent huge economic, social, transport, health, education, etc etc interdependence countries. 

I live near Ireland/NI(UK) border literally hundreds border crossings. checked google maps there're 17 crossings along 15km stretch closest me, pretty obvious isolated island (or country without open borders checkpoint infrastructure crossings) helps significantly would inclined modicum sympathy fact AMA hired Richard Nixon's campaign managers (Clem Whitaker Leone Baxter Campaigns, Inc.) invent term ""socialized medicine"" fight Truman's health care plan. pretty obvious rich ran ideas long time ago circling wagons last fifty years. entire country based nothing grabbing everyone else rolls slowly die alone. Maybe people would inclined listen 'experts' lives actually getting better point. stands, 8% Americans meaningful exposure stockmarket, 12% Americans 40 buy anything coming corporate media can't afford homes family that's left shitty retail jobs. Oh, small business got ass-raped. 


Simply stated, America supposed something better. people bottom figured people top themselves, shit stopped mattering real quick. people shit think nothing better finiding ways convience everyone else eat shit, they're incentive anyone fix anything; economics is, all, based soley incentive. lot us waiting country burst open like corpse House episoide long time. Keep pushing humans physical psychogical limits see happens. know anyone advising children go medicine right now? How's going play there's rural hospitals population dealing lifetime physical trauma this? turns out, there's life getting laid getting paid. bad Americans figure late. suppose people going blame Trump going ones claim epidemic suicides lockdowns, despite fact suicides 57% state COVID. Keep passing buck people, I'm sure come back bit ass sooner later. 1. Wear masks years come.



2. Get vaccinated.


Pick one. Give NFL understands peak physical condition 20-somethings near-zero risk anything mild fever. kind job it? I'm lawyer (but stay Holiday Inn last night) would think employee blood test anything drugs probably illegal.  Per capita rates obesity, rural areas even close obese. We'll see imagine several vaccines approved available. single vaccine produced quickly enough. efficacy moderna vs pfizer least close enough matter. USA like late April/May. Definitely summer. 11 people. 

Wow. See five months, dingus. Yeah bad example. millions migrant workers see family back home months years. Live crowded rooms, send income back home. kind sacrifice make family love care them. tell participants whether received placebo real vaccine impact behaviour. Often studies double blind, even person giving know whether received real one completely eliminate chance two groups treated differently. records got what, course, analyse data check someone actually got real vaccine cases medical issue could possibly related. Frontline healthcare worker here, literally room hospital (or city). can't even imagine getting worse. Fauci also history ""playing safe"" people get overly optimistic/impatient, hopefully end April worst-case-scenario. Based post history I'm assuming one assholes Thanksgiving gathering, trying deflect hard onto Black Friday every. single. thread. Oh haha worries! data analyst drive Uber pinch well give sports betting advice. Multitasking best.  add, correlation 50 population underlying conditions heavily correlated. Likely people 50 tend develop underlying conditions higher rates under. 

So it‚Äôs also safe assume they‚Äôd within first couple rounds priority release. Literally every Governor says retarded shit. see cases rising exponentially refuse anything things go shit. time act see growth start increase, reaches disaster levels. Florida literally apart second surge


And learned nothing. Yes, question long immunity lasts interesting one - one play 2021 based whether start seeing reinfections regular amount (outside one-off occurrences someone develop proper immunity first time) live Sutter Co. numbers roof. Today first day back Thanksgiving break already 4 positives (during break reported now) 12 students/staff sent home quarantine. local percentage 66.6%. spouse works district, high risk, worry daily. Nothin area changed- majority doesn‚Äôt wear masks businesses open enforcing regulations. It‚Äôs terrifying. again, tried nothing; ideas. Sounds like ex's mom person unwilling admit you. people like force opinions others ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è gives socially distant squee! I‚Äôve seen there‚Äôs probably not, especially west, I‚Äôve seen professionals speculate may exist. (I realize probably think it‚Äôs 0 least assume it‚Äôs 0 public health)

I also saw thing hospital capacity stuff. time model, sort like airlines passenger capacity. 100% over. (Although probably bad it‚Äôs people‚Äôs lives. Hopefully)

And also see point, even measure that? It‚Äôs always complex % full realize that, member general public, really need see numbers justify restrictions, feel like government needs get better expressing consistent manner. right HHS data basically easy way that.....

Incompetence, conspiracy main problem see look it. actually considering writing senators it. feel like would win win. it‚Äôs horrible, clear data makes justifying lot restrictions palatable. 

**Anyways thanks discussion. come get different mindset, staying communities agree me, wouldn‚Äôt exactly give new information. least gives filtered information. Thanks discussion, time. honestly trying get answers.**

While here, what‚Äôs opinion CSTE document diagnosis COVID-19? seems, broad me, especially cough listed 1 symptom diagnosis. layman I‚Äôm scratching head it‚Äôs fueled narratives head. bar much lower ‚Äúimmunity start kicking in‚Äù. It‚Äôs 60-70% immunity efficacy rate. even 20-30% bring R0 tons selfish mfs running around spreading like bio terrorists

To fair, people always willing sacrifice people's lives freedom. Looking Moderna data far, may change future:

1. vaccine prevent infection. get infected, ideally virus able replicate much cause harm.
2. That's big question, far know data yet. *may* safe assume shorten time contagious, spread may reduced well. Definitely needs checked know.
3. likely. number serious cases drastically reduced vaccinated people. 11 cases vaccinated people mild, sample size small, bad signs there.
4. duration vaccine's effectiveness, certainly.
5. Depends definition mild. 11 people presented symptoms, likely vaccine prevents mild cases well.

You vaccinated disease, shown symptoms, would surprising see systemic damage organs. nothing known sure moment. Jan/Feb going millions vaccinated people questions answered. lives ruined? Healthy people safe Covid, end permanent lung damage. Ironically, forces become sedentary, lifestyle obese people chose themselves. get choose, lose health save care theirs. We'll see...but data far look good...

As now, solution consistent results masks + social distancing avoiding crowds possible - everyone could majority time public spaces we'd probably better position... Also, guys plans place combat this. Every state wants I've heard, nothing really enforced  LMAO, forgot garbage. 

""It's global pandemic supplies running short nationwide. Let waste gowns masks make stupid video dancing coworkers"". Pure arrogance. Ok mean cool, uh

He could close bars? might least something

Florida's gonna florida though guess. Yet problem Trump taking treatment developed using fetal cells abortion (human cells used see worked humans test iteration.). Go figure. put essential oils butt. cure cancer! You‚Äôre clearly lunatic here. 

In seriousness, I‚Äôll first line vaccine idea drew conclusion don‚Äôt approve vaccine said pharmaceutical industry saving world. probably stupid realize fucking stupid comment is. Thank this. friend, another nurse, told first experience happening spring. hard staff, knew even harder family patient. went beyond, everything could provide love human connection, knew important proxy family moment. hard talk cared deeply. said would never forget entire life. 

And first time happened. can‚Äôt imagine y‚Äôall going through, see happen again. I‚Äôm sorry let down. deserve much better shit asked fix. Ah, I'm seeing comment responding ones. meet first time circumstances three days ago, (via car) come house time?

Even so, masks prevented it. sucks. ignoring posted paper says thing, go ridicule that.

No nerve touched, slinging accusations me.

Maybe working facebook twitter trained well lie, alas, morality truth people like malleable basically researchers trying cure cancer prevent otherwise fatal diseases quick buck?

I already answered different comment, good people get lost system, pharma/chemical business inherently rotten. know, involved it. example, sending spokespeople doctors wine dine them, give money, etc prescribe drugs patients, mhmmmm shady all. Given CDC says, likely well past that. good news would gone down. go largest public high school Ohio started going person August issues date would love holiday dinner you, nephew. compelling counter-argument. And? Well Newson dumb hypocritical shit people might less inclined listen. Biggest news 100% prevention serious covid illness. That's big deal. Yes. 84% chance given case severe, spinning wheel 11 times row getting ""not severe"" time .84+.84+.84...=.15

Plus 16% based small sample size well, probably want use global severity rate segment demographics. local Catholic Churches here, limited seating inside cathedral counted done. Lots distancing inside, singing all, Communion highly unusual sense go separately, wear mask, sanitize hands, receive, sanitize again, mask, sit down, next person. 

Sorry loss mate. Unfortunately, ""flu disappeared"" talking point people think COVID ""overreported.""  supply manufacturing probably biggest bottleneck. vaccines approved means faster rollout. sure first part, see second part hold up.

If simply want support ""vaccinate f u"" system, surely still take vaccine simply refuse provide proof asked it?  Definitely agreed! COVID spreading rapidly terrible, least silver lining faster vaccine. Here's hoping next year things return slightly closer normal. trial results reviewed FDA equivalent agencies countries eventually published public review. Phase 3 trial 30,000 participants pretty expensive. independent groups going that. fun believe, unfun thing understand fat actually MAKES dumber. way around. Well, two-part plan. first part stay. Second part: home. We'll definitely hurting time finally get Really puts craziness 2020 perspective recount time US President told people drink bleach hoax virus. smallpox vaccine 95% effective. measles vaccine 97% effective.  necessarily hate people vaccinate, hate ignorant selfish people fault 2 often people. 2022. *Cancer patient* Florida seems leveled California surging lately. look last 7 days Florida 35.1 cases per 100,000 California 35. That's basically wash. California may delayed inevitable also good chance going catch them.  Moderna Pfizer vaccines only?  article states 5 reinfections worldwide, 2 worse. So, based super small data size seems like it‚Äôs toss up. guess, thankfully, haven‚Äôt enough reinfections really know sure. would kill virus completely country

I live US. went ""real lockdown"" we're experiencing major second wave like European countries. yet, still fat, also lost 45 lbs year and...am still fat, signs loose skin yet. Sure appointment?  Things I‚Äôve seen read told  Yea hospitals nothing numbers. many beds available?

Beds somewhat irrelevant. always take large warehouse convert makeshift field hospital. 

It's personnel that's constraint, specifically trained handling respiratory issues critical care. that's harder one enumerate. accusation, sure true not. accusation stole IP skipped lot trials Moderna others get first. got one those, think smallpox. people tell losing much weight still like 250 lbs 300 safe get vaccine indeed get real vaccine placebo already? Idk got real one want safe. signed trial save lives hopefully get vaccine asap well. bartender giga high risk. Healthcare workers top priority Tomorrow first normal reporting day since last Wednesday. We'll get better picture then. Ew, no. Something fitting  Yeah stated another comment went digging turned advocate participants. reason come thought original article said something like ""told continue normal lives"" must seriously misinterpreted line going back precovid normal. still maintain sacrifice. guy died others stats new vaccine. Seems almost dismissive act like NBD guy died. definitely opinion fact either. thou? two people vaccine one becomes available?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

...heh? Yep. Simply wanted point even historic vaccines long term side effects (acquired narcolepsy one recent swine flu vaccines), occurred prevalence rate present estimated global population IFR. I‚Äôve seeing year. Cuyahoga county people wear mask shopping. dad lives Wayne, good luck finding someone Mask unless waiting restaurant don‚Äôt think will, 20 relatively young need take inhaler quite often (at least everyday) spent lot childhood ventilator, feel like vaccines probably go older CA half deaths per 1M, less 1k deaths total, \~33% less cases per 1M Florida. Seems faring much numbers IIRC, need target number infected determine effective vaccine is. 

Numbers totally made up, ballpark. Say 30,000 people (15k vaccinated, 15k placebo) part study. 161 people get covid, look many vaccine many placebo. say x% effective relative high certainty. 

Purposely exposing candidates covid unethical. it‚Äôs take shot would done. Let nature it‚Äôs thing.

Coincidentally, huge uptick cases November allowed candidates get sick quicker get magical 161 number. 

The months trials estimate long take 161 30k people get sick. good news is, approval today would based one page press release investors. That's good science public health policy. Let experts review data. Good call.  know. many redditors binary view issues consider nuance. said attending 8 person Thanksgiving gathering many safeguards place (we're medical field) told many tantamount murder possibly genocide. Russia's vaccine came months Moderna one, impossible Russia hacked network stole IP vaccine Moderna and/or companies... many beds available? I‚Äôm wondering (not if) ration care.  I'm baffled too. way people think ok thermometer office require temp checks getting grocery store? shopping mall? No, we're insane. We're keen copy China we're practical things. mean true vaccines involved turning gene expression. deep workings genes control life cell.

But true mRNA temporarily takes control ribosomes express particular protein.

I think making sure notion ""temporary"" ""disposable"" used. change permanent. thing (hopefully ) permanent immune system response. Even though prediction, still got flu shot. free insurance not. even risk getting flu all, especially symptoms looked Covid-19 quarrantining tests prove otherwise. hell thinks flu something cool get anyway. wants fever, chills, feeling like crap days?

Plus I'm people wearing masks, washing sanitizing hands more. take cases slowly working way finds pocket least resistance.   Let preface saying telling lose weight.

In order BMI gotten 31, period time eating calories burning (by living exercising). goal gain weight, sedentary, poor diet goal, likely, combination two.

If goal right lose weight, weight going down, (again) sedentary, poor diet goal, likely, combination two.

If goal right maintain weight, doing, necessarily sedentary diet necessarily poor.  original thought, plan now, maybe get vaccine. guardian, new york time... newspapers confirm bias.  I‚Äôm showing weigh-in like think furniture cabinets, look like surplus filing cabinets.  GBS also tends develop within weeks, years later. also higher chance developing GBS flu vaccine.  Ummm...I'm sure that's accurate actually. point think vaccines high efficacy rate. I'm expert, work lab study communicable disease. trial size small. study peer reviewed yet. explanation rate high, make total sense (in different article read, article.) I'm virologist epidemiologist, looking clarity layman's terms. That's ask. fevers fatigue like day half. also lived Ebola panic.  told mask up, tied cloth around faces ASAP.  didn‚Äôt cloth, tied chunks cardboard twine.

(That is: response vaccine intuitively falls range, rather ""all nothing""). Ah makes sense! Thank ""Drafted"" bit strong term implies retired healthcare workers choice/right refuse. 

In speaking retired mentor recently, said hospital ever asked come back terrible mismanagement decades practice, words something along lines ""haha f**k off"" *Elon Musk enters chat* Vaccine work historically hasn‚Äôt sexy. worst diseases modern human life handled vaccines, got back burnered.

It‚Äôs expensive, it‚Äôs risky business, etc.

This result massive influxes money loads accommodations regulators getting COVID vaccine produced.

Academics share lot data, etc. It‚Äôs unsurprising vaccines target proteins interdict extremely similar results.

It‚Äôs also unsurprising AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine significantly different results (though half full dose regime might approach mRNA vaccines), it‚Äôs quite different two mRNA vaccines we‚Äôve seen early reports on.  reason rapid test cannot afford wait results PCR.
This mining company works 24/7.
And agree bullshit without proper scientific evidence.
Their response ""we cannot take risks since know much virus yet"" Many countries seatbelt speed limit signs, people still get killed car accidents. mean driving safe stop dying, reduces chances. 

Wearing mask preventative measure slow virus spread reduce viral load, reduces chances dying, doesn‚Äôt eliminate it. particularly weird people seem concerned hypothetical side effects vaccine real known effects actually catching virus. compromised health death boyfriend would far worse ""negative change lifestyle."" Number one! Number one! Wait what‚Äôs that... never mind, nothing see correct; thinking Oxford vaccines. hadn‚Äôt even heard Moderna results. exciting! good point accessibility vs. effectiveness issue. Rinse repeat article next month Pretty wild managed considering vegetative state botched heart surgery earlier year. Damn, that's news since really see personally. Whenever hear people talk TJ admittedly awesome selection frozen foods (which also main reason go -- shrimp gyoza staple home). Putting together prepackaged everything reduces need customers think they're getting always assumed making play younger crowd (who general would probably like weird flyers well). It‚Äôs also eligibility criteria front least get pool participants could reasonably expected come contact Covid. Somebody works home never goes anywhere would unlikely eligible trial. 6 weeks real lockdown (only barest essential work, limited teams max 6 contact teams) would kill virus completely country. get reopen.

But no, need think harm 6 weeks even though total less have. mean - much hate home state governor - European countries recently locked everything *but* schools they've dramatically decreased infection rates. Talking family UK (with siblings still school), actually seem fairly reasonable approach there.

I genuinely thought keeping schools open disaster making data coming Europe time undermines position. caveat though Europeans extremely harsh lockdowns massive fines whereas De Santis implement that, it'll difficult compare keeping schools open two Florida mitigation efforts. Oh sure medical issues cause problems, rare. One see doctor really sure losing weight despite eating less calories.

Also super high metabolism really thing. People eat junk thin probably eating anything around eat one bad meal day. exercise like crazy take drugs something. I've stopped going get iron infusions saw medical assistant infusion center hospital hallway talking four hospital staff members, chin masked.

My doc offered home health, seem safer. I'm holding long can. that's case, 5 10 times less deadly entire country much closer herd immunity. happen sooner Nothing physically destructive. I've able sleep whenever feel like it, I've consistently hydrated (and drink almost water herbal tea), seasonal allergies manageable they've years, I've monitoring diet taking supplements discipline ever before. 

It's psychologically destructive duration. one blame long thing drawn out. anything, people like victimized everyone refuses take Covid seriously put ""needs"" ahead health safety everyone else. Forced vaccination thing (at least US) surprised ends required travel, school, work, large gatherings. Good know don‚Äôt see someone else household getting infected anything sheer luck. person contagious day two showing symptoms, would take people voluntarily isolating themself household clue infected. lot fewer idiots USA. Somebody paying attention help aunt uncle, seem deny virus big problem, currently taking vacation Cancun ""Instead traveling, cunnilingus home."" Good luck justifying fair sick pay everybody already working home lol wise person said: freedom ends freedom begins.

Obviously, shared housing setting like nursing home student dorm, that's really hard balance, Swedish judge decided freedom spread deadly disease weighs higher freedom protected spread deadly disease. board gas dumbasses idiotic behavior. 7 day old account. take person seriously. 1-2 weeks government gonna open everything economy even though numbers low be. People go pubs gyms aaaaand third wave

That's randomly assign people either placebo vaccine. almost 200 cases placebo arm 6% total treatment arm. assumption people groups social distancing wearing masks roughly evenly, close 200 people treatment arm exposed infected. 

It's theoretically possible cautious people randomly assigned treatment arm, that's wait hundreds cases. cautious person (and less cautious person) coin flip treatment placebo arm. flip coin comes heads once, that's perfectly normal. flip coin comes heads 200 times row, that's rare even consider possibility studying results trial. make arrogant owners financially liable every person gets sick Covid. tunnel full homeless people BioNTech identified candidates immediately partnered Pfizer.

One day‚Ä¶ know, can't know, can't care. Since test blind (the people trial know given vaccine placebo) assume groups behave \*the same\*. That's step 1. 

Next can't know exposed virus. run trial sure have: run fixed number infections, example 150.

Since assumed beginning people groups behave same, assume risk. null hypothesis ""the vaccine nothing"" hypothesis, half sick people would placebo group half would vaccine group.

Then finally unblind trial see many actually sick placebo group vs vaccine group. vaccine effective sick people placebo group.

Now: obviously sure vaccine group self isolate. That's point statistics. saying ""how unlucky would observe extreme result people sick placebo group almost one vaccine group? much fluke would half people determined self-isolate turned everyone got vaccine randomly decided that?"". level unluck basically so-called ""p-value"" statistical trial. Basically p=""what odds we'd observe chance""? p=0.01 means saw (almost sick people placebo) would actually happen chance repeated whole trial 100 times useless vaccine. excellent article, full empathy.

""Pandemic Fatigue"" caused happen lot places curbside pickup too. Guess want business Many districts classrooms switched remote learning in-person learning back virus conditions shift students staff quarantined.

The [new likely mean fewer quarantine-related disruptions in-person learning. schools taking certain precautions, following seating charts, screening symptoms, requiring masks, practice targeted quarantining.

Under targeted quarantine, people within 6 feet sick person 15 minutes wearing masks, within 12 feet unmasked, must quarantine home.

In line [guidance federal Centers Disease Control 15 minutes cumulative. example, two 10-minute exposures would count 20 minutes exposure. make good point, honestly lot public schools teaching stuff like basic personal finance. 

When 18 bought first car absolutely idea good bad interest rate loan really worked, research myself. people agree monthly payment afford even barely afford getting screwed interest. Yes, news makes angry. Obviously, doctors care economy. That's expected arguable. doctors seem care important thing: Vaccinating many people quickly possible. filter slow things down.

I also disagree targeting elderly first, *do* agree providing nursing homes early, vaccinate dozens, including staff, quickly population might susceptible rapid spread.

But obesity? question whether people personal control obesity. question whether strategy would facilitate distribution.

They prioritize schools military. Maybe prisons nursing homes. * Healthcare workers get first dibs, take longer expected suddenly we're going find whole bunch CEOs Executives sorts money ""moonlighting"" ""healthcare workers""

Honestly, even hundreds thousands manage that, delay overall roll-out much.

&amp;#x200B;

* vaccines rolling vulnerable population next, true distribution infrastructure tested. vaccines require ridiculous refrigeration limited, manageable ambient shelf life (something like 24-48 hours, depending one is). Aside challenges refrigeration, many people going given vaccines fall outside shelf life? effective vaccine going be?

Very few; greater risk doses get thrown away they're used roll-out takes longer. Moreover, -70 storage difficult sounds ‚Äî means dry ice.

&amp;#x200B;

* Speaking shelf life refrigeration, many doses going get ruined mishandling?

Again, reason distribution complex done right, professionals.

&amp;#x200B;

* vaccines require 2 doses, dose takes weeks effectively work. many people go second dose?

This real risk. Hopefully, degree protection first dose effective enough stem pandemic, even means booster line. Hopefully risk compliant, either due lose, visit doctor often, already senior care.

&amp;#x200B;

* many people assume moment they're pricked means they're safe?

In older population, there's much do. younger population, either get lucky get immunity infection. said, likely least temporary protection first dose, they're guaranteed wrong (just dumb). Either way, long-term problem show second dose roughly time.

&amp;#x200B;

* Antivaxxers

At least people young healthy. Hopefully, lot end giving means can't go back work school, can't travel internationally, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

* Simple lack access either due location, confusion paying (people learned already testing unconditionally free - true vaccines)?

Another real challenge, we'll suck see. sounds delightful. vaccine projects aimed mucousal immunity, would give effective sterilizing immunity. them. saw quite last week actually. Reno using parking lot COVID patients already. sure! seems select cities shots ready hours/a day depending time approval. vaccine distribution going fun watch, watching military logistics play real time (in non-war scenario).

That's do. can't change others' behaviors actions, respond them. **DARTH VADER DEAD** trump country..what expect!!!??!! Okay, know that. constant supply new vaccines coming using ""expire"" state decide likely 94% people survive virus though? know reason logical, can't used shit vaccines reason vaccine work little person would survive virus bigger picture.

Vaccine approval, manufacturing, transportation, stock, time takes immunity spread throughout population etc. Many hurdles overcome this. 

I personally mentally prepared accept next year could well write well. Perhaps pessimistic, I'd rather mindset getting hopes crushed. 

Hopefully I'm wrong :) Ask whether race profit, race saving humanity know everything need know. look evidance sides right left middle.

Oh mean look news stories, left, right, middle? involved topic concerning political-leaning bias? search evidence then? provides it?  Consider lot people get vaccine may already virus didn‚Äôt know it. virus know vaccinated people return

Depends. know vaccinated people infectious? think vaccine trials looking symptoms Moderna Biontech regular PCR tests. 

And 30-40% refuse vaccination, hospitals still feel pressure. One drug could somewhat unsafe Regeneron, similar antibody drugs. reason people basically allergic antibodies. (That's Regeneron given steroids.) Different people naturally produce slightly different antibodies. Regeneron cocktail couple different antibodies seen highly effective, mean work everyone.

You need vaccine readily generate antibodies, among things.

Please stop spreading disinformation. dangerous. read another article morning review hearing scheduled December 17th. Hopefully preparing roll immediately approval like Pzifer planning. Yea articles seem explained often, people read headlines. good. yeah american company would right that's probably something case. either way hopefully production high enough everyone getting quickly. moderna vaccine supposed better anyways, pfizer's needs special storage like -70c open container times per day, people worried spoilage early on. moderna's supposed able stored like normal vaccine. believe Oxford also said one got severe COVID vaccine either.. really great news. Bill gates yay! trying formulate vaccines viruses, many failed candidates effective ones.

This still case.

The Oxford vaccine based potential vaccine MERS, went bunch failed attempts years past.

With mRNA vaccines, years years failed candidates. general method mRNA vaccine going highly similar virus virus (the hard part getting process work), failed attempts helped Moderna Pfizer. think ever really end them. *prefer* lifestyle. Wow. really bad math. There's also New Year's Eve. Plenty people going sitting around family friends. 

My guess lot people going get infected Christmas may show symptoms come December 31st. takes one person gatherings spread others. I'd really want think could make covid-19 deniers finally acknowledge disease something serious.

 knowing ‚Äùvirus hoax‚Äù people always try minimalize something that's big deal, matter what. hell even deny real first place. 

I'd seriously doubt anything else could make wake cognitive dissonance now. Yes exactly, that‚Äôs told. long they‚Äôve stored transported -80, we‚Äôd 6 days arrival pharmacy use up, imagine difficult. discussion Thanksgiving. black Friday.

There plenty discussions black Friday shit show. think tested times. someone would asked whole conversation chain started would said, yes, tested times. everyone losing minds anecdotal stories. I'm trying share experience here. There's lot goes this. 

I also heard reporting immune response COVID based, part, amount virus initially exposed to. initial viral exposure means robust response leads better protection longer. would mean there's lot variability when/if get reinfected. went yesterday NY limiting number shoppers. fools eager take rushed ""vaccine""... quarantining next year know I‚Äôm one thinks dumb shit second, maybe somebody wondered thing never came proper conclusion think commonly cited explanation weather got cool enough people gather outdoors, areas like Florida Arizona saw less transmission. know indoor transmission far likely outdoor transmission. Globally, cases rise whenever climate make hard gather outdoors, fall temperatures become mild. course factors too. Sure, vaccines. encourage people get infected virus test vaccines. Messenger RNA (mRNA) like temporary message tells cells‚Äô ribosomes produce specific protein. ribosomes exist do, frequently told make different proteins mRNA messages body. mRNA tiny bubbles fat (lipid nanoparticles) that‚Äôs really delivered, body‚Äôs cells take there. 

mRNA also stable breaks within hours days‚Äîthat‚Äôs molecules encased lipid nanoparticles stored cold temps. 

TLDR: mRNA vaccine delivers message breaks down‚Äîat point DNA tampered with. lot gargling going Czech university Yeah that's live. feel like Jew prewar Germany. think lot people realize specialized COVID care is, really ICU doctors/nurses even trained handle they're short supply. 


People assume assign ER nurses/docs cover surge cousin who's working COVID ward ICU nurse since march told ""As capable ER nurses would fucking clue COVID patient"". 


When ICUs full can't send COVID patients ER like us assume. mine closed short while, 6 month cleaning normal time.. one allowed sit around waiting room everyone masks bother even saying then, ""you monkey""? 30%?  


Wow, seems optimistic. Thanks, makes feel better it.  old fashioned way, uphill snow ways bit late considering significantly contributed politicization covid beginning. I'm New York, point stands.

Most government officials trickle truthing us death, saying ""want"" hear today changing later...but that's got elected first place, eject leopard get hungry? Healthcare workers going get thing December. articles always bring sinophobic right-aligned people badly *want* everyone believe Wuhan possible origin 
/or virus exists kind convoluted coverup.

Wuhan origin possible. Hubei region origin even likely. conspiracy cover neither reasonable possibility makes sense aligns information available anywhere world. I‚Äôve already slowly stocking canned goods again. Buy 2 packs hamburger instead one, sort thing. winter setting really want limit grocery store visits much possible long term side effects? problem haha. really semantics tbh.

Nobody really thinks stuff 100% even worked subjects/samples. 

Vaccines almost (I say almost dont know EVERY vaccine) less 100% efficacious even trial subjects. makes useless anything, obviously, helps explain standard vaccines bit different.

Assays, example, often required hit 100% clinical positives used study.  I‚Äôm NYC indoor construction site. 
I overheard guy say 25 people house Thanksgiving. Person talking said ‚Äòguess you‚Äôre listening governor‚Äô. 
He replied, ‚ÄòI usually 40 people‚Äô
So it, people dummies.  family made decision officially cancel Christmas celebration year (hopefully rescheduled spring). lot fairly emotional discussion, kids going upset, absolutely right call.  So, immune system booster, get Vitamin C supplements winter, instead drinking orange juice? would piss badly. EMPIRE TOLD US THREAT!!! hope feeling better naturally-acquired immunity now. actually need around 60-70% people take immunity starts kicking in.

Which still lot, nearly bad. Literally one saying Wow, that‚Äôs crazy 

You can‚Äôt really include patrol boats amphib craft warship since they‚Äôre ships, that‚Äôs nuts Fuck US govt right? lol. Says everyone regarding virus problem demanding US govt get rid student loans handle healthcare claims. LOL. take away anything said, man... much researcher team would incredible, live conscience.

Keeping protocol means maybe couple people control group die might lived. Breaking protocol might save peoples lives, would also compromise data, delaying determination efficacy safety vaccine, thus potentially killing 10's thousands otherwise could received vaccine earlier. 

There absolutely moral weight researches consciences. ""They right thing. Dr. Rand Paul, shouldnt doctor. Advocating herd immunity advocating death. Same, rural areas many normalize obesity disgusting. can't walk anywhere let alone across street give shit won‚Äôt let research shared... There's long term studies ""vaccine"" enjoy guinea pig! believe Moderna Pfizer trials tested everyone continuously throughout trial. tested showed symptoms, really know answer question. could eliminated symptoms still carrying virus. may completely mixed testing throughout trial, I'm going memory.

While outside realm possibility, almost guaranteed bullshit. Verifiable deaths result reaction vaccine hovers somewhere [between 1 2 deaths per 1 million people year die complications vaccine. Consider that, consider share deaths coronavirus 65+ age group 80%, roughly 216,000 deaths. math pretty clear.

It's equivalent wearing seatbelt heard someone got trapped one crash died. wearing seatbelt resulted thousands unnecessary deaths per year, good luck finding many cases someone dying wore one. anyone comfortable taking rushed vaccine? Plus tell ingredients... I'm injecting poison body... I'd rather take chance Covid That's fine, expect people to. That's listen experts matter conjure weird arguments using obscure spot calculations. Question anybody knows: I‚Äôm Astra Zeneca study meet worry study dis Saturday getting second shot. told vaccine isn‚Äôt immunity it‚Äôs keeping people getting severe case COVID19. true Pfizer Modena vaccines too? wasn‚Äôt community state Texas made decision removed hospital spokesman, tents located behind hospital taken Thanksgiving weekend moved state officials ""another assignment."" That's crazy..., know risk? e.g. obesity/diabetes? What's argument vaccinating high-risk groups only?

I mean f\*cked anyway, nothing lose taking vaccine. probably account major part mortalities (I guessing here).

Could decrease overall mortality flu's? great news stock prices got got get it, put me. federal ban backs renters traditional leases well. People already edge homelessness- people living hotels, couch surfing, roommates, hand-shake agreements protected all.

One-third children three-thirds celebrities, athletes, politicians apparently. 1.4 million people nursing homes/care homes. definitely get vaccinated, overall incredibly small portion even first wave vaccinations. also 15 million healthcare workers US, similarly going get vaccinated (and reduce spread LOT). leaves 60% remaining vaccines remainder population. lot discussion whether go old (who lot time left anyways) service workers (who spread virus huge amounts). entire discussion done yet necessarily. Apparently kind meeting decide CDC soon, know then. Personally think likely spread virus first, well younger people auto immune disorders category makes vulnerable. offence elderly, feels almost silly giving 90+ year old aunts going die day either way. even think would accept it.

Hopefully they'll vaccinate fronline workers first think they're going based age. I'm sorry pain. hope doctor help you. course lol.. country gluttonous right. Somewhere around 10-20% cases severe. That's ""rare"" ""outlier"". Sounds like giving people choice. think people attitude seem bit sociopathic. enormous spectrum symptoms label. Maybe did. Masks reduce spread. don‚Äôt eliminate it. requires cooperation, mask would protect others would protect others. everyone cooperated, would significant reduction transmission. 

Plus, it‚Äôs enough wear mask. doesn‚Äôt work unless it‚Äôs actually covering one‚Äôs nose mouth. surely sources that, comparing us literally seizing countries bought paid PPE? stop

What hell last 4 years done people want toss corruption laws window? Every Physician working trial must upfront 25,000-50,000 dollars invested fashion could conflict interest. possible perception reviews made conflict. think 50 million dollars stake big deal. vaccine works mean research standards go window. Hell, view, even need FDA? where? mandated live. Placebo effect real though, entirely possible someone got saline experience placebo symptoms make think got vaccine instead. yesterday morning.  read entire paragraph something? literally said know first statement isn‚Äôt exactly valid. attempted explain guess monkeys recognize thoughts ideas reads exactly like own. don‚Äôt understand Trump doesn‚Äôt issue EO releasing vaccine TODAY. contract Covid another source? humans emotional, irrational creatures. 

If randomized groups differently, one may lived, may one person die. 

Like realistically nothing could/should done differently

It fault feel irrational guilt someone's death. 

If feel **brief** pang empathy person died family, get small sense regret including experimental group rather control group, probably schedule psych eval.

That‚Äôs works Maine poor, rural state Governor Mills done great job listening CDC director. last weeks exploded everyone Maine one best states terms case numbers, believe we're still better everyone besides Vermont Hawaii (per capita).

It worries concerns falling closed ears. idea express issue people way sound like chicken little. whole world going direction I'd agree, case talking US something stupid alone. would actually happen following:

- would increased demand foreign labor, government would relax immigration law meet it.
- would foreign investors sweeping buy cheap property (they already buy expensive property, one reasons West Coast expensive).
- American wages would stay low, economy would tanked short term, layoffs would followed every company responded way expect - slimming keep profit margins (and stock value) up. let get right, denver qb gets coronavirus meeting qbs wear masks forced denver play without delay. happened Saturday force play Sunday. 

Baltimore coach knowingly go facility symptoms, wear mask, use tracking app. Close 20 people covid dont force ravens play Thursday even Sunday give 5 days get act together. 

What hell NFL playing favorites? I'm pats fan hate Steelers absolutely hypocritical put broncos let ravens slide. know expect nfl especially pats fan amazing keep one upping themselves. Yep.

The real phase III rollout. Breaking protocol how? someone is, vaccine won‚Äôt help. It‚Äôs like researchers cure back pocket &amp; holding science. 

Obviously, guy would caught Covid regardless trial. one ever know many trial would caught didn‚Äôt. know people 50 still considered people shouldn‚Äôt issue potential death sentence cause old you‚Äôre not. disease effected children 12 higher rate age brackets would care it? cause doesn‚Äôt affect would still feel same? would imagine data sets get larger, would move little lower, still fantastic. No, Republican Governor revoked. think drastically overestimating pull cdc has. It‚Äôs government conspiracy.

Shit, gov actively neutering cdc whole time Europe, though? 

Honest question. refuse believe even positive test, every symptom book stuck icu. never kind; never rewind. cutoff 25 years old? mean maybe someone anxiety disorder smoke?

Agreed, BMI useful population studies, ie shows developed world gotten lot fatter since 1960s. 

But developed two hundred years ago, anything resembling calculator computer uses square (2) exponent whereas 3-dimension theory use cube (3). But!! probably perfectly scaled 3 dimensions grow height, use exponent 2 3. course back day calculators something like 68 2.5th power royal pain ass. 

And that's accounting height, let alone accounting fact people much variable rates muscle mass days.

Yo let‚Äôs name guy died! COVID death #1,45,996,482! It‚Äôs group effort! Interesting! Thanks. agree conclusion. public trust vaccine quite important. thinking sorta wall names patients passed trials name science medicine. ~1 every 3 ppl? month's time? ü§îüò¨ keep mind mostly pseudoscience: Yes thinking it‚Äôs 3 weeks first vaccines could roll encouraging. Michigan better record, would pausing team activities. 

There‚Äôs really incentive bad team continue playing season. Existing antibodies interact process vaccine originally induces immune response. mRNA vaccine causing cells create fragments spike protein, risk overreaction existing antibodies toward cells. result, many Asian countries performed amazingly well Europe Americas severely damaged

U.S.and A: hold beer

(Sadly I'm saying US citizen unfortunately) There‚Äôs absolutely much goes it, really large problem many angles. 
 
 
As pointed out, lifestyles play huge role.
 
 
Under surface though, American culture, advertising, proliferation sugar vs. ‚Äòlow-fat‚Äù USDAs recommendations based industry vs what‚Äôs actually healthy.
 
 
Reading nutrition labels, start realize absolutely nothing comes box good you. There‚Äôs misconception eating healthy requires spending money eating organic, absolutely isn‚Äôt case. require diligent cooking meal prepping though, time that? Fast food meals boxes easy. Everybody wants easy. data safety vaccine candidates released? I‚Äôm 95% efficacy, safety issue need know millions inoculated. 

I‚Äôm much favor vaccines (can‚Äôt believe feel compelled write that) kids date teens. 

But last thing need fodder anti-vaxers, least injuries might result. cashier interacts 30 seniors every shift. 

If senior interacts say three people per day, makes sense prioritize vaccinations anyone interacts three seniors per day. means retirement home workers/residents, outside world means healthcare workers retail employees. 

We minimize death severe illness minimizing spread, vaccinating based vulnerable. want reopen schools 7th ? stop comparing flu covid! covid-deniers whats wrong thhis world! Adorable little trojan horses. know giving away free. Meaning paying twice.

Double dipping, finances chips dip, cool. mean talking basically two classes people needing prioritized

1) Super spreaders, people likely contract spread virus widely. first foremost healthcare workers (since potentially spread widely double whammy spreading also likely vulnerable) teachers essential front-line workers like food service grocery store workers (who probably spreading vulnerable, degree separation, widely spreading it).

2) vulnerable who, beyond personal risk, also clog hospital beds consume medical resources.

If stacked like pyramid probably go Healthcare Workers (via work place), vulnerable (via primary care physician healthcare facility one), frontline workers (probably school personal first states running distribution run distribution workplace teachers, plus tremendous pressure keep schools open). 

Once gotten that, kind open first-come-first serve basis order kind irrelevant past groups. There‚Äôs way observe long term effects.

There's nothing anyone could change would make possible. fine anti-vaxers taking vaccine family, coworkers friends believe science get ours. know....*both* get plaque?? unfortunately RIGHT people vaccinate antimaskers antivaxxers, likely dwell conspiracies rather get vaccine certainly seems like proposed inverse correlation current MMR II vaccine severity covid-19 symptoms may merit. 

From absolutely unscientific anecdotal evidence, people I‚Äôve known ‚Äúbad‚Äù cases covid ones haven‚Äôt remained current immunizations throughout adult lives. need see backed scientific data people shop aren‚Äôt black friday crowding near people ten minutes Hahahaha. Honest question - *last*? I‚Äôm white collar professional work home. Lebron James, nature job, interacts many people daily. also older me, get vaccine him? Ironic nurse's TikTok username ""Loveiskind05"" College football even playing now. Good riddance. definitely kills. Fookin paywall ... took time year get shit together lose weight get. Agreed, love products, even Covid felt claustrophobic go stores often.

I would 100% order online pickup TJ‚Äôs ever offered it. Lord grateful many reasons job since 2009 WFH. miss interactions, all. Yeah im looking comrade... nearly guarentee safety truly isolate next 4 winter months.

Bring reddit covid downvote propaganda brigade... IL- one near first store limit require masks, least week state mandated masks stores. also limit numbers, someone cleaning carts baskets monitoring line. 

I‚Äôm surprised disappointed find it‚Äôs company wide, fully intend keep going one near since it‚Äôs really trying safe customers employees (they extra precautions checkouts too). Define ""sometimes"". Every day, try read list people died state Covid, ages/location/dod. honor number. ones make really sad spent last month long life hospital, dying apart family. Thank sharing this, still heartbreaking little bit less so.  Yes same. Sleep chair like I'm waiting Harry Potter book release. Rewarding obesity , fan Hydroxychloroquine went FDA... 

Again, someone read article. shocking.

Agreed. see someone walking riding bike assume he/she got DUI lost license. I'm 50 can't recognize people went school know somewhere. knock wood put COVID 19 lbs, also quit smoking lockdown. type thing makes suspect vaccine might even effective stated.

Who talking enslavement? read involuntary military draft, recruitment campaign. Sorry late reply! part time job grocery delivery driver. sustainable get sick easily makes scary go grocery stores strangers' houses main part job. can! test group functionally identical trial all: get vaccine. die you‚Äôre dead forever. Im special Ed teacher 50 cases first month opening. 1/3 teachers US want quit forced working unsafe environments. [Here‚Äôs nurses US don‚Äôt believe COVID precautions. 

I know sounded like trying belittle take away experience effort keeping people safe, asking rethink position nurses taking COVID seriously. nurse stupid enough display views social media, many hold views smarter present it? I'll email FDA state government let know! Haha! ??? Texas state-wide mask order right Nah company want name vaccine marketing brownie points. Yeah would rather get placebo nothing all, currently have.  Thanks this, needed good explanation people know seem nervous it. thing that's sad healthcare workers seeing opposite many hospitals hemorrhaged money elective surgeries/procedures suspended multiple weeks time throughout pandemic. staff usually suffers brunt financial losses. competitor hospital actually furloughed nurses back April. hospital (just suspended unnecessary OT) thankful that. Crazy times. Yea, I'd clump Healthcare workers environmental services/housekeeping. license certification direct exposure patients germs.

But hell know. work FDA anything, lowly nurse think blindpost people thinking cloth mask protect them. there's superspreader mix. Sure, government persuading people get vaccine?  ever believe, blame china rather lack safety. excellent news! hope everyone equal access vaccine soon! good man favorite color blue? Mine right now.

This country going take decades recover. possibly million preventable deaths occur. could contained months ago.

I'm glaring spot East Coast anything.

Nope. problem housed anything. Exercise literally available thing. Everyone jumping jacks, push-ups, set ups hundreds calorie burning exercises bedroom. real science death rate 10 year olds .002%, .01% 25 year olds, .4% 55 year olds ~15% 85 year olds. 

yet act like absolute catastrophe. media hadn‚Äôt blown proportion, would fine. want Assuming go bar late April/May would mean it‚Äôs 13-14 months since last so. Kind weird thought wonder it‚Äôs going odd first means found case walmart 5-14 days later bunch cases went walmart showed Yea, called cocaine. interesting specifically report many cases symptomatic well

Lmao, interesting. idiots stopped reporting actual positive cases back June order prevent getting blacklisted countries, could attract tourism. hospitalised &amp; symptomatic numbers disclosed months. warned times, tourism season realized able secure vaccines inaccurate numbers, revert back full disclosure. Thanks, Homer. Harvard: [But recent studies raise concerns children could capable spreading again: [Children‚Äôs role spread virus bigger thought - Study found extremely high levels SARS-CoV-2 children's fact checked: [Kids Getting COVID-19 School Spreading try, nice lie.

Now go back cave disinformation. not! Thanks! good cocoa powder, too. üëç worked auto finance before. Everyone loses .. including banks. sell auction don‚Äôt get money would made loan paid. Repossession last resort usually happens 3 payments behind. Banks like repo cars. actually 59% said vaccinate according last french poll.

And honestly, almost one know want (even know work healthcare). live drive cross country back several years ago. way back stopped busy diner Arkansas. place packed people morbidly obese 2 friends. credible public health expert said young kids can't spread, said appear significantly less likely spread based available evidence.

And go outright twisting fauci said. actually said ""It‚Äôs shown children 10 19 transmit virus adults **as well as** adults can."" corollary kids younger 10 cannot spread virus, obviously *less likely* so. Completely disingenuous suggestion part given exactly article cited (and SK study mentioned) actually claimed, article notes: recently published study South Korea indicated although kids age 9 less likely adults transmit virus families, teenagers least likely transmit disease adults.

Betsy DeVos public health expert, Trump crony, sure hell saying anything says given heed. even know one year. watch it. SoDak going suffer lot winter. return school Brookings know whether school completely online next semester not. contributing conversation? It‚Äôs seriously tired annoying circle jerk, important authorities trying figure vaccinate hundreds millions Americans. Redditors would rather talk four hundred billionaires priority hundreds millions others. Bringing old people help virus kills old people.... someone thought (or ran numbers said, ""fuck 'em... save lives lose own, net win"") Ha 7 days!! I'm use indefinitely ""visibly soiled"" seems really safe... glad work procedural area, heart goes floor ICU nurses right now... Jesus... US Health Secretary's job speculate Europe approve vaccines I‚Äôm mobile whatever reason phone won‚Äôt load link, headline mean Moderna asking emergency clearance get vaccine sooner April timeline? Many us carrying vaccination cards folded inside passports years ago. countries required proof vaccination certain diseases entry. It‚Äôs long time since carried mine isn‚Äôt new concept. 

I‚Äôm sure loads people talk privacy surveillance bunch conspiracy crap it‚Äôs around forever. wrong? We're parents lmao. responsibility keep adults healthy. grown-ups responsible decisions life. Well sucks ""Oh yeah got it"" &lt;-Someone get it. wonder case, mild means MILD mild, mild ""not hospitalized"". reduced 11 cold symptoms would bit different symptoms. anecdote ‚â† data. Way easy hear one story stick without considering far representative.

I heard lots people refuse wear seatbelts became mandatory -- they'd heard people trapped cars accident.  correct answer. immunity means virus longer makes feel ill, still enter body (and leave someone else's) WBCs kill it. thought people taking seriously thanksgiving get togethers really discouraging see. Seems like hardly anyone skipped. Troll elsewhere. That's emotionally, that's functional. 


Emotional would change behaviour all, still felt cheated caught turned placebo. Nothing changed, brains hate probability, alternative outcomes, lack agency events. 


Functionally, lot would changed behaviour. Well-stated. I‚Äôm also study chatted participants, several bus drivers people community daily, POC, wanted something help end pandemic. 15,000 people vaccine group. 15,000, 11 got Covid, less severe version that. think phase 1 phase 2 check work safety. safe, move phase 3 conduct double blind trial 30,000 participants. give half vaccine half placebo. wait among 30,000 trial get Covid-19. certain number people get Covid, they'll unblind data see got placebo got vaccine. case 196 30,000 got Covid. Among 196, 11 got vaccine that's got effectiveness percentage. believe that‚Äôs called ‚Äúconfirmation bias‚Äù.

People (justifiably) scared. Lots people cope choosing denial. Then, there‚Äôs whole cohort misinformed. Either way, let go. Free vaccines every one April 1st  Wow. results charts good. would told us back May believed it. Congrats scientists. let's make ungodly amounts stuff. think we're already there. u Report nursing board. Seriously. eat like shit, honestly matter much time spend gym. fact, people overestimate many calories burn gym think carte blanche go nuts deserve it. I'm speaking here, ripped ever got life eating healthy eating less even going gym. seems like prevent infection. Watch Fauci's interview Chris Cuomo's show. oncology nurse.... 

FIRE ASS REVOKE LICENSE Eh, close. sub people make misspellings least _sound_ like they're trying say.

Here straight typo, assuming OP meant ""lung"", sounds nothing like ""lounge"". Even harshest lockdown NYC, one prohibited leaving home 4 months. don‚Äôt know talking about. must remember we're war COVID, enemy that's relentless. 

As Darth Vader said, fight, meet destiny"". talking significant sense talking dog two comments mine. incidence treatment group (literally zero) 30 control. numbers proper statistical test, best guess going significant fine. hospital workers longer considered people? Same. need least 30 samples claim central limit theorem basically says took bunch samples population contained 30 people each, sample means would follow normal distribution. Larger n, likely follow normal distribution. predictor statistical significance bare minimum lets use stat's tools analyze data mean original anti-vax movement vaccines proven decades anti-vax movement brand new vaccine released general public yet. Excellent point. 

Now I‚Äôm even stoked! guy died due virus, placebo. Idk talking about. sacrifice. horrifying see South Dakota tourism float Macy‚Äôs parade day. would anyone want go now? even pay float?! smoke 2-3 cigars week


I make unhealthy choices would also like prioritized [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Sure, also tough nut crack ""common cold"" catchall name dozens different viruses. agree saying ‚Äòbreaking rules‚Äô accurate. Wearing masks isolating may ‚Äòthe rules‚Äô everywhere. Yet, actions proven time slow spread covid. time seeing huge spikes covid patients hospitals stressed max, beyond infuriating. lol Yup! 1.1 million students nyc schools serves almost 800k chose remote. think like 45% 300k chose person white. White students make 15% nyc schools population. basically we‚Äôre risking increasing transmission white kids quality education. Mayor said today plans improve remote learning 800k families chose stay home. decision, claims help minority families, harm good. Ehh... hear disproportionately California, NY, Texas, raw population sizes, per-capita basis coastal states better center country is. 

California's 7-day case rate per-capita beaten Oregon, Texas, states coastline along Atlantic Ocean (and Vermont want get technical). Easily top ten. potential stupid question. Sorry advance:

I thinking long time could reopen better summer 2020. 

So obviously dilemma jn one point would need people get infected taht 70% population immune. Otherwise can't virus tough elderly ones preexisting conditions even hit young healthy people hard. figure herd immunity option would break health system.

Now vaccines coming. we, theoretically, finish vaccinating health care public service people greater risk death potential hardee infection, reopen businesses longer safer?

Of course mask wearing, social distancing constant hygiene disinfectants would still required. under-exposure, 185 infections placebo group. 

Let's go basics vaccine research works.

30,000 people given injections, told might vaccine might placebo, go home behave exactly vaccinated all, keep masking distancing work not. Neither volunteers researchers know got vaccine vs placebo, data recorded become accessible independent third party. volunteer receive regular phone calls monitor symptoms, become symptomatic Covid get swabbed. number infections recorded.

Over time, 196 people found infected. people infected. number high enough meet pre-established requirements. point, independent independent third party allowed access data revealed majority infections happened placebo group. vaccine work all, find 196 infections, would expect 90 vaccine group 90 placebo group. probability 185 vs 11 breakdown less 0.1% vaccine work. strong evidence vaccine working. 

If volunteers get enough exposure, total number infections would small trigger unmasking data, one would know whether vaccine worked not. slight fairness BMI slightly discriminate taller people (makes seem fatter actually are) makes shorter people seem thinner actually are. tall person BMI 30 probably equivalent average height person BMI 29 short person BMI 25 people equivalent average height person BMI 26.

It's pretty tiny though, like said. Maybe 1 point. Yes, there‚Äôs lot debate sides around challenge trials (when participants exposed covid purpose). considered awhile, make valid point, speeding process would accelerate vaccine studies possibly save lives. rate infection high, better worse, trial could completed timely manner least challenge trials wouldn‚Äôt helped much. And, perhaps part reason didn‚Äôt go even quickly vaccines were/are effective many people receiving vaccine got sick. shot vaccine come free microchip may get couple. Haha use TikTok thank in-depth explanation! exactly type answer looking for. I'm type person always date vaccinations gets flu shot every year, reason, part brain holding onto irrational fear end disaster. sincerely appreciate taking question seriously thorough response! Phizer available december right?

The FDA supposed meet December 10th discuss findings. sure things work that. never take vaccine :) Doubling lie, assuming people stupid lazy?

Classy.

Your statement pandemic task force scrapped 100% lie. 

Have nice day! Okay going work different going party. I‚Äôm considered essential coffee shop sells food. work public everyday afterwards go home spend time coworker one two friends. Giant ass parties like totally unnecessary inappropriate right now. Good advice most, friends live 2+ hours away taking pandemic seriously. meet they'd insist hike. know, need new friends. causing pain shoulder? completely agree use argument try convince get vaccinated far, far likely extremely rare possibility reinfection, much common occurrence false positive test ‚Äúasymptomatic case‚Äù. Basically nobody celebrities athletes college level getting retested confirm true positive case, people test positive assumed it. have, legit meaningful percentage false positives, almost diagnosed asymptomatic cases.

Your friend probably never actually first time. I‚Äôm sincerely grateful work places essential. Thank you. odd 196/30k got covid... ""you look like fat piece shit nothing better themself! life saving vaccination dont reflect poor choices!!!"" Actually, means real efficacy much lower, likely would cases placebo arm participants didn‚Äôt guess received placebo continued take precautions. Well, one among us rational time (otherwise we‚Äôd Vulcans) Pfizer, AstraZeneca, couple others testing vaccines people HIV, data whether vaccine effective immunocompromised people. I‚Äôm relieved effectiveness vaccines high enough don‚Äôt rely smooth brains like get us herd immunity. According recent Radiolab podcast, enough vaccine production 2 billion people end 2021. we‚Äôve still got long way go. gravestone kind statue, really. US talk frontline workers severely risk first... suspect plenty rich people get first well. point argument nonce. entire post about, try keep stop making BS. obese underlying condition know honestly met couple times wasn‚Äôt ask daughter even though I‚Äôm curious parents‚Äô health. Thats like us expect VRBPAC meeting mRNA-1273 likely **December 17, 2020**

lol. think laws sexually harassing people accurately described business say nude beach.

Oh, nude beach, beach people go nude. lol. Totally fine public street?

Being topless fine public, led path declaring anyone without clothes unquestioningly sexual harassing people,

Not said.

I said exposing genitals people public sexual harrasment. context place that's culturally acceptable, fine public toplessness, even areas that's culturally unacceptable.

lol. deciding beliefs backed positions extreme authoritarianism extreme libertarianism performing mental gymnastics trying reconcile two!

It's extreme authoritarianism say people able make look genitals public, guy. Get grip. might coincidence, biggest, ""it's flu"" guy know seriously overweight. keeps saying likelihood dying 0.1%. Dude literally take break halfway single flight stairs catch breath. gets COVID he's fucked. People like definitely come Starbucks. Phizer available december right? one workers local food bank tested positive Covid-19. Food bank shut entire month December. straight know I'm going manage groceries kid. Ughhhhh. feeling stress sure Monday afternoon. Antibodies seem last around 6 months according research posted here. vaccine need boosted afterwards. need use vaccine safely reintroduce virus body teach immune system again. FDA historically rolling reviews, think scientific reason. Almost every nation do. However, back September/October, Trump saying vaccine could election. Shortly after, FDA actually *tightened* review requirements, telling companies submit data least 2 months observation volunteers. want get political, think FDA got scared vaccine got early, one would trust Trump. realize 30 cases severe Covid placebo group, right? death? Waiting give people vaccine means could face significant harm (including hospitalization long-term effects Long Covid) die virus way also new science, proving quite unsafe. people would also face hunger waiting vaccinate would deepen global economic crisis.

You also realize mRNA bizarre dangerous chemical. Every cell body makes mRNA copying DNA uses build every protein body. scientists using mRNA get cells build Covid virus‚Äô spike protein immune system learn react it. think we're ""most endangered"" aka old people first Germany, ""endangered"" ""system relevant"" people (health workers). surprising, we're one oldest countries world old people absolutely decide elections. 1.3 million people care retirement homes. offence elderly, feels almost silly giving 90+ year old aunts going die day either way. even think would accept it.

I've testing people care homes gotta agree. people generally months less away death. hard say think we're going waste lot vaccines beginning. correct. part analysis missing politics, science. main difference flu covid, covid heavily skewed towards elderly influenza. infection fatality rates covid thus smaller young, greater old, compared influenza.

Don‚Äôt let get confused talk different it‚Äôs ‚Äúnovel‚Äù ‚Äúeven small percentage death terrible many infected!!‚Äù things always true, apply every yearly influenza outbreak. fact compelling research many people immunity covid past illnesses anyway. VZW 5g towers equipped spray nozzles. got covered.  100k come! would sneeze food?? used go concerts music festivals. like ‚Äúmy thing‚Äù last eight years.... can‚Äôt even fathom confined space many people right now. I‚Äôve seen drive concerts question bathroom situation. Like bruhhhh legit you‚Äôre gonna die without party little bit. It‚Äôs fine. Buy nice lights room crank volume bit chill tf out. can‚Äôt even get many people wear masks. point ton socialized medicine world yet reason governments rely private industry advance medical science space. socialized medicine worth touting website constantly maybe explain socialized medicine isn‚Äôt leading vaccine creation charge? first feeling. people also likely end hospital, saturate system. ""rewarding"" them, protecting healthcare system.  data willing vaccinate obese smokers? many age 25? reducing spread. 

Vaccinating 90 year old elderly interacts 3-4 people per day significant greater good vaccinating Walmart cashier interacts 100+ customers per day including risk family members.

Vaccines care morals, care reducing spread. Vaccinating essential workers superspreaders first makes sense reducing spread. Cold viruses contribute billions dollars lost productivity missed events, vacations etc. 

Also, people impaired immune systems much higher risk. Lung transplant patients, example, spend week hospital mild cold virus. 

A vaccine common colds would save tons money time protect people whose immune system can't protect itself. really fucked up, ask put look like I'm crazy I'm talking nurses Doctor children might super spreaders

They're super-spreaders. zero reason believe hundred years public education show us are.

My dentist's office three bays, hip-high counter bay. plexiglass barrier bays? No, patient area clerks. guy middle bay getting work done, attendant spraying high-speed drills, high probability aerosolized hanging around. rent office doubt anything done ventilation system.

I got teeth done got fuck out. six-month follow-up December I'm absolutely going. love dentist, I'll pre-pay appointment April May keep business, I'm showing there's vaccine, rates area go down, change set-up. looks like return normal next year Okay things go back normal 99% people. Yeah still crazy people wearing masks leaving home not. Personally, think got math -- therefore ethics -- wrong one. They've got 100% right testing safety, way wrong testing efficacy. pandemic, already know odds happens placebo. entire population placebo group. larger number people gotten vaccine, opinion.

Of course, trial might limited vaccine availability, case I'm completely wrong.

I understand wanted eliminate altered-behavior/risk-taking variable using double-blind trial. sounds like lot people *knew* got vaccine felt bit crappy days. people might increased risk-taking placebo group anyway. I'm convinced placebo group much value case.

Anyway, researchers certainly considered took best decision could, given decades understanding clinical trials. main point trial participants heroes remembered way. find interesting still don‚Äôt know whether vaccinated means can‚Äôt carrier transmitter covid-19. know vaccine chances fighting virus much higher. 

Considering won‚Äôt enough doses least year vaccinate general population, somewhat skeptical vaccine impact stopping spread. see likely we‚Äôll see fewer deaths rather see covid-19 become eradicated communities. hope I‚Äôm wrong! TikTok kids flat earthers Yeah, except 'belief' without actual evidence means sweet fuck all. Sadly, feeling might find herd immunity threshold may (IF even achievable considering growing number confirmed re-infection cases around world) far late. :( Wow, 0.04% death rate 50 really massive bloodbath! know people given vaccine infected even exposed coronavirus though? Well it‚Äôs food borne illness, yes, like surface someone sneezes you‚Äôre probably gonna get it. know people given vaccine infected even exposed coronavirus though? Also take account, time thousands children mixing schools. Fellow pediatric endocrinology here. obviously MUCH lower risk nurses referring (who heroes btw). However, possibility ordered help staff pediatric inpatient areas cases surge enough; also chronic medical condition. know extent willing comply, definitely line would instead take leave can, quit can't. enough money saved survive several months unemployment. people can't sacrifice happy hour, sacrificing life. already tested positive Covid-19 past antibodies, safe go school family members covid? currently 3rd quarantine, parents covid, immunity experiencing symptoms around me. school nurse says safe, wanted see others think this. two years herd immunity! Idk incredibly rare.

I friend caught twice, within 3 months.

He lives pretty big household. 2 brothers, 3 sisters, parents grandparent. One brothers caught spread friend, one sisters dad. friend asymptomatic. back July. mid October, caught coworker brought home again. time asymptomatic. relatively mild case, grandparent caught unfortunately passed away. Irrelevant pandemic fatigue? want shit fast next person, important things bring awareness to. general public seem understand care elective procedures include cancer treatments surgery. kin delayed months. never know much personal responsibility someone obese. Maybe they're young parents fed shitty diet. Maybe eating disorder. highly individual thing.  soon floated concept kids get sick can't spread lost trust every parent anyone ever worked child prioritizing economy health. glad hear hospital street going regional storage main distribution facility city. 

The reality probably won‚Äôt get choice though. high demand march/April it‚Äôs open public we‚Äôre going take whatever‚Äôs stock. Since quoting other, said dangerously incorrect. 

‚ÄúSo every CFM (cubic feet per minute) air passes filtration unit equivalent air exchanged via HVAC systems open windows.‚Äù I'm talking non-symptomatic quarantine traveling.

[A lot states requiring work customer service I‚Äôm tired telling people put masks won‚Äôt help them. Also, see people constantly taking masks sneeze.

My n=1 never, ever side effects flue shot actual prick needle.  Two things true. 1) Even US resource ability contact tracing, privacy laws would prevent effective tracing public transit. 2) Even US privacy laws, contact tracing program still objectively shitshow would able provide kind data areas fewer transmission able provide. seems odd saying fattest people smoke first get vaccine. Something feels ""of course I'm taking seriously"" mother visited family TG. live Texas think hoax. I'm black sheep coming year hole family may never mend. friend lives less mile notes mother takes precautions public. lying hurts, bad catching COVID make racist siblings happy see would hurt. Vaccines result neutralizing antibodies actually allow viruses hijack immune cells reproduce them. Thus allowing virus multiply unchecked causing severe infection. Check Antibody-Dependent Enhancement google.

For mRNA vaccine targeting spike protein virus, question would whether already existing antibody would attack cells start create fragments spike protein. Thank sharing this. I‚Äôm happy hear son worked hard understand bodily cues, difficult even neurotypical person. example son went good illustration trying say, even got words bit wrong. vaccines provided free not, cheaply leave one out. government subsidize want necessary. all, didn‚Äôt government contribute heavily help R&amp;D anyway? think might possible unlikely. Anyone takes part vaccine trial also likely taking recommended precautions. can‚Äôt imagine anti-masker taking part vaccine trial.

Because this, able assume else equal, would equal number infections control group inoculated group. Granted, that‚Äôs taking account region infection rates, race/ gender differences, starting health subjects, etc it‚Äôs likely best have. patients either discharged go freezer truck. say that. said ""people"" get vaccinated Christmas. day ""all people"" said nothing CVS.  makes sense going completely different city either spreading catching bringing home. restrictions go, probably one sensible ones we've had.  honestly take much dedication make simple lifestyle adjustments healthy. relatively healthy diet challenging accomplish. Regularly exercising actually gives energy, mitigates stress build up, feels great.

The amount time waste trying protect public people like you... 11th huge. Sf 2nd dense city country. Fuck PRC think comes back families - many people come contact normally. front-line worker exposed public constantly, vaccinated public exposed constantly. 

We prioritize vaccines places good. know people think high-risk populations (like elderly obese) good bets, that's 2/3s country right there. Instead, focus vaccinating people places likely cause outbreaks. 

We vaccinating people allowing fly planes, ride trains, sit churches concerts. Yeah, people selfish stupid, end day one vaccine worth hundred vaccines people likely spread COVID first place. guess I‚Äôd imagine they‚Äôd test people exposed getting virus 30k people don‚Äôt seem chance getting it. +10k people day Michigan getting yet course whole study 196 people got it...that‚Äôs pretty small sample size, 196 people expediting mass roll world. vaccine given older people ones risk due medical conditions. know pushed everyone since everyone gets flu shot every year. joke. family wearing masks staying large public gatherings been. Thanksgiving safer going shopping Black Friday, reason totally ok ""experts"". provide direct patient care residents.

You can't report pooled test, individual test. stop moving goal post. I‚Äôm assuming, maybe 35-50% general population get vaccine, provided everyone safe, remaining people haven‚Äôt taken probably get (probably 90-95% people) stuff slowly open back avoid issues vaccine may have. guess though :) mean, they‚Äôre already open packed right (for better worse) What‚Äôs odd that? That‚Äôs entirely expected. said ""at least"". Many northern governors done good-to-great job handling pandemic. (Republican!) governor around done pretty decent job, would say.

Hopefully winter last surge Covid everyone make through. Emphasis ""may"". Now, watch wind like hospitals going overwhelmed back summer never happened. wonder many people refuse take Fauci seriously. Same. I‚Äôm slut covid vaccines. Like - stick me.  Well don‚Äôt think right idea reopen 4 days everyone go mingle meet close back again. make sense? 

Best thing vaccine distributed around country start relax restrictions long isn‚Äôt spike cases. Professional sport disposable activity ever invented. always first stop last start. sponsorship redirected paying fight covid help affected economic impacts across society. want holiday dinner deeply racist grandmother pedophile uncle again. I'm obese. Barely, we're looking BMI, yep, line. working it, well working mental health (a contributing factor thank binge emotional eating stressed). But, struggle.

The stuff result fat enough really push higher risk categories. So, I'll wait shot available general public thanks. work home, easily minimize contact others, continue work quite fat. I'll let others greater need go first.


Edit bc phone hleping type Wow , one says ‚Äûwrong‚Äú thing canceled That's sory approach UK vaccine minister taking. He's said compulsory businesses allowed ask proof vaccination entry. almost sounds like he's encouraging businesses think article best way look air purifiers possible layer protection, solution. Rotating outside air would better dilute viral load. That's statistical significance works afai remmeber. lol right üòÇ It‚Äôs vaccinating many people possible.

I completely disagree that. handful people high risk, right. high-risk difficult define. risk scale. obvious cut-off. could give everybody 100, 90, 80, ... point decide give obese people instead old people?

Distribution very, difficult mRNA vaccines, especially Pfizer, would favor facilitating distribution.

Anyway, I'm happy we're finally point argument. choice gets first really important; everyone access within months. no!! stay home. think hard watch now, wait vaccinations given us herd immunity listen person person claim never got it, big deal, people isolated protect idiots. dark shrink labor pool significantly wages rise. Scarcity labor. 

Many historians believe enlightenment began peasants post plague suddenly paid well. fucking selfish.  good new know it, proven before. You‚Äôre still path success long haven‚Äôt given up. importantly, requires temperature standard refrigerator, deeeep freeze others gave everyone million vaccinations day would take 6 months control maybe 3 months mostly gone.

We going giving million vaccines day while.

Edit: math. 350 million Americans. 30 million per month.  Almost 12 months everyone. 6 months half population. one spreading misinformation. Children get infected driver pandemic. Listen science. [Fat shaming doesn‚Äôt public health approach get people healthier weight. Focusing access nutritious foods, healthcare access, even pulling people poverty far effective approaches.

The thought people don‚Äôt feel bad obese ludicrous. anything, shaming people makes withdraw more, become depressed, [makes less agree aren‚Äôt addressing obesity crisis many Americans poverty unable access nutrient dense, less processed foods. Healthcare also hard access prohibitively expensive focused fee service instead overall health outcomes. plan guess publicly teasing mocking people (or ads tell people obese unhealthy- duh, know!) isn‚Äôt plan all. Pfizer Moderna announced vaccines cost $20 without insurance. AstraZeneca's cost $5. 

Even government leaves us dry (which Trump definitely might try do, Biden won't), almost everyone able afford them. risky thing lot people desperate irrational, completely valid reasons raise concerns vaccines. questions *should* asking. Vaccination safe every vaccine gets widely deployed rigorously vetted, vaccination inherently safe technology. However, /u/yaolilylu outlined, concerns addressable seems reasonable go forth despite concerns. What. Why. I've isolating trying best stay healthy, would someone smokes (which good health) prioritized me? Thanks reply, we‚Äôre pretty much joined hip moment! seen estimates time frame, know yet? Generally yeah. However, I've read articles people getting twice something different strains passing around. vaccine could still helpful getting broader immunity even already caught it.

Disclaimer: virologist epidemiologist. I'll need see source that.

1 5 (or even 10) coronavirus cases require hospitalization. Maybe we're looking 75+ category, certainly average healthy adults. close. I'd think it'd harder tall people get covid head start social distancing higher everyone.... literally trying kill people making wildly false claims. would train drill public health media spokesperson training, classic DANGEROUS spreader false information harms public.  trained identify people like mitigate damage cause. clearly let ignorance get way outlandish claims even people die result.

Again ""study"" claimed seen????? fair find drive thru inconvenient walking paying like normal. line cars sometimes take forever, it‚Äôs harder conveniently ensure got correct order, even handing payment cashier requires somewhat awkward movement. ""b-b-but th-t-that means go back WORK!! Experts warn coronavirus surge widespread Thanksgiving travel **and crowded doorbusters due black friday**

FTFY article author nerve call asshole called it.

Daddy Trump taught okay grown adult act like people question him. Think reports miracle cures come last 9 months shot month later. Think many health risks smokers breathing putting much higher risk heart disease. Think many smokers either obese bad health general. Anything possible bet studies written smoker.   Almost many California... state twice population LOT testing. Someone else bite comment, got things atm people hanging large crowds blame.

black friday nutshell. Yes That's great way put it. Don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre getting downvoted something accurate word lockdown misused. significant lockdown anywhere North America Europe. Half-assed measures referred different word. Hmmm NY reopen schools? That‚Äôs sad problem year. always get Friday now, bad reactions before.

Ironically since switching Fridays bad symptoms. infected, symptomatic. sub insane lol Generally advised still get routine health screenings want miss potentially life threatening condition. high risk I'd probably call doctor's office recommendation. None reports I‚Äôve read indicated change *definitely* permanent. long term order weeks/months longer TBD. pediatrician didn‚Äôt seem worried long term effects, said daughter would probably get little cold worse RSV kills lot infants. Lots diseases like flu example, come cardiac changes similar cognitive issues COVID. live bucket list while. need planning protect groups can't get vaccinated, realistically there's *just way* significant number people going continue COVID restrictions get vaccine. hope get soon!!!! get that‚Äôs care about. Christ, hope rate don‚Äôt give anti maskers access vaccine sooner name saving lives. think report OSHA bad USA leaders acknowledge Black Friday same.

Instead families celebrating Thanksgiving blamed spread, instead for-profit corporations. said last. tens millions people aren‚Äôt deemed ‚Äúessential,‚Äù pro athletes last? single instead Hollywood? mess. financial ruin anxiety many facing due lockdowns equally bad time goes imo. little longer perhaps dude primed go. curve go exponential eliminate community spread. lock properly like Wuhan Australia, done once, stop eliminating community spread. 
If eliminate community spread, virus, 5 times contiguous flu, back full force perfect vaccine administered entire population. rushed vaccines perfectly safe effective? entire population take them? One man figure head tv Trump trying encourage base believe him. same. task force backed government near 300k deaths. Almost like dismantled something. I'm sorry want argue semantics bill Clinton style make right. photos bodies El Paso showed laid storage shelves buy Home Depot. really got me. Yeah, playoffs set number weeks, NHL teams fraction players staff NFL team.  NFL could definitely something like playoffs, trying regular season would impossible. former obese person relate this. came realization needed change it‚Äôs daunting. think people situation easier time telling aren‚Äôt high risk category staying denial. *opinion* regarding DeVos irrelevant. current head nation‚Äôs Education Department statements matter public record. Regardless feel statements, person establishing policy believes don‚Äôt spread thats effectively matters. Notwithstanding claim ‚Äúno one‚Äù stated that, 100% rebutted public statements. want try take someone task need careful wording.

Since you‚Äôve demonstrated inability and/or unwillingness discuss facts good faith I‚Äôm going offer rudimentary lesson logic rest case responses:

When DeVos states children ‚ÄúCOVID stoppers‚Äù Fauci rebuts ‚Äúnot children 9‚Äù leaves status children younger 10 undisputed state, dictates corollary wrote rather interpretation. Furthermore, want assess research article cited read methodology. It‚Äôs almost funny continue qualify claim with, ‚Äúavailable evidence‚Äù that‚Äôs precisely concern raised discussion: tests conducted adequately make claim children younger 10 less likely spread viral infection. fact, it‚Äôs nonsensical claim younger children *less* likely spread viral infections older children adults. ridiculousness claim might possibly absence evidence substantiate claim rationale might case making parents caregivers increasingly skeptical claim made basis health data rather economic. think important bring vaccine rushed people make out. fact ""rushed"" part beurocratic (I can't spell word) stuff end. Tests gone faster, mostly companies devoting much resources many people catching covid-19.

It's worth noting vaccines long term side effects. parts could added preservatives adjuvants, long term tests, think covid-19 vaccines even adjuvants.

Tldr; vaccines ever short term effects would already seen now. covid-19 vaccine safe flu vaccine blood covenant thicker water womb actual phrase. means bonds choose create meaningful share dna someone Misleading (to degree) article title holy hell. 

New York getting ready anticipated holiday surge. cases positivity gone pretty significantly past month half, we‚Äôre still manageable territory terms hospitalizations capacity. Cuomo proactive wants get extra capacity potential medical workers now, surge hits. 

We remember unlike March, covid centralized northeast, New York, running wild almost every single state country, meaning extra doctors nurses came NY‚Äôs help spring can‚Äôt time around. prepare time there‚Äôs fallback aid come help out. 

Most importantly announced there‚Äôs going guidelines revolving around hospitalizations could dictate another NY PAUSE/stay home order state. hope don‚Äôt need it, anticipate will. matter when, unfortunately. Nope well informed could gotten placebo taking recommended precautions everyone else. means production mostly virtual sometimes play role. There‚Äôs ton factors come play feel like America become Donald Trump. Even officials whatever fuck want. That's thing, people often SAY safety measures place (masks, social distancing, etc.) reality happen. isolate wants to. Hell, island excuse well. understand narrative inevitable coming from. Incompetence? Coping mechanism?  all. :( get vaccine placebo live life. idea get sample comparing two groups see vaccine works. certain point view. Indeed, like OP used wonder medical studies drug trials paid little volunteers. Found paid much more, would form coercion less fortunate would lining studies trials. 70% bigger. [Check ""ALL ever need know vaccinations"" wanna learn Southern California also majority state's population population density though. LA COUNTY alone 1/4 state population. Care elaborate? forgetting major difference - viral load. Copious distance, great ventilation, limiting time greatly decreases chances of:

- Getting infected first place
- Getting particularly nasty infection. 

...all due reduced viral load. 

Furthermore, original plan thanksgiving going plan every visit:

- Work home week, stay put entire time (while 14 day quarantine pretty much guarantee good, vast majority symptoms appear day 6, would mean days 3-6 critical stay put. Asymptomatic spread course possibility, low chance exposure first place, lower likelihood shedding virus asymptomatic, unreasonable).
- Visit home
- distanced gathering 4 - two us one table, two us another, manage time spent sharing room, keep HVAC going windows open. Every time. 

The difference due knowing 100% vicinity infected individual, visit plans off. exposed friday week already planned working home. 

I'm going visit parents knowing I've taken every reasonable precaution so. I'd much rather risk minuscule chance infecting one seeing - dad who's dealing end life issues, discussed already tradeoff complete, near complete distance vs. trying manage risk visits - I'm going focused virus miss likely last months dad's life fear it. calculated risk I'm willing take every step navigate carefully.

I'm also NYS bad parts state better good parts many states. Overall - I'd fine, case, played extra safe. [You individually rational, please read see collectively country need persuaded. anything? Absolutely, still seems incredibly stupid throw caution wind end sight.

I mean people need go stores .. find strange suddenly primary route transmission months .. expert cannot incentivize positive negative outcomes want bias behaviors study. participants knew opportunity historic pandemic virus vaccine named got virus died, guarantee idiotic glory/legacy seekers would go it. people study trying get infected would skew outcomes. Maybe people dying anyway disclose underlying cancer researchers. 

Plus multiple people die placebo trial? That's unfair. Fairness pillar highly regulated clinical trials. Many people die cancer trials get randomized standard care. two-dose vaccine, considered immune enough resume normal life? first dose? second? Sometime that? picture interesting...

According what? We've trials 10's thousands participants, issues whatsoever. Claiming risk high without backing statement silly.

I'm saying way vaccinate, traditional methods like Oxford one utilizes plenty merit. However, mistakes happened testing, would temper expectations Oxford one would hit 90% re-trial half-dose/full-dose method.

Thanksgiving compounding Christmas New Years trifecta doom. think we'll seeing 3,000 deaths day probably 300,000+ cases per day. I'd like say would scare people, honestly, point, think there's number make people taking seriously change way. think difference parties go to.

* Vaccine continues generally well tolerated; serious safety concerns identified dat Judges interpret apply law. don‚Äôt create based values freedoms. another fooled misleading information. top 5 already vaccine would probably riskier Covid would be.  really good friend colleague working manufacturing portion Moderna vaccine, plugged science portion clinical trial piece well.

There three key things Moderna's vaccine significant: 1) stored regular OTS freezer/refrigerators. means perfect rural parts country may robust cold-chain logistics; 2) require two doses. That's going problem compliance, especially people pay pocket, would likely case rural areas healthcare problem, financially logistically; 3) Field reports Phase 3 trials promising, significant events would compromise getting EUA FDA. However, people reported feeling awful time first dosing. complicate compliance. get $2000 check Bill Gates though? I'm antivaxx all, fully date mini me, anyone else hesitant due rach vaccine trial ""one upping"" efficacy previous one? effective years research, alarm bells going head this. Key points:

In times like this, things exactly legal. That's always been. worry legal illegal disaster passed matter happens executive branhes ignore law.

You understand really repercussion courts tell state can't that. state pass law minor changes go right back matter chance real repercussions court rulings low.

If legislators want pass laws know unconstitutional roll challenged executive branches really interpret law enforce see fit courts ask stop. import realize courts really ask. legislators courts much power laws get enforced hard imagine point enforcement power control lies system. kind theory EXECUTED executive branch. Laws sit nothing executive wants enforced max want. That's HUGE amount wiggle room without even controversial. want get controversial aggressively bypass courts admin interpret law see fit.

YOU MAY THINK, federal government would swoop make courts follow federal constitutional law, really that's much harder sounds. state simply keeps electing people enforce law see fit, that's that. Feds mostly watch complain like they've cannabis abortion.

If something simple cannabis laugh federal therefore constitutional law, stands reason lot issues could well.

So.. kid yourself. mostly mob rule head applicable executive branch says. courts ethics recommendations passive systems rarely major impacts. Mob rule also means consumers apply market forces corporations corporations convinced adopt, crazy rules. 

If Walmart wants make everybody wear bowtie come store, that's definitely right owners/operators business. silly, it. inatre freedoms. guaranteed limits GOVERNMENT power. limits individual, business group power.

When global disaster world wars happen, freedoms THOUGHT didn't, become much clear. 

I'm worried people rising up, hard deal with, especially gather easy identify groups. Lol ‚Äúhigh quality person‚Äù moderated calling covid hoax day. Something tells don‚Äôt need posting privileges sub. reporting cases abysmal. Governments put restrictions gatherings. Every city occupancy limits fire codes buildings. can't single one group tighter restrictions others. happens cases church ""wins"". Oh agree 1000000%. still believe docs nurses get first. Even without pandemic massive shortage healthcare professionals. worry, nurse practitioners full practice autonomy soon. moment soon. honey, want unrestricted license.... now's chance.

Yeah I'm one burnt ones. empathy drying up. I'm tired. Florida. Literal hell earth point. post anything day....link? per morning's NY Times news email:

""If track number new cases, fairly accurately predict number deaths three weeks later. Every 100 new cases U.S. led average 1.7 deaths, three-week lag.""

Yes, Thanksgiving caused spread. Yes, deaths occur spread. People continue live higher risk lifestyles prioritized trials. response even remotely uncivil? makes sense. (no one got developed severe CV) based many people got CV many received vaccine. surprising headlines fool people. ask service zoom option. many funeral parlors do.

otherwise, stay outside near car. People understand find running get 20 tests (MRI's, Xrays, bloodwork, sleep studies etc) let live world everyone honest, comes big price. amazing! survive Covid, much worse. mean, call Bay Area so... overall price living nothing compared West Coast.

Most called taking new patients one told even patient would 10 days could see him. I‚Äôm sure vets offices would struggling right now. Seems demand supply. seems that, news regarding renewed lockdowns stricter measures (such banning in-person dining), little discussion expanding hospital capacity.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember, original lockdowns early spring advertised method avoid exceeding hospital capacity. all, spread slowed, would lower peak hospitalizations. 

&amp;#x200B;

But also knowing burden lockdowns would impose pretty much everyone, measures taken expand hospital capacity, hospitals would overwhelmed restrictions repealed. Field hospitals set up. Navy deployed hospital ships. 

But new restrictions lockdowns, little stories plans set new field hospitals otherwise expand hospital capacity able handle peak hospitalizations restrictions lifted, importantly, much capacity take handle peak hospitalizations, long take expand hospital capacity. 

Are stories hospital capacity expansion simply front page news? Nice straw man again. That's like saying I'm calling wood steel evil people use make hammers hit people. 

Please, invite you, ""refer bodily autonomy evil""? used word evil describe argument people hiding behind concept avoid contributing killing millions people avoidable plague.

No, I'm bodily autonomy...up point someone refuses take vaccine help save millions lives. Then, yes, evil. come slippery slope bullshit. Volunteers study told expose virus, supposed live lives normally take normal precautions already doing. 30,000. 30 severe cases. Non vaccine group.

It actually significant trial size none got severe. post suspiciously familiar one day Well nice knowing ya Brazil.

But one you, presumably healthy individual (aka like country) going live longer without? tell someone's rough age scar. multi-needle ""thumbtack"" scar brands lot us. :-P know it‚Äôs shitty bet stuff like people suffer, since it‚Äôs illegal I‚Äôm senator access insider trading info, wink wink. would good time buy Moderna stocks? regards mild cases, been, yes. regards unfortunately get severe case, no, like cold flu.

You're dishonest try claim majority mild cases much worse cold flu. opposed off-world country? ... know read saying correctly. 

I meant nurses, doctors, frontline workers (on average) kind thrown wolves without much visible emotional/mental support talk through. Meaning, think given therapy/counseling sessions free hospital help cope insane trauma experiencing right (which is, fair, much greater anything experience with, especially scale). give additional coping mechanisms mental fortification currently handled result awful fallout (which already happening; search ""nurses Covid ICU""). Giving breaks would help, but, like stated, possible right due sheer number patients. 

To make analogy, I'm proposing give support way soldiers need ammo, ballistics protection, medical attention, protective barriers, wound repair kits, etc. still war still fighting like everyone else, equipped, support comrades, lean others behind front lines. feel isolated (even among foxhole buddies) able tactically effective, even situation still sucks. 

To use analogy, kind leaning towards opinion ""well, gun helmet, stay till over. Oh well, others fighting suck ends.""

I'm saying quit, could help cope insane situation. suspicious all, started trials around time similar number participants country. would suspicious one way ahead other. Could also thyroid issue. know someone blew gained 30+lbs 3 months without changing diet all. Also pituary gland tumor cause cortisol overload weight gain even eating strict healthy diet. Sure cases, calories calories out, people got bad luck others blessed super high metabolisms (I've also known slim people treated bodies like garbage cans) seem like see 196/30k though. see numbers state 10k infections day.. that's flip side coin need try remember. sacrifice means person, millions others, likely actually survive this. I'm fairly sure would rather remembered way poor guy got wrong 50% trial. Anyone linked medical field first, every single person deemed essential next, sadly US probably sports stars ultra wealthy first. Rhode Island really small state know lot people, people got together thanksgiving... difficult define. risk scale. obvious cut-off. 

Yeah, that's try understand well... how, actual cut-off?

You hear lot diabetes whole debate, see pictur person referencing, kinda draw conclusion (sometimes incorrectly) talking ""Type 2"" diabetes, type much likely overweight (not all) put position.

As otherwise healthy Type 1 diabetic, BMI 22-23, stand? get diabetes (even though well controlled)? get I'm fat?

Sidenote: I'm still angry government handling diabetes. Apparently Type 2 diabetics get insulin supplies free due new(ish) National Health Insurance (even though put position need it), Type 1 diabetics get anything free (even though got due luck draw). Bitter? I'm bitter! suggest let people die perceive caring health? I'm wait see camp. would like information exactly mRNA vaccine works compared regular vaccine. well clear numbers side effects vaccine. believe they're perfectly safe would nice see concise literature it. I've tried looking seem find information way reading level. think it‚Äôs that‚Äôs Pfizer located. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Article created Congress, Article 2 executive branch, Article 3 federal judiciary. really try reading Constitution ranting internet. God damn dude. That‚Äôs intense. would think spaniards would learnt first wave - like linning vaccine! Yeah partly true lets say cousin doctor, cannot cite anything cousin said? :))

Anyways thats rhetorical question. ‚ÄúFor Dummies‚Äù cells produce Plasma Cells

Also first cells bind displayed antigen using receptor called cell helper cells recognize antigen receive signals antigen-presenting cells, activate; activated helper cells multiply activate cytotoxic cells B cells. Helper cells also send signals phagocytes cause become efficient killers.

What miss believe Cells produce antibodies?

Your second link says Cells inform antibodies help production. they‚Äôre main actor creating antibodies. 

This splitting hairs it‚Äôs important you‚Äôre talking lay person like I‚Äôm less apt believe statements they‚Äôre incorrect. large part problem governments think force people.

Make something rich we'll connected get others falling get it. would huge deal immunosuppressed. autoimmune disease. Last winter youngest (17f) caught cold came work neighboring state. (Yes, I'm lucky kid old still likes tag along hang out)

She got sniffles 72hrs. got 104 fever 6 weeks pneumonia stop meds keep wheelchair 10 weeks. similar approach though differences. working separately. true. They're still minority. Even agreed get vaccinated priorities first.

Even get vaccinated we're still better off. Especially moderna vaccine nearly 100% effective get sick end mild case.

We're better telling people can't participate society vaccinate.

My company going require employees vaccinated. Proof required. guess I'm missing something: effectiveness measured getting vaccine well?

So ""normal"" circumstances people using masks social distancing people likely exposed viral load could lead contracting disease.

While would expect controls people getting vaccine vs. (and accounts results good), question whether additional protections people using affecting overall numbers.

For example (using round numbers make easy). normal circumstances, 20/100 people get virus, masks social distancing becomes 10/100, 50% effectiveness masks/social distancing/etc

(i realize number low, using illustration)

The numbers reported saying 10/100 getting (the placebo group, masks social distancing) 90% effective becomes 1/100 vaccine test group. 

The question effective without additional protections masks social distancing? I'm sure assume linear relationship two (i.e. vaccine protects use masks rate protects don't). might actually better, might worse. maybe assume linear relationship? really question. Pets don‚Äôt generally drive office swipe credit card. lots things. want talk vs would, taken serious forced quarantine paired serious contact tracing. 

I agree, trying figure things out, united states incompetent place planet seems. Dr Fauci abc live looks like saw heard terrible shit going air I‚Äôm agreement sentiment.  Oh yeah, definitely closed ears. got argument mom aunt yesterday want start planning large family Christmas get together. said extremely irresponsible disrespectful health care workers people lost someone COVID. said needed ‚Äúhave grace‚Äù ‚Äúlive life‚Äù. Talking waste energy point. don‚Äôt get now, never will. 

I‚Äôm sure want spend future holidays family pandemic seeing behavior this. It‚Äôs depressing. Plenty doctors downplaying covid well. nurses. ""No one"" context discussion public health experts say, suggest meant one world plain stupid. while. suggest smoking instead, work fast. get vaccinated? weirdo Tests sensitive cant tell difference dead virus alive. like 70% people test positive 90 days afterwards this.  could take while, get morbidly obese like 100 pounds overweight. Quicker smart smoking. best part figure severe disease prevented. Even small sample size means 100%, vaccinating at-risk groups bring deaths hospitalizations something like standard pandemic influenza worst, justifying lifting restrictions including mask mandates. Nice assume tried apples, cranberries cinnamon. Apples dried sauce. Nuts brown sugar good additions well. think mean nocebo effect. flipside placebo, describes negative effects instead positive ones. authority past feeling way have? can‚Äôt take away someone‚Äôs nursing license. It‚Äôs fucking super difficult process requires many levels court litigation. It‚Äôs simple ‚Äútaking away.‚Äù

Edit: mention state nursing board loses case right counter sue things like defamation regain lost income. fire future hr searches name they‚Äôll see this. Ideally point federal government would developed teams deploy crisis areas. team would include physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists comfortable working together along scribe trained handle various EMR systems. done feds state state solution made. 

It ridiculous point pandemic instituted this. continue willing work conditions stunned lack planning standardized conditions. hospitals want staff come days earlier shift EMR training places give training all, trying care patients fight computer system time. 

Some places seasoned nurses nurses area expertise. love Med/Surg nurses often times measure kids pounds, don‚Äôt know set pelvic, never used Ortho glass before. aren‚Äôt med/Surg tasks understand issues takes Twice long get things done. Three times, can‚Äôt figure things hospital. 

There reason ER chaos chaos‚Äôs sake. world erratic enough. feels much like powers idea boots ground actually get things done. Americans who're leery vaccine experiments.

I wonder why... Thanks opinion  much oxygen water, inhaling would give super powers lizard people want those. Super powers like asphyxiation pneumonia. Probably true reading comprehension one weakest I‚Äôve ever seen internet, even exaggerating. went grocery store notice checking out, cashier eating indoors! I'm wondering risk (of wearing mask) situation. clarify, live area indoor dining museums shutdown. Question, since Pfizer Modena vaccines, different? competing, working together make vaccine? Nah dude, Chicken Pox thing past.  Holyyyy fuck. chick hometown. knew back day. 

She's always crazy.  understand that. However, that's point. People willingly spreading kind behavior. it, everyone needs follow rules.

Look NFL. Every player, coach, essential staff member tested every single day. normal person kind attention access....and *they still spread it* other.

If that's lesson rest population, know is. Yes, breaking rules willingly participating spread. ""Please get mad daddy China"" I'm sure odd first, bet snap back normal groove sooner rather later. Human social adaptation that. Alaskans allowed in? live miles away Yukon never heard anyone town allowed get supplies. I‚Äôm advocate quarantine, something isn‚Äôt adding up.

If whole bunch data points clustered around mean one data point way generally refer outlier. 

It importance understand outlier likely significant importance live outlier, necessarily indication grouped points incorrect. live everyone wearing masks live southern state idk country even comes close Belgium's Virus Death Rate way ahead bub You‚Äôve paying attention clue you‚Äôre talking think that‚Äôs case. EUAs flying about, anything, fast. 

We already see happens FDA approves fast tracked drugs. There‚Äôs 40% increase likelihood serious safety issues lack efficacy later found. funny we're almost December people still going ""like cold flu"" narrative. course, question is, seem if, pharma firms primarily focus American market leave Europe later? guy smart he's repeating comment that's made every moron social media one died covid placebo trial lol. sure talking article mentions that. hope understand placebo trial is. placebo trial receive treatment acts control experiment. treatment vaccine, generates antibodies. virus, SARS-COV-2. Moderna going inject anyone virus chance dying. Come man, stop spreading fake shit. literally know people sick refused get tested want forced stay home. severe disease including death brought low levels vaccinating *high-risk groups*, prevent hospitals becoming overwhelmed. Since purpose mask mandates stop hospitals becoming overwhelmed, reason continue mandate masks high-risk groups vaccinated, say mask *recommendations* unreasonable. Maybe worn mask?

Too soon? might stupid question expose trial participants virus? seems super unethical expose people especially control group exact reason. Why? keep told mask keep safe. may still get infected, would cut transmission someone else? words antibodies clear virus faster lower chance passing on? wait, chicken pox parties anymore? looking loophole. Reading things like day-after-day-after-day really making despise country. veteran that, truly believe whole childhood based around elaborate work conmen. truly believed country ""great,"" ""the best world offer."" absolute load horse shit, would take back service heartbeat possibility, country composed morons every level. made claim provide evidence. don‚Äôt buy it‚Äôs physically impossible distribute vaccine large ways. It‚Äôs nice skeptical. It‚Äôs bad pessimist. 

I think there‚Äôs two situations here, pandemic: personal public. general public may issues rolling vaccine large groups rural suburban people US due logistics issues. Black people incredibly unlikely vaccinated due history mistrusting government. Conservatives believe it‚Äôs hoax microchip. Etc etc. 

But live well connected major city world leading medical centers science believing government. It‚Äôs incredibly likely I‚Äôll access 95% effective vaccine young healthy person March April. point really don‚Äôt care everyone else choose believe it‚Äôs hoax government testing them. stay city relative herd immunity travel it‚Äôs safe. 

I think you‚Äôre thinking public issue transposing personal issue. Logistically practically there‚Äôs reason believe won‚Äôt available major cities come April. reason believe country won‚Äôt reach herd immunity April. things true. would stupid them. think makes sense. Generalizing broadly doesn‚Äôt really make sense different every state approached this. also speaks places really rough peaks (Texas, florida) continuing see things get worse again; haven‚Äôt actually 8x infections. Also, people saying places peak begin go down, indicating people left infect. don‚Äôt agree this, think case laid increases 2-4 weeks gap can‚Äôt perceive numbers, matter high go. mom, cousin, friend, neighbor works hospital starts sharing come hospital right they‚Äôll turn away, matter covid not. sudden people decide go stuff getting care something perceive.

http://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMp1204170 Yeah imagine family coercing parent kid dying. can‚Äôt money risks need managed without monetary gain mind. seems higher proportion population obese rural areas vs urban. It'll interesting difference geography terms vaccination prioritization given urban areas higher risk. also several states mid Atlantic large population centers hit hard yet (PA, MD, DC, VA).  heard channel another tested people multiple co-morbidities, probably some. That's bad, mostly them. people get vaccinated, lower RO is, need achieve herd immunity eradicating disease anyway. managing it. can't get enough people fast enough eradicate it, people get vaccinated mostly bring negative consequences coming several months.

For sane people need avoid suicidal morons follow mitigation efforts possible/practical. Exactly. don‚Äôt care gifts whatsoever, cheer positivity season brings. Definitely need ever right yet doesnt need since hes already survived Covid. Arguably previous comment thread shows lack empathy 9 people dying per day difference two approaches... addition people significant morbidity long term sequelae illness.

With vaccine available shortly, delaying death may allow us outright prevent it.

To clear I'm saying Sweden lock down. want highlight contrasting issues. I'm thinking going families Christmas , bother's family recovered Covid then, rest siblings already recovered.

I consider good thing serious possibility. stage pandemic believe surfaces low risk, look [""The estimated risk infection touching contaminated surface low (less 5 10,000), suggesting fomites play minimal role SARS-CoV-2 community like three four possible case studies fomite transmission, vs hundreds direct person-to-person transmission.

That's run good electric police cities burn down, people kept working entire time.

The industries hard hit may visual reminders, businesses stay open adapted business models. 

Hardware stores, Walmart, Grocery stores, office supplies Amazon warehouses shipping services ANYTHING even remotely essential pretty much open entire time.

That's unemployment 'only' goes 14% like 80%. people, far, stayed employed making similar money made pandemic. Many people took money SAVED going much bough home upgrades retail goods instead vs hoarding wages fear. That's markets crashed. great shuffling money business low tangible good markets like travel bars kind pay memories nothing left show investment, people effectively making tangible investments. That, bad people, good majority represents smarter investment spending still helping deter systemic deflation. 

So.. really.. kept spending less bars restaurants would better positions fiscally. Hardly new concept, seeing forced many people interesting perhaps proof concept high consumption economies great useful look. think always theory though. High consumption makes business easy, wind much end day blow half disposable income momentary conveniences overpriced social gatherings. That's good, quite concerning article.

Even article states: *""Some experts worry injecting first vaccine kind hundreds million people quickly.""*

And agree. 

The technology seems new deployed en-masse, risk high.

Could mRNA vaccine work well? Yes. 

Will it? see. would think much slower ramp-up several years solution. 5-10 years see effects humans.

mRNA treatments obvious option at-risk patients, like cancer patients, high chance dying (let's say 50%). point give take percent chance mRNA, cares? people knew basically got real shot- I‚Äôm assuming placebo obvious side effects definitely run bottleneck start hoarding get people second dose time. It‚Äôs going create supply chain issue sure. That's mantra entire pandemic. ""We're going cancel two weeks, hope it'll better then."" Spoiler alert: be. We're taking measures slow things down, vaccine. world would ""make things better""? literally leaders every level trying placate groups, stems soon-to-be-former President Trump politicizing whole thing. Ahh yes, daily dose outrage. Thanks Washington Post! Well obviously didn‚Äôt really mean ‚Äúscarred lounge‚Äù. would silly!

What really meant ‚Äúscared lung‚Äù ... Definitely NC IDK. I've seen MDs pretty dumb stuff personal lives. whole anti mask Covid thing seems motivated politics ego. He‚Äôs unlucky, lungs scarred, cries, cries, cries lonely bed, thinking - covid‚Äôs nothing, liberal plot... This. well empathy/sympathy running low. bit cart horse there. FDA hearing emergency approval December 10th. too! supposed get married past summer shifted August 2021 I‚Äôm actually optimistic happen! One best friends single mom worked way nursing school. started working floor weeks ago. three kids. I‚Äôm really concerned her. One good friends nurse single mom well. She‚Äôs already covid. hospital treated like shit made use paid time quarantine still spent days unpaid. Maybe specifically state's vaccine plan. available somewhere someone explain something scientific studies me? essentially say 90%+ efficacy great numbers. people actually exposed virus? quarantining home? actually got real vaccine actually exposed virus reliable %'s?

They recruit large number people willing test vaccine. Half* given real vaccine candidate, half given placebo (basically fake injection). 20,000 people, get 10,000 group. important thing people split groups randomly know group (we say *blinded*). people know got real deal not, behave same. random groupings blinding assume people two groups subject amount infection. simply wait untill certain number people get infected (the threshold number called end-point based statistics).

Now. Let us say reached endpoint see 200 people placebo group gotten infected, corresponds 2% people. Now, groups randomized blinded, decent assumption people vaccine group subject rate infection, meaning would expect see rate infected people 2%. However, say see 10 infected people group. assumption believe 190 people would infected vaccine. means vaccine blocked 190 200 ""infections"", therefore 95% effective. Now, math example highly simplifed. reality would use much advanced statistics math analyse situation say expect exact outcomes two groups, make confidence intervals on. However, simply details.

So go back question. vaccine efficieny based numbers actually got infected trial. say vaccine 95% effective, pretty much means 95% likely get sick circumstances normally would gotten sick vaccine. 

It comes trials set up, say ""We'll give many people wait many months"". say ""We'll wait untill many people gotten sick"". also means need wait untill enough people actually catch virus meet endpoint, enough data. Therefore, everyone trial quarantining home get sick, trials would drag time. fact, trials going time amount infections bit low summer, really accelerated last months number infections rose countries. one reason huge number people trial begin with, make faster get enough infections properly analyze efficiency vaccine (the reason people have, better trial catching serious, rare side effects).

*) need split group exactly 50/50, could example split 1/3 gets placebo, 2/3s get real deal. make math little different people need cars get one think need one.

You live southern half US, you? 10% 80. 

If 10% 60+ dying would losing lot people. Ireland, lowest incidence rate Europe schools open along even remotely close decent number.
Guidelines vaccination coverage recommend least 90% population vaccined, ideally 95%.

50% definitely enough get transmission barrier protect can't vaccined (weak immune system, pregnant women, old folks, etc).

Also one major detail question asks want get vaccine, when.

Because guarantee lot French lads around willing get vaccined.

Just... now. 

""I mean know, vaccines take least decade developed one obviously rushed, dangerous take chances right now. I'll wait couple years least.""

That's screwed are. Perhaps reducing pie hole... /S isn‚Äôt never was. Reinfection extremely rare. Anyone says otherwise either irrational dooomer trying push antisocial agenda. side effects aren‚Äôt actually dangerous. suck. point stage 1 human clinical trial check immediate dangerous side effects harmful anyone trial would‚Äôve gotten shut down. depends die fills death certificate. Heart attacks strokes hard identify, season flu pneumonia would similar COVID. Unless local health depts require COVID test deaths, data remain muddy. Remember US Hospitals NEVER reached saturation point back spring saw first peak It‚Äôs easy tell. Look infection rate amongst minorities. They‚Äôre likely virus die it, interact closely within race, hence, spread amongst population. 

It‚Äôs compounding factor pverwhelmingly performing work isn‚Äôt WFH, well living larger households. anti-vax getting vaccine see coming from. crazy trusting thing.  ask time travelled medieval ages people didn‚Äôt believe viruses they‚Äôre invisible. call medieval cunt behind back whenever can. end dying alone, anyway. Nobody coming us go. nice able say goodbye care us. good look faces ones love, one last time go, go alone. still arguing asshole? He's leading circles refusing listen. point. vast majority people mild cases. got unlucky. I'm glad pulled it. ICU beds denied patients - like emergency surgeries, trauma patients. Even children's hospitals admit adult patients, thus diminishing bed counts. Well either liar idiot one it? took 2 seconds google Texas unemployment office 

‚ÄúIf work part time, may eligible continue receiving unemployment benefits long meet requirements, including looking full-time work‚Äù stopped July people. don‚Äôt know anyone making $275 week unemployment. context, rent area $1150. agreed, perceive household transmissions derived transmissions. original transmission coming school/shop/office secondary/derived one. right? force people wear mask 24/7 staying home, way. still cut primary transmissions. Oh reinfection crisis? sub sea ways. Trump curious too, hence response. Ok makes sense. Ah, right, thank you! sorry loss. Thinking family tough holidays. news comes vaccine lax people talk quarantine. NYC people still wearing masks distancing, time restaurants packed capacity people holding gatherings. Mask get it! one's dying experiencing anything severe vaccine. may totally wrong information heard pfizer vaccine around $300 per dose US. Possibly 3 4 Astazeneca Johnson&amp;Johnson come good news get approved soon!! Well said. wish could give gold friend. significantly 6 weeks lockdown Europe things go back normal. isolated island close 100% people coming country air gives far control managing things post lockdown willfully spout bullshit. Awesome think going greatest obstacle conquering pandemic. Convincing gullible conspiracy theorists anti-vaxx'ers effort takes EVERYONE, cant afford keep politicizing science. Well slowly getting worse still miles better exponentially getting worse. Isn‚Äôt Australia basically democratic? initially wanted say ""I hope find someone enjoy around"" that's probably ignorant me. believe humans want companionship know do. might like saying ""I really hope like tacos one day."" hate tacos. Probably stupid analogy that's brain works. I'll say hope everyone finds happiness, whatever looks like them. thing happen Christmas. vaccine 100%, undoubtedly vaccinated people still get COVID-19. 

We definitely know enough long term effects virus, though. Time tell. Curious: tested people covid-19? 

With many people right now, mass vaccination program bound inject someone who‚Äôs asymptomatic. never said person contagious minute infected. said it‚Äôs likely spouse kids become infected, you‚Äôre pretty likely get infected too, since won‚Äôt know infected contagious they‚Äôve likely infected well. Certainly Jan 21st. Wut? two assumptions cancel giving answer 42 agree, oversimplified exclusions previous comment. verified accounted number comorbidities, able verify looked like people multiple comorbidities. 

I want gloom doom - holy shit - vaccine going solve lot problems, think everyone needs cognizant reality small number vaccinated people going get protection saves lives. Can't wait go SCUBA diving without mask! musttttt DOOOOOOOOM day got reminder bot someone Colorado making case I've seen percentage people state would already infected time, explanation somewhat similar saying except different point Curve

It would probably worthwhile take look number reported deaths, dividing 0.6% theoretically pretty close estimate saying number cases would result that. perfect system would come pretty close  Hygiene include wearing mask, think that's ""just semantics""? businesses free sexually harass public reason individuals allowed either. lol.

OK, government regulations private businesses declared posts ago - seem Going nude beach know people nude sexual harassment. know they'll nude thus consent viewing nudity go.

I say nude beach. said public beach, designated purpose. they're mall, whoever owns mall.

But fine public twisting ass backwards trying come retarded inconsistencies agree with. lol.

Not all. led path declaring anyone without clothes unquestioningly sexual harassing people, even context place that's culturally acceptable, fine public toplessness, even areas that's culturally unacceptable. backed positions extreme authoritarianism extreme libertarianism performing mental gymnastics trying reconcile two! regions covid max capacity . Plus nurses going quit risking lives community taking seriously.

That, deserve support getting vaccinated first least could do. community learned lesson past surge.

Sadly likely cases explode blow past capacity yet again. NFL doesn‚Äôt give fuck anything money.   There's government vaccines make them. subsidise buy them. hell talking about?

A hundred bucks shot US cover everyone. doubt majority Washington DC alone would able get shot opposed getting shot, given black populace low incomes. homelessness, crime etc absurd capitol city. Again, objectively untrue. Severe cases outliers rare. Right. can‚Äôt seem find info whatsoever us recovered. I‚Äôm betting get second infection say otherwise. I‚Äôve heard conflicting things that.
So knows point 31 30 severe cases within control group. looking ratio severe cases within treatment group. zero. control group 30 severe cases.

This significant. know full well people say going read scientific journals anyway, could comprehend results. There's nothing fortunate losing relationships people selfish. watched UK US versions Utopia past couple weeks... terrified GOT IT. bad totally misread cares act families first act? thought cares act stimulus people can‚Äôt figure disclaimer it‚Äôs ancedote doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôll bad time, maybe need reevaluate decision making following random human reddit

For everyone else, it‚Äôs useful planning prepare vaccination. Informed consent important, knowing may bit annoying day important think anyone goes much effort screw patients.

7 years working court system. think means nothing. obviously wasn‚Äôt point. point won‚Äôt required. follow CDC guidelines wearing mask, sanitizing hands, staying 6 ft apart. mean still declined travel see family?

Unfortunately, pandemic ""outside"" goes 3 years passes time.

It won't. Check latest stories vaccines. touch advice, try drop '/s' next time, then. always thought bad guys post-apocalyptic shows far exaggerated. Like surely, people would cooperative see advantage rather trying kill/rape every person met.

But no, turns Hollywood human beings pegged correctly entire time. eat horse? personally see could play tomorrow literally every day they're positive tests, play tomorrow decide who's high risk contact team? Dude it‚Äôs fucking corruption, brutally honest, couldn‚Äôt give fuck ‚Äúcorruption‚Äù conflicting interests haven‚Äôt seen Aunt Uncle nearly year pandemic.

Irrelevant I'm claiming Pfizer ""did research,"" I'm pointing one seems know *what* partner did, exactly. Yet somehow Germans constantly crying comment sections ""really"" BioNTech vaccine.

And yeah, website makes clear collaboration continuation previous work two companies done far back 2018, focused candidates BioNTech already started collaboration Pfizer builds 2018 agreement jointly develop mRNA-based influenza vaccine. aims rapidly advance multiple COVID-19 vaccine candidates human clinical testing based BioNTech‚Äôs proprietary mRNA vaccine platforms, objective ensuring rapid worldwide access vaccine, approved. collaboration **leverage Pfizer‚Äôs broad expertise vaccine research development, regulatory capabilities, global manufacturing distribution network.** consider fair fire someone based imagination? strange living rural area. coworkers think I'm weird walk across street pick lunch instead driving. concept entirely alien them. Suffice say every last one obese. first doctor trying make money. Period. Lying sack shit.

Glad people don't. state went hard T. doubt vote Rona Desantis. guarantee people choose wear masks long time this. think everyone comfortable public without ludicrous makes sense. Wisconsin, we've 390,000 positive cases. 8x multiplier means 50% population it.

Helps explain why, state 5.8M people uncontrolled spread, 7 day rolling average new cases started drop significantly (and couple weeks) despite changes policy behavior. like thousands died this. 

I wish people like me, current state...

Number one, PROPER hygiene!!!, rest cOmEs fIrST

Yes, yes does...blood thicker water...unless family fucked, case run hell report, report... put overdrive still, immune system case would already readily available antibodies neutralize vaccine anyways. Say previously infected, based saying would basically imply could get 2nd infection, time much worse one. 

I realize said family got infected included there. perhaps might need vaccine reasons stated. I'm medical professional, researcher would listen would say informed. Obviously crave attention. Non-anonymous social media good fostering unhealthy behavior. Long term side effects remote possibility. overwhelming majority adverse effects vaccines short term ones occur shortly vaccine administered. worry much it. suggesting bring covid covid unit... and... what? infect covid patients even more? Thats works. evidence stopped second wave taking widely predicted here? Getting Covid doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs high risk you‚Äôll die it, especially you‚Äôre young healthy. Stop alarmist. know obviously Covid worse seasonal flu it‚Äôs plague. work small, independent grocery store do. close 2 hours mid day stock shift change. split three teams teams never cross reduce number people potentially exposed positive case. seen decline sales this, drastic hurting badly. customers said best stocked, safest grocery store area! Vaccine distribution go ""badly"" wrong - I'm pointing issues likely slow down. 

You think issues arise create impossible challenges professionals save bunch doses happen all?

Dry ice going critical many stages rollout. said, work frozen food industry worked logistics end, well food science end. regularly expedite food using dry ice, receive shipments reagents food using dry ice. matter what's printed outside box, matter extra care provided toward handling - 5% shipments arrive destination ruined.

You might argue different, entirely. Shit happens, they're going run dedicated distribution tens millions doses. point deep refrigeration going new challenge lot people - expect least single-digit % failure. 

***

You misunderstood meant ""sense normalcy"" - mean we're probably going endemic outbreak territory November, rather Pandemic. definitely imply herd immunity, vulnerable (i.e. immune) still infected, rate happening lower now. Herd immunity vulnerable truly immune due low infection prevalence definitely going occur 50 60% population immune. 

Do think 50 60% population immune November?


***

As last point, disagree hospitalizations deaths plummet, assuming elderly will:

 - Actually get vaccine (what % elderly vaccinated March? think going even close 20%?)
 - receive adequate protection vaccine. demographics Moderna vaccine cover 65+ well, entire group clusterfart number comorbidities conditions might fully represented trial. 

Due vast number health factors among elderly, one's harder predict, vaccine distributed across elderly going massive step toward ending thing, think mean significant number individuals still suffer die this. 


Again - **don't get wrong - end near** - think public policy makers even public health advice expedite return normal. think vulnerable us ""in clear"" now. know progress, know I'm capable time too. I've lost 100 lbs gained back, trying lose again. came easier first time. year, lost 17 lbs May, pretty much stagnant since. Trying get back working. would check human resources department, they'll pay without taking test see reason take one. getting two weeks pay dependent positive test would much wait line whatever testing Yep, current surge fools decided party üëª Halloween. ever happened ‚Äúit‚Äôs safety it‚Äôs around you‚Äù.

An army base vid could take whole town. Spoiler: antivax. You‚Äôre using logic antivaxxers use avoid getting vaccines. Ah yes, make sure follow Big Brother's ""rules"". wearing mask outdoors family members kids playdate ""breaking rules""?? know nothing situation, everyone generalizing. jeez knowing fauci advising lately bet deciding keep schools open difficult necessary. Instead reading Grundian Sun, think instead joing masses?

If support food industry, collapses. many 10s thousands jobs lost? Empty buildings? Taxes lost? supply chain break down?

Are going support raising taxes help pay millions millions suddenly benefits? think so.

If let kids go back school Uni, what's impact them? fair lose year education they'll never get back? They'll behind year whole life moving forward. impacts ability get job leave Uni. want one early possible build career.

I'm sick UK population. Always quick blame government without thinking impact acting. US built 3 5 warships day depending type warships counting (if decide include submarines, amphibious craft, patrol boats, etc... higher number). Agreed. nice place - way many people.  reviewing data then. side note I've heard companies health insurance giving people discount earn certain number points. would get points things like getting flu shot going physical getting blood pressure read health fair. sort thing think across board health insurance. One big issues pandemic deferred maintenance lack better term people stopped going physicals stop getting checked minor ailments last 5 10 years yearly maintenance, anyone needed prescriptions would already qualified could phoned get instead examined throughout year putting important exams I‚Äôd think 6 months closer end point ‚Äústart‚Äù. First priority 20 million healthcare workers next month. 

After we‚Äôll vaccinating tens millions people month, prioritizing finalized now.  hopefully 100+ million end March. Grames' original post, account @loveiskind05

The irony. Biden vaccine already looking great! deaths. hospitalizations. Wisconsin, I'm from, persons age 40 account 50%+ cases, fewer 5% hospitalizations.

Persons 80 account 50%+ hospitalizations, 5% cases. I‚Äôm ok that? Absolutely! I‚Äôm drilling parents‚Äô heads. time careful ways. 

At hospital, four rooms classic emergency cases, severe car accidents, burns, etc. ER visits handled outside tent. rest ER rooms inside Covid patients waiting room upstairs. So, nasty accident, you‚Äôll ER people suffering Covid bad enough must admitted. 

Despite reality, many people live continue assert hospitals ‚Äòempty‚Äô. There‚Äôs way change minds, becoming significantly ill Covid, case need admitted, they‚Äôll take room ER wait. Many swedes don‚Äôt really care deaths infections longer doesn‚Äôt really affect us except unfortunately belong risk groups. least freedom semi-normal lives compared countries draconian measures. Given size reaction post, seemed little excessive opinion.

Yes say stand it. experience life, us adult children experience plus children. lot variety experience yours. fact.

So, opinion, generation would better current 20/30-something generation dealing pandemic. obviously opinion can't change time. ""had harder"". feel issues dealt generation would better prepared us. opinion.

Relax, I'm attacking generation. actually love generation better mine number ways, like wanting care protect environment. generation, general, done horribly area. cares, really? Hey clear real quick Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs suspicious, 11 vaccine group. huge variability genetic composition based ethnicity factors could result unknown complications, seems. I‚Äôm anti vaxxer seem right testing hasn‚Äôt thorough? There‚Äôs way observe long term effects. guy trying herd immunity approach, even though country really full restrictions like everywhere else? employer able mandate something union agreements problem vaccine.

We know happens tens thousands people test positive virus. doubt there's anything even remotely like tens thousands who've vaccinated, silent 2020. Volunteers families would posting online place.


But people want afraid vaccine that's development 10 months tested people 8.5 months virus that's running wild U.S. 10 months killed quarter million, guess that's feel. Fewer deaths? yeah, sure. 

Less transmission? How? outbreaks care homes, outbreaks mostly small here. Workers wearing masks, residents getting tested often fast tests PCR tests people exactly running around infecting world. hurt, it‚Äôs good know contribution science help save hundreds thousands, possibly millions beginning, whatever available, lucky get either.

But seems possible young healthy people priority may able sort flu vaccines work now; people take whatever's available, choices. Please careful sharing anecdotes. may unintentionally dissuade people taking vaccine it‚Äôs available put others danger see merely projecting said people change minds come reddit. I'm sincerely sorry seem upset trying point discussion tactics ineffective! hope fun trolling attempts elsewhere! 15,000 people got vaccine (half 30,000). them, 11 got infected. Actually, would kinda suck.

75% would effective enough everyone would get shot effective enough end desire better vaccine. Unfortunately, everyone getting shot would significantly complicate future vaccine research (still possible, much slower testing phases). It‚Äôs looking likely season probably won‚Äôt able finish. level covid spread go roof, leagues rosters become unmanageable. people see social media preaching exactly people want hear. Reality situation whats nose, lots nurses care world. That‚Äôs got cover TIME 2020. Health care workers care *ALL* us, ranging everything right still got sick even mid-hug like still deny Covid. definitely deserve getting vaccine first. think Wendover Productions YouTube video logistics potential vaccine, perhaps six months ago. interesting imagine would look like

You mentioned government though least one vaccines using US government distribution oh, remember one many estimates infection count US might much 8x reported, puts infected numbers much higher  know read article... 

What state we're openly clamor corruption. 

Corruption nothing efficacy vaccine bud. actually lot intelligent people US *are* taking seriously. reason even worse.

The assholes taking seriously annoy us, too, we're sacrificing be, dickheads making locked really need be. However, follow thanksgiving church service Sunday. 

Murikkka!! think issue needs addressed.
 
 
 
Personally, getting vaccine early isn‚Äôt issue me. back head though, wonder somebody risk due preventable diseases caused obesity higher vaccine priority am. 
 
I tend take good care myself, eat well, exercise, etc.
 
 
Why somebody diet induced diabetes, hypertension, high-cholesterol, heart disease, asthma caused overweight considered higher priority me?
 
 
Obesity huge problem major societal implications. point need honest address such. 21-22 lbs loss huge though! Keep going, potentially adding years life time friends family go, gaining ability physically related things. stop! airconditioned space, amount social distancing help you. Yes, hard almost completely alone 6 months. skipping event, that's point post...I understand necessary. still hard. hardest thing I've ever done easy. Cuomo moron two-face politician one thing certain group follows rhetoric, Cuomo total 180 degrees. 
Example 3% positivity rate 2000 hospitalization ‚Äútreshold‚Äù start shutting counties again.
That said back July. Now, horrendous european outbreak, still following idiotic strategy going microcluater strategy. 
MANY people dont live work zipcode. that‚Äôs Cuomo‚Äôs strategy. 

For instance, right parents live 20ft away hotspot Cuomo painted yellow zone. Yellow zone means ‚Äúalert‚Äù indoor dining reduced. parents town overflooded people coming in. So, guess what? town spiking BAD positivity double yellow zone town. everything business usual. 
Some zipcodes 10% positivity rate Cuomo doesnt anything. Oh, shit. see alive, okay? Like, mentally well? I'm sorry happened youm close airports

Ok, good luck getting travel nurses service technicians engineers.

Non essential travel absolutely. Shutting airports however would cause country crash down. Well see would change. placebo group still enough people infected get statistically significant sample population, what's problem?   reading details swine flu vaccine. major shitshow beginning. isn't. Reviewing yes. approving 2-3 weeks now? rolling reviews vaccine manufacturers submitted EUA, ready go. states US replication number 1 1.2. Even getting 20% vaccinated would enough significantly slow spread people also keep masks social distancing. 

Of course think actually happen. cases start going people get overconfident stop following rules end right back started. issue forfeit neither team gets game check. punished team's players. People really understand statistical significance is. Oh, realize AC space. mitigation efforts take better *nothing*. higher risk you, therefore get first. End discussion. 

We argue day causes obesity range simply lazy slob way living food desert access fresh food. comes distribution life saving vaccine considering someone's perceived personal failure make healthy choices. I'm considered obese according BMI &amp; exercise daily eat strict diet full veggies rarely, ever, snack. wife hand snacks day, never exercises, eats fast food petite be.

Data improving receiving it. initial studies interim, infections placebo groups data got better. data verifiable published - think would get away lying exactly? around SC, based reports, really crowds Black Friday anyways.. almost everyone Thanksgiving family Yeah that‚Äôs plan Best wishes Moderna Phase 3 trial due complete year Didn‚Äôt say that. always better prepare rough day fine get time go regular day bad reaction, particularly friends positions safety others could impaired don‚Äôt take right precautions Also used treat cancer. train bodies immune system attack cancerous cells. I'm nice d00mers anymore talking numbers.

Your numbers observed case-fatality ratio. numbers wrote best estimate IFR across covid cases, whether officially confirmed (by test) not. get tested capacity. Driving I-405 yesterday, plastered giant letters across pedestrian bridge ""COVID-19 VACCINE DEVELOPERS ZERO LIABILITY."" live Washington State. can't fathom treated places like Florida people ""don't believe nasks.""

We going uphill battle get people take vaccines ya'll. don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs working kids tons children cyber school. make sweeping comment doesn‚Äôt work incorrect. fact working well SD may consider keeping hybrid model. everyone quit jobs bunch people go 400-person party? That's fucked He‚Äôs pulling number ass think urban areas likely buy vaccines, honestly afford I'd look moving area takes clear anti-vaxx stance. vaccine immunity, protection like mask, works lots people LOL!! depressing. says ‚Äúwork‚Äù would safe 4 minutes. I'm picturing alternate reality WWII still happens, Pearl Harbor, US lets Japan hammer away, island hopping, even attacking west coast, hammering away civilian military targets, Europe gets absolutely decimated hope recovery Nazis. US never gets involved war.

FDR spends 4 years denying war anything scared hundreds thousands dying ""is is"". war expert goes TV talk bad war actually is, morons argue he's partisan hack.

But 1942 FDR announces ""Operation Nuke Speed"" instead fighting war building Nukes, focuses nukes. 

Then nukes come bombs Nagasaki Hiroshima Berlin. war taken toll millions lives, nukes slow war, Japan Germany gotten powerful end 1947, war civilian casualties trump actual WWII.

Anyway - well Trump handled pandemic. mean fortunately, right? Oh boy, correlates serverity, rate infection.

Don't play mistakes made down.

You know, humanity suddenly acting unified, determined entity, would even possible completely eradicate virus 

But that's humans are. Especially west. use ‚Äúmaximizing days quality life saved‚Äù criteria would interesting see result. expect would younger people health issues first elderly people last. know what. even care point. family going take vaccine. We'll fine. anti-masker/anti-vaxxers catch Covid die care. year really taken toll empathy people. Fortunately, nurses I've worked recognize despite *overrun* COVID...it also typical situation. 1/3 admissions COVID ""like flu."" ~10 deaths 4 weeks COVID ICU average 5 deaths *year* ICU causes ""like flu."" 

We've fortunate overrun, especially limited healthcare here, listening rundown ""how Mr. So-&amp;-so do?"" ""He make it."" ""Did find rehab Mr Such-&amp;-such?"" ""He downturn, we're waiting wife get here, expect make night."" ...it's heartbreaking &amp; that's small scale, can't imagine impacted areas going through. someone explain need emergency clearance? would immediately cleared? mean, shouldn‚Äôt diabetic 80 year old get 21 year old cashier Target? add, need enough people total study get away likely hood randomly choose people getting. Sure there's always technically chance, low move trials. whole situation reminds Walmart episode South Park everyone agrees shop end arguing person there. welcome ass! comparing vaccine development novel virus already established vaccines. trying formulate vaccines viruses, many failed candidates effective ones. fully aware vaccine thoroughly tested approved likely high efficacy...My skepticism simultaneous production equally effective vaccines.   LIGHT FLAMES one? No. testing hasn‚Äôt implemented long enough study this. BLM riots ""virus free"" assume? doubt said anything those. first non-trial shot take place within next 30 days. could soon Dec 10th U.S. iphone is. activated phone CA. Ah yes, 10 thousands tests course 3 months. like vaccine usually take 8-10 years develop anything. Absolutely private property owner/manager/agent authority require customers employees wear masks. someone refuses follow literally rule have, kick refuse trespassing. see way many videos people arguing dummies. refuse put mask building, must leave immediately. refuse, trespassing arrested. There's discussion [John's data ""most affected countries,"" including US. 99 million... would death rate 0.003030303030303 assuming 300,000 deaths year end. silver lining. filled envy live any? Work any? Interact any?

A 63-year old cancer survivor went bar got infected, passing works girlfriend's group home caused multiple adults disabilities die. went felt justified enough wanted drink girls.

This one person issue, societal. Sources assertion cases come spontaneously families? Agreed. 

Going back point. data regarding vaccine later state?  appears don't. Without data state can't say certainty happen.  make educated guesses based know, expectations.  reasonable. know sure measured. idk I've heard hospitals Minneapolis Dakotas capacity. definitely ""hypothetical"" problem. real That‚Äôs concern trolling lol. I‚Äôm going bother engaging anymore clearly hate anyone questions new normal narrative. irony hype arrival vaccine fact 40,000,000 doses 336,000,000 residents USA begin with. bet even enough give front line workers one dose let alone two. taking 1.5% 9.5% fatality data from?

CDC says, best estimate IFR is:

0-19 years: 0.00003 (= 0.003%)

20-49 years: 0.0002 (= 0.02%)

50-69 years: 0.005 (=0.5%)

70+ years: 0.054 also know European country (Hungary) estimated 1.5 million overall past infected people, number dead 4600. 0.3% IFR across ages, seems line CDC numbers.  recommend shopping huge crowds indoors, pretty well known point spreading family members inside home cases come from. wiki: everything life question risk vs reward. supposed issue Pandemix vaccine rare would never pick approved rolled millions. (There still debate even caused issue rare, never established placebo controlled trial)

Most people considered vaccination much higher chance suffering severe outcomes Covid 1 100,000 chance (or even less) vaccine causing issue. 

By time vaccine planned rolled younger healthy people able much confident risk profile comes extremely rare events. 

All things risk, nothing also risk time risk pretty significant people exception maybe young children (though growing without parents grand parents real risk too). they‚Äôre living pandemic leave work like rest us. Can‚Äôt go get massage end week, can‚Äôt go grab drinks friends, etc. vaccines even tested bed-ridden geriatrics? 

Considering administration blatantly allowed elderly die virus, don‚Äôt trust vaccine elderly. It‚Äôs another step getting die defund Social Security Medicare. So.. americans? That's point control group though. think getting it, similar affects lifestyle.

I would also argue possible someone thinks got vaccine, would take risks could lower chance getting it. Right. 

And process same. body doesn‚Äôt keep antibodies around long period time. 

We‚Äôd literally nothing antibodies. 

Antibodies go away, whether vaccine natural infection. don‚Äôt think much difference way body responds antibodies vs natural infection. 

The likely outcome Covid becomes like coronviruses cause cold everyone infected either natural infection vaccine. 

If everyone got vaccinated once, perhaps would different virus would eradicated. isn‚Äôt possibility. long Long! ? worry, could make mandatory, ""i got freedumbs"" crowd stockpiling toilet paper ammo again. Thank geez everyone seems forget always assumed airborne, like every respiratory virus. people working towards is, first all, method detecting qualitatively ie whether present indoor area. That's well good, quite good actually stop think it. indoor space, say restaurant, tries reduce chances transmission premises comparing present-before absent-afterwards shows whether efforts successful. 

Then, least semi-quantitative method devised even useful. If, instance, modifications result *decrease* viral concentration evidence right track. especially useful found case location location, becomes part reasonable recommendations. If. hand, changes result small decrease decrease case similar places efforts bent towards productive means. 

If semi-quantitative method shows certain place consistently high viral count sign place put list places totally close. examples go on. point pathogen airborne, respiratory viruses are, end story. many, many things done reduce transmission many, many sensible precautions take. hmmm GOTTA LOT PROBLEMS PEOPLE!!!!! right, keep mind real-life outliers represented much vaccine:

- Obese/morbidly obese
- People number underlying issues disqualified participating
- Children. 

Now - results study make confident saying first two subsets, barring major immunological conditions, vaccine likely mean get infected, symptoms mild quick. last subset, children already quite resilient disease, finish tiered trials 18+ 16-18, 14-16, etc, I'm willing bet it'll better protection what's offered healthy adults current study. decade since I've church idea recurring auto-deduct tithe seems funny mild long-COVID syndromes great preliminary data. works cancer patients colossal douche. Masks aren‚Äôt 100% are. literally spamming question asked before. So, pathetic, youre also either moron liar. I‚Äôm hopeful vaccines work. sub. Business owners desperate seen murderers. example 44% adults NYC work restaurant industry, see Cuomo hesitant close restaurants. went dentist appointment back in...sept think. Things pretty low PA time installed vacuum things patients face spray stuff got sucked right away. Everybody masks face shields googles that. seemed pretty safe especially lower case count time. I'd probably skip appointment coming though.  really really hope writes book day.  I'd like tell 2020- suspect he's type that.  something covers career history US infectious disease response involved in. Good thing I‚Äôm actually concern trolling! There's tons sub then.

Edit: ton mean tons people circle jerking anecdotes people may twice, claiming there's way immune, etc think unnecessarily paranoid.  Articles like frustrate me. What‚Äôs point? vast majority people know work buildings don‚Äôt own, control filter used HVAC system. Often, guy top one contact landlord there‚Äôs great distance person staff. fact, many buildings don‚Äôt even windows opened. 

My point people US work building poor ventilation little/no control HVAC. Many can‚Äôt open windows. articles like one really don‚Äôt give good alternatives, leaves people feeling even helpless afraid. leads pandemic fatigue, fuels surges. 

Tldr: Since people don‚Äôt meaningful control ventilation workplace, articles like harm good strengthening existing feelings helplessness fear. anyone expecting sterilizing immunity? impression hoping something along lines flu vaccine. actual statistics? confidence intervals maybe? Would love see work actually government perpetuating hell. lockdown work first time. Lets try again? Enough. hard quantify general rule thumb since airborne stick around indoor spaces little ventilation? Redoing ventilation systems 100 million buildings practical. windows open middle winter, fast coming.

But certainly good idea theoretically. 99%+ people fine take rocket scientist guess relactively untested vaccine might worse side effects infection. Trump: virus fake. wear mask. fine gather crowds!

Scientists: uh better make vaccine quickly.

Vaccine made.

Trump loyalists: yay Trump saved us virus!

*sad scientist noises* suggesting Covid bad flu?

^/s Troubled yet allow idiots like Jason Kenny fuck curb rampant spread. Coworker mine graduated college bachelors criminal justice. going school nursing anything like coworkers experience, lot cheated lazy professors. know enough fail tests can't cheated keep grades high enough bad grades stuff can't cheat put passing grades. legit concerns side effects raising questions results voted??? hahahaha

never said anything negative vaccines really don‚Äôt give fuck anyone warp speed may worked Moderna pharma company. fucking don‚Äôt.

Moderna gave us incredibly effective vaccine end nightmare Operation Warp speed helped.

Fuck stupid aboutism, vaccine help us end hell in. don‚Äôt give shit may interests see aunt uncle grandmother  feel folks lose livelihoods another shutdown. 

There needs plan help get government assistance. 

A shutdown wrong keeping open. general public gets vaccine March, April (whenever is), one vaccine likely other? locations getting shipments constantly it'll end whatever available? trying lock people up, me. Fuck validation, one needs good reason one. I'm contact people risk, refuse that's you. think job risky quit. enough unemployed people nowadays job you.     
Oh yeah Lockdowns accomplish anything even horribly weak reason foundation reality.  would bet said time. Things work differently entire medical pharmaceutical world focused one thing willing burn money make happen. batch treats celebrities well modernas chief medical officer saying know whether stops transmission deployed basically says trials designed show whether Yes have. Take wild guess responsible researching producing. Moderna company pushed Trump

isn't part they've strong ties NIH now? Moderna seems like company Trump picked decide pump way take credit it, rather company genuine ties man. There's good Libertarian denial. 
Just go bury head sand 3 weeks please. Then, maybe concentrate personal liberties worry sewage spewing snakehole... ‚ÄúCould‚Äù Lol, understatement millennia? ""what aboutism"" fantastic way prevent taking reasonable outside look government's actions.  American Academy Pediatrics said dangerous place teacher faculty meeting. Yes, *exceedingly rare* confirm reinfection due constraints limitations surrounding confirmation... mean reinfection rare.

The keywords glossing '**appears be**' '**to date**'. means date appears rare, rare.

It *appears be* rare due issues confirmation. Would make sense simply donate money? feel like people going restaurants ""support local businesses"" nice, ultimately less effective giving money. Profits restaurants extremely slim, getting $10 takeout effective $1 donation so, plus run risk spreading COVID.

This probably hard/impossible friend, would seem like charity get socially difficult, however, never understood go-to response keeping restaurants afloat. prep food, support staff rent. Seems like easy keep restaurant industry afloat right stimulus plan.  got random rash legs first thought bugs bites. Nothing else unusual. worry? least America voted guy lied Chinese people shitty government?

It's even worth getting discussion think voting Biden laudable action us. Thanksgiving dinner, mobs shoppers stores day Thanksgiving.  

Not day Thanksgiving, mobs shoppers day well. work major department store. Black Friday sale going full week Thanksgiving, particular reason people wait day Thanksgiving shop. Plus online shopping thing. Still, in-store sales 9% last year's Black Friday. I'm sure easy get one people suspect safety issues vaccine. take one, want pfizer, company work deals them, plus Moderna company pushed Trump. Yes. coworkers literally case yesterday true necessarily mean unsafe. Unless fair number reputable scientists start coming advocate taking vaccine, think there's lot credence idea FDA/EMA would allow unsafe vaccine distributed. Whaaa? Explain. Please? loads pinned thread particular supposed factually informative. veiled sarcasm deadpan humour don‚Äôt help people looking actual information serious help advice. Got candy acid? Sounds tasty. choice, tho actually always free - contracts pay fee. pull part conversation, whether agree not. talking whether schools open not, think best acknowledge different factors play that's one them. always, always argue 2nd amendment, never been. intentionally refer Biontech vaccine. Credit credit‚Äôs due. Plenty ""regular folk"" get vaccinated winter state school since March cases still increasing exponentially. seem matter. 42 people one go? funeral, white house? vaccine developed faster tested long term effects. I've gotten literally every vaccination I'm supposed get. I'm going wait one. Maybe next summer, think going widely available then, I'll take people've system 6 months. law unintended consequences. ages since played remember. Plague inc probably overwrote memory game setup then, quite similar were. You‚Äôre forgetting like 3 doctors nurses per hospital cause rest withdrawal themselves. sure are!  think diminished returns would better way look it. do. yes plot one hand little unrealistic it‚Äôs still pretty damn inspiring. thought anyway. international arrival O'Hare? Great. it'll get diverted Milwaukee bad weather, get stuck customs, miss connection. Often hospitals wont take someone long term care facility individual DNR. die LTC. fair say BioNTech developed vaccine. 
its fair say one scientific work one mostly grunt work. 
its fair say pfizer interested still would made someone else. would tell someone like bank employee grocery store workers also keep working?

Whatever tell answer.  Whooooh...I'll never get point care get sick. I'm 50, history smoking (quit last year), pneumonia bronchitis many times. I'm quite seriously risk fatality. 

Yup...just stick out! point quick distribution vaccine concrete hope save thousands life really run time. Chicago... Brussels? like - Brussels Belgium? why? guess Vitamin issue nickel day investment virtually downside. know Vitamin deficiency pretty widespread problem anyway. I'd little worried could stir animosity, especially reported region way infection rate is. Like ""why state next us get vaccines us?"" kind thinking. Don‚Äôt know, seem wearing masks people make decisions worlds apart people like bartenders manual laborers. anti-Vaxxers make large population size US? Genuinely curious.. Covid vaccine that‚Äôs bringing crazy people woodwork.  Sadly enough stop current surge, Thanksgiving Surge, Christmas Surge New Year‚Äôs Eve Surge. yet. prefer lou's giordano's (which still good). masks social distancing actually enforced (they school) really much spread schools. live North Dakota, one worst states, amount spread happened school district negligible.

hard get school everything else. ‚ÄúBut deep inside, know people really like now, deeply disappointing.‚Äù

This thing. ever able fully trust someone finding they‚Äôd willing kill people don‚Äôt want postpone vacation?

I don‚Äôt know.

And can‚Äôt trust them, friends them?

That‚Äôs tough, man. answer least I'd say 30 comments pissed said normal May yesterday people wore masks, followed guidelines set CDC. problem lies equally government Centers Disease Control Prevention said funerals need reconsidered pandemic

not mention SCOTUS last week ruled ok church services. Excellent definitely well thought plan, thank you!
I wouldn‚Äôt thought glasses, wear glasses read yes, sounds like good sense me. Thanks again! number children die abuse neglect would otherwise identified school. person thought making good point beyond me. doubt delusional also incredibly bad thinking. virus produces mRNA modify cells replicate itself. it‚Äôs really playing God. It‚Äôs like nature preemptively body already prepared real virus appears.  mentioned previous comment, I‚Äôm actually happy healthcare workers going first. We‚Äôll see vaccine either kills permanently disables them, like poor guy Oxford trial. icon changed red blue? confirm. I've lost *lot* physical ability last 8 months previous 10 years, despite gone active employment computer programmer. New Prohibition. I'm talking browser game like 2008 so. steam game. maybe pandemic 1? Idk more. play board game lot though.

Oh wow looked up. 2007 came out. Nah, blue planes research phase. We're vaccine 100% complete distribution starting. 

If anything like though playing plague inc, sell everything environmental put everything lethality kill many people possible lose cure reached 100%. Sooooo, might wanna stay inside get jab. sure hope United careful handling vaccines Seems like anti-vaxxers don‚Äôt even believe covid real. vaccine another big pharma gambit. First thing would ask really think would want risking life health ? would honor memory? 

Then would put flowers grave take day remember him, later. don‚Äôt depend magnesium content food. soil become largely depleted content food guaranteed. Magnesium supplements cheap dirt patent encumbered proprietary, don‚Äôt see much reason avoid them. Go court house small vacation close family friends.

The occational article NYT someother media change perception long since planted deep minds public, everything China perceived wrong ideological level, nothing learned.

It's already appearent polarization US domestic politics, ""I care side did, WRONG, can't like them"" unprecedented. us can. kid one friend currently listed ""homeless"" new school, since move half brother family. kids mother pull together losing job last April. kid decided needed focus school, mom drunk mom. check friends every day. miss hanging out.

Like day day feel difference? anything, vaccines need frostbite-causing conditions lol Funny mention it. Italy terrible amount mysterious pneumonia last quarter 2019. found two cities covid wastewater December found samples covid antibodies September 2019. Two things may understand: viruses mutate become contagious, viruses necessarily originate first detected. European countries analyzing pneumonia samples like China SARS mean covid earlier.

Also, one yet come reason every single country around China done well considering asymptomatic nature virus. Vietnam, shares land border China, barely affected. Even clamp quickly, spreading silently December There's missed step:

1. Frontline 

2. High risk

3. High exposure &lt;-- profession comes play

4. Everyone else Another possibility children tend transmit less virus commonly asymptomatic. UK study 2‚Äì15-year-olds, 50% infected children developed Evidence gleaned national COVID-19 statistics also shortcomings. United States, example, asymptomatic infections still missed policies people develop symptoms tested.




So potentially bunch asymptomatic, infected kids, tested, infecting bunch adults. everyone thinks schools safe appears infections coming adults, since ""little Timmy never cold symptoms, him"".

Kids transmitting less, simply getting credit fewer transmissions since far less likely show symptoms. Who‚Äôs ‚Äúat risk?‚Äù course older people tend die younger people infected diseases large portion people hospitalized disease younger adults may even think lancet says went ~6 years recovery post-viral syndrome understand pretty well devastating effects major immune response be... aren‚Äôt even thinking aspect yet. Death isn‚Äôt negative outcome one experience. feel terrible ‚Äúlonghaulers‚Äù go hell crawled of. 

Our situation much worse think lot people realize. It‚Äôs abstract threat multiple fronts. Yes. Even clear May miracle, really want wedding time everyone else rushing theirs? I'm sure things booked advance, I'd surprised cause hitches. saying Bill Gates trying microchip us.

Saying shit like smart phone pocket whole time lol US bought them. US agreed pay almost $2B 100 million doses back July. couple weeks ago, Belgium apparently [not ordered Pfizer Except hundred posts legal subs asking owners switched get $4 $1 split amongst staff. somehow legal long doesn‚Äôt drop minimum wage.  intended convey something *would* work vacuum, make best course action. Like State-imposed national lock leaves doodie Bill Rights. It‚Äôs real, could give link want Going walk outside ‚Äúspreading disease.‚Äù It‚Äôs basic requirement health, extremely low risk spreading COVID unless you‚Äôre intentionally exposing yourself.

You exposed COVID walking around outside unless decide stand right next someone maskless extended period time. Even then, transmission risk outside 19 times lower due better air flow.

Going walk park dawn, probably won‚Äôt even see another human all, let alone wind smooshed them.

When go ambling, take mask pocket case something crazy happens need help someone broken leg something, don‚Äôt worry it. COVID doesn‚Äôt float miles looking unsuspecting random infect. did, you‚Äôd get even staying house. house isn‚Äôt air-tight.

It‚Äôs respiratory disease passed close contact others low air flow. factors avoided outside park, especially off-peak hours. Provide reliable sources then, verified links. Well, second wave, mostly control now. However there's also fact consider 3 weeks vaccine rolling point lockdowns less desperate strategy keep virus bay part coordinated effort keep people safe vaccine available en masse.  neighbors party 30-40 people shared deck. Long Beach, CA. anyone know LA county number call report gathering? anything even done? I'm pretty sure there's going wave anti-healthcare conspiracies people say doctors gave covid unnecessary procedures. Thank God plane crash, cause know, 2020 all. think injections are? almost thing real tiny cut... adequate stimulus would obvious answer. none passed (since March?) far difficult make decisions. Unfortunately one proposing amount stimulus get us point. also probably necessary shut long, depending mean somewhat. keep everything open keep going hospitality industry isn‚Äôt going utilize donations intended for? Sounds right. 

-17 years hospitality taught enough know answer question. would absolutely dump employees onto unemployment use money themselves. Nah, that's current tech that's refined past years. longer future tech.

I'm talking bleeding edge tech comes around changes thing again.

mrna vaccines revolutionarize medicine. I'm curious though, much people ""staying home quarantine"" could travel Thanksgiving. know lot people mindset (purely anecdotal, know).

Obviously, everything guess right now. see couple weeks. can‚Äôt say agree could, Did. way kids dont contribute community spread guess significant. dont buy conspiracy theories lying us know. guess wont really know much rear view mirror. sure seems inefficient manufacture ocean away, obliging air freight heavy quantities dry ice. just-in-time globalisation profits really payoff Pfizer, can‚Äôt make stuff US? ""other poor, rural states.""

""You know... Morons."" Gimmee dat gud stuff boiiieeeee U.S. this? stop pissy one second discuss article without crying. good thing Trump welcoming transition Well, lamenting United States can't implement government mandated nationwide ""lock down"" like CCP did. pesky rights liberties standing way. Yeah, people comparing timeline typical vaccine though typical situation amount funding attention would put anything else. Republican Things hardly going well Europe. Many actions take extensive planning put effect day 1. 1. never said otherwise. 
2. Lot schools say follow safety precautions shut multiple times due covid. like acknowledge know full extent virus long lasts. could definitely case, epidemiologists said, permanently us. could necessitate yearly vaccines preventative measures.  
My hope govt tries take preventative way though think that's odds need robust economy constant growth.  


needless emphasize, high hopes response. important article worth reading.

Also *Science Magazine* excellent journalism days! headline wrong. actually REDUCE hybrid learning:

""Students [can return already signed in-person meaning 190,000 children grades schools city reopening next week would eligible. 335,000 students total chosen in-person classes."" Fox news idiots clearly think China like East Germany 60s realize people China live normal lives internet social media. slowing spread care more, shouldn‚Äôt be. 

A 25yo 70yo going infected. vaccinate one them. vaccinate? assume (correctly) 25yo much better shot full recovery, vaccinate 70yo. improve chance people staying healthy. initiated personal attacks. answered kind called deflection...  Umm that‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying. Im

Normal spring USA prob what‚Äôs happening, makes sense multiple reasons believe experts  probably political opposition disease prevention. true relevant many deaths attributable factors nothing necessity... like Thanksgiving gatherings bother man, tons chinese apologists reddit. mix actual government astroturfing young chinese loyalists, heads pumped full propaganda, time.

All need see China Hong Kong know another ruthless dictatorship. Definitely. take couple months roll millions vaccines anyway. brother moved wedding celebration 2022 too, civil wedding early last year. answer earlier question u/LaContrarian

??? worth imo thing said tests? think everyone knows understands rich places get first much anger far point country asking give something temporarily sake fellow countrymen that's outlandish you. Like said, country founded sacrifice maintained well. fellow American, unwilling give, unlike uncountless generations us time called it. dont think Founding Fathers could imagined situation like wrote Bill Rights. California hit another milestone Sunday struggle unprecedented surge coronavirus cases, reporting COVID-19 patients state hospitals point statewide L.A.

Limited testing available, it‚Äôs way infections even test pushes CFR super high. easier way sewage testing- done various places (another places universities done quite well).  never coordinated proactive testing US.

We got place basically enough tests test people reactively.  outside schools sports leagues precious little proactive testing contact tracing everyone knew needed contain thing vaccines could ready. morals place Science. VIC starts taking people help boast numbers think curevac (inventor mRNA vaccinaction) biontech (inventor pfizer vaccine) got money german government got early orders?
Do think countries better time missed think vaccines early US government still said would magically disappear April? Everyone brain already fucking knew...for 9 months now. article china trying lie change origin virus. know trying imply it‚Äôs gov.

These numbers look absolutely bonkers me. Like, treatment severe deficit we're on, adds 14k week. 50k 3.5 times even that. husband get tested tomorrow colleague corona. long take get results he‚Äôs negative still get tested? suggesting virus safe? compromise.

Everyone goes school except teachers. teachers remote classroom via Zoom. people previously confirmed cases keeping law order school whole. takes care childcare situation keeps teachers safe.  make mandatory. stating give minority vote determine good EVERYONE? That's democracy works... Fauci saying keep schools open? course. would data credible? Asymptomatic covid? dense think government ‚Äúnot funding‚Äù American company front somehow completely divorces ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù contribution? government entire country, Pfizer American company largely employs Americans live America idea angle trying take lol. 

Not seem understand pharmaceutical R&amp;D works, US committed purchasing $1.95 billion worth doses (100 million) option purchasing additional 500 million, Pfizer would sink R&amp;D without assurance. Get literally nothing substance contribute half assed attempts trying sound smart. Spoiler alert: think really depends kid age many factors too.

March/April ish. exactly sure timeline bodies stated stored trucks. people haven‚Äôt buried, much less given funeral. isn‚Äôt true. COVID isn‚Äôt special. It‚Äôs virus. vaccines viruses. It‚Äôs corona virus. Again, seen type virus. 

The special unseen part exact strain SARS-CoV-2 getting body produce antibodies attach kill exact strain.

So yes, it‚Äôs Toyota building station wagon. first airplane roll freezer lol dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever heard. There‚Äôs chance dying pretty much everything. It‚Äôs called life say ‚Äòpregnant people‚Äô saying ‚Äòpregnant women‚Äô politically incorrect 2020 checked android phone looks normal. Idk üòù May ask, restrictions/safety guidelines, many outbreaks aware within school?

Edit: also question, understand checking temperatures stopping children running anything, right? running rule elementary school... I'm sure anything. fact adults likely get virus adults kids isnt influenza. So, yes, trust doctors deciding risky behavior unique pandemic looks like. trust science try amateur epidemiologists less. Science often goes people's ""gut"" feelings, that's need it. Eh basically extreme adverse side effects. vaccines tend give small effects relating virus they're helping build immunity to. trial-patients vaccine started dropping like flies one one unexplainably two years, would want know general population got it. clinical testing stage new vaccines last years, make sure things like happen. obviously special situation, they're fast tracking clinical testing, risk possibly seeing adverse side effects occurring long 9month(iirc) testing period Corona vaccines. Top Germany scientist says Covid came Italy Cuomo: Covid came Europe:  It'll better everybody does. June 2021 time vaccination completed general population current schedule (assuming two stage vaccine weeks reach peak effectiveness), makes sense. That's really handle this. remember start pandemic China got *shit on* Americans online failed contain virus yet 9 months later there's parts America huge numbers people can't even acknowledge virus exists.

In way I'm sort glad started China, least sequenced quickly shared world everything went absolute shit.  biontechs vaccine, idiots [Can‚Äôt set new records hospitals already  much want happen, it‚Äôs gonna stay way. I‚Äôm sorry world without rights isn‚Äôt gonna happen crazy new faction steals vaccine? lone operative goes rescue it? I've played get before... March peak hospitalizations mostly dozen states northeast along coasts. current peak fairly well distributed among 50 states. Stop overplaying numbers. They‚Äôre definitely near enough testing. don‚Äôt really understand ins outs myself. understood less mutations *possible* wanning immunity. can‚Äôt believe people voted comment, it‚Äôs like control viruses. Insufferable prick. BioNTech chosen GSK instead Pfizer, nobody would talking Pfizer all. humility would suit yourself. Let stupid spread reach other. WFH/Remote Tech Bros: Absolutely, let‚Äôs this.

Literally everyone else: Halp.  I‚Äôm teacher data shown driving spread. ya go. anecdotal claims, studies thousands kids. 

The fact schools open, things better people go more. Correlation causation.

Also sped teacher 11 years don‚Äôt see something wrong schools closed indefinitely, especially special needs- well, shit, don‚Äôt even know say you. recovered covid september currently I'm IgG positive (444 U/mL) IgM negative (0.3 U/mL).
Because denied job offer got result even though thought meant degree immunity.
Assuming IgG last least year unable get job company overreacting misinformed? Go ahead push timeline least month.

Hopefully nurses covid positive allowed work.  Savage  Couldn‚Äôt agree more. pray works everyone else best way tell report rubbish statistics. is, capable - goes competence. 

When early could easily tell curve fitting - led stopping reporting. 

It's possible small city technically within china 10x cases china. don‚Äôt visit family months. gave alt data look great. think going enter new era vaccine development research thanks companies like Moderna. know exactly much virus need cause infection, means need something compare against. Asking people control subjects vaccine living normal lives perfectly reasonable. Asking people exposed deadly virus get sick know exactly much expose vaccine candidates to, much.

On top that, know give enough virus someone, they'll infected despite already vaccine recovered. similar experiments monkeys, example. knowledge lot less useful knowing stops 94% ""wild"" infections people going day days. Dentist offices Vet offices hit hard well politicians? Lol.

My Facebook full families gathering defiance evil ""Lady Whitler"" says that's false. 

If need celebrity tell right thing, need reevaluate life. Guess test well monoclonal antibodies hold couple months didn‚Äôt spread misinformation I‚Äôm saying you‚Äôre unbearable, childish douchebag lol I‚Äôm clear terms. EUA US emergency use UK? think it‚Äôs good idea see friends socially distant setting, like walk park. low-risk activities like doesn‚Äôt contribute spread lot good mental health.

The average hospitalization stay coronavirus 14 days. So, 90,000 gone month, meaning system handle 70,000 minimize problem, can't add 70,000 90,000. neighbor's children eat classroom masks off. Would advise children eating masks off? Would want eat environment?

I think anyone can't say schools safe. Kids typically asymptomatic carriers.

I NY plan. Test students staff. negative, enter building. also going see fuck going happen hospitals 87 million people get infected month. Many straining 5 million known active infections. I'd say April, enough frontline workers elderly already vaccinated would know truly significant side effects.

So, I'll get one despite fact already covid weeks ago. Wow. didn‚Äôt realize vaccine skeptics secretly biotechnology/nanotechnology degrees makes qualified say stuff. Oh wait... Billions? hospital have¬†one physician every 50 patients **one nurse every 25**.¬†&lt;&lt;

So long nurse spent 5 mins one patient, she'll able answer call 2 hours. citizen countries I‚Äôd pretty pissed leadership too. Imagine thinking everyone waddling around bodybuilder thin layer fat.

The fallacy bodybuilder/over muscled example regards BMI people muscular, people fat BMI adequate metric use them. article talks long covid stay alive surfaces. Also download study  book that's still sacrifice. could stayed it, bunkered like rest us raised chances surviving. Instead went trial knowing could go live life higher risk catching covid ended dying early it. Whether gave virus irrelevant. two options chose one put great personal risk payoff whatever paid furthering research could save millions.

The attack rate percentage close contacts infectious person actually infected. Kinda half assed lockdown though already rampant. 

To point isolated island. China? went full lockdown route also managed get control. planning quarantining late 2022 2023 thinking straight. very, cavalier. thinking seeing sunlight least 365 days get vaccine.  Sometimes they're mutually exclusive. People frauds sell life selling medications / vaccines profit motive time. Scandinavian countries? suggest meant one world plain stupid.

To suggest Betsy DeVos, US Secretary Education, anyone world arguable stupid.

Here salient facts attempt comprehend:

DeVos sets education policy

Fauci not

If DeVos believes elementary school-aged children spread COVID Fauci believes might (even though publicly stated that), person's opinion that's relevant discussion sending children back elementary school **DeVos'**. Poor man. must frustrated. focus whoever funding them. Call Covid US already purchased vaccines Pfizer Moderna covers costs. based allocation. Even costed money part still need allocation based system least get certain groups scattered across America would delay getting back normal rich got get first. Sorry topic inappropriate, cannot deal people STILL think defeat covid positive psychology. 

A quarter million Americans dead, go away 'keeping calm.' wrong people? prediction could completely wrong imma make anyways not. 

Once vaccine starts becoming prevalent majority population, estimate there‚Äôs going something similar ‚Äúsoldiers returning WW2‚Äù effect dating scene picks again, resulting spike STDs. 

And real kicker majority people reddit aren‚Äôt going know phenomenon makes national news us website perpetually single guys unsuccessful women. say want anti vaxxers getting late. means get second wave. staffed bed != someone knowledge run ventilator, etc. etc. staff fungible. 

Without right human capacity, hospital bed place die. Congratulations! little weight gain quitting smoking expected! list possible doctors likewise looking forward future needs.

I‚Äôm grateful wife‚Äôs hospital zero tolerance policy masking, wish patients took seriously community. Somebody update pic superheroes bowing hospital staff replace logos vaccine makers. They're real heroes now. Every state plan. It'll generally same, might small differences. eligible, exactly, say late January could slightly different say Arizona New Mexico. Great article! Thanks sharing! Got it, thanks! must‚Äôve read wrong. high weed affect covid test all? data? Okay:

[Dr. Anthony Fauci, One month consulting firm who, among things, helps businesses understand broader landscape preparation article talking Models predict US requiring keep taking precautions (Admittedly, simulations probably little obsolete run May 2020). 

[Children alone likely vaccine 2022, make 22.6% US population much forecasting done Fauci epidemiologists economists fully take consideration potential slowdowns happen due distribution problems. 

Also - response another comment - greatly overestimate perfect cold distribution system is. number people touch product given part supply chain huge, MANY points failure. nice believe incredible care taken distribute vaccines, realistic - going people let product sit coolers full dry ice sun while, making sublimation dry ice happen rapidly. going punctured coolers (again, rapid sublimation). going vehicle breakdowns. going incompetent drivers workers load/unload trucks. 

This deal food time, going expect - I'd interested knowing **using actual data since important you** pharmaceutical refrigerated supply chain would better. 

I'm deleting anything. said nothing wrong, request, brought data (something bring either - shot misleading tidbit herd immunity prepended ""by definition."" swear someone made bot repeat ""doomsday 2 weeks"" comments every thread.

There's way real human would repeat 9 months self awareness. /u/shadowpsi /u/entaroadun

Not bad! 7 day moving average 1642 November 25th. Obviously thanksgiving holiday weekend lowering reporting rate that.  LOVED overnight oats! definitely something need get back into, especially peanut butter almond milk strawberry yogurt mmm ü§§ structural advantages Moderna vaccine does, think fluff numbers.

The Pfizer / BioNtech vaccine chemical equivalent needy diva. Specialized lab freezers needed, constant temperature monitoring removing injection, etc. Moderna vaccine challenges.

Assuming availability, anyone would choose Moderna vaccine logistics &amp; inventory management perspective. November: famous fictional breathing complication time dies Covid. I'm terrified december going bring. hope rest family safe able cope That‚Äôs like popping car tires giving ride work. rIgHtS No.

It means 30% country would exposed sarscov2 point 2020, combined vaccines measures substantially less spread 2021.

Read article. comes Swedish Health agency would put much weight it. consistently wrong.

Going track record, likely wrong right, giving us estimate peak january february. necessarily, science articles I‚Äôm reading brought everybody needs get vaccinated natural immunity help big way. 
The problem virus virus it‚Äôs people puts hospitals. older folks risk people get vaccinated problem hospitals overwhelmed nonexistent start treat thing like common cold ( lockdowns). 
It never possible get 100% population inoculated possible get rid virus completely least healthcare system function that‚Äôs what‚Äôs really important funny mom nurse could deal nasty body fluids suctioning thing got too. Knowingly exposing people potentially deadly disease considered many morally questionable.
There however class trials - human challenge trials.
More info following Radiolab actually early Thanksgiving Day casualties. showing initial symptoms. Give one week start feeling really bad, yet one week get ill need hospitalization survive, tsunami patients start arriving around Dec. 12th. Oh dare say you‚Äôll find news soon enough. Seriously, UK. Well done making can‚Äôt get vaccinated second class citizens. think interesting unraveling wide range symptoms covid also effects people differently.

It seems block virus going lower respiratory tract, upper.

Anyone knows truth? Please tell. back little find interview.  Shame actual Christmas, least UK, likely result significant amounts new cases restrictions temporarily relaxed people decide can't wait months spend extended time families. I'm huge NFL fan year participate fantasy barely watched full game. hard enjoy watching football knowing 1. much testing resources going towards repeat testing athletes shortage supplies 2. long term damage men could face! coronavirus anxiety increased lot found Bills TE myocarditis. NZ lockdown quick enough probably wasn‚Äôt, Australia went quite bit imagine they‚Äôre going go recession soon

It‚Äôs money lives vs lives

In Uk NHS publicly funded == less funding nhs == less resources plus public sectors students loans also quite worried first research it. Vaccines typically take 5-10 years, majority time applying re-applying funding. Waiting volunteers, waiting funding etc. Covid vaccine quick unlimited funding willing volunteers. vaccines could quick resources. rushed sense safety compromised, paperwork rushed.

Additionally, main fear human trials gone long enough long term effects. Well 10 year long vaccines, human trials happen end anyway! basically, safety compromised all. current vaccines approved yet, believe looking like be. approved, safe vaccine available us.

Also worth noting, vaccines long term effects. also \*typically\* dangerous effects.

Edit: asking, here's excellent thread twitter explains really well: guess no-one ever heard gargle test xD liver transplant actually. selection process includes psychiatric evaluation figure high person's risk relapse rejection problems arise discontinuing anti-rejection meds. Sometimes person sober six months. Depending individual alcoholic person could prioritized non-alcoholic. I've never heard heard immunity before, anyone else heard it? [It's shit individuals, good metric important remember efficacy narrowly defined relates risk reduction clinical trial vaccine compared placebo control group. Assuming study well blinded, there's reason suspect bias would impact results. term vaccine companies FDA use discussing data.

Effectiveness subtly different relates real world usage. fluctuate depending region, population density, many people vaccinated, social distancing, etc. difficult estimate vaccine released high efficacy provide high effectiveness. said people want vaccine, believe science? definitely believe science, believe trust government. don‚Äôt wear lask, lad nurses tik tok dances Cheap land grab. Long covid? Love live dangerously dying paper cut we've destroyed health care system. believe counting presumptive cases CDC estimates 4x 8x higher confirmed case counts NY thought vaccine ""beat"". Little know. vaccine placebo group like testing new parachutes purposely giving one group new parachute group dummy parachutes. need see happens people receive fake parachutes ?

I can‚Äôt really grasp placebo group needed Whenever Russian Chinese vaccines get posted about, inevitably comment section filled people saying would never take vaccine coming them.

Not disagree sentiments that‚Äôs case, quite frankly, everyone lives West feelings vaccines moot point.

The harsh reality one likes wants bring Russian Chinese vaccines going poor countries. fact, 80% poor countries‚Äô supplies Coronavirus vaccines Russian Chinese. unfortunately ones dealing consequences, any, come that.

But knows? Independent review boards may certify efficacy safety Russian Chinese vaccines; case they‚Äôll third world huge favor. vaccines work, better world one year today beyond ‚ÄúIf look per-capita hospitalizations, even close top stuff.

Florida thought electing Governor, little know he's also epidemiologist. 2-for-1. deal. even afraid get bloodwork done ""summer spike"" Florida labs always packed. ended finding mobile phlebotomist come house take blood backyard. one weirder things i've done pandemic i'm happy adapt haha I've wondering. Naturally anti-maskers leap chance take vaccine ASAP quickest way defeat pandemic stop using masks, right? anti-maskers turn anti-COVID vaxxers start causing scenes places require vaccination card (like flights going do)? Yeah, time go. lot literally cannot reach. rare see single person without mask grocery store WA. Oh man, touched nerve anti-vaxxer.

JHU prestigious school - make *student newsletter* trusted source anything (aside maybe cafeteria reviews). They've already issue one retraction went right wingnut's view COVID infection rates.

As big pharma pushing opioids - willing wipe entire industry actions few, basically researchers trying cure cancer prevent otherwise fatal diseases quick buck?

You need help buddy. Pretty sure Pfizer vaccine made BionTech german company based Mainz. 
Pfizer's HQ NYC idk manufacturing arm though. It‚Äôs sort rushed. RNA vaccines never used before. Yes, cut red tape, still haven‚Äôt observed effects vaccine beyond six, seven months - can‚Äôt actually speed time cutting red tape.

And don‚Äôt know vaccines don‚Äôt long term side effects. *shouldn‚Äôt* long term side effects, never know might go wrong comes new technology. really, really do. It‚Äôs going scare people they‚Äôre caught guard vaccines need help that. Mostly overweight diabetics foot wounds. poor circulation, weakened immune systems, can't feel lower extremities, lot can't even see reach feet.  come back post op check bam, maggots. 100% agreed. healthy people affected could understand means fit people suffer debilitating lung damage save people want move anyway. We're sacrificed them, we'll forced live like got choice. weed guy lol. think probably sick hung 2 weeks ago symptoms started made get tested. him, idea. autoimmune diseases I‚Äôve tried extra careful. true.  nothing nearly year caused significant problems US.

Okay? Saying employees allowed wear masks chose insane matter going pandemic.

FWIW, March 2nd (first Mon March remembered) started wearing mask office job. Got couple side comments masks reserved doctors whatever. told could take mask go home would lost it. know took sure? said media? That's relief, really want confirm got it. hit truck analogy spot on, warned worried placebo who'd gotten covid. really need make sure people aware Source is? current influenza vaccine 45% effective overall 2019-2020 seasonal influenza B viruses. Specifically, flu vaccine 50% effective influenza B/Victoria viruses 37% effective influenza Thank you. 1. one started banging Australia &amp; NZ...
2. point bullshit. course lockdown damaging, country. trade-off. money vs lives. wtf human rights talking about, tons selfish mfs running around spreading like bio terrorists called ""FREEDOM""???????? assume we're infected get tested then? single people one dinner together? like get Covid-19 family members. Uh, scary. imagine must inhaled pot hard also imagine there'd viral load big strong enough get sick immediately weed guy did... seems like would build bit days. Plus thought test positive 5+ days exposure (takes time viral load build), unless they've improved testing, maybe have, IDK. not, looks like got person, sucks since wore masks whole two-weeks ago, long time hold breath whether caught COVID not. 

Either way, totally sucks, hope feel back 100% soon. Michigan fans hope. assume it‚Äôll complete slaughter play OSU complete dicks usual run score. Closing schools definitely worse failing convince people wearing piece fabric faces necessary save lives reduce strain health care workers! /s No. Vaccines prevent infection. help fight active infections. Sorry its' helpful cousin lost sense smell Covid early September still come back Definitely blind end soon vaccine available, get end time trial. Numbers going quickly live, right still play important part study. behavior really changed one way other. Another great point outrage. doesnt consider entire picture. every person dies there's like 30 40 people need go hospital, people get lasting neurological damage damage lungs. 

That would like 100 million people total pretty severely affected it. annoys me. live country 11 million habitants, U.S. 328 million. stuff bloats numbers, plus lot nay sayers get trouble. Hospitals can't keep up. People die. need vaccine. NEEDS mandatory. want go shit again. 30%. Well, information usually get. Right? activities involve groups people gathering together. say one activity safer idiotic. expect anything else user though, they're borderline senile. makes sad. parent teenager languishing without school ,kids teachers prioritized fat folks... Adjusting number COVID cases people taking issue with. treating number cases severity independent assuming severity (%severe cases infected population) isolated removing infection rate (% infections total population) equation. Got spreadsheet? Seriously though, number wouldn‚Äôt different it‚Äôs mainly European countries worse us per capita. would pretty easy come long list countries better per capita us November. Great news America, wish over. two vaccines soon approved 90% efficacy, compared UK we've got Oxford one 70% efficacy. Listen, I'll take anything point, ideally better is, quicker over. hope Novavax J&amp;J vaccines next months well British German yes, Russian no

De-Russophobed you. welcome. call season. putting players risk good reason. then, there‚Äôs TV $.... I'm thinking one silver linings - least over, epidemiologists huge data set analyze years come - Florida (and several states) pretty much control/placebo group since much done....  based assumption, mostly validated antibody tests, ever confirmed case least 5 times actual cases.  


So 13 million confirmed cases, probably 65 million actual cases. track another 20 million cases December , probably January.  


so 30 percent infected isn‚Äôt bad guess, vaccines starting kick around January hopefully another 20 million people month. March April see light end tunnel.

The bad news we‚Äôll 400,000 dead immunity Northeast might start wearing - let‚Äôs hope vaccine pipeline stays strong. grandpa way. aunt going give sleep. Obesity obviously preventable, also socio-economic issue needs addressed, especially West. easy say eat healthy, working 14 hours day, trying run house kids handle rest lives issues, easy choose easy option, generally unhealthy option. need make healthy options accessible. Drive thru healthy meal rather drive thrus deep fried fries processed burgers. That's obviously example, one many options. Meme finger going protest, back down. Oh that‚Äôs great hear! really weird reaction beta blockers eventually recommended ablation see tracking two prediction methods reality pretty good right Thanksgiving. real numbers got worse, seems imply death rate went 12%. reporting went Thanksgiving, picked back yet. Good thing didn‚Äôt lose 10 lbs I‚Äôve meaning lose year Oil money tends that. Dumbest city Scotland? Aberdeen, economic engine North Sea oil extraction. know weird Cardiologist never gave option put beta blocker I've past 8 years done well Went mall today, saw older people people obese side wearing face masks wearing face shields, face masks mandatory people get inside take off. seriously don‚Äôt understand people clearly high risk don‚Äôt give fuck. There‚Äôs complicated answers this, essentially, can‚Äôt confirm anything medicine (or science general) unless reasonably state results wouldn‚Äôt happened due outside factors.

So everybody vaccine, 5% people got Covid, don‚Äôt actually know effectiveness. it‚Äôs 95%, nobody answer ‚Äúwell, many 95% avoided covid first place?‚Äù Maybe vaccine half effective test implied. control group allows answer that. Yeah dude die hard Covid people interpret moral competition lmao kind stay home order would be?
Because Sacramento lil 10 5 curfew ain't much... wishful thinking projected enjoying lifestyle. starters vaccination 100% effective protective measures carry thing heavily control. Yeah, good either, Patriots five hundered right now! part reason today. job provide leadership guidance federal level state governors provided leadership guidance local level. stood back silently orange muppet discredited scientists let fauci take fall stood guns despite opposite trump saying. took coward's way, get swoop act concerned ""there"" american public little long. damage done partly responsible that. happening country called USA. Stupid government leaders stupid Americans. 

They care anyone selfish bunch looks profits mind hurting others so.

I say always good people. disappearing one one. immunisation based theory benefits immunisation far outweigh risks delayed adverse events long term safety studies need educated public probably increasingly demand proper safety studies widespread immunisation. believe outcome decision development safer vaccine technology.

After all, article 1999, technology come long way since then. Especially medical sector. Yea I'd opposite, I'd rather take neither, I'd trust Russians Chinese virus, especially quality control. Chinese manufacturing general suspect cuts lot corners safety regulations. barely trust toys similar objects contaminated lead paint worse, let alone trusting vaccine I'm going inject. Russia known issues bad. Plus Russia basically steal Moderna technology essentially vaccine anyway? live 5 miles away Andiamo's. Meh food Boomer central. see one 40 willing going there.

Whitmer throw everything open, seat dining flow. I'm still going Plague Central drink priced wine, salty chicken alfredo.

I think restaurants estimate quick people rush back. school district virtual teaching January 11th. niece can't go back school, cool get feed bag December? can't imagine vaccine sit freezer long time anyway.

Once arrives places rollout time. Usually, posts like get removed. d-word banned word sub.

It make wrong though. I'm sure follow logic vaccine distribution go badly wrong. appreciate *could* that's plans evidence say far. go badly wrong, would ever able mop miss? said, vaccine program fails, see social end pandemic regardless.

Secondly, rate new infections absolutely plummets, would mean herd immunity, already reached ""normalcy"" year now? Herd immunity means rate transmission capped 1: rate infections plummets without additional measures reduce infections, definition reached herd immunity.

Thirdly, able vaccinate elderly vulnerable quickly, restrictions persist; deaths hospitalizations plummet people simply stop complying. Young people really don‚Äôt care anymore man 196 people 30,000? revisit ""key points"" summary clarify? makes sound like 29,804 people useless trial.

It also makes sound like 185 people placebo something efficacy. Yeah would sooo terrible pandemic ended sooner expected, we‚Äôd really hate that..../s

Is really ‚Äònew normal‚Äô crew angry people little bit cautious you?

I‚Äôd moon vaccine arms everyone wanted one April, April seems likely Beginning End vaccination general population. take time vaccinate everyone. maybe hiccups along way.

I worry people 100% convinced things totally normal April later..like mentally ok it‚Äôs later that? said one month? Two more? able accept lose hope? Creating strict deadlines head could setting major disappointment. 

I really really hope we‚Äôre normal April I‚Äôm gonna hold breath. 

No matter believe please don‚Äôt give timeline isn‚Äôt exactly predicted months before. official release Moderna, says ""The Company submit data Phase 3 COVE study peer-reviewed publication."" 
  
You know, like they've done literally previous phases people unfairly suspicious probably won‚Äôt. vaccines available doesn‚Äôt mean enough vaccine supply match population 1:1. supply concern, logistical concern, insurance concern( would assume). 

As nerd I‚Äôm looking like new video game consoles. technically released technically available good luck finding somewhere stock. 

Skepticism fair point. tell us it‚Äôll available lot potential caveats that.  Yeah reason one ones around locked

The last estimate saw three weeks meeting would roughly Christmas know exactly whether means would speed slow down

It's somewhat good sign they're beginning Stage vaccines , presumably someone governmental Authority told would okay start moving around expedite process approved truly awful read, heart goes poor woman. going see wave PTSD pandemic, frontline healthcare workers patients.

But also wanted add completely frivolous comment, apologize advance. ""Candi Brings Plenty"" BEST, HAPPIEST name heard while? (I know, Native American often descriptive last names, one simply AWESOME.)

I hope Candi makes complete recovery, although sounds article might not. wear masks, they'll lose even rights. Besides, disease care think rights.

Our newly stupid supreme court decided religion important public health - even though states allowed enforce fire codes buildings public health reasons.  Tell feelings I'm honestly confused statement. mean wellplate? talking plate wells qPCR reactions occur? ie something like ABS microamp optical 96-well reaction plate? I've never heard reused, they're always discarded. Opening one reaction occurred would cause whole lot contamination. painfully unaware privilege. say ‚Äúto get vaccine first‚Äù mean pharmacies/clinics populations? honest, haven‚Äôt heard discussion yet either. I‚Äôve heard posts health agencies saying at-risk groups frontline workers available first, it‚Äôll open populations. believe I‚Äôve heard available aged 80+ first, 65-80, 50-65, at-risk adults, gen pop, something along lines That's interesting. consultants saying store Pfizer vaccine indefinitely would take ~-80 temps, stored temporarily regular freezers 6 days? assume anything? Anyone attended Thanksgiving dinner outside immediate family get tested, stay home quarantine positive. people who've gotten virus recovered? Anecdotally, aunt recently told cousin virus back first wave around April, bad. hospital around Thanksgiving. reason suspect making facts wrong, friend-of-a-friend thing. 

So, case susceptible within 6-7 months, could susceptible much earlier, too, knows. I‚Äôm thrilled efficacy severe COVID. Covid especially harsh 80+ population high mortality age group... Keep grandpa grandma safe, people. Thank answer

Didnt know reddit need certificate tell profession :)) effective 

Nope Survival fatest don‚Äôt get grocery stores near reduced hours clean restock night. Yet get open (7am) tons employees restocking shelves. Fast. one amazing things this. developed means mass production time developed vaccine. Prior pretty unheard of. meant extremely flexible huge amounts coordination multiple factions working this. mRNA vaccines inherently safe widely expected pass safety testing easily. traditional vaccines based well-understood vectors, expected extremely safe too.

In fact, biggest problem testing many people suspect given placebos want drop test get real vaccine.

Nothing going happen, Placer County replaced conscientious public official somebody receptive pandemic-denying September, Placer County Public Health Officer Dr. Aimee Sisson resigned county Board Supervisors unanimously decided end COVID-19 emergency declaration passed March 3. replaced interim Public Health Officer Rob Oldham. Cool drugs Oh volunteer undergo inversion therapy? vaccine work all, find 196 infections, would expect 90 vaccine group 90 placebo group. probability 185 vs 11 breakdown less 0.1% vaccine work. confidence level severe vs non-severe wider, 0 vs 30, sure p value is, overall data looks quite solid. I‚Äôve never arm look like getting year‚Äôs flu shot. Fun times guess. It‚Äôs emergency One person placebo group actually died, yeah. Can‚Äôt forget trump owns stock company. remind someone comments ‚Äúfirst‚Äù online post. Maybe (hopefully) they've slowed, I'm sure reach kind conclusion based incomplete data we've gotten last 5 days. 175,000 confirmed cases day, I'd like see lot slower growth. Apparently know doing, done before, able testing done.


Also one trials started back March, actually giving doses people. started developing January. practically like know much vaccine virus popped wild. 39th deaths per capita... funny, Covid pretty similar symptoms much longer period. license bound following Hippocratic oath? realize they're literally required go they're risk losing license yes basically follow suit. We‚Äôve got volunteer! Probably, health anxiety. Still, I‚Äôd pissed skipped thanksgiving family get infected roomate. donate $50 month, like tithe certain percentage never pressure donate.  diocese ""pre authorized giving"" program, easy track tax purposes etc. Honestly - think Summertime we'll able relax number restrictions, see us hitting real sense ""normalcy"" next November. 

Vaccine rollout happen way want to:

- Healthcare workers get first dibs, take longer expected suddenly we're going find whole bunch CEOs Executives sorts money ""moonlighting"" ""healthcare workers""
- vaccines rolling vulnerable population next, true distribution infrastructure tested. vaccines require ridiculous refrigeration limited, manageable ambient shelf life (something like 24-48 hours, depending one is). Aside challenges refrigeration, many people going given vaccines fall outside shelf life? effective vaccine going be?
- Speaking shelf life refrigeration, many doses going get ruined mishandling?
- vaccines require 2 doses, dose takes weeks effectively work
 - many people go second dose?
 - many people assume moment they're pricked means they're safe? 

- Antivaxxers
- Simple lack access either due location, confusion paying (people learned already testing unconditionally free - true vaccines)?

Anyway - going slow burn. True herd immunity reached sometime 2022 2023, rate new infections absolutely eventually plummet later 2021 people get vaccinated (as well people gotten infected likely get re-infected). 

Like said - slow burn. least know contributing science time? virus spreading worldwide year. numbers March vastly underrepresented community spread. !RemindMe 8 weeks Thanks. realize there‚Äôs placebo branch reason, right? recipients don‚Äôt know whether got vaccine placebo; 94% measurement comparing two groups. like authors press release emotional psychics. point Fauci say felt terrified. ""The law"" one short sentence. far longer bible even though written coherently, probably still many ambiguous missing definitions contradictory statements.

So, course ""interpretation"" ""application"", judges decide balance various applicable laws specific case. Germany, even special term that: That‚Äôs amazing money, it‚Äôs good live spend it. Stay safe friend. provider reassigned, quit. job.

The Hippocratic Oath Declaration Geneva legally binding, versions know force treat circumstance. Lots words confident sounding tone trump bad.  Unfortunately, that's entire story. virus contagious also hitting people observed masks took eat restaurants, loved one brought home, non-confirmative hand washing practices. saw report California lot people gotten recently people observing level caution ever sure cases surging practices become risky. think reality becomes available environment, little things subconsciously always risky less availability impact us.  


Yes maskless keep base virus propagating environment, victims unmasked. friend since early spring campaigning Trump ranting Facebook restrictions gathering churches. week shared 3 GoFundMes 3 different people ICU Intubation one previous churches. that's impacted, strangers outliers friends family. disconnect prevents understanding results actions cause death suffering care actually see it, look ways improve EQ that's major cognitive dissonance. created straw man... one talking ‚Äúevents.‚Äù incorrectly labeled sports arts extracurricular. Frequentists go grr analyze data ask questions read reports? vet pretends everything like Times. Zero changes. know assistant asthma I've seen using inhaler. us kegal I'm looking new vet. Abnormally high number deaths=abnormally high number estate liquidations.

When family family can't use want estate sell it. Spring vaccine era, large spike death. would mean estate sales could held large crowds, would lots estates sell deaths. helpful! Thank much. started trump making politics US vs thing. people far gone still people saying conspiracy, deadly, re-open everything etc etc etc.

Its sickening stupid people Legend vibes. Good? Yes. Perfect? No. let perfect enemy good. pandemic. Adapt. Good. Go even fire ass. scared even drive? wrong driving around? People right travel, virus less 1% death rate stop people travelling. Physician here, I'm end things. One thing can't figure distributed organized way get vaccine first. guys discussed administration vaccine organized? Assays vaccines claim 100% efficacy confidence intervals IIRC. thats reading/writing diagnostic Sars-CoV-2 assays different vaccines ofc. long hit requirements youre good, nobody ACTUALLY claim 100%. Theres always disclaimer bottom. like need keep adding participants get LESS 100% either.

So EUA might say 100% clinical concurrence [95% CI: 97-100%] pr something like military also uses private airlines stuff like this. merchant marine. went station Germany higher stress 2nd LT could would usually leave Cpt E1 private usually E4 promotable E5 official app Tous AntiCovid [This article good fever, fatigue, headaches, swelling, muscle pain etc. like flu shot. Somewhere 2-10% population depending side effect vaccine. Gone within 24 hours.

It‚Äôs basically response due body fighting disease. Nothing serious long-lasting seen. would expect - theres specification required diagnosed relation withdrawal, withdrawal occur 2020. withdrawal doesnt need related diagnoses, either: definition coronavirus-related distribution section 2202(a)(4) CARES Act limit distributions amounts withdrawn solely meet need arising COVID-19. Thus, example, individual qualified individual result experiencing adverse financial consequences described above, coronavirus-related distributions permitted without regard qualified individual‚Äôs need funds, amount distribution required correspond extent adverse financial consequences experienced qualified individual. Yeah, can't sports year. understand desire scraps normalcy year gone mad two things professional sports shown us 2020 could nipped pandemic bud we'd willing commit resources (which makes blood boil) way many Americans fine risking peoples' lives creature comforts (which depresses fuck me). Wish could save photos stories send idiots whenever get whole conspiracy BS say ""its old people"" masks work versus covid?

Redneck flame thrower found Everything gamble. There's potential side effects vaccine. vast majority us, that's lesser chance chance Covid serious.

Can point cases vaccines caused long term effects soon discovered? swine flu vaccine mentioned shut less three months launched. Already happening hometown. 

They‚Äôre choosing admit COVID case except person severely ill, they‚Äôre 99% capacity. They‚Äôre reopen old closed hospital, shortage trained staff look people administer treatments. peaks around Christmas mean can't another peak later ;) That's fair. still stand point, solving problem know better fearing one may may exist. respect point view though, valid circumstances global pandemic would agree you. Well, good luck americans! eat veggies hey 6% people died ""real"" deaths right?? want take risk stay home. Nobody stopping you. Covid-19 less dangerous around flu is. flu comes around next year (it skipped year reason) make decision whether hunker 5 months go participate society bear consequences it. pretend I'm staying home safety noting board house keep leaving. believe meant reply another comment mine.

But see that. Theoretically though could approve nesting. given timeline approval? imagine won‚Äôt take long meeting. thought lol like golf ball size welt huge bruise virus started kept thinking someone super famous would die would make people take seriously. Super famous people getting sick recovering news lot hurt imo since made people feel like everyone know recovered. point don‚Äôt think matters much. Prowse isn‚Äôt famous enough get wide attention either tool old many people really care anyway unfortunately. 

But might among famous people heard died anyway. British serial killer Peter Sutcliffe died prison Herman Cain around known maybe different ways. considered obese according BMI &amp; exercise daily eat strict diet full veggies rarely, ever, snack.

if ate less (or normal amount) obese. luck, diet. Working big box stores like walmart, grocery stores, fast food places considered safe, well blm protests Biden celebrations.

Thanksgiving dinners, funerals, religious services, working small businesses deemed extremely dangerous, assume going get sick die participate activities.

Source: following Science  I‚Äôm Moderna study many us (in-person) teachers, bus drivers, grocery workers, etc., medical grade PPE wear simple cloth masks high-transmission community. rights eroded name community good? eating indoors restaurant isn‚Äôt constitution. asking low price Chinese made Panda toy bought bulk be? Amazing analysis. 20m per month think low end 2021. We're December (hopefully) manufacturing getting started 1 vaccine. likely we'll 3 january/February think weds see least double monthly Vac rate February upward trend there. oufs things line spring estimate I've hearing. This, mentioned, assumes general social distancing throughout, actually think accepted half country hope we'll good messaging federal leadership then. People still think hoax yeah far gone. Way gone. right. never said anything CVS. merely promised would get vaccinated Christmas. Ahhh okay that‚Äôs thought process, thanks letting know.  TIL. Makes sense. boss move Pfizer, nobody would said damn thing they‚Äôd taken money like ‚Äúno that‚Äôs alright folks got shit.‚Äù I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs upside like able keep profits something pretty Big Dick Energy turn help *still* one first finish would work? Obese people even want go confirm fatness they're chosen let's honest, that's kind embarrassing them. 

""Yep, definitely morbidly obese, come up!"" LOL thats nothing. 46.2 11 cases COVID total trial vs. 185 got placebo. quick back-of-the-envelope math would give likelihood 15% happening ‚Äúby chance‚Äù, i.e. there‚Äôs 15% happening even vaccine doesn‚Äôt improve outcomes gives lower chance getting COVID. That‚Äôs unlikely unlikely completely unheard of. one telling people sTaY hOmE want go large gatherings. one saying can't essential things....but nooooooooo...you want take extreme....you want great big parties. clear immature child mommy shopping, cooking, cleaning.

Want us sTaY hOmE? Keep partying spreading virus everywhere. See one get access medical care anymore. See happens enough people get sick there's one work meat processing facilities, drive trucks transport goods markets, one work grocery stores, one work pharmacies, one produce goods. 

See happens keep spreading shit crisis proportions. think could massive lockdown even groceries open? 

It clear thought through. upstate NY, hope go back regional approach; county live (Tompkins) day 1 done better surrounding counties Southern Tier, Cuomo erroneously put us phased reopening Finger Lakes Region, businesses counties far worse numbers reopened almost full month ahead us. Even one two major colleges (Cornell) county opting person classes 10,000 students travel back area, numbers still comparatively low surrounding counties. relief sight Federal Government individuals, small medium businesses, stats local governments, shutting needs absolute last resort. We're heading winter; people NY northern states literally freeze death shut without feds extending expanding unemployment passing another round stimulus without red tape get immediately. matters *difference* placebo non-placebo. amount cases within one 2 groups isolation. rule succession grounded needing information essentially zero credibility, especially small n like 30 wut Maybe vaccine administered. There's much anti-vax propaganda going right people look say ""Oh no, guy died, I'm getting it."" lol. That's ""double-blind""! still hero. Thank you! Yup. live NYC, noticed lot TJ‚Äôs stores closed around May deep cleaning. Nowadays, don‚Äôt really close stores anymore. Upper West Side employee said least four coworkers tested positive COVID-19 last two weeks.

Why can‚Äôt workers stay home? Agreed. Pre-pandemic favorite grocery store, stopped shopping offer curbside delivery. Uses bluetooth randomized number keep people anonymous, relies honor system infected people report app, notifies others proximity. work unless ""everyone"" using app.  commented elsewhere, I‚Äôm Moderna trial. live lives normally (observing COVID safety, masks, distancing, etc.) city community transmission high. us get COVID, compared vaccine/placebo groups see vaccine protected us normal exposure. acquaintances often think purposely sprayed COVID. whole world population essentially placebo group right now, there‚Äôs nothing unethical study. I‚Äôm realistic. compare soldier nurse? Lol. get people dying. Didn‚Äôt sign place people....uhhh......die..........? Lol they‚Äôre blowing bodies pieces. They‚Äôre always do‚Äîwork hospital. wise decision would find better model. probably understand better do. third party understanding folks compromised immune systems get full benefit vaccine still risk. I'm thinking either misunderstood trusted wrong source. may still transmit virus. Given parents positive, could carry virus another. stay put recover.

If don‚Äôt stay home, please wear mask keep distance others.  Sure great jobs require office ""not home"". chose company work probably decided fine crap got tossed you. Sure can't afford switch careers job hunt whatever reason. ultimately still choice. Every damn one us choice whether sleep less develop skills better job awesome perks take gamble switch careers. sheep honest reporting avoid shutdown entire sectors economy again. honestly appreciate it. Keeps local gym open. still here? Man must embarrassing you. 

But admire gumption sticking people can't look themselves.

That's....something, guess. Right course, anything zero ‚Äòripping ass normal people profits‚Äô hyperbole all. Also since flu shots free America seems likely it‚Äôs free America it‚Äôs going free every country act together (As America sets low bar). 

I opposed socialized healthcare, opposed ridiculous unsupported claims like OP made. NFL allowed game played yesterday without real QB game played well. Scale happening every major company institution that's Phase II Phase III trails. bigger players millions doses month already (and producing several months now) new production facilities coming online either next months.

This one times pretty much ever large pharma company gone ""fuck it, care much costs, need done"" (read: profits fucked stable society pandemic causing lockdown cycles economic depression) idea talking about. Lol, hell pay delay. America, don‚Äôt hold officials accountable, come now. 

I get angry, let‚Äôs try keep discussion fact based. And? change pandemic? like London virus originated.

Guess country got visitors Wuhan? country got first confirmed international case? Thailand. Bangkok course one visited city world, *the* visited city world.

If country vastly inefficient government control it, think anyone else able control it. Wha? tested 30k people, half receiving vaccine. Moderna careful make sure racial makeup US; Fauci even helped recruit additional people color enough volunteers. good news vaccine works across racial lines. Tbh without vaccine would likely fucked anyway. necessary sacrifice greater good. That's hilarious mine similar. order almost test ask always misinterpret results. I'm grateful I'm smart well-versed biology cause damn. tried coco powder, lil sugar, walnuts yet? I‚Äôm sure move somewhere that‚Äôs better quality, island result bygone age. deserves worst. Governor Ron ""Death Sentence"" DeSantis bad constitution guarantees rights allow erosion people see fit. Compensating trial participants generally seen bad idea, ethically speaking sample size 15000 Sounds like hypnagogic hallucinations. Imagine people feel universal healthcare pay care alcoholics, drug abusers, obese, smokers think they're nothing wrong lifestyle choices. bad math :D He's age father-in-law father-in-law looks like Crypt Keeper comparison. nice civil discourse starting personal attacks projection proven wrong. Sorry. It‚Äôs almost impossible change people‚Äôs mind listening false information. people putting information held criminally accountable. Health binary spectrum thousands factors.

You try move goalposts want, obesity medical condition excess body fat accumulated extent negative effect someone's health. Also whole point article topic about. I'm trial I'm certain got placebo, first side effects, second ultimately get antibodies tested none. dissappointed learn got placebo. I'm happy part study though honestly, saw possible opportunity get immunity. don‚Äôt give shit ‚Äúrights‚Äù

I‚Äôll take people‚Äôs lives abstract principle slave owners designed hundreds years ago. entirely fault two specific people can't namedrop removed immediately auto mods. Places lock aid available like March. Many countries federal mask mandates near-universal compliance people ventilators well. headline pure click bait. levels negatives types someone explain producing studies third party examining data? That's pretty appropriate response.

Even vaccinated, unclear prevents asymptomatic carrier transmitter. Although we'll probably figure next year.

_You_ might fine, mean unknowing vector infect someone else. Jfc people think that?? 

Tho put past CCP prisoners official drug trial US??? Wow people need critical thinking Nope, saline per paperwork. black friday?

2 days ago?

that's enough time cases show up.

&amp;#x200B;

it's contact tracing... people told them

so ""Walmart"" 

OR 

they went Walmart ***THEN*** birthday party, tell contact tracers party.

&amp;#x200B;

EVERYONE country needs get food.. El Paso, ""mysterious"" reason.. also needs extra morgue trucks... problem buying food. mayor also mentioned **contact tracers** finding regards residents catching virus.  deep dive contact tracing week ***November 10th 16th found 55% positives coming shopping large retailers, we‚Äôd term big box stores,‚Äù*** Margo said. ‚ÄúAnd considered essential CISA guidelines homeland security. don‚Äôt really have- don‚Äôt control limitations there.‚Äù Dear God. things seen... sure people getting joke... Sorry friend, late lot people. soon double record hospitalizations covid peak spring summer almost 60,000 people. 

In spring saw record highs 2,600 per day dead. summer seeing deaths start climb data rerouted Whitehouse scrubbed. know true rate years time. 
 
I've stated could see 5k dead per day peak, thats similar lock style spring right now. 
 
If hospitalizations continue(which really can't certain point) people dying homes holiday season. Well, especially subreddid lot prople claim medical professionals reality aren't. think actual verification process makes lot sense. Exactly Fair enough minimum 15% immunity end 2020,

My understanding there's 1 month buffer immunity. point, see impact 2020. Cuomo added spring surge patients could moved around state unaffected areas case time statewide. limited ability bring resources upstate downstate spring ‚Ä¶ literally every region dealing hospital issue now,"" said never said plan. stating say fat people lazy, get ridiculed ""fat shaming"".
I go telling fat people, they're fat. right, accomplishes nothing. also pity them, that's problem. got feeling vaccine going blow faces try frame like save health care workers injure tending fat people ICU.  post-covid vacation fund

It's called ""retirement"". Oh man, big deal. buddy FEMA deployment it‚Äôs soul crushing.

It sucks much.   agreed... one claims get sick spread virus.

This factually incorrect. I'm sure long tracking news, I've since late last year, early claims explicitly stated children catch spread virus contrary common sense, personal experience, scientific evidence contrary children significant vectors any/all communicable diseases.

Fauci echoed early SK studies demonstrating children 9 likely spread it: corollary, must explicate it, children *younger* 9 *not* spread it.

This article, quotes Betsy DeVos claiming children ""COVID stoppers,"" contradicts claim ""no one"" says (regardless feel DeVos). Fauci's rebuttal lackluster, best: ""we still need learn lot young children COVID-19. **A recent study came showed children 10 years old‚Ä¶they don‚Äôt necessarily spread infection adults do**,"" (emphasis added)

When discussing elementary school children, ages 5-9, consistent implication neither spread contract disease appreciable levels, non-sensical unsubstantiated evidence far--mainly collected multiple people, work primary education, stating. ikr Starting today, RI‚Äôs gone back asking every business possible return WFH, last spring early summer. then, RI ranked 5th US deaths per capita. We‚Äôre 7th now, think. So, depends state / city you‚Äôre in. There's one way account height weight. BMI uses **square** (2) height, grew, would go taller wider, taller, wider, deeper (which would **cube** (3) height).

It's accurate use square height. probably accurate use cube either, proper exponent probably 2.3 2.7.

The long short tall people average higher BMIs, mean one two things:

Tall people average fatter short people (the opposite seems case) measurement take height account **enough**. Tall people also report uncharacteristically high BMIs often shorter average people. kidding.  French done lockdown. What's open what's closed? get that, logically speaking may easier vaccinate ultra-high risk folks first. less them, many likely close hospitals nursing homes, stay put 30 days doses. studies basically seem boil to, ""healthier people less likely die"". Well, long health professionals elder still first group, would object. mean, take Vitamin-D every day hope somewhat limits severe Covid. I'd take something 10% efficacy. Trumper extended family's father die Covid. still Thanksgiving dinner 16 people, nerve call asshole called it.

Fingers crossed. Here's important Susan Baker volunteered Johnson &amp; Johnson‚Äôs JNJ -0.28% vaccine trial seek protection Covid-19. reason, may drop study. ... nurse practitioner North Carolina treated Covid-19 patients hospital. takes care people high risk, including dialysis patients husband father, medical conditions. catches virus spreads anyone vulnerable, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know could forgive myself,‚Äù said. Ms. Baker may drop J&amp;J‚Äôs vaccine trial. took antibody test indicating received placebo instead actual vaccine study. positive early results vaccines Pfizer Inc. PFE +2.08% Moderna Inc. MRNA +16.85% pointing toward use U.S. possibly within weeks, wants first line get one, though previously agreed stick study could fully vet J&amp;J‚Äôs injection. Authorization advanced vaccine candidates would mark turning point fight Covid-19. Yet might also set back effort, compromising ongoing vaccine trials, including Pfizer‚Äôs Moderna‚Äôs, prompting volunteers quit. Researchers scheduled two-year trials leading vaccines. didn‚Äôt plan tell volunteers whether got shot placebo study ends. Subjects agreed terms upon signing up. Frederick Feit, volunteered Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine trial thinks got placebo, said would get shot soon purpose enrolling. ‚ÄúIt never altruistic,‚Äù said Dr. Feit, 72-year-old cardiologist NYU Langone Health. ...

Basically, vaccine trials often set two year periods, case vaccines fast-tracked within months. people got placebo want trial. least companies acknowledged ethical obligation inform volunteers status approving vaccine, may never know true trial outcomes.

In particular, disgusting lack scientific ethics part nurse doctor article. NP unblinded herself, contaminates point data, gall complain getting vaccine puts work risk. doctor admits jump head line. people need vaccines work, never going able stay got placebo.  considered unethical purposefully inject people deadly diseases. call ""challenge"" trials chimps, give vaccine expose purposefully covid. allowed people.

Well 'misdiagnose' physically *healthy*. Obesity, however spin it, bad physical health. 'HAES' total utter nonsense regard.

Obviously one store, hey, figured I'd share positive vibes lieu article. 100 severe. 94 symptoms. I'm terrible person Color surprised. ‚ÄúWe know flu vaccine studies population (of long-term care residents) tends less efficacy flu vaccine compared persons.‚Äù

That's important point. Interesting. rolled Xywav already. Lots talk /r/Narcolepsy  I'm betting rats coyotes, maybe even raccoons. family live 6 hours away me, normally fly see them. 
My dad told refuses get vaccine strong immune system. also refuses get yearly flu shots. I've already told family know I'll seeing again...I idea safe fly again. feeling I'll wearing mask long pandemic declared ""over."" boyfriend also wary vaccine, quickly made...which get. He's also COVID (despite taking precautions, distancing etc), least he's got immunity. Thankfully, wants data mass vaccinations happen likely he'll get data drops. Cool, care. Can't live like forever, I'm vaccinated I've done part. 

Children really getting affected COVID appreciable numbers anyway. it? supposed kind real conversation who's responsible deaths? strong rules great, they‚Äôre going address issue hand, need doctors. 

Mask laws can‚Äôt retroactively fix spike unfortunately. They‚Äôre proactive. stuck repercussions   opinion ""entertainers"" essential workers. Every year doctors prosecuted insurance, Medicare, Medicaid Yeah, I've super curious hospitals run. I'm denying claims brink. I'm wondering full hospitals avg pandemic. who? how? Thank god monero dark web everyone anti vaxxer right left whatever Europe heard bad bunch stupid people world no, leftists aren't. ""stay indoors"" anything workers owning means production? see word fascist? didn't.

His lack attention action encouragement anti mask followers led this. control situation require measures created enforced.

I'm talking *this* situation *only*. got little lax stage 3 re-openings Pay better? Enforce fines people stupid shit pandemic actually safe enough teachers teach? would foolish dangerous people cannot get vaccine yet like immunocompromised children. Kinda deep sad think people would alive today Covid never happened. Id like thank person died service humanity. signed trial ended back luck sacrifice gets us closer ending dark time. suck, thats dont tell you.

Thats doctors dont know. 

In double blind studies like this, even placebo actual vaccines identical except vial SKUs, tell gets what, interpiting data. 

Its way though. keep snake oil salesmen claiming bottle tap water piss jesus medically dangerous equally stupid substance. Anytime get fever auditory hallucinations. hear conversations, usually. laying bed two people chatting like office. Super strange. First time happened 7 bed mom sick. remember laying staring poster wall listening two people chat.  It‚Äôll interesting see gets second. Obviously first healthcare workers who? I‚Äôve seen suggestions of: elderly, essential workers/minorities, teachers, obese... obviously concur point. really grinds gear nowadays ease people (medical professionals general public alike) coming plans keep new infections minimum without ever considering wider impact plans would put action. say accept whatever comes adjust behavior best abilities. easy call non-essential travel stopped/restricted, ignoring impact availability flights essential travel. easy call schools closed, ignoring potential long term impact due lack socialization children parents unable work remotely means sending kids daycare. easy call people work remotely working industry particularly well suited remote work general office jobs. easy tell people stay home stable relationship, live family, get along well neighbors allows talk people face face keeping distance right garden. Others may moved across country pandemic started, may live alone, may struggling getting career started coming straight college, etc.  Clearly go OSU understand game means entire restaurant bar business there.

Getting sick people shrugging losses events crucial survival restaurant gig economy, people really hurting workers get first dibs, take longer expected suddenly we're going find whole bunch CEOs Executives sorts money ""moonlighting"" ""healthcare workers""

I actually agree this. Anyone thinks least doses vaccine go highest bidder(s) need remember back March wealthy unfettered access Covid testing. Entire sports teams could get testing (multiple times wanted). meantime, TX even get tested hospital unless admitted dire symptoms negative flu swab. 

I think it'll delay larger vaccine program long since people make less 1% general population. It'll still piss people see Kardashians ilk running around St. Barts February without masks able get vaccinated first. turned around fast. I've admittedly keeping what's going every state thought Rhode Island handling things reasonably well? Yeah dunno that. Hopefully they'll hang onto second dose, said he's concerned people come back side effects first dose unpleasant cases. placebo controlled. can't think social distancing factor would influence vaccine group. ""official"" date right June 1st, that's still subject change. rumors later reopening, though. One show particular (the revival Music Man) specifically push opening December. ravens need forfeit. league wants make money they‚Äôll probably game absurd. Common sense common, people dumb hate break you, likely exposed one way another point. 

Even spouses dont spread often. Someone posted recently chances getting someone live fairly low. used health care workers example occupational risk. I‚Äôm fucking bartender hot spot - access kind thing, around 100+ unmasked people day. selected. last study appointment, person waiting room told selected vocally anti-mask, puts high exposure risk. 

I understand cautious critical, 3 different types participants within study chosen carefully certain reasons. really boils selecting people higher risk complication people higher risk contracting it.

I also think it‚Äôs bit delusional assume folks 60 folks pre-existing conditions ‚Äúisolating begin with‚Äù. That‚Äôs far norm live, admittedly conservative state Bible Belt. Especially consider ‚Äúpre-existing conditions‚Äù include asthma, obesity, etc. plenty folks conditions absolutely isolating home, study participants otherwise. guess I‚Äôd imagine they‚Äôd test people exposed getting virus 30k people don‚Äôt seem chance getting it. 

If understand correctly, participants screened hand considered ""high exposure"". words, likely people public get infected. believe attitude maybe see something don't. propose help beyond provide emotional support? I‚Äôm masks, stories sample sizes two get sea. Broadway announce earlier dont plan reopen late 2021 (like late november/early December ish?) Professional sports must abide regulations city/county/state. 49ers find new place play Santa Clara County prohibits contact sports right now. also see fans stands certain locations.

The NBA right. teams sent one place locked down. breaking lockdown grounds suspension. talking earlier today office, wondering when/if sick leave expires. 2 positives otherwise get sick time. Yay, lovely. Wow. incredibly good news hear. Mad shout outs scientists able produce effective vaccine short amount time. Science awesome. govt this? thing Norway, read seems messaging every country well. One thing baffled country's join forces vaccine, collaborating lockdown.. country shutdown time 2-4 months done shit now? emergency authorization, even priority review. Mostly leftists now, conservatives slowly coming around. El Pasoan here. mask order enforced private businesses. This. Very, cases people getting twice confirmed testing twice. thought earlier year well, tested negative. lot people got flu something else assumed covid, claim got twice actually get covid. 

Re-infection confirmed possible far exceedingly rare. long immunity lasts certainly debate, seem likely catch covid twice within short time frame least. Europe might 3, approve Oxford one US. Awwww, finally admitted wrong assertion opinion rooted sort facts whatsoever.

See, feel task force last 9 months?

I mean, they've TV anywhere every day couple times week last 9 months. been?

Just stop, nobody's buying it. graphs clearly show cases increasing. please link specific page think shows something different l explain misunderstanding data, although genuinely difficult grasp - graph going shows number cases going up. difficult concept. Yes, sorry, meant federal government yeah i'm going dine public it'll take better food get take risk. wonder states going largest share anti-vaxxers? conspiratorial alt-right, far left believe natural alternative remedies, well Latinos cling homeopathic cures, African Americans who're leery vaccine experiments. giving essential workers significantly reduce death toll. main threat hospital overload hospital workers getting coronavirus forced quarantine 2 weeks (and rare cases dying suffering serious side effects knock months). Vaccinating health workers means less attrition, thus workers ready treat everyone else.

They're also going hit extremely at-risk populations vaccine, also significantly cuts hospitalization rate. also live island. can't compensate someone vaccine drug works bias/incentivize make sure data looks good. 

For example, report fever Monday want make money trial participation. fever ended couple days earlier actually did. leads skewed safety data.

What suggesting pharma company tell participants drug/vaccine looks good, get paid extra, wink wink. That's terrible science. 

Many trials compensate trial participation overall regardless outcome. job mean immune burn-out, fear, worry, depression, etc. know alternative, feel like big void psychological support/mental health support right Yeah. remember reading first assumptions showing antibodies remain 3-4 months. People accepting shown better normal. Naaaah SJWs find 5 years ago made remark could interpreted racist they'll tear statue. fed going spiteful provide covid relief

The ‚Äúfed‚Äù meaning federal reserve can‚Äôt that. meant ‚Äúfederal government‚Äù, carry on. how? how? please explain.  Based allocation tests NBA get nurses doctors. certainly understand many illnesses reason hospitalized Covid according Covidtracking.com, Rhode Island 317 patients hospitalized Covid according ahd.com Rhode Island total 2440 staffed beds statewide. That‚Äôs less 13% beds taken Covid patients. I‚Äôm asking genuinely don‚Äôt know, Rhode Island hospitals normally run 87% full that‚Äôs would without Covid patients. seems high. who? who's embracing it? talking about? I‚Äôm scientist Collin. can‚Äôt remember last time saw someone maskless store why? 1918 came went got us ""normal"" used to. would possibly think that? remember someone commenting back February March awful pandemics are, almost like time traveled lived one before. 

It really amazing many problems thing created. correlation onset symptoms severity illness? example, start symptoms two days exposure likely severe case? connection? know that. Hence pretty safe. I'm New Zealand keep close eye daily announcements border community cases. big complaint nurses posting dance videos? upvoted? something I'm understanding? county? 

Police North Texas respond trespassing complaint( always ), arrest anyone wearing mask.  unknown general viruses immune little chance spreading it, people assume COVID. get infected immune, virus get chance replicate enough pose significant threat others. immediately attacked inside body cleared relatively quickly, hence get chance even develop symptoms truly immune. Don‚Äôt love hypocritical governors banning individuals coming home going gatherings themselves. Shows seriously take virus think nobody looking. would best choice certain people. hear you, work healthcare well. co-workers assholes. hope nothing happens them, protect you. Stay safe.

P.S. anyone else worried zombie apocalypse now? me? wild scenarios I'm imagining, like COVID-20, etc., failed vaccines weird ingredients causing issues. Ugh sorry :( imagination big brain. Brazilians call it, Tuesday. basically Americans? confirm first responders bit, department head already started ground work get want phase 1 vaccinations list. like didn‚Äôt hundreds thousands people protesting streets

But see surge that. long that? those, like me, better visual references, here's comparison different BMI levels: stock use I‚Äôm buying gifts people don‚Äôt explicitly request something person shopper. year I‚Äôm getting anyone gift tho Gf dog ""So minimum 15% immunity end 2020""

More 30-40 million virus consider recent surge massive one yet majority surge died yet. guess closer 50-60 million. 20% immunity enough completely eradicate virus, huge chunk. factor (excluding vaccinations) people tend get virus also people tend spread virus, meaning original 50-60 million going outsized impact transmission rates. likely get/spread virus likely already gotten hard-hit places, meaning becomes difficult spread virus time there. Interesting info know. makes wonder covid managed spread much considering seems relatively easy avoid main method transmission sharing air space extended period time. would seem even grocery shopping isn‚Äôt high risk. guess maybe people social spreading way. 30,000 subjects massive study Good bot Exciting stuff!

Also wanted say thank continued high contributions responses sub daily threads. truly appreciate learned lot posts! don‚Äôt think CDC signs bills I'm glad could tell everyone wonder nice used car market wealthy buy rent profit like houses. Probably new tech way make reality. Air BnB vehicles. Excellent news!! Ever hear Murphy's Law? come crying distribution turns clusterbeep ... told so. Idk. pretty incensed situation. legit think there's tiny percent population things like gets them, either indirectly directly. Like dude boat Australia sea months landed Hawaii shocked everything locked abandoned. Like odds sea like pandemic shuts humanity worldwide. 99.999% baby! Pfizer actually 1 severe vaccine cohort, maybe not, mostly.

Moderna 30 severe cases trial, placebo, possibly not. get alot vitamin D! Lol I'm wondering whether test also injecting volunteers covid letting walk around vaccine seeing catch it? think would make sense inject covid see vaccine truly good appears. vaccine group wear masks public? sinc 

sync Makes sense keep schools open kids go get infected bring back virus home, like Poland. Sounds like someone didn‚Äôt read article. ::slaps roof bioreactor:: Dont 40% covid never show symptoms?

 scary findout got semi rare side effect new vaccine virus hat 40% chance never even knowing had.

 What's rush vaccinate everyone? vaccinate risk concerned. Thank you! don‚Äôt know enough question provide counter argument agree thank explanation something like 50% false negative rate. **Moderna Announces Primary Efficacy Analysis Phase 3 COVE Study COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate Filing Today U.S. FDA Emergency Use Authorization:** 

Most notably: ""Vaccine efficacy severe COVID-19 **100%** "" ( 0 severe cases vaccine arm. 30 severe cases placebo arm 1 death... ) Thanks glimmer dread future. needed today :P first could headlines read bit misleading seemed indicate therapeutic use this, made sense me. 

But indeed excellent news. Even totally prevent getting COVID, rest assured body able fight whatever get. seems says either/or...am reading wrong? adverse effect finances wife fortunately already kept home work general outbreak. I'm able access retirement funds early advantageous want make sure I'm wrong way. Oof yeah would ridiculous. Ivanka Trump: ""Dr. Fauci total Debbie Downer!"" thing is, calculate statistics likely ""0"" outcome legitimately is. control 30.

More data revealed time, I'm stoked. Oh yeah would jumped ship long time ago. administrators perfectly fine save money expense medical staff. Bless hearts vet too. allow go dog long wore mask (that‚Äôs fine me). Putin propaganda. him, give damn that, guess simplistic CNN infused brain still gotten it.

You're one brought Russia started licking boots Hopefully starts within next 2 weeks available spring. good candidate using proven safe methods. Fake news   
A. 
B. survive 
C. realize Trump administration saying this, right? plus side, least they're honest doubling random quote taken context six month old study. Polling data?? talking totally knew. shows incapable holding public office. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. OF. THEM. 

Greed. Favors. Bribes. Whatever else losers do. 

I'm still pissed whole ""taskforce"" done. Instead pandering orange one co, gone rogue. Created fucking task force let Trump scream little void Twitter. 8-9 months beginning pandemic 2-3 effective vaccines, still seems like miracle. top first kind mRNA vaccine. I'm still pretty fascinated lol Answer. aren‚Äôt wearing mask long. law, trader joes part nc limiting number shoppers allowed since start this. Ha! couldn‚Äôt think good way finish line. exceeded 2 months median follow-up post vaccination

What number vaccines? Class 3 obesity small portion population, now. ones prioritize maybe figure societal (like convenience food Standard American Diet) medical factors causing weight high here, read multiple times people dying street government welding people homes. dont worry disease overseas see actions taken. Welding citizens homes normal reaction, thats panic. saw Chinese government panicking, knew trouble trump leader.

My lease coming around time starting, remember line thinking things may break may see mass unemployment. Fortunately current complex cheapest rent could find, signed 15 month extension. People want wear masks reason, I'm much better since buildings massive hotel like structures complexes I've loved in.

I've basically refused leave apartment since March, worst fear catching covid asymptomatic, unknowingly giving someone else kills them. appreciate concern. found reading science behind vaccines, re-assured feel. things consider:

Re long term effects:

1. Long term effects modern vaccination much thing, couple issues may may linked H1N1 vaccines, namely type nerve problem called GBS type sleep disorder called narcolepsy, vaccine *did* trigger them, manifest within couple months, max. ""effects years road"" never observed, despite lot monitoring. 
2. mRNA vaccine vector spike vaccines believed safer traditional vaccines, deliver Covid signature spike whole dead virus like H1N1 flu vaccines. flu vaccine might possibly trigger GBS/narcolepsy flu able trigger GBS/narcolepsy. spike vaccines lot targeted, less likely over-stimulate immune system cause neurological issues. 
3. fair skeptics, mRNA vaccine vector spike vaccines relatively new, know way cause problems mean risk free. However, general public expected get vaccinated next spring, nearly year data first batch volunteers.

Re rushed:

1. scientific part vaccine rushed. admin steps accelerated, biggest time saver manufacturers producing vaccine ""at risk."" Normally, would wait evidence effectiveness come start manufacturing. vaccine pre-made ready ship soon approved. 
2. vaccine trials succeeded quickly disease spreading fast. Normally, takes years infectious disease vaccines prove effectiveness, volunteers get infected fixed rate. Covid spreading rapidly evidence effectiveness generated much faster pace.
3. used vaccine development taking decades that's saw lifetimes. early vaccines easy 1800's physicians really know viruses could develop rudimentary vaccine within months work. Vaccine research existing diseases slow easy problems got solved centuries ago. Covid brand-new virus, could easy rabies hard HIV, think got lucky. like SARS1, might still stuck animal research phase. April- May 2021 start significant form normalcy Summer 2021, new normal (Fall 2021) crew getting old Maybe instead constantly spewing bullshit, read every while. might learn something. hehe problem I've seen last 10 years stupid infectious disease. real dunning Kruger problem society people dumb realize dumb see people acting stupid emulate realizing shockingly stupid are.

It's causing amplification stupid behavior.

It's like one black friends said beginning 2016 - ""well least transparency racism now""

Can agree transparency led massive increase white supremacy hate crime?

There real tangible effects allowing negative circumstances thrive open society. think needs deep discussion trade-offs suppression hatred, ignorance, racism violence allowing thrive.

we really fucked-up position right now. America hole everyone seems grabbing shovels dig deeper. Black Friday area looking pretty empty compared last year good. Still many people bad expected. issue need see doctor person, scared go visit office. already done e-visit; actually see me. 

I know going huge issue lot people cause issues compound lot people. That's already case several states Go somewhere else total line bullshit. know probably 4 doctors group, handful pediatric nurses. 
They paid put kids schools.

They using things like research, expertise personal experience give guidance people that. 

Grow brain. word ‚Äústudy‚Äù gets overused give greater air authority. like ‚Äúrecent polling data suggests decrease cases.‚Äù Im American love every thread Sub drags Trump somehow Informed consent makes ethical people participate vaccine study. informed known side effects risks, entire process study, well option drop time.

The hippocratic oath requires medical professionals harm. harmful person, even one gives consent, deliberately infect disease known cure treatment, fatal. 

There‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs big reason challenge trials ethically questionable. vaccine news seems positive, prospect things becoming somewhat normal exciting. However, bit concerned potential side effects vaccine. anti-vax, however, based limited understanding, also see possibly rushed market, way see legit claims long term side effects since way could possibly tested yet. also read swine flu vaccine 70's rushed caused severe side effects people. also feel pretty confident Faucci says, again, could even know long term possibly side effects? something missing here? Thought humorous. worthy -23(-22 +) votes. Yeah, city less ""drive mile"" ""walk two blocks"" ""take subway couple stops"", would guess people live work different zones. zip codes cover tiny amounts land, targeted shutdowns kind useless. 100% effective trial small sample cases, clear! almost certainly due random chance vaccine 100% effective.

that said, good news efficacy - wary vaccine skeptics going around citing 100% number there's inevitably severe case someone got vaccine true colors. Selfish n stupid Let fix - ‚Äúput toxins body protect someone &lt;99.95% survival rate‚Äù - 267,000 Americans died cunt. true that‚Äôs I‚Äôve saying while, put eloquently me. Thanks wish right dunno. crazy many health care workers anti science. paramedics. We, EMS side, supposed take infectious disease classes every year(along blood borne pathogens classes included 2 year recert cycles).  
Luckily, unfortunately, work town New England got hit hard early, people paramedic side taking seriously. cops, getting sent medicals, seeing seeing going peoples homes. firefighters get proper training. MA, advised send 1 person person non-ambulatory, determine sick sick, quickly extricate house additional person fit Covid symptoms. Otherwise, walk ambulance. firefighters going houses groups, wearing masks initially. Asking stair chair someone walk. Like, guys, point March April ""wasn't airborne"" come one, stale air house someone coughing days. air. medics get sick right beginning this, otherwise police firefighters sicks outside work.  
 
Also, socially media group chats devil. shit get trouble. March seems far away way numbers going. can't come soon enough. called dreams guy.  extra unemployment benefits? $600 ended months ago state one got $300 probably lasted month backdated it. Also Canadian winter. Daylight hours come &amp; go shift work. commutes darkness. get lot sun. skin awesome. :P decided stop contact friend flouted coronavirus protocols entire pandemic. Every text message infuriates me, read laundry list places they‚Äôve been, people they‚Äôve visited, etc. need hit pause button seem different values priorities. It‚Äôs hard. Considering it‚Äôs American company, America pre-purchased first batch, Pfizer American manufacturing... yes think production probably would gone differently weren‚Äôt able sell back America covid‚Äôs nothing, liberal plot...

Then shortness breath? May? It‚Äôs like never happened there. Full malls full bars full restaurants Bless heart. thoughts prayers saint would continue endure this. I‚Äôm thankful people like keeping good fight Friends child even allowed opt person classes sports program. required person schooling included athletics class. opted online classes would kicked sports program guarantee spot available later. state full people Florida.

and average person hard time comprehending exponential growth. double $1 every day, takes 3 weeks million, 1 week 100 million. That‚Äôs unpopular opinion here. Reddit hates fat people hates covid Well Luke tell Vader told he'd die took mask off. Sorry people enjoy things dont like inevitable happens winter. vaccine help, little, late. never get socialist utopia know Trump GOP cooked labs, air dropped China?

New world order population control tin foil hat pandemic formula.  Quite true recruit people free early vaccination convenient time discuss health issues life situations Hopefully big easter. Governments really worried Christmas travel family gatherings try mitigate promising public holidays easter, St. John day similar occasion. size problem differs country country (different Covid situations different traditions), giving big public holiday would probably easier promised time future visit family. Maybe declare holidays reaching certain vaccination levels. 1. ethically extremely problematic 

2. alternative would trial dying anyway. way chance, sadly luck wasn‚Äôt side moderna one blame that. stupid online fitness trackers overestimate too. Whatever log walking 2mph try get calorie expenditure little realistic. convince families members actually take vaccine? believe it‚Äôs conspiracy Bill Gates China working together use vaccine track us. Please help explain fucking take thing it‚Äôs available. Oh, mean like currently insurance premiums? idea make pool larger costs lower.

Why people dense can't understand this? think one worst things could happened Covid Tom Hanks got early, recovered little problem, hosted SNL week two after. Like, get well intentioned nature trying keep people calm wonder many people would still Hanks croaked put fear God people regarding Covid. needed President Xi style lockdown beat virus. I'm pretty surprised protecting top. 95% effectiveness rate, strong direct protection well great protect others. thread makes want cry, tbh

Jesus humans vile know agree everything said, noticed constantly post weight. Part probably help others narrative ""your weight YOU"" (which think valuable information!) another reason may like attention, even negative. like hear ""YASSSS QUEEN!!"" comments large woman wants eat whatever want reject may making unwise unhealthy choices? they‚Äôve around  say all. took online nutrition class coursera whatever years back, interviewed adults obese Mexican family really know anything nutrition. realize drinking lots soda bad everyone never learned otherwise. looking red lines (the 7 day average) - average Midwest South (where 59% US cases are) clearly decreasing. also slight (though shortly smaller) decrease West.

In Midwest, 7 day average went 62,793 Nov. 20 53,043 Nov. 29. South went 50,381 Nov. 25 45,502 Nov. 29.

Time tell whether Thanksgiving-fueled surge, pretty clear cases decreasing.

If I'm missing something - reporting lag cases, etc., please let know. saw gas station last week friends say take it. said why..she said nanoparticles track alter dna cause side effects make feel ill.


I argue said oh damn real? Played stupid. honestly believe even go away end next year. Nobody's social distancing, wearing masks properly pulling talk nose out. Large gatherings continue like nothing You‚Äôre right, understand people‚Äôs fear. made peace risk, certainly US conducted unethical experimentation, especially POC women. Well there‚Äôs point we‚Äôve made vaccine we‚Äôre vaccinating medical staff next week hopes vaccinating adult population Easter  We‚Äôre going win much, you‚Äôre going sick tired winning. compounds natural ability, replace it. Maybe compensate wrong word. compensate people time expenses, done small flat payment (probably less $500 vaccine study), want pay participating study, since said coerce people joining without considering risks US 10th per capita confirmed deaths. US better supposedly enlightened countries Belgium, Italy, Spain, UK, etc. US response obviously good, true many countries. Let‚Äôs take chill pill relentless America bashing, thanks. definitely obese people go gym 4-5x week walk multiple miles day moderate strength training. people eat much unhealthy can't out-exercise poor diet. Amazing. trumps administrations utter financial corruption coming light day, and... nothing come it. Particularly concerning two ignorant comments defending it! 


There‚Äôs reason have, supposedly have, disclosures people divesting necessary. choice made best public? best individual whole lot gain? Eliminating possibility wishywashy shouldn‚Äôt taken lightly. what's known dupe tube friend. Try 3 diff chambers dryer sheets like square inside would tape one around exit tube one final filter opposed jamming there. Tends mask smell better imo. 16oz cans Surge various grocery stores gas stations, also get Coke Freestyle fountains Burger Kings.

They even Surge Zero Sugar Freestyles BK now. Yea, makes sense. Besides, like I've ever offered choice vaccine brands lol. ""Belgium"" making vaccines. sounds like extremely unhealthy lifestyle slowly killing you. case COVID prevention measures, negative changes lifestyle worse disease. thought moving on. make stuff up. According articles supplied China contacted NZ it. top Jacinda cant even bothered contacting them. would first thing would do. way China banned meat imports 20 countries, wounder NZ one them. paragraph suggests article ""Trading partners, including New Zealand, US, Canada European Union, say unclear China‚Äôs methodology seen solid evidence products carried virus. US questioned whether China‚Äôs crackdown scientifically based suggested bans may amount unfair trade barrier.""  indeprndant article says meat ""The Chinese city Jinan said weekend found COVID-19 beef tripe, packaging, Brazil, Bolivia New Zealand, two provincial capitals detected packaging pork Argentina."" worth, Washington Post says mRNA vaccines (Pfizer Moderna) require growing ingredients eggs.  Thanks clarification appreciate it. That's said wise decision would find better model. China? Prob people like you. South Korea? Vietnam (actually economic growth)? Singapore? Thailand (Bangkok much worse position London)? Laos? Cambodia? 

So many choose from... That's NYC. Cuomo discussing whole state, different infection rates. America like: im sorry insurance cant cover cost We're nowhere close point. hospitals city even canceled elective procedures yet. think regularly test level antibodies. it‚Äôs like didn‚Äôt get exposed covid they‚Äôd ok. I‚Äôm looking forward Trump throwing bus too. Gov Kemp went wheels; Barr too...eventually Mafia turns everyone. statistic vaccine prevents severe cases holds up, vaccinating high risk groups enough justify ending restrictions including mask mandates. people stop dying COVID-19 large numbers consequences increased case counts substantially reduced continued intervention necessary vaccinate rest population willing get vaccinated, potentially requiring proof vaccination travel. I'm going throw away shot. scientist skeptic myself. hope questions soon answered data released. Curfew starts tomorrow evening 21.00 going 2-day long weekend lockdown starting 21.00 friday 05.00 monday morning. think sensible decision considering healthcare system overburdened 29k+ new cases per day. Absolutely. environment like unvaccinated eventually enough receive effective, quick early testing, monoclonals need be. going fantastic curve-shifter. I'm counting days. start (hopeful) end however horrific pandemic been, scientific viewpoint it'll seen miracle am... well, less 4 months ago. working dietitan. Still ""early vaccine maybe"" group. :( neighbor too. Except mine crazy, anti-mask, conspiracy theory type guy. type guy always traps conversation want in. I'm afraid admit caught day discussing pandemic. best explain masks effective may fine getting it, pass someone else unknowingly. Well, goes ask I've ever gotten flu. know this, truth get bad every year so, despite getting vaccine. asked never wore masks Covid prevent part deadly flu transmission chain. truly loss. said know walked away. really wishing good answer lol Thank you, makes sense. remember discussion college pros cons legalizing paid organ donation, suppose ethical dilemma. Also another redditor pointed ""participate chance win"" studies could encourage participants provide bad data they're better compensated. It‚Äôs like Moderna injected COVID encouraged try get infected word ""may"" lot work sentence. need science wizard make predictions kind Yea anything $50 would get pretty heavily scrutinized research board. Even $20 likely require justification. least prior university. anyone else think timing really suspicious? Like Pfizer announces effective vaccine Moderna also announces? billions made vaccine, hope rushed market attempt get slice pie. I‚Äôm confused. slums India test 75% antibody rate rest world still peak cresting wave? I‚Äôm advocate quarantine, something isn‚Äôt adding up. Yea it‚Äôs large... that‚Äôs one factors density....density = mass/volume Same! see people life differently they've handled things year. frankly care close people think fun important others' safety lives, anyway. Thank you! reported surge related large groups gathering protest. Definitely don‚Äôt want diminish fact got vaccine promising results R&amp;D clinical trials. also- Pfizer one largest global pharma companies, employs something like ~90k people, something like one biggest sterile injection manufacturing facilities world (just one sites, also makes API large scale), like many large corporations -benefitted heavily corporate tax cuts 2017. 

Great promising vaccine coming, aren‚Äôt kid lemonade stand. tons cash resources something like without need government funds get going it. don‚Äôt think needs romanticized aside large pharma they‚Äôre capable of. already two weeks ago  don‚Äôt expect 1 2 11 Covid cases; expect dozens severe cases population tens thousands. approach would dismiss perfect vaccine would data. bleak, I'm sure even would it. Magical thinking goes incredibly long way shield people facing reality. know Q Anon anti-masker whose father law spent couple weeks hospital Covid still insists overblown flu. think father law finally convinced, almost died hanging crowded bars every night. Heeeeeere go thread: 

Vaccinate vulnerable!

No like that! Yeah there's always outbreaks job person works close him. said wore mask hopefully counted something. don‚Äôt want coerce poor people participating potentially dangerous research.

Most studies pay nominal amount essentially reimburse time expenses involved (like parking), it‚Äôs meant enough truly entice participation. imagine it‚Äôll like future (late 2021 beyond) they‚Äôll vaccinating people whichever one that‚Äôs available moment. I'm sincerely happy you. hoped marriage would make through. already rocky, COVID like spark ignited fire. already told people I'm visiting anyone who's vaccinated. Assuming healthy 35 group, probably wait bit. PCPs act like healthy anxiety suggested depression. They're statewide group, there's options, similar treatment general practitioners. zero mental problems, two conditions I've struggled twenty years exhibit signs depression and, such, went undiagnosed twenty years. fair though one super rare 3:100,000. somewhat agree you‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs sure-fire way know new vaccine technology, vaccine specifically, cause issues medium long term since reaching general population long term trials concluded. However, it‚Äôs likely long term effect straight death without immediate warning signs. look mortality rate letting covid go unhampered, rate long term health issues arising covid, effects like people‚Äôs livelihoods economy. done it, kinda obvious friend got placebo. injection site soreness reaction whatsoever.

Still hoping get sick... &lt;.&lt;' knew scale says BMI looked chart thought there's way look big. 

When found second graphic like, yeah... seems pretty accurate, unfortunately.

Edit: Fuck it. 37. THERE, SAID OUTLOUD. I'll sitting sleeves rolled next five months anyone feels like driving jabbing this. vaccine group size seem way small? seems could serious complications testing 11 people critical study. could serious complications people different ethnicities genetic compositions. Nobody cares. PR move hospital. awfully convenient people pick chose healthcare professionals listen account seriousness pandemic. I'll give hint: large part nurses doctors give shit masks sensationalist precautions, dumb enough post tiktok)) quarantined exposure enough get paid days CARES act. might good idea get tested shouldn‚Äôt get paid days. mom‚Äôs flu shot side effects debilitating. still gets vaccine, really dreads it. 

That said, think older people inclined groups rush get vaccine. Anyone 35 probably wait first couple waves (assuming wouldn‚Äôt need work). would choose state like Florida things get dicey could pay Governor declare essential business. WWE declared essential business day owners pledged spend $18.5 million PAC money state. think 49ers already concerned ban contact sports occurring county stadium is. saying kids spreading much adults. heard many cases like that. doubt would room number adults. Oddly years flu shot gave zero side effects. Literally nothing. years gets though didn‚Äôt focus asymptomatic, symptomatic. That‚Äôs say efficacy reduction symptoms, infection itself. 

It‚Äôs still unclear transmit virus even vaccination. damn pilgrims lazy work ethic. agree, true several months ago. government citizens care live die. next months selfish lives painter corner. sad conclusion; keep family safe fuck everyone else. able get long time. Logistically huge issue. Cold temps, limited production. Hopefully see this, oxford vaccine August. I'm sceptical vaccine requires cold temp transport. No. others said, DeBlasio wanted schools remain open Cuomo wanted gradual shut down. Cuomo understand exponential growth balloons short period time. ""Astrazeneca may able help."" Good news. Biden vaccine ready mRNA part genetic code. created DNA read ribosome. vaccine basically uses ribosome create virus protein particles immune system responds to. many people told already back 2019 would trust many anecdotes. That's drug likely gets approved FDA, interesting see resignations also see approved Europe. Common cold ones? Idk, I'm microbiology expert always told couple hundred different ""types"" common cold causing rhinoviruses always easier still somewhat safe take time work otc meds call day. 
 
Influenza however know deadly cold, vaccine people talk effectiveness percentages think pretty low last year? Anyway it'd interesting boosts that. getting close end point, couple promising vaccines Biden takes January experiencing constant poor decisions federal government.

People realize well suited government deal pandemic Trump came started changing country's policies ""just let people die"" thrilled pleased. pleased this? Healthcare providers also get early access well. dad's near 70 practices gynocology/OBGYN I'm worried So, priority given to.... 50% population? Eh, read checked it‚Äôs 50,000U. plurality Americans obese. one really call ""prioritizing"" 40% population? Pretty sure doctors nurses going either start demanding 1million per patient quit. get stuff care... continue care act like this? Fatten curve! starting get it! Wait till incorporate fact multiple tiers laws freedoms world view. fun! keep picturing news vaccine trials new treatment options Charge Rohirrim, gathering speed momentum prepare smash latest wave COVID. knew fight obesity! Hopefully vaccine coming soon drop vaccine already stop reading shit. Yes are, can‚Äôt quarantine thing, would rather Zoom Christmas potentially get family member sick possibly kill them. Europe, yes. U.S., reporting anomoly due holiday.   Well, managed narrow 150 million people second wave vaccines. J\w. Would say feel comfortable unmasked crowds, going crowded restaurants, things considered taboo pandemic? still cautious? 

My whole family masks including 5 1 year olds, nice walk around paranoid people noses chin diapers. Eating crowded restaurants, etc.  aware small children ways vaccine though. 2 successful vaccines, think safe bet. Damn, yeah makes sense. Although I‚Äôve operations past like nose cases I‚Äôve able sleep hell may lucky. others responded, responded well past flu vaccines person person thing seems likely. guess we‚Äôll find out! Exciting.  ""Actual medical science"" completely ignored study two Americans (one Harvard educated Vilhjalmur Stefansson) 1930 lived hotel one entire year constant scientific scrutiny eating meat. problems whatsoever. 

What good limiting one's self ""actual medical science"" ""actual medical science"" ignores healed lot went carnivorous. 100% carnivorous 2.5 years. ketovore. let fear drive someone else's unscientific opinions, I'm going proactively go looking healthy look confirmation. New normal crew shambles. even talking privileged? I'm essential worker who's work first second lockdown. going large gatherings spreading virus, jeopardizing life family's lives bring virus workplace put food table.

It seems like one who's privileged flouting rules. just, know, wash Let break comment obviously to. says can't keep going without seeing mom. means traveling. Obviously read headline states highest numbers since May, clearly indicates still pandemic ""outside."" Apparently you, outside, whatever means. point is, seen mom almost year half. Considering follow CDC guidelines wearing mask, sanitizing hands, staying 6 ft apart. mean still declined travel see family? long? pandemic ""outside"" goes 3 years passes time. means last 3 years life unable see her, make sense me. protect everyone, denied travel within country citizen United States. terminology ""banana cray"" politely saying opinion, pandemic fatigue real fucking bullshit others continue ignore CDC guidelines cause numbers increase means travel ban regulations go effect again, denied travel due stupidity others. great day. every American, moment protect family,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúSo governor mayor isn‚Äôt policies know critical ‚Äî masking, physical distancing, avoiding bars, avoiding crowded indoor areas ‚Äî restrictions don‚Äôt exist state, need take upon restricted. need go places. need protect family now.‚Äù mix communication US schools role well J&amp;J one one shot trials haven‚Äôt completed yet They're probably going anything... worst part. probably worried neighbor finding reported them. sad lives risk definitely worth something for. What‚Äôs changed causing coronavirus daily deaths quickly decline? restrictions working? literally says article 30 placebo group severe covid. Stop lying. whole thing brought worse suicidal ideation I've ever experienced life. community several young people killed themselves. I'm sure nationally rates up.  teething ring something unpacked baby might chew on, would thank gift store garbage can. Zoom parties worst though lol. Think able sleep sick. Nothing more. slept well night that. 

Like said, clear schedule next day case. Worth getting mental health day Read study last week 8 months still tcell activity Good point. Actually wasn‚Äôt worried post election civil war. Americans complacent ever anything like that. agree. I've posts removed stating facts w/o ""incivility,""  don‚Äôt want die; want live lives without interfered get sick get sick, sore throat light cough decided stay home thanksgiving. First thanksgiving spent alone. dad prostate cancer figured I‚Äôd rather little longer potentially lose stupid virus that‚Äôs affecting planet. Call us Surgis governor refuses absolutely anything save single life thinks would hurt base donors. Yes absolutely 100%. Profits people. Nurses limited training science medicine. majority training take care patients. Hence statistically likely physician antivax, promote essential oils, afraid covid, etc. Great stuff!! functional government would start putting information, commercials, even f'in town halls right help assuage concerns public. frankly matter concerns reasonable founded point... exist. So, public information campaign assure people might lot good. 

I strong feeling see one loudest voices room ones objections. sad see fellow americans shrug death hundreds thousands neighbors misinformation, partisanship lies. like lost patriotism replaced politicism I‚Äôm wondering people get reaction vaccines? get flu shot every year, minimal soreness goes away day. people generally adverse reactions? Dude, help brother out. much take? Like said, vaccine reactions totally vary person person. likely much reaction. 

Though shoulder fucking hurt. consistent recent college grad, never able handle online classes. two took huge struggle me, without structure person environment, wasn‚Äôt motivated accountable myself. learned online classes don‚Äôt work me, took person classes.

If still school right now, would one failing students slipping cracks sure. everyone like you. Bingo! family said Thanksgiving already starting make Christmas plans. told parents anyone outside immediate family attending I'll staying home alone. think life potentially saved, takes priority people acquired condition. anyone, reason concidered ""high risk"" go front line. saving lives, putting agendas front medicine, got bad begin with. allowed massive Christmas parties...as long it‚Äôs Zoom postponed later date it‚Äôs safe, everyone quarantines 14 days home hotel room within driving distance without stops gathering location .

So don‚Äôt excuse there. 14 day quarantine guests, Zoom, postponing 3 options give excuse unsafe party now. person buys car keep job, maybe loses job due lockdown runs money pay car...or get covid lose job/money cant pay car due medical expenses. think answer bit black white side.

More mentioned. That's point trials.... they're clear proof drug works approved, placebo people told got placebo. drug becomes standard care drugs compared to. I'm paranoia regulations anyone.

However, something stupid about. refreshing take ‚Äî know billionaires athletes movie stars influencers get early, often talked disgust. favoritism going happen matter Reddit thinks; least bright side it, public sees Mark Zuckerberg Patrick Mahomes favorite Insta model getting staying healthy, help convince people vaccine safe.

I mean probably feels good write things like ‚Äúgrocery workers get first!‚Äù that‚Äôs world live in. world live in, public health benefit letting elite skip line. able sleep... hoping that‚Äôs everyone can‚Äôt stand lack sleeping. It‚Äôs worth given that‚Äôs ideal side effect. whatever percent us left taking seriously isn‚Äôt meaningless. However small may feel. seem like hope save house COVID. Siting house. Praying don‚Äôt need medical help next 3 months. Watching population get ravaged. well could be, usually fun reaction shots.

That said, flu wasn‚Äôt bad year, 2 years ago weirdly rough  Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* wonder would happen Australians saw 100+ deaths per day (roughly equivalent current US numbers). Sky News would probably say we're gonna get pandemic faster, lol. people get vaccine! Fine. Bloods hands then. least healthcare workers won‚Äôt sacrifice themselves. Honestly, people I've noticed worst staying home nursing friends. snapchats almost always full partying hanging large groups without masks. really disheartening. time, mental health low right they're trying cope. Something actually would make sense. puts Trump top list... Aaaaaoo!! Yes study, severe cases placebo, 30. significant. 

Though sample size little small claim 100%, safe say 95% even small sample size. Phew, toxic. Grow up. IMO, he's probably programmer. Dude posted 6 month old data CDC another post without even checking header. way he's actively employed meteorologist, is, long. level intellectual laziness pretty fatal careers. 

Easy way get rude: Dont spread bullshit. lie people. simple. fact youmcant even make low bar fucking pathetic. Think property ownership records something simple like spokeo.com would provide info... many vaccines needles arm. never side effects even remotely debilitating, barely even uncomfortable. I‚Äôm 140 pounds. Reactions vaccines person person friend. blood relatives intense side defects doesn‚Äôt mean need buy shares aluminum mining companies, stat. Everybody gonna buying pole feats strength. bet reduced numbers along whole west coast Definitely. side effects common doubt ever get enough people vaccinated reach herd immunity. hahaha, Florida far cheap. I'm stuck living folks. true. true. restaurant last night (tented flap one side open sat right airflow.)

We all,socially distanced small parties. sudden put 3 tables together walks huge party twenty. w masks, without, hugging etc. quickly got check took horrified ignoring max six people disappointed people could still stupid. step kid got covid visiting mom. refused get tested would make real. Instead went babysat someone else's kids went Thanksgiving entire family. knew kid tested positive, too. least refused go. real talk guys gonna strike what? American public clearly doesn‚Äôt give shit help guys. hate say ones help yourselves. even question? Deaths probably peak right after. consider morons that:

- Survived thanksgiving, think they're invincible Christmas
- Cancelled thanksgiving, decided they're going cancel 2 holidays, Christmas celebrated

The worst disease occur Mid-January. 

***

Prediction: due falling death rates, media hold back reporting worst disease. Again, mid-January. inauguration, worst disease behind us, media accused going soft Biden handling pandemic. Cries ""manufactured panic"" grow. Concern trolling rules. tossup whether mods enforce it, unfortunately. Regardless, fact engage pathetic. Oxford/AstraZeneca's vaccine. Completely different trial. Moderna one dosage. Vaccine side effects vary person person one person's ""it kept night!"" could easily another's ""it felt like cold day."" People different reactions people also wildly different pain/sickness tolerances.

Oh, react strongly vaccine side effects chances getting COVID would even worse. take advice learn comprehend written words  sample size assessed, rutabaga. really think that's true. return part, least, vaccinated people return, rest risk getting infected. 20% population vaccinated, another 20-25% infected, absolutely going HUGEE hit transmission rates point cases likely drop rapidly. Disappear completely? No, think would ever spread pandemic level like 2020. Nice! thread literally place /r/coronavirus people rational conversations anymore. They‚Äôre going remove post I‚Äôm breaking rules. üòä kind funky think received vaccine placebo woukd lived. Also, wonder put higher risk thought may received vaccine instead placebo. wonder anyone underlying heart conditions took vaccine. SVT I‚Äôm kind scared get it. Dear lord people absolutely bonkers We've known long time immune response long lasting. body trained recognize virus produce antibodies. I'm wondering people got infected antibodies high play antibodies low body needs produce again.

It's difference facing army that's already prepared. Vs factory churn warriors army quickly. can't numbers nothing regularly see employees stores mask. It‚Äôs insane  basically said? People generally going put knife profit. diagnostics going fudged. People forgetting people. Tons handful millions infections. basically negligible  could so, case prove breaking rules work, fire that. can't found guilty based speculation. question is, percentage Americans actually take vaccine. I'm guessing maybe 60-70% far low. people get dedicated time children get dedicated time winter break, especially travel see family, logistics scheduling lot easier make work people. We're going seeing much larger numbers cases deaths, real hope larger numbers virus getting personal people start knock sense people. far evidence vaccines pose danger initial side-effects, non-life-threatening. hand, KNOW Covid-19 fatality rate 1.5% 9.5% depending location. deploy vaccine face odds would irresponsible. Yes, Pfizer already said going produce K-Zoo. biggest facility capacity, would borderline criminal to. It‚Äôs interesting. I‚Äôm going sex wife later tonight. say all. Exactly! long SHES fun wants COVID can‚Äôt touch her. Smh. She‚Äôs nightmare mechanism vaccines work essentially same, would actually expected would similar efficacy. Can't confirm - zombie now.


But seriously - I'll line vaccine available me. Florida pretending shit exist. hate living here. people upvoting this?

There going 2 vaccines U.S. Christmas, Pfizer Moderna one, assuming FDA ok's them, seems highly likely.  bummer. realize told may may given saline, step up, go that, learn either:

- got saline
- vaccine effective

And slip mortal coil thought - gotta suck. me, I'd thinking ""oh god, work. many going end like me."" (as slip lucidity, go right paranoia). Yeah that's point, there's point going elimination time achieve vaccine kicking anyway. Makes sense, thanks explaining. seems like middle pandemic, people willing provide consent get injected vaccine injected covid help accelerate safe effective vaccine, way get around hippocratic oath. get ""do harm"" intent, though tons people dying life know pure chaos...? 

However, recent news, guess matter, though I'm wondering effective vaccine could come market sooner tested somehow way suggested? hospital hit full capacity often last 3 months we‚Äôre relatively small suburban/semirural city that‚Äôs mostly middle upper middle class (wealth plays huge factor access regular healthcare). That‚Äôs interesting point! hadn‚Äôt even considered participants trying figure got real vaccine not. you‚Äôre right made riskier anything that‚Äôs good news far effectiveness since anything weights non control towards exposure! I'm vaccine denier, curious know phase 3 trials Pandemix looked like...specifically many people included trial We‚Äôve known months immunity long lasting, likely several years. question immunity actually stops person getting infected keeps person getting sick. 

That won‚Äôt answered awhile, ‚Äúsevere covid‚Äù likely table. 

Mild cold likely table several months. real one inject veins please! people breaking rules makes hard break rules masters forced litterbox, choice! Meanwhile sheeple cats go right along using litterboxes without questioning it. yet another low point countries' priorities last years flu shot... year ZERO pain. never strategy based achieving herd immunity allowing better let seep slowly.** keep control take care harm society necessary. like forest fires things, **if make burn little slowly carefully, make burn out**. 

[Anders Tegnell, 16 March Swedish constitution allow lock downs, never option Sweden begin with. 

Two points: First, matter, FHM following science? need excuses lockdown scientifically correct thing do.

Second: told Swedish people follow FHM recommendations law. means FHM could simply recommended voluntary lockdown (if all) Swedish people would complied... Anyone drawing final conclusions results middle pandemic full shit. 

You fell airplane 10,000 feet without parachute, drawing conclusions hit ground stupid. mean miracle could happen... right? really sucks.

I used work hospital. Say, Healthcare workers like everyone else-- many awesome, science minded folks assholes idiots too. Nurses, doctors, respiratory therapists...
I know taking seriously either even though work front lines. ones know also racist classist say terrible things people serve tend feel deserve ailments black, poor, bring fat, etc.

It's disgusting. part left world started teaching. hope enjoy it! think meant genereal hopes healtch care public service people get vaccine December. That's also said Europe example. Except people likely spread it, would take vaccine I'd want earlier. Yea, Healthcare workers fucking useless vaccine. Let's completely disregard them. private business show naked person billboard without people's consent they're private business can't subject regulations individual can't?!

Private businesses free sexually harass public reason individuals allowed either. public beaches Europe thing culturally acceptable legal, still sexually harassing people would demand state steps ban personally problem it?!

Going nude beach know people nude sexual harassment. know they'll nude thus consent viewing nudity go.

Are really obtuse? topless woman wondering round shopping mall photoshoot, much consignation uproar shoppers children, fine personally problem it?!

If they're mall, whoever owns seem consistent all.

Because twisting ass backwards trying come retarded inconsistencies agree with. lol.

Use brain, big brain. 100%!!! try election results changed f. Sounds like something check :) I'll give watch weekend! long split guys randomly control vaccine groups still comparing apples apples. Even overall cautious sample, enough got placebo vaccine still got covid make useful comparison got real vaccine. I‚Äôll concede pin me. bad TJ take pandemic set grocery pickup system. Maybe area customer base skews young could certainly thrived online pickup joint. said far in-store shopping goes going beyond, really grocery store I'm comfortable setting foot moment. Virtually every hospital adding capacity can. Look local hospital icu capacity online, preferably last year. look recent reported census percent utilization, algebra, see local expansion is. use formula state level that's easier find. wasn‚Äôt selfish assholes, wouldn‚Äôt problems. math off.

First all, everyone would get vaccine (100%), part population would get virus -- moment around 10-15% countries, possibly never reach 100%, rate even reach 30% would take another year so.

So vaccine, multiply side effect probability number people, virus number infected people times death rate medical knowledge state. (As time progresses, better better treatment protocols enacted, decrease mortality.)

Current best estimate covid IFR 0.02% 20-49 years, 0.54% 70+ years according CDC: far know &lt;0.001% side effect rate true people vaccinated mRNA based vaccine.

Maybe is. Maybe right, safe. want test, want bet gamble. what? 0.02% mortality general age population? Yeah 11 comes much larger sample size never even got symptoms.... Starting take Battle Berlin energy. Everyone knows soon-to-be over, reason, dawning reality induces even greater death suffering. Mask burning parties insane. Actually college started online branch fall tuition 1/3 normal tuition. yeah, we're trying flexible wherever possible. hear argument - understand it.

All ask, flip head see perspective. 

What rare side effects *from virus* know yet? like chicken pox - lies dormant come back something else 30 years (shingles). 

We know long term side effects either yet....but would rather take chances vaccine. truly frankly hope they‚Äôre wrong. mix match vaccines, ones need two doses? Like, I'm wondering supplies shippings work. going try keep consistently one supply per city sending out? They'll get it. Risk take precedent age. healthy 50 year old get priority immunocompromised 30 year old. I‚Äôm horrified this. ICU half covid isolation right acuity care significantly higher logistical issues proper isolation protocol taking care covid positive patients, tend domino effect organ systems. anxiety damn high right now. got lot problem people year! Lol love this. cardiac patient, normal O2 sats 100% (98-100%), vulnerable number reasons, course, oxygen important less efficient normal-born person distributing body. **I still wear mask**.

My cousin healthy 50-something, aside (I believe) ex-smoker. He's extremely political ""my freedumbs"" rallying cry. facebook friends go about:

- severe respiratory problems
- know better pulmonologists (Exact quote: ""You would think pulmonologist would know dangerous masks are, can't even write note wear one"")
- one big soros conspiracy. 

Thing - much willing bet:

- sleep small rooms partner door shut ventilation
- occasionally sleep faces buried pillows underneath blankets
- still smoke. 

It's purely political thing jerks. nothing well, healthy, anything like that. saw leader downplayed thing, media gave lots exposure individuals something address it. 

So chose side. one anti-science (but second science-based recommendations change based new evidence, suddenly they're arms important science is). RIP one passed someone still think virus black white only, life death months. tons well documented cases effects covid really affect life. Stop misinformation.  use pole decoration. tinsel. feats strength. disappoint me. Amy reason taken yet? Well, working, already 2 highly effective vaccines, coming. Keep up! Stop spamming this.

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* think things good substitute physical human contact? already said home dont know people suffering with. they've along, including times lead super-spreader events White House previously.

[It's known since October strategy work look forward movie they'll make Fauci someday. Hero scientist tiresly working save people ignore and/or undermine efforts. They'll line front lot nurses.

I'm nurse work Ina direct covid unit (although still frequently get covid patients) fully expect hospital fuck giving administrators rich patients me. take care lot local pro athletes fully expect get jab me. probably educate vaccine trials actually work spout nonsense. Immunocompromised folks come mind. everyone else *should* get vaccine lest knowingly make decision leads someone's death.

Sadly, US..."
