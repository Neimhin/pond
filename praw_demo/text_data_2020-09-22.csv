Cool hope immunity lasts long time everyone died nothing Could less wore masks. Less.

They're also averaging 300 new cases day.  never real lock-down, people still gathered whatever like. US cultural problem. politicise everything, right gender sex. Nothing gets done everything gets turned huge fight sides pitted other.

Masks, vaccines, pandemic, drugs, school, grades; everything political weapon. this, find cheap ultrasonic welding Chinese-made masks snap 1/3 time. Thats one many things absolutely blows mind. 

He is, without doubt, least ""man's man"" president longest time. He's prissy little rich boy never grew up. Never worked day life constantly crying playing victim. putting people jail, fines. fucked economy even ( possible idk). Good enough killed ? Aren‚Äôt masks actually mandatory public areas Nova Scotia? New Brunswick made call recalled day. always get wrong like even matters. follow science see science getting wrong every year, ok Closer still far far away. Yes got physical, travelled 15 states summer. Meeting family thanksgiving, beach vaaction Christmas.

 people outside coastal cities returned back normal. lot articles lockdown causing deaths. makes sense....reduced access healthcare, reduced mental health etc.


[one American calls non-wealthy country \*300\* times less cases per day per capita America pathetic.

Hilarious.

Absolutely hilarious. know kool-aid Trump feeding you, clearly working.

Honestly, believe whatever bullshit makes happy though. Fuxk. Quick question. wife school teacher, teaching person. student test posting Covid today. Last time saw student last Thursday. showing symptoms home (two kids) aside allergy stuff. recommended quarantine us. could sleep little ones room little one could sleep me. sure it‚Äôs overkill. certain do.

Everyone masked school. basically imagine someone tries travel NJ, book hotel flight something see ‚Äútravel advisory; must quarantine X days face fine‚Äù, etc: yeah maybe ton people won‚Äôt give shit gives 50% travelers pause enough change plans hell even 20% change mind don‚Äôt come then, well, still helps. costs nothing helps bit even need vaccine? Texas honestly cant even tell covid. Maybe mask - thats People different wave emotional state. sucks. sorry!

When health insurance grad school, care insurance agent told make sure accidents around car b/c car insurance would pay. I've forgotten reason why...She fell broke arm near car got covered car insurance. try fall around car!

Good luck! Exactly. would rent to, make business loan to. Someone 0 experience, someone proven businesses plan got screwed Covid-19? completely mostly quite places including Wuhan. may come back cases moment. Lot beach trips planned. Mexico Carribean open minimal restrictions. headline hospitalizations, ICU patients. need reading comprehension class. Jesus. Corona waves like hobbit breakfasts. Thank service 80 year old 16 year old shop grocery store? go physician? 

Infectious disease team sport. You‚Äôre never *only* making decisions yourself. One might say it‚Äôs patriotic. Maybe would better kids forgot 2020 Halloween happen instead always remembering Halloween every house sort contraption give candy without near them. I'm parent kid once, forget boring stuff remember weird stuff. 

Just 2 cents. Americans really dense care?  Yes understand that, false sense security? wearing masks makes people feel closer 6ft safe Lmao China eradicated virus news. Virus still rounds . said August. also said Sweden hit herd immunity April. 

‚ÄúFace masks complement things things safely place,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúBut start face masks think crowd buses shopping malls ‚Äî that‚Äôs definitely mistake.‚Äù

He completely brushed prospect wearing masks last month, saying, ‚ÄúWith numbers diminishing quickly Sweden, see point wearing face mask Sweden, even public transport.‚Äù Honestly asking, saying enough people die week equal 9/11 deaths √ó2? statistics true, that's horrible $400 $6000 fine wearing mask required 250K deaths includes 200K confirmed COVID deaths thankfully bad.

Interestingly, couple researches show height epidemic NY, COVID worse Spanish Flu. I‚Äôm coastal New Brunswick moment essentially don‚Äôt exist public areas I‚Äôve (compared home city). went grocery stores even staff weren‚Äôt wearing masks.

I don‚Äôt much hope Atlantic bubble bursts. saving grace may rural areas actually are. Hello, rocket science, countries figure many Americans still refuse right thing protecting saving lives others come contact with?ü§îüö∑üöëüò¢ kept *you* people whose news source Fox OANN outlets without shred journalistic integrity. upsets *us*, want see country get back normal children‚Äôs lives pawns perverse political game. People‚Äôs lives absolutely destroyed... 200,000 counting dead, tens millions work. Millions business closed permanently. Parents forced choose putting food table leaving kids home alone work. Trump decided politicize wearing masks, contradict undermine administrations scientists, leave entire response states figure own. even people appear sick danger people? I'm referring pandemic. Look case Typhoid Mary.

If infected anything contagious, need stay away people forcibly held back willingly comply - even show symptoms seemingly good health. Yessir, place hour away Toronto! Peterborough.

We mostly good, believe - elderly pretty brutal since dominate populace - split college university numbers.

What meaning, going groceries essentials. loved going movies can't bring it, we've switched ordering groceries online disinfecting. number times older folks, (This one old woman WORST Giant Tiger,) squeezed pleading stop. ask one old lady mentioned, please back three times scoffed laughing squeezed cut line. said ""I've long enough."" ended giving shove asking nicely again, got pissy; staff kicked customers backed up. tried say something avail, either.

My problem dad high risk every category health complications years back, he's left way lower lung function even common cold could kill him... extra precautionary me, since move back home two years ago stepped film animation company. mean, COVID scary... there's much worry about.

I large friend group around 15 people years talk daily, game daily, stream movies together, etc. also arranged hangouts throughout year friend's cottage able plan self quarantine. able stuff, plan like solo camping way limited people. COVID numbers good here, getting flu season... family treat like COVID now, past 5 years.

If I'm honest, breaks heart; expect people like father survive people smarten up. That's mentioned heart goes south border us, there's others like father breaks heart. actually masks helped even common cold us. :\\

I beyond happy kind person produces music, develops video games, animates, writes, etc. Even depression anxiety, I've learned control - I'm things COVID mental health affected whatsoever! 


EDIT: Also, name fucking hilarious giving suggestion. +1 friendship. Haha well thing coronavirus here. Can't say disagree Yep that‚Äôs true. Hopefully leave noses hanging don‚Äôt allergies runny noses leaking place. 

But understand contraception fails happen people don‚Äôt seem understand concept using mask signage everywhere covering nose, mouth chin. 7 day rolling average. put numbers 3 months ago disingenuous misleading don‚Äôt really see difference though treat treating getting take grocery shopping. It‚Äôs definitely lower risk grocery shopping Walmart. letting kids it? No. real danger gonna idiots hosting Halloween parties. cases starting uptick Sweden? sub seems like it‚Äôs full delusional schizophrenics. don‚Äôt doubt people experience Covid related difficulties even ‚Äúrecovering‚Äù, sub place people share anxiety-filled thoughts. population's attitude incomprehension bigger problem government UK now.

It would make sense countries lock significantly closer herd immunity ones did. immunity virus naturally developed.  Exposer! began lockdown march ended july-august. Wtf expecting, destroy economy till people die starvation? harsh lockdown what's compliance rate? It‚Äôs also totally unrealistic expect. Vaccines massively effective antiviral. antiviral market virus much impact hoping for. mean, flu kills 60k Americans every year. Mask wearing would definitely make dent that.

Should institute every flu season? #TRUMPS WIENER SMALL! CLICK LINK SEE What? read science all? risk minimal even handed you. fact, there's proof surface transmission... ever. WAY dangerous things allowed trick treating. Unless eat wrapper someone sneezed high viral load, MAYBE even then...

You really think you‚Äôre going nuke country *literally shares longest land border earth* and...you think good idea?

I knew people stupid didn‚Äôt realize you‚Äôre fucking dumb. first point mentioned. 94% death certificates physician wrote mechanism action (i.e. pneumonia etc.) caused COVID death certificate comorbities. 6% death certificates physician wrote COVID without writing mechanism death. course purposefully misinterpreted spread misinformation. could beaten aging achieving eternal youth are. Sweden dreaming nonsense. city primary schools closed it‚Äôs college town, colleges open person. biggest university released statement saying proactive social distance, mask wearing ect know students responsible. live near campus every weekend everyone partying, least 300 college students partying front lawns past weekend alone. masks, nothing. wish could fucking sue colleges spreading Covid community worry will. Well Fauci lied us effectiveness masks like N95, one blame. America mean letting unskilled people(even though already allow entire world). Myocarditis found people flu. condition panic over. bad fortune -- intentional malevolence! appreciate lot Fauci done, never forgive downplaying need masks beginning express purpose enough medical workers. could made own, doing. masks homemade. helped cause lot damage damn lie. post one, argentina getting fucked covid. locked 4-6 months. wtf rationale ? like know why

Pass. think first trickle-down boy scout play aggressively dumb drop condescending lecture first sign someone's patience wearing thin? 

Pedants stroking 'civil discourse' act older usenet. Get new material. Mind fucking body manners, asshole. CDC‚Äôs failure. proven absolute joke. thinking poor people attacked snd executed makes want vomit. really going hell handbasket. make covid without everyone going completely feral, there'll still shrinking resources due climate change make people even vicious. üò¢ shit, they're protect someone sneezing face.   Well I‚Äôm academic watching friends lose jobs. schools talking about. It‚Äôs happening Marquette, Miami Ohio, Loyola, u cinci, northwestern, u Chicago, CSU, Boston u, u Arizona, u mass, go on?

Both go back setting standards moving goal posts (watch fast EMA argument drops agree FDA).

Thankfully people aren‚Äôt extremes usually. Hopefully stays way corrects back there‚Äôs actually something pick guys got nukes? No? Ok masking distancing necessary thing long time come.... year, half LSU tested positive, least 30 West Virginia Clemson. big deal age group. flu deadly (and flu gives heart issues...it's big deal long term). comment deleted. guess mods decided see comment. could asked back claims, would happy do.

Trust me, us trying best. hunkering since March it‚Äôs annoying fuck family actually takes seriously wears god damn mask social distance. annoying right way many ass hats say fuck feels like we‚Äôre family means nothing worthless. know family basically said hell one else taking seriously it‚Äôs lost cause went one back normal.

Awww maaan member rural Wisconsin, farmers refuse give right wear mask stop going bars. Mostly men ages 40-65 beer guts sports/Nascar shirts. intentionally provoke arguments exercise ""muh liberty!""

Trust me, us trying best. Symptoms long outlast infection unfortunately. 14 days, unlikely he's contagious. guy deserves sympathy, avoidance. Good job North Dakota. Nothing else number one at, might well make COVID cases September. flu deaths measured excess deaths people flu died flu (e.g. fever pneumonia caused influenza).

Instead, flu often leads complications allowing diseases take hold, ones actually kill you.

For example, US sources say Italy something like 27k flu deaths (I forget exact number, sake argument, let's assume 10k per year). Italy tracks every death caused flu. Per week 200 worst week, tracked less half year trends towards 0 summer. actual deaths caused someone experiencing flu symptoms probably closer 2k.

Yet without flu, 8-25k probably developed diseases heart attacks. Still, directly attributable flu way getting pneumonia COVID19 is. accurately measured excess deaths COVID19 yet.

So 30-60k numbers hear flu mostly indirect. There's people die flu itself, even would likely survived year flu. Unfortunately classroom situation, majority often punished misbehavior small percentage.  US still pretend COVID exist 6 months in

[As US neared 200,000 Covid deaths, Trump claimed ‚Äúaffects virtually nobody‚Äù](As US neared 200,000 Covid deaths, Trump claimed ‚Äúaffects virtually nobody‚Äù) LOL troll  It‚Äôs disagreeing, it‚Äôs rejecting science work people dedicated field study.

Some appeals heard de-novo, one looks like kind appeal would decided whether trial judge abused discretion. Burden proof government curtailing freedoms.  apples oranges approach, gatherings percentage occupancy limitations, whereas activities numeric cap -the government explain that, didn't.     
I think they're better crafting new policy overcomes problems trial judge found current policy. govt colleges fault? Thanks much this!

The area, specifically Ithaca, leans extremely democratic (due college students). compared literally everywhere else around leans republican (farmers like). literally surrounded people denying whole thing altogether. students there, place large city overrun hill billys (other students stay year round) going Walmart like. school time flips complete opposite. super bizarre experience.

Funny story that. main road center Ithaca decades called State Street (since formed actually). basically backbone downtown Ithaca. Around 2008 petition went rename Martin Luther King Blvd. horror long time local residents went through. local push back compromise made rename half (iirc). insane witness first hand really divide place was. two groups somehow live codependent harmony without much issue, 90% time.

Anyways, parents older (67 79) keep begging come visit (Utica) keep denying them. much safer staying area coming coming visit.

I overjoyed, even smiles waves ""oohs"" ""ahs"" distance inside car. you, whatever within safe limits. Canadian here. haven‚Äôt heard anyone say this. Far everything nothing. Covid affected many people far. Yes widespread numbers huge, proportion still low.

Still good time get mask on. None second wave, especially New Zealand Finland, comes close Sweden's current daily numbers. countries also avoided excess deaths Sweden seen.

Calling inevitable there's literally data support assertion ridiculous. Thanks clarification. difference Sweden people themself decide want stay home, ordered authorities. That's not... accurate. KN95 standard GB2626 masks meeting it. problem China despite authoritarian government actually pretty bad regulating industries. downplaying dangerous misinformation - read said. Risks managed mitigated long understood people aware this. Eating restaurants not, itself, high risk - customers staff behave makes so. Also, people eat restaurants likely risk-averse overall, eating restaurant risky, behaviour way there, evening before, on? need consider actions within context, identify risks involved manage them. *Don‚Äôt whole sub dedicated bashing Sweden past 6 months. dime many times I‚Äôve seen statement ‚ÄúSweden America Europe‚Äù... well no, it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs full paranoid/unstable/insane people don‚Äôt follow rules.

That said, diners would susceptible eating talking, hence mask. might actual ones. real problem ones sold online typically counterfeits. going ""Children men"" apocalypse scenario...well shit. part title lie? doesn‚Äôt much definitive. Cries American see.

Well, that‚Äôs confounding. agree point view.  
Although ignorant. Hindustan Times. One reputed newspaper India. weird publisher looks like Russian bot. I've using KN95 masks produced Chinese factory usually produce masks. made masks side workers could reopen factory continue usual production. say, way verify efficacy masks. 

However, wildfire smokes hit Bay Area, masks made huge difference. Mask off? Smell ash. Mask on? smell all. I'd like think still pretty effective,even maybe N95-level-effective.

It clear lockdowns caused millions suffer, shame millions care flaunted reduced effectivity prolong issue. flu must considered another comorbidity. could seen coming?!?!?! That‚Äôs problem overwhelming majority one side scale doesn‚Äôt give shit others, encourages others believe hoax wear masks. ‚ÄúIf *you* don‚Äôt feel safe, *you* stay home‚Äù might well catch phrase good evidence doctors (at least white ones) give demographics lower quality care likely make negative assumptions.

I believe lot cases opposite true. People different races genders trust healthcare providers race/gender, far less compliant providers race/gender. solution course, get diversity healthcare system, tall order. point towards ""medical advice"" Twitter. 

He means search Twitter want read ANECDOTAL cases exactly like one depicted comment above.

Why subreddits regarding covid cases everyone go doctor take treatment? everyone commenting tell others story covid, they're doctors, ""unverified"" twitter platforms people start tell stories. 

Yes, ok, subreddit news only. user gave account personal experience (the Paris case friend friend), she/he post news article man suggested others similar stories looked twitter. makes sense user responded!

Searching twitter stories cases patients valid way searching anecdotal evidence? Ok, reddit filled types threads, people sharing ""stories"". ALMOST DISEASES. one's doctor either platforms among tell others symptomatology, treatment etc. Except maybe thread r/askadoctor. 

I get it, user spams group posts limited, thing searching internet patient stories information half health threads reddit based upon everyone does, reddit deceiving twitter, would twitter worse? social media platform? Certain gacha addicts would find irony funny here. mean? ***Bait excellent quality.*** ~~‚Äúsuper AIDS.‚Äù~~ herpaghonnasyphilaids

FTFY like asking dumb questions ‚Äúbro‚Äù? Yesterday stabbed customer death asshole. Turns died comorbidity, fault!

/s Still inevitable? shit great, dude. Love considered talking mental health professional? okay okay. healthcare system hold up? claiming oh it‚Äôs cold/flu

Just reinforce, even killed many flu does, done half world lockdown, social distancing, wearing surgical masks.

Imagine road toll got 5-10 times worse half much traffic, people driving 10mph, cars wrapped shock absorbing bubble wrap sort. perform 415 quadrillion computations second, recently found face masks made non-woven fabric effective blocking spread Covid-19 via airborne droplets made cotton polyester

Was common sense? so? Ya definitely looked big picture whatsoever anything regarding covid lockdown matter usually avoid like proved, got ;-)

""Honestly"" look ""right now"" especially serves political agenda muhahahah! 

Seriously though stick topic stop nonsense strawman interjection response 2nd time. 

But since opened guess lets roll. course I've looked bigger picture inherently apparently think done that. 

Here let's look experiences together see come with. 2 random people never interacted before.

May ask questions? proceed. 

1. Covid 19?

2. many people know personally died it? 
2a.how many people pre existing health conditions/elderly?

And Question 3. many people know personally died due added complications lockdown brought lives? 
3a. many people personally witnessed suffer due lockdown vs many seen suffer recovering Covid. 

Want start? I'll happy :-) people still using numbers?

Seriously. this? Congratulations Asia! Keep up! I'm UK one trend that's reported here, due NHS *national*, things standardised. One hospital develops improvement process comes across specific set circumstances treated specific way, gets rolled across country. rising tide lifts boats, were. Whereas US piecemeal. Forget state state, even hospital hospital numbers wildly variable processes standards quality care place.

Jeez, Giesecke again! 
He's hidden architect Swedens herd immunity strategy.

With ten times many deaths neighbor countries lof Covid longhaulers even close herd immunity one go route. 


We still know long term effects covid best careful.


There estimates 150 000 Swedes suffered Covid ten weeks. lot population 10 won't. Maybe governments overall liars, we'd inclined believe actually need something.

They've crying wolf forever, shown up, surprised one listen. refer former chief epidemiologist Sweden rather new title vice-chair Strategic Technical Advisory Group Infectious Hazards (recently promoted that).

Is representative speaking private person / expert? uhhhhhhh... u ok bro? Awesome. Thank much Reddit narrative:

Civic duty Canadians better trashy Americans Canadians wear masks Americans wear masks.

Reality:

Canadians Americans mask compliance (80% vs 77% per Sep population younger average? (or least fewer) retirement homes SF?

They sound like they'd prohibitively expensive operate. Perhaps none, expect majority seniors live outside city longer care home (especially $13,000 home bought 1959 worth $2M). Right?!? people think scream mask would safe replacement? Last time checked, 4 cases reinfection worldwide 1 2 showed worse symptoms first infection. hard believe conclusion data points. gonna drop link here,I hope guys come conclusion Good government allow it? try keep forcing untested human vaccine us?? BRB rewatching *Jersey Boys.* tell politicians wait least year start comparing countries' Covid-19 strategies.¬† 

That's odd statement add there.

I get Sweden want critiqued early response contend others ""catch up"". even six months in, infected today fundamentally different infected back March/April. know much more, treatments preparations also progressed. disservice people Sweden let novel virus run country uncontrollably. seems really impossible me.

they CA 16 percent immunity 15k deaths. assume average 30 percent undercount that's 20k deaths. 16.2 percent immune population 39 million yields 6.24 million infected giving IFR 0.31 low. Would correct saying high majority males community jobs go work? AGREE. weeks

‚ÄúPerhaps, epidemic there.‚Äù

Depending define epedemic might ofcourse correct. Nazi Party America Latest YouGov poll shows 80% Canadians wearing masks vs 77% fact CDC even publish underscores doomed country really is... Black, Native Hispanic Americans likely dealing obesity poverty, factors. even account factors, still problem. There's good evidence doctors (at least white ones) give demographics lower quality care likely make negative assumptions. (like wanting give painkillers medicines assumption they'll get addicted) Continue wearing mask washing hands even recovered Covid19, hard. Discounting reinfection risk reckless. I'm talking death rate, I'm talking new daily infections. quotimg things 70s making appeals holocaust. 

Nothing saying even relevant, much less actual fake news story. üíî Also NOTHING causes damage like COVID-19. puts holes fucking heart. Causes brain lung damage.

When first time made mention virus china wuhan matter, even benchwarmer's initial action january?

Seems me, activity topic begun 2-3 months ago.

One would think someone close vulnerable would affect one's way thinking wanting protect **\*AND\*** others.

Here's hoping others share mindset would avoid vulnerable person moreso people close said vulnerable person avoid virus affecting them. Well weekend Berney‚Äôs costume going adapt. Watch CDC. racist traitor America nowhere near amount tracers needed amount new cases have. Yeah...only America that. Everywhere else knee masks worked lol. Okay then, what's idea replacement litmus test, that's improvement done got? Influenza virus family coronaviruses. immune system straightforward effective response. Hmm, cases growing, though. Right looks bit worrying.

But guess Swedish ones too, monday need quarantine traveled Sweden. I‚Äôm sure mean well could quite hurtful tell mother who‚Äôs lost baby nearly full term. skates close saying fault baby died. Swedens goal heard immunity, reported many times Swedish news International news rarely see it.

Here qoute Anders Tegnell, article USA today. 

""We believe herd immunity course help us long run, discussing that, like actively trying achieve made (by press scientists). wanted achieve herd immunity would done nothing let coronavirus run rampant society. trying keep transmission rate low can. taken reasonable measures without even posted?  individual cities patients ICU entire state Wisconsin.

Businesses Faroe Islands received financial help Danish government. We've title long enough. Time pass torch another country. refreshing see someone take constructive criticism account explain opinion clearly response. Thank :) Actually, help. still better surgical masks home made masks Really cool stuff, like normalized population side-by-side data available always absolute numbers. 

It's interesting daily cases graph there's really lot similarity hard-hit areas. pretty much hovered around mid-2000s (or 3000) area inevitably crashing back reasonable level. rose almost exact level, nowhere ever sustained long declining. That's interesting coincidence say least. TIL VA stands think really important decouple science politics. article something scientist said politician. many people using government failures excuse ignore science and/or undermine it. 
The reason replied comment said ""tomato tomato"" implies view scientists way view politicians. still can't believe big country like America many resources can't get virus control. muh freedom. government asking wear masks better protected infringing freedom. Right. like zero education something. overall birth rate rising well? wonder lockdown caused couples decide babies. I'd guess fewer want children Great Depression.  Aka space aids. :(  Dude state in? start something like state legal too. Ahh, OK, new question. be, context, avoided (to render unnecessary)

Did anybody talk preventable causes mistakes steps taken US? read higher usual number (without giving cause) woman writing 'unnecessary' ones  Plenty countries free-at-point-of-care services. make allowances women get quality care. infected migrant workers Bangladesh etc living dorms. younger healthy people. dont think single one died. rest population locals wear masks social distance. also big lockdown early on, healthcare system excellent. probably need desperately. Second wave seems started. +6.4 new cases, highest since mid July. +150 new deaths today (at peak months ago 7 day average 178). Drastic changes flu virus aren‚Äôt primary reason vaccine taken every year. It‚Äôs waning immunity course months. virus doesn‚Äôt significant antigenic drift every year. you‚Äôve immunized twice immunity strain immunized exposed remained strong, would quite well protected years.

The Coronavirus doesn‚Äôt mutate much, due error correction, immunity wanes within months, won‚Äôt matter all.  Jim inJustice lied? SHOCKED! work though? Thank :) none vaccine testing ability cure patients severe cases Certainly see thing me... Re-infection limited immunity. Question common turns be. 11 confirmed re-infections millions recovered people concerning, re-infections common, seen hundreds thousands cases now. may die. Last year donned elaborate Plague Doctor costume Halloween. 
Oh irony... Right entire world global averages, usa part of. think little planet now? Okay added context helps. think may confusing people (me included) using word necessary. people may more-familiar with: ""inevitable"". Even definition two overlap, experience language skews point view.

Purely ""necessary"" anthropomorphised different contexts. harder describe necessary outcomes outside context human decisions. Inevitable almost removes decisions cases. kinder, well.

Telling someone stillborn necessary come seriously abrasive insensitive. Especially arent anyone's measurable fault.

Saying inevitable still crude, least invite people seek blame throughout chain events.

Either way, dont think time place us discussing ... especially child comments sufferer stillborn. It‚Äôs like call repair man look furnace, charge 75 bucks tell it‚Äôs broken need new one. 

Same exact kick balls feeling, except magnitudes expensive. number people get reinfected tiny. likely function malfunctioning immune system. Cold corona virus primarily infects children infections rare adults. suggests long term immunity norm corona virus. low NO2 levels pay big part low low death rate. Mama Mia ! see going disagree. partner works public health research part specifically studies doctors reactions certain demographics patients willingness prescribe certain medications. Let say, doctors biased think that's something also needs work. wife 9 months pregnant. good insurance. far costs prenatal visits/hospital prepay $4012.75. 

Now *shouldn't* pay anything hospital long everything goes according plan. need c-section, going lot more... stealing that! Citation needed? places this. Outdoors heaters cheaper uncontrolled spread. Tampere?

Helsinki sure feels quieter normal. many hard restrictions place number cases growing time people wary. tears though? 

Joke over, hopefully long till get it! Well that's majority humans according public health research. THIS! 
I used analyse sort data (disease disabilities, incidence, prevalence mortality of) pretty decent level questions always come head. numbers expressed seem quite high level without significant breakdown mortality causes. doesnt mean hasnt considered, maybe think muddy waters? would interesting really drill cardiac mortality figures given arguments increase fatal cardiac events caused people seeking treatment. documented evidence COVID-19 causing cardiac related side effects even limited symptoms. Add 'cause' event leading undertaken while/prior cardiac failure would need looked at, would made sense think material number would related strenuous exercise many places less available. would also remove excess deaths related self-harm misadventure. Although thinking it, many places due many less people going getting drunk would expect misadventure down, broadly speaking.

Sorry novel, go back cave :) diverse doctors less skilled? feel sorry countries like Sweden USA unnecessarily disastrous results. could avoided. countries rising can‚Äôt even dream resources fight Covid Sweden America have. greed. society structured way greed. Non American, figure would matter whether Fauci Trump says it‚Äôs well tested perfectly safe. I‚Äôm sorry, didn‚Äôt see this. Thank this, understand coming from. see original comment confusing flu shot $44 insurance job/exchange. find discounts get ~$27ish, poor, that's money need groceries. millions us taking chance getting/spreading flu can't afford shot. 

Just wait til Covid vaccine costs $50 (minimum). wealthy protected, I'm sure design. linear graph waves whereas table cases shows ebbs straight increase numbers. Logarithmic graph also doesn‚Äôt show ebbs may explain difference opinion here. Interesting table representation data looks different graphic representation data. Governor owns one biggest private resorts state. wouldn‚Äôt want close due ‚Äúoutbreak‚Äù Uh bad. thought meant something significant. didn‚Äôt. talking trivial change. sure waste time that. Still one worst world. That‚Äôs matters But: Thailandia Covid free? know meant :) saved Google! I‚Äôm spreading thing.


I watch car crash feel optimistic future though. It‚Äôs doom gloom! 3M reusable respirator (half-face fine: 6000 series 7000 series) along appropriate filters(6035/7093/60926 etc) p100 equivalent/better rating exposed surfaces one-time investment would last long time offer good protection. Consult 3M's website proper donning/removal/decontamination techniques. wanna extra cautious consider protecting eyes too. Time never hear again!

I take work pharma? kind job? Soybeans, think? Linoleic acid (LA) commonly found soybean oil, also meat, vegetable oils, seeds, eggs, nuts.

Your body needs LA can't make it, means LA showing virus somewhere, somehow. stealing you, that's bad you.

Increasing LA intake either reduce covid-19 effects keeping levels normal (similarly iodine pills work uranium radiation mishap?), much, much worse giving virus limited resource inside body (again) body can't make own. Right? know things take time pandemic killing thousands day, mention social economic effects.

You'd think would start ASAP measures population willing listen logical measures, basically. Americans really stupid, they? real, it? public school south, graduated 2008. nurse tuesdays thursdays that's get civil war. ""Airborne"" means linger and/or travel somewhat HVAC systems.

The implication airborne infected people create infection least extent even there.

That quite aerosol transmission comes direct contact infected person. I'm sure depends regional economy. schools kid's school district full-time dedicated nurses.

It‚Äôs nasal swab self administered shipped Quest diagnostics lab. wait never get results back. must live within 1 mile Walmart super center testing area. 

What needed rapid saliva tests developed. ones don‚Äôt require equipment supposedly cost less $5 per test. available everyone would biggest step allowing people go back work effectively prevent spread. Yeah privileged take OP has. blaming system keeps people barely living check check dependent public school child care, can't afford miss day work. poor getting poorer Agreed parents purposely irresponsible, also rule every daycare school around always ""no fever 24hrs"" ^ correct answer 90% Reddit refuses learn Lol what. think video games distorted thinking  No, tracks situations person illness genetically sequenced, times, two different strains (to rule lingering first infection). I've seen people built plague doctor masks M3 respirators inside, thought pretty clever. Using P100 filters too, would legitimately safe walking plague zone (well, except black plague insect borne want waxed woolen trousers coat). Hehe.  Put 3M N95 you‚Äôll see mean! awesome idea. dad something similar Halloween party threw kid. used little plastic pumpkins hid around yard Halloween themed candy toys inside.

The topper one plastic pumpkin slip paper inside said ""pumpkin sacrifice"" it. kid found one got throw Jack-o'-lantern bonfire end night. Technically, yes.

We still meeting metrics safe re-opening. Everyday remain open trading lives economy.

If (in us) would followed guidelines would still 100k deaths, now, due early reopening still refusing follow guidelines remaining open 200k deaths still climbing steadily. also still year away population receiving vaccine. mention absolutely zero evidence vaccine provide protection virus.

By guidelines, locked back 2 months ago, government chosen ignore disregard lives. Idaho confirming well. isn‚Äôt political. It‚Äôs scientist fight. way common people think.


In context, airborne specific meaning.  Droplet transmission, long thought primary means transmission, count ‚Äúairborne‚Äù purposes definition. That‚Äôs reserved spread aerosols, smaller float air much longer.

It‚Äôs doubted virus sometimes spread aerosols. experts sharply disagreeing common is.

On one hand, case studies aerosol spread clearly taken place.  People beyond range droplets infected. Although it‚Äôs always clear cut. I‚Äôve seen experts disagree whether droplets explain Washington choir superspread event. 

But hand, virus would behave differently macro level aerosol transmission common. transmission rate started taking measures much higher commonly airborne. Similarly, cloth masks much effective handling droplets aerosols, effectiveness cloth masks reducing transmission suggests aerosol transmission common. security guards everywhere. new position. Alright thank you! whopping 11 now. need bust toes want count number cases digits.

So reinfection rate .00003476260522087559%. still consider common? said approximately 80% study immediately came mind second one posted. None referenced changes analysis. proves happens. 

We idea common reinfection is, indeed happen. test whether women covid-positive time pregnancy birth. address factor study. yeah, schools probably can't open up. ideal society parents would keep sick children home, reality, many view school free child care give shit many people infect. teacher basically accept fact probably going get sick work. Except Sweden, Scandinavia locked common phrase ‚ÄùThe scandinavian countries locked much earlier.‚Äù Yeah, must sort since I'm seeing all. see juvenile comments mocking Wisconsin diligent, people speculating might spiking, others complaining state's taking seriously. Instead getting weeds this, I‚Äôm simply going listen highly respected independent experts opinion available vaccine. Dr. Michael Osterholm lot experience vaccine efficacy, especially around flu vaccine trust opinion matter. comment two points maybe, one point matter try avoid COVID-19 appears immune matter what. reply says well.

Other point whether assumption correct not, people living life like nothing changed directly impacting people trying best like are. It‚Äôs shame they‚Äôll pay two weeks daycare shut parents need take PTO watch child people could watch child cannot anymore they‚Äôre quarantined. I‚Äôm sure work situation PTO means terms quarantined know businesses paying employees quarantined charging PTO don‚Äôt know predicaments.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* mean came China. mercy Dojo! places starting realize vaccine coming soon. idea ""suppress little longer till vaccine"" fantasy. large scale vaccination coming long time. Ok, see. Thanks explaining it. nobody surprised Man thing McDonald‚Äôs even ever liked bigmac. know restaurant tries replicate like quality ingredients stuff it‚Äôs pretty solid actually *hasidic Yup. people family still isolating home. It‚Äôs 60 days sounds unreasonable, 60 days sounds like guess. 

Given current infection rates able estimate seeing infections placebo group statistically significant. vaccines similar enough previous vaccines good data start see side effects.

You able take two factors make *educated* guess rational consider EUA. 60 days sounds like convenient number picked air convince people they‚Äôre rushing things. wearing Halloween mask better wearing 'No-Mask' since that's fucking thing still somehow. Calm Peirce. Yeah live walkup, hear upstairs neighbors drop paper clip floor, tell #1 #2 timing sound walking bathroom flush sounds, can't even use turbo trainer drive downstairs neighbors insane. Power racks question me. Also, amount unnecessary stress put soon new parents. People aren't. majority support single payer, bigger majority support public option (like Germany Switzerland have). majority republicans oppose national healthcare system.  Shocker, parents can‚Äôt afford miss work sending kids school getting kids parents sick. 

Feeling single moms right big time. wondering reactions there. Thanks info. Ok did. doctor said also ugly. Worst year make list. [Well, course wouldn't. Halloween masks always cover mouth. go buy candy stay home.

Sadly, doubt many people follow recommendations. ""I'm gonna murderer Halloween. I'm gonna wear mask going out!"" - *one ""friends"" social media*. new cases chart keeps scale whole animation. may others... still undecided. ""millions cases"", illness genetically sequenced, multiple times, even two different strains count. 

That much, much smaller number. No, fever, headach chills. though. feever, probably fever headach chills. Ah yes personal attacks help. Reported üëåüèΩ money man. problems world stop covid comes along, bad is. answer usually somewhere middle. me, catastrophizing covid bad undermining saying problem. two sides same, pernicious coin reasons brought up. People really talking things problems covid I'm glad others bringing stuff up. Ok? parents need work, school childcare. 2 weeks vacation 5 sick days jobs, WFH (pre-covid), wonder parents send kids school sick. I'm confused disappointed. removal low quality content, specifically, providing citations, does.

In meantime one current top posts tweet BNO Newsroom, "" NEW: Vietnam reached 3 weeks without community transmission coronavirus"". citations there. Stay safe. guess good thing say following precautions virus burn quickly, longer vector infect you, since re-infection seems occur rarely. Let's break down:

Anti: Opposed to, against; person opposed particular party, activity, idea.

Fascist: advocate follower political philosophy fascism.

Fascism: authoritarian nationalistic right-wing system government social organization.

Therefore, antifascist would ""A person opposed authoritarian nationalistic right-wing system government known fascism."" office 5 weeks. top bottom - hired guy warehouse gets. get 5 weeks ALT, since worked company 20 years... got day one! fml.

To clear, begrudge anyone - wish better here, worse there. son working ass construction company truck tire explode face. 3-days work heal - doctor's orders - get paid days. Anything less 2 weeks screwed. sad me... Basically, virus either:

1. made lab
2. another host humans besides bats

or

3. space. (not stated article, enjoy using imagination) true. ENCOURAGE send sick child school. kid sick hell, fever say need send count unexcused. CPS called child's absences live northeast sickness spreads like wildfire catches literally everything comes contact with. school system terrible. aren‚Äôt risky trials already. People trials sometimes get placebo, comes point giving becomes even unethical challenge trials. 

The point evidence suggests vaccine effective safe, time test effects. I‚Äôd tell go fuck report labor board. ready go back national policies nothing offer working parents relieve work take care kids.

This shithole. middle upper class white heterosexual male great health(150lb 20yo resting HR 45) high risk worked ymca lifeguard time. I'm living college dorms.

Of demographics demographic least effected covid. thing going unspecified autoimmune disorder since gone away.

Even health, vaccine still gave feever, chills headache. Nothing Tylenol fix though.

One main reasons start trial prevent spread covid oldies ymca get it. I'd rather live guilt. also want spread college. Man. can‚Äôt catch break. I‚Äôm praying you! think perhaps religious belief act like mental illness, logic overridden justifications. 

In basic trolley problem, ""allowing five people die acting take one life wrong,"" valid answer disagree with. commandment ""do murder"" rule ""don't stand watch someone suffer something"" something I've heard of.

If case two adults hasten one assured death save another's life, think generally considered wrong even dying adult consents it, trouble figuring sort situation would get murky. Maybe ""not assisting miscarriage"" they're 100% certain baby indeed die.

It funny/odd rules make baby body, parents choose withhold medical treatment child. cure come unknown, possible treatment LA might lessen severe syntopms. might make worse too. Asian countries already this. directing person (covexhausted) saying drop bucket. agree even .5% high number people. 

And arguing, saying seems like guy picks misinformation left right social media sites. half side effects pain injection site 2 fatigue mild fever, nothing worry about. effective immunity. breathing viral particles hitch ride water vapor. breathing. yeah policies regarding time sick leave really need improve. pay social safety nets need like insurance.  hand I've paid it. crazy amount people things. need it... know different them... ""deserve it"". Everyone deserves help part functional society. Sort topic, work? provide sort proof illness? things could make one group, experiences kind poverty lack access care, outperform another metrics like homelessness stillbirth rates? 

I think gut reaction associate cultural factors might affect rates. know complex that. Oh. No. Mobile ads atrocious. Miss ten days school year without doctors note get visited cops. illnesses don‚Äôt necessitate doctor visit. It‚Äôs cold, stomach bug you‚Äôre it. course Covid another matter entirely. supposed go doctor every little thing? Go ER running temp? That‚Äôs Covid is. 

We need let parents know it‚Äôs ok miss school, join class online. Most, including aren‚Äôt really clear rules missing school days year. Can‚Äôt give money people need without giving defense contractors!! Fair fair!!  Sounds like treating morally correct also better economy. current healthcare system benefits people top, everybody else's expense. makes think American vaccine though? vaccine developed Netherlands Belgium. either send sick kid school, stay home, lose job, wind homeless. person daycares. 
Day care wait lists insane. MONTHS. kid waitlisted infant room even born yet. deathrate US lot higher. ""But someone abuses policy"" go-to response anything might actually improve people's lives. Yeah, mean sucks too, better worse. used example directly relate.

People ages affected current political climate, regardless era grew in. guess point virus new. way reporting scale necessary know many reinfections occurring. Lmao hilarious. Imagine thinking snake bite may venomous better wear cloth mask N95. great hear Germanys responsible handling. finacial worry, sick. pay ppl stay home sick, corona keep spreading. feel like anyone looking validate beliefs based Ferguson Model looking wrong place. fair try beginning, actual experience showed model incompetent, time move on. sooo close understand mean friend. wife's ex-husband Socialism ‚â† government stuff. misnomer call safety nets socialism stems propaganda used red scare. wild never instituted mask wearing before. Like cold went work probably infecting everyone one cares ""just cold"" wore mask could work infect people would fine. I'm always going wear mask I'm sick US actually tried levy higher taxes wealthier businesses, would move countries. started impacting North America February. We'd start seeing addituonal premature births due pandemic point. come! whew. Good, ive got family Cheyenne. cant imagine base locked hard would good anyone  use arguing people. Might well try train dog play chess. want cop... Well, thats least surprising post your's Ive seen.  argument claim they're troll

Nice work. pandemic really exposed alot parents really love kids Teacher here. student told week feeling well mom ""think"" covid. 

I understand parents work busy, really messed put child's teacher/care taker risk. think kind missing point first paragraph. mostly saying people going want keep restrictions forever vaccine widely available. though yes may minority, people want fewer restrictions, mean every day going outside see people less gone back normal much can, masks loosely following NPIs. also feel pieces one linked counterproductive getting people follow present NPIs. guess data claim, even lot people stated returning normal soon vaccine arrived, giving masks/distancing. also feel question phrased probably makes survey takers assume situation remains right now. ask ""How states handle coronavirus restrictions vaccine widely circulated"" bet different answers. 

Even politically motivated, point would provide benefit either party. Joe schmoes like us getting access vaccine months gets EUA'd. vaccine slated possible EUA say month two maybe could see it. no, would BEST get EUA'd week election. political gain had? feel whole ""the vaccine contaminated politics"" thing little overblown. Also, can't forget big pharma interests.  Got question ask, required workplace get COVID test, say specific test get, COVID test negative result.

I live another person works seperate company reported told job get COVID test. job demanded share results test order go back work.

I shared results nasal swab negative test job required job requested. Paid person's company pays testing free.

3 days later, job emailed back asking always wear mask home took nasal swab test. Demanded get another different test. Refuses pay new test.

Im little taken back another job demanding take different test someone else dont even work for.

What would do? Amazon prime already started making headway English premier league. India Star Network already moved sports services digital platform

I get watch football, Cricket formula 1 20$ year fee No, (unless I'm missing something) - Rand Paul stated cross-reactive immunity fact, theory, nothing article linked says otherwise. author considers strong theory, - again, unless missed something - there's evidence presented here. two quotes indicative article: ""‚ÄúRight now, think everything possibility; don‚Äôt know."" ""Weiskopf Sette maintain compelling evidence could come""

We're many ideas disease - yes, intriguing theory one need lok into, there's nearly enough evidence base policy it. Sort like dead bodies streets Ecuador? over-filled morgues needed bring refrigerated trucks hold corpses COVID?

I'm convinced anything make ""conservative"" cultists change mind. think scientists already narrowed people got something infected bats looking genetic difference. So...not eating bats directly think.  That's kind you.

If US federally mandated paid sick leave like every developed country, bet workplaces would cover cost flu shot. system point requires people act good faith fail. Congratulations, covid comes you, I'll praying Sure. provide safety net would morally permissible take stronger action behavior. know streets punish endangering public health, acceptable so.

Doing America would punishing people poor Looks like need move Sweden. One major question - good BBQ there? ü§£ difference getting cells respond peptides dish actual protective immunity vivo. Making conclusions 20+% pre-existing immunity observe activation patient samples pure speculation. many ways, even make sense would much pre-existing immunity. Either way, way know significance take prospective study compare infection rates severity. even then, actual public health data shows significant pre-existing immunity, enough stop virus ripping community. Absolutely. said, let's assume violent revolution breaks out.

How combat military? long answer politicians executives, nothing change.

So, ask change answer to.

That requires convincing 1 million people, many who:

- subjected propaganda life.

- Consider occupation core part identity
   - includes upholding State values

- taught enjoy do, obey _told_ do.

So, go to? people run military? That's politicians.

The generals, maybe? 

Well, asking general betray oath they've sworn country public, took seriously first place. 

They always aware possibility they'd disagree decisions imposed POTUS. 

It's always possibility they'd despise whichever president currently office well.

Their willingness place aside personal bias, regardless, allowed reach current position power, maintain current position power.

Most families too. 

Betraying politicians inevitably places family risk, least degree.

I really doubt kind real revolution feasible this. 

The dynamics concrete need someone would willing risk things people, generals included, capable risking. It'd also need possible general convince majority people command defect. Someone‚Äôs obsessed. Lol, no. far though. Lol good thing tried hard prevent cases. Fucking morons. much ""pro life"" guess see way. used get 14 days vacation 7 days sick. pick makes zeros sense. supppose better wording get 21 days personal. That's sick, random day vacation.

Use need it, used get credit vacation. use lose it. sick days rolled over. matter. need day 2 use regardless sick. also give extra day anyone works holiday. Jesus Christ. Encouraging people recklessly spread dangerous disease equivalent people urging precautions. also think people actively encourage drunk driving every often deserve platform make case equally valid alternative driving drunk? Hey, oil black thank much.. one trying get rid it, racist. Yep. got reply back OP really laid thick. Lol household survive one income states, people value stuff kids, agree going get worse. Ah, makes sense. Brain fathom out. get full pay Germany six weeks sick employer.

After time, health insurance starts paying 90% net salary - 78 (yes) weeks. I'm pretty sure even left die streets...

I can't even imagine sick worry bills job (can't fired for/while sick) top that! 

Sick people eat pay rent, too, wtf. think misunderstanding me. I'm saying bad participating system available helping people-- think great can. I'd position extra days.

 think really really screwed point. false scarcity created business basically passed way encourage closeness team. weird sad. lot readers like posts I'm skeptical ChAdOx01/Gamaleya/CanSino live vectored vaccines, I'm practically foaming mouth J&amp;J vaccine. think one promising candidates I'm excited possibility taking next year. hope anti-vaxxers mentioned post eventually agree. audience now.  next year? hope so, threshold COVID existing, audience next year either.  year after. year after. absolutely threat Met's existence adapt and/or willing accept risk changed world.

I think we've entered stage need hope everything disappear exactly like before. organizations refuse adapt change biggest risk extinction. anything, particiption site increased *because* world longer normal, I‚Äôm acutely aware fact every single time choose visit sub. incredibly outspoken measures taken, think far normalizing anything Right doesn‚Äôt answer question: vaccine flu, still kills people. comes flu, vaccine guarantee safety, don‚Äôt social distance every flu season? would say there's situations even wear mask. go stores. get delivery pick free. get pick wear mask. see people fighting make wearing stores parties involved could used pick store. Idiocracy like COVID, there's multiple ebola vaccines, two connected all. Merck's vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV

J&amp;J's Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo

&amp;#x200B;

Different vaccines. gets EUA election day guarantee going make lot people want get it.

After EUA declared study over. stop collecting data controlled study market research.

We lose opportunity study vaccine way Americans reluctant take vaccine obvious reasons. hurt FDAs credibility, resulting long term effects people vaccinating children less, getting flu shot less. October date goes scientists say likely. discredits scientists pushes people toward less trust science.

I republican friend said thought CDC awful keep putting conflicting information, tell truth stop ""wishy-washy.""

The CDC best world politicians making look like trash. Americans believe suggestible Facebook friends. nightmare. 

We need wait election half us going feel terrible take vaccine many not. Yeah going say lot Boomers buy mindset ton younger workers get little sniff ""management"" go full Office Space management style. age thing, power thing. School funding tied attendance. I'm sure that's big part problem sick kids coming school. also kids lice still come school too. phone? Sorry. original comment replied said that. guy canvassing DFW week. reminder married 5 times,

Make sure read guy plan vote. Disorganized people make bad managers, think hierarchy work experience. appreciate :) Looks like wrong again.

Now 11,000 cases Oregon, Washington, New York COMBINED 13,389 Wisconsin reported? tell half people thread actually kids job lmao. ""take sick day"" really viable option unfortunately. like post review, feel free to. really move somewhere like Sweden. Lol

Good luck that. tend want lazy Americans. Oh agree ton stuff ups drugs never approved. Thalidomide relatively safe outside 2 week window, see would approved use original trials included pregnant women bracket. Letting steady stream people get sick die slowly destroys economy.

Flu season never destroyed economy.

Do really think 0 deaths per day realistic goal state population 8 million? wish electric cars cheaper say fuck oil companies greedy corrupt bastards awful contamination. Sweden pursuing herd immunity strategy matter them. agree main point, must point America's repeated continued ""intervention"" Venezuela cause Venezuela's destruction. talking regional measures long time. sound like shift. Billions people, 15 cases United States! I'm scared! 
 
-/u/deadliftsandwings March, probably recently advocating America undergo nationwide lockdown -- would say he's entirely ball. So, makes angry, too, like always has. Parents sending kids school kid gets sick actually keep home. then, get threatening social worker letter kid missing many days. responsible parents/kids get punished. like lost job first kid used measly 4 sick/personal days went feeling like death, start taking unpaid time paid days used up, let go. I‚Äôd 11 years. parents supposed do? absolutely agree sending sick kids school, but, seriously - parents do? dropped 5-year old morning leaving 7th 8th grader showing up. kid practically hacking lung. doubt sent back home. thinking delay death occurring date reported. Sweden also daily reports first months they've scaled back gradually, think conscious decision flaw system. Yea, I've read article month slowing down... premature suppose Parent plus loans forgiven student dies. chose go $721 billion debt. money spend. never spend, spend anyway.

Someone else pay back, interest, someday. young people trouble finding decent-paying jobs, that's who. Thanks. call peaceful protest okay     Quarantine can. would also get tested can. False negatives happen (although relatively rare), ideally want get tested even dad tests negative. Someone pass symptoms without symptoms.  school, nurse (who nurse three buildings district, two across town. Granted across town 5 minutes live lol) give medicine prescribed doctor things like inhaler asthma adhd meds. nurse out, one secretaries hates it.

No tylenol/ibprophen counter meds handed unless guardian comes give them. oldest daughter took nasty fall skating included hitting head skate floor (luckily concussion broken bones). pretty sore bruised days. drive jr high (I work elementary town) lunch break secretary pull class give tylenol. apply every job may want Letting steady stream people get sick die slowly destroys economy. people go shopping, vacations, spending money, like pre-covid levels, mounting pile dead suffering people. Sure risk takers, know safe tend things lot less wise. safer is, better economy. Getting community transmission low enough allow contact tracing much powerful catch even cases. kids go school, people live normally, eat out, spend money. mortality rate. thats cfr. poster put place.  Look dude, works like this. Either catching virus magically grants everyone perfect immunity, want believe, people get reinfected, like Korea told us really long time ago.

So either think ~for reason~ immunity complete permanent even someone asymptomatic never exposed much virus begin with, believe science.

Like, don‚Äôt get people like try twist facts suit conclusion. Nobody trying convince world over. want wear mask stop talking like Q cultist. Public school social safety net. wife use it, kids homeschooled. 

Your social safety nets always seem create need ever social safety nets. wonder is. Seems possible yet optimistic. Fingers crossed. 5 million people. worry 20%, though. Also, makes odds 5 50. Infrastructure services, etc, etc per-capita. US commensurately resources. small country limited resources. US big country large resources. really know can't understand keep coming back it.

Trump thinks thing called hydrosonic missile. think doubt smart me. smart average person street. even close, average man street smart. even high-school evel basic literacy.

Anyway, care. US absolutely problem glad it. Enjoy stockholm syndrome, guess.

Conversation done. makes feel happy think ""won"" discussion, I'm perfectly board that.  That's simply false. travel bans, restaurant bar closures restrictions gatherings rest Scandinavia. comparison.

The pro-Sweden crowd loves spew disinformation. facts researched matter minutes. one surprised this, right? Lol  pass everyone around you, become infected spread contacts. Yeah, kid probably lives, parents maybe long term heart lung damage, maybe coworkers get sick, one person hundred infected going die this, maybe depending circumstances.

We've lost medium-sized city 6 months. Imagine Salt Lake City (200,566), Grand Rapids, MI (201,013), Rochester, NY (205,695), Montgomery, AL (198,525), Amarillo, TX (199,371) gone. whole city completely vacant six months. hustle bustle. that's official body count; estimates closer 250k people died average year. US.

But spread out, noticeable. people died older pre-existing conditions complicated case, easier dismiss deadly potential, ""I bet kid kill anyone like kids get flu. Getting corona mean die."" I'm fairly sure lot people aware amount individual privileges may kept relatively safe date. Whether race, socio-economic, age, health, gender geographic. 

With something like need considering disadvantaged first, make sure they're looked plugged biggest hole first. Well fuckin shit. open schools that's what's going happen.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Duh. always thing. Can't recall number times sent school feeling well, easily remember kids hacking coughing storm. 25 years ago. 

Why articles make sound new, surprising? go public schools lmao switched sides here, misunderstanding, I'm afraid. Condoms = masks, yes. ""Not sex"" mainly equals ""a large dose social distancing"", may also include isolating home much possible, especially one's got kind sickness may Covid.

What appears happen people masks develop mentality like ""I need care social distancing staying home - got mask!"" which, translated sex analogy, leads children condoms foolproof. One needs condoms *and* sex. former, folks forget latter. latter, people become fearful due lack former. (Then, course, unreasonable people care condoms care sex.)

Without doubt, **the** safest way get kids sex. if/when one sex, one use condom. Relying condoms **main** line defense leads lot kids people forget sex, like masks seem way making people forget social distancing, isolation crisis due rampant unplanned pregnancy, wouldn‚Äôt ask people stop sex. won‚Äôt stop. teach them... 

... wearing condoms **AND** fuck like rabbits. See, precisely mean - people develop dangerously wrong mentality either social distancing + isolation masks, social distancing + isolation + masks whenever there's chance infection. wisconsin also huge problem rebel mentality people RABID towards folks follow rules. view ""texas north"" all. creepy people act Eventually California would adopt currency. became powerful, would quickly that, would eventually adopt currency. Ugh!! Yep live polio vaccine single mutation mutates back virulent rate 1 million. cause disease outbreaks. upside live virus also spread children miss vaccine since gastro virus. get low enough supposed switch antigen vaccine stop infections. ‚ÄúbUt.. bUt... sWedEn!‚Äù  really don‚Äôt know wasn‚Äôt expected kids sent school every year flu like it‚Äôs nothing. would amazing work full time cancer treatment. Americans: ""hold beer, look community spread! higher yours! Haha suckers!""......""oh wait. :("" Boy that's punch nuts herd immunity crowd. stayed students months years ago, beautiful area

You almost certainly went summer, otherwise made comment :)  copy Sweden :/ Businesses see money later too. problem benefits vaccination much business itself, society whole. Businesses generally motivated sounds like dream. comparing sweden...a country maybe 12 million people...in landmass size something maine way south carolina, u.s. ? o.O Big surprise there. Jeez, maybe aren‚Äôt conducting daily covid check either. Imagine that? least he's socially distant supervisor. noted little colleges everything college lifestyle.

My university managed significantly restrict classroom crowding (each room seats 1/4 used to), literally everybody wears masks campus, half classes online.

We still infection rate 4x neighboring towns cities. Why? nobody cares get campus. soon get back class, take mask go parties. well-meaning ones least wear mask food comes out, COVID scared food; go away simply there's bowl chips, everybody acts like does.

TL;DR: problem campus reopening, college life restarting. 54, wife 47. Healthy runners. fat ect ect.

I went ER twice year, plus one admission. wife. also two MRIs dress fracture.

Gets expensive fast That's got dumbest thing do. spread grow exponentially ruin kid's social life everyone starts blaming kid. age? definitely see it, would mind linking? checked sidebar before. child ill get 80 % pay stay home 60-120 days/year.

How could society function blatant communism!? would be. disability could get situated good computer stable home life start online work. is, barely scrape whatever jobs husband find. hard worker too, always trying something working things like knitting feels able. would great online secretary, organized hilt. better? weakened virus, mean, colds part corona virus family , mutated cold good than. NNNOOOOOOOOOO SSHHHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT! ridiculous. Loosening environmental restrictions cost anything. addition that, would able afford increase oil gas subsidies. agree level socialism Venezuela worry leads slippery slope,‚Äù ok ok, etc.‚Äù precedent set hard stop rolling pile whatever is. think needs looked local level federal mandate. better 50 laboratories try version? better others adapt best effective plan state. I'm caught pulling face mask talk times. Like mean to, long time someone something voice hole move thing. True, lockdowns effective long enforced maintained. think go back stay-home orders March April expect people comply them, probably college towns close bars indoor restaurants, would eliminate much problem.  That's true, plenty changed.

Costs skyrocketed insurance companies normalized paying single fucking dime pay thousands pocket, still charging thousands every year. also normalized paying anything doctor rotation day one preselected doctors, even though unconscious choice doctor free see you. K data back up? look John Hopkins data every day since pandemic started January. give people false sense security. current recommendations even mildest symptoms leaving house needlessly, risk group, leaving house needlessly. start recommending masks people might feel safer go outside, really safe all. Masks reduce infection rates, they're even remotely effective leaving house first place. What‚Äôs biggest risk factor death? think kinds people look perspective end justifies means -- say absolutely anything, appear take position, repeat falsehood, make things up, service goal (getting preferred politician elected, ""saving economy"", helping country religion, etc.). Many people think like actually know difference believing something not, think deeply, grab fact tidbit lie seems help saying, say also believe it. am. never heard this?!? 

They usually advertise course *everybody* would trying get $1 ounces can't everyone they'd like to.

And probably done dispensaries. personally know couple, one $1 ounces (and Covid cut supply almost completely), others give smaller, still significant discounts.

You could try asking r/OKMarijuana. Lots helpful, compassionate knowledgeable folks might know someone area help patient need. nothing else, get alerted good sales. weeks ago got 20 1g prerolls $1/ea.

Oh, tips medical side: Parkinson's patients usually need huge doses THC get relief. experience (and that, I've got lot), *believe* THCA (the non-psychoactive form D9-THC 'activated' heat) beneficial cannabinoid Parkinson's patients, used concert D9-THC, Caryophyllene CBD.

The treatment regimen use (which directed grower patients, usually possible low-income housing, 'ingredients' important part) patients PD grow:

-a strain tests around 12% THC [they need enough D9-THC trigger entourage effect much THC cause adverse psychological effects PD patients] (bonus tip lower THC strains tend cheap, bottom shelf strains. mistake. That's best *medicine* usually found!). them.take 2-3 hits morning, periodicallybthroughoutcthecday. Around 1g day total, start (unless like baked. that's necessary relief). go around 2g day tolerance builds, hold there.

-as much terpene caryophyllene (black pepper smell) CBD (in order importance) possible. [Caryophyllene shown neuroprotective effects PD patients]

-(the part requires grow) raw uncured leaves, chopped knife put gel cap. majority THCA regimen comes from. Without grow pull fresh leaves from, difficult. 'Cannabis juice' next best source, available. ""Shake"" gel cap would work too. appreciate able productive honest conversation someone internet this. lot people immediately ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like here‚Äôs angry response‚Äù, opposed productive treating people respect opinions. people approach things nuance like you. Would know Israel handling this? started second shutdown, ultra orthodox country Rand Paul fucking idiot is.  knew going happen. actual fuck Absolute per capita? glad I'm never kids. It‚Äôs likely people twice got tested first time thought way unless got super sick, since seems assume complete immunity they‚Äôve it. 

This could type bias you‚Äôre talking about, fact people get sniffles already Covid, it‚Äôs unlikely get tested again.

However, still super concerning happened reasons mentioned. top that, could potentially biases well work either way. people asymptomatic first time, second time gets counted original case (with obvious exception people specifically looked in). Definitely encouraging development. I'm public sector union. Private sector I'm perfectly okay with. goes people go. spreads people don‚Äôt bother keep other. booster hope? testing LA county high while. think it‚Äôs actually less July/August judging lines cars Dodger Stadium testing site. 

There really hasn‚Äôt significant behavior changes recent uptick till now. anything, traffic even worse, indicating people going work.  No! It‚Äôs third wave! /s forgo decorating celebrating holiday yourself! always put sign saying ""no candy, thanks stopping by!"" 

Also, shameless plug r/halloween sub. full nice people overwhelmingly support safe Halloween. I‚Äôm really trying man. people don‚Äôt get it. factory? It‚Äôs fearmongering, it‚Äôs actual lack antenatal care. I‚Äôm pregnant. I‚Äôve fewer doctor visits scans would pre-pandemic, lot women know Reddit bumper group first scans delayed mostly telehealth appointments beginning. part major universities really tell you, people go much smarter average, education much better either

what *do* get major universities connections people lot money small schools.

that's another part university job pipeline needs change. get rid now? Previous popular picks pandemic response folks fewer now, thanks pal. entire school campus quarantined, many towns, several outbreaks. lie like like one ever kid. bags fence, kids handle one see something better one bag take one. Even every single one same. one two kids probably take bags. 

And kid waiting 72 hours eat candy. least 15% consumed trick treating. That's lot walking. need energy. Ok chill lol question 83% people think government order people wear masks, yet 21% people think infringement personal freedoms. I'm interested talk 4% people believe things. didn‚Äôt think needed /s , mistake post replying to, pretty much America struggling covid-19. actually gets frustrating see it. ""Like, bro."" pretty accurately sums response. least 200k deaths 9 months lockdowns - let sink (if capable). Fuck Sean Payton FDA adopted stricter standards precisely response concerns. new standards likely cause vaccine delayed election. fear mongering post? says stillbirths risen covid. accurate. People don‚Äôt need robots healthy.

I gotten HPV vaccine. Cancer many types seen family. opportunity reduce risk cancer opportunity I‚Äôll gladly take. We‚Äôre going dress costumes (that incorporate masks) walk around neighborhood without actually knocking strangers‚Äô doors asking candy. get home we‚Äôll lots candy kids.

They get wear costumes, get candy, nobody gets sick. don‚Äôt see issue that. know Trevor Noah book, this? didnt even need workouts. diet change. I‚Äôm talking generally. Also still effect COVID pandemic. It‚Äôs COVID. It‚Äôs lack adequate prenatal care. Women given fewer appointments scans protect from
COVID, due clinic closures, etc. Well hobby kinda requires meet people indoors. really practical play warhammer outside impossible alone.

Not dear government makes easy limitation opening hours probably closing pubs altogether near future... 1. hardly regulation regarding mask exports China recently
2. masks purchased lowest price, pretty much guaranteed meet international standards they're China
3. pretty much assume sales went shady Chinese agents proper government channels Bay Area, kn95 available lowes, frys, safeways. is. - dumbing everyone comments. reliable government agency (like Germany France), reviews approves it. 

After politicians took FDA, nothing coming current administration would trustworthy. hospitalization yet? think Covid vaccines presumed give lifetime immunity? one thinks that.

We flu vaccine. wears months regardless mutation. Still worth getting.

Vaccine yes no. gradient depending effectiveness, length immunity, percentage population compliance. also depends better vaccines developed future.

It's tempting reduce complex matter black white polarize sub, feed negativity, make everyone generally upset confused. Maybe try help instead.


Edit:
""Play card"" really pisses too. many think kind game debate propaganda. game, human lives horrible suffering. know know anyone suffering Covid kind game play ""checkmate"" internet. actually care human suffering. flu shot takes couple weeks work. It‚Äôs good get early. LOL, good one. sure gauge, pretty much anyone actual Covid-19 tests available students employees take daily.


Just someone doesnt fever, mean infections.


But someone fever, there's reason people exposed them. Fear mongering post. stillbirth caused women allowed get many check ups needed. Covid kill them, doctors delayed care I‚Äôm talking mass vaccination done. start going back normal vulnerable HCWs vaccinated, time enough people vaccinated, back normal. don‚Äôt *start* process going back normal *after* everyone wants vaccine gets it, would take long. I‚Äôm concerned results group (+\- 150) they‚Äôve specified large enough uncover efficacy side effects.

Oh, antibody testing underestimates immunity antibodies disappear earlier T-cells do, also help immunity. They‚Äôd better get target lawsuit named accurately, else they‚Äôll suing ‚ÄúRepublic China‚Äù, aka Taiwan, instead. Labor day parties, 50/50 wearing masks, bars, restaurants, business open normal. Spike continue schools colleges reopened 3-4 weeks ago students teachers schools already testing positive people quarantining waiting test results. know 2 idiot's personally went work normally waiting 2 days get covid results instead staying home. positive im sure spread covid around small city 2600 people. Oh i'm racist call asshole chinese redditor call mother whore second language. Amazing, tell more.

Lets play little game, oh look, f thread Nazis:  WORSE

Tell hatred japanese people, born racist racist choice? Yh FDA approves confident could possibly save effective. cost sham. formula giving kids place stay away nest, along quality education, good thing. Heck, thinking wrote above, thinking alternatives - kids hanging around elderly parents grandparents - probably good thing kids sequestered together, away home. probably prefer staying home. there's doubt kids tricked certain degree. yet another level, parents might asking sequestered college experience cost tuition amount pandemic, kids college sports attend partake in, bar scene hang socialize, college classroom lectures. Again, probably harm felt, since govt still backing college loans make work. fair point. think example, people birth defects thalidomide might differ view considering side effects beyond study horizon.

In trial short are, you‚Äôre likely catch side effects besides immediately apparent. Maybe that‚Äôs ok, honest we‚Äôre disregarding potential prepared event happens. average year? 0. mean irs rural Iowa got nothing going on. Bike rallies car shows. dont walk things. Moved dying parent can't wait skadaddle ass wherever.  many times per year get sick? order 2% \*all tests US\*. Given size school number coming onto campus, hundreds infections would day 1. We're seeing now.

That one university middle corn country 2% tests USA astonishing statistic absolutely humiliating White House, CDC, FDA, pretty much every state health agency country. Yup. really pisses off, see time. People mask gain access, within couple minutes getting in, it‚Äôs promptly chin hanging nose. Covid blame - preexisting conditions. /s USA political stance, pull red team wear mask patriot. pull blu team, automatically inteligence wear mask protect community slow spread virus. Definitely opposition Everyone. I‚Äôm proud school district community done far. one high school, one middle school three grade schools. far first three weeks one case one grade schools. mandatory masks staff students along accommodations like hybrid schedule high school. Kaiser drive-thru flu shots. play card recovered may 'lose' immunity saying never vaccine. FOX News war Halloween wonder people celebrate Halloween days,"" 55-year-old told Fox News.

Chinese person says: guys feel bad, choose buy it.

As old Chinese saying goes, get pay for, want better deal, pay higher price!

During March-June period, want KN95 masks quite standard, want N95 masks can't buy all?

It's choice. exactly. 

Seasonal flu R0 drops 1 off-season fades.

C19 R0 not, yeah always around. 

However, like similar coronaviruses still spreads better cold dry weather, thus increased R0. 

So definite seasonal factor play. R0 increase climate changes. south saw spike people driven indoors heat, cool, dry, air conditioned. Well, he's conspiracy theorist. Obama's birth certificate comes mind. Also, masks pain ass, mine's always popping war, sometimes difficult breathe, make face break can't wear makeup.

I wear one I'm moron, pretend suck. need learn Tyler cycle... figure sit cycle, look leads Ironic saying platform Yes right. America land plenty. Definitely good news. Keep India! Never did, never fair closure planned last year announced January. seem odd closed May, maybe lack business? censoring Masks what? Outside trick treating? Lol Duh'd.  don‚Äôt try shoot virus instead minorities? right, kills 10s thousands people US hospitalizes 50K+ causes 100s thousands miss work every year.

But it‚Äôs bad.

Certainly won‚Äôt bad double death risk COVID year, flu vaccine absolutely bad idea.

The year get sick certainly guaranteed deadly year. Knock wood.

Like, bro. Well defense, that‚Äôs basically told still told. Fear mongering? Nah. it‚Äôs still fight get person care telehealth great, it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs really not.

Ignoring Covid‚Äôs risk absurd well proven deaths it‚Äôs also absurd still don‚Äôt long term plan reality in... 

There‚Äôs reason thing except inability consider what‚Äôs happening react it. I'm toilet home family 3 rooms away I'm iffy mask down. I'm also Canadian. Terrible loss. Like many underlying health conditions getting ill virus serious. [Earlier Article Fighting 10 days, ish, gets severe. Then, waves every four five days bad.

After that, people get better, people keep waves months.

Some people feel completely better 5-6 days. they're outside? would wear masks indoors? oc thing makes sense, politically, beaches alone might offer representative sample.  Remindme! January 1 Christ, that's rough. Sincerely, thanks job - sucks, important. wore masks socially distanced. president steady discounting methods. maybe wouldent shortage stupid fu**ing DT sent China 17.9 TONS PPE April! Masks became politicized trump working politicize months, yah cdc et al fucked beginning trump 40% country follows economy going crash hard. long eviction freeze expect owners go bankrupt? Even lifted renters pay 6 months back current rent job? Without UBI large relief package fucked! pandemic effect job personally yet I'm expecting bad things next 6 months. wrong make right man.

I champion herd immunity, mostly disapprove Sweden handled people use argue herd immunity.

Stockholm sweden. thinking largest city could get herd immunity May thinking country get April

It fucking isn't

there substantive differences gave shit sources, could made accurate claim instead. \^ haha, yeah, say: KN95 masks plenty tight face giant fat head. Pretty sure we‚Äôre still first wave. SMH  That's herd immunity strategy.  tell'em, yeetus-diabeetus. Njit hasn‚Äôt. haven‚Äôt independently verified academic friends said schools also haven‚Äôt layoffs. Except know... people spreading to.

It's like even aware obvious thing care yourself. guess probably well .. families willing smart. neighborhoods like hope scale back... I'm betting though. sad  This. ramped production N-95 masks sent everyone instead checks loans beginning, cases would like South Korea. Governments need serious testing, lockdowns lifestyles adapt local area basis. test, need aggressive, rapid comprehensive trace isolate procedures.

We forced live like adults charge situation, every complains.

My attitude complainers ones preventing normal life, ignoring virus anything. implement reasonable serious system, never go back relative normal.

I really hate complainers, they're wasting time forcing serious people take completely proportion precautions there's choice. There's half-measure, complainers made nothing. Actually flu shot year low effectiveness use Latin America Summer strains inform flu cases Latin America Summer Covid. That‚Äôs another thread. Well, 45 co decided help American factories produce masks even reached out. Hence, US made masks. dont go places. grocery store drive thru. That's it. Yet Fauci refrained stating aerosolized spread virus. Certainly knows. Heck, we've known since Chinese telling us January. think we're still quarreling something serious downright astonishing.

If honest beginning, would used aggressive measures contain spread - contact tracing exhaustive testing. Why? social distancing aerosolized spread possible, everyday cloth mask effective due escape air around mask.

But say mask better nothing? say that, need take account time aspect spread.  need take account shutting economy does. reality is, 65-70 million Americans age 65, vulnerable. continue along been, flattening curve overburden healthcare system, take 15 years run elderly Americans protect (once they're infected, would likely ease social distancing rules).

A $21 Trillion economy Trump want spend money PPE exhaustive testing. He'd rather crash economy, bail 1%, let coronavirus ""wash us"". needed governors organize grocery shopping deliveries, food need help it. Full pharmacy deliveries, telemedicine. Hospitals covid non covid.
Massive production N95 masks needed implemented, still does. 
K-5 grades back school. others online. Feds needed provide online curriculum nation. Younger kids needed attend school using junior high high school buildings elementary buildings small class sizes social distancing. Ventilation building needed checked. Lots teachers volunteers take extra classes due small class sizes/restructuring. Community small daycare settings-4-5 kids. Feds pay expenses daycares. need lots spaces, providers, food, etc.
We‚Äôre lazy unorganized this. would take hard work community compliance organized government entities. seems little America anymore.
Wear mask. sources. company factory China shut three weeks ago ten people got coronavirus. Factory shut two weeks military guard.  understood reference. new town? That's great President still saying 9 months. Tf think calling mother whore chinese asshole.

Point 1 Ok, FAR biggest city sweden June. mean, pretty spot imo. funny thought city could hit herd immunity. Kind foolish idea borders surrounding areas. again, basing modeling incorrectly high numbers . way, look controlled cases like prisons zipcodes. Herd immunity always 70-85%. Period.

The 20% HIT comes fact people still social distancing. non-social distancers hit 85% HIT local environments, combined social distancers means see lot infection waves peak around 15-20%.

But second stop distancing....

And really seem like protective immunity lasts couple months. least partially reset herd immunity levels. may true vaccines well. concede gaslighting, wrong terminology. even many anti-maskers left. 

It's problem solves itself, wanted get morbid. Well alot mask wearing countries well. obviously truth rather complicated. It‚Äôs incredibly dishonest say ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù. virus conceived 10 months ago, way know yet anything permanent. tried to, without understanding post viral fatigue entailed, I‚Äôm going completely dismiss opinion. effect lockdown unique UK. one example. added another interested.

[source guideline matters whether schools open. laughable pretend give shit keeping case counts open schools there's vaccine. They're full propaganda mode blaming everything schools surge cases. ! quite understand many Asian countries, NZ/AU, stomped pandemic lockdown Europe countries haven't. I'm afriad people would deny lockdown measures ""appeared ineffective somewhere world"".  covid symptoms fast acting like flu gradual like cold? Purely speculation think lot big spike Madison due UW starting back up. also huge portion state actively fighting even simple safety measures politics. It‚Äôs gross. Actually constitution, part Charter Rights Freedoms.  referring person replying to, sorry clear. yeah, definitely OK peak. I'm sure people really forget things happening selective memories narrative head want disrupt. us suppliers/manfufacturers cut say chinese unprofitable.

I read family Texas company ramped swineflue sars. soon virus hospitals switched back china cheaper available. price something like dollar less box around there. box supose..10  
 20. 

He lay good percentage workforce.

This time hospitals want sign think 3 5 year contract keep buying. can‚Äôt make money selling $1 masks $8 tell us Number 1 optimists deleted comments.  great idea I‚Äôm totally stealing it. (Provided county‚Äôs rates don‚Äôt go right course) Here's wave thing.

In 1918, spike. bad bad. ended people fooled summer weather's effect respiratory virus thinking bad. chose move on, grew complacent.

Then winter came. far worse ever thought

That's ""second wave"". winter-making-it-worse society adapted believing bad.

COVID bad, first wave never quite ends, without interventions big changes behavior.

But winter's still coming. pretty terrifying. pregnant start pandemic, gave birth May, didn‚Äôt know outcomes time. Pregnant people told ‚Äúassume worst hope best.‚Äù Vaccines 100% effective people know vaccinated. saw unmasked person store getting close would feel comfortable knowing fucks wear masks also likely get vaccinated. I'm vaccinated know 100% effective want get antivaxxer store, bring home diabetic mother otherwise illness 60s. 

See, problem. Even someone said vaccinated there's reason believe them, believe waited appropriate amount time antibodies give immunity. need wear masks infection rate low problem. vaccination starts still Covid outbreaks dumb dickers get vax wear mask social distance. Alright, thanks. Seems logical. wasn‚Äôt sure do. honestly sure rest world, N95 US standard, suspect demand world-wide.

All I've head reasons behind ongoing long-term N95 shortage nobody trying fix.. excuses. Pretty sure design drive prices profit had. US tends make decisions based profit unfortunate situations. 

Perhaps day rest world figure profit USA's eventual downfall. parents upset kids this! You‚Äôre reason many people negative view stem.

No, people negative view good it. many people get proper education math/science. enjoys things can't understand? Nobody. calling important softer fields study retarded.

Because answers either right wrong. 

That subject wanted turned even without pandemic. motto fuck poor poor fuck people even less fortunate me. people were, even question. We'd much free. Anti maskers fucking small business economy thing person. Mom seen Whiskers? Would fair say Sweden received international attention countries similar really size? Would better refuse interviews? 

Your link article referring interview FT sent (ever considered might seeing articles media Sweden Covid-19 actual interviews?)

Where slagging anyone? answers questions openly admits Sweden sure issues beginning. quite sure feel strongly him.  made day aren‚Äôt first wave yet case small details. guy thought largest city sweden going hit herd immunity mid summer totally wrong. point. %, weeks kind minor details. back find later antibody test showed 6-8% looked like fool. lot people hoping right herd immunity easy target hit basically nothing. wasn't, many died sweden due recklessness. Look Sweden death rates vs nordic countries. wants masks? actually frightening. Sounds like worried second wave. Lol talking about? I'm def ""outraged."" genuinely wondering joking statement. even tell someone even ""outraged"" ""losing shit"" computer screen?

I guess joking sarcastic, though? still think ""humans eradicated number diseases"" literally pointed we've ever eradicated **one**, Smallpox.

The definition ""eradicate"" means completely destroy put end to. Although we've made incredible strides Polio, eradicated. Humans ""eradicated number diseases"" - I'm merely pointing statement factually wrong. disease record we've eradicated, again, Smallpox.  Sigh...I wish Canadian. opened everything, surge infections, like everywhere else world saw same. However individuals following guidelines problem? 


This ""top doctor"" also told people months wear masks denies aerosol real. credibility really lacking. One dads friends suffering he‚Äôs told scared sometimes immediate relief better feels. costs lot money doesn‚Äôt believe test 10 masks per vendor, article tested 200 masks total 15 vendors, that's 13.3 masks per vendor. NPPTL list comparable article. Uh.... what?  Whats nonwoven mask? Saran wrap? Disney people everywhere swarm second mask goes nose. still personally agree going theme park right now, anyone, seem best. max 10 people lowered version, implemented area 145 cases recorded 0 new. march-may wuhan-level No. It‚Äôs ok. Lots totally preventable.  can‚Äôt imagine mess they‚Äôre mishandling public health. always thought uninsured paid indirectly insured. Hospitals charge insured (and companies) higher prices procedures. everyone get insured? costs carried insured prices procedures go down.

Correct wrong. would someone recovered covid19 required wear mask? Clearly would longer risk others. mortality Winter.

The realization new normal long slog cut it, need more/fundamentally change approach. Thank request, comrade.

u/Nadasbody said N-word.  Nobody's science comes news paper headlines.  science works.  first time racist latina, guess mods care. Racism ok reddit guess latinos.  Doctors offices really safe. might give shot car. US we've never much enforcement. edited add DC USA ignorance interfere Canadian brilliance explain karma matter? never understood.

Also, virus bad. need really deal stop tone policing. 

It almost, also, certain evolve nature since would highly improbable given characteristics. literally said ""essential activities"". mean exactly? sounds eerily similar lockdown me.

You said ""distancing"". mean schools close cant really make kids distance school? mean ban parties gatherings? Nope, earloops fine, allowed hospital use due regulations, regular consumers job. Me, too. 

Even LDS church couldn‚Äôt get people wear masks. 

It‚Äôs honestly really telling‚Äîwe know truly serve now. locked completely eradicated virus. Unlike Sweden rest west. comes back lockdown again. new infections surpressed. Deaths started rise cases risen. Genuinely curious think lockdown killed people? Nope, government really dysfunctional. clear Democrats wouldn‚Äôt give away farm get second relief package passed, shifted blame-game mode election. election, Trump Senate GOP lose, still won‚Äôt relief we‚Äôre dealing nihilists think it‚Äôs perfectly acceptable let political opponents suffocate death become impoverished large numbers. election, game becomes ensuring things bad possible blame Biden Democrats things bad.

We see stimulus January 2021 things land right away. don‚Äôt know millions people going keep roof head feed meantime. single football player died Covid. one guy Pennsylvania died playing football who's death never confirmed Covid. restrictions maybe going place. ... gonna argue ND get first dibs, remembered everyone thinks we're part Canada anyways.

If case, Oxford/AstraZeneca trial still paused Pfizer released data stated events Moderna using dosages caused SAEs Phase 1?  Uhhh New York State highest death toll country. De Blaiso dragged heels weeks shutting NYC. They‚Äôve since corrected that, NY isn‚Äôt success story. America hasn‚Äôt war decades still thinks it‚Äôs big dick swing around.

They‚Äôre country version fat middle aged guy used highschool athlete. Fugaku, perform 415 quadrillion computations second, recently found face masks made non-woven fabric effective blocking spread Covid-19 via airborne droplets made cotton polyester think one biggest complaints anti-mask folks fact they‚Äôre afraid masks would become ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù forever.

Extending mask use vaccination would play fears feel would embolden even more. You‚Äôd see lot average Joe‚Äôs pushing mask mandates case. couldn‚Äôt. fuckwits couldn‚Äôt even win war bunch barely armed folks desert.

Get fucked bud. Americans can‚Äôt win wars pussies grit. Thats thing though, be. assume effectiveness 50%, it‚Äôs reduction severity across get vaccination

Not experts making assumption. Sweden averaging 1 death per day. 1. can‚Äôt stop flights. need planes flying cargo important people. You‚Äôre living fucking fantasy land. doesn‚Äôt matter whether officially lo shutdown behavior consumers effect. 90% reduction air travel. think people still flying? kinda feel like trump absentee parent talks drunken stooper encourage‚Äôs ever want consequences.

People saying similar things 2012 too. much happened. did, I'd skeptical chances, too.

I'd love find way convince military act behalf though. USA! USA! USA!  true experience; don‚Äôt generalize. lot trying protect jobs workers safe open. one got fired university many shut year. got docked days pay survive spring discuss it, looking all-causes death totals. right traffic deaths even death caused Covid directly indirectly. 

For example death caused Dementia / Alzheimer's 10K normal year nursing homes can't fully staff lacking resources provide needed care patients. Everything tested seems legit, probabilty high. Yeah, experience know works. Perhaps someone forgot tell computer face shields reduce number particles person exposed to, low levels particles means person may even realize he/she expose develops immunity anyway. Supercomputers good data given. can't invent data. Garbage in, garbage out. That‚Äôs selective pressure works. Selective pressure results multiple mutations virus environment, particular human behavior environmental factor causes specific mutation spread faster others. one highest death rates world. get excited that. care, wear damn mask. Social distancing focus. useless masks. masks talisman. virtue signal. symbol subservience and/or empathy. protecting anyone disease.

Here I'll like you, news today: Festivals full unmasked gatherings thousands people happening Wuhan China month now! thought global pandemic started think length earloops consistent. part ""all government bad"" crowd? **guy** wearing lace thong **their** face
 

you already told us he's guy, think safe use gender specific pronouns point inconvenient cause we're used masks unconformable cause industry figured make nice one's yet. Wearing mask different remembering bring car keys not.  Congrats Nice attempt move goalposts thats need push cells inmunity like AZ vaccine, like moderna one 250K / 280K figure includes 200K deaths directly attributed COVID. Ok?? Even better, say KeepAmericaGreat.com Lol.

I know case counts accurate, good testing system positive tests month (which Victoria's requirement fully lift restrictions), pretty sure gone.

Rejecting imperfect metrics entirely they're imperfect pretty silly. skiing winter...  morgue overwhelmed hospitals figured make space, lacked staff states bring medical personnel. states also began shut restaurants bars instituted mask ordinances They‚Äôre saved all. Universities using COVID means absolutely gut staff non tenure track faculty positions. keep going back 'all restrictions?' restrictions talked about?

Hello! stepdad type 2 diabetes worried get coronavirus since many deaths reported diabetes. I've trying defend much could scared one day might catch unconciously infect him. wondering possible study statistic realized case mortality rate type 2 diabetes people COVID-19? really want know people got COVID-19 type 2 diabetes many lived died. Thank much! Honestly perspective CDC, aerosolization really change public needs mitigate spread virus. best going force minor fixes circulation ventilation systems. testing good thing shows many cases are.

Thats meant, want tests available many baiting words satire. He's talking Canadian Tire money. that's we're talking specifically here. 

No, making accusation decline hospitalizations exaggerated. Again, easier manipulate stats hide bodies hospitals. 

 healthcare workers otherwise occupied

Most health care workers see they're returning regular hours actually days now, July working 16 hour shifts end site. also check county covid hospitalizations state health dashboard compare hospitals. many avenues redundant reporting suberterfuge viable. 

This really weird issue dig heals on. honestly insulting huge disservice tens thousands frontline health workers state suggest incompetent unwilling see vast republican conspiracy right front faces. Yeah, you‚Äôre number one. also applies less 40% want religious extremists SCOTUS. America, say means taking rights away ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Yeah exac...wait one minute.

They aren‚Äôt stingy compared back March get one per week put paper bag reuse straps N95s breaks.
Our hospital system one point reusing recycled mask also. comparing atlantic readers supporters probably unintentionally greatest insult publication ever received. blanket statement. basic logic.

If test people something, chances find people it.

Also article bullshit. obvious tests show many cases are, that's happens test people something.

I'll say third time case get it. Testing good thing, shows actual amount cases are. Testing increase number cases, reveals many is

If someone covid tested, doesnt mean it. straight CDC. Lots things cause long term damage dont stop things.

You free continue mask distance pandemic pretty much based numbers think say politicized headline feel like live either Utah, Idaho, Florida, Arizona. legal weed great snowmobiling too

I'm moving  2018-2019 flu season estimated kill 30k people.

Sure thats significantly less covid, thats still 30k people. thats 10 9/11s, 70-80 fully loaded 747s crashing. thats deaths youd get nuked town Eureka, CA.

Are going look eye someone lost mother, father, son daughter flu tell party outing friends worth loved ones life? whole first paragraph, umm.... lot nurses complaining they're still using two masks given back *March*. Near me, supply enough healthcare workers know stock five re-use they're replaced every twenty wears.

I yet hear anyone America yet afford toss N95 single use. certainly using disposable since pandemic began. Thus makes sense reason they'd protect medical staff people. playing devils advocate: think jobs professors, staffers, transportation, cooks, sanitation ect. saved paid colleges opened. wonder opening colleges mitigating economic stress would befallen people would affected economy longitudinally. 

There's easy answer. would preferred colleges remain closed virtual I'm actually pretty impressed much local university handling open-campus situation. double blind placebo controlled study? Kind explains itself. morbidly obese conditions relatively young (mid 30s) mostly infections people 40 years old. We‚Äôre probably going shut bars restaurants again. Like private parties reduced, drinks, people get careless stupid.
The infection rates seniors quite low won‚Äôt stay way enough stupid people walking around virus. deaths seniors Long term care facilities. found sewage Italy Brazil December November? still remember early days late December, back /r/China_Flu scientific sub compared /r/Coronavirus; everyone losing minds lockdowns, saying coverup riots insurrections. remember someone posted videos burning streets buildings, saying footage scene, lockdown keeping revolution spreading.

With western media, China's damned do, damned don't. Likely so. I've heard arguments break constantly exposed different viruses might cause bit trouble over. lost Hydrochloroquine. actual alert ECRI cited article testing imported FFRs revealed 60-70% provide sub-95% filtration performance

I know lot imports China feel like nowhere study imply title suggests. miss something? bad Americans hard time understanding civic duty. Great job Canada. canadian, don't. predictable response too. like copy-pasted internet loser. 

 enjoy it; really enjoy explaining things. Hopefully someone, obviously you, find useful.

 hope continue enjoy really dumb predictable. problem right seems hospitals busy, leading people false sense security. know plenty people using hospital rates excuse ignore case rises. give GPS tracker leg test can't remove know cigarettes already banned minors, carry 12.5% tax (on top GST), must display grotesque graphic images health effects smoking right? Cars rules use type out. government duty mitigate risk order protect health safety citizens, covid.

Eliminating covid feasible plan vaccine comes out, look New Zealand eliminated significantly longer incubation time yet resurfaced anyway. Thus rational plan minimize number cases healthcare system overburdened, well stall time till vaccine ready. anything waiting heard immunity approach that's already failed, thus mitigating risk minimizing transmission best sane solution

It matter 1/3rd died solely covid, factor lead death preventable death. death hands public health officials, who's sole duty protect health citizens. can't believe often point needs saying: someone sick going die eventually mean *acceptable* died *now* covid, deserved chance live longest life possible covid cutting short still tragedy.

""*Only 99.98% people die!*"" 7.8billion people worldwide that's 56,000,000 people. acceptable you? many people die personally want fulfil yout basic human obligation protect community?

And nobody stalling flights imports forever, Australia New Zealand actually considering opening international travel next year. counties low manageable levels better testing/quarantine systems installed international travel resume. vaccine developed thus virus' spread heavily limited restrictions lifted. Canada small country. No, currency used globally. bit exclusive weird I'm sure getting there.  Cut open see 4 layers. Passed lighter water test. I‚Äôm pro mask person around I‚Äôm starting feel like early 2021, certainly spring people gonna say fuck it. There‚Äôs way hell people going continue beyond Summer probably gives lot places northern hemisphere bit complacency. Don‚Äôt forget athletes, coaches, teachers, etc. Joey you? really look numbers results calculated making blanket statements like really think 10pm curfews going great impact transmission. mask use help though, depending compliance. you... someone lives UK. inconsistency thing consistent. probably finds mask wearing psychologically disturbing. really bothers too. virus, seemed world starting realize mental health important physical health. guess ‚òπÔ∏è. thing repeated ""literally"" calling word stupid? Wow. Intelligent. sounds like fire hazard still cannot understand oppression claim try make single antimasker I've asked anything say repeating oppression people. I've given logic them. wouldn't, jury, condemn person beating one rabid morons silly.  LOL, every post person posted? COVID far deadlier infectious flu know long-term consequences COVID infections, unlike flu. Wait, what? sarcastic? infectious disease humans able 100% eradicate Smallpox. literally one record we've ever able squash.

450,000 people worldwide still ***die*** Malaria. Polio still exists 4 countries. Something like 600 people past decade died bubonic plague aka *""black death.*"" Covid-19 likely never eliminated, community controlled vaccination therapeutics, there's reason resume normal life again. Nah, implying people blind idiots would follow someone matter wrote. gave ultimate group morons follow someone matter many people gets killed. welcome. LITERALLY (incase missed word), PUBLIC SAFETY Issue . everyone's business. retarded fuck. Oh man thought read ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs‚Äù thinking 9 deaths that‚Äôs incredible... it‚Äôs rural tiny Indiana... went school cool place Yes, one comment ""deduce"" like social gatherings talking. maybe, maybe, find mask hinder that. also problem talking wearing scarf winter. would say nice try no... wasn't. lol. understand snarky, obviously mean text 1000 people Tuesday 10% test positive, test 10000 people Wednesday 1% test positive official cases, sharp decline positivity rate likely means undetected cases along. mean, berating pointing fingers pretty much Denmark's since day 1 pandemic. Whenever there's problem, evident see, Dane quickly says ""but look Sweden"". gotta agree, seems Danish coping strategy.

I've yet hear Dane admit tragedy daily new cases start pandemic. ever hear ""but Sweden"". Get grip - actual risk it? Everyone wearing masks, everyone outside? laughs Bolsonaro one shot point blank back head returned gun? USA great place hit number week ago least. yeah mental health going shit bed especially move indoors November election destroys everyone‚Äôs hope dreams making America great again... careful, piss casedemic herd immunity trolls talk testing tracing working control virus. Medical staff key workers hopefully first. Oh politicians rich pals. Korean oriental markets. Clean pretty decent fresh products Asian snacks. Last time went local H mart, 10 pack KN95 $20. wish smart people U.S.

We might mess. IFR me. dont shut flu, shut current IFR CDC

70+ years: absolutely everything protect nursing homes 40% deaths.  However benefit general lockdowns us mask distance outside nursing home  No, take one. holidays plan seeing anyone.

I'm convinced something COVID like. I'm 28 symptoms really normal put ass weeks.

I also lot travel work/shake lot hands think picked someone also travels lot. Apparently so. also then. ridiculously judgemental statement might expect a... cretin, make. boo hoo think June jokingly asked vet could inject it. said sure. 

I try it.... wear mask reason pull ambulance firetruck behind me. completely false scare mongering mate, dont 'dat heb op feesboek gestaan' guy. government absolutely denying disease airborne, said airborne start, hence 1.5m rule. reason government want us keep 1.5 meter everyone follows rule, effective masks, according experts. Masks effective, still relatively high chance infecting others, especially cases people touch masks, get rid itch, touch others, ideal world happen, does. Keeping 1.5m 100% effective either, remember reading percentages start covid 90% + effective preventing getting covid, nearly 100% outside environments. thing is, suspect, government thinks/wants everyone keep distance rule, super invasive, refer later, quite effective, seen surpressed first wave. think, imo kind right this, people completely ignore distance rules wearing face mask, false sense security. Reality right people tired covid distance rule, therefore barely follow people know well, hence high percentage 'at home' infections, think wearing masks better current situation, think would matter much, since infections home, one going wear mask home.

The possible next way would wearing face masks allowing people close proximity public, regardless rules say keep distance, according experts would worse keeping disease check 1.5m, seems logical me, pure 'air', aerosol particles, even wearing mask, touch hands, spread touching someone something. expert, suspect government aware fact restrictions much, people follow all, meant 'it super invasive', bit distance, make many rules people ignore all, strike balance restricting spread, keeping normal life going function all, seems dumb stupid, people simply build long periods socializing bunch distancing, many rules people think bullshit stop following them, worse few, lock months, people simply stop following it, even rules say otherwise, saw last months real lockdown, social gatherings taking place lockdown time went on, currently point people caring wanting get on, necessarily blame government, part human nature too. mean, disagree current way handling it, think masks mandatory shops public buildings possibly restaurants etc, kind understand government comming comes rules, said, agree it. saying government believe airborne complete bullshit, watch first speeches Rutte, says multiple times, made bad decisions, especially comes way testing, spreading misinformation bad everyone makes look stupid. None criteria lists point, reason believe anything normal pneumonia. winter. gonna think related flu season something. look it. probably entered system left that. went next patient.

Thats point last criteria. patient ARDS whose negative flu, responding antibiotics, infects hospital staff raised alarm immediately. 

Pneumonia pathogen, complication infection. infection presents symptoms similar SARS known pathogens detectable, alerted WHO, plain simple. closing Wuhan health commission jurisdiction lab Shanghai? 

The Wuhan health commission jurisdiction Shanghai. mentioned memo confused told what. Wuhan health commission ordered labs samples destroy censor information releases. Labs like one Shanghai recieved guidance (from different authority) requested samples transferred designated labs. 


But noted clear guidance available public whether bsl-3 lab (inappropriately) designated lab emerging infectious diseases. appears case though, Wuhan Institute Virology bsl-4 lab China. would assume enforced directive, took data, destroyed lab samples. gave professor stern talking protocols publishing without permission.

It's nice assume things never know long CCP would've taken alert public impending outbreak. forget researcher's rationale going policy releasing information. team made finding public January 11 saw authorities taken obvious action warn public coronavirus.

Six days verified genome sequence reported it, felt speak out. Imagine much better China could've done containment wasted week two labs (WIV Shanghai) verified genome instead told citizens take SARS like precautions. Probably would've helped many countries around world prepare see problem that? COYA thing hospital. happens states too. 

Not sure mean, USA HIPPA protect patient's right privacy. absolutely limit discussion anonymized patient conditions. CYA censoring happen hospitals USA, definitely hospital scared government labeling conjecture misinformation using misinformation laws punish healthcare Sustained H2H transmission would interested know original Chinese CDC team came sustained H2H transmission. surprised 'waiting evidence' part due Wuhan officials trying make look less bad. making labs run every test step needed meet every checkbox sustained transmission. probably hoping problem goes away, thinking part severe flu season.

I would suprised. made look bad world time. What's likely system government that's devoted sweeping mistakes rug every possible level. clearly unified effort, lots breadcrumbs left over. Beijing finally got involved, looked situation said ""maybe quetly fix this"", ""maybe become widespread"", ""maybe reality situation real"" atleast better part week gamblers fallacy wore off, pulled start right thing. China fucked many levels, yes, eventually come senses. double edged sword. tally infections unblind trial statistical power prove efficacy. Unblinding trial enough power reduce P-value required successful subsequent unblinding making success difficult. vaccine work infections early effective one treatment control groups collecting infections. likely get results failed candidates first.

Be mentally prepared this. number vaccines tested right failures. probably find successful ones selection bias. expected two three failed vaccines mean impossible make vaccine. shouldn‚Äôt police called? 

it job enforce masks right?

I wear good protection socially distance doesn‚Äôt prevent teenage germ factory infecting others as-well myself. Get air purifier hepa filter, ac winter stupid course!! ice cream make moldy frappe instead try get sign waivers refusing treatment prior getting covid, signed statement agreeing hold harmless facility case resident gets covid. Except that‚Äôs estimate got close. specifically remember prediction believe made late July 3 weeks we‚Äôd go 140k 170k deaths (I think) August 15th. undershot prediction bit definitely recognized trend. believe also made similar 3 week prediction mobile unable verify moment. 

I get earliest predictions probably off, I‚Äôve following predictions since June July they‚Äôve pretty accurate part thus far. hope wrong kind doubt point. state NH borders Canada want move Quebec please speak French üôè comment unrelated discussing reason drastic u-turn governments masks? told wear 3 months line they're mandatory. Surely common sense masks stop particles spreading air. really take 3/4 months study figure? learn regards mask-wearing previous pandemics? many questions, many answers.

That along lack education valuing knowledge us leads lot dumb people. see smarter good portion people really? mean feel extent.

Regardless I've attacked like actually close hit parents side regarding trumps policies, handled coronavirus believing word politicians say.

The media, lack education, political divide ripping families, friends loved ones apart here. Yes electrically shortened pregnancy probably c-sections also induced birth. battle qith insomnia morning, digging phrase means.

It's elective C-section, apparently culture makes okay schedule inducements major holidays, etc. couple mind guess could see people want kid Christmas New year's Easter etc show kid. And/or go back drinking. knows.

Where live unnecessary C-section rate insanely high, hyper-educated wealthy area. would interesting see C-section rate versus areas high prompt infant mortality. Propaganda, shit UK currently going weird hybrid pride NHS whilst also wanting completely destroy foundation NHS works. Why? average person dumb, exactly half population dumber guy. Idk would trust company deliberately *withheld information regarding carcinogenic properties baby powder* handle Covid Vaccine went check maybe old death one ""uncertain date"" deaths get reported assigned later correct day, seem like - number currently 5 changed. So, basically American. mom told ""I theories."" smug grin topic kids going back school came up. doubt she'd change mind unless something directly effected her. one volunteer? start hunting around online. Lack healthcare obvious one. also country still foundation-ally racist. I‚Äôd receives worse medical care country black women. consistent year year got shot yesterday. Bill Gates tracking every move. /s Oh saying measures needed? change heart? kind horrifying stupid people around area. Yes Great many days Denmark‚Äôs total cases exceed Sweden‚Äôs? 1000? 2000? really is. November Someone bring family unit don‚Äôt they? think got it? tooth fairy? company required masks anyone building well state did. We're manufacturing company operating whole time, we've lot people still coming even office workers home. August, company lower rate cases among employees overall rate surrounding county. 

And county finally institute mask mandate, case numbers started steady decline shortly continued last 2 months. Could coincidence, certainly evidence experience masks make things worse. whole service industry low customers. airlines 80% grounded. I'm surprised 10% enough marshmallows unfortunately. Nobody affected../s #takeCDCback Today, Sweden's averaging 295 new cases per day. Denmark's averaging 462 rising rapidly. Factually, Denmark worse Sweden now. 

Honestly, Denmark's managed get second wave larger first feat bad management puts par America. Ok. Let ask question, I‚Äôm trolling. UN/WHO/Gates end polio vaccine that‚Äôs causing outbreaks Africa South Asia? get we‚Äôre taking live virus vaccines Covid, I‚Äôd like know likely went wrong.

The countless times I‚Äôve called ‚Äúconspiracy theorist‚Äù trusting current systems absurd Frank Sinatra Great news. Listening medical scientific guidelines works.



Having ridiculous 'nothing works' attitude terrified change, temporary measures needed fight deadly pandemic work. costs lives economy. directly contribute opiod crisis. Dude, showed thread OP correct Tegnell believed herd immunity beginning April. I'm sorry cannot handle incorrect. Hope get better. 11mil people, 10k dead, 30 km2 land.

I know Belgium giving up. really *good* insurance? live USA cost per child exactly $100 (basically 2 nights room board copay) visit #1 leaving hospital baby. baby number one NICU time. Granted, avoid copay permitted choose hospital liked best.

I've never thought insurance particularly amazing. we'll see long term debt significant impact Finland's long term growth. forecasts economies similar EU Commission economic forecast released Tuesday. predicts Finnish economy shrink 6.3 percent year grow 2.8 percent next joins Finland tail end forecast, growth next year estimated 3.1 per cent. year, Swedish economy expected shrink 5.3 percent. clearly understand ""the same"" means Well, virus hoax one get sick. /s Except Fauci said 70% ‚Äúbest case scenario‚Äù I.E. unlikely Yea, I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs works here. drive testing takes 20-180min depending site.

I know it‚Äôs crazy, everyone lives do. everything live *gasp* I‚Äôm sorry loss. idea make women give birth. thought risk associated surgery. gobsmacked. care mandate think crime wear mask crime beat someone.

So think progress anymore discussion. nice day. Weird ""pro-life"" people deny women free maternity post-natal care babies die. 

What's that? 

Where live (New Zealand), maternity care free 26 weeks paid parental leave norm. that‚Äôs stupid. Medical examiners routinely put multiple reasons cause death. definitely count deaths Covid deaths, usually contributing factors don‚Äôt ignore. would see side effects 2 months? baby May. Definitely less screenings person visits. told use stupid useless Doppler app iPhone listen baby‚Äôs heartbeat. didn‚Äôt work shit also, I‚Äôm OB, hell supposed listening for. missed fact baby IUGR missed congenital heart defect. third trimester appointments rushed. didn‚Äôt even get 6 week postpartum checkup, got phone call instead. standard care abysmal, I‚Äôm surprised findings. Sure, it‚Äôs one. There‚Äôs 4-5 per decade since 1970s we‚Äôre pulled FDA approval - Zantac, Celebrex, fen-phen name few. get it‚Äôs mechanism - phenomenon.  I'm going say again. Haha America Bad updoots pls also try heard immunity??? Fuck me, fuck me. I'm mn land free. Fuck me, fuck me. winter going fucked.

Also parents insisted going bar bingo town. one mean one waiters wearing masks indoors. stayed have. (Once drink drive)

That's spreading rural mn. Also cognitive dissonance Stonk. Lets say made internet utility us Californians hope they're based water companies electric. PG&amp;E terrible example electric utility company. might help little lot things.

Masks help little person wearing one, help lot everyone wearing one. help protect everyone limiting amount virus spewed air nearby surfaces infected people. also help protect wearer reducing amount virus inhale. Viral dose could make sorts mandatory, masks important?

The Plow cost benefit ratio. piece cheap fabric every face significantly reduces transmission deadly disease no-brainer. people wearing masks, government test way people shut things results. ‚ÄúGonnaherphasyhillaids‚Äù per NOFX Anyone else read John Oliver‚Äôs voice? Fever good litmus test, help cull fevered folks places.

They set temperature scans essential job end may.  noon, stopped six people coming 100.4 degree fevers higher. One woman 104 insistent upon coming in!  1:1, help cull others. Imagine damage almost one wears mask. end like Scandinavia.  filters one-time investment. supposed use month replace them. They're $20. expensive per se, still disposable masks. need test (widely deployed) that's 90% accurate (false negative) one thing. Right now, test 10,000 tourists month, 5% infected, 50 people test negative arrival actually positive. welcome suggest yourself. welcome control others live lives. thought numbers falling London. rest UK that's rising. important disclaimer needs considered countries definition infant mortality. Countries report data disparately. United States reports infant deaths. Many countries report full term births, preterm births unfortunately die categorized countries basically miscarriages. death penalty massive percentage black brown women morbidly obese. fact. 4/5 black women morbidly obese, statistically speaking.

It's ""systemic racism"", lifestyle diets communities. Whites lifestyles see similar everything nowadays boiled racism. Great 0 personal responsibility/accountability No, countries mild flu seasons high coronavirus deaths. Lolol awwwe parents never take Trick Treating child? Never get invited Halloween parties adult? Poor guy. 20% fail comply inflict lot damage. see ""controlled spread"" something everyone wears masks, infections still get low dose exposure (like trace exposures) we're wearing masks. *MAYBE* time immune systems seen traces virus enough times longer ""novel""?

Definitely shit show that's going North America we're pool parties house parties crowding together sharing joints drinks without masks acting like virus exist all. one buying masks cheap days, marked Haha America bad uprooted pls Robert Redfield trash, destroyed CDC. remember reports. hope manages stay well.

I crocheted hat yesterday. :D. actually know - test could come back today - acting do, resting isolating. sore throat cough, nice. really does.

Maybe South Korea slightly better analogy, even still, virus tricky. tiny lapse poof back. try keep things controlled, better hope vaccine candidate approved otherwise still stuff slacker countries like US already basically reached herd immunity (not I'm advocating approach taken intentionally). Another load deaths caused lockdown guess matter. haven‚Äôt done math seems like ought like 15,000 getting infected get results I'll vouch Kwik Trips Greater Milwaukee issue... hometown enforce damn thing.

User posts r/conspiracy. Seriously. Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) Phase 3 clinical trial?

If so, blown blinding entire trial, entire clinical trial invalidated must start over.  not, cannot possibly know statements true. 

The standards trials based t-cell counts. based numbers diagnosed patients, minimum duration observe side effects.

At point, DSMB decide seen enough cases meet standards (or, trial cannot meet them).  then, anyone speculate. Parson repeatedly urged residents wear masks maintain social distancing, outspoken opponent mask mandates, sometimes appearing functions without one. July, speaking without mask Missouri Cattlemen‚Äôs Association steak fry Sedalia, reiterated stance. 

So he's dumbass *complete* dumbass. yeah, likely still 99.9% age, according swedish research Venezuela rampant curroption capitalism. Based one data point?

Switzerland, Austria, Denmark variable month month, left lot people confused wearing masks. essential introduce masks countrywide, everyone (with exceptions) wear get used it. Germany cases increasing too, much surrounding countries. often not, that's actual research gets compressed blown proportion every step removed original journal article.

Scientific papers meant consumption general public. written scientists understand specific language methods used qualify results. Examples phrases like ""associated with"" ""linked to"", mean two things correlated, one necessarily causes other. interpreting results, scientist might write ""\[strongly\] suggest X"" - mean X *proven*, means X appears \[very\] likely author.

Most scientific articles also report results specific. Something breakthrough one area research, area often tiny piece puzzle. Cancer good example - *huge* variety cancers, breakthrough, even already treatment level, may help small percentage patients limited degree. But, importantly, tiny steps add bit improvements time.

Only rarely science progress huge leaps, like physics early 1900s. even then, big breakthroughs always made possible small steps before, fleshed small steps afterwards.

In case, published journal *Science*, meant general scientific audience (rather researchers relevant field). That's usually good sign a) bar publication high, b) written way even physicist geologist able get gist it. That‚Äôs great know. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm poor enough Medicaid.

Most articles saying related 3 weeks Floyd's killing, maybe month, mainly big surge(happened right articles). many follow-ups since, looking COVID graphs, sure looks like that's surged 2-3 relatively stable months.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Exactly this. live Sweden one truly question alot covid-policies implemented here. one advantage social security system. child ill get 80 % pay stay home 60-120 days/year. can't imagine hard must parents feed families hence work and/or send sick children school. Dilemma. ‚ÄúRisky + ethical issues‚Äù right: wow üò≥ Ok, issue someone calling racist? think professor's comment offensive all? seems like missing point. form bigotry/prejudice still offensive. 

Hiding data isn‚Äôt exactly uncommon. http://www.badscience.net/2014/03/statins-have-no-side-effects-what-our-study-really-found-its-fixable-flaws-and-why-trials-transparency-matters-again/

We need things right away correct this. never able develop vaccine coronaviruses? Right? Scientists believe came bats nature. Isn‚Äôt eating bat (or capturing one wild sold food) possible route virus could gotten humans?  oh i'm sure evidence legit. i'm sure told.. 'oh.. know shit said years? would suggest tone down.. (as mentioned below, critic years).. maybe enjoy quiet retirement public appearances.' kind stuff. think is. pandemic started people [burning cell towers going people working towers thought 5g caused covid. 

Satire days anything sounds sane. mean suggest situation comparable.

The issues mentioned one reasons pandemic hurt certain demographics socio-economic brackets others.

It exposed tenous society Yeah man, lets fine jail people sending 8 year old school sniffles. Brilliant plan. run office. Yep, asymptomatic cases show strong rate could long term health effects.

Fauci told Senate Health Committee Wednesday, recent study non-athletes recovered Covid-19, shows MRIs ‚Äúthey found 60 70% indication inflammatory disease heart. Interestingly, relatively asymptomatic.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI think need careful watch happens one possibilities could develop, a) could clear up, problem rest lives,‚Äù Fauci said. 
‚ÄúThe things could wind inflammation, could scarring, could lead arrhythmias later on, could lead could lead cardiomyopathies,‚Äù explained. Parents send children school COVID charged. However, school district think would happen living reality. Parents forcing kids go school sick decades. Narrator: *OP understand HIPAA laws* 3M America make N95 mask. golden opportunity. I‚Äôm sorry virus originate China? given hope Americans ever understanding this. Decades propaganda caused stupidity. hope future generations wake see benefit social net. vary state. Eventually say ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù, can‚Äôt live like forever. Covid accepted one many risks living life.

I imagine certain states reach point sooner others. answer. someone who's getting master's public health, even controlling SES still disparities. Free maternity care great concept, research data shows us intersectionalities incredibly important comes health outcomes, know equal always mean equitable. models try help explain minority stress systemic racism plays health care, well classes graduate level try help us understand deep rooted social determinants interconnected things are. Blue range mountains That‚Äôs stiff competition large systems created equal. innovation needs done realm middle man solely profit expense others health. End story. top-10 wealthiest US citizens combined net-worth almost $1 trillion. Stop complaining life Reddit go march street demand UBI. everyone needs 8-figure portfolio, plenty ways build social safety net force people live life poverty. Socialism destroy Venezuela, US government want regime change raid oil fields got pants scared spring there's charges lawsuits pending yes???? Prejudice limited racism. clearly stated prob lying numbers doubt anywhere close us buddy.

i doubt 1/4 us china would easily lock ment saving economy fact faith china would shut shit swiftly. faith tyrants dont put peoples bullshit comes stability

the faith comes tyrants wouldnt let corona run rampant slow economy time us weakest. trust greed man No, new signage that‚Äôs sent stores, work said supermarket head office. That‚Äôs way I‚Äôm leaning, set different rooms house ‚Äòtrick treat‚Äô at. Maybe get cat dog involved handing candy lol Maybe said re-infections going happen like novel virus introduced and, thus, hospitals overrun (let's ignore hospital NA overun though issues). re-infections piece meal population based whether person carrying virus, person's individual immunity (antibodies T-Cells,) etc. break once. literally killed 200000 people still cheer him. 11 30m cases reach reinfection rare? *shocker* CCP trying make one think. fauci hates much Welcome half America. sometimes even do, essentially powerless due multiple years rights striped away (I'm glaring Wisconsin). hell downvoted this? virus gives people happy hypoxia. NEED monitor O2. US UK systems, yes, ppl assuming I'm comparing them. mentioned US Insurance thought implied comparison systems. 

I'm even trying talk healthcare all, large systems tend work, that's all. 1.) Lets say store touch surface contaminated. take hand correct youre mask. put mask youre face. transferred virus youre body.

2.) People always risk assesment whatever do. choose convinient way avoiding risks (wearing mask) less convinient way (staying home) might that. Even though less effective wear mask staying home. 

For example studies shows cars drive closer people bikes wearing helmets without. Wearing helmet COULD basically make prone accidents. mean mask helmets bad unfortunately COULD make people take greater risks. Thats need study things work real world lab. mention one knows long term effects might die today years result damage illness. Also first time get maybe did, get in.

My husband lost 36 year old cousin last month. medical issues. Nope. work said supermarket, we‚Äôve send signage stores remind customers this, pandemic.... percent positives county NC hovered around 7-7.5% range pandemic. Sending kids school seemed change figure number cases. Doctors, pharmacy workers, nurses get fucked everyone else. Despite literally making possible healthcare system exist. Lots traditional stuff (raw-milk related refrigerating things) skates Europe would absolutely forbidden United States.

Raw milk legal European countries, is, legitimately safe due strict standards. There's nothing inherently unsafe raw milk makes impossible consume safely. However, order extremely diligent sanitation. additional costs, terms time money, equipment, etc. comes factory agriculture, simply much easier cheaper pasteurise it.

Not sure mean ""not refrigerating things"". Eggs? Yeah, eggs actually need refrigeration natural state, strip protective membrane. countries that, like UK, countries don't, like Lithuania, home country.

EU countries also vaccinate chicken salmonella US doesn't. likely unmitigated HIT. thing spread quite ways infected person probably showing symptoms.  Honestly stand even presence fucking morons long Well listen science includes math.  China almost definitely lying numbers you‚Äôre naive think otherwise.

China essentially modern nazi Germany, they‚Äôre pure evil. course they‚Äôd lie. Sic em‚Äô Fauci said that? Cause definitely wasn‚Äôt me- check poster‚Äôs name make sure replying correct comment start telling someone said meant. Yes another new post day parts NYC ‚Äîin Brooklyn, Bronx, around Kew Gardens neighborhoods spiking again. Oh realize already got shot. thought looking volunteer. bad.  I'm optimistic most. I'm American figure elderly healthcare workers US probably start getting vaccinated either Pfizer Moderna's vaccine end year, help lot. least one (AZD, Janssen, Novavax) wide production early 2021. collective politicians corporations population get back normalcy, think expense spared getting vaccines general public end Q1. 

It really seem like hard create vaccine generates immune response virus - suspect that's J&amp;J's Phase II results show (as leading candidates couple Chinese vaccines). J&amp;J one shot vaccine also speeds quickly get efficacy signal.

As said, I'm quite glass half full this, I've reading mainly scientific journals (not news) vaccines really show promise (and vaccines pretty good chances success enter Phase III). There's enough decent candidates 5+ months Phase III data December globally think immunizing everyone wants one take anywhere near long 12 months. Rand Paul jackass. Take upvote. stuff feels bit like somebody trying take high road guy stealing bread feed family. Sure... \*supposed\* steal, fuck want people choices look like this. Maybe gave half shit other... Well, I've seen around neighborhood, would say lot things. lots neighbors let kids play together wear masks socially distance.

 One neighbor two kids. teaches school actually told looks forward going back week. pays private school. super religious, think may part way. says they're going wear masks class sizes smaller also said stir crazy home kids. Also think husband working home difficult. 

The neighbor newborn three year old actually said thinking putting three year old preschool. Also first time stay home mom think said hard time adjusting kid away would easier. Also stressing three year old's education already. asked I'm teaching four year old homeschooling. 

My neighbor takes care elderly parents wear masks around people kid plays kids well. normally let's kid run around neighborhood unattended. could go on. 

I know stuff I'm stay home parent people text talk sometimes outside albeit across street. one socialize let kids play. parents could go specific examples. 

Our county high terms community spread. take situation seriously. watch window neighbors BBQ front yard mask tons kids. invited go. 

I think partly denial also involved lady wear masks says worries parents flu season virus. 

Anyway, aside education levels, vary amongst group, hope examples show people things lots reasons. certainly agree them, they're stupid shit opinion. stay fuck away them. shitty situation right can't control people make think right thing affect us. things listed important things fucking moron. Trick treating important kids want candy. Go trick treating shitty parent don‚Äôt care anymore sub fucking joke. whole system broken. Maybe finally force change. Work everything. Taking care family vital. Yea, fine. opening door standing could risky. yea, bowl porch fine  Five whole days? 24 hrs 10 years seniority. It‚Äôs easy person‚Äôs director. Essentially they‚Äôre overqualified lot jobs might ‚Äúgood match‚Äù director openings there. Clinicaltrials.gov huge portion state actively fighting even simple safety measures politics.

Wild people willing fall sword pretend Trump idiot lies care die.  elementary school kids first attended teachers this. remember sitting classroom PT conference seeing lists instructions taped wall. names, kid(s) asthma, diabetes epi-pen requiring allergies. ask, I'm sure taped could student read directions loud child. doubt daughter class, would seizure response instructions wall, too. 

On plus side (?) teacher actually right room. Yeah, pretending masks big sacrifice exactly got us first place.

You're way coddled. know. Surgeons known long time face masks stop reduce droplet spread viruses bacteria. say beginning face masks harm good effective whatever straight lie. That's point.  Lmao predictable No, we've quite restrictions since Mars/April. bit lighter based voluntary action rather enforcing law. hand, we've also kept pretty much restrictions since start, level ""opening up"" many countries. USA garbage. Mexico school television. hard USA thing? country full fucking idiots. wife never job paid sick time. 10th employer 20 years. masters degree. aren‚Äôt jobs! others pointed vaccine 100% effective people saying need socially distance covid vaccine.

Do agree that? normalize this, then?

I know, think change brought upon societies like one live in? teacher, get schools don‚Äôt perfect attendance awards anymore, never sending kids school even don‚Äôt feel good. kid who‚Äôs parents didn‚Äôt send kid alarm doesn‚Äôt go off, parent never sends kid school decided go ‚Äòbeach day‚Äô even teachers tried contact multiple times concerns child‚Äôs academics. basically meant way motivate kids overcome deficits created parents. Staying home week would bite hard ass force work extra hard catch flu still deadly

no not, coronavirus causes covid much ""deadly"" influenza virus. still social distance ‚Äúprotect grandmas‚Äù?

the coronavirus causes covid novel pathogen vaccine yet, hope helps experts saying 2nd 3rd quarter 2021. that's optimistic. What's baffling caught COVID earlier. guess politics important life. feeling sick (not covid simptoms still sick) parents send school lived too. Even virus, almost women many men wore masks outside. that's new them. wore mask went outside protect sunburn riding motorcycle. left sub early pandemic simply typing word president got comment pulled politics bot. locked threads unbearable. Apparently active sub actually cares covid again. stopped. Mortality rates fallen due better treatments

True. Even fallen much thing still far deadly flu infectious. you, apparently. spaghetti squash season I'm loving it. also social worker type monitor kids might getting abused physical, sexually, mentally home. I‚Äôm classed high risk it‚Äôs literally shopping...
It‚Äôs difficult I‚Äôm one this. Even didn‚Äôt underlying health condition I‚Äôd pandemic.
I live busy city social distancing difficult. see people picking noses wiping faces, taking precautions whatsoever ones legally forced too.
Those people touch everything anything washing items you‚Äôre bringing home sensible way get though pandemic.  Yes, interviewed got job. many deadly novel pathogens don‚Äôt social distance for. country screwed cannot even imagine logical reality live in. depressing... Great points üëç Ah good old cognitive dissonance thanks warning  special kind moron.   taking measures stop preventable deaths?

that's good question, we? work then? legitimate question, need inform lol socially distance lockdown flu?

because vaccine, novel pathogen  knew would happen. We‚Äôre fast forwarding death tolls point. seriously, give job help people provide positive contribution society. become cop? caring point? Easy peasy:

1. state barriers health insurance competition
2. Create malpractice injury fund remove litigious nature healthcare (which drives costs).
3. Remove tax benefit employer provided health Also, European countries afraid tax wealthier businesses citizens kind rates used tax wealthy kid, means tax burdens spread fairly US.

Yeah usually around 20k so. last bad flu season US years ago 60k. target seems point Or, less goalpost-moving words, Denmark worse Sweden. That's vaccines work. India's current positivity rate around 7-8 think. 

India currently average 1million+ everyday. months they've worked increase capacity they'll try keep increasing. However know impossible get tests/capita figure 100-200k/million india like present countries. Ofc india prolly highest number cases, many undectected.
The good thing infection level quite mild infected recover  Right, rare disease contracting, however common disease killing hundreds thousands yes even thousands younger people too. one said be, think appreciate razor-thin profit margins entertainment companies large venues slaughtered pandemic economy.

Nice little irrelevant detail. fail, new ones startup. Vast difference entertainment venues going bust, stuck indoors next even mean

So know vaccine flu that's 50-60% effective yet call job done flu prevention.

Covid same, idea socially distance, go lockdowns vaccine like people bandy hypocrisy finest. 

When happens largely return tweaks. Sure people may WFH, may even people wearing masks sick. socialising, within 6ft people return.

There definitely corrupt politicians China one big difference people East Asia really afraid viruses. 

They original SARS epidemic death rate much higher.

Japan, Taiwan South Korea experienced SARS immediately high alert COVID-19. (Korea also experienced MERS recently)

New Zealand ridiculously isolated maybe helped?

An absence anti-science culture like said also important. Also seem far less people trying ""stick man"" following guidelines.

However European countries ample warning refuse take seriously day. People still allowed go vacation, spreading virus over. European, live consequences, infuriating. 

It continues make lives complicated makes hard see friends family. top really damages economy. vaccine approved US Europe rushed. I‚Äôm American. short answer is, yes, individuals pay services. 

If insurance employer, family, state (Obamacare, basically expanded basic insurance poor people), costs somewhat reduced, baby hospital comes big bill. Every exam co-pay. Mine $75-105 per visit. can‚Äôt pay medical bills, ruins credit.

Literally, hospital dad patient, walks people doors says ‚Äúgood luck‚Äù they‚Äôre disabled one advocate them. vulnerable people actually get connected meaningfully helped social services. don‚Äôt insurance, hospital can‚Äôt profit care, homeless disenfranchised patients scuttled shelters let loose street. 

It‚Äôs completely fucked. meant said America first. Regression edit shit - maybe website changed title. fact censoring information that's simply unwanted. Yeah one get fucking medical care Yeah we're still working remote too. companies offices open people wants go in, discouraged. 

But people getting depressed. Limited socializing months taking tolls. Without vaccine won't. like 150 vaccines developed now. diseases reinfections working vaccines, affecting vaccines much, might mean need shot year sth like that, per life like Yellow Fever. party 100 kids socially distanced everyone gets covid (unknowingly) party... bubble. go back stores, ect. wearing masks. would different 65 yo neighbor getting (unknowingly) going grocery store mask on. simplistic measure money ""free"" currently. example Denmark less bankruptcies previous years time back March April. 

Looking government debt Finland Denmark loaned double compared Sweden, half population, essentially 4x loaning per inhabitant similar results.

Sweden: Total cases 200K 1316 deaths.  
1340 people hospitalised 630 serious condition (down 670 yesterday). 
About 60K tests done yesterday positivity rate 11.7% 

The virus completely control here. don‚Äôt understand this. people ok waking bandana, isn‚Äôt ok wear Halloween mask? Assuming mask cover nose mouth... live Mississippi excellent insurance. wife great health conscientious pregnant (she wont even eat deli meat tiny risk food borne illness). 

We still born daughter two years ago. obviously 5G...  I'll speculate high rate infant death birth defects US due aborting known problem pregnancies.

Are early miscarriages also counted infant death? Solme hospitals insist burying lost pregnancy even can't even tell tissue baby. don‚Äôt. tell women heat deli meat hot dogs never mention cases listeria cantaloupe. France recommend pregnant women don‚Äôt eat salads may washed thoroughly enough. Everything tell women America pregnancy garbage. Insurance pick bulk costs basic delivery. believe becomes complicated surgery required aid delivery. Everything charge America's healthcare. God forbid get cancer, shitty processed food diets sedentary lifestyles mostly guarantees lot people anyway. screwed over, know proud of. Freedom? lot nations freedom healthcare. fail see America somehow unable make work. Unless corruption deep, fixing now. can't even get basic facts right. 

China's population 1.4 billion. 

That pool party held months lockdown finished - I'm guessing eradicated virus within country. 

Otherwise would let people stage pool parties - seriously think Chinese government would allow wet rave go ahead COVID-19 still circulating population. Dumb speculation. I'm pharmacist guess might even existing drugs side-effect main purpose. Norway finland less economically impacted lockdowns Sweden herd immunity strategy. 

It's hilarious denied herd immunity strategy deaths rocketing past neighboring lockdown countries they're boasting high death long covid tally. either necessary unnecessary‚Äù valid argument. necessary‚Äù completely disgusting invalid argument.


In end death inevitable, physiologically common final path multitude diseases conditions.

Stillbirths tragic sad sometimes (or always, depending philosophical view) necessary. else happen fetus already formed growing example absolutely unfit life? We've heard almost people Sweden lives Stockholm Swedes comparing failures Stockholm mega cities like New York Rio. Sweden's CDC know extent swedes following guidelines. think guidelines √§r followed sufficient enough hold spread might dangerous give recommendations risk changing people's behaviour.

In addition, recommendation wear mask also recommendation wear mask. Lol, sneaking suspicions. teacher talks one another like that. love people lie prove point hold dear? Obviously, lie prove point, point worth nothing begin with. regret jerk before. seems like real interest research writing stuff. really look becoming medical researcher journalist something proper research methods sources rather trying Twitter. Best luck. Whataboutism make point, untrue incorrect. Sure, USA issues, CCP garbage lying people incredible scale. Lets cases 2 billion population? Even lockdowns restrictions insanely low Ohhhh...so type mask matters now/again/forthefirsttime? locking muslims simply religion putting internment camps. better argument? 

Source? What's happening faith Chinesee govt honestly report cases and/or test.

Well...they report cases. tried covering lot covid.

Like what? Natural immunity happen too. vaccine stimulates what's already there.

'Herd immunity' 'want' happens. 

With vaccine, get herd immunity fast save lives otherwise would die virus. honestly havent fair chance job interference administration though. 100% true. 

Medicaid CHIP cover prenatal care.Every prenatel provider knows program. massive profit center hospitals.

The knee jerk assumption problem $ simply wrong.

From NIH:

The common causes death United States 2011 following:1

Birth defects

Preterm birth¬†and low birth weight

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)

Pregnancy complications

Accidents

I'll speculate high rate infant death birth defects US due aborting known problem pregnancies.

For worst health status mother pregnancy

Tobacco use pregnancy

High rates early elective deliveries

High risk births hospitals inappropriate level care

Sleep-related deaths


Poor health status mother translates obesity. Tobacco use surprised me, culture electively shorting pregnancy. thing college bubble. Colleges exist within larger communities. students go restaurants bars clothing stores grocery stores faculty staff campuses live community. almost belongs r/nottheonion Thank update.

Quick Google search shows vast majority US states overall rate UK. Remove four US states - New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut - so, overall rate goes obviously. 

Some seemed sure places Texas, Montana, South Dakota would way higher deaths per capita, happened whatever reason. fucked reality United States government actually spends health countries universal health.

The reason pay much can't afford treatment minor issues, minor issues become major life threatening issues require extended hospital stay survive.

I watched cycle happen many times family. shorten mom's life significantly, given dad debt fully expects pay dies.

While nearly always tragic family, may unnecessary easily preventable(for example perfectly healthy fetus whole pregnancy, preventable mistake labour big consequences) necessary effect result example early genetic birth defect.

Of course, genetic defect unnecessary, that's unpreventable 'accident' that's nature rolls, producing stuff killing unfit specimens.

In analogy bear missing. (I believe) I'm anti herd immunity anti casedemic idiots, support this.

This classic example ""bad socialism"". government imposes burden solving problem entirely people disproportionately harmful, largely ineffective way. Largely rely fact police power, abuse instead fixing incompetence.

Governments need build solid testing, tracing, isolation reporting system. need devote right resources, also organized competent way. aren't. DMV running pandemic response.

So impose restrictions fines. Typical US governance. know numbers low - think doubtful nature disease.

Beyond irony. We're moving Canada. America dead. gf follow rules. Can't stand country anymore. Hopefully next year happen.

The two thoughts incompatible. feel wearing mask infringement personal freedom, still wearing sense civic duty.

Thanks trump is, politized everything masks vaccines, we're never gonna get mess due lack trust US government become Soviet Union. unfortunately, people batshit insane too, probably *some* good reasons reporting them. Let guess party belongs to. Need vaccine protect us debilitating math problems disguised innocent comments. chance doubling risk death go zero (or near-zero depending effectiveness flu vaccine)? Sweet mother fuck hear argument one time. always say confidently like truly believe like 10K died *just* covid (also sure even point favor). I‚Äôve definitely noticed people walking around without masks on. sustained level COVID infections deaths keeping people reopening least partially, general population intends as.

Ask anybody outside states masks seen impediment personal liberties, beat first wave COVID, tell they're emotional laugh face. Lol! true. Maybe put going doctor believed Covid-19 would disappeared by......... vaccine confers 100% immunity. 98% record, MMR vax.

The first wave cov vax 50-70% effective. feel like coming months learn much long term effects COVID anyone good source excess deaths data US? CDC oddly took data website (stopped tracking since August 22 even though found record dating back 2017).

I think important data actually realize bad COVID-19 been. fact, March 1-August 22, experienced 243,406 excess deaths. essentially true value number deaths due COVID-19 since death predictions typically spot on. Scary think we're month later meaning closer 300,000 deaths current mark 200,000 that's reported. editorial comment, another one stories though emotional headline, buries key fact last 214-bed Lady Bellefonte Hospital closed May, leaving King‚Äôs Daughters Medical Center Ashland‚Äôs sole hospital.

So area near capacity half capacity closed May.   open em up! Tell governor newscum stop playing evil dictator day let sheep go graze suns still out! Lets take lives back! Lots answers % mask wearing. that's question headline was.

Here's [direct us/canada neither questions exactly, related: Canadians 43% Americans believe required wear mask public places violates individual freedoms. Odd thing. last 5 doctors advised get flu shot. asked got said no. deaths, possibly permanent cardiopulmonary damage virus shown cause even young, asymptomatic people. novel virus; know kind long-term damage body. think kids losing one Halloween better alternative potentially shaving years lives. 

Also: kids dying, even much smaller percentage. Would let kid run around street unattended cars drive road? 

Finally: kids miss Halloween sorts reasons. children get like, 12 Halloweens? They'll upset night tell can't go losing experience missed one years Halloween. That's probably happen. people reuse disposable face mask weeks months now. Basically 2 deaths lockdown 3 covid. Also quote article posted. sure referencing.

""However, report concludes 41% deaths result missed medical care rather virus itself."" No? Airborne droplet viruses new. verse you, virus spreads. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs money end day. professionals holding accountable paychecks. perspective, look Pierre SD. shut activities due outbreak relaxing little early.

There's plenty new age hippie types going 6% thing There‚Äôs always office! There's also big difference supply types masks available compared then.

Also, US education dropped 6th world healthcare also 27th see well that's working out.

Freefall like sustainable, next generation notice can't even Canada ranked significantly higher US. Asian restaurant go online order system built plexiglass drop box doorway entrance.

There way people around person know status. ad-hominem. one saying ""If X, people would said Z"". one calling NZ pathetic. see hypocrisy here, surely?

Also, Gold standard != Perfect.

No one said NZ got perfect, certainly anyone NZ. made lots mistakes continue so. - - make many mistakes everyone else. believe focussed problem, rather popularity TV ratings.

History judge things believe current US administration judged harshly.

Shrug. confirm late night walks: Shoulder shoulder idiots bars That's bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see pays end. People seem think either Sweden miracle place there's pandemic everyone intentionally murdered depending agenda. Truth is; Sweden restrictions, restrictions Sweden themself admits probably soft, spiraled control several reasons trending right direction, seen ""there's need add restrictions"". Since Sweden think restrictions somewhat soft (though stated long time ago now), surprising that, gets bad again, time that.

The lack nuance Foreign media/peoples discussion Sweden ridiculous haha  aren‚Äôt wrong. :) overall deaths strictest period lockdown, deaths relative number miles driven up. I‚Äôll edit comment add thought.  Virtually nobody affected. manufacturing capability crank billion per year. I'm sure people understand huge development J&amp;J actually is. 

It's huge. :) Russia China already offering vaccines world. Well 10k probably everyone dies covid counted. Paywall free link education system primarily daycare system.

There sticky post subreddit volunteering. especially need individuals ethnic minorities. Sending sick kid school stupid sure, unfortunately lot parents likely making decision forgoing pay watch them. federal government allocating funds cover expenses parents sick children. 

This complex issue think government needs incentivize people make right decisions You‚Äôre saying words many completely meaningless.... like you‚Äôre parroting stuff you‚Äôve heard people say something.... 

Regardless whoever parties, stop.

This actually huge news gives lot hope we'll start see widespread recovery sooner later. negotiate doctor? insurance involved? I'm noticing assume I'm Republican?

Now obviously cautious family go much can't visit. 

Life going move forward point. choose comfortable level risk situation. Fauci lied greater good would without health workers? N95s, even cheapest blue masks scarce time Fauci made lie mid March late March really, stated early (or less) measures might needed. far interest journalists loosening restrictions last months development europe changed that. Even free care, Black women much less likely seek prenatal care. need massive outreach community educate encourage prenatal care, far Black women doctors could one key social distancing key factor then. trump similar line comes measuring covid death, test deaths. guess so, screaming minority ones super spreaders ones grabbing eyeballs world.Shows nation poor light.Dies help President like Trump knows nothing expert everything.

Clearly bullshitters see liberals same. kind moron U. Cinn hiring.

Le Reddit cures COVID--AGAIN! Good him. insurance, already paying fat people's health care.....Fat people insurance too.

And like ""No fat people"" carriers.

Not mention....Medicare covers LOT fat people pay already! older get, slower metabolism, etc etc. long thought penny-wise pound-foolish re: covering younger people therefore let things go fester make 65, cover years neglect full force health far worse helped sooner. maybe pay care Medicare taking care younger.

Luckily OB got set hospitals infusion center IVs 3x week, thankfully $45 copay per visit (but $45, three times week, 9 months adds quick). healthy enough work medical costs, still struggling medical debt 3.5 years later. can‚Äôt even consider second child likely sick can‚Äôt afford another $10k hit bills.

Malpractice insurance roof. long time, medical school graduates basically stagnant meaning amount doctors 1960 US population 179M 2010 309M (I believe started increase past 10 years, quote me). one worst diets 1st world country; serving sizes gigantic idea salad laughable.

Polio, MMR, TDaP? cheap. remember taking youngest insurance years ago. paid somewhere $500. think 4 vaccinations morning, roughly $100 plus visit cost. insurance that's different story, here, pretty much try best live outside healthcare system costs high otherwise. even plans--I plan one time ate 1/3 income premiums, deductible, ever met it, would amounted another 1/3 income. Basically, slightly reduce cost medications generic thus already cheap, provide backstop permanently financially ruined one us got accident. phone autocorrect anything. Obviously I'd never spell supposed ""supoosed"".  Oh look strawman. original. kid needs grow thicker skin quit whining. things change November, hopefully finally start approaching wartime effort. siloed approach crap. 

I agree people fined knowingly this. That‚Äôs happens knowingly start forest fire. Jesus fucking christ. sounds worse virus. 0 deaths 2 hospitalizations.
 
Maybe, tell whole story. He's saying previous mild flu seasons meant vulnerable elderly would've died past seasons didn't. corona came around excess vulnerable people still alive death toll covid19 magnified.

It'd still shitty way look it. case. Foreign media's reporting Sweden ridiculous, blame anyone confused misinformed. Lockdowns preventing free movement peoples outside time war Swedish constitution, mandated lockdown never possible Sweden. Sizes crowds gatherings still limited (else they'd shut police), bars follow protocol certain rules (else they'd closed), High schools universities closed etc. (universities still things online, exceptions things need campuses) etc. Ozone great sterilizer. ozone air means dead virus particles. get certain layer even won‚Äôt hit. nothing care you‚Äôre trying take even more?? Im sad him, think he‚Äôs going risked warn world, look now. remember plenty Americans early days saying reports must fake. hope stays well, glad see update least located alive. hate idea someone **they hate** might get something need.

If point state oppossite, people hemorrhages, sepsis etc. originally cancer, counted cancer deaths primary reason, that's people saying, list cancer/cardiovascular disease/diabetes primary death reason covid. underlying conditions make covid symptoms much deadly compared healthy people far often would survive. How? please go detail? I'm talking lock-down here. course particularly vulnerable take much caution can. However, 'one size fits all' solution masks distancing much possible. applies 16-year old well (and others) said, 16-year old's choices may end impacting 80-year old mentioned could easily made right choices stayed home. happen number ways (16-year old cavalier, gets it, spreads friends family, end getting someone else sick, person works nursing home someone helps care 80-year old). Again, definition pandemic individuals willing take risk. act like protect one another (not saying lock down, though, simple measures work). ever here? ago don‚Äôt remember bed ridden longer hospital 2 days. Lifting/work restrictions month so. would definitely ask doctor concern though, say can‚Äôt walk dog week perhaps Rover could option?

Doctors much better current multi-layers admin staff, thank you.  still manage practices without. expensive unecessary waste money amount hospital admin. could less, lower salaries admin. could patients example money saved.

There chart showing much admin numbers salary increased hospitals last 20 yrs.  medicine become super complex?  Nonsense. Another reason DPA invoked earlier N95 mask production... lockdown 4 months, destroyed economy (more) , this. Reddit wrong lockdown, news 11. Guarantee anti-maskers droves kids maskless costumes. *can*, common. kids? randomly get 104 fever nothing else runny nose. Sounds like good advice someone living apartment shared AC air. make sense house unless housemates. Doctors surprisingly bad reading understanding lab results. [Washington Post worth read. Yup, hell, may carve little army something do. would know this? absolutely ZERO evidence! Canadians intelligent people.

Sooooo much proof failures keep convincing locked down. fact, feelings, person. *really* think anti-mask parents defiantly droves kids dressed maskless costumes?

Also, way kids college getting sick can't socially distance, there's way Little Timmy gonna socially distance hopped candy soda seeing kids about. Must rioting. /s When? Better increase internet prices make it.  Yeah , taken year

Seems like stating obvious Lockdowns delay inevitable. worry, I'm sure Americans find way make vaccine politically charged mask.

I'm serious. person, something wrong get help. much though? seven figure range. broader theme. hospitals fountains, overpaid CEO's, piles unecessary admin staff....meanwhile underpaying overworking nurses doctors shaking poor uninsured back door?

I say america's biggest food problem doritos, pointing ludicrous comparison is. can't absolve discrepancy situations saying ""let's play oppression olympics."" 

There real differences problems, QOL developing countries often incomparable living U.S. completely, wholly unnecessary compare realm. speaks someone's lack knowledge life areas world make comparisons. That's I'm pointing here. Comparing walking miles go store buy plentiful food government's dime literally able eat cannot get food again, ridiculous. shows someone lives bubble privilege vs actually understanding world is. would highly suggest reading situation feel need make justify comparison. Perhaps frontline account would good, would suggest reading start exist U.S. need come close problems third world countries someone try fix them.

Please, become informed topics choose speak about. way run problem future, argument diminished ignorance. American urban suburban design failing model. examples like Atlanta Beltway, funded give green space access lower income families‚Äî guess what? rich neighborhoods trails developed first, decade later lower income parts yet developed. America‚Äôs rich mastered siphoning resources themselves. Honestly it‚Äôs safer abort kids put lifetime parent. Well, think I'm placebo. I'll still try see happens. best halloween costume hazmat suit choice valid. made similar choice dad (unconscious) hospital. doctors said would hard look didn‚Äôt want last memories that. remember man life. Sadly Spain reached infection rates higher US :( would seem national vaccine mailing / self administer day might work. mail everybody vaccine (if one need cold) live broadcast TV give vaccine. Football basically meatpacking plant Let‚Äôs assume you‚Äôve written isn‚Äôt exercise creative writing:

Surely implied privacy someone sitting toilet work. looking crack see toilet? burdened HR complaints? serious problems healthcare system? COVID-19 first started, cases, really significant number. think rushed approval election day much concerned about. Many pharmaceutical companies public health officials made clear would compromise science, idea Trump might circumvent political reasons nothing speculation point.

I would trust vaccine scientifically demonstrated safe, regardless political views Trump election.  Wow, .01% infection rate going dare try give kids proper education?? Frys closing bunch locations. think they're going though, they're owned parent company Kroger Ralphs unlikely they'll go away. likely they'll close underperforming stores reorganize influx cash brands. implying orthodox neighborhoods can't wealthy? Please look real estate prices areas. area cited expensive far Rockaway, includes Rockaway beach park, even area could considered expensive. People sue healthcare mistakes mistake accident, one ways get money correct via lawsuit. happens venues too. 

Universal healthcare would strongly reduce need magnitude sorts lawsuits recovery medical damages. According CDC, SARS-CoV-2 airborne Tuesdays Thursdays. days either drunk high airborne... /s

Really though, CDC even credibility left? don‚Äôt speak doctors.

Neither you. European countries ample warning. contradicting warning. saying virus dangerous China pandemic happening back saying fine. doctors saying pandemic dangerous. confusing times. countries thought reasonable: put trust China. worry. problem fixed. Trump changed admin password. assume support idea school systems open point refund tax dollars many paying towards facilities closed pension plans point earned? school something close nurses: office staff would say weren‚Äôt qualified could lay ‚Äúnurses office‚Äù 15 minutes, go back class. Eventually room turned storage bed stuck like sore thumb walked office Tell Karen army delinquent children. **Keep information quality high**

Your post comment removed due low quality information. vote science experiment see helps makes things worse. seems like brainer. either helps, makes things worse. helps, great; makes things way worse, advise people stop eating foods high linoleic acid. Hey ever happened rapid testing parking lots walgreens, target, walmart announced back may? disease elimination? Absolutely. help reduce pressure hospitals? That's enough. Yeah, agreed. I'm far doomsayer vaccine skeptic possible -- think data shows plenty reason optimistic, think people around screaming vaccine approval Trumpist ploy complete morons summarily disregarded. welcome clarification looking for, publicly released interests transparency, incredibly reasonable.

Waiting median 60 days s/p booster drastically impact course epidemic -- Pfizer hit like 50 days, example, still great. Interestingly, I'm actually curious severity rule; use corticosteroids great job preventing clinical deterioration, again, 5 cases severe COVID-19 still reasonable...

Overall, hardly impacts timelines meaningful way; reasonable requirement remotely difficult meet. people going think makes difference people insist benchmarking vaccine election day fucking reason, absolutely understand coming anyone. obviously extremely rare given millions people infected March April, 99% survived, we‚Äôre still 11 confirmed cases re-infection.

There 11 cases reinfection; rather 11 cases proven. 

It proven person's virus genetically sequenced times two different strains (to show remnants first infection). 

The amount people genetically sequenced strain, multiple times long enough apart ""millions."" even then, counts two different strains. told anything. second shot greater reaction. little reaction first shot. felt horrible hours second one.

I highly recommend clearing schedule though second third article explain it‚Äôs drug/alcohol use poverty. 

A statement ACOG acknowledging systemic racism field obstetrics medical journal, study racial discrimination adverse birth Systemic Racism Affects Black Women‚Äôs Health Epidemic Racism OBGYN ...paid? Hah idea. Could give us detail, requirements payment?

I'd happy free guess imagined mostly going twice per month shot evaluation. I'm assuming process complex.

And dang hope feel better now, that's heck fever. anybody surprised? people can't afford keep kids home costs day work; even jeopardizes position work missing work - especially tough times - looked poorly upon managers. top that, anti-maskers people refusing contribute overall health communities keep kids home they're sick (which should, even normal circumstances).

I made bet friend focused long school would stay COVID closed all. guess stay open Feb so, omly closing wave infections hits big family Christmases without social distancing/masks. many nurse serve 600 students special needs work. modern day slaves either work send kid school sick lose job go hungry homeless. Cant blame parents kids options. Lol. counter-argument cherry-picked statistic country one lowest death rates world? A+ work Guy.

(honestly, embarrassed) health officer, arrest corona? ü§î could go General Grievous, case hacking covid cough would seen part costume. look excess deaths. like 40% more. Send em home two weeks. Done. sister lost baby little 22 weeks back July. felt terrible entire pregnancy point incredibly stressful baby silver lining going on. wait til Covid vaccine costs $50 (minimum). wealthy protected, I'm sure design.

You really think wealthy afford $50 dollar procedure? agree covid vaccine free acting like 50 grand, 50 dollars. God bless Finland. you‚Äôre staring loss job, eviction, groceries, car payments, etc. that‚Äôs harder choice be.

Sorry, that's hard choice all. kid's going school, mom/dad going work.

Everything listed falls bottom two tiers Maslow's Hierarchy - Physiological Needs tier, Safety Needs tier, respectively.

And, Physiological needs tier \_may\_ come play twice, kid receives free/reduced cost meals school. kids get ""good"" meal \_unless\_ go school day. Yup, thinking yesterday. Colleges basically incubating disease 3 months Thanksgiving sending everyone home kill parents grandparents. 

This sad christmas disastrous thanksgiving unless college students get right now. Nope. live Wisconsin, I'm well aware what's happening here. number others thread making comments suggesting think Wisconsin broken record states. Death rate lags. Also doctors treating awhile getting better treatments. Plus could old sickly hiding. need hide anti maskers play. want apology President too? future, honestly EVERYONE behave act. way get back normal again, guys.

I honestly feel good wearing mask, even alone bathroom taking shit, know i'm right thing masking up.

When smell wafts face gets trapped cloth fibers, think brave men women Del Taco preparing food earlier day bother anymore. fact, wave air face hands intensify smell order show solidarity. serious can't take chances shit ALL, guys.

Like gf gives bj mouth mask. causes little bit chafing rug burn that's NOTHING compared brave men women there. We're #together we'll get this, guys! don‚Äôt universal healthcare. maternal death rates like third world nations, let 40-50k people die lack healthcare lack affordability healthcare. lifespans stalled going backwards vs first world nations staying rising curve. fine parents do. Daycare teacher here, parent drop their, Autistic, feverish child, 7am get pissy crying endlessly squirming floor 11 screaming wants go home parent leave work early. even economically crushed area either. kids parents defense contractor nurse practitioner nice hospital. PTO money keep home didn't. 

So knew talking opening schools majority parents option inclination keep potentially sick children home would death thousands teachers students. Wednesdays special though. It‚Äôs cross checks made Death registry. 

But general, yeah. shouldn‚Äôt take week register COVID-19 death. 

But I‚Äôll always take accuracy speed. Pfizer, creator Viagra. hurt confusion shit. solution relies 70% people behave ethically going fail. would me, maybe understanding bashing trump saying first Democrats blocking travel China places racistthe media political agenda misleading people mean study ideally placebo group. Yup started morning. asked day early

Spain phase 1/2, surprise there's also phase 3 starts there, US likely still higher infection rates go bit quicker. 60 day rule place FDA, earliest approval works states would likely December. always dramatic? cause politician say ""lets open economy let die"" done, labeled monster, say ""lets kill economy save people"" hero paper blame killing economy Oh plenty come back time I‚Äôm sure. New bars, maybe different ones, maybe like old ones... certainly lots corporate owned stuff new creations sure.

It‚Äôs people impacted interim worries me, ability get tattoo press shirt 2022. Yikes; someone dreads flights sometimes avoid far away destinations due flight time, incredible me. Also expensive. can‚Äôt charter Cessna buzz landmarks far far less $600-$2500?? 8 new confirmed cases Hong Kong yesterday.

All domestic asymptomatic carriers recovered! Fuck Canada socialist ass. Wow, drop since May? TLDR: 10 new imported cases, 0 new domestic case, 18 new imported asymptomatic carriers, 0 new domestic asymptomatic carrier

Translation:

From National Health Commission China, yesterday 22/09/2020 00:00 - 24:00 , 31 provinces (including autonomous regions direct-administered municipalities) Xinjiang Production Construction Corps report 10 new confirmed cases COVID-19, imported (Guangdong 4, Sichuan 3, Tianjin 1, Shandong 1, Henan 1) . new deaths, new suspected cases.

For yesterday, 8 COVID-19 patients recovered, 277 close contacts longer medical observation, number cases serious critical condition change.

Currently 168 imported cases (3 serious condition), current suspected cases. Accumulative imported cases 2,758, accumulative recovered imported cases 2,590, accumulative deaths imported cases 0.

Up 22/09/2020 24:00, 31 provinces (including autonomous regions direct-administered municipalities) Xinjiang Production Construction Corps report current remaining cases 168 (3 serious critical condition). Accumulative recovery 80,505, accumulative deaths 4,634, accumulative confirmed cases 85,307, current suspected cases.

Unfortunately, people don‚Äôt even know AIDS either. actual lock-down though? Seems like people still go outside whatever agree you. really bad campus actors terms outbreaks, colleges employee millions people provide leg better jobs etc. many millions more. COVID dangerous... said, think allow society wither vine it. intervention government keep things afloat little choice reopen roll dice. think losing bubble walking discussion away actual subject: COVID precautions. like go ahead similar things done flu, sure not? again, talking wearing masks, maintaining distance, washing hands flu season protect one another. I'd say lot already done Asian countries. matter fact go look data flu season Southern Hemisphere winter year practically reduced zero things done COVID. bad? Again, let's focus COVID. always wanted ride parade float, chuck handfuls suckers jolly ranchers kids. everyone shows symptoms SAE means industry?   news today: [Face mask sales surge Sweden country warned may advise people wear would need masks beaten coronavirus? believe kn95 ear loops counterfeit. CDC statement months back, it‚Äôs dead giveaway. Non counterfeit respirators headband straps.  Let guess?

Online Bleach sales? Yes awful happened *woman*. read somewhere Pfizer prove 50% efficacy 32 infections would need 26 control 6 treatment.

I assume test similar chi-squared, testing ratio 2:1

Pfizer going Hail Mary first reveal. odds unlikely. later reveals likely successful. ;) see executives‚Äô profits look identity politics drive us civil war Trump one encouraged type behavior base it‚Äôs negative connotation freedom. imagine non Trump followers won‚Äôt wear mask haven‚Äôt met yet.

If swift decisive response right beginning include strong statements WH regarding need wear masks whole thing might largely behind us now. (holy run sentence)

Just $.02 doubt, go look Singaporeans to.

Their govt actually quite repressive developed country, also sensible capable. rarely get wrong issues like these. ""We agree civic duty... course value life"" -US Fucking Yeah, hope implement Australia well. Hotel quarantine joke, Murdoch press keeps pushing reopening everything way soon. thought meant Washington, STATE. live Canada right Washington. ASSuming everyone page dont even use D.C end showing USA ignorance. Thanks though.

I expected actual blown asshole much covid lower intestine. isnt political thread coronavirus thread. means 7 months coronavirus killed 450k Americans. Let sink in. way worse Spanish Flu numbers strict social distancing mandatory closures months. numbers still high. it‚Äôs still yet. Honest question - mean 280k ""secondary"" deaths PLUS 210k direct corona deaths? Sorry no. Imagine trump got cases zero, suddenly uptick month later. Liberals would lose minds saying he's failed us blood hands. Also cases literally zero tiny island population 4 million kinda pathetic Yes. can't blame you-know-who Europeans wearing masks, legacy social media talk much.

Despite reddit would believe, Americans stupider average. worst, they're louder. find 1200 bucks 6 months covid-19 related lost income totally american. lol!!

Meanwhile businesses got nice fat payments, yet another bailout, tent city central many people losing homes.

&amp;#x200B;

Not even particularly lethal virus yet collapsing empire cards rather quickly. care b/c really one them. accepted could say black Republicans.  image means nothing without context involved it. know said democrat conspiracy harm Trump's election chances rest world also sacrificing people cause reason. You‚Äôre antithesis fun. Right, understanding virus changed things. DFs recommendations changed too, have. Everyone else mentioned kept singing song. can't wrap head around that? deaths lag 3 weeks, 2 months passed surge deaths EIDD-2801 promising therapy candidate researchers familiar drug candidates. 

But people? 'people' heard of? Ingesting bleach. UV lights shoved butts. hydroxychloroquine. Every day I'm thankful Karens Jakes kept far far away med school. Shoot. I'm game.  that's it...or asshole disorder Imagine Americans sense civic duty? Imagine?

Signed,
Proud Canadian It‚Äôs lack oxygen masks /s

I feel /s required current climate identity politics about. also works favor executives running oil gas companies, tend Republicans. 

It socially engineered get go, media general.

The way affect giving Republicans incentive, actually understand, allows place sustainability higher priority.

There people paid lots money design models used shift status quo toward interests wealthy elite.

There two kinds people arena: define axioms used push ideology - regardless _they_ actually think they're saying, actively dictate decision making opinions based framework established ideology. 

That _limits_ capacity see reason, provides flawed narrative operate in.

Sometimes flawed narrative useful. case, obviously isn't. Yes empathy towards elderly 5 governors sent infected elderly back nursing homes killing tens thousands. COVID JOKE ""exempt"" wearing thin piece cloth face go out. Jerk disorder?  extreme might imagine. yet anyway.  1) still eviction moratorium, can't afford rent getting put street 2) lot multi-generational households putting minimum food table probably manageable many. Unemployment benefits highish consider cost living.. keep roof head without paying rent probably first thing skip paying.

Now still 15-20% unemployment moratorium lifted, likely reflection crime stats.

I imagine many closed businesses done primarily due cost commercial rent. market looks like support small businesses, hopefully previous owners small businesses &amp; restaurants return innovative fresh ideas. afford stay HI, anyway. pandemic lifetime opportunity kinds graft cash grabs. ain't gonna pass opportunity. 

Competing protests scheduled throughout Bangkok next two days, btw. Let's fun thought experiment illustrate importance reading test results. Say live Phoenix get Coronavirus test comes back positive. test 20% false positive rate. odds actually coronavirus? literally expert said always entitled opinion. Well said essential activities. assume means bars, gyms, entertainment, etc.. 

And dont remember country reacting flu anyway similar way react covid. thing flu know PSAs staying home youre sick coughing elbow. none social distancing masking everyone like covid. Old habits dine hard. American, please downvote Well, look found something similar think Pelosi wants see much get number given Trump‚Äôs apparent willingness play ball. It‚Äôs Kind hard know exactly gone behind closed doors, suspect there‚Äôs this.  200 thousand dead. CDC anti-fun surprise. Alberta Random stranger who's asymptomatic accidentally spreads droplets candy. passes said candy hundreds children, bring home parents. unlikely understand might cautious. course not.

Who ever said would?

This isnt McFukin'Donalds...this life.

Vaccination also guarantee immunity virus mutates. wonder many deaths caused lockdown.  wrong, even know start. supposed stop droplets, gas molecules. exactly come conclusion? Lmfao spread pretty rampant. Every mitigation don‚Äôt disrupt every life country. sort amazing gotten much attention. suppose potential profiteering low mess HCQ blame. Well someone wears it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs hurting anyone else, don‚Äôt see problem someone chooses too. One doctors makes whole staff safety glasses safe side. USA bad! *Jeb Bush Please Clap* Canada alliances outside US. Also, tar sands worth it. dont even make profit is. last study read, based research supercomputer Japan calculating aerosol behavior, suggested face shields nothing aerosols. great stopping ballistic droplets, obviously, aerosols easily escape open sides bottom face shield. Masks, made materials like layers cotton, trap large - total - level aerosolized particles within weave. imperfect, make difference - degree illness directly related amount virus one exposed to.

The molecules carry odors nose vastly smaller virus, smell food good analogy. Smoke is, particles smoke quite large - much size coronavirus. 

The complex molecules carry smell food 100 times smaller coronavirus. coronavirus 120 nanometers size. glucose molecule sizes 1 nanometer. molecule carrying smell of, say, fruit, would size 2-3 nanometers. Super small.

Coronoviruses molecule machines - unliving atomic robots, basically. 10,000 atoms across diameter. still much larger molecule scent apple 50-75 atoms across (depending rotation - molecules 'round'). ""That's cuz Canadians pussies."" - number Americans

Source: American. Around Americans daily. usually come later, mods sanitize narrative future archiving. Welcome echo chambers. collect messages like Pokemon. That's one yesterday. :D Shocker....items China meet standards....it like saying water wet. it! You‚Äôre number #1 gorges worked pharma, trust something fishy US government almost asking ignore things like SAEs. No, stem isn‚Äôt important. main focus primary education outside box problem solving. STEM generally taught regimented way thinking. Well flip flopping masks needed root cause that....pot meet kettle mr fauci. third world country known Amerikanistan.

The rest Earth knows good 'common sense'. major reason goggles unpopular reason scientifically based  browsed page quickly nothing struck Breitbart-esque cares N95 masks? Cloth face coverings better. even help immunize coronavirus help let small viral load in. Enough produce immune response, enough produce symptoms. ways work better vaccine. things mentioned COVID, masks, distancing, hand washing certainly apply flu I'd say see implemented many countries every year. say anything closing everything? reason lot done first place unlike flu, certainly understand COVID still really. course knee jerk things done good science shown us needed degree basic things done protect other. 6 months actually. AMBA (This includes Buenos Aires City part Buenos Aires province sorrounding city) seeing slightly decline cases two months flattened curve high level. whole rest country face like three months spiking cases likely colapse (healthcare system way poorer AMBA) remember, WITHOUT lockdown card. 

Personally expect less 30.000 (in total) deaths next month half. record, U.S. handed pandemic well, 25.000 deaths proportion us (we 14.000) one anti-mask Ozzy fan PAYING ATTENTION.. worth it. Sure, cases close zero (roughly equivalent US 100 cases per day). may well return zero (equally may not). Given US 30,000 cases per day, think safely say one response effective other.

If want compare behaviour NZ administration US administration, wilfully deluded. Wilful delusion president pretty much lot different fields. likely get results failed candidates first.

This great point, thanks sharing it. happen know odds vaccine approved? 10,000 NCEs tested get 1 approved? words, companies cooking books, type failure rate expect? shouldnt masks mandatory forever? Doesnt flu kill like 40k americans every year? Several people put thread one also said apparently it‚Äôs closer 85% Well risk health system collapses let unfold. bit crazy endless protests health system lot sick people. already lots proof southern hemisphere flu season basically non-existent. Thanks info, answer question. good day. asked someone pull mask nostrils exposed basically covered moustache spite. don‚Äôt think realize dumb petty look. ""Oh, second wave larger first totally fine! Despite supposed knowledge, gotten big weeks, still growing. well handled. mean, deaths mean long there's another country more?"" - Typical Danish argument country's controlled burn ceases controlled. It‚Äôs fucking hell dude Fucking right! love god damn country! China's end: Depressing, ain't surprising. Chinese quality control remains meme day; though given very, wide gulf parts China basically first world; parts China basically 1980s, weird methods certification corporations need come ineffective lawless regulations (see various Shenzhen tech companies view copyright vaguely enforce amongst other), we're probably going seeing quite longer. buyer ignorance (not realizing Chinese companies government actually list certified aren't, mentioned redditors here), ain't like rest world gives damn. really give damn high quality American cars usual trash Chevrolet, buy 'Japanese' (almost certainly actually made North America anyways) car anyday. 

On America's end: "" April, Food Drug Administration[ issued umbrella emergency use authorization manufactured China approved National Institutes Occupational Safety Health (NIOSH). agency reissued order June. "" Kinda dumb expansion NIOSH something check certify imported masks, specifically doctors rest easily blindsided studies like this. (well, American, Canada too) mask production ramp up; AFAIK Chinese German factories basically took one look ""haha make cars"" ""haha make bags"" went ""seatbelt mask!"" - want ask America can't this, again, maybe exactly masks fail. Michigan covid hotspot. Again, forget lockdown debate. I'm shutting education work. 
  
The statement comment reacted idea Eugene Henrietta would died sometime year contributing factors. Utter crap.  false, horrible way campaign moving towards less less restrictions.  clocking 250,000 excess deaths US point. said true number would fraction that.  

Also, keep mind tail end NYC's lockdown, 65% last round infections people personally stayed home generally isolated. Presumably loved ones, home healthcare nurses, people bringing necessities vectors infection.  no, know Eugene Henrietta pretty hard time protecting community lets covid run rampant.  can't shut cant shrug open floodgates people advocating for. 


I'm arguing reinstated shutdown (with remote learning companies laying people off) rather society citizenry willing function limp next 2-4 months Eugene Henrietta (if choose) vaccine available greatly increase chances either protecting making effects covid negligible.  owe citizenry.  


I grew outside NYC matter want blame much want talk nursing homes, ventelators whatnot sucked. childhood friend lost granparent's within 2 days (9 days getting symptoms).  total among friends lost 4 grandparents 4 aunts uncles brother lost 6 people worked years. family wife's mother also lost cousin. Obviously people young younger ones likely unhealthy definitely deaths door. vaccines available time.  Yet probably less 90 days seeing one even two roll out.  Meanwhile people want open flood gates done. like giving cross country track race right round final bend. know worse, colleges hell-bent making money playing pandemic high schools trying copy colleges pros without testing.

At least colleges testing players, even though goal profit. high schools playing testing, claiming everything fine US numbers keep growing. employer realises what's stopping replacing someone 3rd world country willing able job lot less money? part bullshit? stopped goal 6 months ago able go outside human right guess majority would say U.S. extremely loud obnoxious ‚Äúsilent majority‚Äù makes us look like assholes. /r/covid19 review fuck data. also trust Fauci &amp; Gupta's judgement Currently 12hrs sunlight vs 18hrs midsummar (June).

Honestly, even many anti-maskers left. exist, they're numerous. need people punch take frustrations on, get lots attention./  military knows wait 18 years entire crop babies conceived season lockdowns mature, point they'll plenty healthy recruits. then, make people available reasonably healthy.

To imply they'd avoid intervening offend one political clique silly.  US military perfectly capable screwing repeatedly. fed borderline conspiracy theories.

Ice cream machine? Still broken? People need stay go essentials Seems like comment reasonable popular (+100) arbitor I'm allowed think good use time.

Hilariously hypocritical given spending time... reversed argument somehow pure Noble. Lol Ventura County here, I‚Äôd say 95% people see wearing kind face covering (if always correctly). think Biden wins - absolutely win, chance Trump cheating - end January move get individual states start reporting data accurately, people stunned bad US. Right now, 200,000 horrible number, there's chance significantly higher. States like South Carolina barely even reporting data. going huge, ugly wake call. Even true. Compared Trump?? I've fought many non violent struggle come call ""proving people redeeming qualities humans actions get people killed continue"". work horrible little family business frighteningly stupid deserves south park episode.

These people blow mind. Pull up. take root. safety.  anti-Sweden brigade strong sub. I‚Äôm trying give benefit doubt initial trial much self-absorbed be?  number would like consider ""over"" thing watched TV sports anyways neutered part past 6 months. Considering local blackouts bullshit AT&amp;T like pull, easier illegally stream games want watch spend free time stuff. Good riddance indeed. Found Trump's account He‚Äôs supposed coach acts like star player. think Denmark handle quite well. honestly think Denmark catch Sweden's massive death count (one highest death counts ***entire*** world)?

I mean, fail quite hard one worst hit countries ***entire world***.
It's easy top country done well. every country capable type failure. Global News leans big right, anyone wear mask probably is, too. want offend base.   requiring masks overwhelming among Democrats, 89%, 58% Republicans favor well.

I'd curious see breakdown political party here. 

The problem US big difference two parties, 58% really low. er freedemz?! #Murica nervous 150, Pfizer looking 30 something initially lol Canada smart currency would used globally. even exclusive currency within borders. rich people get it. Seriously! last thing want see late night commercial looking affected reach law offices Blah &amp; Blah class action lawsuit makers first vaccine. take long time haven‚Äôt seen yet talking nationalism bad simultaneously praising people ""civic duty"". rooted nationalism. ""years""??? Another example poor reading ability, mentioned ""essentially 2 weeks"". get ""years"" way done now. wonder kind person I'm dealing with, I'm sure I'm wasting time here.

Uh gee, dunno, (potentially/)sick putting vulnerable risk, either risk lives going (even things needed live, rather entertainment part retirement), remain sheltered, denied entertainment part retirement... young able retire. Sure sounds selfish there.

I highly doubt stayed house 3 consecutive months, unless insane supply necessities, put risk frontline (disposable view?) delivery people.

The survivability could've even greater US benchwarmer took appropriate steps. can't die virus there's one infect virus. Instead, he's opening everything up. benjamins him.

But means, think like yourself, please go out, mingle/interact play russian roulette. may survive (a pity). question many people killed selfishness. Yeah definitely. BTW 250,000 figure Aug. 29. March 15 Aug. 29, recent date reliable death statistics, estimated excess deaths 41 percent higher official coronavirus fatality count. **If pattern holds, would put current death toll 280,000 looks careful one it.  really old habit.  best friend announced wife's diagnosis last night. Right I'm mood beat ever living shit every anti masker see.     400 bills passed House sitting McConnell's desk, including $3 trillion bill Coronavirus relief May even schedule vote for. yeah Pelosi's fault.  Also make sure pull mask chin towards neck push face mask. seated seal mask bites pressure agaisnt skin. Makes significantly better seal mask gripping face instead resting skin.   don‚Äôt care who‚Äôs first either, mean n = 150 seems like really small number verify results.

Particularly 150 include M/F, young/old, white/minority, etc   fought special variety idiot company. Even threatened quit. won!!! entire management team convinced face shield ""way future"". Bullshit. Plastic filter air. even need say this? mask: source control. 

I fought tooth nail nothing facts, science practised scientists. Ya know, hard corner morons show scientists public health officials (good ones anyways) advising exact opposite actually implementing workplace.

We allow morons wear face shield now. make morons management wear mask now. They're still morons, they're safe morons. genuinely convinced whole thing probably instigated purpose, way intimidate people cannot afford keep around balls fire. Like me. one guy gleefully fucking came office tell us take covid test that's work promptly refused much conviction wear mask ""covid free baby"". 

These people kill you, let them. Fight them. Yell them. Shame publicly, guilt people like facilitated tens thousands negligent deaths can't admit MBA count shit comes safety. 

I'm going whole catching Rona thing, bought enough air purification equipment replacement filters last 6 months, office door locks now. morons approach door wearing mask, knock, ask let in. I'm gonna break fools fuck clean air.  doubt I'd $100+ states. Well...many people put nursing homes purpose new york, correct. sure may something least get opinion dismiss completely. would principle &amp; would look it.

Sweden's method sucked got people killed needlessly. time wasted, could looked wanted see it.


You know go looking someone's source find it. also, could said read something else.

after source say also said Sweden hit herd immunity April.

but since agree read, figure wrong give shit accuracy. Ya too. also assumed free. free Canada. No, that's accurate statement all.

""acute respiratory distress"" pneumonia underlying conditions. comorbidities time death.

The fact accurately presented 6% time, doctors write simply ""covid"" cause death. 94% time, get specific.

That many got wrong shows strength disinformation US right now. propaganda machines put China's shame, imo, influence far world.  That's good CDC pocket. Can't violate rules none every directive caveated with, ""if possible."" You‚Äôd figure way get bucket back Yes must reason posting that. suggest, option trusting doctors care? Figure good option. Saying chinese built products substandard quality fakes racist? . Holy fuck, daft? like? Sydney back April so, allowed max. 1 visitor, thought lax already compared Wuhan.  im sorry forgot protest virus decides take vacation go bother people, virus recognize good cause let protestors alone. I'll give wanker Thiel, still disgusted, alot kiwis gave citizenship, even bypassing minimum requirements fucker so, thanks national party. bezos gates conspiracy influence NZ government covid response, nope.

And yes, know ""bunkers"", like thiels nearly 200 hectare land grab others various properties, fuck we've deal Kim Dot Com years now.

Also Bezos plane spotted Wellington, bezos, likely due fact amazon filming Lord Rings series needed negotiate government sort details quarrantine masses came it. note visit, lo behold crew staff descended onto NZ lovely little 2 week stay quarrantine contentious locally.

I asume world goes shit, (more) ride cause fuck you. countries contained it. ""science"" wasnt available. people don‚Äôt know won‚Äôt take moment understand excess deaths means science. However, whether SARS-CoV-2 infect immune cells clear. 

So, studies show macrophages infected.

We know severe COVID cases see T-cells depleted.

We know antibody production suppressed almost COVID cases, many mild asymptomatic.

I see confirmation older theory.

Antibodies help, might even hurt, innate immunity matter either. COVID defeated 10 days symptom onset, innate immunity T-cells get hosed. leaves cytokines last line defense obviously damage they're worth general.

So, think matter T-cell mediated immunity. know young people would robust response there. also know older/more severe cases see antibodies. Maybe there's ADE cross-reactive humoral immunity?

Just checked - kids see macrophage depletion - mean, think, virus spread point get involved heavily, get infected, deplete. (A severe case would see happen T-cells).

Apparently kids high T-cell levels thymus proportionally larger compared body sizes adults. So, think key.

We know - unclear reasons - cold temperature might cause T-cell counts lower. So, would achilles heel COVID immunity basically everyone.

SARS-CoV-2 also respiratory disease causing virus. trademark features respiratory viruses including biochemical features sensitive cold temperatures.

Yeah, think ""apocalypse"" thought would happen, materialize - COVID arrived winter ended. trying say then. produce mutations. occur randomly natural selection merely increases frequency certain variants others.

What saying though, that, like take full course antibiotics, increase likelihood resistant variants coming forth. Comparing virus, selective pressure weak (e.g. poor vaccine usage), resistant variants likely come about. 6% stems fact

that president amplified bit disinformation, CDC never issued correction popular ""misconception"" made factoid stems prominent website. also said Sweden hit herd immunity April.

He say this.

I arguing right, sweden correct chosen strategy. wanted source claim swore hard mean, try split heirs pretty spot long ago.

No, wasn't. say thought Sweden would hit herd immunity April.

he say that. think Americans truly know civic duty means. Crack Coronas!  figure 50 people dying every day this? joke? u/wordscounterbot that, all. understand Bayesian stats. least that's peer-reviewed literature says. Nah, gonna sit locked home. life enjoy. like /r/politics then? No. Watch 60 minutes interview. Fauci knew Koreans Japanese success containing spread thanks part mass mask wearing. 
He tried retcon interview saying trying conserve resources nurses.

I know took stance blatantly disregarded potential even homemade masks. 

The science there. Asia jump us. collaborative global efforts would common effective prevention plan back Spring. would included masks.


Then there's twitter stooge could easily put PSA followers buy mask wearing, fears much losing votes leave things open disciples make misguided choices.

There failures angles. Fauci excluded. world view, preventative treatment less 1 200 chance die? big odds want there‚Äôs government intervention? 1 100? 1 25? 1 8? Well say want China fine ""made China"" PPE see article--where say that? Wow another good reason wear masks! /s Proudly incurious? come call willfully ignorant. Pretty cool idea...i wouldnt able (high risk) 3 stay masked, wash hands well...seems safe enough...especially ""1st showing part"". study referring to? link US version right-wing UK tabloid. Again....the numbers, whatever are, would *higher* masks use. Well example, peanut allergies rise US, they‚Äôre prevalent among first born children. believed sterilization children‚Äôs environments lack exposure pathogens. 

It‚Äôs kind like that. Yea that's meant that's point, point many 3rd world countries started way cases us able contain virus US supposed powerful country world worst world comes death toll.

Completely unacceptable. something. First article UK completely different health care system US even comparable relevant situation USA. 
So root cause reduced access health care, people fearing go get medical care, lockdowns? rampant spread CoV2 lack proper response. things would needed present rampant spread virus. Yes right, clearly remember Arizona sending New Mexico California never said solution cost reduction patient. said hospital CEO's salary going fix cost problems. may kick provider network want paid quality metrics suck. may run predictive analytics identify patients overdue mammogram identify patients high likelihood hospital admission next 6 months intervention. make sound complicated system complicated. private sector suffers either. Even Medicare Medicaid, state pick several health plans run programs, meaning health plan staff, increases administration costs system whole. states also require inordinate amount reporting ensure programs run correctly. Implementing ACA also cost health plan millions dollars due complexities program needed built scratch. fact matter is, overarching entity US capable managing healthcare system something would need built scratch scale back degree complexity current system. 

Many people healthcare trying decrease costs increase efficiencies alternative payment models. 
The fee service payment model encourages volume. Pay performance capitation models examples alternatives encourage collaboration across providers resourcefulness. areas could addressed immediately drug costs, increasing alarming rates year year. Believe not, lot people work health plans modestly paid employees care patient outcomes, go healthcare. understand frustration cost healthcare US - frustrates - proposing changes system misinformed think healthcare complex.

It's greedy school systems fault, parent last twenty years told kids school X amount days lose funding.

My oldest ran health issues even doctor notes sent us juvenile court due 14 days one year.

It gotten bad threats parents send wait call come pick up. daughter sick ""days"" getting letters threatening criminal legal action went five sick days, told go puke floor I'll pick up.

Feel free look arrests parents due kids absent. 1000 deaths scaled US population, really need bring US play here... PCR nasal swab test reliable test determining active infection. test could possibly want? Well yeah literally schools told parents It‚Äôs daycare, school bit afterthought. Seems many sub can't? want to? 77% upvoted right lol liberals regard Sweden failed despotic country praise measures pro dictators like Netanyahu, Orban Duterte. make lot sense would rather efficient tho That‚Äôs awesome! Congrats weight loss! helps give 2 minutes type workout (gym, running, going walk) you‚Äôll eventually full workout you‚Äôre already it! Hope great rest week! UW mean university something? fully open, like normal classes again? 

I‚Äôm states universities virtually ghost towns. undergrad classes online, honours/post-grad classes online. think republicans FAR responsible honest. dems passed heroes act May, actually pretty good bill, provided aid local governments, rent assistance, 600/week unemployment, 1200 checks, hazard pay ppp loans. thing could improved done small business grants 2k/month ubi funny 87% us say DUTY wear mask, yet employees almost every store go wear them.

I understand public (for part) really good wearing masks public places, employees work public environments, handle items store, see importance covering mouths. lifted restrictions colleges summer vacation. escaped time. Literally got Saturday. point reference, US 41000 infections per day 330 million people.

This means group 44000 participants would normally expect 5.5 infections per day. half participants got placebo, would expect, minimum, 2.75 infections per day. things based infection rates numbers vaccine 100% effective coupled antivaxxers also possibility us reinfected second time. College US sham. hope whole system collapses soon re-invented positive (and maybe even affordable) manner time right. ADV China / youtube  mean, also look *histor*y understand this. Humanity never successfully eradicated infectious disease Smallpox. People even still die bubonic plague every year, believe not. What's going right COVID-19 also family **Coronaviruses** around decades (MERS-CoV SARS-CoV.) course, viruses always naturally weaken longer direct threat large human populations, they'll still always exist nature wherever there's person latch onto. disappear.

Basically, unless vaccine high efficacy everyone vulnerable disease willing take it, virus always around. ability eliminate Smallpox (a 3,000 year old virus) came *extremely* aggressive global vaccination program set 60's. Part urgency knowing devastating (3 every 10 people got died painful deaths.) feeling 50 years though, Polio follow similar fate second virus we've ever eliminated. contained 3 countries right vaccination programs well funded. Bottom line covid become endemic around rest lives, probably longer. think perhaps influence you? fact made figurehead conservatives abroad. understand infuriating, mostly seems living polarised world openly talking individual topics seems difficult. thing this... 

- Sweden run ""moderate left"" government (even Swedish standards). 
- approach taken would possible without strong welfare system. 
- strongest criticism approach received Sweden far right.

For American conservatives promote Sweden example follow seem rather poorly thought through. Surgical masks N95s made non-woven synthetic fibers. guy argued PA would less death remained open liked Sweden. pointed Sweden 6 countries coming time (NY, NJ, DE, WV, OH, MD) Sweden also much better healthcare system. long term, 6 months, 1 year, 5 years, 10 years? term vague almost impossible define use argument Yeah, agree. considering numbers also need consider percentage positive. Survival smartest. fuckin retarded. players don‚Äôt wear mask coaches do? may biased I'm Korean I've wearing masks long ass time (and partly fashion accessory here), wearing mask contentious issue west???? one asking put full hazmat suit (yet), cloth mouth, bad go back normal vaccine. slowly roll things back infection rates go implement things significantly increase. vaccine isn‚Äôt guarantee anything fact become reinfected second time. need take care exact thing March. Barely take care things control ignore Many refuse celebrate devil's holiday. Yeah number schools done really good jobs reopening safely. It‚Äôs mainly big state schools trouble. 

In NC issue board regents whatever UNC bunch Republican ‚Äúpandemic fake‚Äù ppl politicized reopening screwed everyone over, guess private schools don‚Äôt need worry much idiots like lol  Actually, March, years deaths trending well average. would put excess deaths even higher. hear understand cynicism, *always* important take novel diseases seriously. People *needed* scared COVID back February, March, April. 

Our problems started mis-and-disinformation started spewing leaders holding public office, obfuscating conversation leading lot false narratives. People know believe anymore, happens, giving fear feel like safest option.  Disease always inevitable. Always, always pandemics always pandemics. always bacteria, always virus‚Äôs, fungus, yada yada. 

I also carefully worded that, said mitigation ‚Äúsalmonella‚Äù disruptive every single person planet. Lmao. I‚Äôm dumb one? üòÇ Good them.


Apparently honesty, plan fight deadly pandemics, keeps less deadly, results less severe economic impacts. Clearly Democrat Human Sacrifice, right? Isn‚Äôt think we‚Äôre doing? See go college Rhode Island, RWU we're mostly residents campus commuters get tested twice week, hybrid classes, person rotations who's class who's zoom. sports, masks everywhere go except sports teams practicing dorm. (I live campus apartment idk dorms). like 3 active cases. school Providence's College lot commuter students, report got said many commuter students tested positive. depends. Streaming services somewhat balkanized, different streaming providers claim assorted collections exclusive content. said, even subscribe to, like, six different streaming services (which excessive), still probably paying less would cable.

More likely, subscribe one two streaming services shows want, fraction cost basic cable. want watch something service have, maybe swap services; they're monthly subscriptions, change whenever. evidence seen bring doubt current Chinese data. data February March questionable data last 4 5 months. seem tight control worked keep whilst time keeping normal life economy rolling. alr-right moron mods really active /r/canada reddit anymore. actual alt-right lunatic subreddit /r/metacanada Yep, crossed streams one. Thank you, appreciate saying, letter saying anything nursing homes, except ""attorneys"" can't sue NY.

The letter like: hey, ran google search, found relatives name, well, sue China behalf? find revolting. 

Politics aside, find sleezy, gross, almost comical, letter. deal couple people think virus hoax. pointed entire planet can't trying pass hoax, get blank looks. can't fix stupid. he's ruthless. non-plussed attitude throughout pandemic, even lies looking American people straight eye, points someone already knows he's getting second term.

Which propose Trump sycophants Tim Wirth election fraud scenario playbook long pandemic hit, likely far back day Bill Barr nominated AG. legitimate reason college athletes high school athletes playing contact sports (that includes basketball) beyond money. 

Nobody playing outside professional bubble, NBA possibly NFL. Even under-reporting cases deaths several states, US averaging 800 **deaths** per day. 800 *cases* per day countries leads shutdown. still idiots walking around saying 'see, states playing sports nothing bad happened!' Completely ignoring massive outbreaks states like Kentucky Iowa specifically coming sporting events. dumbest motherfucker alive? N95 particle rated, vapor rated, entirely different complex rating system. Think painters resperators gas masks Top level source: links to: know need more. Literally two seconds googles.

Cheers - happy help! die 'car crash' 'blood loss', 'blood loss' underlying condition. doesn‚Äôt really scale same. $750 fine $50k year means bills might get paid. $100k fine $7M year means next nothing. Maybe hang Ferrari another year upgrading, something. Wait telling experts agree other??? oh gosh absolutely blown away!!! life-changing Revelations explain especially professors opinions covid? 

You seem ahead time!

""Obviously dumb thinking called expert"" that's cute. 

Interesting article Australian paper country experiencing severe lockdowns read article think would see overwhelmingly positive response locked Australian people. Another tough fact follow hey maybe haters go ""downvotes it"" lol. 

Compared Sweden currently. 
France 7 times many cases per 100k
Italy 10 times many cases per 100k. 

This expert attributes herd immunity. 
Care weigh expert opinion numbers?  want point shitload Counterfeit Chinese made 3M masks sent around world. would avoid places like eBay Amazon unless buy 3M directly.

Usually obvious packaging (spelling mistakes, etc). lied costantly months. tried pretend Covid even exist. Dr. Renita Cotton agrees. family physician Mallory Community Health Center Durant, works families inconsistent access primary care Holmes County, often distrust medical providers first place. work overtime earn keep trust, inconsistent COVID-19 messaging adds distrust, says.

**‚ÄúWe need evidence-based recommendations, leads consistency. need people manage healthcare crises healthcare people training so,‚Äù** said. ""In past clear evidence-based, recommendations evidence-based case. so, does, plants seeds mistrust community already always that.‚Äù** Fearmongering resulted women getting prenatal care need. Guess worth it, least stayed home risk infecting old person, right? Masks dehumanising, also make life hard deaf people, also emotionaly hard sexual assault survivors, hard breathe Let‚Äôs real. people trick treating Republicans won‚Äôt masks anyway. I‚Äôm sorry maybe CDC wants people think Covid-19 kind conspiracy could stop things makes seem like conspiracy. literally recommending nothing fun always seems conveniently happen things feel like getting better. Two weeks ago ate restaurant first time half year, mask. hell would taking masked kids around masked people get candy. Spending less minute place? None spread rampant all.

Because mitigation place. think aware disruptive mitigation measures are, since never deal them.

The diseases inevitable.

But stupidity is. almost flat, like way 100 times less daily cases similar level spring. Back like 1000 people dying day, 20-40.
Same situation France basically European countries - cases slowly reaching spring levels death rate magnitude lower

And 'second wave' going long enough deaths catch (you even say low number people ICUs) cfr =/= ifr Oh gawd surely even see argument phrase ""Doing X kill people, enjoy X, I'm going anyway"" great argument?

Like, decide fuck old people, care enjoying myself, fine, whatevs, maybe act like brilliant argument understand?

""Buuuuuut waaaaaaaaaaaant tooooooooo"" complicated difficult argument comprehend. That's reason we're trouble accepting it. get that, right? Imagine single &amp; prime, losing social/dating life 2 years. state full idiots. can't tell many people wear mask socially distance. go grocery store every two weeks everybody stupid believe real. ones wearing mask dick nose anything anyway. hard surrounded much stupid. masks work theory

They work practice too. lmao, yes ok, anti-maskers planning wearing masks anyway. ""warning"" cite Ministry Health Republic China ""warning"" much request information. huge spikes excess mortality correspond exactly growth covid spread hundreds locations finding correlation arguing die covid rather covid seems denial. excess mortality running 30 50 percent. covid looked back history books excess mortality used determine impact covid. numbers moment difficult people accept. I'm card carrying nudist wear mask nudist resort. Nothing else, well hat sunscreen, come on! hard. local Wal-Mart guy obviously terrible fire. ear. wears mask. wear mask ties top burned bald head, anyone decency would feel hella ashamed didn't. truth complicated. Masks work by:

1. slowing exit velocity expired aerosols.
2. stopping expired aerosols via inertial impact fibers mask. (there's couple ways work, we'll start that).
3. virus floating unencumbered. riding shotgun respiratory aerosols, significantly bigger virus itself.

The quality materials used work - lot studies show even cotton masks work slowing transmission.

Bring - let's dance, little anti-masker. I'm mood tango. actual deaths flu (as in, directly attributable) far less 30k.

Whereas deaths COVID19 directly attributable.

It's huge difference. I'm surprised getting upvote telling absolute true, sub loves bad news, like porn people. reminds March/April people differentiating NYC NY. Regardless, still believe possible one city country without borders get herd immunity. 40% arent immune people come nearby city easily get another outbreak, hence never truly ""herd immunity"" ‚Äústruggled‚Äù

I think mean ‚Äústruggle.‚Äù COMMON SENSE. Cause effect. really check account, worth family Downtown/ Winter Park since 1950's. shut two years ago dad actually holder second (I think) oldest active OUC account started great grandfather. definitely roots here, see skeptic. Lots new people coming going here. Hope last two months alright wish best, fellow Floridian ü§ô filter smells. really idea. 70% thing considered way high point, least large gatherings without masks (concerts, sporting events). lol - hard truths Spain lots European countries going second wave. yet know Sweden second wave. US still going first wave lot states, like NY appear done first wave, cases went NY could call second wave. People without cars. family uses term ‚ÄúBelichicking‚Äù refer anyone wearing mask wrong.  Good fuck monopoly companies used political donations prop failed business model. corrupt democracy. Nothing's changed here. I'm assuming colleges starting. course riots nothing know virus go protests riots, motorcycle rallys. course. Direct TV pay rubbish commercials. think might one people know flu is. hope never find out! Sure. alot countries struggling anyway. Why? Oh, absolutely doubt. Especially foresight January stock said first action benchwarmer shut international travel END January.

Staying home irrelevant. never been, shown help widespread becaussssseee.....? (would like say why, figure now?) 'Death' player standard safe everyone. multiple players whose careers ended due COVID, multiple deaths people came contact infected players well documented. Long term effects COVID yet known players themselves, players COVID pre-existing conditions future. 

If tested regularly quarantined, limited. high schools that, multiple states actively hiding cases. Surprise surprise, another lie.   That's confirmed cases. believe I've seen mortality rate US .5% &amp; 1%. discussions stupid generally give person benefit doubt. Shut fuck up. ‚ò∫Ô∏è It‚Äôs probably false negative, get tested knows still symptoms?  reading comprehension pretty shit friend. Better nothing  Lolol school announced opening back hybrid learning (parents choose send kids 2 days week) right Labor Day Weekend. Two weeks later, enough teachers we've required work school buildings since August (""accountability""?) scrap plan go back original ""end first quarter"" plan (end October) concerned. chance getting wearing masks social distancing low read couple replies down. wikipedia  Fauci apparently first class med school. random Caribbean med school; Cornell. That‚Äôs good them, herd immunity definitely option ensure community done earlier many places. signed waiver still wouldn‚Äôt let take ibuprofen without parent bringing medication present. Tell us more.. got warning refusing come son pending COVID test. policy stated report work COVID symptoms, family member must test positive COVID report work symptoms. 

My son 102 degree fever, negative ear infection, strep flu. instructed get test rule COVID. company wanted report office recieved positive result... despite doctor instructing wife quarantine got results. outright refuse come actually go manager's head end.

His test negative end took 48 hours get result. Correct. want news, website going give you.  Funny story, sad story. Work restaurant Arkansas. discussion group 12 walked 30 mins close wanted seated(only allowed seat 10 time) didnt want put mask on. last thing said left was, ""I'm Wisconsin!!!""
.... checked rightwing government. probably never. lived many decades there, I'm heartbroken see ever taking bad qualities US. Slowly surely.

People know gem Netherlands accurately used be. see fall provincialism, nationalism ""burgerlijke bekrompelijkheid"" might completely analogous religious conservatism changing Netherlands 90s global leader 1950s worst qualities without benefits. Absolutely nothing. people clue. condemn healthcare worker heroes? Aw, goodest boys! cute. Karma police would like word Lol. Nice country bruz love called Sen. ""Rand."" Maybe got Louie Ghomert's mask?

But worry folks, he's got best health care take away you. survive, shall become powerful could possibly imagine - Mike Parson probably Fauci also proof doesn't. listened Fauci NYC would still everything closed right now. yet experience real spike major openings, except communities throw 800 person indoor weddings without masks (and follow rules anyway). loosening oil environmental restrictions racism? guys undermine legitimate complaints empty headed accusations. Considering symptoms, wife's symptoms sniffles, doubt opinion changed. excellent taxpayer funded health care simply money.. always is. Fuck parents. can‚Äôt afford childcare don‚Äôt want deal sick kids house. Schools can‚Äôt even control lice, f- gonna control COVID? Knowingly exposing others covid19 need criminal offense. clear day people trusted. need mega thread this. wait?

Several countries now. Similar thing happened friends pre-school class. Parent put mentally disabled kids regular classes special needs classes operating half days. Someone watching kid times, cannot use bathroom eat himself, won‚Äôt participate. one teacher twenty kids, can‚Äôt get anything done she‚Äôs babysitting kid. older brother kindergarten. It‚Äôs kids fault‚Äî kind parents either, non children either class gain anything. kids could benefit special needs classes. so....are going blindly start trusting filthy fucking corporations now? lol. get real greenbets underestimate all, said start, that's kind person belong position great responsibility. coughing. stop droplet penetrating mask. People America paranoid taken advantage entire country built upon premise point actual policy differences Norway Sweden? I'm pretty sure countries available English hard find you. seem way knowledgeable me, lives Sweden, kilometers away Norway.... might add a) data recent week still incomplete; b) authors understand difference page reviewed data updated--it updated since Sept 9th else data week ending Sept 12th there; c) Imp Col London model already much maligned, first model produced, reference pointless; d) WSJ exactly go source mortality analysis--even right, balanced scientific sources; e) comparison case fatality rates highly misleading without knowing testing levels nation. That‚Äôs meant. agree give support means nec stay home. really staying home sending kids school sick. People means keep kids home yet still send sick kids school, jail definitely appropriate punishment. per capita? There's like 10 people Wisconsin. ...who understand basic concept humans spread virus? Rand Paul doesn‚Äôt proof Herd Immunity prevalent NYC. That‚Äôs Fauci trying explain. say Venezuela explain Norway Sweden Denmark today then? post removed because:

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* happening FL advice Health Department! ever assume wouldn't? I've seen this, never hospital workers, always residential care staff. travel nurses am, wear masks stores etc. range saw still 2-6 median around three.

It‚Äôs ‚Äòreal‚Äô number. teacher, professional opinion: duh. Shocker. Let eatch boris Yeah. looked like Clark Kent Connecticut unlubed butt plug jammed ass. Never thank you, asked questions ""Did good day bad one?"" snap hurry tries show art game learned. Love kids folks. can't herd immunity 22% infected. Please tell that‚Äôs true... words ""Underground Emergency Hospital"" greet arrivals, set among rejected string hospitals seen coronavirus wards hit capacity since government imposed country's latest nationwide lockdown Friday. lot people live single family households though, single generation, multigenerational. societal structure completely different professor last semester went med school Fauci-guy apparently genius even  It‚Äôs genes single official death, 500 cases could expect 1-50 deaths depending effected demographic, would probably hard say killed one officially. Granted also possible kill one got lucky  Again, matter does. market already knows. think he's moving market plain nuts. strange land indeed. CARES. 

If wanted address topics threads chance so. 

""Fearmongering"" word ""People take reasonable precautions interfere something want"". analysis.  Medical personnel gotten better treating cases.  Demographics changed.  people getting tested changed.  

Excess mortality changed hospitals got act together overwhelmed could treat people conditions like heart attacks.

Good example ""how lie statistics""  book everyone read. read again. hide test numbers cant hide death rates. Graveyard records across country consistent this. Again, still seems like someone agenda whoever Rand Paul is. calling like see. suggest taking step back looking perspective may differ yours. COVID would really fascinating dick. /r/leopardsatemyface Like education laws vile, written people clue schools like care follow effects.

So incompetence. Infected political issue. nothing really. Americans supposed do? sick day work? Wish those! Rand Paul raising uncomfortable questions Fauci. personally think shutdown cure worse disease agree Swedish approach.  don't. That's talking point. feel sorry anybody yourself. would like useful cant part vaccine trial look donating blood and/or helping running errands high risk people area. high risk household pretty much dont go really hard get items delivered. lot demand items arent even option delivery orders (toilet paper! antibacterial cleaning product, really stressful sick people home). Also things like propane refill, car registration, oil change. Also lot older people cant online ordering. feels like slipped conspiracy theories article lack technological understanding. would argue easily 40% Britons know poses risk, mean opinion due conspiracy, article essentially slips related. 

The problem lack technical understanding conspiracy theories. course would. option someone babsit child(ren) they‚Äôre working day? Posting visibility, they've successfully scrubbed internet can't fully gone. way people able hide behind anonymity, apparently couple even live Maine. don't, confused why. even doctor, dumbest people I've ever known doctors.

One guy bought AC, returned working, got another, complained scammed, walk apartment take look, thinking may installed backwards something. Nope, worse, sitting table heating room, never even realized put window.

Unless want doctor regurgitate stuff they've memorized experienced different anyone else. dad sounds like real piece shit. looks like Wisconsin &amp; South Dakota. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think pharmaceuticals would test vaccines, drugs, even face cream ? Administer dummy, infect wooden block see whether dummy gets ? Evidently needs government tell wear mask. needs get fuck office let someone cares Missourians take over. voted in, appoint last governor caught sex scandal stuck goober. Gawd comment pisses off. True tho. Oof... deny mass immunity 

Fauci points 22% ""mass immunity"" expert model, people think otherwise presenting bad info people.

Only people political agenda regard science data would agree position. Interesting delusion reframed ""rona real"" ""rona big deal."" Sort like narcissist's prayer. surprisedpikachu.jpg case fatality rate real mortality rate 7.7%

Yes excess death rate close normal walking flu season. Good lord fucking loser really needs saying more. finite number possible solutions (and any!) problem every failure shrinks list and, we're lucky, points us towards better option.

Covid basically minesweeper, I'm saying. quote ""You want wear dang mask, wear dang mask"". what? gonna say ""I'll pull back string"", thinking kids would grab run goods? Like freshman 15, it‚Äôs called Covid-19 reason news , study shows people buy snow shovels winter summer Except Sweden, Scandinavia locked down.

Lockdowns mandated social distancing. Actually, masks worn lessen smell dead bodies.  Also, YouTube tv raised price year $50/month $65. started less $40. thank you, I‚Äôm out. 

I miss live tv, fuck that. suspected related Covid Got mine! arm bit sore next day, nothing bad, I'm good now. symptoms. Haha America bad updoots pls mother nature decided killing others mean own. Hey keep dropping hints there, work hospital NYC hit really hard. recognized signs early got help asap. 

All raise awareness!

Thanks. Maybe stress related? news I'll tag According American scientists CDC, spread covid aerosols unlikely. Japanese experiments waste time. fact, contributes fake news conspiracy theories covid airborne.  lie: Mongolia, Patient Zero French diplomat positive, told quarantine, broke quarantine. ended infecting 3 people. F*** ""expat"" coming Europe United States. need go back shithole countries. mention fact government forced pay private insurance rates cover Medicare Medicaid. fact prices busted means even though it‚Äôs covering small portion population, costs overall paying everyone. TF MAH VACCINE? everyone think they‚Äôre desperate gut ACA.  one wants pay long term consequences pandemic seeing. Neuro consequences = expensive. good news though. Might render coronaviruses useless. sars, mers sars2. knows future holds. people, children homeowners, wanted participate safely thinking would relatively low risk activity?

All people longer able participate feel safe them. really hurts anti maskers point. Everyone else already gave up, anti maskers still going could pretty solid experience, instead cut drastically. I've flu shot one time honestly notice anything I‚Äôm totally handing candy mine. (Wearing regular face mask safety) saying that? guy drives special-ed class short bus? ITT: wrong science apparently Literally driving madison right I'll take place. worries man, thanks helping dispel myth Americans literally worst people ever. Wow actually pedantic link this? indication given significance, thing important, still nothing back 30% figure. think latter shitty credit score assets. 

Even person operated business corporation small tightly run company easy lender pierce corporate veil. large multinational difficult so. Honestly man, hurt close ABC stores. places literally right next other. Come on, guys, walk 50 feet. capitalism. whole society puts money people's health lives. Well unless currently Phase 3 trial getting ""first version it"" you? 

And unless frontline worker like doctor/nurse/teacher, probably getting second version either. people universal healthcare similar Europe? make sense. surprised parents wanted classes online. Anyway good thing. they're using long ones, also throat too. wish using shorter ones :(
Thanks anyway! wish they'd come sort grading system masks go through. 2 masks bought Etsy they're 3 layers 600 ct fabric. mother gave store-bought mask baseball team's logo it, breath right it, thin. Way back March *only* 15 cases... nothing worry there. Gone Easter. Hey man. need follow science read correctly:
Deaths occurred Sep 21, 20, 17, 16, 14 Aug 7. 
That‚Äôs 2, 3, 6, 7, 9 46 days ago. difficult, restore state funding, appoint administration views college public good, business. using long nasopharyngeal ones feels sort like inhaling chlorinated pool water. Unpleasant painful it‚Äôs pretty quick. places using shorter ones go nostril don‚Äôt hurt Everyone taking seriously doing.  swab looks way intimidating actually is. me, felt like water went nose side tested felt sore little bit after, really big deal.  get zero deaths corona, people start born corona. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs going. Facebook morons, clearly. Trumps gonna build day now... percentage Americans polled say thing Canadians unscientific poll. ok. Why? like we're actually taking substantial efforts control spread US, least states along border. Trying limit imported cases like fixing hole boat already sank. I'm guessing signs aimed mostly parents. kids rushed masks immediately tried put on, we're visiting aisle more. Since got lowest (224 2018) went high 260 come back around 235 now. highest +360 2015. Good news! I'm clear company's supercomputer discover this? /s Preventative care health education part healthcare, yes agree you. However, ridding parasite insurance companies profit healthcare would huge step mitigating many stressors people face country. healthcare factored tax burden saves everyone money makes everyone see doctor need one, unlike current system. Unwritten rule say anything called anti Semite live Honduras, payed around $10 x-ray; sure serious problems health care system, 250 x-ray crazy infected, yet asymptomatic shown cause lung heart damage majority studied. Pretty much people concerned it. death rate drops time due advanced treatments, organ damage main reason pandemic control. It‚Äôs falsified Spain France. problem people think wearing mask train store need protected. go pub bar 50 mates take mask off. That‚Äôs obviously works. It‚Äôs got acting smart (or least dumb). computer write this? appreciate love, sending back way well. must horrible aunt. can't imagine carry both. Must terrible her. Hahahaha oh yeah. high risk last beginning third trimester paying $40 twice week basically ultrasound (although looking specific markers)  moving direction based bad ah fuckface disorder I'm seeing 675,000 US deaths 1918 flu. 250,000.

Potentially country business operation worlds predatory healthcare sales system Well China got control too. realization new normal long slog cut it

Is mistake here? already said we're going back ""old normal"". winter reason lock down. would wonderful children dogs could used. article points it‚Äôs investment time hard scale. Still it‚Äôs good idea. try go network. Xrays first seem standard operating procedure back problems first resort. Every back doc I‚Äôve order xrays first, depending see they‚Äôll move MRIs form treatment. didn‚Äôt put going doctor. issue doctors putting appointments lowering frequency converting person appointments telehealth (source: pregnant). policies doctors limit appointments limit risk infection. baby burn

65,399 cases go get tow Sweden today Amen Sure, affordable life-saving health care, something better affordable life-saving health care -- FREEDOM!!!!!!!!! Chillax. Masks common all. Singapore decided mandate masks, gov sent reusable mask every citizen.

They super well organised. visited Singapore January. Thermal scans airport, standard practice since SARS. first case detected, hotel staff started wearing masks next day. Well developed protocol executed right.

As masks know? flu kills 200,000 people every year. Covid-19 gets 400,000 deaths year, we'll remember actually flu kills 400,000 people every year. bought silicone ear savers also work (slide hitting ears again.) far usually wear mask 4 hours time get break doable. Mabye surgeon general CDC misled people begining, presumably hord supplies... saying public enclosed spaces - mask use would make largest difference - people actually *not* wearing masks.

Smh. That's confirms pro-birth/punishment sex. religious, married couple could devastated baby survive birth, mother also risk could saved solution ""just die."" Making cloth mask pocket put paper towel tissue inserts probably better solution. counting cents?

ah dammit. that's get ya... countries successful virus,¬†their testing capacity enough crush first curve without lockdown.

üôÑ

Sounds like he's paid It‚Äôs less women going fear, doctors limiting number frequency appointments. bumper group reddit (I‚Äôm pregnant) lot women lots appointments converted telehealth scans canceled, etc, clinics limiting appointments pregnant women. people sub can‚Äôt take joke read ""wanking home"". definitely high definition feature. simulate high framerates. turn too, always, makes look like shit, artifacts.

I upgraded 50inch Plasma 2010 2019 LG OLED 55inch model. upgrade definitely worth see difference immediately. comment reported therefore removed. possible comments post break rules mods always read every comment instead focus reported. Please report comments break sub rules deal those. understanding it‚Äôs every country decides constitutes still birth, infant mortality differently, US uniquely liberal definition compared countries. numbers higher top that, Americans culture never seeing doctor unless symptoms. Fear debt gives us much anxiety going. _The clinical, epidemiological, sequencing data case suggest early re-infection SARS-CoV-2, 51 days resolution initial infection._

They sequenced virus cases. totally hypnotizing. Horrifying, hypnoizing. keep saying keep attributing success masks. problem hypothesis falsified Spain France. 

Your explanation seems masks doesn‚Äôt work Spain France really dumb, work countries smart. hey, drive airport get dog-tested. Correct. expat-driven like UAE (where live), deaths 400 7 months this. mortality rate. CFR (case fatality rate) deaths / total confirmed cases

Mortality rate much much lower, deaths / total population.

The important number discussion IFR (infection fatality rate) deaths / total (estimated) infected. estimate guesswork/statistical analysis determine number people actually infected never tested. CDC estimates IFR COVID around 0.6%, estimate.  first! Liberals duh. always right. think right rather strong social contract. Regarding masks: noone wears recommendation either. hell thinking.

Nothing. don‚Äôt ignore covid mostly don‚Äôt vaccinate also .

Big issue cram many people people small apartments houses . 

I sales rep buy brooklyn that‚Äôs great guy 11 people living small 3 bedroom apartment . 100% think it‚Äôs democratic exaggeration Uh surprise.... /s Yep mom worked daycare years. kid(s) come clearly sick enough Tylenol fever gone would set timer 4 hours could go temp 9/10 times right. military means state keeps economy going. state capitalism, free market. Besides closing schools Sweden closed high schools universities, measures basically same. Let's try find out. pretend know answer hindsight makes feel alot confident proper response. calls needed made earlier beyond me. knowledge pretend know answer surely would answer before. believe something done. believed earlier, again, know answer would been. So... reply YouTube credible source post another YouTube link. Bold strategy. Well another cause this, least me, always getting badly dehydrated around time elementary school.

Around time would start getting headache feel sick stomach, especially summer second summer.

The reason allowed bring drinks classroom, allowed 5 seconds water fountain break, allowed get get water class.

So know, hot day, 4 hours without water, PE means pretty screwed. willing bed nurses thought faking since literally every day times year. One eventually wised would drink two glasses water send back.

I'm amazed kidneys made school. highly contagious, aerosolized asymptomatic virus, enough. downright misleading government task force, including president, acknowledging aerosolized aspect it. fucking help though? government people shit job look bit rankled, though (justifiably so, confronted condescension lying) Reagan gutted taxes thus gutted socialist programs. Also women entered workforce slowly ended employers paradise underpaying level talent. Employees losing rights.  Sure meant like daily meds kid take.
But kids building virtual signed every year form giving permission nurse administer Tylenol Benedryl needed it. 
They never annual start year form students.
But beyond meds like they‚Äôd hold inhalers adhd meds etc kids medical notes. Yes, spot on. contact editor concerns immediately. dare write 10000 words fear mongering bs! Dang, can't speak spanish. That‚Äôs news cycle works. 

Negative news dramatic, positive news ‚Äúboring‚Äù covid policies also relied citizens abiding rules. guys way stronger social contract within community. Everyone part. Riding bus together? Okay put masks check date article? Vote! Attempted murder charges extreme, something curb sending sick children school potential life threatening virus. Yes, death percentage low, taken enough lives already sending sick child school sort reprimand maybe even help feel need send sick child school. 

No need gatekeep thoughts ideas children based whether child not. Especially circumstance. family friends teachers? Whether like not, everyone involved virus gatekeeping mitigate anyone good. But... why? government made clear don‚Äôt care. punished treating kids way government treats her? I‚Äôm American living germany 3 years now. course there‚Äôs people would abuse system, that‚Äôs inherent system. overall benefit society completely normal people helped system vastly outweighs negative effects tiny minority people feel need abuse mean like supervisor sitting 8 ft away dipshits like fight existence fact 8 severe symptoms could reporting bias even random variation, think likely explanation exposed higher viral load re-infection originally. honestly, 15 known reinfections 31.7 million known global cases much concerned about. still cautiously optimistic long-term immunity due evidence T-cell immunity coronaviruses, course let guard down. Agreed full, appreciate acknowledging it‚Äôs hard picture would looked like opposed bashing people without answer looked like. 

At beginning told friend scares ‚Äúfreedoms double edged sword situation wouldn‚Äôt surprise got ugly.‚Äù Fauci fucking pwned Rand Paul today. Gov. Phil Murphy (NJ) said goal get number daily covid deaths freaking mind? hell happened ""flatten curve overwhelm hospitals?"" apparently ""no one ever die covid again?"" That's quite high number, especially consider rural is. Wyoming like 30 40 deaths state half million That's good. better get young like chicken pox. healthy immune systems. Please. Please revolt. want live country anymore. keeps people gonna get hurt either others Socialism tool like capitalism tool. It‚Äôs nothing. need tools bag fix shit. took long time upload article. think wait get slides. Charge domestic terrorism. ""By power [Paul's former fraternity's bong mascot offered prayers to] Aqua Buddha, doctor power"" do. Yes last point -- GDP dropped sharply -- thing people need think about. could Sweden's economy take hit people really living completely normally? answer quiet majority Swedes social distancing, avoiding going shopping spending money, still are, since know safe. say could lockdowns US, economy would great, many people would gotten sick, untrue. It‚Äôs optics sad lot parents resort reality people felt secure they‚Äôd better employees.
But short sighted seems America corporate way. awful position. mean, like watering hose constantly gushing face lol. like, blow tissue, fine blow tissue again. hard concept??? say so. ‚ÄúFauci declined engage senator terms.‚Äù

Good Fauci. Yep, would never fucking idiots did. Australia lag. results reported every 24 hours. easy bring control literally .3% population dies (close IFR estimates). certainly dont blame navajo nation dont see place considered model That's nightmare. become medical emergency tell would kill go that? God, way safely give kids education. can‚Äôt think anything THANK YOU! That's is. Homicide!! know intentionally go expose others, likely cause someone's death point. Bloody hurry up. did.  It‚Äôs awful. Companies taken task there‚Äôs many waiting take job. It‚Äôs awful position in. No, security blanket makes us feel good. Nothing new. parents always sent school sick. Wanted ""tough out"" long possible could get sent home. Pretty much norm families lived Im American live Germany yeah course people abuse it, amount good society completely normal people kind System helps regular basis far outweighs tiny minority people would abuse it. Meth Arizona anyone without insurance year. Hope follow

Businesses support would reduce need sick days use insurance provide any. enlighten ed self interest. Preventive care saves society bunesses money see $ instead cost later..m what? mean parents send kid school flu, fevers, stomach virus, lice? parents? ones never help kids homework yet complain everything say teachers problem? thought parents cooperative, surprise. honestly think parents great really certain percent garbage care people. nothing class religion race, though guess wealthy parents could afford send kid school easily, know lot wealthy people still gotten transmitted Covid19 quite recklessly. know family sent nephew plane knowing positive, ate restaurant masks well. highly educated, one lawyer, mom nurse. Christians. Yet empathetic others believed everyone going get anyway big deal. watch Fox News concerned going lives normal. know reason why. 
Me thinking it‚Äôs shitty means pay rent? absurd.

Who pay teachers rent parents rent kid gets sick right thing?


It‚Äôs failing system we‚Äôve put much child care education system. virus get gaucho hat depending is. I'm aware study indicating effects temperature Argentina, there's reason believe study results linked replicated elsewhere. shit! point basically day care parents get jerbs keep economy going Fauci mask meeting? minor history. Come me. Gotta love made projections. They've always done this. new. news now. center 3 employees sick one child parents knowingly sent child us sick, dosed medicine cover up. going Panera pick order, job home health nurse includes picking food whatever need do. Haha math hard...

( 200,000 / 6,800,000 ) \* 100 = 2.94117%. even close...

Edit: Going latest numbers John Hopkins:

( 201,459 / 6,921,817 ) \* 100 = 2.91049% Sen. Paul's defense, never smarmy. wrong bonus first responders campus would respond incidences nurse wasn‚Äôt there, course trained health professional. damage (deaths, long term health effects, economic) could mitigated earlier US taken unified hardlined stance. I'm exactly sure would would looked like, degree damage pandemic caused could lessened. Yes. happening school.  guy came work sick last week bus 75 people sent home work. one douchebag didnt want phone sick. 

14 days vacation everyone one asshat. hope get tube. 201000 deaths assuming IFR 0.5 42 million. Even high IFR 1 total cases would 21 million. Add number people yet die. getting numbers from? Like always dad Ron thinks hoax too, weird think Reddit wanted office back 2012. nurse FFS! metric move goalpost. Osterholm top notch. America is, less. look stuff R0 measles 12-18. measles requires 95% vaccination rate, could beat Covid lower numbers (though depends vaccine effectiveness). varies school. used teach, responsible giving meds. nurse would write health plan, one carry out. kids take daily meds school, set alarm phone. much younger teacher time...school systems make much possible never feel shame it. We're mess people say things like hoax. proven SARS-Cov-2 changes *how* infects cells based temperature ranges. 

Link study, please We're mess people say things like hoax. Available Amazon right now. weekend.  Lots places, too. Mild pain injection site 3% times almost suspicious. weird almost always get some? Exactly this. covid top it, deemed medical emergency.  Hell pay? America? land consequences? Get real.  don‚Äôt see aren‚Äôt following guidelines... spread isn‚Äôt due canada raging parties wearing masks. I‚Äôd say 90% following guidelines mask sanitization along group sizing... sure else mandated point Yet Comcast still abuse me, long time paying customer. Still need one internet provider please... sister making candy apples spooky cookies kids. reason drastic u-turn governments masks? told wear 3 months line they're mandatory. Surely common sense masks stop particles spreading air. really take 3/4 months study figure? learn regards mask-wearing previous pandemics? many questions, many answers.

(UK based.) Ivermectin (in case wondering)  punish people aren‚Äôt sick?

Because get sick due risky behavior, pass virus others may die it, due fault own.

Why thread infested absolute troglodytes like you? really difficult understand? really care one iota infecting potentially killing people? mom used soft birthdays. She'd put poems riddles slip paper balloon we'd pop balloon get clue find next one. Hey, isn‚Äôt election takes place? Ivermectin.

People paying attention since March screaming it. showed promise since Australian lab studies. Yay! hope feeling better. tell boss internet stranger thinks ass. Hard pass. employers would insist workers go back unsafe conditions without threat lawsuit. would spread virus even more. They're pro-Covid party. didn‚Äôt take much start berating pointing fingers it, death count isn‚Äôt even close following Sweden experienced. 
Is what‚Äôs going thread merely coping strategy? NFL mantra go work go home. They're strongly recommended go anywhere else all. follow team leagues guidelines so. I'm sure; I'll research get solid threshold. you? there's one guy assaulted employee store telling wear mask drove got shootout police died everyone it... flu anywhere near deadly novel.

Unless is, *in case gets level attention* provide link that? know bipartisan group representatives working compromise bill number stated, find reporting shows Nancy Pelosi saying would block bill. thought phase 2? Nevada entered chat...

Not contest wanted win saw stat Yelp HI NV leading closed/dead biz race. time, maybe month ago, HI closed NV marked permanent dead. 

Now I‚Äôm seeing new businesses starting pop I‚Äôm wondering dispensaries selling days. Must strong. Wish em luck all, isn‚Äôt trigger I‚Äôd pulling time. people suspected covid health authorities give order isolate home 14 days. receive 100% duration isolation.

Is explanation useful? Yes. That's care people around us. Unlike selfish assholes dont wear masks. Like trump get 200 thousand americans killed cult members shrug shoulders stay knees. That's awesome, definitely helps they're isolated. Seemed like couple hours nowhere last time there.

Meanwhile, kid's school tens thousands students exactly zero distance community whose rate still hovering 10 15 percent. ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôre going nothing it‚Äù Anyway, nothing personal. scientist, fully respect you. players media see coming, get point. first ones vaccinated biggest deal.  Well bubbles obviously worked. NFL really hammered ""go work, go home. Every day""

This hammered coaches veteran players. Go work go home. need go somewhere 100% comply league requirements. avoid leaving house except possible.

I mean even 3 different coaches fined 100k nfl week keeping mask on. 

When billions stake owners league millions 100s players turns they're taking seriously. Thank calling bullshit, disagree earlier point negotiating. happening negotiating, first offer rejected second was. time 3rd offer middle. I'm also pissed took 4 months second bill. .00002% deaths I've never ""been fooled"", I've seen them. I've avoided buying identifying beforehand. Wow EXACT symptoms couple months ago around March. really high BP went doctor. would sweat lot would trouble sleeping.

Did take Covid test all? think quite intense that. We're already seeing natural herd immunity play communities starting low 20%. course, know exact nature virus, far strains acting erratic like flu, points type lasting immunity/protection.

From lot literature I've read, sound like we'll need hundreds millions Americans vaccinated reach herd immunity; rather got sick naturally already vaccinating vulnerable, we'll see death rates hospitalizations drop sharply. Living NYC, think that's barometer we'll using see ""social end"" pandemic begin really repair economy. Cuomo numbers guy infection rate falling 'normal' flu-level rate, hospitalizations/deaths low near zero, least third population agreed get vaccinated - think pretty much it. I'm sure things still weird like sporting events music festivals, I'm talking normal/daily life + moderate sized gatherings 200 less.

EDIT: Downvote for....being realistic honest? people actually think leaders major cities going say everyone ""hey, know 25% work, 1/3 small businesses shut down, gun violence reaching time high...but...we really need see 100% population vaccinated mask-wearing months get shot resume regular lives again."" mean FFS DeBlasio already getting lot flack stating ""restaurants full capacity Spring 2021 vaccine"" - actually agree him, I'm pretty sure needs middle ground devastation perfection. *be* economy return 'late 2021' that's aiming for. OK Canada, showing off. Thanks pretty much everywhere, worldwide. winter looming people half-assing precautions fear things bad. Well nothing virus changed since March terms estimated case fatality rate, sounds like generally misinformed. I've seen ""KN95 material""

That reeks weasel wording Danes ignore country burning favor pointing Sweden, despite Sweden fewer daily cases Denmark? Pope Catholic?

It's surprise Denmark's awfully mentality. Yeah way:

I'm wearing mask experts concluded reasonable based evidence.

Gov't telling wear shove it, general, also understand legislate minimum amount clothing public health purposes. know, narrative. point is: 

Its unfair poor districts quarantined gonna protest extend virus even thru poor districts massive protest. Wow.

That fits perfect logic third world country are. Thank you. Please, elaborate. I'm expert. anecdotal reports since beginning pandemic potential ACE inhibitors (some BP meds) causing severity covid cases. wife ACE inhibitor BP since beginning I've watching asking questions Reddit I've read lot. 

There's still solid answer moment last thing read paper looking depth using data around world. basically said there's anecdotal evidence Bradykinins might causing severity Covid cases Cytokinin storm. Bradykinin regulates BP theorized Covid gets involved Bradykinins become unregulated causes major issues including leaking blood vessels among things. interesting read nonetheless. Oh forgot. Basically true ACE inhibitor might exacerbate Covid severity theory currently. 



Source Abstract: got link talks vitamin potential tie Absolutely. Shocking explain someone influenza deliberately mutating annually keep ahead man made vaccines... I'm Canadian, agree poll, polled. anyone know. Diseases inevitable. lot people put lot effort every day idiots like go daily life without getting sick, luxury making idiotic statements like ""diseases inevitable"".

But sure. Let's let legionella, salmonella, TB, every disease spread rampant. They're inevitable, right? reports percentage people catch covid end long covid? thing, year. Highest fever 104.3, husband watched took temperature every 30 minutes trying decide needed go emergency room (I it, know happening). Initially, ran high fever chills fun stuff first three days. following 5 days, fever bad persistent, ran fever every single day. 6th day total, took temperature saw 102, started cry. cry stuff like usually, tired it. Day 9 first day without running fever. ecstatic.

It completely wiped certainly actual illness, return normal self least another two weeks stopped running fever. tired easily, easily fatigued, awful.

My location Washington DC suburbs, FYI. telling treat corona virus weaponized smallpox way? 

Like seriously? Le gasp! Eh kind of. 22 year old can‚Äôt half shit want to/should friends age 22 Ok   funeral John Lewis. social distancing, packed church, masks. fact thwy following guidelines forced businesses shut bothers me. They're bad acting law. orders limiting gathering size, banning funerals, closing churches, though. shouldn‚Äôt really now, unless absolutely leave, even covering face mask keeping distance.

But see tyranny, 20,000 students along ithaca residents crammed tiny area, might city it‚Äôs densely populated way ok McConnell doing. Copying house terrible idea though. Also, one people whose lives careers completely stopped pandemic, bill completely reasonable support workers, local, state governments. even adjustments built based well pandemic going. 

Not voting sign rejected. think one government representative power, unfortunately that's are. gate keeper rejecting it. Pelosi pulling thing house. hell going on? expect get vaccines? early 2022? Lol probably going find large costume Izuku Midoriya throw candy people walking Halloween 2020. I've saying similar while. basically need back normal close normal summer latest mental health economic perspective. Yeah couldn‚Äôt win Vietnam years you‚Äôre gonna defeat Canada day‚Ä¶ lmao. possible wear mask sex, unless sex oral.

Young adults find way. There's decent chance might flu. tested positive flu middle July years ago. awful. Agreed, almost universally tighter fit cloth masks 100% agree. know even works unless throw someone room infected days see happens?

This joke also really study (non lethal) viruses immunity.

Asking friend. Fucking autocorrect haha despite vaccine tens thousands still die US.

We dont shut socoety though relief hear I'm one thought this.

I think people IRL okay continuing wear masks also realize cant go like forever. really reddit/social media people shaming others wanting normal life back. Oh boy...so matter we're screwed? Lol. Sad little doomsayers. Unless course, also require point explained. get sense 'ere scrap can't anywhere else, no? Reversed argument? sure mean that.

You mean I'm calling calling someone disliking masks still wearing them? hypocritical, comment would hypocritical, moot point. 

Either way, never said trying achieve complaining people right thing. trying achieve? Sweden rising cases right too. Maybe don‚Äôt like still it‚Äôs duty protect others? **coming Sweden fall**
A deaths might mean much Sweden considering they've many already, rest assured, Denmark worries elderly goes great lengths protect (unlike others). Donuts fell covid. ""Too High""

A little effort put masking, distancing, public education prevention, could bring 1. Agreed, lot people wont accept scream we're letting innocent people die. maybe go top 20 school, means usually smarter type go college get laid? Like schools 70+ percent admit rate. probably repost original title doesn‚Äôt get removed lmfao youre mad bro hilarious literally life hope enjoyed typing long ass essay read loooooool honestly pathetic Never actually said scientists indeed players, look posts. media message case missed point. Hahaha. high quality. sub. love it! different administration want chime give big virtual high-five reducing risk way. That's lot consumption, downstream health effects removed. hope stick post pandemic. Hehe. Yeah, SOMEBODY stupendous supply. muh freedoms already wearing masks it‚Äôs tragic, what‚Äôs point comparison? data proving work? I‚Äôd start Eventually burn within next year so, one way another. strong feeling vulnerable vaccinated hospitalizations plummet, things snap back pre COVID pretty quickly, whether it‚Äôs still mass circulation not. think it‚Äôs pretty reasonable say able resume fun summer activities next year. People willing sacrifice another summer social distancing. headlines love using term ‚Äúwave‚Äù may get flu days , getting flu shot helps stop spreading problem vulnerable immune compromised people. It‚Äôs perfect makes difference

Stories people getting flu flu shot almost always sheer coincidence wonder that‚Äôs possible. locals weren‚Äôt consulted opening school they?  extent though? point anti-mask cousin state Georgia many daily cases Canada. disagree. judges point stands. Either 0 people answer case everything closed locked down, specific guidance consistent (occupancy percentage maximum ‚Äúlarge gathering‚Äù number threshold). 

The legal system precise accurate. words chosen deliberate intentional. people can‚Äôt make shit up. It‚Äôs protect people‚Äôs freedom. words specific meaning.

Maybe judge political bias. knows. logic argument sound. lot articles topic...feel free go read more. makes sense. ""He clarified applies KN95 masks manufactured China. KN95s imported South Korea."" 

What even mean? KN95 Chinese standard ""N95"". understand KN95 standard meet American regulation. understand South Korea manufacture that. cheaper. compare South Korea N95 KN95? good news. Thanks sharing. completely different. infectious diseases kill lot people. difference numbers. 

if say cant go hang friends essential activity ill risk catching covid giving 80 year old die, logic also apply flu. Everytime hang friends risk catching flu spreading 80 year old die. sure risk lower flu covid, 0. happened 30k times 2018-2019

Please explain im wrong here. Hmmm, don‚Äôt trust anything China says COVID works too. like double mask keep clean possible easy get large quantities KN95 reuse them. Shut Slowest computer says ‚ÄúDuh!‚Äù Read reply fuckface. Actually proven useless pandemic.

I‚Äôm beginning think China welfare mind days.  I'll comment since live here: lockdown people respected March 20 May 20 aproximately. people started going often. Two months enough. problem? useless politicians. hundreds sites linked sub. Remembering wrote something intentionally difficult new world endless links.

You obviously never taken college STEM class. far truth. bug. That's green tab, click red tab flips red content goes green tab. agree. live risk associated flu. get Covid-19 similar levels,  Bad faith misread.

Those died died nothing lasting immunity. Nope! don‚Äôt understand crazy stories people got tests. It‚Äôs exactly flu test lasts little bit longer. got English built ones shear luck ( lack better wording ) California fires years back. 20 pack. Reminds great book called Poorly Made China. would rely China critical medical gear. I've using homecare patients even though surgical mask would plenty. They're elderly hear speak better I'm eating mask. Lol think American public go along that. 56 many survive? yay state! Tbh Bay Area probably dragging rest 3% line interior CA Socal poorly. Hopefully guv reopen state quickly time around. Yea that‚Äôs meant. Haha sure buddy. Let‚Äôs check see couple months. better idea. plenty ‚Äòexperts‚Äô don‚Äôt think anywhere close ‚Äòherd immunity‚Äô. one happens support newspapers point view that‚Äôs wrote article. go get test? It‚Äôs enough days that‚Äôs best answer. don‚Äôt think institute mask requirement every flu season, I‚Äôm responding point it‚Äôs small sacrifice save lives.

Lives would saved every flu season, doesn‚Äôt mean done.  Still 5 million canadians here. reason arent hearing reddit hivemind canada good, US bad

P.S. disagreeing reddit hivemind acknowledging it. Guy work told old people thier deathbed months live anyways.  whether Biden Trump, think year fucked year right now. even 2016, 2001, 2000, etc. there's couple months go. memorable, problem finding source.

Do normally get science headlines news articles science? remember rule learned science published microbiologist.

You believe want true whatever evidence supports good evidence.

That ain't science. Here‚Äôs problem number, means nothing.

Is excess deaths due COVID-19 infections?

Is excess deaths caused mitigation efforts? 

If 250,000 v 200,000 number completely COVID-19 deaths would put US underestimate 25%. 

The average underestimate [40% excess deaths. thought Canadians perfect wore masks social distanced? still getting worse? favorite customer comes ""looking"" comments oh dont know anyone wears day, comment back "" yeah thats work try go little possible"" know even read report like responder say why???

I guess let us know are. I'll tell professor research hit road pal, lol.

I know Canadians like annoyingly obsessed much better are- ever went war would lose. Point blank period. Unless youre allies China think we're worried lmao. think we‚Äôre already there. look state politics, civil unrest, health care, etc. done fucked up. It‚Äôs going take special leader pull things back together again.

Probably need legalize hard drugs prostitution revive it. time, up-playing masks? NEJM, Lancet, BMJ, JAMA... right, ok draw conclusions based data have, change conclusion new data becomes available. Get owned, fool. feeling going wearing masks years. Well, least us babies it. No. studies give insight. Italy, whole country locked spring, virus really make south, observed mortality rate 5-10% normal.

There Moroccan study reported reduced deaths linked reduce air pollution traffic.

Overall, therefore think COVID deaths rate slightly higher observed ""excess deaths"", needs study. beautiful!

Very frustrated. now, PPE made available. still designated hospital staff. anyone give good news? Thanks Could cause weather getting colder there?  thought masks alone would stop virus, bridge sell you. 

They probably help. way many people seem think everyone them, virus would gone. even saw headline masks better vaccines..! 

Unfortunately, simple solutions don‚Äôt exists making masks silver bullets mistake. even get one point? N95 masks respirator p100 filters. aliens 

++ Aliens !  Simply spoken, ADE thing, vaccination could (I emphasize could!) lead severe infection, depending kind ABs body generated ones neutralizing ones could produce ADE effect. seen studies yet suggesting that, right probable ABs first infections waned body delivered considerable humoral immune system response. - why?

There one report lately implied SARS-CoV-2 somehow might able cause ""B-cell amnesia"" cases, thus B-cells able memorize virus thus body, without antibodies, prone reinfection. choose, I'd go variant, vaccines would least deliver temporary protection (maybe yearly shot might enough).  daughter knot cord noticed immediately

This must mean say ""he risen"" Obviously start incredibly effective, great covid it‚Äôs dragged on, naturally that‚Äôs profound impacts many long haul. Thus point: bet aggressive got bit rest country (and many parts world) didn‚Äôt follow.

Not suggesting picked wrong path, hindsight cheating obviously they‚Äôre trying find different balance new opening rules. many lawsuits Sweden never warned may advice people wear facemasks. said might place additional restrictions Stockholm see surge new cases. would comment restrictions might ready. uptick cases multiple protests riots people stores God willing. even remotely close done [Sweden Could Introduce Restrictions Stockholm predict he'll delete account next. Thank answer. everything virus, ""we know yet"". God willing end soon. delayed care cause covid. I'm sure see Grammar* vaccines trigger immune response achieve herd immunity that, natural immunity longer viable? I‚Äôm trying advocate natural herd immunity anything like that, I‚Äôm confused people previously don‚Äôt immune response. enough people die, disappear. Trump right all. Sounds like idea moving goal posts bit complicated understand Holy Crap. Central Valley gets shitted good job Kern County. Yeah big claim, I've following China's daily number long time I'm certain 10 confirmed cases 3 weeks ago. either bullshit, case quite brazen exposed, else big discovery. necessarily. honestly know yet assume article ADE. early say that, thought likely course always possible.  excess deaths even worse consider we‚Äôve likely experienced far fewer automobile related fatalities year due many people working home. think often. I'm sorry. ever give answer happened? ultimate nightmare scenario I'm sorry live it. one best descriptions I've ever heard antibodies - immunity. everyone virus develops antibodies almost everyone becomes immune. also T-cell immunity.

Sweden doesnt think beaten virus, get absurd idea. Everyday message citizens must keep vigalent over. Currently dozens dozens reinfections confirmed show several cases severe reinfection. 

Many reinfections even confirmed, probably severe. 

Its possible, make norm. people stop wearing soon they've recovered. small town got first handful covid cases two weeks ago. Last week walmart took aisle floor markers main door baracades. like soon people saw mild cases, life started shift back normal. Masks still required even removed mask sign main door. side wall one looks at.

On yesterdays pressconference, warned might implement restrictions Stockholm see surge new cases. Afterwards reporters asked could tell anything restrictions might be. Tegnell answered: **No, recommendations ready.**

Just another foreign media making things clicks/their agenda gets hailed /r/coronavirus...

Reminds back spring rumours entire Stockholm would go quarantine. FHM went explain going happen reasons; think legal capabilities so, police resources enforce it, effects would small already community spread Sweden... yet, rumour resurfaced twice newspapers, urging Stockholmers get fuck still could. increase cases people touching multiple public surfaces, touching face/mask?  personally don‚Äôt touch face wearing mask, pretty much mask isn‚Äôt sink around wash hands first. been. reinfection cases severe disease happen change larger scope things. Immune systems perfect.

But one reads article, link. take article four specific cases India god declaring infection deadly last megaphone. 

Its pretty ridiculous, sub general. consider pretty cautious person comes pandemic, well aware dangers. lot people sub takes fear mongering extreme. virus really gives us scope effect media people. get basically two cartoonish extremes side parroting ""facts"" got article headlines. That‚Äôs true. 70% effective vaccine given even relatively small portion population cuts transmission significantly I'm wondering fewer screenings. friend friend also stillbirth. older IVF baby told levels would monitored xx often. covid hit told fine better come tests. Well fine wasn't. can't imagine. guess could true. SF, someone CA said Valley, immediately think Central Valley. 

However, considering said conservative, Central Valley super conservative compared parts SoCal. Ok, ""work"" mean light revelation? realize data still coming in, mean antibodies causes worse disease upon reinfection? Holy shit, good. It‚Äôs like whole novel Dude still posting shorting market abuse cause know option. Stockholm syndrome type thing. he's legal state allows it, easy cheap grow scale supply personal needs. There's lots help available r/MicroGrowery

If state allow that, try asking various dispensaries know programs help financially limited patients. example, one local dispensaries program sell ounce week $1 patients serious conditions (Which grow selling $1 lbs to, Covid stops bringing facility renovation halt)

If he's illegal state (or country) though, real option advise move. :/ Yes? problem comments made that, correlation people dying particular disease low compared something else, maybe disregard precautions go back old normality, acceptable everything power stop affecting many people possible.

Even number people dying zero still continue fight harder. can't wear mask without going panic attack feels suffocating much internet only?  Welldone ""Civic duty"" vs ""personal liberties"", America, selfishness always wins Big true best believe it.

2. Mid-range (2-4 months): Dangerous period. Neutralizing antibodies worn still 'other' antibodies could cause ADE. 
3. Longterm (4+ months): detectible antibodies all, TCells kick make disease milder. Yep, people start coming back cases start rising, then? fundamentally understand viruses work. even one person it, nothing. give two people, two become four forth.

The board meeting township board trustees ""Halloween"" agenda, local social media filled people saying matter, lights candy regardless township says. Croatia rare European country bring daily new Covid-19 cases zero back May. become example summer tourism triggered second wave infections sweeping much continent.

The fall poster boy hot spot came government, motivated economic concerns, decided open coastal nation‚Äôs borders early summer woo foreign tourists pillar economy. becoming infected, tourists returned home, taking virus them.

Croatia become case study international travel acting accelerant pandemic. Like Croatia, travel within traditional tourist destinations pushed number infections across Europe, according health-care officials. France, domestic vacationers linked surge cases country‚Äôs south along Atlantic coast. Spain experiencing record new infections concentrated Madrid tourism hot spots large influx domestic foreign visitors.

While experts say resurgence Covid-19 driven tourism-related travel vacation hot spots, example Croatia‚Äîa small Balkan nation appears outsize role spread virus‚Äîshows European summer season unraveled continent‚Äôs earlier gains battle pandemic.

After lifting lockdowns, Croatian local authorities allowed clubs bars reopen popular destinations along Adriatic Sea coast, attracting visitors ranging German students budget Jay-Z Beyonc√©, spent time month.

With Mediterranean climate, 500 miles Adriatic coast, picturesque ancient towns affordable accommodations, Croatia all-year magnet tourists Western Eastern Europe alike. country hosted 21 million visitors 2019, according Croatian Tourist Board.

Maria Tejero, 34, said traveled along Croatian coast August, passing island Hvar towns Split Dubrovnik. described crowded parties bustling bars restaurants hardly anyone kept distance wore mask, recommended.

‚ÄúPeople would kindly tell us didn‚Äôt need comply [masking] rules bars shops,‚Äù said Ms. Tejero, lives Italian city Parma.

European governments, meanwhile, eager recoup mounting economic political costs spring‚Äôs lockdowns, opened European Union‚Äôs internal borders June, triggering rush region‚Äôs sunbelt.

The result, according health-care authorities several countries: rise infections among mainly younger travelers that, return, began eating way home countries‚Äîthe biggest setback Europe‚Äôs fight virus since region‚Äôs first wave peaked March April.

Now fighting coronavirus surge home, Croatia‚Äôs leaders said decision fully open country ahead tourism season calculated risk necessary prevent economic meltdown.

‚ÄúPeople make living,‚Äù President Zoran Milanovic said recent broadcast interview. ‚ÄúMaybe bad end‚Äù added, pointing low mortality rates far.

By end July, Croatia hosted 2.5 million visitors, 40% 50% last year. comparison, Spain lost 75% visitors, Portugal 83% Turkey 86%, according official figures.

Croatia‚Äôs location Central Europe big advantage amid much reduced air traffic, making easy reach road large number countries. peak season August, cars buses wait 10 hours cross border country.

Germany, Austria Czech Republic say rebound infections since mid-July driven part people returning visits Croatia.

Between Aug. 10 Sept. 6, travelers returning Croatia accounted 12% new Covid-19 cases Germany, according Robert Koch Institut, Germany‚Äôs leading epidemiology institute. country also topped list destinations German residents infected period.

The Czech Republic experiencing record number infections, officials say fueled nearly 100,000 tourists returning Croatia August. Austria, third new cases came returning vacationers earlier month, thousand Croatia.

In Croatia itself, number new daily cases grew early March peak 96 369 recorded Sept. 3, country‚Äôs daily record far, according Johns Hopkins University. country recorded total 14,279 infections far total population four million.

The situation notable similarity event helped spark first Europe‚Äôs first coronavirus wave last winter, thousands visitors around Europe contracted virus Ischgl, Austrian ski resort, bringing back home, according health-care experts.

Like Ischgl, infections occurred among tourists Croatia believed taken place clubs, bars parties, according Dr. Krunoslav Capak, head Croatia‚Äôs coronavirus task force.

‚ÄúWe tourists arrived infected, vast majority got infected here,‚Äù Dr. Capak said.

Authorities issued guidelines bars, restaurants entertainment venues social distancing masking, Dr. Capak said, weren‚Äôt mandatory. consequence, venues operated without restrictions.

Mirjam Hagmann, 26-year-old recently graduated Malmo University Sweden, said hardly anyone wore mask stay island Krk July.

‚ÄúThis understandable: hot one wanted actually put mask on,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúEverything like pandemic.‚Äù

This stark departure winter spring, Croatia managed fend virus thanks well-prepared health-care system, decisive epidemiological response high public vigilance, said Ivan Dikic, biochemistry professor Frankfurt‚Äôs Goethe University Croatia.

‚ÄúBut vigilance dropped initial success, people seemed eager go out, travel enjoy summer severe lockdowns,‚Äù Prof. Dikic said. ‚ÄúStill, incomprehensible clubs allowed open.‚Äù

Antje Rothemund, German woman lives France regularly visits Croatia yachting tours, said feeling freedom vacationed August liberating compared strict rules home city Strasbourg.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know whether naivet√©, calculated attempt attract tourists bit both, masks, distancing, tables crowded restaurants cafes set apart,‚Äù said Ms. Rothemund, 57. ‚ÄúIt basically like year.‚Äù

The position Swedish health agency changed. clarified question face mask recommendations plethora different scenarios never ""left table"" constantly re-evaluated situation importantly, evidence, changes. public health agency obviously recommend something firm science back up, accountability responsibility recommendation proclaims, would negative side effects.

The Swedish state epidemiologist Tegnell made point said constantly looking settings circumstances masks employed effectively. Mass media, article particular, analyzed public health agency warning may (soon) advice general public wear masks, absolutely, least specifically, hasn't.

But start clear message Prime minster, Swedish public health agency Swedish civil contingency agency situation may change, government public agencies act take necessary actions protect citizenry, regardless measures might be.

Mass media large public likes focus masks masks pandemic much less scary there's quick simple, universal solution. worry immensely complex problem global pandemic actually is.

 Seems like good model control virus worked. Australia extremely close completely eliminating virus (under 5 cases per day whole country lowest point).

Then slip Victoria, escaped hotel quarantine used returned overseas travellers. Victorian cases spiked 700/day one point.

So last month two situation basically that, eight Australian states, 5 completely eliminated virus, 2 low levels, Victoria significant rates infection.

Imagine living country rich nurse's office school China country race. called 'Han virus' would racially offensive. /s sarcasm, ay? yea, throw innocent workers jail choice go in. 
honestly, comment.... think there's lot coming play hope Wednesday breaks heart hear school lunches meals available kids. It‚Äôs hard understand people children cannot afford them. kids shouldn‚Äôt limited certain economic class would responsible consider resources available appropriately care kids. Kids expensive, need healthcare, food, school supplies, shelter, clothing, etc. even get FFRCA benefits would appear workplace even though plenty small enough subject law. couple interesting areas significant Hasidic populations, 40 percent people tested found antibodies, fueling speculation herd immunity might far off.

So, neighborhoods pretty hard hit, seeing uptick cases. may suggest 40% antibody rates sufficient flatten transmission without interventions, like masks, prohibiting large gatherings, etc.

The thing note that, again, neighborhoods hard hit, 700 deaths. Every family surely knows someone died. yet still virus denialism resistance public health measures. feel usual statement ""people take seriously they're affected"" strong assumption. may still take seriously, religion, ideology, etc.

Edit: one thing saw Twitter commentary. sharp enough spike put NYC's in-person school plans hold. City close schools local positivity rate goes 3%. We're bouncing little 1% right now. course, Hasidim schools, may care much effects public schools. Wow makes feel better, chances still quite low. I‚Äôm point pregnancy are, I‚Äôm numbers person, looked bunch months ago. 

Sadly, normal risk factors stillbirth magnified still apply‚Äîrace class access prenatal care still biggies (and really one risk factor, think it). 

The one coronavirus factor seem people coming avoid exposure virus. increased risk complications wide variety conditions‚Äîpregnancy one affected. point being, feel anything wrong, call doctor go in! risk corona there, hospitals clinics mostly taking lot precautions they‚Äôd rather see make sure everything‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs embarrassing people actually think 30% people infected lifelong consequences. Tens millions people globally infected, don‚Äôt think there‚Äôd far evidence health care systems? Articles look severely ill tell us absolutely nothing recovery vast majority. It‚Äôs little better conspiracy theories sub point. give fuck are, allowed innocent animals tortured murdered laugh it, right fuckin head. care politics are. fucked human trash.

Stop trying justify evil, pathetic fuck. people actively lying local health department. live here, county. It‚Äôs joke Whenever BNO article gets shared sub, always feels like something terribly wrong happen Well course, people get sick injure Wednesday silly... parents can‚Äôt stay home children 24/7. blame shit government.  would pull kid daycare immediately. Fuck that. Political pressure. Hey, Sport, wanna help clean cesspool?! disservice people Sweden let novel virus run country uncontrollably.

As swede seen that. confirm. live county people rabidly entire reality virus. point don‚Äôt even want teachers students wearing masks attend school 5 days week face face 25 kids packed room 1 teacher. 

We‚Äôve open enrolled another school. Yes, really is. love doom porn like rando journalists pump shit. patently absurd say 30% covid infections severe lifelong consequences. People sub terrified living fantasy land. Trumper lies again. expecting? That's do. sick days ever got child school sent home either puked fever melting desk. I'd get trouble weak missing class. 

I feel kids man. parents downright lunatics. sub never admit man they‚Äôre far that's downplay it. Trying pin China got bad here. virus attacks defenses ? Yeah, keep border closed long possible keep people safe dangerous Canadians. could asked foreigners country stay. Instead, gave free visa extension everyone they're kicking everyone out. dont agree either side vote party. Fuck corrupt useless system even work?! district said same. doesn‚Äôt make sense me. check fevers give child meds? Higher threshold go doctor absolutely right. baby April around time saw alarming amount mommas several baby groups talking suddenly changing birth plans home births. Whether you‚Äôre home births, take ton planning, suddenly start planning last trimester seemed wild me.

My doctor advised induce days early, did. due around time estimated cases would sudden triple area. did. like *wanted* look. even attractive person. grossed scared, fearing life. Panic overtook me, anything *I* victim. places may even qualify sexual assault kind. People like reason old people dying keep getting lockdowns. one way curve spread thats relentlessly attack shame people thinking following arbitrary inconsistent rules make go. see this? son's school want send kids unless fever vomiting. changed expected Covid. school us tell feel way in. temperature check, nothing. Everyone‚Äôs gonna lie mucus filled throats. may go past bit.

This week, next week Panama. Clearly what? I‚Äôm confused you‚Äôre referring to. Like said, insurance expert pointing different maybe look Medicaid pregnant. don‚Äôt know history insurance plan pretending to-was suggestion (: Obamacare affordable care act mess I‚Äôm sorry deal that. Hopefully there‚Äôs new better reform soon cheaper ob appointments especially you‚Äôre pregnant! Cleanliness isn‚Äôt mask works. Instead uses electric fields pull microscopic particles onto fibers. wore mask length time, it‚Äôs outlived use loses electric field.

How N95 masks I'm currently pregnant. single appointment 12 weeks (end first trimester). first pregnancy, already 3 appointments 2 ultrasounds point. way less appointments half virtual involve actually observing baby all. pandemic something strange: said pandemic would doubted, downvoted get angry retorts, especially added low education, low education *sexuality*, poverty, systemic racism, etc.


Now open. whole state flooding? tests aren‚Äôt free, even abundant. Even state makes tests free residents, someone paying it. Two PCR tests would add $200-$400 per person cost trip. Hawaii pays they‚Äôre reducing gain tourism. tourist pay it, disincentivizes going first place. health insurance pays it, next year everyone‚Äôs premium goes like 30%, feds force give free tests subsidize cost, everyone America pays future form tax increases. Nothing free. 16 open.

If convinced post fact explanation probably believe Sweden performed better Finland &amp; Norway. concern protect well, exchange valve protecting others. young people I‚Äôve seen hospitals ICU morbidly obese /r/nottheonion Thank sharing topic, mural Peel Street meets Staunton Street Hong Kong. Daily stats noisy. Look 7d averages. said works see average 6 days. faeroe islands count? yet 100% recovery rate I'm arguing that. think Sweden irresponsible compares unfavorably Nordic neighbors, talking error OP made asked about.

thinking Tegnell talking country sweden talking Stockholm bigger error couple weeks. Difficult blame political pressure excerted speed development process vaccine. Exactly, thats can't follow deniers logic. Even list. 150 entries. It‚Äôs 11th. It‚Äôs top 10% worst. don‚Äôt think qualifies success anyone‚Äôs books. Exactly. sweden none us think going anytime soon.

FHM clear swedens plan lighter restrictions, place really long time acceptable. death, birth. Lol sorta oracle ad Patty Hadju, doesn‚Äôt think much... wonder, 1.5 meter regulation even show notably positive effects? Moreover, still allowed go school I'm allowed six visitors home? almost sounds like 1.5 meter rule solve problems. main problem people lazy forgetful wash hands wear face mask. even bigger problem fact many people one area. number people limited every existing location, regardless whether 1.5 meter rule place. give 2020 ideas. Sweden implement measures flatten curve, though. I'd argue Sweden one countries actually flatten curve. countries tried eliminate suppress virus instead.

To ""flatten curve"" simply means slow spread enough sharp peak overwhelm healthcare systems, buy enough time expand healthcare capacity.  friend works Jellystone would tell full pool daily, it‚Äôs decent sized wave pool filled fucker max capacity every day summer. terrible thing. this. Sickness president letting people die neglect still borns able see sick father mass death race riots... possibly do? world still think protests Memorial Day spread SARS-CoV-2? hard time believing since wearing masks, bandanas, pretty much like wearing mask according science I've read. Considering non N-95 masks protect much, takes 10-20% wearing masks bandanas infect mask wearing people.  
Most articles saying related 3 weeks Floyd's killing, maybe month, mainly big surge(happened right articles). many follow-ups since, looking COVID graphs, sure looks like that's surged 2-3 relatively stable months.  
I wonder, seems like timing soon bad news Breonna Taylor going come right predicted beginning second wave within next month so. haven‚Äôt seen someone wearing mask grocery store since least March. Early April latest New York's suggested 1 percent.

New York .2 percent population die.

IFR .3 realistic accepted range.

Meanwhile new york 21.3 percent 33k deaths, ifr .8 percent.

That's quite swing.

These infection rates modeled, like recorded values result seroprevalence surveys.

so return numbers edge estimates, skeptical. sister says asian cultures tend little considerate others. words, nobody running around putting freedoms ahead others heath. 

She also says Singaporean folks super law abiding. live strict social rules tend behave way told to. 

She also says Singapore rich town (country) excellent modern health facilities, probably keeping people alive bit places

Talk Argentina Australia. That‚Äôs president messed still don‚Äôt coherent strategy across country. Obviously that‚Äôs worse country strategy Sweden still almost bad America isn‚Äôt following. like Germany Korea. can‚Äôt sure don‚Äôt give 0.25 reduction R 0.30 increase R people instead get sloppy masks, resulting net gain R. Perhaps likely - can‚Äôt *sure*. 

E.g people went shopping groceries 10pm without mask might start peak hours ‚Äúit feels safe anyway wear mask‚Äù, terrible idea. took bike work spring start taking bus ‚Äúnow people bus wear masks feels safer‚Äù. 

Whether case much probably varies populations too. countries, permanent residents humans. Japan, ""staying bit, but, go home filthy foreigner?"" ""In world without hope..."" 
According data released SP Government, 5.36% immunized perceived low-grade adverse effects, frequent mild pain application site (3.08%), fatigue (1.53 %) moderate fever (0.21%). It‚Äôs next man mentality. warm body stuffed uniform, handed rifle, pointed toward enemy, told fight. Doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôll good actually know they‚Äôre doing. 

At point self check outs outnumber ones staffed. point need even fewer working registers. Guess people aren‚Äôt essential anymore. Depending side effects 5.3% pretty significant statistic Not, I‚Äôd rather quick. Cancer needs excised. Explain Thailand, Cambodia, Laos then.

And No, genetically homogeneous. Coincidentally, seems using similar measures combat Covid, perhaps better explanation? seriously doubt anything like ever implemented states. unfortunate. Many us high risk can‚Äôt completely isolate. I‚Äôm fortunate enough I‚Äôve able mostly isolate, even still forced public go doctors office screenings many people still refuse wear masks, thus putting risk anyway people‚Äôs poor choices I‚Äôm right thing. Many high riskers cannot afford isolate either, delivery markups insane many cannot afford them. high riskers live areas isn‚Äôt even option. It‚Äôs simple said unless government going start giving high riskers handouts stipends isolate, taking care need support (food, meds, etc). tell: Amazon supposed pay taxes... *on losses*? realize works right? Carry-forward losses, etc. talking additional $600 week people getting ended July. that‚Äôs causing huge issue unemployed. us unemployed since March, told don‚Äôt qualify unemployment, don‚Äôt qualify PUA? $1200 supposed fucking last damn near 7 months? end go work place doesn‚Äôt require masks enforce social distancing money coming try catch $10,000 worth bills went unpaid since March. government people writing articles go fuck themselves. NEVER see story us never got unemployment. suck fat hairy cock.

You got two people household EXTREMELY susceptible catching this, either get it, definitely could mean death. fucking government don‚Äôt care, won‚Äôt help us all. us forced working try keep fucking roof heads keep car continue work germ infested places, risk getting COVID. I‚Äôm gonna totally honest. Neither party government fucking thing us. No, shouldn't. simply safe. experts saying wait awhile going completely normal even *with* vaccine, right even vaccine. got job working ‚Äúpart time‚Äù hours get full time benefits 32 hours week parents think I‚Äôm lazy something really I‚Äôm trying burn spend time daughter things like working out, relaxing, etc. vaccine mean end virus.  still COVID, still precautions taken, etc.

Maybe means end Met Opera similar organizations. understand obstacles involved organizations.  hope many possible re-invent entire organizations survive new world. waiting COVID disappear seem sustainable plan get this.  assuming everything back normal next year precautions needed, public behavior back pre-COVID times like nothing happened, etc, solid survival plan.

California imports shit load electricity. basically need buy something like 40% electricity consume. number skyrocketing recent years. read California's energy decisions past 40 years far comprehensive though, really want learn California expensive need dig much deeper energy decisions since 1980.

PG&amp;E problem, much smaller problem Californians realize. US government already ordered 100 million doses distributed free (they paid $10 per dose single dose vaccine). There's need comment every single vaccine post, governments going innoculate free. get it, Big Pharma bad. Yea definitely seems like common sense thing people probably shouldn‚Äôt, thought would obvious whilst there‚Äôs highly infectious disease üòÇ Yup system failed us big time. one time stimulus package joke. even sure trick treat not. leaning toward halloween party night social bubble. 

But trick treat would go houses lights wanted participate. would wear masks. would carry hand sanitizer. 

So exposure would incredibly minimal since outside entire time. 

They way way way danger school enclosed poorly ventilated rooms day every day don‚Äôt like (and don‚Äôt either) best thing stop voting people limit ability build houses live. way housing affordability crisis build way out. intentionally dishonest he's shitbag.

You mean like said doctors work socialized systems healthcare ""conscripted slavery""? case Oregon, Washington, New York would too, yet they're not, hmmm. expect??? Sigh!!! America America thanks electorate. vast majority people generally moderate leanings, broadly support populist measures (that go nowhere). ...also UIUC, USAFA, Purdue, testing everliving shit everyone enforcing stuff like locking buildings enter tested within week contact tracing on. No, brainwashed vote best interests. realize paid taxes last year Amazon right? That's already socialist country. corporate socialists.

The problem (which I'm condoning) parents work, bind choosing stay home children (potentially quarantine 2+ weeks) able work pay bills, sending kid school pay bills go broke. risk losing job entirely long.

The lack social safety nets blame. Trillions dollars dumped businesses trickle-down model know trickle-down economics work. unemployment benefits, needs job protection people stay home extended periods time care sick family members (there parts CARES act). working class also needs/needed 4 months extended unemployment insurance like pandemic magically got better 4 months--this going get really bad winter season even get ahold things summer/early fall I'm ashamed state country right now.

Considering plenty addicts figure injections veins, even likely difficult. - happens knowledge meets moronic ideology, every time incorrect. Stillbirth rates Hispanic people US like 0.5 higher whites per 100k. correct socioeconomic status that‚Äôs highly likely LOWER non Hispanic white population. group high rates would native Americans makes sense given shitty access quality medical care (there literally aren‚Äôt enough beds reservations rural access hurts care quality). Additionally rates alcoholism things affect more. 

[Really group dramatically higher stillbirth rate regardless wealth access black people. know it‚Äôs PC say this, social factors play role. Education actually going doctor trusting science aren‚Äôt important black community due things like Tuskegee experiment Henrietta Lacks. Historically unjust White science experiments hurt credibility population already shaky view authority. much black population country, live urban centers near best medical offices world qualify free hospital care rates higher populations, don‚Äôt make use access. also pay far fewer taxes. Never forget, upper middle class (and middle management) vanguard upper class Professional Managerial Class. Sick leave would need come W2 salaries, cover would huge.

I'm Canada reason could keep kindergartner home cough last week took career hit stay home parent kids young. husband ""essential worker"" 3 sick days year rotating shift work. People sort assume I'm home kids we're well really can't afford parent home. daycare costs sick days required kids get sick (which often), can't get job field (or entry level retail fast food) cover things and/or allow home care children hours daycares open we'd work. working similarly husband, we'd sick days quickly, we'd shit luck either kid sick can't attend school daycare. meantime, we're limping along financially, lots important things falling wayside. 3 days better none, sure... generally expect jobs, experience.

This pandemic exposed lot vulnerabilities linked health employment status become, individuals families, even countries previously considered socially progressive. There's huge proportion people choose health + social responsibility livelihood. Epidemiologists public health folks long favour things weaken relationship health outcomes employment status... seeing exactly is. No. America fucking far right. America problem. rest world least left leaning option. America, current radical right administration spews lies centrist democrats ""radical leftists"". people absolutely view anywhere outside US would eat shit up. Congrats propaganda sponge brain! I‚Äôm lucky work district nurses every school. There‚Äôs one district nurse necessary degrees &amp; credentials. every school site there‚Äôs LVN. don‚Äôt get paid well enough (and could probably make much elsewhere), guess hours &amp; work environment must make it. 

But districts cut nurses. It‚Äôs terrible, considering number kids serious conditions school like diabetes allergies, plus amount kids take heavy duty meds. add COVID mess... Sounds like reasonable routine. 

We Clorox wipe groceries, dish soap others. Fruit vegetables rinsed well less simply (low) risk. 

The idea surfaces primary means virus spreads hasn‚Äôt led us altering precautions. helped us stay calm mistakes happen. example, sometimes (rarely, happened) forget wipe steering wheel car grocery store. happens, hope hand sanitizer use get back car shopping enough. let go. 

 Calmer, forgiving. much different, principle. I'm Netherlands. People still dump sick kids school daycare want rearrange schedule deal it. thing maternity ward hospital. People using tylenol get past door screeners visit covid. hope die boot neck I'd point retired. That's heroes do.

Real public servants incredibly important deserve protection. could reason? bad side effects? VAT regressive tax, want that. Europe hard tax poor. would like think could get better COVID companies desk jobs done remotely. Allow easier take care kids even enough sick days spare.

But lets face fact US (I feel one worsts) working class balls keep cranking vice get profit them. yay capitalism ethics ... wrong Susan Collins video? visibly shaking voice quivering. kind medical disorder something? It‚Äôs true. People would look like they‚Äôre dying can‚Äôt call they‚Äôre sick time. issue lies dishonest employees. Washington State able take sick days without doctor note... fact, take 'mental health' day discussion employer. Basically, want day off? Take it. HUGE issue place employment.. place ONE employee decides they'd like three day weekend sunny Friday, take it.. leaves us follow true meaning 'sick' day left working extra cover dishonesty. 

I'm sure combat issue, issue. 

In perfect world employers need calculate 'sick pay' everyone 100% honest people would take sick day actually needed, employer would cover them. problem world filled dishonest people looking work system give fuck. truthfully... younger employees. 20-25 crowd abusing system here. read cities china high alert locked down. lie. sister elementary school principle.

I‚Äôve seen lots older adults sides ones don‚Äôt believe know live country towns lower education. daycare got much push back parents allowing sick kids, ‚Äútemporarily‚Äù revised policies allow kids fevers runny noses attend. Fucking bullshit. Sure whatever say. Thought guys don‚Äôt restrictions? suggestions. It‚Äôs confusing  Compared plenty places, yes Yes this, volume super annoying. might including internet cable package. It‚Äôs unnecessary. UK spread actual virus growing January, predicted start, means making new virus testing unnecessary.

I thought people lab created viruses?

People volunteer military paid job career. It‚Äôs comparable. Yeah, seems masks work ‚Äúin theory‚Äù, factor real life don‚Äôt work anymore. that's sentiment get behind, know less foreign doctors, local punters would shoe-in! Fake news dying american rag. How's pandemic going USA, way? ignorant bullshit can‚Äôt nice things. Man, got super lucky able snag power rack Amazon found 300 lb weight set facebook marketplace. Shit ridiculous right now. agree completely. people willing heroes. .

One thing consider trials still need placebo wing verify infectiousness challenge (that faulty challenge resulted infections) compare symptom severity two groups vaccine intended provide that. one half going without even expected protection might go knowing antibodies present.

#### Abstract

Since initial reports COVID-19 December 2019, world gripped disastrous acute respiratory disease caused SARS-CoV-2 virus. ever-increasing number reports neurological symptoms patients, severe (encephalitis), mild (hyposmia), suggesting potential neurotropism SARS-CoV-2. Perspective investigates hypothesis reliance self-reporting hyposmia resulted underestimation neurological symptoms COVID-19 patients. acute effect virus nervous system function vastly overshadowed respiratory effects, propose important monitor convalescent individuals potential long-term implications may include neurodegenerative sequelae viral-associated parkinsonism. possible identify premorbid harbingers Parkinson‚Äôs disease, propose long-term screening SARS-CoV-2 cases post-recovery expressions neurodegenerative disease. accurate understanding incidence neurological complications COVID-19 requires long-term monitoring sequelae remission strategized health policy ensure healthcare systems world prepared third wave virus form parkinsonism. One-third patients hospitalized experience long-term symptoms. bottle service though... yeah, still no. lot historical data flu deaths. state fairly normal flu year 110 confirmed deaths. Covid caused 2,100 it‚Äôs 20x impact flu. Again, flu number steady compared years. Even pandemic, people often seem get unreasonably angry others make mistakes due autopilot, even though it‚Äôs something sometimes. It‚Äôs probably due ‚Äòwe judge intentions others actions‚Äô thing. No, means 280k extra deaths, 210k officially counted COVID-19.  

The 70k like mostly COVID-19 deaths counted such. can, take generation better education. 

I also think it‚Äôs possible reset tone nation ‚ÄúUs‚Äù vs ‚Äúme‚Äù mentality. It‚Äôs easy, great leader could begin work. Totally understand question, thank trying soft :). hospital grew going to, catholic side things never really came mind (it's basically hospital pretty much everything else), wife's obgyn working temporarily. know going ""procedure"" hooked everything. said would talk doctor it, kept getting pushed off. Unfortunately, right mental state, that's absolutely would done. Mask wearing effective everyone wears one. keeps respiratory droplets ourselves, also wearing mask also decrease amount viral load inhale. viral load inhale sicker get. two people 20 known died disease far.

Who decide ‚Äúonly‚Äù deaths meaningless. 

We also know young people much less likely tested, that‚Äôs mentioned.  $145/month year still cover basic medical procedure without insurance. Let alone something like going ER acute chest pain difficulty breathing. once. 3 hours ER, EKG, chest x-ray, blood test, basically checking see heart attack. insurance good financial guy ER said checked twice better believe it. 

The bill? paid $1,100 amazing insurance. insurance company covered $10,000. insurance, $11,100 total would even more, hospitals charge insurance companies less individuals.

Oh, kicker? still pay $80 go see GP following Monday (this happened Friday night), ER determined dying whatever get worse 3 days, sent home told go family doctor find actually wrong. also required take time work, something many people even option do, costs even \*more\* lost wages. sure I‚Äôm getting downvoted. [I didn‚Äôt make know, see ""Asians subservient"" ""Asians comforming"" ""Asians willing sacrifice personal freedoms"" things quoted lot think dramatically oversimplifies things well kind racist implications.

Singapore, Japan, Taiwan South Korea compared West tend cultures low rates obesity, large pro science education systems, affordable health care.

Imagine replacing every obese anti-mask, wannabe rebel Karen thought lab techs getting paid $20 hour bribed fake coronavirus tests secularly educated, pro health care Korean look like melted potato. US would already control already point. cannot understand society structured way. 

Greed. think therapies currently developing going successful bridge sell you. Hopefully 1 are. That‚Äôs literal reason multiple independent therapies development lol. novel tool compound years away FIH dosing, regardless money. MedChem takes time, I‚Äôve worked this, accountant. Gluck w life scared wearing mask. bit concerned though look Spain France almost everybody wearing mask. Masks seem work. fact, looks like may even make worse. restaurant serve alcohol need table service.

A nice get-out-of-jail-free fast food places. Masks, social distancing track trace - apply? loss Justice Ginsburg gop senate, permanent way life US. Considering IQ normal distribution, mean, median mode (functionally) equivalent. I'm sure point is? really interesting. Europe studies regarding premature births lockdown March April found significant reduction extremely premature births 90% (this Denmark).

I seen studies regarding stillbirths. increase stillbirths, could course downside premature births statistic, since stillborn baby count prematurely born baby. would kind surprise though actually case. That's good, otherwise never may know efficacy vaccines, least short terms. It‚Äôs actually around 250k count excess deaths. way million...like rocket ship. reason, easier keep surface clean keep hands certain individuals clean.  Oh yeah, stupid thing build compared could spent on. focusing money actually getting spent rather reducing taxes uber wealthy. shit. work, don‚Äôt even access paid maternity don‚Äôt go back work 8 weeks, lose access healthcare pay pocket (technically job protected for
12 weeks). It‚Äôs good time. Usually one could still get insurance pre Obamacare. it‚Äôs *price*. won‚Äôt able get insurance death ACA insurance companies go back charging whatever want, putting price range pre existing conditions. 

Insurance companies still enough customers, won‚Äôt cover sick people. Oh get extremely ill insurance? Don‚Äôt worry, remember jack price renew. Everyone I've ever known tried moving Hawaii went broke returned 48.

Paradise cheap, forget cheap, even affordable. What's source claim males work? Also, getting cash table working? Checkit folks, resident idiot thought kids immune? Man red hat says so. another post, asked exactly question: 6% 200,000 deaths COVID-19 related, killed 190,000+ Americans unexprectedly died since beginning year.

I saw someone respond question ""the riots protests.""

my god, nutty people there. It‚Äôs weird! baby 6 weeks ago received normal care entire time, even care (3 extra ultrasounds). husband even pending covid test one point still come in. 

I wonder care restricted others not. I‚Äôm even IL restrictive lockdown need McDonald's either. even less. **A lot** mask dummies live Wisconsin. definitely feeling need gym loss covid support group. I‚Äôve struggled hard. [Good AT&amp;T broken up, reformed like creature Thing. regional government keeps cutting health funds, Madrid super fucked astronomically grades higher thousand protests could provoke. majority side effects (if any) due vaccines occur 2 months dose given. FDA acknowledging requiring least 2 months follow-up trial participants 2nd dose type approval. There's answer question article poses probably fails answer that? Obviously it‚Äôs deadly, it‚Äôs killed people. OOPS, Thanks this, known/googled it! Oklahoma. Put house Arkansas market moved soon passed. someone left center care pandering either. look number counted deaths

Why looking deaths virus long term effects? pretty unusual adult fever. likely flu. Also, *years*-long mask requirements pretty bad long is.  No, FDA CDC operate separately executive branch. give green light let's roll Lol trivializing mental healthcare soothe fragile ego like boss, reddit moment wholesome 100 keep never works. know keep trying everytime I'm like, explain concisely data, facts, science, logic, reason finally understand. Nope, work. 

Last week discussion someone Facebook posted 6% CDC data. tried explaining death certificates comorbidities work. anyone preexisting condition hypertension, obesity, heart disease, diabetes, etc (over half population) die COVID included 94%. also asked him, comorbidities listed 94% literally caused COVID like Acute Respiratory Failure? response was, ""I've work data management 30 years know read CDC chart need try explain me.""

At point ask him, ""Since data expert, explain excess mortality data goes beyond official COVID death count caused COVID?""

That's conversation ended callimg ""sheeple"" saying, ""Well brain come conclusions. respect fascist bigot."" Couldn‚Äôt said better. would never guessed many Americans don‚Äôt understand scientific process don‚Äôt believe science. Get cord locks put ear loops. way adjust pull tight face. colleges I‚Äôve seen least Midwest ending semester Thanksgiving. Basically don‚Äôt tens thousands kids leaving coming back. would mean Canada would accept Bruins. thanks. mind fucking business, nazi made laugh watched live. 

I like day. told 2019 would never believed it. *big* expense retrofit older HVAC systems mention logistical headache many firms/organizations want deal with

They walked back recommendations DOW dropped 900 points

It's $$$ thought too, I'm getting hopes up. would easy way trump get votes. saying would make vote him, I'm sure would convince someone could missing something nowhere actual ECRI study suggest title trying testing imported FFRs revealed 60-70% provide sub-95% filtration performance. 

The study say report Chinese FFR ""one prevalent"" imported masks"" feel article definitely tried mislead. Kids runny noses digging candy bowls. Increased interactions people aren‚Äôt going 100% perfect scale following guidelines. Pretty much way. Divide study participants two groups. One gets vaccine one gets placebo. Everyone goes normal lives. placebo group gets sick vaccinated group doesn‚Äôt vaccine effective. Asking real question Actually slowly stocked January February could stay home. Doubt away. None matters though. stay home irrelevant. here...it's wide spread. Thank you... go video screenshot news broadcast try get chart lol Americans don‚Äôt comprehend civic duty. could never compare civic unity first world countries have. Yeah go walmart 2/3 people arent wearing mask. feeling people like say one thing look like give shit convenient show true colors not. Lmao nobody concerned storage cloth masks, something people wore Halloween pandemic. shortage filtration masks. would like apology everyone countries called us Americans dumb, useless, idiotic, etc.... Well people like seeing people's faces meeting flirting normal human behavior goes it. Weird, know. Maybe really ugly, idk. Also, people wear scarf neck. wearing one mouth? starting make lot sense. people likely downplay deaths people preach respecting elders traditional values. Yet hear old leaders leading base deaths. glaring hypocrisy clear example lack empathy.

Meanwhile article seems gloss fact old people US sending young people die pointless wars decades. Considering that, surprising may empathy fatigue among young people. better day start diet today. december might morbid range.

Look TDEE 500 number. Use scale weigh food track cronometer. simple. HIV patients covid counted killed AIDS. israel 20 cases day politicians decided populists open everything immidiatly 4000 cases day shit, look way people treat fast food workers, retail workers, low wage workers. current system reward empathy isn‚Äôt valuable maintain empathy. Empathy like muscle, need regularly exercise order become stronger. March-June 2021 estimate. bad it‚Äôs States side :( really know aim here. Maybe due covid interacted people while, hope go nuts like try explain basic things person. 

It hurt therapy though. Good luck! know not, though. Thats legit dumbest shit right folks. Well u expect government cowtows paranoid Karen‚Äôs trailer park dumb fucks instead letting science dictate handle crisis üòê give candy. could‚Äôve gotten candy kid without dressing that‚Äôd dream It‚Äôs wearing mask. It‚Äôs masks force - social distancing. can‚Äôt masks without social distancing. sacrifice. somehow missed comment. Same. work 98% job home want ‚Äúsee‚Äù people around office now. Right. assume work public? lot people to. forced work...why would stay home free time afterwards? Knowing likely exposed work afterwards.

Individual action, hey? 
I job could easily done home, yet go work building dozens others. Many Saskatchewan government workers worked effectively home March August, government sent back would spend money downtown Regina businesses. Kids packed classrooms. US Surgeon General said [wearing mask could actually harm *zero* research time supporting statement, flew contrary everything know. 

And know what? forgive thinking ""oh, people sew masks"". occurred hospitals near me-- making cloth masks time Surgeon General made false statement. highest health positions US can't ideas like introduced faster little podunk hospital something horribly wrong team. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article 30 cents piece mic non surgical masks kinda passed test, blow match, somehow smell smoke.

Edit, ok get curious, tried N95 mask bought homedepot Covid, result, still smell it. comment mine replied metastudies.  It‚Äôs crazy time haha  Who‚Äôs lives would coaches saving wearing mask? God swear people turned masks religion case police, stridently anti mask, able recognize suspects easily.  way, politician listening experts? never happened U.S. never free COVID-19. 

It‚Äôs rooted populace fucking retarded. It‚Äôs stay. Even vaccine comes anti-Vaxxers continue spread virus around anyone who‚Äôs immune compromised unable vaccinate gets virus dies.  

At point you‚Äôre immunoconpromised U.S. you‚Äôre way danger first world country. I'm teacher, luckily we're still online. know I'm going get Covid point, kids come back. area teach EXTREMELY rural, I'm talking school mile building cow barns. People take seriously. Hell, teachers taking seriously.

You know school implemented year? perfect attendance policy. extra $1,400 bonus end year. load shit huh? They're incentivizing teachers go school sick, middle pandemic. hell thinking. voting even less likely stop it. Yes  Many experts, including Dr. Fauci Dr. Redfield, believe normal life return end 2021 - is, 1 year now. vaccine, vaccine developer pediatrician Dr. Offit's words, ""not magic gold dust."" emailed kid‚Äôs school last night taking testing today due abundance caution. coughing chugged hours-old smoothie vomited, she‚Äôs coughing couple days bothering me. Home 10 days now, regardless test results, unless positive flu test (or affirmative diagnosis). won‚Äôt accept second negative test, differential diagnosis. I‚Äôm task force helped develop policy. I‚Äôm also school nurse ‚Äúsister school‚Äù *won‚Äôt allow me* refer kids testing. doctor says goes‚Äîincluding notes say ‚Äúchild symptoms‚Äù. 

What mean say is‚Äîwe‚Äôre f‚Äôd. schools, however well-meaning, disincentiving testing. longer feel get tested unless strong suspicion virus since she‚Äôll penalized‚Äîwe know severe symptoms always virus presents. 

Also, feel like head spinning. Every single private school nyc policy, policies mean nothing they‚Äôre enforced implemented way makes sense. 

Keep kids home. Really. wish could made choice, I‚Äôm still not, really, really understand can‚Äôt. can‚Äîdo! things good.

private gathering max 10 people

need long-term strategy without switching back forth time actually say *Limiting social contacts done ‚Äúmodular approach,‚Äù meaning rules may change depending epidemiological situation.* 

Some things maybe good

WHO doesnt recommend limiting quarantine 7 days.

Testing day five symptom onset may smart, releasing people prematurely may test sensitivity 70%

Not banning travel red areas, strongly discouraging means cannot enforce state. bullshit everywhere. I‚Äôve seen people building gym masks one says anything. bet complained they‚Äôll say can‚Äôt really enforce it. 

I guarantee start smoking cigarette gym immediately enforce smoking rule. helps. virus tiny transported larger molecules can't get past mask. Like car carries person can't get past doorway. you‚Äôre teacher walk fuck out. We‚Äôve got back. Swedish, living Germany much opinion China one way other. no, I'm removing ""truth"" order protect China. However, opinion piece youtube considered high-quality source matter subject.

Sure, totally different means transmission, swift serious response made spicy headline like 2 weeks instead year-long ordeal. Yuuuge!!! Oh wow 3 weeks early?! need start hospital bag incase. dido classes. couples class via video $100... really.. hell. getting books,any good ones recommend? congratulations bundle joy!! Well they're refraining sex, they? 

Anyway, that's analogy kinda breaks apart, like safest wear condom *and* sex - becomes bit silly thought. 

Still, one ask prominent reason someone kids above. I'm willing bet get kids wearing condom sex, wearing condom sex. LOL need loicence listen music? actual fuck :D :D delusional willfully refusing look actual data experts already ran numbers? realize already hemorrhaging ton money healthcare inadequate MFA would actually cheaper federal govt individual tax payers, compared pay now? Venezuela!!!!! /s 

Too many Americans next level stupid. also hope future generations. comparing day-by-day numbers averages? Lockdown also caused excess deaths isn't. guys want fear porn would warranted were. one pulls it, pull back up, I'm fine (gross okay, them). they've spent minutes reading headlines! case, combat issue terminating employees find abusing regularly. terribly often we've lucky hires, people can't trusted self-regulate given autonomy work. cycle people look people instead wasting time people going look opportunity abuse trust put them.

Bay Area street cops pull 150-200k garbage bullshit overtime even questioned. almost allowing kids go school forcing teachers teach in-person active uncontrolled pandemic terrible idea.

Had anyone bothered ask listen school nurse maybe even parent kid compromised immune system, they'd known beforehand parents general regard whatsoever anyone comes sending kids school absolutely know child sick, contagious stay away others. best find replacement. never experienced got nursing. ""I'll get right boss."" roll go back sleep I'm dying. Exactly. research aimed gaining insight. question heck Spain didn't. hell higher deaths per capita US, close? understand Italy lifted lockdown much earlier much better (more calmly), Spain started growing July still realized they've got huge problem hands?

Their government publishing clearly bogus death data May help, guess. friends Spain tell me, population get it. super-high mask usage throw huge parties evenings without mask. Thank information, certainly answered question. Literally cloth covering face doesn‚Äôt surgical mask. know Europe doesn‚Äôt cowboys fucking bandanas? cotton? Every one I've ever heard living upstate NY nurse. That's really good question, one admittedly easy answer to. cultural factors, also historical ones (such redlining). cultural factors mean family strength, also health beliefs, roles, on. 

So yeah, sorry concrete answer :/ Absolutely this! neighbor's kids missed three weeks school due illness. checked teacher every single day stayed caught work. district still made parents attend classes sending kids school important. bullshit. Maybe nothing report...wouldn't suck? vaccine, policy masks be? immediately able drop masks continue wearing cases drop? schools around happens kid go home can't come back get negative covid test. Maybe skip year, NYC already dropped ball year 6200 dead nursing homes number infections far, far higher reported due testing limitations, although like put figure it.

In terms 50,000, scientific advisers stood said 50,000 people got caught last time underestimated time they're probably erring side caution. But, figures based upon reading data effect numbers infections doubling every 7 days scientists agree believe they're far numbers infections doubling every 8 days. much reliable indicator number hospital admissions given open clouding testing returns reporting issues, data suggests number hospitalisations doubling every 8 days. So, looks like 50,000 number mid-October, event nothing, far out.

There probably another reason government's scientific advisers keen stand give worst case scenario state: ""no Christmas"" - may get large minority absolutely consideration people around them, alone significantly slow spread.

On hand, really need superintendent making $300,000 year two secretaries making $60,000 work year-round?

I'm 100% school funding, let's make sure people need actually getting it. superintendent making six-figures teachers paying pencils notebooks pocket. NYC likely 1-2 million cases period like month. time, UK huge death rate too. Ignoring counted cases, UK deaths per capita basically equal US since start pandemic. everybody *shocked.* teachers, knew exactly would happen. mom send sibling school try hide child awaiting covid test results. got mad school found made take sibling home. parents DOCTORS. know better. people treat school glorified daycare dont care could put students staffs life risk. No, I'm saying able study yet. know much it. study looking infections point cause. seen covid-positive pregnancy studies period. No, make treatment free everyone. 

Source: audit health insurance claims. voluntarily decided pay treatment covid 100% covered charges, large employer funds insurance make services still subject deductible copays. Many do. balance picked feds. Paramedic here, used respond schools nurse ended calling EMS child sick parents show pick child stuck work. Thats really realized screwed things U.S. think would happen, does. understand that, trully wish so. I'm saying happens time start looking new doctor. 

Our first obgyn stopped seeing everyone all, second started remote appointments. searched high low doctor willing complete checkups. get 30 Annual days Ireland  half country doesn‚Äôt get those.

My guess would much half. Pretty soon /r/covid19 became
strict demanding sourcing, sub went pretty anti-sourcing. guess natural dynamic people like sourcing leave left believe asking sourcing discussing studies means scepticism conspiracy theories something , thus get weird tribal things. get silly times. Nothing protests back fucking hate this. It‚Äôs expensive get mortgage bc make way rent homes instead? never build credit? Fuck America shocking say, like anyone brain saw coming mile away. happens run society without social safety nets. Social safety nets anything type socialism venezuela destroyed country either. Usually school special needs child requires nurse. worked child could seizures moment, wouldn‚Äôt stop medicated performed registered nurse needed transferred hospital every time happened. child 9 time already permanent brain damage it. 

We school registered nurse district. Don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs changed since (been ten years). could predicted this??? /s think may depend region US looking at. think Florida Texas levels, example, definitely worse NY currently is. Many parents send kids school sick aren‚Äôt anti-covid, they‚Äôre minimum wage workers get little days off, taking one day could cost entire job. doesn‚Äôt make situation less dangerous, really deep issues play So, less cold send miserable school day sitting uncomfortable desk, ill pay attention, infecting classmates teachers; ask already overworked underpaid teacher also play role nurse parent?

Yeah, maybe great strategy small children, kids double digits fine, going way comfortable home. call 911 something goes wrong. Goodness mate. said ""they literally put signs let us know."" Unless that's metaphorical phrase, definitely politcial. agree you. article says nothing percentages even link review itself. would guess life long complications would come well 1%, especially people hospitalized. two outcomes. one causes immune reaction. sailene injection.(no symptoms) vs vaccine( possibility symptoms). 

I red blotch arm week first second injection well 102.5 fever 10 hours second injection. blotch fever indicative immune reaction.

This reasoning. know quantitative date prove it. observations. district, teachers check fevers. given thermometer ‚Äúsleeves‚Äù beginning year. allowed give counter meds. it‚Äôs prescription, secretary it. it‚Äôs en epipen inhaler, classroom bag goes students go. trained use them. nurse week since shared four schools. duties mostly include paperwork. would love know why? believe virus gives 30% people life long complications. it‚Äôs excuse already corrected for. People study stuff. would never work. Inner-city Detroit hates suburban people, suburban people scared inner-city Detroit. paper fine idea, practice, whoever floated idea would next election cycle (if earlier). Yea, get that. science know exactly one spread, ever changing recommendations. hard understand? nurse couldn‚Äôt give meds? That‚Äôs absurd. Find another job company want take care you. enough people tolerate bull shit, happen. speak first point, matter high spread is, admit challenge trails get answer efficiency much quicker random viral spread. delay could result thousands deaths per day could averted vaccine proved effective. 

The volunteers know risks; would consider heroes helping humans get rid sooner rather later. Landlords would rather empty unit makes $0 tenant makes $0 imagine didn‚Äôt union. think that‚Äôs likely? this‚Äôll like March? Mine way. can't afford everyone out, let sick people stay healthy again. Better cautious. Probably parents can't take time work US sick kid. virtual performances types can‚Äôt see that‚Äôs possible opera. Maybe lack imagination. that‚Äôs read post ass that‚Äôs showing.
I expressed surprise secretary could give meds rather nurse common sense says nurses ones medically trained. already knew this. they're taking vaccine development time 10-15 years, 1.5 - 2 years. already know exactly UK government doing. They're trying suppress virus Summer next year lockdown measures restrictions, time vaccine approved distributed.

Testing vaccines way risky raises ethical issues. Vox made really good video this! I'll link video - bet fucking anti masker assholes happen parents. Fucking plague rats man. trying say could infections? studies I‚Äôve read don‚Äôt bear out. make America look like worst place Earth. People like blame everyone's jobs, mom housewife usually stay home school sick. allowed 3 days year school would start threatening call CPS shit truancy. went school sick lot reason school policy so. point I‚Äôm wondering many people suffer die understand absolutely necessity. Humans stupid species. stubborn slow adapt catastrophe it‚Äôs wonder haven‚Äôt died yet. You‚Äôre right, years I‚Äôve parents even bring kids children‚Äôs birthday party sick fuck. isn‚Äôt anything new, dose Tylenol send school, daycare ect pre-covid. local woman IG videos taking little girl target passed sick cart...like wtf. people refuse stay home kids It‚Äôs unfortunate many parents, taking day care kids could cost job Many teachers year point-blank told need prepare lessons in-person learning, synchronous online instruction, asynchronous learning. literally three jobs combined already one way-overburdened job. top also manage social-distancing, etc.

We're going lose many teachers year. Republicans know too, part plan destroy public education rich kids go private religious school everyone else get K-5 go vocational training service rich. imperialism Scottish clan exile Canada done? I'm still waiting free marijuanas promised growing up. course are. They've made admit it, allowed work anything weeks help. everyone afford work long pay. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Round 2. hard get someone understand something consider job understand. Every policy maker needs take econ 101.

If incentive something, people it. Send kid school, parent goes work makes money. send them, stuck home dealing sick ass.

So, surprise surprise, people that. Stop blaming poor parents start blaming poor government. parent granted stipend recover wages would happily take day, hell they'll take few. Doesnt help many schools area arnt even open yet.. idea private = innovative antievidence meme 80s point. read article study week ago. based Covid-19 infections study that. test women that's studying. There's nothing inconsistent quote. anyone surprised debating what's effectively capable curbing transmission going change risky behaviors (but determined financially sound) americans guilty point pandemic. would like convince people start looking practical game theory lens, one assumes people continue make bad choices (because, lets make real assumptions). Since chaos plan, next best move (that successful)? Please note: implementing rules/mandates usa proven largely unsuccessful thus far curbing spread virus... contrary: kids taught condoms don‚Äôt work abstinence reliable contraceptive *more* likely unprotected sex. even make sense say, false positivity rate \~1-2%, depending test.

I get think make sense. Sure, false positives would happened. false positives would quarantined, contacts would quarantined, confirmed whether genuine case Wuhan locked down, virus already spread China, like already spread parts world.

The amount spread provinces negligible.

Have look statistics. Thousands deaths Hebei. Barely deaths rest country. locked early, cases provinces double single digits manageable. result thousands deaths Wuhan, barely anywhere see many people commenting social media safe go business ""really good wiping surfaces."" didn‚Äôt mention politics voting. comment regards mask wearing. I‚Äôm Canada- mask wearing isn‚Äôt politicized saying evidence support mask wearing isn‚Äôt declaring undying support political party.

I simply saying disagree opinions can‚Äôt deny science. remember science slow, lots stuff happening behind scenes. bet even know folks working project reading article. Well, think I'm placebo.

You know trial. That's point.  Maybe meant district nurse? regional nurse shared 5 districts? I'll try again, way virus spread different virus behaves. virus spread handful ways example airborne, droplet, contact, stopping spread breaking chain infection. way affects human bodies enters different game. almost like country provides labor guarantees sick days family care time creates economic incentives send sick kids school. ??? Haha what? think you‚Äôre confused, conspiracy here. actually live part-time Netherlands I‚Äôm half dutch. Im pro science, actually studied university.

I don‚Äôt know man, it‚Äôs bizarre there. Unfortunately pathetic basement dwellers like you

I probably spend time outdoors lol adaptation permanent social distancing lockdowns.

No one said be, think appreciate razor-thin profit margins entertainment companies large venues slaughtered pandemic economy. general acceptance shit happens people keep normal.

what even mean Seriously. conspiracy freaks need come correct get fucking heads examined. What's next, caterpillars cause cancer? moon spying us? Reaggaedon secret alien code building time machines? still don‚Äôt get done arguing hope kids stay safe. No, people pointing live shithole country parents can't afford take care children properly. seeing happening US right now, I‚Äôm pretty sure happened Venezuela country looted people charge. Dude, fact Venezuela based entire economy oil direct result socialism. Without socialism would private industry sector could chosen diversify economy. absence that, government described, exactly socially controlled economy bad idea.

I'm talking social programs safety net citizens like Sweden, I'm talking literally almost every industry country controlled government. results speak themselves. voting impact one way another? Oh, good. today thinking ""Gee, hope shit never fucking ends.""  They‚Äôre glorious leader told it‚Äôs hoax that‚Äôs need know Last week. got one box 100 August last week another box mother.

I checked wow, they're out. Things go fast online bc free shipping. Ask experts.

I think read testing level less 5% tested positive.

But that's point. point testing India low long numbers totally bogus. Yeah, that's point. America shitty country. Well, parent boy got sick times last school year pandemic bullshit started, schools overly aggressive truancy policies encouraged us send long ""wasn't bad"". 

Doesn't matter suppose, schools around closed virtual learning stuff. Well chose kid. That‚Äôs fault. Shit happens, welcome real world entitled mombies. work. month they'll give shit they're tired virus they'll think hit already it. flu vaccine due strain variance 50-60% effective.

You may remember talk need wear masks socially distance covid vaccine due similar efficacy likely. 

So socially distance lockdown flu? determined work one thing. able keep sick kid home school able pay rent buy food quite another.

Even people considered fairly well trapped jobs give leave short notice. work hospital pre-covid could get written taking many sick days..... means able go outside without mask

this already norm though, since know outside transmission rare. parties concerts

yeah, sounds like real shit show, especially compared USA... errr... Fuck amount overhead billing costs enforced single billing code book... So, ready done capitalism, join union eat rich yet?

We're staring broken whole system top bottom, nobody willing go left Biden. Without giving people enough paid sick leave going work.  deaths attributed plot current US president? People abuse put country way much debt Sure, always better. difference states slight, makes major difference life.

The US Government may wanted regime change, anything ""raiding"" oil fields. US last year imported ton oil Venezuela. Even 2017 Venezuela low output, US still bought like half it. problem Chavez put Venezuela's economic eggs oil exports, oil prices fluctuate down, simply can't tolerate even minor changes. Maduro exacerbated deflating currency oil prices started decline 2014.

US embargoes response political corruption, definitely hurt Venezuela. Venezuela everything else itself. one else blame. right propaganda. personally saw bosses hate home life, can't stand going home want work long possible. working home, see Covid many people can't stand home lives, relationships breaking stuck house together.

Unless literally cancer care plan 1,312 beautiful cats retire

that's good number cats Italy quite unique situation since one particular area got hit ridiculously hard, whereas deaths countries evenly spread out.

The outbreak Lombardy led shocking scenes TV social media people see quite scale places (except Wuhan), even countries many deaths overall, experience level horror Lombardy did. There's difference terms emotional impact seeing numbers chart seeing armed police patrolling streets, people getting medical treatment tents, army trucks picking bodies crematoria full (although details last part make less horrifying seems first glance).

I also suspect seeing happened Lombardy, lot people became slightly desensitised numbers well. first time see deaths several hundred day, really gives shock. while, less impact. effect Italians seeing something happen country one seen looked death statistics, whereas people places like France, Spain Britain seeing numbers they'd seen before. Yep. I‚Äôm high school student get test quarantine tennis partner doubles came practice covid. Texas..... pay significantly less overall (because many rich people pay basically nothing) tax difference middle class family income tax difference perhaps 10%.

Yes, 10% lot middle class family, right? Youre right TOTALLY trust chinese data points. like total deaths, example. incredibly outspoken measures taken, think far normalizing anything

words != action People aren‚Äôt going taking precautions much longer, articles coming social distancing 2022 causing people decide stop taking precautions, think this? Usually virus mutates, becomes weaker part self say. mean 5G covid coverup. Rearrance letters COVID get? Thats right: EMF Radiation. front faces whole time we've busy showing pets zoom notice. monke

??? still sick vacation time, given 10 emergency days needed like child care elder care stuff (needs approved management). 

If test positive paid leave. sure falls know get it. 

If sick vacation time, would work sick, pandemic, live pay check pay check like half fellow Americans. 

Health care tied employment bullshit. 

Not given paid sick leave bullshit. Well go jail then. /s 
*cries American * Instead shitting entire state already severe poverty problems, maybe consider factors create someone like Jim Justice first place. deserve much better. don‚Äôt social distance every flu season?

because vaccine totally ignoring issues deteriorating mental health, increasing poverty missed medical interventions due lockdowns? 

Acting cost lockdowns either supreme ignorance disingenuous argument. going pay parents rent? 

Sick policy lack testing leads people taking unpaid time deal sickness. run center home parents throwing absolute fits send kids home. understand desire avoid conflict fuck that. family job. 

I thought built trusting relationships families. rona struck half lied symptoms families. LPT kids always tell you. Again, give shit candy. food allergies half goes garbage anyway. kid braces even probably go trash since can't eat candy. 

Its getting exercise, get fresh air, spend time friends family, see neighbors, see decorations, wear costume. 

My kids literally outside home public almost day long since August. school full time ride bus school one sons dance school. always public. 

If anything trick treating safer things everyday least outside. need evaluation every employer issue. See numbers are, create legislation accordingly. far still appears reinfections big problem. Scientific American isn‚Äôt legit source news? agree OP crazy I‚Äôm sure goal really, might bot. reinfection proven phenomenon point. last weeks verified examples corners world. new news. Parents always done I‚Äôm sure anyone thought would different COVID. First day back person kindergartens Monday. One kid snotty nose running mouth keeps coughing. course it‚Äôs kid parents sent gater covering. Adults barely keep longer twenty minutes turns kindergartener keep even less time. It‚Äôs annoying also expected point. Hunan HC three weeks ago, confirmed cases time. might lying. might information wrong. standard policy shut whenever suspected cases, positive cases. shut long, can't say. could bullshitting too.  vaccine.... virus doesnt audibly beg life need jerk material get home long day snuffing black brown lives. Americans flee Canada civil war breaks out? America garbage ass country Considering Covid roughly 8,000 died per day 200,000 died already year covid 
That‚Äôs 10%. hardly blip. mistaken (or good basic math) agree 87% Canadians.   
   
That's super majority. Super duper, even. reputable source? city police least likely citizens wearing mask. Anecdotal sure, still worth considering. Perfect timing...  Maybe ADE. would bad... Imagine many worldwide would died didn‚Äôt medical know help people 1918 drugs ICU anything war . would likely 40 million dead Computer says „ÅÑ„ÅÑ„Åà. many countries took victory lap first half pandemic.  Go figure why?..... Compared
To what? US states objectively compared worldwide terrible? Lol Surprising. abroad resistance mask wearing US seems much bigger. 
Here Costa Rica polling, would say 90-95% wearing mask US India compared europe fair. I'm deadass going keep wearing one even nice worry makeup im running grocery store Obviously massive red flag. morons would think meaningless. headline would made news anywhere else world USA.

Mission accomplished......wait what?  CDC says mask type worst, infact also spreads airborne ‚Äúsuper AIDS.‚Äù Wall street says pfft.....that's rookie numbers. Still better homemade cloth masks, neck gaiters surgical masks people wear Funny narrative went ""stay home"" back spring summer ""staying indoors make worse"".

In case, absolutely *no* situation cost lockdown ever outweigh potential costs covid. NYC Northeast spin class?!? downgraded internet only, covid comcast changed 190$ (all channels plus internet) 230$.

It expensive begin extra 40+ bucks month additional services made get rid cable altogether. originally tried downgrading basic felt cost worth, went internet only.

And don‚Äôt actually miss all. that's get People right complain China's lack free press video prime example what's wrong Western media that's get news feel sorry you. Surface area 510.1 million km¬≤, wouldn‚Äôt surprise didn‚Äôt Chinese person living next door you. hearts? one obviously best. No, like US, never know exact number corona deaths. 

We know lots people reading Uighur camps, isn‚Äôt like China even cover up.

Just saying Corona spreading Shanghai Beijing like US, even CCP couldn‚Äôt cover up. china gets away everything. Everyone scared say anything regret reading sub bedtime üò≠ One glaring difference fairly consistent message across board. Federal, provincial, local leaders running script.

People.are starting get complacent unfortunately cases rise.

Most everyone know fine leaving US Canada border closed now. fear Trump pressure open US gets control. wishful thinking turned inaccurate. diseases know confer long-term immunity coronaviruses behave like that. likely immunity one also quite short, see waning antibodies reinfections. isnt china getting blame  5 8 Australian states zero cases months. is, it‚Äôs eliminated. borders closed remaining 3 states (with exception ACT due landlocked within NSW).

2 (QLD NSW) extremely low numbers (sometimes couple day, days zero).

It‚Äôs Victoria significant levels transmission. close getting low numbers themselves.

The virus isn‚Äôt magic. anyone avoids people 14 days, cannot spread die off. It‚Äôs matter making sure anyone gets actually isolate, ensuring anyone coming interstate overseas also isolates 14 days. shit post Mr. Bot originally never told to, knee jerk reaction ‚ÄúMust wear mask ‚ÄòRona‚Äù 5 months later We're projected 378,000 deaths January 1st. pandemic over, please wear mask maintain space.

I find double standard whoever pessimistic, they're ""realistic"".

Well, never heard someone optimistic realistic? works too! fair- they‚Äôre probably sending kid school go work. School babysitter many.  Texas added 22,000 cases September 21st according [John shows ~10k ~18k new cases last two days. That's significant increase. looks like could backlog cases? Surprised one reported anything it. high school work two middle school one elementary (5 elementary schools district) Nothing said even addresses point let alone refutes it. would alternative DQ debate. 

You‚Äôre arguing numbers saying percentages manipulated statistics. .5% people know dying still WAY WAY many take seriously. Right?

It's terrible vicious circle. Wow. thought challenge trials considered unethical medical community.  Maybe RPCT (hope right acronym) going slowly anticipated.

I‚Äôll keep using rubber glove hand sanitizer gas station. not? It‚Äôs cheap easy.

r/childfree Utopia? SOO far it... know atleast one guy wrote book critical Justin Trudeau released election year like 1984 thought police thugs guys investigating charging ridiculous nonsense releasing book critical Trudeau

I would never describe socialism kind utopia like... Sorry. That's terrible Dude also man man there‚Äôs really life frantically searching Twitter anecdotal reinfection cases 24/7. Like something else man. There‚Äôs much arguing people internet really random topic. Lol bro embarrassing hilarious absolutely father, well colleagues, generalize morality motivations resoundingly negative. 

I‚Äôm aware he‚Äôs one example many, doesn‚Äôt he‚Äôs money-hungry man gets bankrupting people like seem believe doctors are. Believe me, goal every doctor, *much* easier professions go accomplish that, lol. 

He bemoans cost healthcare lack humanity insurance companies/pharmaceutical companies/hospital management, helps much he‚Äôs able. say, it‚Äôs hands much hospital drugstore charges, misplaced anger thread towards doctors people? 

In private practice, control prices, gladly adjusts waives fees needed, goes point comment replying to, doctors benefitting suffering others. They‚Äôre enemy, big pharma corporatized healthcare are. even *were* enemy, that‚Äôs job government fix, individual doctor. 

I also like say ‚Äúthis reality us‚Äù, assuming it‚Äôs reality me, too. I‚Äôm financially independent him, healthcare providers families living like Kardashians mind, right? ones gonna care. People already make masks bandanas random cloth rather actual surgical masks. long something covers face one seems care. K. still, even benignly, supported horrific country guilty war crimes invaded another country. I'll get morality lessons somewhere else, thanks. Eh, probably refer Spanish Flu debates. Pretty much 0 chance winning. Oh wonderfully fun times live :( Well-off suburban districts. one school, believe.

Just sucks. want annoy hell Pfizer Moderna whomever calling non-stop see need trials, I'd like useful. Yep, people making suggestions realize enthusiasm little kids look forward Halloween. big deal them. 5 year old conversations every weeks new idea decided dress as. eat candy, loves event people out... sights sounds atmosphere. Thank considerate. novel. People know know school‚Äôs nurses longer? CDC trying hard destroy whatever shreds credibility left. Jesus fucking Christ America shit hole. This. I‚Äôm kinda surprised isn‚Äôt higher. It‚Äôs lot easier vote rage, guess. Yeah, people shouldn‚Äôt send sick kids school. you‚Äôre staring loss job, eviction, groceries, car payments, etc. that‚Äôs harder choice be.

Also, we‚Äôve heard ‚Äúthe schools safe, we‚Äôre following protocols. Look hand sanitizer spaced desks!‚Äù possible people might believe bullshit send kids sick ‚Äúprotocols‚Äù protect people? 

A lot failures here, parents. call whatever want, either pay it, judge issues warrant. choice. use one little banana turns 3! You‚Äôre obviously single mother. true. enough analysis shows excess deaths approximately 80% due covid. know vast majority excess deaths covid. Let‚Äôs try pretend otherwise. would dishonest. Gotta build herd immunity. midwestern school district never nurse, graduated 2010. Meds given office secretaries. Top down. publicly taken Covid seriously privately lot people would've done same. We're mess majority Covid deniers following lead. They'll skip first go right second. Yeah judging downvotes asking. want apology Burger King giving straw  median death age 84 years.

Where finding statistic? Sorry still possible read text. add special characters? poor penalize following law. gonna go Jackie Daytona mean what's point one see toothpick? definitely help curb cases COVID deaths knowledge, touted massive breakthrough immediately undercut availability. What's rate young people dying this? confirmed original comment.

I never disputed it. always page. :D

Like said, I'm going listen scientists doctors, Agencies controlled political appointees. That's trashy article posing academic article full speculations Yeah I've trying convince someone that. Mind you, sitting railing injustice given Assange, watching recap every night. C.O. Vietnam. Yet full Bezos, Walton Family, Gates et al profitting this.. Gates personally hand due population control. Ye gods voted 45, going again. Sigh Stop masks! Covid scam. never wear masks Wisconsin unhealthy, I'm surprised death rate. Maybe need look meth excessive drinking treatment method. Canada signed COVAX, they? explored, it‚Äôs every list ‚Äúwhat pregnant‚Äù right sushi fresh unpasteurized milk. deli meat big known. Social media fucked us up. Save money old man. cannot depend us. ""How annoying cynic internet: Post"" ü§∑ mean Busch light? excess death attributable Covid, ways people died covid still killing people. making intellectually dishinest statement absolutely facts back up. possible even start coming contrubuted excess death year over. Trying misleading best. Seems like raising white flag would bolder time I've heard ""civic duty"" mentioned America someone asks get jury duty. still sure celebrity makes expert Corona virus rules.

I'd like drop [some celebrity's opinion  tolerable best option entertainment, (admittedly questionable) value content spoon fed you, fail see paid TV could ever rival paid internet connection. honestly obsolete, least generations grew closer internet TV. really understand Sweden advised people wear masks already. Face masks low-cost high-yield solution preventing spread COVID-19, stay-home order forced closure, least pro-mask. go work punished expect. always sent sick kids school. news anyone children school before. take seriously pre-existing condition immune suppressing meds (rituxan), however, 9 year old step-daughter's dad all. takes visit friends, indoor birthday parties, last weekend Six Flags. He's told ""people stare laugh wear mask"" kinds dumb shit. 

If love mother (and her) I'd cut losses gtfo. Fucking sucks shitty people exist. one counted transmission trees? It‚Äôs like comparing someone starving someone able get favorite doritos flavor store. point crazy comparison is, come say ‚Äúwoah woah woah lets play oppression olympics here, ones struggle less valid anyone elses.‚Äù

Bad Bot Bring damage virus causing many people's bodies, wonder repeated bouts virus do. Oh. thought talking umbilical cords. Whew!  Yep, anyone disagrees dumb, understand, master. Yeah see tons people go grocery shopping, soon cashier hands receipt immediately take mask *before even leave store*. God, fucking hate stupid selfish people country are. Oh okay sure, yes, hard know really outcome - perhaps vaccine beginning end, least socially. I'm sure others live, know turned city upside-down, everyone follow science, know people also antsy resume work anticipating guidance moving forth vaccine arrives. :) I'm curious 'numbers' well. means diminishing circumstances 'long haulers' dealing good media target. would imagine percentage/number people really long term complications quite low comparatively. again, stories get clicks.... Sure. NPIs successful reducing spread infections - seems - time takes get results favor less effective versions. beat it, submitted sacrificing chunk people. blessed low population density do, case death toll would many times higher. need help find biggest asshole Washinton must rock, drank far much orange cool aid next door neighbor little decade growing up.

I maybe even understand US since it‚Äôs exactly secret virus everywhere there. Canada, Europe, Japan etc. excuse putting place?  best part still insane wait times! live urban area near impossible find PCP b/c one taking new patients. made appointment dermatologist suspected skin cancer (it was) took month get appointment (luckily diagnosis got appointment removed 2 weeks, cost nearly $700 insurance). I'm thankful PCP willing work find anti-depressant worked sever depression, b/c could find Psychiatrist taking new patients.

Our health insurance pay shit, costs arm leg, still insane wait times. Stay Canada. Nothing US health care works. Nothing. Nearly equal drop party members. Yes, genome that's predominant UK Victoria, no-one tested who'd managed isolation strain. 

I think we'll ever know now, I'm hopeful increased measures - army charge, far fewer compassionate exemptions, compulsory testing quarantine workers go long way making border watertight. 2018-2019 flu season estimated kill 30k Sure thats significantly less covid, thats still 30k people. thats 10 9/11s, 70-80 fully loaded 747s crashing. thats deaths youd get nuked town Eureka, going look eye someone lost mother, father, son daughter flu tell party outing friends worth loved ones life?

thats reply someone else thread said covid dangerous flu.

So ask shouldnt close schools, close businesses, restrict peoples movents freedoms, shit year flu. Yeah definitely want listen anyone gone decade study /s directly ties Trump he‚Äôll het fired Stephen Miller find modern day equivalent Josef Mengele. Good thing schoolchildren teachers ones getting /s think it‚Äôs feature rugged individualism that‚Äôs inflated current events. used united country. looking everyone banded together WW2 rationing food, collecting rubber, Metal, grease etc...no new cars produced several years. Etc. happily dealt it. 

Contemporary Americans wouldn‚Äôt make single sacrifice like today. People can‚Äôt even put price fabric faces without freedom tantrums. someone anorexia recovery, thank caring partner looking taking seriously. one good ones.  attributing excess deaths to? true. think saying *ideal* people would stay home spread would stop. don‚Äôt think people predicted America nowhere near ready even mention education... actually chance one...

I truly believe American exceptionalism exists anymore (nor care much needs to) knowing billionaires vast majority wealth. time war, military matter... unless National Guard taking countrymen. Nothing America great anymore. think time period somehow correlate times pretty well fact everyone back ""white"" (lol, remember guys south?) Tens thousands people work six months.  big deal.

There‚Äôs reason can‚Äôt open reasonable restrictions. Mask usage, indoor areas, reduced capacity make social distancing enforceable. Right. I‚Äôm clear study works. seems targeted result number low accurately represent population intended take vaccine. Ding ding ding, nailed first guess, I'm stuck UT. America bad pls upvote Read article. Wisconsin actually break record Wisconsin set April, even close. Odd headline.

I guess saying going another wave, far much lower, would accurate, wrong message. Got banned asking logical question.

lol!! dont like that... Southern hemisphere... like Australia definately seasonal illnesses.. fact Flu rates near Zero winter season Covid measures. Covid effect everyone matter season. Upvote ""frisson"" üëåüèº area they've two weeks now, already ran senior dosage too. Check doctor local pharmacy. mean first COVID proven kill many people flu, also flu vaccine moment people certainly cautious spread flu well. sure bad thing?  Yeah...except dont constitution, constitutional rights.

We charter rights suspended government time given proper reasons, like mentioned back spring.

&amp;#x200B;

Our brothers sisters think they're yanks. Lmfao!!

Its internment camps them!!! heheh!! Making masks less fortunate... room world. occurred people respect elected officials due station age?

They certainly exception rather rule. Hence whole lack empathy thing. God people evil.  year, year. Chinese advertising fake capabilities product? Never!!! . I'm fully charge 500000 mah chinese battery bank, fill half phone. remain camp started in: vaccine becomes available general public shown effective safe (with minimal side effects), sure, I'll get it. think general public waiting awhile happen, though. Production, manufacturing, distribution availability due supply/demand. Stuff like that. USC student say *we open person*.

Look, get whole ""spoiled children"" narrative plays story well, campus one strict California right now. Classes 100% online, dorms closed, greek life completely shut down, get tested *as often want free* 48 hour turnaround, need health check temperature reading even entering campus (on which, buildings except health center locked), mask wearing social distancing enforced campus police, people living home parents.

We're lot right colleges would we'd much better place.   dont mind wearing mask think logical. One thing horrendous province Quebec, trying pass law quickly allow police enter private residences without warrant. say make sure covid regulations respected feel loosing rights. understand people dont care careful big parties much.  *still* idiots refuse wear masks. far opening up, numbers going down. candy shape paintballs, catch meaning. took forever even get questionable ppe here. yes soon allowed takeout restraunts especially smaller mom pop even never takeout adapted week. Servers still suffered inside dining restraunts surviving thriving. Go California!!! Ageism reduces human beings‚Äô capacity caring too. Globally, people don‚Äôt value elderly lives much young people‚Äôs, research shows.

This dumb I'm actually speechless. shortage flu tests? article says there‚Äôs shortage covid test ingredients. Could link source shortage flu tests? can‚Äôt seem find use ivermectin deworm sheep, got whole jug barn. I‚Äôm rich! would advise reading Phase III trials deciding along agencies trust. Don‚Äôt rule US made vaccines. early trials, Moderna‚Äôs Pfizer‚Äôs seem significantly better neutralizing immunity Oxford‚Äôs. current administration full self interest corruption, doesn‚Äôt mean shouldn‚Äôt trust vaccine made US. Pretty much. Good, finally good news related Covid. held hostages Halloween little morons parents begging free food. I've tried tried. think Reddit someone called ""proudly incurious"". They're people know better. They're people adamantly proudly look things like facts real numbers.

People know better helped.

People want ignorant can't. Wow. think *I* would like this? No! course want go back normal life... everyone does. important lift restrictions safe so. happen soon vaccine reaches public.  üôÑüôÑüôÑ incivility? okay name call one person someone else? 

lmao okay. Cops wear masks system sucks. solution cost reduction back patient.  make sound really complicated. NOT.  try generate billions profit sick people, requires machiavelian creativity. much make? Hmm...lets hire analytics, lets increase rates, lets restrict provider network make money. Lets deny care.  on. nightmare greed, waste patient suffering.  
Medicine never related business. unethical. term (not expert) noticed largely absent covid-19 information risk management.

Restrictions gathering size definitely risk management technique. numbers based something, agree arbitrary. say they're louder, visible. Folks understand importance masks also believe sheltering home. folks see wandering around outside leisure likely anti-mask brigade. 6 feet save indoors. virus give travels 6 feet. 


You wearing mask indoors regardless distancing. come charter private plane. clear target market is, masses. I'm OT see patients home mostly. incredible see many believe whole 6% thing. They, half dozen conditions. Big ones like heart disease hx cardiac arrest, cancer, stroke. know got Covid right risk person without conditions. got it, died complications caused, cause death would COVID absolutely cannot accept normal, regular thing healthcare. dad died cancer primary cause death listed pneumonia. people go back smoking drinking much since that's primary reason died? Tam stupid saying ‚Äúslow burn‚Äù virus. virus know grows exponentially. It‚Äôs eliminate virus keeping Rt far, far 1 it‚Äôs gone nothing. ‚Äúliving virus circulating keeping check‚Äù think it‚Äôs reflection culture reflection today‚Äôs political environment? know country prides rugged individualism Great Influenza 1918/1919 Americans didn‚Äôt quibble wearing masks known effective preventive measure. One styrofoam great, guarantee drive two hundred miles month get food farmers market bigger carbon footprint right now.

Your styrofoam packages also delivered, presumably car. drive cars, mean carbon someone else's bill. responsible carbon that's emitted stuff gets delivered you.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, ED ?

In mind image someone recovering erectile disfunction spending 1 year somewhere cabin woods, coming back society 1 year raging boner size sequoia, funny right now.

But suppose case ED stands something else. 51% enough separate so... guess that's mark majority. Pre Covid evidence around masks limited confusing. actual scientific analysis, look (TLDR: evidence people wear masks better people wear masks, likely due mask wearers careful general. clear masks help) (TLDR: fabric masks seem help, retrospect, study badly flawed design). *much* better evidence around mask effectiveness now. 

Early recommendations based past pandemics like SARS1, state people wear masks feeling well, SARS1 large pre-symptomatic transmission phase, whereas COVID turned different, 40% time infection happened someone felt perfectly healthy time, recommendation changed ""wear mask sick"" ""wear mask, might sick"". probably would made change earlier fear panic buying resulting shortage medical grade masks would cause healthcare systems collapse. pissed it, industry shut withering. know least 5 people personally shuttered businesses co workers able support families. I'm Canadian I'm wondering poll? Friends told poll using landlines mainly what's percentage? BC general 'Berta 'Berta. well kept secret. Damn, maybe stop importing China, like US 51m unemployed people making masks.

Where US factories go? 

Wasn't US industrial powerhouse produced ships, tanks, aircrafts rest world combined 1945? Lol. Guess back trusting scientists reddit Well some.things say tattoo shops come back. Maybe gone bankrupt return new ones open. People want tattoos. some.people want feeling safety even there. Casinos large scale couod take.longer. ton people would go ton won't. Casinos large similiar setups need ton people exist. may still problem. conclude every country complex economic system can't judge one single metric. lost insurance lost job July, already made much subsidies Obamacare. decided go without, one afford $600 fucking income?! 2 days later got letter saying approved Medicaid (where live 1 form apply subsidies Medicaid). seems Obamacare screen annual income, Medicaid screen monthly income. Since monthly income went $0 qualified! live pretty liberal place, maybe rules different?

Can appeal Medicaid decision? He's earnest he's saying.

It's designed add fuel fire continue leveraging minds people still support them, think pandemic conspiracy exaggerated, etc.

He'll say whatever going help retain gain votes. He'll _portray_ whoever thinks needs portray retain gain votes.

That's goal. That's game. He's appealing _attitudes_.

He's fucking things everyone else care: sole existence built satisfying impulses. 

He might live 80, he's aware this, attitude careless can't comprehend higher purpose beyond pleasures. Taxi Uber drivers, too. still better t-shirt 'us' wrapping around faces?  Fake news, ""ECRI testing imported FFRs revealed 60-70% provide sub-95% filtration performance"". 60-70% imported masks N95 class. basic surgical masks. Goal post moving stupid people say complex topics can't understand order challenge importance topic. Republican take whatever ‚ÄúDear Leader‚Äù wants stay control re-gerrymander state Republican wet dream. N95 masks widely available outside US? really understand there's still shortage here.. like WW2 build tanks defeat Germans - basically fancy fabric. people careless dont take basic precautions easy cheap (masks, distancing, hand washing, essential activities, etc) , life wont move die someone else's inability refusal protect others.  majority US congress members presidential candidates geriatrics. get treated fine people think deserve respect. respected might appropriate ask sort social parenting decisions led estrangement children.   wrong basing ignorant conclusion Observational data. dont know make clear.    mean either idolize actually vote guy pictured once, twice wearing brown face. Maybe masks became sentient started speaking them. Wait - think figured premise next Pixar film!  Well everyone else takes turns ok  Okay neighbors. get it. You‚Äôre much smarter respectful neighbors.

/s    Canada electricity imports can't generate enough yourself.    hospital Canada CEO   Reopen it.  Meh, (beyond investors/potential future funding) cares who's first, long works independently verified?

Edit: directed op. generally race mentality. Race find one works, rush first sold. Good products sell own. Right, I've messed around much repeatedly asked I'm wrong. come back garbage every time. Troll elsewhere... 

Good bye   disney***LAND*** closed. 

it open since March. Even without guests that‚Äôs still lot people work. shitshow. Besides filtration concerns, public health experts criticized KN95 masks their¬†inability create tight seal someone‚Äôs face.

Maybe KN95 Asian leaky American faces. so? lot colleges seeing bad outbreaks small towns, still accomplishment keep virus spreading control amongst students.  Downplaying risks activity pandemic great idea. CDC highlight dining restaurant one major drivers cases. 

This seems like dangerous misinformation me. holes them.... lol sure that. trying maximize good avoid case increases prior election, time open would ~10th October. one time (knock wood) flu, tired watch TV week. slept stared wall prayed death. sick another week that, could least watch TV reclining couch. cold flu thing. concept civic duty far-right idea. scaring people, something applauded. find ones don‚Äôt really wear mask public dudes giant beards. Edmonton, lot dudes giant beards.. Precisely that! Moving around even little bit good overdoing also important. bodies made move around, even little bit puttering makes huge difference.

For example, high risk pregnancies, found people put full best rest higher rates mortality miscarriage. also one reasons older people start losing health breaking hip‚Äîlack movement. one reasons (but reason, obviously) ventilator causes issues.

Other industries good. doesn‚Äôt seem much ‚Äúexceptional‚Äù American ingenuity going - friends china owned bars already reconfigured business sell discount PPE purchasing bulk shipments reselling WeChat, 30 days crisis.

Exactly reason said havent mastered shit socialize pretty well mask on. friends family. see different, I'm sure hard ""I wanna wear mask can't see lips move"". always something. that, ""I can't breath it"" ""I medical condition"" (mind you, I'll guarantee don't, use excuse.) always excuse wearing mask become politicized.

I think degree human nature. acknowledge lives young generally worth old. Objectively simple quantitative evaluation. None criteria lists test...

Yes, point, reason believe anything normal pneumonia. winter. gonna think related flu season something. look it. probably entered system left that. went next closing lab

Sounds like lab supposed run tests, told directly, someone willing overlook kept results secret. Also, Wuhan health commission jurisdiction lab Shanghai? Yes, work connection hospital, different health authority. reopened allowed study coronavirus January 24. idea rectification would mean. would assume enforced directive, took data, destroyed lab samples. gave professor stern talking protocols publishing without permission.

Also, part published journals referencing different article. can't seem find now, news articles referencing it. seem think caixin article sure. remember seeing posted subreddit months ago. later deleted mods, maybe see problem that? 

It's COYA thing hospital. happens states too. Basically, 'Hey! allowed that. reminding rule cover asses decide anyways.' Nothing wrong it. CPC need better whistleblower protection system, know system would abused assholes spreading misinformation claim whistleblower status. 

I may projecting cynical nature though. Sustained H2H transmission 

I would interested know original Chinese CDC team came sustained H2H transmission. surprised 'waiting evidence' part due Wuhan officials trying make look less bad. making labs run every test step needed meet every checkbox sustained transmission. probably hoping problem goes away, thinking part severe flu season.

And second team re-visited, Dr. Zhong Dr. Li Lanjuan said happening. two around SARS happened, probably saw actual numbers saw bullshit. reported beijing prepare containment measures. HA! I've got place soon completely paid off.

And yes, human interaction optional. people complaining mandatory masks violate rights, yet hear explain forced wear clothing junk public violate rights. People afraid seeing body part getting COVID. One kills, not. companies plan first look mere 32 coronavirus infections accumulated massive 44,000-person trial. case total could reached soon Sept. 27, according Airfinity Ltd., London-based analytics firms tracking vaccine trials. **Pfizer also given four chances get** preliminary result, reaching **the final goal working U.S. National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, **won‚Äôt dive 53 cases occurred; ultimate goal make judgment 151 diagnoses.** Cancer powerhouse **AstraZeneca,** collaborating University Oxford, **will take first look 75 cases, trial complete 150.**

These numbers seem little light.

Eroding trust experts public potential short term gain, fucking pandemic? cooperative well-informed public crucial characteristics contain virus best abilities, don‚Äôt get actively deliberately misinforming public, whereby sacrifice necessary characteristics. Apparently associated parkinson's also. FML Reinfection, even asymptomatic implies that. keep distancing measures masking time being. Journal Plague Year talks happening 1665.

That's true, got wrong US. per-capita numbers lie. get 300 times worse (per-capita) countries best equally competent response. Surely see this? people focused problem NZ?

Nope, say all, I? weak strawman.

Trump interested re-elected, that's it. cares about. Anyone think Trump competent leader cares citizens watching different president am. barely string two sentences together, even saying clever is. damn son Fuck virus evolving Also 20 lbs fatter! right. problem Spain tracing. ppl got infected required give locations went contact with. biggest reason control again. government rich rich built backs working poor nice development, let's hope holds rest week travelled Sweden UK weekend. think FHM probably right. People around UK seemed far happier get close tight spaces Sweden. Personally found much uncomfortable.

Also number people UK wearing properly. Constantly touching front touching face, putting pockets covered potential germs.
I'm pro masks keeping distancing possible wish people used properly. it‚Äôs West Virginia... look France, Spain, Isreal, UK see happens remove it. ‚ÄúPublic Health Madison &amp; Dane County also seen dramatic increase positive cases. large proportion positive test results, on-campus off-campus testing, linked UW‚ÄìMadison students.‚Äù please stop buying China.... that's works..... duh I'm sorry mom forced teach person. Schools person classes yet. Hope stays safe. understand policy be: test 3 days leave test land, test one last time three days landing. negative: good go. know test shortages states, many states seem testing capacity people wanting get tested. Oof....now worry exploding asshole. Oh thought that's told reinfection super rare. 4 doctors. 1 city. Yea. Game changing 2027 something. classic costume ""me, without haircut regular sunlight past 6 months"". pajamas course. places hit exceptionally hard early pandemic hit again? Spain people wear masks. problem many spaces need wear them. restaurants, bars etc. night clubs Madrid open. mean gods sake, give employees unemployment benefits loan company money pay rent etc. It‚Äôs worth opening night club pay salary 20 people potentially infect 2000. tried suggesting another social media platform. well received. Peolle want FREE candy kids dress up. heaven forbid little one can't dress get diabetes year. S/ chance. People stubborn. work better people actually wear Reported active cases. Gz! good news! Thanks 2020. would actually fun...if freezing friend Hawaii said actually big hard drug problem people went high school never moved away island. said there's much tourist, many locals directionless turn hard drugs. actually fucking nutbar. saying right poor districts see unfair get restricted reality also spreading richer parts town. poor people still work richer areas, restaurants bars example. close Madrid. poor neighbourhoods. multi-billion dollar vaccine industry risk proved, course denying reinfections even many anecdotal cases. Follow money... re-infected then, need worry him. sounds extremely promising. breakthrough, even. still long way go develop molecule targets ""pocket"", could, next years, yield revolutions treatments respiratory viral infections. Absolutely agree! (The full face built faceshield:. ) criticising political body failed handle emergency means it'll fail next time pandemic. Diceases keep happening, continue suffer prepared. less shaming politicians making better system everyone live in. think full story one thing note SF's population density 2/3 NYC. fact many non-touristy areas within bounds SF suburban. Additionally, SF's populace tech minded due Silicon Valley things like Instacart low touch services may easier adopt. Still feel like fully explain see advantages SF going pandemic. believe breathing holes thats problem. kid going wait three days eat candy. kidding me? Oh yes report numbers terribly inaccurately here. It‚Äôs like significantly higher COVID death toll ww excess deaths anything. one thing done well Sweden, it‚Äôs keeping numbers accurate. Spain quite good mask use. it‚Äôs working. bars restaurants packed. Spanish people uniquely unsuitable deal pandemic like this. mean gave containing tracing virus months ago... slow tear population (or fast one, depending distancing). Id rather see blast younger population build resistance populations isolating risk. think colleges k-12 schools like early wave vacations- herd immunity youth strong midwinter. 

As long kids wear masks distance side college bubble make difference amongst night. True, except believe lot virus killing UV blocked glass. 

Since I‚Äôm losing car oven thanks fall, place set masks directly sunlight nothing block UV, I‚Äôm wondering allergens mask since would outside. probably stop lazy buy more. Haha amazes parents risk kids life 3.00 worth candy That's Halloween mask, lifestyle. Fomites thought 10 25% infections.

SuperSeeder Events (SSE) tend main driver. SSE's accounted aerosols.

Shelly Miller , Skagit Choir, 2020, etc etc.

If find touching face, I'd recommend face shield well. Protects eye mucal areas (conjunctiva) contain ACE2 receptors well. Oh sure. main approach public curfew, people banned leaving houses. Physically welding people houses happened several locations, like additional measure rather main method.

I‚Äôm Glad recognise stopping virus spreading interest public good. approve China‚Äôs methods human rights standpoint, said cruel. I‚Äôm going discount it‚Äôs effectiveness, people can‚Äôt go around spreading virus physically confined location.

Sorry seemed like supporting China, really don‚Äôt. stand statement. run subreddit popular demand 30 days. idea means I'm assuming half world dead time discovery utilized released public. likely case virus pushing people edge illnesses illness overwhelming already taxed immune system. likely see increase lot illnesses result. masks I've made got test really bad smoke (450+ AQI) last week. I'm pretty confident filtration now, worked great really wanted find out! Scotland think general consensus need lockdown might well rather couple pointless restrictions don‚Äôt know rest uk reacting. defense... food good hope ü§û things work out.

Makes want scream War spectrum in, WiFi spectrum, spectrum ISP, could completely understand going war ISP.... stuff pretty crazy though probably case setting expectations anything. said next 6 months that's it, told people expect restrictions place 6 months.

If boris proven full shit several times I'd take quite positive actually, expect april 2021 start go back normal. can't miserable like rest us :( ... modelling suggests could 26,000 excess deaths March 2021 result ongoing restrictions medical Overall analysis estimates could total 81,500 non-coronavirus excess deaths next 50 years result longer waiting times non-urgent elective care, well increased deprivation resulting deep recession.

 Hmmm. Modeling. mention increased deaths lingering health issues virus.   know lot Canadians would except don‚Äôt really actually rights Can't fake hospitalization rates definitely fake positive test cases. really think 334 people virus April? Fauci said 70% effectiveness best case means effectiveness likely &lt;50%. isn‚Äôt going away kind numbers. sources August.

I guess taken longer two also said Sweden hit herd immunity April.



This claim asked source on, appreciate trying help.

thank you.

also, found source April Tegnell thought Stockholm might get herd immunity May entire country april. lost 41 lbs. since December 2019. Still trying lose more. 281lbs, almost diabetic high blood pressure. Losing weight, swear saved life. course working home made much easier work regularly. One cram schools Tokyo neighborhood kids wearing top regular surgical masks. idea why. feeling gonna get way end we‚Äôre waiting suffering nothing article June says they‚Äôre going increasing testing upcoming flu season.... there‚Äôs shortage Yes take sum coefficient divide 3, still idiot spreading misinformation. fair he's Wisconsin. I've seen couple times.  Let's forget widely available drugs also kill coronavirus, would go hand hard vaccine stopping pandemic. Umm.. people understand Halloween fucking cancelled year? serious question? I'm American stuck home 8 months. 45% Americans underlying conditions put risk. believe everything hear media. Lots us still stuck home waiting safe enough rejoin society. Dude check straps tin foil hat, think might bit tight. Thank telling region Delaware one. Perhaps NJ &amp; NY CT approaches Pennsylvania getting contact tracing app buying KN95s days want counterfeits must avoid masks ""3 NOs"" called China. quote believe are:
1. Manufacture Date
2. Manufacturer name/location
3. Expiration date

From limited understanding Chinese internet, believe called certificates conformity counterfeiters generally include caught without them, guilty selling counterfeit epidemic prevention products, counterfeit certificate punishment severe (?). Perhaps defamation legitimate company? Idk, Chinese law something I'm knowledgeable about. That‚Äôs thing gives hope ‚Äî we‚Äôre going break record vaccine three years.

I see lots people talking we‚Äôll permanently change behavior build pandemic-proof cities. won‚Äôt. We‚Äôre going figure basically 3D print vaccines novel viruses emerge, get timeframe 12-18 months months. Lmao F*ck True. Hubby &amp; understand fuss was... Yeah 1 100-200 die.... That‚Äôs pretty fucking big number. There‚Äôs reason rest first-world countries aren‚Äôt fucking thing.  know science science, expert's science science? confusing. Climatology experts somehow agreed global warming, makes believing science much easier. Damn. I‚Äôm sorry! No. Virtually one done many interviews Tegnell certainly none small country. example slagging rest world. arrogance knows bounds. It‚Äôs really quite ridiculous coming someone responsible one highest death rates world. Nobody expecting virus gone. seems subset people think goal eliminate entirely wearing masks, social distancing vaccine...but gonna sorely frustrated vast swathes population moves on.  nvm. found so-called harsh lockdown means private gathering max 10 people. Lol joke. got irritated conversation looked up. took seconds google.

This also said Sweden hit herd immunity April.

and wrong. maybe is. found interview end April says similar thing Stockholm. maybe read something else, since provide source, way think 25% people Stockholm exposed coronavirus possibly immune. recent survey one hospitals Stockholm found 27% staff immune. think immune transmission society, workplace. could reach herd immunity Stockholm within matter weeks. 

That's said April 28th.

That stockholm could develop immunity sweden.

That's sources matter, human memory sucks. Dude can't link source widely discoverable. onus back post. Yeah I'm discounting delivery estimate, tend make massive orders packages delivered day.  Even didn't, realize delivery vehicles carrying packages well right? carbon footprint gone pandemic, that's mostly normally take bus walk grocery store, longer go farmers market, live regional transportation hubs. got vehicle move get medical center there's emergency. idea trying hypercritical, order ever? course SCMP reporting Richmond. Half overseas interns come Richmond. Spain France example seem increasing numbers despite face masks. throws false positive every 100k tests! people think do?!!?? might stay home need awaiting second test confirmation!!! Think lost productivity damage economy! block larger farticle droplets. taste anything may properly fitted. ...at ones peril. I'll chill inside get sick like normal people should.

If free I'll take I'm paying anything super important right now. Read article. numbers still ridiculously low lot people don‚Äôt know cancer autoimmune disease. We‚Äôll continue lose lives stop wearing masks soon. surprising May 20 right around time things started go Welp, called it. max 10 people, Wuhan. even Sydney lol. one point, could 1 visitor max. Thank reply, long last you? vaccine prevents transmission, covid-19 may pushed fringe population. point, perhaps may find remnants vigorous. could years road. maybe vaccines likely reduce severity. I'm speculating, would really welcome even years respite shit.  Central Valley, CA. got states wearing mask 70+% REFUSE wear them. San Francisco Bay Area, opposite. way we‚Äôve evolved sense science technology. considering quickly vaccines coming along, science really pulling weight here.

But human nature exact 1918 Ugh thats whole point mask...sheesh...well...hopefully fine personally would err safe side. well~ You‚Äôre implying produce mutations could make virus worse. Selective pressure means behavior causes one specific mutation win another one. trying micromanage socially engineer *disease*. collectively going wake madness dragging lunatics us. That's logic? Really? wow. say 'everyone' then? Bet that'd get responses/attention. Nothing like comeback ""yeah, die? "" faced disease unknown possibly long-term effects. Yup Ah, forget lot places still long waits test results. meantime it‚Äôs hard say do. It‚Äôs week think you‚Äôd exposed quarantining would pointless. Good luck well! testing moderator bot. One posts political automatically removed political. Obviously one wasn't....hmmmm  iOS 14 well. Banana fucking republic. need government that's willing break monopolies. asserted without evidence may discarded without evidence. We're sitting around 250k dead domestically, untold amount covid survivors dealing long term health complications

Re-opening/herd immunity sick joke that's going hurt us long run. It'll hard move forwards covid survivors dealing lung, heart, neurological issues. There's social safety net people economic relief health issues/medical bills.

It *global pandemic* Americans many examples better ways handle situation. South Korea 381 dead. could us society recognized health greater good we'd cohesive messaging leadership

Your really address anything beyond ""rada rada like we're difficult time""

It's ignoring facts data available us today.

At point screaming. really offering much go end though. decision smart? re-opening universities good future world?

It accomplished exposing people virus bring back home communities. exacerbating situation we're stuck in. applies scientists taking part interviews international press then? ego trip? exceptions? help identify those?

Ah article referring - comes across pretty reasonable, would agree? makes think they're working?

Evidence shows numbers would higher mask use place.

It's akin saying seatbelts work 'lots people die car crashes.' doctor's office lady pulled mask cough, facing away I'm pretty sure still within six feet, quarentine keep eye symptoms? I'm moderately high risk makes difference Fake That's definition gaslighting.

And really easy billionaires appeal government without making press.

Bezos flew NZ days economy tanked Feb: bunker article 2018: article reiterating point 2020: ""entrepreneur visa"" NZ cost tens millions, especially wanna fast track it. know guy flew Waiheke late Feb. He's 30 minutes Gates. Nope. data that‚Äôs readily available shows mortality 1%. question accelerated development approval process thorough enough uncover potential side effects, particularly long-term ones?

Listen, I‚Äôm mechanic certainly don‚Äôt walk auto shop they‚Äôre repairing car tell stuff read internet. that‚Äôs many people approach medicine science. sick took vitamin C confirmed worked despite existing knowledge topic...they‚Äôre clearly expert. ‚ÄùSweden let COVID-19 spread hopes population would develop herd immunity.‚Äù

Not true all.   zookeeper costume went Harambe zookeeper years back. Winter sell KN95 online Costco.com. bought box 100 sent box mom. They're fantastic. I've privileged good insurance basically entire life. never thought I'd ever difficult situation travel another country get surgery medical help like people know. no. way. CDC can't even honest Covid spreads anymore, getting US approved vaccine. I'm waiting another country greenlights one figuring get it. experts too, agree obviously dumb thinking so-called expert. community that's generally afraid telling people wear too? sure common is, I've heard plenty stories cyclists spit wearing lycra shit like that. You‚Äôre right, haven‚Äôt I‚Äôd want kill ever worked stem job. fact is, science math, answers either right wrong. takes certain kind brain wiring able enjoy something like that. You‚Äôre reason many people negative view stem. Sure, stem creates lot value society large calling important softer fields study retarded. live USA? Also live progressive city? Perhaps people know lots doctors? would trust implicitly others wouldn‚Äôt trust borrow car.  follow politically charged comment.

It common point discussion reduced access health care reduced mental physical health causing increase deaths. 

Feel free read topic appears well educated Japan: makes smartest supercomputer world tells us deal coronavirus.

Also Japan: continues wear face shields anyway what's logic? voted Trump 2020, again. restrictions VS restrictions tradeoff. aware virus back January. saw individuals videos Youtube happening China, China trying keep virus eyes West. 

Yes, restrictions. think would happen kept everything open past 6 months? would like last years flu season US, lot deaths. Okay, can't support claim, like said before.

I know whether Sweden seeking herd immunity point contention. think likely Tegnell said something similar recollect, trust vague recollection thing even know read directly.



why I?

memory faulty, mine. could remember paraphrase title people took said.

You said stockholm 30% antibodies. turns like 7%.

this another specific claim could sourced. possible talking Stockholm country whole.

The point source could read myself.

so sorry hard source claims, believe without sources. found evening.

I'm saying much selective pressure virus right now. Lobbin jawbreakers kids heads human face wired social interaction brain.

It's inconvenience, anyone says ignoramus.  Underage drinking ( least ) uncommon, charged. many countries wear masks fail keep numbers low anway. Obviously masks work theory, seem problems making work practise.   Assuming vulnerable people get vaccine , always case uses live virus. Whatever keep voting, trust government state sanctioned media tells promises you, care much family. ask one Algonquin people, millions people exposed radiation atomic bombs radiation experiments, syphilis experiments, WMD's Iraq...or one CHILDREN Trump raped help Epstien Maxwell... outlook life lead negative effects.. preparing worst preparing fail.

Sure, can't compare blu-ray, still looks way better normal 1080p content. still talking me? You‚Äôll die excess CO2 obv Well frankly yes. would make even sense compare countries like UK. kid goes school WV. county Orange status supposed remote learning. county Orange. People complained came Gold color instead changed county Gold. sure Gold means classes held person. really wonder one thing regarding scientists propose controlled spread the""herd immunity"" tactic.Dont worry long term effects Covid all?It boggles mind experts would propose sth like study study mentions long term effects heart,lungs,brain,kidneys etc... instead quote Anders Tegnell 16th April.

Den 16 april sa statsepidemiolog Anders Tegnell p√• Folkh√§lsomyndigheten att Stockholm b√∂rjar uppvisa tecken p√• flockimmunitet.

 Vi √§r n√§ra en niv√• n√§r vi, enligt v√•ra modellerare, b√∂rjar se en effekt av flockimmunitet.

Absolutely ridiculous claim. like yours. screwed over, know proud of.

[Ever seen clip watch mouth I‚Äôm gonna take shit asshole Lack access health care. sub that! wallow misery together. accusing implying anything, there's clear difference two thought processes. Politicization CDC FDA eroded trust institutions. There's lot conflicting information coming week depending gets hold mic. reasonable person would reason question things coming now. virus, reasonable person would question virus real. Encouraging others wear masks fact creating danger others. many others lost lives due advice? ""different political view"" matter life death. can't speak people comparing others, feeling better worrying others getting worse. Particularly neighbouring Nordic countries special relations. utility also works electrical amazingly. utility would amazing internet. know (not accounting installation maintenance) cost per customer something ridiculously cheap like 25 cents per month? fair installation significant cost *mostly* one time cost. Maintenance also dirt cheap. I'd bet internet would cost $20 - $30 per month highest speeds US utility. society realizes higher education America evil corrupt big business, things get little better. AWEHHHHHH

ALMOST 12 years public school taught something understand looking consistent important politician however global pandemic would perfect cover introduce change opinion. think it‚Äôs generous though (you probably nice person) say ‚ÄúJoe can‚Äôt change mind else look weak‚Äù, it‚Äôs likely doesn‚Äôt want universal healthcare. necessarily. Sex education often left individual school district REALLY gets left parents school district hard complain. really good sex education town california next town they'll teach abstinence only. Also liberals still fairly right winged. higher religiosity rankings greater political conservatism higher adolescent birthrates.

There's good article unesco followed research articles. I'm also disease intervention specialist government focusing reproductive health, mainly try prevent stillbirths. super interesting topic me. got questions, got answers. Fire away. Figure speech inflation, guess. Well, first reason lack early response. 

The second reason non-complaince masks social distancing. work well half population it. 

Republicans stupid selfish. make covid related treatment FREE country, socialist manner, racking tax debt universal health care like Sweden.

Stop comparing case counts March case counts September. 1000 cases March meant perhaps 10k cases. 1000 cases means lot less. Look positivity, hospitalization etc. Sorry hear that, though wonderful them. Well course would prefer that. make comparison relevant. mean cloth covers nose mouth I'm pretty sure does. Obviously lot nose mouth holes obviously often, wrong politicians remain office manage convince people party hindered efforts. disagree general, got rear-ended July going get takeout food someone else going get takeout food. :( really believe lockdowns ""time off"" driving made many people really bad it, I've seen much dumb shit road since then. perfect instant litmus test infected, Covid issue. don't, many things help 1 10 Covid positive people get scanned temperature show elevated heat told isolate get tested helps. took swipe BLMs chatter anti-western nuclear family brought race it. gender.

It feels like turned partisan bickering GOP saying Dem governors killed tons nursing home residents Dems saying there's evidence support assertion. Giving birth America costs $10,000 average complications. counting pregnancy care healthcare baby birth. read really sad articles families struggle years get debt one babies difficult birth. 

IMO birth rate America going start declining. people government media going say millenials selfish hate families, actually people decide want baby (or another baby) means life poverty. They're much changing guidelines clarifying move transparent. knowledge never much way guidelines released previously apart 50% efficacy threshold.

Do really think waiting median 60 days post inoculation unreasonable? ""science"" simply adverse side effects sometimes manifest immediately also people get exposed virus immediately receiving vaccine (plus incubation period, time test results, etc.) anything, 60 days sounds borderline inadequate. made testing free, treatments? Hence people getting pretty hefty bills mail days. OP wrote control group needs 5 people severe covid 19 Test Probably not. Dane county seen big spike new cases since UW started back hospitalizations still near record lows, probably student population generally young healthy therefore likely develop severe cases.

While they're certainly contributing rising case count - may ultimately lead hospitalizations spreads beyond campuses - universities probably blame (current) increase admissions. American doctors order every test sun cover asses case get sued, another charming tradition US. uncle, retired anesthesiologist, lived constant fear sued something nothing with. also spent third year working malpractice insurance provider: that's malpractice insurance cost him, third income.

I'm saying wear masks home, qualified guess would groups friends way relaxed mask usage Spain. Hence spread. added gold people complaining kids able play sports.

correct I'm wrong though.. likely both. issue never medical side things reducing person visits. Lol, numbers lie. Texas one corrupt states US ""I giving away One-Shot!"" stated, wear mask, encourage others so.

I agree you, obligation vulnerable among us wear one.

That said, resent forced wear one.  I'd gladly wear one voluntarily. choice removed, forced, penalty law, compliant laws, resent masks.

Its mask itself. point out, cloth.

Its mandate. lack choice. lost freedom, exercise power government us. 

Its really mask. mandate. Tell FDA forget hate. ""Fuck I've got mine"" official motto, emphasis ""fuck you."" Yeah, insurance industry greedy, people hate everyone else much hate idea someone might get something need. Trump know if/when find whether got real vaccine placebo? like rubber band stretch chances breaks how'd it? absolutely worse look stats race. Black women significantly likely suffer stillbirth, maternal death, birth trauma, injury birth. 

A lot stems systemic racism medical field, well systemic misogyny. Despite US‚Äô abysmal healthcare system, pregnancy Medicaid available, well state insurance low premium who‚Äôs income exceeds limits Medicaid. Pregnancy Medicaid income limits significantly higher traditionally medicaid...even middle class women qualify. problem program varies state state, jin areas providers hospitals accept terrible. states, abundance doctors, midwives, hospitals, birth centers accept it, giving woman far choices resources. 

The problem that, whole, obstetrics field US practice evidence-based birth. standard care pretty outdated, and, cases, dangerous. paired hospital policies designed maximize profits CYA, protect serve patients. 

There also huge problem doctors nurses dismissing women‚Äôs concerns problems. Telling women they‚Äôre overreacting dramatic bring valid concerns like, ‚ÄúMy feet swollen headache won‚Äôt go away,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe baby hasn‚Äôt moved much today.‚Äù attitude gets worse woman poor, uneducated, POC, especially woman educated pregnancy childbirth. don‚Äôt know headache won‚Äôt go away sign preeclampsia, don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs something tell doctor. 

And that‚Äôs care birth. leave hospital, care mother non existent, societal support mental health services. It‚Äôs horrible. work home read pessimistic shit Reddit day. weekend go real world every restaurant filled new capacity 

Neither extremes good. Vaccines cure illnesses. preventative.  already it, vaccine anything. powder give ball cancer Definitely depends state, MD we're fortunate married salary low enough qualify state program. cost 3 kids one 25$ copay insurance cover genetic test took precaution. Unfortunately takes metric fuck ton effort find, read, understand different programs set finances qualify. life Sweden basically back normal

Please stop spreading misinformation tell smart knowledgeable write one sentence per paragraph. Plus empty rhetoric use. hitting enter every period like dope, using compound sentence structure, making coherent point well. Oh shame. honestly means wisconsin hospital space, accept people. honestly doesnt even mean much. states turning away patients keeping even serious cases home without hospitalisation. meant care enough wisconsin made effort tend people setting quarentine areas treat patients. yes, many people dying homes without hospitalisation turned away due full capacity. Obesity bears blame There‚Äôs never really sure fire treatment respiratory virus. Don‚Äôt remember learning kindergarten? ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs cure common cold.‚Äù apply Medicaid CHIP, likely major hassle **and** everyone approved. 
Secondly, childbirth covered I'm mistaken. hear way many stories Americans baby getting bill, copay, several thousands. fucked up. kids teenagers, normally we'd party year we're taking opportunity marathon horror movies they're finally old enough watch. I'll leaving bowl candy bottle sanitzer drive way poor kids whose parent's take out. example, revised estimate global working time lost second quarter (Q2) year (when compared Q4 2019) 17.3 per cent, equivalent 495 million full time equivalent (FTE) jobs (based 48-hour working week), whereas earlier estimate 14 per cent, 400 million FTE jobs. Q3 2020, global working hour losses 12.1 per cent (345 million FTE jobs) expected. Fucking duh. Mommy daddy go work. Oh, Florida made sure get good sick leave day one, universal healthcare, recommended everyone work home much possible, etc? Sweden's approach also people following recommendations, people follow recommendations? people trust listen authority, ain't Swedish approach all. 

Please tell me, part Swedish approach Florida try? like idea, y'all gonna figure something us seasonal allergy sufferers. Unless gonna give us 6 months year PTO. I'm cool that. guys protesting basically nonstop around time anything, thank conservatives ""normalizing"" socialism. used socialism meant former USSR, China, Nazi national ""socialism"", etc. they've successfully branded socialism publicly-funded Healthcare education; makes basically everyone who's far-right think ""If socialism sign up, comrade!"" where's corporate money that?! Bro, think capitalism! Right?? I've visited UK Europe several times society overall seems less stressed/anxious US. Recently dreams, whenever someone wearing mask get subconscious feeling ""this right... mask on"". anyone else get this? board certification big deal, lots doctors practice without it. expensive test take every set amount years (unless older, think people grandfathered in). FMLA Covid specifically. Regular FMLA unpaid too.

Edit: BUllshit Reported cases don‚Äôt equate total cases. 30-40% people entirely asymptomatic mild cases go unreported Sir fear sub   article again. guys fell last two Times sure third time. Don‚Äôt forget goes opera - I‚Äôd bet age distribution follow pretty much age distribution covid fatalities place like Met. parent ok underage drinking party already irresponsible. see Venezuela (and really ""socialist"" country) plain old authoritarianism sold public socialist rhetoric. tactics Nazis used, relies less nationalism (usually) less genocide.

There's reason happen, usual outcome violent revolutions. US exception, norm, there's reason think would happen leaders voted office maintained commitment democracy less way now. really hate simplifying, often wrong country stereotypes, talking ""belgian mentality"", country famous divided heterogeneous, step above.

Seriously, swedes blond, rule obsessed guy afraid conflict displeasing others. 10 million people here. Many foreigners countries drastically different Sweden. reason, apart wealth economic development, able follow rules everyone else.

Frankly, good Belgium wants try different strategy since previous one seem worked quite well metrics people use blaming Trump every covid death country left-wing media talking point. enlightened media give shit you. Trump force Cuomo, Wolf, Whitmer, Newsome stick covid patients nursing homes ? Corporate sponsors media want hate do. money know it. Donald Trump threatens lot bottom lines companies fools used against. integrity. hope enjoy Trump's re-election much do. That's get siding violent mobs pedophiles. üòÅ Haha fool. could ever vote person Oh sorry, Swedes breathe like people countries? currently job that's described ""Temporary Part Time"". job since march, yet work week less 40 hours (and occasionally work weeks 48 56 hours) - excluding weeks national holidays (like labour day). idea makes part time, though temporary part job handle extra tasks related Covid (which dont actually do, jobs neglected regulars time covid tasks).

Ok, I'll bite. 

Why? far.

For confirmed re-infection, someone have:

1. Received positive test virus;

2. Recovered, gotten negative test virus;

3. Returned situation could re-infected;

4. Become re-infected;

5. Receive another positive test.

The bar fairly high, requiring least 3 tests, following pattern, specific lifestyle behaviors. happened past 7 months exactly easy, especially since, earlier weeks/months, tests hard come by. Someone say ""I know March"", never got bed got positive test result, going count.

With many variables could skew statistics lower, far early call re-infections ""statistically insignificant"" data.  WOW ALMOST LIKE PARENTS NEED WORK ONE WATCH KIDS??? read: Americans immune July due previous COVId infection. 500,000 New Year's Day.

-Donald 'Eggshell' Trump, probably let COVID-19 spread hopes population would develop herd immunity.‚Äù

They knew virus would spread counted herd immunity result spread. even closing anything lockdown, needed cover noses mouths bit common sense. asked. Instead dangled masks around necks, went vacations partied there, came back partied here. Went multiple restaurants bars. least happened here.

They can't even accept even tiniest bit inconvenience. Someone ends hospital/ICU, that's better inconvenienced 5 minutes. husband's co-worker like ""isn't hard breathe?"" 

Um yeah nurses doctors wear 12 hours, wear short periods. mean people understand people work construction? wear really uncomfortable respirators strenuous work? fire fighters?

If job, wow. little thing that's kind uncomfortable annoying. People hard things time complain. Maybe try one people good community. school (in conference) limited gatherings max five people students, told students leave invite guests area next two weeks. yet football team still home game weekend (with another full team visiting), plans traveling away game weekend after. would okay restrictions placed students applied sports teams examples. seem arguing wrong thread.

Yes live New York City. think neighborhood something bubble.l based people said. I'm Montreal see tons tons people wearing mask properly, nuts Yeah let's ""buddy"" cases lockdown areas probably spike compared non lockdown areas opinion clear! 
Just one, oh he's alone. sure heck part growing number scientics doctors many experts including 20+ years phd experts working viruses agree lockdown done improperly. 

 im seeing people locked elderly people underlying health conditions. rest population developing herd immunity. 

 undeniable majority deaths people underlying health conditions elderly therefore ones protected!!!

That done ever, actually opposite done... Italy New York actually suffered high death rates, happened within healthcare system sick elderly nursing homes. numbers lie. 

I know many connected ""Real Hood"" areas community next fact may hard swallow: hood never locked down!!! all!! Yet significant spike people hood dropping dead Covid. ask call herd immunity call Hood immunity.

Either way, cause concern. China‚Äôs population closer 1 billion 2.

That said, parent approval ASSISTANCE would great. I'm sure many ways get ball rolling honestly can't think many would ""legal"".

You know Chinese still complaining lack government control epidemic worst control measures stringent! implies COVID killing actually policies consider medical priority. decisions made policy makers COVID. Two words: breathing holes. speak entire population Sweden? That's interesting. bet know exactly millions people think there. 

Yes that's point herd immunity could possible people continue take precautions longer epidemic/pandemic problem. contained population less effected next flu season aka 2nd WAVE. Compare Sweden's death rate US'. Sweden's neighbors even Europe seem better off. black America statistically indistinguishable living developing country.  banned.video may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Who could‚Äôve known .... i'v wearing [knitted ctulhu (i bought 3 them) past two months (i'm Victoria, Australia, masks currently mandatory public) knowing full well they're good N95 masks, baffle air coming mouth protect flying drops people. perfect, good enough. hope whole system collapses soon re-invented positive (and maybe even affordable) manner time right.

With people charge would recreated even bigger scam. read article? I'm assuming benefiting company office workers then? refer people help make life easier? u read article? literally getting info article. vote away peeps u like article says! Yeah seriously sure ""still born"", lost 18 week old boy 5 months ago. rhyme reason, stopped being. poor wife still give birth, catholic hospital didnt ""the procedure"". Poor woman 20 hours labor him. Unless already drug targets thing going phases already made market. huge. cheap, effective treatment exist may even need vaccines. simple - virus floats air right? Therefore simply float AROUND face shield.

Don't need 'supercomputer', anyone else tell that, common sense. thought active cases purely estimate? recall changing month ago. Either way, cases seem dropping that's good thing. claim, going go find source rather emphatic claim.

I understand source conclude probably mistaken.

let know find source Hmmm examples fraudulent behavior would you? I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve seen multiple places they‚Äôre already mass producing Vaccines going ship day they‚Äôre approved They‚Äôre UWS honestly provider dependent. It‚Äôs recommended CDC (previous CDC, inept CDC) treat based symptoms initiate test determine it‚Äôs flu based obvious symptoms. believe you‚Äôre putting healthcare professionals risk, *and* tests expensive. wouldn‚Äôt say ever shortage, it‚Äôs necessarily important get absolute diagnosis it‚Äôs super obvious it‚Äôs flu. providers (in experience urgent care ER nurse) order people either ask it, want prove patient not, since people don‚Äôt trust doctor‚Äôs word. Tamiflu honestly takes like day symptoms away, causes side effects fair amount time. 

Now they‚Äôre admitted hospital, usually run panel respiratory tests determine level isolation floor staff. 

Not sure links, 5 years experience ER urgent care. flip flopping political thing. Changing conclusions more/different evidence scientists do. right. he's also wrong. Could people visit other's homes? Early stockholm 30% antibodies. turns like 7%. sure search article back bunch. actually find curious would consider masks now, seems Swedes seem think beat virus. prove wrong pendejo? I'm half latina, know talking about. easy answer would government step economic support people can‚Äôt safely jobs *actually take steps control virus* could reopened safely. US Citizen I!

/S Interstate borders open again. rest country basically back normal, can't travel overseas. putting people jails, means compliance rate low. worry, people would rather panic things. 


Let's ignore fact likely die ""tHe cHiNa fLu!"" murdered. 

Just panic this! Yes, Ottawa cannot use public transit, even Uber, unless you‚Äôre wearing mask. Going mall, forget it. There‚Äôs already 90% wearing masks, don‚Äôt one handed one get inside. shops hand sanitizers inside entrances. I‚Äôve even seen woman approach security saw man wearing mask.......they fined escorted out. fuss like mess US. Meanwhile, schools like FSU Alabama thousands cases playing football fans. Muh freedooms need provide sources schools haven‚Äôt already, aren‚Äôt currently, aren‚Äôt planning mass layouts right now. Yes thousands schools they‚Äôre basically running capitalistic models pattern replicated large scale. would way way rare find school isn‚Äôt currently firing tons staff mitigate profit loss find them. 

I provided ton sources first hand experience happening slew schools. 

What schools actually talking aren‚Äôt currently this? Asking apply job there. Holidays ""frivolous BS"" way art, culture, companionship are. need body live. bodies. Rates depression tripled pandemic. People feeling isolated, hopeless, anxious, overwhelmed. Holidays allow us engage rituals strengthen bonds, bring structure lives, release tension via time-limited indulgences.

There's nothing moronic that.

\[See: \+ actually *physically entering grocery stores,* something need survive, unless there's zero grocery delivery curbside pickup area. Mask wearing pretty much issue America. rest world pretty clear fact viruses exist Yes, cloth masks rarely used here. mostly KF94 followed surgical masks.  Shit family got uncle it, still think it‚Äôs flu. Reddit filled experts coronavirus responses exactly losing shit about?

Yes, humans nearly eradicated number diseases. Polio great example - vaccines effective it.

Yes, humans much healthier terms disease 200 years ago.

I can't fathom outraged about,

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Prove wrong then, India Argentina fake lockdown enforced implemented properly nothing reduce R0. China, Italy Australia real lockdown. Thanks sharing, it‚Äôs interesting article. think need differentiate deaths due lockdown Vs deaths due fear hospitals. Even didn‚Äôt lock down, people could still fear going hospitals die reason believe Texas Arizona sent people could travel state hospitals room/staff. People really short memories. It‚Äôs literally impossible prove anyone got covid. don‚Äôt even know you‚Äôre sick 2-14 days got infected. It‚Äôs pretty much impossible retrace steps 14 days pinpoint one moment caught it.

Common sense says we‚Äôve always known touching contaminated surfaces get sick. CDC still recommends frequently washing hands disinfecting frequently touched surfaces. follow guidelines safe. They've said deaths covid directly caused virus died heart attack ""assumed"" put ""covid"" death. lot people even tested assumed it. There's bunch people filmed interactions hospitals talking people even test kits said symptomsYou could possibly symptoms also things. even think possible put actual number amount deaths directly caused covid lack tests early months seen many also said Sweden hit herd immunity April.

do source this? issue page many counterfeits there. supply masks Guangzhou Kangbang, there's way know real company. There's even counterfeits Korean (KN94) Japanese (DL2) masks now. #BigIfTrue I‚Äôve worked Amazon long time. see bootleggers time true lol. Unless you‚Äôre dunce got conned several times, you‚Äôre honest. You‚Äôre argumentative sake surprise it‚Äôs Reddit lol. responding easy man, don‚Äôt trust people easy, could cost life. really question whether. question when.

If politicians announce vaccines scientists say ready, soon get vaccinated.

A months later, scientists reach consensus vaccines ready, one works best, time.

Pay attention scientists, politicians.

It usually easy tell difference. person finished his/her MD PhD degrees decades ago, working CDC university ever since, scientist. person MBA JD, appointed position CDC recently, not. prohibits U.S. visitors, except immediate family Canada, entering country modes transportation, **including plane**.

Is invalid restrictions apply land crossings? do... saying people previously infected wear mask. virus deadly nearly everyone never knows unless test tells so. Try telling to... majority people know Canada even Democrats realize literally everything Putin meant sideline U.S. 

He wanna best friends U.S. President, wanted need ""friends"" U.S. President all. taken seriously E.U. (check, meets E.U. leaders helluva Trump), countries begin things unilaterally without feeling need U.S. support.

He swooped try save Iran deal, met Merkel Macron discuss middle eastern interventions without U.S. well tried broker deal Ukraine, he's trying save easy opportunity respectability points. 

I'd say resounding success him, really. Plot twist. smell match experiencing covid symptoms. know read? covid? HR 100 too, month. occasionally still, think anxiety. buenos aires wuhan-style, supermarkets drugstores open   silver lining. read study?

Here let help. 

This Professor expert spread covid 19 talks findings regarding Sweden potentially beaten covid due low current cases per 100,000 people compared countries like Italy significantly higher still!!! attributes difference sweden Herd Immunity, due severe lockdown. Iirc, find potentially earlier SAE AZ trial reported? so?

I really see students able focus well school right now

It's stressful af times difficult everyone

It hurt delay things year society figures *global pandemic*

Instead half assed everything sake $$$

Universities care students getting sick beyond bad PR generates; cared student health, they'd kept everyone home Well shit good thing go corner store pick mass produced readily available American made alternative! /s  point COVID-19 impacts ""virtually nobody"", kills people prime life, 80 year old people care homes. 100% what‚Äôs gonna happen fuck complying rules realize thousands colleges universities. Surely plenty meet budget deficits layoffs many  Stop trying drag US politics divisions Canada, Russian bot. Don‚Äôt worry. fools don‚Äôt determine restrictions place, public health officials do. administration changes November they‚Äôll get even influence soon. it‚Äôs lot fewer people die get ahead yourself. read wrong. Extremism even begin define politik. Really, pandemic demonstrates efficacy propaganda. Enough people believe authorities without ever asking proof cook scamdemic, chemical weapons attacks, WMD stockpiles, whatever want majority public focus non-issue like masks, ISIS, state sponsored terrorism without second hesitation. 

Meanwhile, where's healthcare y'all wanted? wear mask. made shit please. video August 15 aljazeera prove point . true, it‚Äôs important also examine votes defund education, donors are, goals are. Systemic problems (such poor public education) aren‚Äôt accidents. cares rational discussions push America bad rhetoric imaginary internet points. Reported using facts go narrative social circle, Chinese people. I'm saying Chinese people exist, numerous people made be? Probably not. society ""functioning"" without culture. bet gone waking hour without consuming kind cultural stimulus. Pop culture, internet content, runs life. Nah. drive around big loud truck huge american flag tied trunk door  said COVID. say anything essential activities flu. sure many times say seem bent blurring lines conversation. Thank link. Let‚Äôs honest tho - Americans probably thinking ‚Äúif it‚Äôs around neck I‚Äôm still wearing it‚Äù ‚ÄúWELL MOUTH COVERED WHATS PROBLEM?!?!?‚Äù. thanks Put way, numbers simply rise ease restrictions try push another lockdown, protesting. pulled claim far butt...

60% US population getting flu shot every year? Pretty sure that's amount US population can't afford call ambulance. waiting explain it. matter masks anything, virus airborne, dinosaurs built pyramids.

Must true. read CDC website. Haha gotta look homies. Yea man knew exactly meant. mean shit, look last 8 months. It‚Äôs internet‚Äôs favorite thing world, shit people perfectly adhering CDC guidelines. know, there‚Äôs nothing internet loves reason look someone else. Unfortunately agree feeling isn‚Äôt going away time soon matter health nation. Cool story bro. right-wing losers here, mean subscribe Fox News too. seem problems blatant racism, guns, anti-maskers, conspiracy theories etc Americans claim free speech god-given rights. Thanks Meanwhile Mexico beg people mask nada. Swedish school year also July August. dip week 27 33 might that. Deaths never spiked proportion cases like April. wrong. Compare two curves course pandemic. 

That continue happen; CFR continue driven learn virus. guys weird fuck.

Masks big sacrifice?

Can't interact people slight distance?

None would survive Scandinavia anywhere remote. Definitely top candidates go Mars either. approved Health Canada idea somehow enforcing basic precautions state federal level ""one-size-fits-all"" issue ridiculous. state mandate, they'll argue it. county mandate, they'll argue it. city mandate, they'll argue it. point area small enough mandate? single house? entirely self-absorbed. limit. That‚Äôs narcissism is. mistyped *patpat* moving towards Swedish strategy immediately reintroducing lock downs. 

It‚Äôs old story heard opened apparently proved Sweden‚Äôs strategy right along. 

Except countries spend time building test capacity on. 

We don‚Äôt lock test, trace isolate. Something couldn‚Äôt March/April. something Sweden still quite bit behind far tell - still testing, tracing isolating people clear symptoms. Opposed ‚Äúwave‚Äù following holiday we‚Äôve year? 2020-I miss concerts all! poor neighbourhoods got cuarantined hope one contests it? Also parties involved extreme left: Podemos M√°s Madrid super moderate. IU goes way more.

What fear new age hippies anti-mask manifestations doesnt logic apply flu? 46%. Clinton got 49%. options. 


There two parties vote Canada actual chance winning. idolize Trump anti mask vote Trudeau. hope someday soon able bring kids enjoy games like us younger. I‚Äôve heard issue drugs. say gun violence. say it‚Äôs political. say it‚Äôs mix three fueled lack mental health services lousy unaffordable education. It‚Äôs sad refuse believe stay way.

PHS Patrons,

The Governor's announcement yesterday declared change Provo Orem Orange level Utah's Health Guidance System indicated ""moderate risk"" community spread COVID-19. level restriction allows high schools host games events prohibits spectators.

We happy announce venue Friday's football game Wasatch High School changed Spanish Fork High School restrictions apply. Start time still 7:00 pm. announce Homecoming Royalty recognize hosting Homecoming Game another venue bit unorthodox, best option allow spectators game.

Face coverings required enforced throughout game. want wear mask, attend game. need part keep community healthy, keep school open, give students chance finish seasons. what‚Äôs alternative? reopening isn‚Äôt option lockdowns don‚Äôt work long-term solution, propose do? LAUSD teachers marching went strike. already raise, struck class sizes support staff (nurses aides). That‚Äôs good way start marriage. Unless want look back fondly say. Remember got people killed? Good times! mandate means nothing unless enforced. Cases skyrocketed Wisconsin past couple weeks. postivity also high days around 20%. Somehow, we've managed keep deaths though. I'm sure wisconsin able that, could change hospitalizations quite bit. Title smells like agenda, good news. Leave political BS another sub least flair differently. comment makes sense, asshole serves purpose here. good day. wear goggles, n95 covered another mask full face shield go public. noncompliant American public, proper standard follow indoors. fully intend get Covid. face shield fully enclose eyes without wearing goggles important Covid transmitted eyes. wrong.

Republicans like push Sweden's ""herd immunity"" strategy means get plebs back work. Never mind reality Sweden's strategy fact completely failed anyway (5 times death rate worst-performing neighbor). woulda thunk? like walking barefoot snow wearing gloves hat is. Oh come come think he's going learn you? mean pick adventure predictable responses:

1. ""What ever happens, happens. God's will""

2. ""See covid bad, worse flu""

3. ""I still believe personal freedom. wear masks, well that's tyranny that's country stands for!""

Go ahead take pick. R0 spread unimmunized population, dependent behaviors. R0 NYC higher March South Dakota. R0 high inside prison. R0 lower world socially distances, reduces interactions, wears masks. 

It‚Äôs consistent say social distancing mask wearing reduce transmission, R0 still ~3 60-70% population needed herd immunity.

R0 much US appears well 3 *because we‚Äôre reducing transmission* careful behaviors. much US, R0 appears ~1.2 (we‚Äôve reduced transmission ~50-60%).

Herd immunity defined 1 - 1/R0, 20% enough.  recognize definition doesn‚Äôt line think be, immunity fragile (for instance revert pre-COVID behaviors, R0 rise R rise 1). 

To clear, Rand Paul honest back-and-forth; arguments ‚Äúlock-down‚Äù inane. 

But Fauci‚Äôs statement weird also semantic. There‚Äôs way 20% immune infection doesn‚Äôt significantly decrease R, strong argument places like AZ, FL, NY R 1 ‚Äúadvantage‚Äù. America we're freaking one instance China finding COVID salmon we're trying aggressively reopen 100% numbers, lower were, still high enough pose huge risk. school waiver parents signed able administered tylenol advil nurse Ya'll fucking children. agenda.

I thought discussing success democracies dealing pandemic. pointing list provided examples small islands (with exception South Korea, is, effect, island hand, democracies like Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, New Zealand fared exceptionally well. 

In conclusion, get fucked, reasonable point y'all ashamed incapable discussion. 

My actual view democracies effective people. spend education shifted toward collectivist cultural mindset would likely effective anywhere else without need draconian power.

If can't discussions can't improve society. According Republicans country definition socialism reason considered ther devil's spawn.... Good luck! kind funny imagine attitude would US virus say, 25% fatality rate real lockdown effect. 

Like, leave house go jail get shot, troops bring rations home type lockdown. 

I'm glad I'll probably never know can't see ending well. contacted work waiting get back What‚Äôs said 100% accurate city. 

Honestly though nobody actually believed could school year without basically everyone getting sick course year. didn‚Äôt think through. Everyone‚Äôs sharing desks tables keyboards ect entire day. can‚Äôt good enough job disinfecting surfaces classes tell students sit contractors isn‚Äôt possible. say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt come symptoms‚Äù fine, asymptomatic people spread too. highschool age kids across nation contract school year ends.

Poor people go doctor never find baby born without lungs already died shit like that. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* repost? fresh yesterday's NHC report posted it.

I believe already discussed similar case believe people never leave homes unless absolutely to, government said to. people know face-masks exist, wear face-masks go out, government recommend them. believe government recommends wearing masks, paranoid people suddenly believe masks make invincible, they‚Äôll start partying, hugging strangers, attending large gatherings, etc? seems ridiculous me, since government could say ‚Äúhey, masks reduce risk 50%, continue carry precautions.‚Äú

Staying home highly over-rated preventive measure. works nobody household ever leaves house reason. member household leaves essential tasks like grocery shopping doesn‚Äôt wear mask, person might bring virus home slowly spread household. Well, yeah. less fearful Okay Parents probably send sick children school partially cant afford take time off, moment become less employable.

If useful left fall wayside. Like every European country. Yea, Denmark thing. It‚Äôs work, take specific measures spread ‚Äúcool down‚Äù - wait panicking. I‚Äôm Stockholm already taken measurements working 100% home, 80% don‚Äôt mind staying home. students probably don‚Äôt want miss school either. It‚Äôs easy get behind miss day two. Except news developing long-term organ damage potential spread families, sure. fuck think viruses work dude? Ok, thank taking time explain depth. area I'm well versed in; always remember hearing news Brown serious budget, never looked much deeper that. useful context now. side note she‚Äôs 3 miscarriages close enough noticeable need checked taking protection rather keep trying make babies.  ethics challenge trials thousands die virus every day + economic harm billions? ever get COVID EYE I'll consider expert. try young healthy? government much.

Congratulations!!! Hoping everything go well!! üôèüòá Wow. barely get home SIX days year sick kid.

I‚Äôm pro life don‚Äôt understand supposed make speechless change subject? mean statistics, thing anywhere close deadly though initially, especially therapeutics.

Old people need hunker down, know idk tell you. Also wearing masks nbd spread, let's go protest large numbers! could go wrong! ... Rand Paul idiot. What's new?

Mostly chuckling committee chairman say Sen. Paul's antics. Apparently ""norm"" him. Hopefully Ontario. What's open Michigan? Ontario seems like everything except casinos open difference masks mandatory indoors. Gatherings still restricted schools open government zero plan teachers spend half day making sure 5 year olds chew mask. affect COVID respiratory viruses much, disinfecting surfaces help curb infections via fomites, always good thing.

While true mutations tend variety weaken virus, mutation roll dice opens potential make things much worse. 

I mean imagine tomorrow found newest strain 35% fatality rate. feel like code ""the governer it"". remember proclaiming ;) could take comment exchange word 'college' 100 systems/organisations/practices also joke. two-part tribalistic political system one example. everything wrong Masks don‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs definitely much weaker, otherwise would lot deaths based number people already infected. Thanks  alternative going pretty scary, especially automation really starts remove industrial factory jobs. Stillbirths don‚Äôt tend cut up. Trusting government much. Also many people follow rules gets real. NJ statewide funding. called abbott funding. answer districts problems even New Jerseys bad schools better decent ones across country. depressing see Pennsylvania it. 3rd highest district factor group well 4th lowest, I'm South Jersey generally less wealthy, live 2nd highest rating k-8 go there. live also 2nd highest district quite expensive schools really good) 

""They created 1985 result first ruling of¬†Abbott v.

Six weeks PTO per year.

My boss aware that, unlike vacation, sick leave use lose it. (I.e., can't paid like vacation). took two vacation days friends birthday back covid boss flat told probably used sick leave instead, maximize benefits. 

I can't imagine company seriously thinking call sick 5 times year. Especially, mean 5 total days. That's bonkers. actually tenure track professor working higher education. benefits okay, nothing compared offered elsewhere. speak Swedish, speak language mathematics universal, happens teach. tenure track professors smaller universities (like one teach) make 100k, larger research institutions. 

You pre-conceived notions little off-base...  society prioritizes keeping business expenses (wages benefits) low possible keep dividends bonuses management high possible. There's point setting social safety nets system trying push edge constantly. Sweden, get compensated taking day kid sick, people‚Äôs still send school cough fever even now. people suck. ""another deranged power hungry murderer pretending care"" Yep come likely. Chadborne Dejope next imo Ah bless, old deserve title made Mr Gif laugh! Ya, lot 200k lack medical innovation treat covid capacity hospitals. beginning Flu, I'm sure data heavily skewed know treat it. course people going die COVID, vaccine officially know treat effectively.

Just look number cases flu past year; one worse flu seasons. 100% symptoms showed COVID patients similar flu. w coronavirus? shows dumb even Reddit No. may referring this:

Tom Britton, epidemic modeler/mathematician saw case numbers nose dive spring ran simulations testing ‚Äúif isn‚Äôt due behavior/environment, sort immunity required make curve dive like this?‚Äù

And results basically need ‚Äúhalf way herd immunity‚Äù simulation match reality.

Since HIT back assumed 60%, suggested immunity around 30%.

When sero studies came back short (10, 15%) faced criticism. since two bits new science 1) herd immunity lower 60, low don‚Äôt know could significantly lower 2) cells seem give immunity around twice many show positive antibodies. 3) people seem existing cellular immunity.

Taken together I‚Äôd say could pretty spot on.

Note one ‚Äúaiming‚Äù anything. What‚Äôs racist fascist it? Definitely rich greedy, racist? middle $300bn budget? [REDACTED]

edit: ain't 300 billion stupid number Swedes close restaurants bars. Something Fauci looks really creepy, almost like soul eyes. welded individual doors people sneaking out, still videos crawling windows sneak doors welded. like watching Benny Hill video. Perhaps spell appealing old gods end corona? Maybe? Can‚Äôt hurt, right? necessarily, inflationary event offset VAT things. Inflation comes increase money supply, rather redistributing existing money. Probably December authorized emergency use places US opened schools? Particularly elementary. repercussions?  hope explanation could them... Working parents punished, students punished missing due illness. written disciplinary action, amount work missed single day absurd.

This consequence decades bad school policy teaching bad prioritization students families. long schools 100% remote remain issue. Absolutely disgusting open right now. problem goal. one ever said keep entire state shutdown reach 0 deaths. Remember goal high-reaching target, baseline. key task facing governors coming year balance re-opening surges cases. regions let er rip again, tragic results. Others err side caution keep indoor occupancy restrictions place end pandemic, expense business owners &amp; shift workers. sad country make kind tough choices, every generation greatest challenge face head on. 50-100 mil doses end year isn‚Äôt bad, things considered. Oh, epidemiologist? FYI - kids currently school, eat restaurants several times week, returned week long vacation. young healthy, nothing fear. try it. suffering common sense explains lack understanding unique government thinks:

- Foresight: goes magically away

- Investing distribution: Hard work left states

- Allocation: Best stay conflicts costing potential votes. Done market states fight states bid things up

The Trump administration actually approached guy mothballed machine US early year seeing need looking funding said no. There‚Äôs always bell curve there‚Äôs plenty weird kooks within population. still find funny far right wing conservatives using Sweden country many social polices (National health care, tough environmental regulations, etc) anathema far right wing conservatives shinning example do. Lots Europeans travel, get paid time off. mainly Americans travel.

Similarly, Australians visit USA Americans visit Australia despite US population 10x larger, Australians travel whilst still holding job. wait nurse arrive. 

Children died asthma attacks this. Usually doctor's note nurse needs administer inhaler. they're deadly teacher understand call 911 deficit state budget tip iceberg. included various cities, counties, community colleges, schools agencies collectively twice much debt state. still account gaping holes CalPERS pension funds 30% underfunded even assuming pretty unrealistic 7% compound annual growth. still mentioned things like infrastructure maintenance deferrals. point roads crumble money spent, find line item budget. yes, state barely balance budget highest state income tax highest sales tax country, running tight shit, playing million little accounting tricks, they're pretty deep shit. 

At least California unique though. Almost every state rule shithole that's downright hostile lower classes enormous debt GDP ratio cannot paid single digit percent taxes collect. Even without taking side issue ""higher taxes fewer services"", one acknowledge one other, probably need happen eventually. longer keep kicking line, going hurt us eventually. ÈÅï„ÅÑ! - computer does. constantly talk Sweden give wrong numbers herd immunity actually close 70%. campaigns correct logically consistent even true. Stupid af much pay goes taxes? IUP? Idk that‚Äôs smart Well that‚Äôs interesting tells that‚Äôs black people may less family oriented culture. think makes sense given things like homelessness rates well. [For example black people group Los Angeles experiences homelessness rate higher percentage population. is, you‚Äôre Latino schizophrenia you‚Äôre gay family take care you. you‚Äôre black gay schizophrenic likely experience homelessness based this. 

It‚Äôs interesting runs counter notion black people family oriented whites. is, auntie, mom, grandparents community raising you‚Äôre black white people parents grandparents. extremely popular sentiment black people I‚Äôve spoken identify POC. wish reporting mask enforcement home - wearing mask? residents? almost like women home taking care kids men work providing them. Ah, good ol days, children got raised parents instead government. mean? commentators ""Reddit' post one person sorta agrees him. 

He sound like Redditor, sounds like Facebooker - basing arguments half-truths, unequal comparisons, unproven theories. live country sick days people still show work sick. Deadlines need met, work needs get done. daughter's school pre-covid pretty much insisted sending sick kids school. fever needed school excused. extremely sick contagious without fever. fucked up. It‚Äôs almost like workplaces punish taking care sick kids

Yeah, kind - workplaces simply ignore fact outside life schedule things always show work time work 110%. means ALWAYS pressure work faster, panic prevents planning future. Congratulations, modern day slave corporations now. Oh goodness you‚Äôre king thank you. Hope you‚Äôre right! option

There certainly another option. Overthrow ruling class. needs active resistance back normal vaccine comes.

this problem entire argument. going back ""normal"", pandemic one many symptoms world that's rapidly changing due human pressure. That's it. novel pathogens arise, pandemics likely happen, food water become scarcer, insane weather events become common. 

The vaccine merely band-aid sucking chest wound. Get used new world, adaptability makes humans resilient. Glorified? Home what? Mom's probably working keep Healthcare coverage. Kid can't stay home alone. Done, like damage I'm waiting comments fake communist propaganda, since, know, Vietnam communist government. 

Oh, wait, forgot criticism communist governments apply China. Carry then... India's infections deaths already surpassed U.S. 

Their testing limited recently, numbers entirely bogus. Can't count infections deaths test. got email public school system here, city moved orange red cases directly linked university talking about. please explain imaginary college bubble speak Wow that's shocking never thought I'd see US /s whole point get kids house parents go work. Broadcasting lessons accomplish that. ‚ÄúKiDs AfFeCtEd!!! Oh staff is??? don‚Äôt care them. Think CHILDREN.‚Äù HERD IMMUNITY DOESNT KICK UNLESS ENOUGH PEOPLE TAKE VACCINE.

Herd immunity won‚Äôt shit, it‚Äôs like 6 months, won‚Äôt end pandemic.

And getting fucking vaccine, leave covid door mutate, render vaccines ineffective.

If don‚Äôt want get it, fine, stop fucking bullshit excuses group behind every vaccine skinheads say you‚Äôre fucking scared really shock? people cannot afford take days work care child self-isolate they‚Äôre exposed aren‚Äôt receiving sort assistance Ahh, even think age range. Excellent point. one panicking defending argument? Hah, adorable.

It's conspiracy theory, gotcha. I'm gonna ignore then. that's bots. Watch downvotes incoming Right? get 8 paid day flexible time per year addition 5 weeks paid vacation feel like baller comes able take time off... cannot imagine able budget everything two hour increments run time. (Addendum)

[Includes sent TSA (DropBox links included) they‚Äôll probably share coming days via ads / something Mayor share later , promoting totally virtual New Year‚Äôs Eve celebration. Yup. happened me. 

3 people department. Manager, 1 designer, myself. 

Other designer, happens owners brother law, got sick (negative result) - able work home

Manager's daughter (who lives duplex beneath him) tested positive. cleared local health department able go wherever needed. Owner company still let work home 2 weeks. 


My daughters daycare teacher tested positive. quarantine 3 year old 14 days. wife also quarantined (she stayed bedroom behind closed doors 14 days - negative case precaution) told burn vacation time. would gone unpaid. one care child, sick wife, full ability work home. get option like coworkers. tests same. sure area would take 3 hours administer occupants 15 cars. live LA, volume testing was/is tremendous. What's name couple wedding? filters suggested equivalent filters (that enclosed hard plastic container exposed surface) effective long breathe provided they're also within shelf life. According 3M course. theory, one conflicting evidence. something base policy on- would OK hourly rate would go 33%. like money. UBI share share problems minimum wage hikes, companies expect money, raise price rent, electricity, cable, insurance bunch stuff although may making $1000 month expenses like $1250 month 9 year old step-daughter's dad

Wouldn't husband? Azar's something protect americans pandemic? can't true Lol I‚Äôm one who‚Äôs completely suckered can‚Äôt offer response apart inane sarcasm Send jail Yes, age friends family (it seems fact life people forget age). people seem like eat families.

I point out, going panera exactly needlessly risky type behavior thread arguing against.

We need real ask level isolation/distancing going realisticly sustainable entire population next 2-3 years. Met need re-invent anything. They've around since 1883 always audience opera. Austria get one work-week per kid year, 100% pay. kid younger 4, second week added.

Unfortunately, situation like current one, simple sniffles suspect, even nearly enough. Masks help airborne spread. first time heard UBI, thought craziest, unworkable, unfeasible idea I've ever heard of. But, made curious find anybody would support insanity. learned, convinced UBI necessity functioning society. quite intellectual ride. mass unrest starts west got Italy

edit person said ""surface transmission"" weird Sweden role modell conservatives. Swedish response ""left"". 

They didnt refuse lockdown save economy. Swedish Public Health agency responsible economy, dont care economy. however responsible public health broad sense, focus coronavirus. example reason didnt shut schools lack education serious consequences long run society individual children. Increasing inequalities, child abuse, asocial behavior, decreased mental health, increased wealth gap etc.

They also used leftist methods fight virus. could locked people homes would much much cheaper, atleast short run. 

For example april highest number people ever (twice high 2019) staying home getting paid take care sick children. children sicker, guidelines says stay home slightest symtoms. Similarly government made get paid stay home youre sick before. Riskgroups gets paid stay home etc. doubt deaths undercounted many reasons - Ghana example median age 20. infections really age bracket deaths would high Hehe gonna play game huh?

#1 quality life subsidized global poor. don‚Äôt understand Canada‚Äôs role neo-liberal world. military participates imperialism directly assists American quality life comes price. done resist? Take ownership. Take responsibility. hey look US daily deaths rate creeping back saw coming obviousman : happening coronavirus know anyone expect anything otherwise?

but yeah, again, great job murikaaaaa Lol system think is. People need work. There‚Äôs thing working society advances point AI everything given stipend. We‚Äôre yet. Everyone work carbon copies mean fundamentally same. issues care about, Biden Trump agree. swap parties, similar ideals identical. 

Both parties literal statement, figurative statement that's used instead 'both parties extremely similar agree virtually nation's pressing issues. differences usually surface level functional difference policy level.'

Lets take climate change example. Trump say whatever wants it, fact 'i save coal' bullshit promises, coal continued race shut across country. Trump paid lip service towards them, policy remained previous presidents mostly non intervention energy next example, healthcare. 'Trumpcare' knowledge real change offered last 4 years voted Senate *Republican* controlled Equality Act easily passed house Republican support. Like laws, like Trumpcare, votes strategically decided many people look like voted base assuring desired final outcome achieved. Trumpcare gone looking like R actually cared didn't.

When equality act reaches Senate, pass. R cast actual votes it, Senate ensure passes. care someone chooses vaccinate? protected herd immunity take care rest. funny Rand Paul brings countries contained outbreaks well (although forgets mention many countries like New Zealand, Finland, Norway Singapore) mention main reason they've done competent leadership.

Saying Trump left states cop out. Since central leadership shirking responsibility crisis valid excuse? delay mass testing unlike US (and lack federal oversight - CDC botched initial tests, took close week FDA finally granted state/private labs permission create tests) leaders went golfing held political rallies start outbreak downplaying severity disease. certainly leaders refused wear masks public.

Ugh, completely dishonest disingenuous human being. Gross. live country PTO joke get all, using PTO cause problems work, many days cost job, affordable childcare bigger joke PTO. think going happen? Could countries around Yunnan Mekong

It‚Äôs theory. defensive Boomers dying greed shitty choices. feel bad them. toxic work attitude many American's can't stay home stop spread Xers/Millenials; plenty buy ""live work"" mindset too.

We need complete reopen. need people dying streets. way end attitude. know sounds harsh need something drastic. need people understand America needs social programs. That's crazy. mind ask demographics fit into? considered high risk COVID infection?

Zero offense taken rather get it. That‚Äôs interesting take, makes sense. Kind sad.  Two things favor:

1) one shot vaccine. People injected Pfizer Moderna last week need wait 3-4 weeks booster shot another \~2 weeks immune response tracked. People injected J&amp;J tomorrow need wait immune response.

2) 60k person trial many people enrolled hard hit Latin American countries Literally everyone could seen coming mile away. certain fraction people gave shit it, however. highly doubt happen. means winter going rough. Yep. usually takes day deprogram spends weekend him. ship mom's time her. Real peach, guy. Mom go work. Plus cost doctors note. visit ain't free. 15 minute PC visit upwards $200 insurance, insurance kicks meet deductible. really answer question. example, I'd personally ok restrictions future covid deaths stabilize magnitude deaths causes like flus/cancers etc. 

Some people would ok higher, others lower. parents work medicate them. don‚Äôt lot sick leave stay home. see time school I‚Äôm at. already started receiving notes saying child coughing, sneezing, runny nose fever it‚Äôs allergies. fill budget gap president stealing money budget apply border wall. prices paying absolutely insane. Admittedly live US, country, *most* packaged services(TV, land-line internet) mentioned 20-75 dollars. 2020 scary costume costume think Paul really calling medical training thought process here. He's extreme partisan hack, anything justify already-decided-on conclusion Nobody wants work now.  it‚Äôs accepted one risks living life, reduce risk you‚Äôd keep wearing mask public forever way wear seat belt every day car... One biggest nightmares looks pretty good, is, vaccine effective.  can't even imagine bravery took participants agree this. adults know virus got horribly sick. can't read article, anyone care post? I'm mobile. Even able call sick, it‚Äôs simple it‚Äôs frowned upon shamed. almost feel worse go work NY go regardless do. Oregon, Cali Washington case spike around protest time imagine could employed something like environmental restoration building homes homeless rather preparing for/participating war! rfa.org proper source. kicked Pandemic season terrible ankle sprain taking last stair step house wrong, (well, I) even leave house wind Urgent Care. (Side note: actually second urgent care trip related stupid accident stairs) one cares shift age range. CDC came said virus airborne. Masks useless point. Based CDC fucked. bunch bullshit. Difference is, Mexico running death certificates, bad

USA isn't.

Stop spread, stop illegals crossing border. prevent abused though? There's always one person ruins everybody matter instance pessimist thinks something like would try take advantage take multiple days month ""sick"". 

If want call sick Navy go straight assigned medical provider base get piece paper signed doctor stating what's wrong return work. considered unauthorized absence status doc thinks faking charged UCMJ ""malingering"" obviously affect career negatively. measures help ensure people fake sick. see working civilians tho lol Great write up. Tagged Covid vaccine guru. I've read, pretty much agree timeline one we're likely see. I‚Äôm wondering many people suffer die understand absolutely necessity. 

We would need complete reopen let people die happen. I'm talking Katrina level shit. Dead bodies streets. need traumatize destroy people's souls take social programs seriously. way end ""I got mine, fuck you"" attitude. Ho Chi Min city one densely populated cities world 4500 people per square km 24,500 per square mile.

Population means little - density going much greater effect potential spread. dismissive attitudes, know rest reddit actively makes fun sub? That's need disconnect health care employment like every first world country. Universal health care way cheaper overall better keeping everyone healthy. really check ""paying less tax"" thing well. true percentage income, make certain amount use certain deductions. Also, European countries afraid tax wealthier businesses citizens kind rates used tax wealthy kid, means tax burdens spread fairly US. 30% Sweden :) didn‚Äôt vaccines pregnancy. think likely umbilical cord however induced last appointment difficulties finding heartbeat negligence came place. rushed appointment. Good ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre listening‚Äù

**In seriousness**, crap linked isn‚Äôt study. It‚Äôs interview saying study researchers think be. trying sound intelligent article one reading ‚ÄúBmJ‚Äù top.

I‚Äôm sure found quick idiots link every time want prove dumb are. Voting isn‚Äôt going stop exploitation Fuck Rand Paul herd immunity fantasy. Shame trying spread misinformation compare US Sweden similar. worst part think knows lot he's saying garbage he's lying pretending pushing herd immunity garbage.

We need people office respect science, junk theories. Eh, Colorado distinguishable ebbs flows. stick one narrative entire country, speak locally well; Polis doing. he's teacher. I‚Äôm Appleton / Green Bay Area friends daycare shut two weeks two employees tested positive. family quarantined among families well. 1yr son awaiting test results. 

Makes wonder employees part explanation caused families. 

My friend extremely cautious limited lives help others, look happens. I‚Äôm making assumptions course it‚Äôs BS. feel pretty terrible them. Nard dog anyone? HAHAHA actually deleted comment like knew would, sad little person. Sounds like post March Damn, would like live amongst logic win: first google hit puts Wisconsin #31. So, even fattest half. 


\#1= Mississippi 
\#51\*= Utah 


\* included DC. dr Faucci Trevor Noah? anyone still listening Faucci? died covid alone underlying conditions accurate statistic provided CDC.

That false statement.

""underlying condition"" implies something covid. 94% refers something *at time death*, often times acquired disease ravaging body. Ditto, exactly T. I'm 45 miles south Madison, near Fib Border here.  Five bars, five churches, zero grocery store town. fucks care anything next beer. Dear god. article specifically suggests fact due covid-19. god. looking already 2/3rds deaths 1918 flu. might help tell story problems umbilical cords. 

When born found knot umbilical cord purple almost make it. one noticed knot mother, regular checkups great Drs. reason made mother planner induce labor day scheduled arrive. Unfortunately things get missed Drs things happen last second baby getting positioned arrive, mom said lots cartwheels must tied somehow. lucky, knot could easily killed waited natural birth. 

I'm sorry loss. American unlikely whatever might call yourself. Dude totally lying. He's likely shift leader Arby's. It‚Äôs hospitals cheap buying agreeing 5 year contracts American N95s. 


That‚Äôs there‚Äôs still supply shortage. US government won‚Äôt guarantee N95s orders pandemic with. Basically needs done using DPA guarantee 10 years N95.


They already using Defense Industrial Base, adding N95s won‚Äôt bankrupt government  Boom. Good due diligence. Thanks! this. feel like asshole kids less inclined steal whole bowl full bags vs whole bowl candy. I'm happy send random sample mask's I've received store linked QC check want. Spain France cases US per 100k last 14 data. Totally agree. way school morning, realized I'd left mask(I laundry)as soon started car. Even 50 degree weather, took key ignition went back get it. Luckily drove time. go back every time. ADE effect place opposite might true: reinfections could get worse, antibodies could help virus infect cells instead neutralising it.

To find would need antibody titres reinfected severe course shortly prior reinfection, find similarities or/and least study researching current antibody status reinfected behave presented SARS-CoV-2 virion. china sure bro. realize ccp bunch liars concentration camps. Also North Korea spends vast amounts money faking wealth tourists. wouldnt put past xinnie pooh fake flights country ravaged corona. Honestly there's billion people arent gonna notice 50 million died corona. Contact tracing early detection. things freedumbers don‚Äôt understand. politization medicine, I'm done them. Alex Azar controls statements FDA. [Putin's former media Michael Caputo was, recently controlling said CDC.     

They're done. started lying day one masks. government complains China lied virus. Well, 3 weeks.  We've ""downplaying"" thing start current day. thing masks - decided early February seek masks medical workers, could [change public discourage mask wearing get masks way. So, propensity lie malevolent intent - good ingredients get buy they're selling. links random deleted comment... I‚Äôm sure focused trying discredit me... could care less believe Dude keep making awesome content. I've shared tests conclusions TONS people. 

I agree KF94's much nicer. 

Again - keep kicking ass. I‚Äôve Target, Festival, Kwik Trip, Meijer, more. people incorrectly wearing masks all. 

Only place I‚Äôve never seen Costco. 

Appelton Green Bay Area ^ Right first months pandemic, small groups Asia Europe seemed getting reinfected.

They cautioned looks like immunity may there, immunity last long enough. also know getting reinfected different strain. simply done enough studies know sure, months, started look likely could rely immunity catching it.

The foolish hope getting infected would provide immunity. looks like case. either avoid infection wait vaccine, get infected, infected again. infection deadlier. think matters classify time periods, I'd concerned time period longer vaccine studied. r/covid19positive good source info. They‚Äôre testing ‚Äúhot spots‚Äù people considered high risk exposure daily lives. sleep next healthcare worker live apartment. 

Our city clocking almost 1,000 new cases per day months ago. 

I think circumstances close challenge trial they‚Äôre going able perform humans.  publish new results challenge tests performed little monkeys.  

Those showed vaccine extremely effective preventing infection subjects exposed large dose live virus.  It‚Äôs perfect, that‚Äôs they‚Äôve got now. People die. That's life even about. Pretty sure even talking thing.  comment section comment claim teacher. also comment claim married blind person.


could please provide details company's china factory? interested story. city? name factory? teach company? theory bullshitism? introduction delusion? agree conditions preexisting time infection reported separately CDC. example table comorbidities lists renal failure determination made preexisting caused infection. Someone chronic kidney disease listed row whose kidneys failed due covid reported contributing factor. Thanks Canada trying keep North America sane. Yes, that‚Äôs stopped spread infection. Extremely cruel, effective. holy sub reddit bro lmao False false. r/covid19positive I'm sorry loss. arguments still flu uncle died it? I'm genuinly trying understand line reasoning. see hope. researchers better chances. higher number ""breakthroughs"" come true breakthrough. kinda see numbers game.  or...you know...they could stop stamping KN95 products adhering KN95 standards??

I'm sure people would still bought day long even said KN70 (making number/name hypothetical). 

What find abhorrent labeling product something - especially health risk. 

But right - I'll pay higher price something comes Korea - I'm nearly concerned products counterfeit garbage. Btw, quick bit digging reveals 3 days ago u/sheuduehz teacher, really need spend time this?  That‚Äôs great hear. Sounds like much worse flu shot. 

Don‚Äôt get wrong, want thing work. requires trusting Big Pharma Government. Times India (TOI) Indian English-language daily newspaper digital news media owned managed Times Group. According Audit Bureau Circulations, ranked 9th world circulation 3rd India.[2][3][4][5][1][6] oldest English-language newspaper India, second-oldest Indian newspaper still circulation since first edition published could googled instead playing fake news card. cuz beat people spitting street. duh 


Because he's teacher post? schools factories China now? live Green Bay / Appleton area went get bread milk morning local Kwik Trip. counted morning people 4 12 store wearing mask. Lot talking masks hate tons people close other. I‚Äôm sure bill included internet access well possibly landline alarm monitoring. got second dose Pfizer vaccine candidate serious side effects. Muscle pain, fatigue, little bit nausea. gone within 48 hours dose. 
I‚Äôm concerned effective thing turns be. feel lot scientific breakthroughs, there‚Äôs one article posted never hear again. Hoping that‚Äôs case I'm glad masks way virus(ironically asthma certain perfumes, flowers cleaners make hard breath), companies they're getting gonna give shit quality masks. One professional basketball player one baseball player sent home year myocraditis caused covid. Thats doesnt happen wit flu. flu vaccine may typically 30% effective, important number reduces ICU admissions Covid ICU admissions 80% would go long way returning ""normal"". course! U cant scare people away going plane, going restaurants $$$ made.   /s that. live neighboring state. Apparently supreme court stated unlawful mandate use facemasks andas kids must go back school..... I'm curious- makes think he's making up? 
We know chinese news sources reputable. I'm curious confident he's making up? It‚Äôs like upstate NY least. Majority complying regulations everyone about. Everything amusement park, concert/show/sports venue, movie theater seems open. Malls open. really feel like everyone near adapted initial shock going life around restrictions. Yeah, that's covid right? Plenty viruses (which don‚Äôt lock for) wield long term side effects small percentage people. isn‚Äôt anything new, every single science brain looking exact time. Whereas nobody really bothered before. 

Also helps scare population following rules. Fuck xinnie pooh prefer vaccine hail mary. saying there's chance. /S ccp schill Well it‚Äôs difficult make projection three weeks out. we‚Äôre talking model that‚Äôs really inaccurate months out. course hope it‚Äôs wrong aren‚Äôt 3,500 deaths day Christmas. wear masks rest eternity? I‚Äôm Canadian say it‚Äôs 3/4 wearing masks. don‚Äôt know survey done, reality, states Canada probably similar percentages wearing masks.

Don‚Äôt believe everything see news, especially reddit. It‚Äôs mostly sensationalized headlines.

My part Canada mostly people wearing masks unless absolutely required. Even stores they‚Äôre mandatory in, people walk greeter remove mask. believe 87% may told polling person would call civic duty, experience says said look good. Can‚Äôt wait never hear reading article Even Texas Arizona purple days. NPI? Thank sharing. number people dying different zero something wrong needs addressed. Democrats january actually lol. Republican rioting anti cop crap came around. care buy. mean cant drink drive like 70s much freedoms nwo taking overrr aren‚Äôt worried dying. Oh wow took back. heart broke Sam episode even though guy wasn‚Äôt Jack bother engaging troll? detail prepared fabricated story generic ""factory"" already gave headache google actual province. Precursor store US. Sorry folks, it‚Äôs probably coming amount anti -mask protesting going prevent it. honorable state Wisconsin apologize Covid! going cluster fuck. school system look around see unending failure prevent exposure schools? Belgian teacher here. exactly same. Cases soaring 1100 average cases day, yet schools remain open nothing happening college kids going main cities like nothing going on.

Even better : ""government"" said bubble five people vanish use common sense.

Majority people proven cannot use common sense. going explode worst case scenario. big Trump rallies recently? know anecdotal case, confirmed Paris France. best friend, early thirties confirmed antibodies pcr March... bad end mildly ill (no hospitalization) quite debilitating lingering symptoms. Despite antibodies July. She‚Äôs sick week, partner confirmed positive recently lo behold antibodies again. says chest hurts burns LOT time seems fairly scared parents hurts constantly even test ü•∫ Kudos tapering &amp; keeping drinking low-key. ever want reduce more, there's wonderful kindness &amp; encouragement r/stopdrinking sub! least trump, clearly isnt taking covid seriously, know expect him.

boris johnson seems constantly switch laughing dangers COVID talking like COVID destroy world month. Name address factory. Surely reason hide right?



Right? 19. anyone really know it‚Äôs for?

^(/s) legit sad person, I'm assuming adult person, needs reminded this. 

RIP common sense Please post/comment music links. 


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  I‚Äôm one people trying suggest 10,000 people died covid. I‚Äôm trying say thing are. people follow usa news lol. Nov 4th earliest. then, government representation go one ear, other. trust process usually takes 5 years pumped 6 months. encourage people volunteer infected people without masks. I'm sorry loss. wife unexplained miscarriage 19 weeks first pregnancy still remember feeling whole world crashing doctor find heartbeat. years ago, since healthy child, still mourn loss memory flashes back time time still can't help think could been. imagine must went through/still going through.

Stay strong. Unfortunately that‚Äôs science - especially treatments. go much scrutiny stuff doesn‚Äôt hold up. KN95 seal problem well known back April? Also manufactured companies NMPA list hospitals duped WeChat scammers  bought KN95 masks medical supply city. hit miss quality good feel safe N95.
So wear cloth mask help fit. They‚Äôre huge women also help prolong life mask soon get home wash cloth mask hang KN95 air.
I would recommend KN95 alone don‚Äôt trust quality cloth mask think it‚Äôs best way go. Proud say currently studying Cornell, actually collaborated Prof Peter Frazier past (we department).

During summer led team built multiple epidemiological simulation models help school make data-driven decisions safely reopen. seeing good results rigorous scientific work they‚Äôve done. Huge props them! Yep, stores area require mask. lot masks pulled chin people inside. Even employees pulled nose &amp; managers care. must enforcement exhaustion &amp; kind empathize, still. So, gorilla mask I've wearing work actually anything? actually took time jobs organized level excellence 1st world countries. understand motivation is. catch 22 protect mask stockpiles healthcare workers case things got really nasty. knew would forced eat words eventually. Logically made sense paying since many people stupid incapable understanding this.  Yeah. said back August sports league would succeed would NFL. team mentality way teams travel road games would give advantage. soon agreed daily testing everyone, knew would work. like could still work US. 

If could buy 100 pack rapid tests home use, could test end every week flying back home work. wife could visit parents (all high risk). 

Maybe one day order rapid tests Amazon. course, still can‚Äôt buy fucking pack sanitizing wipes, guess I‚Äôm delusional. ""I thought hoax ..."" lot stuff like Spain.

Obesity likely major factor hits minorities harder. stats broken match pretty well countries, way high risk pregnancies raises overall rate.

STEM important produce kinds scientific based occupations. might need hours taught. change switch traching methods. children learn way. scientific experiments really early pre-school lower grades. exercises excite childrens curiosity. Children curious nature many teacher killed curiosity. 

I exciting STEM lectures exercises experiments equal measures let children explore science let learn science. 

For happen need change education teachers, share exciting lessons experiments. 
Encourage children curious science STEM. Give children chance explore books, apps, films, experiments. Schools could give lists good apps, books subjects people changed science like Marie Curie, Nicola Tesla say Albert Einstein Leonardo Da Vinci. 

Teachers work across subjects several subjects round person let children teachers explore 

How exchange lessons, lectures, experiments exercises?

Zzzzzzz necessarily. fully functioning test trace system large minority care put people risk large, would position infections rising point appears control. So, aim lock would resolve two issues period would last could weeks time 'round (what commentators terming 'emergency break').

People weigh costs pandemic allow remain control. impact lives, economy/jobs/livelihoods, social community organisations rely attendance, events charity lost forever, disabled rely care workers visit homes help live fully functioning life (clearly many infections means enough care workers help them), impact schools/children countless people significantly impacted this. Broadly, pandemic left partially unhindered capacity set country back decades.

It's either/or situation sense economy versus jobs. going vaccine good (at best), can't shut country long periods, able live deal better way could well lock weeks giving government valuable time get test trace system sorted virus completely control (which would turn render best test trace system world pretty much useless). Well, often mutations, normally occur sequences irrelevant immunity. mutations found would rende existing immunity ineffective. 

It likely either antibodies proper T-cell response maybe B-memory cells able memorize, thus mounting quick AB response

or

They remaining antibodies neutralize virus instead helping infect cells (called ADE, like dengue fever different strains reinfect ABs prior strain help new strain infecting body seriously).

I like scenarios still hope, stay isolated cases... know, Sweden... weird covid affect religions. one side, suffering draw faith science, also increase suffering.

Millions Americans infected February, March April - 3 month immunity protection - would seeing cases re-infection right now. 

I argue re-infection occurring minute occurrance. But, not...then sense worrying virus go live life. literally nothing it. Vaccine provide minimal protection. vaccine would great time bar Vegas

Ah make sense. :) think true many cases. know ones say symptoms back March get test took antibody test came positive. And, tested COVID.

Some re-infections though good case could made cross-contamination specimens especially different strains. something like 50 million lab tested confirmed cases excess billion tests given. absolutely going cross-contamination point wherein someone tested ""positive"" it. know one re-infections within 6 weeks other. raises eyebrows view.

This say re-infection can't occur. likely likely majority already recovered likely nothing even. saw another thread copying think good way explaining immunity.

Immunity continuum. Think copying page book giant library.

If zero immunity, look book haystack, bring copier, find right page, print page.

If full immunity (antibodies), book already preloaded copier. End result, infection stamped lightning quick.

If COVID-19 T-cells, book sitting table bookmark waiting copied. End result, infection fought hours day so.

If reactive T-cells (say) common cold, books sitting nearby similar. End result, infection much milder maybe won‚Äôt experience symptoms.

People moving goalposts immunity mean something like ‚ÄúCOVID-19 cannot enter body.‚Äù Looks like Faux News strikes again. swear channel poison. Yeah I'm talking 14 people grocery store. 

There's many people picture either sea probably bad word. It‚Äôs difficult get lot folks coming poorly educated follow pre natal regimens. Add drug use, abusive homes end higher rates. We've got overprocessed food pumped full hormones served gigantic portions. We've got stress anxiety tied long works weeks amount money earned still pay rent. We've got depression mental health issues treat swallowing pill pill pill. We've got many roads many cars, causing much pollution, sidewalks businesses places interest spread far apart walk to.

The healthcare needs end doctors needs start working issues. 27 weeks pregnant today. fewer screenings time first pregnancy, screenings mostly reassurance. really much find something wrong one them. (I‚Äôm saying lived experience well reading every possible scientific article could topic, three pregnancy losses prior pregnancy found ultrasounds 5, 8 11 weeks). many countries cited pregnancy outcomes better, waiting 12 weeks standard women often receive two ultrasounds total unless issue later pregnancy. (Monitoring later pregnancy impactful, earlier monitoring less so.) Again, justifying projections aren‚Äôt measurements.

You really don‚Äôt seem grok that.

I‚Äôm well aware effects IFR, nothing said makes .3 correct I'm wrong though..


Yes, wrong assume shit justify projected infection rates aren‚Äôt even based seroprevalence studies.

Feel free keep assuming want true.

Anti-maskers whole lot uglier scarier Halloween monster considered kids going back school, there's also lot restrictions there, too. Quite lot places online/virtual learning only, though kids going school person, masked days, faculty. 

Which might true throughout country. know different areas handling it, know places least *some* things normally even consider standard flu season. Combined large volume distance learning overall restrictions general (even followed closely be), we're still looking easiest flu season modern history. Maybe quite flatline happened places (or likely happen places strong restrictions, like Scotland), still light flu season. Or, least, deluge death people seem think is.

If mass deaths fall/winter, likely us slacking containing Covid, due large surge flu. understandable nice day Others countries succeeding average smarter usually less educated. order masks work, wear correctly. Masks currently mandatory country buildings public transport, like cops patrolling everywhere forcing people wear them. people wear sort mask, can't count many cover nose, mouth, periodically push mask aside heated conversation starts feeling uncomfortable. *nobody* know carries hand sanitiser disinfect hands taking mask putting on, except me. People keep reusing disposable surgical masks ages shoving bags loose, right next phone wallet, etc.

Yet still nearly many cases fucks general population gives, appears even bare minimum actually work. That's too. I've felt totally helpless.

This cannot right, something wrong study. Thank you, tracker useful.

It makes curious time interval reinfected patients short, 50-60 days less. Maybe immune system incapable generating sufficient response all? common we‚Äôd thousands confirmed cases re-infection now, even considering factors listed. Millions infected, 11 confirmed re-infected six months. Even we‚Äôve caught 1 every 1000 cases re-infection, numbers negligible. obviously *can* happen, like get struck lightning (about 50 people U.S. died lightning strikes last year). don‚Äôt plan lives around avoiding lightning strikes, shouldn‚Äôt plan future around idea COVID going keep re-infecting people die.

Ok, doesn‚Äôt change things aren‚Äôt everyone Something like 50% Americans can't afford $400 unexpected bill emergency. mom supposed work 2 weeks start road completely broke/homeless??  us planning always wear masks long virus threat.

I think big deal wear mask. tiny, trivial little thing. people gladly forever. people (we call people ""assholes"") refuse all. high school photo. 

I grew still live community. reflections happening here.

1.	In cases believe parents sick kids making tough choice lying schools saving face work even getting work done. Even without COVID, wife constantly battling work make time kids get sick. see people, point year, don‚Äôt much PTO left potentially can‚Äôt miss much work. Sending sick kids school wrong, employers country shit comes kids. Two weeks ago, son low fever cough. immediately got tested kept home. time away work stressful getting test sucked. fine (minor cold), see lot working parents wanting take time kid ‚Äúnot sick enough stay home‚Äù. Sadly, thing working parents say. 
2.	A lot people community upper level managers, CEOs, lawyers, doctors, high-powered executive types. wealthy community. Think four country clubs one city. people always think know better schools best thing is. Furthermore, people (even homes one person provides income) accustomed giving lives take care children. busy social schedules!! know worst behavior is? prestigious private school city!!
3.	This also conservative community huge Trump signs everywhere (though generation (&lt;40, married, kids) much liberal. County wide, you‚Äôre liberal, don‚Äôt want get stuck talking politics. Plenty neighbors weird COVID downplayers deniers.
4.	The community super judgy gossipy. people would rather send COVID infected kid school people gossip them. Seriously. seen firsthand. family know totally treated like pariahs unknowingly hung someone unknowingly exposed. friends everything right still people super passive aggressive talked behind backs.  Mix 4 parts mayo 2 part ketchup 1 part mustard, add onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, add vinegar needed balance

Make batch buns (king arthur flour great recipe soft burger buns), make 2"" tall rings 4"" wide aluminum foil. Use foil guide burger buns bake taller, use bit extra dough recipe states. Slice bun 3 parts bread knife.

Heat cast iron skillet medium heat. Take ground chuck, least 80/20, work meat, mean really squish around, want opposite would normally handle burger patty. Get pretty dense. Pop meatball skillet weigh spatula 1/2"" thin. see juices come flip brown side.

Dice lettuce (iceberg, anything close stem types) onion fine manage. Layer bottom bun, sauce, onion, lettuce, American cheese slice, hot patty, middle bun, sauce, onion, lettuce, pickles, another patty, top bun.

If want fries, like 2 cups oil 10"" cast iron pan. Slice potato 1/4"" thin. Nuke microwave minutes (they get hot), chill freeze, hot oil done, remove salt. want go there's article Kenji Serious Eats details boiling water bit vinegar frying.

There it, DIY big mac fries home relatively little effort (at least much made burger fries normally). Big macs favorite taste like kid remembers, way salty, figured make home. simiar processes McDonalds items like quarter pounder double cheeseburgers. American cheese must either way. national feeling solidarity cohesion help. impressive level pessimism. Like, legitimately impressive. 31 million confirmed cases, untold number unconfirmed cases, *11* reinfections. holding onto fear. Very, impressive. Rand Paul‚Äôs data cherry picked continues parade Sweden success story. Sweden 5x death rate per capita neighbors Denmark Norway have. Also, Swedens GDP dropped sharply neighbors. highschooler, see why. Missing even single day school (traditional online) create hell student since make missed homework schoolwork time.

I imagine article probably referring elementary middle school, even so, think problem school system putting much pressure parents. That's shame. Dads must take 3 months days. cannot taken mother. R0 Covid, especially since know fully airborne now?

Unchanged, since R0 calculated based observed spread disease. still estimated around 3. huge trials costs lot money, platform vaccine developed past ( took many many years ). mandates, laws rules pandemic. 

People can't use good judgment reason own.

Sad really. Grow think others.  duuuuuuuhhhhhh

Anyone surprised sign seminar moon real estate. upvoted this, realized doesn‚Äôt matter (or me, world really - it‚Äôs arbitrary action serves meaningful purpose, imo). I‚Äôm at, send home two weeks... well rest class. took option online. It‚Äôs lot work, it‚Äôs like really go back work knowing there‚Äôs high probability would randomly take work weeks time. realize extremely lucky option though, since don‚Äôt luxury. gonna scraping while, manage. Wut?

So, totally wrong one. comment insane. mention death rate extremely low. Correction, long been. Thank pointing error. Please explain First say Socialism anything it, say socialized profits state-owned oil companies, economy tanked oil price did. words, socialism played role. think depends job offer here. source probably meme shared boomer facebook Daily deaths slowly going right now. Rand Paul smarmy wrong time. What's new. Yes. Anecdotal evidence allowed.  Iirc New York City COVID antibody tests showed atleast 1/4 people infected non-goalpost-moving metric. multiple decades teaching adults show even sick, punishing people calling sick, anyone surprised sending kids school, sick? Publish damn data.  dont work home. 

Popping teleconference wearing gorilla mask great coworker morale, especially gorilla things well. enough time could eventually outsource job actual gorilla watch Netflix day cost broken keyboards bananas per day. Back March April doctor Kiryas Joel touting hydroxychloroquine miracle solution like Trump, saying using cure patients (Hasidim). I‚Äôm sure happened guy news isn‚Äôt surprising given insular nature. Believe could snap fingers rid jim justice, would it‚Äôs complicated situation. one ignorant comment dude. Jesus fucking Christ. He's ""listen."" Paul's reason taking Fauci soundbytes. I'm sure heard every word says (possibly) agrees it. However, Paul knows base filled anti-intellectual people think know better ""*scientists*"" *college degrees*. Damn. male, get essentially 0 job, here. Fathers basically even considered parental leave country (for jobs, -- places offer it, minority). That's great opportunity. live county UW. rates skyrocking last couple weeks 75%-ish (it's varied little right around percentage) UW staff students. Corona, threw back could stand bent 40 degrees. still work delivering pizza. job puking shift door driving threatened job give 24 hrs notice food poisoning. 

I'm currently job best sick insurance benefits anyone know, adult family members included even sick, COVID otherwise, fully expected somehow hit service hours face face appointments month, risk write ups don't. true all. can‚Äôt live Canada rn all. One death wasn‚Äôt nursing home. sick mom, still work despite mild symptoms employer asshole, leave kids home alone. sends school either get fired cause means even able collect unemployment.

The incentives society aligned right thing. individual responsible choices, plutocratic government fault giving shitty options choose from. Wonder long symptomatic?  Hope gets well soon. know, anti-science community, high school drop-out's fart logic treated legit scientific conclusions. Definitely owners management...but staff choice follow herd management says want food table. political gain, public safety restoring economy.

Plenty Americans board idea, bad not. like this. want socialism. want unchecked capitalism. want regulated capitalism strong environmental consumer protections strong social safety nets. would hope matter willful ignorance instead merely economic desperation. Either possibility sad. otherwise wholeheartedly agrees Collaredzeus' point be.. Trump‚Äôs America so, no. Many departments claim benefits etc. good apps. Sweden perfect though, certainly flaws countries. he's fraud too, got see.. LAs pretty common body though, developing something specifically targets ones covid might off. No, believe assume 21 days something die, longer DISCLAIMER: County estimates sum statewide estimated patients recovered posted website, statewide total estimates number recovered counties current day. statewide estimate, following method used:

* 1. Include total confirmed cases (as posted DSHS COVID-19 Public Dashboard: 2. Remove deaths
* 3. Estimate ~20% remaining/living cases required hospitalization ~80% remaining/living cases not
* 4. Estimate recovery time hospitalized patients ~32 days, recovery time non-hospitalized patients ~14  ex works school. takes two cases room around time anything now. They‚Äôve four school two weeks ago none kids classes shut down. Also one kids infected sibling showed school next two days realized sent home.  Thats corporate socialism you, wanna take leave employer put leave ever unions protecting you. Kids wonderful. I'd favor greater social services support first child anyone wanted one. could reduce population pressure also providing support children Another reason would great Johnson &amp; Johnson one-dose vaccine goes proves efficacious rest. 

Otherwise, doses month apart, two weeks takes effect. would prefer people spoke honestly treated. deadbeats pandemic, soon gears start jam get PR spin important are. people think neighbor kicked ass leaving waste products curb, actually kicked ass waste product. first hand experience isn‚Äôt allowed? interesting. thanks info companies tread extremely cautiously employee utilizing FMLA/Workers Comp, etc. massive legal troubles appears fired worker legitimately using one types programs. may try make job miserable push quitting, however. information post-birth effects, considering news cardiovascular effects asymptomatic people? assume enough time study it. believe anything consistently go whoever talked last?  mean that's quite diverse set characters there.  

And really can't imagine anyone would want current anti-science bent continue.  reason many Americans dead directly political meddling towards scientists, Well US people church bring casseroles dinner start prayer chain. help one bit rent bills somehow still think social welfare private enterprise public one. [U.S. coronavirus toll passes 

Just saw brief report CBS. completely astonished comment sections. People overwhelmingly claim number lie, government manipulating number (to exaggerate, downplay).

Someone said nobody his/her village getting coronavirus, must lie.

I like WTF. convey seriousness pandemic? 200,000 people enough fill several Super Bowl stadiums! 

Enough internet today‚Ä¶ feel hopeless angry. Many died result something people like never want bring this. Many died quarantine, went bars, rallies, etc., refused wear masks. mean famous people died way, Herman Cain one example. 

America destined struggle day 1, president embrace precautionary measures far late, also inherent American culture please. people died choosing wanted face evidence reconsider.

There one blame them. general consensus reddit like fact downvote oblivion, works every /r section, every section triggered particular set facts. awful. hope gets therapy deal him. People like also use children pawns manipulate people around child one suffers most. Makes blood boil. fact reinfection symptoms serious individual *not good.* limited ways happen none good. follow tweet, track 15 documented reinfections 2 reinfections milder symptoms. Eight severe, 3 same, 2 symptom data.

Hopefully reporting bias catching asymptomatic reinfections, data ideal. College student really sucks, like first semester campus, Literally year would campus right now, dorm, meeting new friends, fun, probably getting drunk nights, I'm stuck home taking online classes. hope god next semester go back campus, fall 2021 go completely back normal, partying, 0 masks, etc vaccine widely available then. Wow, far happens U.S. I'm amazed. Government websites notorious working properly there's nothing ""instant"" here. Imagining able claim something app done pipe dream. too.

Me docter. Senator Paul - ""A candle wind"" Standing Alone album 2020. USA mentality. really thinking moving another Country . USA.... Fl would take convince statistically significant reinfection occurring? proof something obtained obtainable? V√§lkommen! :) Good point. Socialism didn‚Äôt destroy Venezuela, US sanctions oil weakness often articles exclaiming hoe moon full every month? Yay. Thanks China! lack sports that. That‚Äôs sports ratings still low. putting taking Halloween key takeaway article ""Most guests wear masks got Covid19, restaurant staff wearing masks infected."" What‚Äôs 3% based off? Republican anti mask state? Really? Huh. don‚Äôt understand happen...they told must umbilical cord don‚Äôt know that. appointment days bit hard time finding heartbeat rushed appointment different doctor usually saw. also state insurance feel receive adequate care it. Something happened never got answers received. Every time see news like OP makes resentful country (US). I‚Äôm fed fucking stupid people are.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* ""It's virtually affected nobody."" I'm sure graphs exist. Republican anti mask state? Really? Hmm. Yes, decide path life. I'm asking nicely. Thank you! sounds awesome! Take care :) üèÜ#1 IP ban That's minimum want. hopefully highly effective non seniors. FDA won‚Äôt approve anything less 50% effectiveness, stated this. Facebook control disinformation conspiracy theories. becoming complete digital shit hole. way, article opening colleges caused 3,000 cases per day article college neighborhood become hotspot Rhode Island‚Äôs cases. 

So know, fuck you. country South America really lockdown like NZ Europe. Forget it. People didn‚Äôt follow rules. case Brazil, neither president. I‚Äôm sure calculations fine. I‚Äôm worried unforeseen side effects may manifest outside trial horizon, I‚Äôm also concerned anticipated results group adequately diverse WRT M/F, young/old, white/minority, thin/obese variety medical conditions. That‚Äôs lot cram group 150.  Dude know many things people kill people every day, anwyay? Driving cars, skydiving, etc.? flu season? Nobody virtue signaling previous flu seasons, even serious ones like 2017-18 ""stay home, MAY flu asymptomatically maybe cough could give flu someone who's old die it."" argument ""well flu vaccine kill many people, where's line drawn? really think people continue protective crap vaccine out? No. continue virtue signal reddit average person certainly give crap vaccine out, regardless country they're in. 

And talking me? wear masks required. I'm allowed like them. doubt people real world (meaning non redditors) enjoy would think they're worth wearing time actively aware they're sick.  sorry lost son. thing happened me. nearly 37 weeks healthy fine wasn‚Äôt. Also risk factors healthy pregnancy, yet still stillborn. never got answers, either. would 10 month. I'd even take step say Cornell saved lives opening. main tenant official answer reopened I'm actually buying it. Here's logic: 
Lots students live campus leases can't break, they'll back town anyway. campus open/classes held, students tested twice weekly quarantined sick. campus open, students either Ithaca tested/monitored home areas likely dangerous (COVID wise). know Cornell Ithaca, Ny small city approximately ~30k full time residents (the surrounding county, Tompkins, ~100k residents). Cornell ~24k students Ithaca, city's population almost doubles students town. worth, Ithaca done quite well COVID, local hospital quite small (there reasonable number much larger hospitals within 90 minutes larger cities Syracuse, Rochester Binghamton). uncontrolled outbreak started students would really problematic area.  
 top Cornell employs ~10k faculty staff, say major local employer understatement. Largest employer Tompkins County residents residents several neighboring counties. Everyone area connection Cornell employee. faculty/staff working campus also tested least weekly.   
 means Cornell took open, specifically conducting 30k tests per week, local area one tested populations US, world. Since positivity rate Cornell's testing currently 0.02%, I'd say quite well really trickles local population (again everyone knows someone works Cornell, local COVID cases caught).  Students also deserve lot credit, taking quite seriously, wearing masks TIME (even outside) small scare early semester kept partying minimum. culture ""let's make work screw things up"".  
 
 Students also driver local economy. Ithaca's mayor said several times spring much trouble city would students return. Like not, economic hardship cost lives well. Luckily local restaurants, shops, etc core customers back able tweak business model survive physically distanced setting.
 
 TLDR: possible colleges reopen without causing deaths, done right lives even saved. Welp I've seen vancouver headline missing word think. Stockholm ""infection control physician' (is correct word?) warning increase number infected.. 1.3% positive cpr tests week last week, 2.2% last week.
This far over. think government faking positive tests? trying relate fact April tests reported, one it? Quit mincing words. It‚Äôs unfortunate. It‚Äôs political party spreading deadly propaganda resulting thousands thousands unnecessary deaths. sick people calling spade spade. agree that. lived Merseyside unfortunately want blame everything government. government fucked ones spreading covid. mates said fuck it, open everything life must go on, can't stay socially distanced ever.

It's shame UK decided open stuff back decision caused massive second wave. Also think shut again, going try socially distancing whilst keeping everything open.  TCM reason still cable. I'd gladly give ESPN lower bill. wife currently 13 weeks pregnant, things currently healthy going way be. 

This terrifies me. know we'd happened us. I'm sorry article say **states compiling data themselves?**

Oh, wait, didn't! state live in? I'll give link states repository NOTHING federal government.

You obviously paying attention, terrible reading, since made point clear *and gave fucking source.* Many can‚Äôt call sick don‚Äôt sick days. That‚Äôs considered benefit half country doesn‚Äôt get those. call sick get fired. parents incentivized go work sick send kids school sick. Par course Don‚Äôt forget unhealthy. type full lockdown you‚Äôre talking never going happen wouldnt legal arguing waste time. Public health works. It‚Äôs like (public health practitioners) haven‚Äôt saying years. quite frustrating work people ‚Äúconvinced‚Äù centuries-old public health measures work. Every damn time cases go up, trolls come proclaim disease longer deadly casedemic. Every damn time they're wrong. Plenty studies linked red meat inflammation, PubMed results 190 regards carbs, processed carbs opposed whole grain associated inflammation. There's probably lot red tape create/get (i.e. legal protection administrators / 'sign risk' language), yeah, take *3 months*...? common ... yeah, many modern countries sensible sick leave rules public health services. Fauci deal much shit year, gotta give resilient Got get perfect attendance award. hhmmmm....I wonder helps deeply polarizing leader frames masks restrictions freedom-robbing oppressions questions statements even government's health officials... 100%. infection rates low (at 1% below, sure), kids school. waiting zero new cases? probably going see lifetime, even vaccine. thought idea crush curve, wait cases anywhere. really pro- anti-mask. theory work, sure. want belong camps, let clear that. Anyway, implementing different strategies right time time keeping sustainable approach.

If we're able keep deaths, hospitalizations overall infections down, like we've managed recently, FHM see fit introduce new changes sake it. standby said multiple times may consider recommendations places distance can't kept, like public transport. 

I think there's chance we'll see regional recommendations soon, we'll wait see. ‚ÄúIf aren‚Äôt dying covid, fuck you‚Äù

was exactly approach everyone took surprised? stop spreading misinformation. Wear mask social distance. know bettee science. I've lost ppl virus, joke. one paying student loans right Ow. made knee got stitches hurt. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Virtue signaling more: look good person am. Less a: guys role models let‚Äôs make set example. 

Normalizing making cool vote, example. Even live California, isn‚Äôt virtue signaling. 

That‚Äôs take, support current weak enforcement policy mask mandate across major sports. It‚Äôs making sports guys seem better really are, it‚Äôs encouraging fans better. 

I pre existing condition treatment plan altered pandemic I‚Äôm sensitive this. wear damn mask don‚Äôt make big deal it, got shit do! health insurance considered excellent well. kid we'd basically pay $0 pocket. infertility treatment hand... :( Could both

Not sure I‚Äôm downvoted suggesting something scientific papers published would nice registered doctor could simple checkups, administer meds. Good whaaaaaaaaaaaat? could predicted that? **Please note - questions answered here. Please go AMA thread /r/askscience. Thanks!** Great move. likely get sicker get sicker, young. It'd take bad luck get really bad case age (which happen, small likelihood). This.  Man 25mbps scam, hell spend 5 extra bux get quadruple speed? Ask teacher would called weeks ago smh Southern states..... accent misleading all. exactly like sound Hey Dan, I'm sorry smart-ass causing unnecessary confusion.

I hoping people looked extensive amount data, like have, could communicate put understanding data work solve crisis national level called upon.

The US extremely divided approach tackling roller coaster problem resulted much misinformation county, state, etc. Eight months crisis we're still seeing unbelievable resistance fighting virus every level.

Anyways, keep good work thanks sharing! Fuck off, loser. Americans stupid. push back rights violated.

In every country could forcibly vaccinate shitters like cattle. personally wouldn't, known exposure. knows even it.

I probably would put visiting 94-year-old granddad nursing home couple weeks, would otherwise go normal (which means grocery shopping weekly point). bad could facemasks do? Ebola virus named geographical origin one seems care. There's less two million cases globally? Paid personal emergency leave.

Ontario 2 paid PEL days per year. Ford government scrapped it.

*Sigh* Oh, super obvious thing anyone brain head predicted happen actually happened?


#Say ain't so!!!! Agreed. NEED universal healthcare. without it, think America going bright future. Especially long term effects coronavirus.

For every one American dies, least another one lifelong health effects. Probably more. And, maybe end coming fruition soon enough help COVID techniques analysis might suitable something future.

For example: least one new techniques used deliver COVID vaccine unprecedented schedule first attempted SARS went away vaccine could get trials. Lol, Florida, West Virginia, Iowa. completely predictable. Personally hope employee sues harassment voyeurism something. way ‚Äúcaught glimpse‚Äù damn stall door crack. Normal people would looking anywhere *but* restroom. That's get super-low property taxes. people Florida, pay state income tax love show off. pandemic hits everyone like ""WTF state pays $200 week unemployment takes 8 weeks get approved!!"" Real smart.

A huge chunk country thinks personal liberty means zero responsibility, sad. important aspect consider reinfection happening *at all*. point, know ultra rare occurrence, cases could first outliers something closer 5 6 month immunity cycle. choice anti-healthcare arguments socialized medicine critics:

* expensive work
* People come US medical care (premise health care GOOD US)
* want pay people's healthcare
* Going road socialized medicine means there's road back current system like
* sort weird morality justification tune morally right force people pay others malfeasance bodies.

I find even hypocritical arguments put forth pro-lifers. signs possibly *always* there, FWIW... must continue remote learning, whenever possible! Yep, work school Florida two sick kids sent school first day üôÑ. Fewer. Yep. school nurse wasn‚Äôt allowed give medication. Regardless records indicated needed not. 

For instance, record stated allowed ibuprofen menstrual cramps, cramps debilitating would pass out. Started cramping really bad went nurse medication. wouldn‚Äôt give said couldn‚Äôt legally give medication. call mom leave grocery store, middle grocery shopping, drive way school give two ibuprofens. stay lobby secretary assistant principal watch take verify took medication. two ibuprofen get counter...

It‚Äôs ridiculous really saying this. matter dies. Right young old. Children, babies, middle age, teens, young adults, elderly. died dying. bit research you? could [employed comprehensive containment effort early [smartly maintained policies areas relaxing need arose. almost like shit together something. No, total number stillbirths in-depth study (Nepal), remained pre-pandemic level total number hospital births half, rate increased. births home ""smaller facilities"" study track them. Pfizer's vaccine also RNA vaccine, may greater hurdles FDA approval. far know, RNA vaccines previously approved use humans. J&amp;J's vaccine conventional approach (recombinant adenovirus), used develop approved ebola &amp; zika vaccines. [You obviously paying Yep, investigated kids forcibly removed. 

THIS VIRUS LIKE AIRBORNE AIDS, AIR ENTERS SKULL MELTS BRAIN!! No. every school nurse. recent history CDC gold standard, no? Current public health guidance relating quarantine relies fact immunity lasts least 3 months think worst citizens loud country though. think problem media tends focus America's worst and, countries, seem much.

It really feels like pushing anti-American agenda times. exactly wrong stories about, selective way looks America bad. cited burea labor statistics. google search find different one. 

You want lie. Yep digging graves deeper putting debt! That‚Äôll show poor! Live posted odd comparison. point making?  Incorrect lol. Italy extremely high Sweden high well. Someone work going cruise, he‚Äôs WI. fudge goes cruise time like this? thing measles. They're anti-vaxxers well. Personally would support suing paranoid ass voyeurism US citizens sue US federal government pandemic response? so, think time someone starts putting case together. hope multiplication table game point. Ok. Great. That's exactly state country make sure happen.

Here Switzerland, employee call sick whenever they're sick. employer pay first days sick leave, mandatory employer's insurance takes over. can't reason firing them. mandated law parents take sick leave children sick nobody could care them, too.

Oh, due minimal wage laws, families forced parents working first place.

Some bits social capitalism make lot sense. Oh get it. Anything makes lockdowns look bad considered ""high quality information"", okay pal. I'm Dallas mask compliance high here. People happy it, businesses seem good job keeping people check. Covid survivors Covid tested West LA super easy going drive-through! Tested 2PM yesterday, got results morning; entailed coughing times swabbing mouth 20 seconds. come Sweden called Swedish virus nobody would‚Äôve given fuck. hand wringing pearl clutching CCP hilarious reddit Yeah thoughts. issue kids going school sick complex one, something many low wage families already faced point covid. undoubtably many people don‚Äôt care, despite resources right thing, everyone boat. 

Be mad lack sick leave shit wages prevent many families staying home sick kids, parents feel choice. Excellent response. let's fine poor people?  Schools also soup kitchens. society decide going ignore livable wage gap much society going let schools start feeding kids many parents longer afford to? nerve accuse schools shitty. Maybe lift burden let get back education, raising kids us. /rant actually funny Spanish flu come Spain. first country admitted infections, rest world hiding fact due war. that's 3 years younger Trump, that's median age

It means half deaths people older 71, way based data May. % deaths almost certainly WAY now. drop line 60-65, talking 90+%. 71 year olds daily swims walks either. obese comorbidities. age 71 obviously still contribute society

The point that, harsh sounding, people dying overwhelmingly close end average lifespan. widespread shutting everything comical overreaction. correct course was, is, quarantine pre-existing condition elderly population. reason cancel Trick Treat, peewee football youth soccer. stupid nobody risk.

Your response likely ""what old people kids come contact with!""

Key takeaway study, ""Our result indicates higher lower climate temperature prevent delay spread death rates shows significant positive impacts recovery rates COVID-19 patients. Thus, indicates climate temperature unlikely impose strict limit spread COVID-19. correlation cases death rates, indicator particular temperature range closely associated faster slower death rate COVID-19 patients."" short, there's evidence temperature plays role spread death rates. question turn new knowledge virus

""druggable""

this helpful, yet. 

off top todo list:

do *a drug* might fit there?

does fit?

how well fit?

does stop virus?

does side effects?

are side effects bad?

can minimize side effects?

can make it?

can make cheaply?

can make scale?

can formulate people?

does last shelf?

are patent issues?

does company drug now, one made way here, sit company management smart enough selfless enough take path IP rights leads people actually getting treated?

etc etc etc

in pharma people call results ""druggable"" sites ""targets"", mostly valuable. lots targets. show us convincing animal studies near zero tox screens high efficacy applying already-approved, off-label drug already production, let's get really excited!

not saying result useful. useful, interesting. LONG way ""stop virus tracks"" coronaviruses SARS2-COVID19. Yes but, totally came bats pangolins weirdos mixing genes together lab. yeah spiking glad It‚Äôs kids‚Äôs sports. He‚Äôs getting lot pressure counties go remote can‚Äôt sports. ""The hoping able vaccinate 20% world end 2021, that‚Äôs already quite ambitious""

That sound encouraging all. 

A vaccine often 60% effective, 60% 20% 12% people immune. Hardly makes difference current situation.

This depressing. least another year half isolation.

If done initial lockdown properly... stuff someone tells too. thinking skills own? Valerie* person lost weight pandemic? That‚Äôs thought reading another article reinfections worse second time around, everyone basically saying reinfection bound happen everyone. It‚Äôs really difficult understand immunity plays role there‚Äôs many conflicting things people saying. One one hand, scientists believe T-cells protect us long-term people Sars-1 T-cell memory 17 years post-infection. other, seems immunity lasts 6 months thats many people getting reinfected now? Secondary schools open. words flokimmunitet explicitly mentioned. Life Sweden ""back normal"". social distanced far far Americans. one wants tell that. It‚Äôs sports. People furious state kids can‚Äôt play sports schools go remote. even big rally WV capital kids parents came state protest seemed centered around sports. kids around state (some heavily infected counties) capital intermingling, hugging one another, going eat together, chanting, wearing masks, etc. WV vulnerable population comes Covid. Lots elderly overweight people. people last 6 months, causing increase now.

The sapike protests. Swedish Defence Brigade active again. kind tough avoid especially third world countries everyone internet access, elementary schools human interaction really important.

It really puts strain teachers example country clases 2 3 shifts schools arent big enough meet covid standarts, Riots? I‚Äôm pro vaccine potential effective anti viral medicine well that‚Äôs brilliant news. really screwed reagents tests beginning.

I'm sure he'll survive though! Stop posting day. Take break. Chill out. Relax. isnt 1000s die per day, dying. Clearly based IFR death counts age protecting nursing homes. spend effort protecting population dying vs others Holiday weekend. last many months. always increases holidays end. policies ever changed.

Japan, culturally, buying ""casedemic"" ideology. They're ""moving on"". Buckle winter. Ah ok. sure policy was. center shut due enough kids open. reopened enough kids bring everyone back right away. I'm sure policy changed temporarily regarding sickness soon could attend fever. guess prooves then. herd immunity strategy.

Since universities high schools closed. problem ... oh much health care system. many people. 

oddly nasa world health org's came conclusion overall human race. simple amount people support it. goes space travel. going lean hard A.I competes it. causing massive spike Wisconsin? 

The protesters/rioters. considered torture. Wtf. I'm sorry wife, you. Sanitiser dehydrating Poor health mother pregnancy, tobacco use pregnancy, inconsistent high risk post natal care definitely indicative larger systemic problems US, grouped concept Social Determinates Health. quick Google brought quote Kaiser Family Foundation

""Social determinants health conditions people born, grow, live, work age. include factors like socioeconomic status, education, neighborhood physical environment, employment, social support networks, well access health care""

In order improve infant mortality rates address larger system play, think saying.

One thing thought Interesting said ""electively shorting pregnancies"" reference scheduled C sections? work health care clinic low income pregnant women children God damn I've never seen many unnecessary C sections life. One baby delivered 2 weeks early ""the doctor going vacation wanted come get hand""  didnt tell us too, asked us again. Meaning employers allow happen. Second lockdown well underway teach trust healthcare providers. potentially put lesser skilled people position feel comfortable. get grip Nordic country. Dictors blame!
We believe strongly giving birth sickness, se midwifes helping natural part live. Midwifes Well educated highly respected. soon introduce doctor, risk giving drugs, maling birth forced ultimativt Ending cesarean section goes multible times! Increasing risk increases still birth. fact Spain didnt beat crush anything. delayed hit. time prepare second wave almost nothing cry pray magical vaccine solves problems.

We kinda thing France, except government said repeatedly another lockdown... bet local soft lockdowns, unfortunately. safe BLM riot, safe take kids outside around neighborhood. lower bound estimated IFR 0.3%
 
if remember correctly Iceland's seroprevalence study also suggest that.. Maybe read effective therapy confirmed clinical experience colleagues field impressive results. contrasts sharply theoretical criticism (insufficient substantiation double-blind studies) countries (e.g. Netherlands) even led ban therapy. meta-analysis Lancet, could demonstrate effect HCQ, withdrawn. primary data sources used proved unreliable 2 3 authors conflict interest. However, guidelines based study remained unchanged ‚Ä¶ 48 49
We serious questions state affairs.
In US, group doctors field, see patients daily basis, united ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Frontline Doctors‚Äù gave press conference watched millions times.21 51
French Prof Didier Raoult Institut d‚ÄôInfectiologie de Marseille (IHU) also presented promising combination therapy early April. Dutch GP Rob Elens, cured many patients practice HCQ zinc, called colleagues petition freedom therapy.22
The definitive evidence comes epidemiological follow-up Switzerland: mortality rates compared without therapy.23

Why lose you? trust research? side effects, drug safety, actually group 22.000, namely people got vaccine. 150 people ist ones also got disease. (of obviously come placebo group, otherwise vaccine working) hope pregnancy appointments covered! Covered California (Obamacare/Affordable Care Act) get birth control covered, OB/Gyn appointments.

Karen, insurance recommend? emails Tegnell refering keeping schools open make people effected reach herd immunity quicker CVS minute clinic appointments let people wait car texting time. pharmacies might offering same. US compared western countries instead comparisons countries hamstrung disproportionate poverty low per-capita health resources.

Because that's USA  still Segregation .   care alien space. person knows stuff. care about. give blank sex color are. care knowledge skills. Spoiler: never done. finding balance live with. pretty good insurance prenatal exams free. scans free too, long got ""approved"" scans age (8 week preg check, 20 week anatomy scan, glucose tolerance). opt additional genetic tests paid pocket because, 35yo, considered necessary. 

The birth $750 copay. plan had, could somewhat choose hospital (from list 5 6). total bill insurance $15,000, yay? Wooo! America first! make like stubborn this, Fauci publicly rolled back statement encouraging mask usage. High temperatures, high humidity high levels sterilizing UV radiation probably help, too. lived dorm, would accepted fact would likely get covid course year.. stave inevitability?

Also, flatten curve thing overload hospitals (and learn much could novel virus). Hospitals overloaded (currenly). honesltt think many believe effective vaccine hit helpful levels population gets another year two spread... Parents high school student charged hosting underage drinking party‚Äîdelays school return in-person classes 2 weeks help system designed make apathetic learning. Foreign language classes teach conversation, expect rest world speak English. excited take Spanish, classes consisted writing vocabulary interesting tidbits Spanish culture.

'An Underground History American Education' interesting read. written former new york city teacher year. highly recommend it.  Part previous comment cut wearing metal mesh 1 cm gaps, obviously virus pass right compared much smaller gap like better fabrics example. Perhaps gap even small enough whereas virus cannot pass through. something obviously better would completely blocking thick metal wall, gaps..  - literally simple, completely ridiculous think 'oh turn big computer', supplying mountain data go - problem like simply get directly point, problem solving 'common sense', completely avoiding drain life energy simplifying problem getting directly point; virus given size, therefore build mesh smaller virus - completely block altogether.

So, simplifying problem. say think careful - think - letting someone else decide you, therefore cannot react left alone, problem solving, knowing problem arise - completely rely 'supercomputer' tell do. state assistance, short answer would no. Obamacare Medicade different. medicade never pay copay going dr appointments pregnant. Sounds like maybe look different plan people still watch regular tv 70? spent two weeks barely able make bathroom back. left flat back weak even hold phone play match 3 game two weeks. sibling visit let kid visit &amp; got bacterial pneumonia put ER iv antibiotics. Even care making sicker know wtf thought letting kid sick. could given kid!

After always get flu shot &amp; make sure 4 strain even though younger usual age asked dr ok pneumonia vaccine well.

I glad read vaccine companies USA upping production since years around 50% US gets vaccine.

People know influenza go lung causing viral pneumonia. Getting shot helps prevent this. 

Additionally even strains spot close immune system react sooner totally novel strain.

Finally enlightened self-interest - protecting also protecting around can't safely vaccinated! I'm related someone severe allergic reaction multiple vaccines including influenza Dr dare give more. 

Thank protect others getting vaccinations!

Vaccines . gov links state's health departments show low cost sometimes free vaccine giving free flu shots without insurance year: Worse sign: teaching children incorrect apostrophe usage. think delayed reporting deaths limited Sweden, r/coronavirus obsession Sweden go reports fine tooth comb. Ireland think 90 days officially notify death, notified within week two similarly get older reports death occurred weeks ago. 

Only reporting cases days week seem differ standard international practice though Unfortunately, voting option. Even kick January next year. certainly train anyone capable working coffee shop day. Quick questionnaire pick problematic cases need actual medic check further, people get vaccine along morning coffee pastry. count different strain. strain, can't prove still original infection. Realistically, probably shotgun wedding Sounds like heard infections there. Combining sick vacation encourages people show work aren‚Äôt feeing well. easy solution. honestly blame work culture this. Parents get stuck place must choose job staying home lots jobs aren‚Äôt understanding. Great job. wonder get criticized horrible response. Trump could play Tony Stark. They're fictional billionaires.

The Iron Man suit might bit tough though... Never said common. cited experts saying fucking know. one hobby stats topic credentials for. problem US, FDA would involved vaccine released here.

Sure. They're required involved. can't release drug without approval. 

But luckily, FDA drug developer. They're regulatory agency. really approve deny drug based data drug maker gives them. Well, fast track regulatory steps usually languish months beurocratic queue phase development move US collaborating counties

That's really semantic middle finger rest world Oompa-idiot.

We're collaborating Pfizer Astra Zenica, collaborating running seperate trials several countries besides US.

Essentially, vaccine targeted worldwide release meet FDA's standards, standards UK, EU every country's regulatory agencies well, US's ability interfere material way development standards pharma companies extremely minimal, even current, rampantly corrupt leadership. things. First all, think perception average college student correct. large public universities equally large followings, entitled little shits party nonstop take whole thing granted? Yes. everyone? No. most? No. 50%? No. 

Same subject, instances this, frat boys jumping roofs, hazing, binge drinking, etc., always garners attention kid works 30+ hours week goes school full-time. plenty kids like that. never get credit - get lumped ""entitled millennial"" group. 

Second, f-ing lunch think average student work way college. recent grads lucky enough job college earn enough cash pay, in-full, tuition also affording meals, rent, auto payments, etc. Back 80's, father worked summer essentially paid following semester's tuition, saving Pontiac Trans-Am. way anyone now. minimum wages country absolute joke. mother father worked part-time school paid majority tuition costs, book/material costs, rent, food, car payments, actually money spare. Good them. realize times changed possible right now.  


Third, kids loans name. Sometimes entirely name, often conjunction parents. want buy kegs weed, it. money. yours, mine, parents. theirs. take debt, want.  


Everyone agrees average undergrad degree remotely worth kids (my younger self included) pay them. cost does? fed backs loans. Colleges turn charge want, Uncle Sam's eyes, everyone approved take massive amounts debt. 

So whose fault again? No. tell it‚Äôs Sweden since one guy wearing mask. ;-) currently run business one driving factors control / power. 10 children wife. Every job I've except last one gave paid days off. last job exception allowed take anytime needed .....family first policy. responsible building companies grew company had. real job title duties taking ideas turning million dollar businesses quick possible. paid well, family policy complete professional freedom build business direction wanted kept 5 1/2 years. eventually start company side making enough money pay bills month. ownership team job found fired last November 2019.

I love owning business I'm home day daughters homeschooling work. Since 6 a.m. put hours coloring puzzles math songs meals anything else gotten 43 cold sales calls put also. course are. fair, kids lie sick time. They've got cold? Come on. Fever? No? going school. Or, I've got big presentation work, here's advil, tough like I'm toughing out.

Live society everything work, get. Tough out, good little cog, it'll work blow brains 45. That‚Äôs wife Unless clinical side healthcare, limited exceptions employer use allow time FFCRA. two key portions act - paid sick leave EFMLA. 

The US Department Labor revised guidelines 10 days ago and, general, small employers qualify avoiding EFMLA. employer may try claim hardship exception, challenge interpretation. rules changing rapidly could employer date rules versus trying game system. weird. first, F5'd went right there. corona sick jobs 3 weeks without doctors' note get 80% payed. makes easier keep sick people working. perfect either. jobs people hourly contracts, think harder say jobs. Thank you! know that. u corona outbreak, 60% kids symptoms. like Typhoid Mary kind situation. know too, part plan destroy public education rich kids go private religious school everyone else get K-5 go vocational training service rich.

This called eating seed corn. ban me, truth. No. doesn‚Äôt say vaccines it‚Äôs clear lab created virus used challenge vaccine approved. Covid-19 challenge trial need approved UK Medicines Healthcare products Regulatory Agency independent research ethics committee.

I‚Äôm ethics injecting people disease treatment. already see people denial risks disease. It‚Äôs ethical give people disease can‚Äôt treat. Even rate transmission high - yesterday people predicted possibility 50,000 cases day UK months. Classic, US truly deserves higher numbers, country dumb Fertility rates declined due climate change pollution. nothing STDs. 

Declining fertility rates led ‚ÄúHandmaiden‚Äù scenario. That‚Äôs comment drew parallel. mostly due contraceptive access folks deciding child free less kids, US historic problem prenatal care rising stillbirth numbers. given current political climate incoming Supreme Court judge, don‚Äôt blame people making connection Handmaids Tale. flu gets 30k US deaths year? that's vaccine. think anything like 70k 80k see everything back normal. guy claimed secondary school Sweden open. counts secondary school Ireland really matter context.

I really care (pun inteded) advices Ireland. lost weight too. digestive system mess summer much appetite. Pretty sure anxiety ok little overweight anyway. Thanks reply J&amp;J one company capacity vaccinate sizable chunk world own, thats without China putting insane manufacturing work vaccines, serum institute india taking care country life maybe enjoys paid salary CCP. hire one million zombies inside China... Weird must desktop thing. watched phone went live stream well. desktop prob. neither ICU admissions deaths increased. actually got 700 first two weeks. reported mild headache first injection, follow infection procedures. come next day (100). mixed test resulted phone call every day next 2 weeks. (420).

I never asked receive money, part protocol. Even though small headache.

Also, opt time. Well, ok, then. meant, that's sort thing surprised see pre-COVID either. I've trying last hour doctor scientist hard time making since it, haha. 

More specifically Im trying see ALA (alpha-LA) LA different Omega-3 Supplements started taking (ALA Omega-3 acid LA Omega-6 acid apparently) potentially good bad link either ACE-2 receptors. others said unknown LA good bad without trials.

It would nice know ALA similar properties LA news LA comes good bad would insightful know stop Omega-3 Supplements happy already taking them.

Heres hoping find ELI5 ALA vs LA relation ACE-2 google, haha! certainly hope you‚Äôre right! probably tell lender that, they‚Äôll laugh face. think debt gonna go? Away? actually doesn‚Äôt phone - ‚Äúwatch live‚Äù ‚Äúwatch beginning.‚Äù tried ‚Äúlive‚Äù Lamar Alexander, legit thought dead. barely wear masks Sweden. death rate overall higher US, but, dangerous second wave. (Edit - record, I'm perfectly fine mask requirements. obtrusive, culturally odd) 

I believe unless contact trace, paths bend curve countries roughly end death rates.

I live county 2 million people roughly 300 deaths California. Great. keep brutal lockdown. let up, get 1st wave. Deaths like comparable population density. Lack incentives? We've never coronavirus poses dire threat whole world before. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll ask roommate expand said, she‚Äôs physio student 1:28:17 Didn‚Äôt work iPhone found ‚Äústarred‚Äù point timeline Rand starts talking. Around 1:29:00 similar issues approach Swedish Public Health. 

I mean Ireland. Swedish Britain family Ireland. makes sense Ireland seek advice model around twice disease twice death. like copying someone who's guessed answers half country. American, can‚Äôt even explain LUXURIOUS sounds. Beyond anything US would ever even consider doing. Ask local schools again. ones near dropped health checks. March maybe bit early. seem track largely free virus time next year. It‚Äôs harder say economic consequences going shake out. quote this, urgency MERS SARS died fairly quickly. believe Oxford team (Sarah Gilbert etc) working MERS vaccine never really got trialed outside animals (that actually basis Chadox vaccine trials now). really died time would need conduct Phase III trial, requires spread quick results. Sars-coV2 lot less deadly SARS stuck around that. still MERS vaccines trials right actually, Phase I. Also, mRNA vaccines come along quite bit.

The Phase II results vaccines really strong. Would recommend reading Derek Lowe Sciencemag article leading candidate trial results come out. Exchange begins 1:28:17. raced call something like covid-19 calling 'china virus' took hold. Agreed. Im essential, I'm hostage. work pandemic get screwed financially. Criminal... It‚Äôs hard understand people children cannot afford them.

Why people always say this? never considered people luck? know medical expenses bankrupt someone financially well, right? Divorces always ruin someone‚Äôs finances. wish people would stop saying it‚Äôs incredibly ignorant callous. every American become poor right circumstances hit you. keep hearing exact response TON politicians, him. Regardless intelligence, evil still evil. Big surprise one pay student loans right now. Quit bitching me. Hahaha care much ban truth. China downfall imminent, either like not. lol Ok, well never intended talk militant anti-private healthcare spokesperson, I'm going nope fuck whatever is. mean origin, spike anti-Asian xenophobia warrants name would cause increase harassment violence. Plus people confuse many East Asians Chinese thus people targetted.

Also scientific mandate call SARS-CoV 2 COVID condition.

Take look rhetoric say Turning Point USA strong xenophobic tone talk ""China Flu"" ""China Virus"". name used matters. can‚Äôt blame lot parents either. wasn‚Äôt able stay home sick middle school, parents often pushed get younger. know students deal with. also know sick time younger siblings are, baby sit. It‚Äôs really tough, wanted make sure parents staying home sick kids, large companies pay enough workers afford take time off. That‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs solution it‚Äôs upsetting people don‚Äôt think richer person little less rich solution blaming parents.

Likewise, stay home parent this, you‚Äôre helping you‚Äôre jerk kids community. health department gonna send qualified, background-checked sitter take care sick kid free parents work? gonna pay bills buy groceries family parent take unpaid time work gets fired need take time work care child?

If not, COURSE people gonna lie. know else saying it? KIDS school who‚Äôs parents sent them. Lol mask debate demonstrated us, certainty, good percentage American's selfish pricks require force order right thing. never kind money behind it. got close SARS previously since burned kind fast follow-through political funding. Rand Paul üí© brains. I've getting people's opinions this. ""open everything up"" person know said wedding. Another person told Bell articles written him. teachers come sick time too. system nightmare. mean, expected government President remain mostly denial dangers Covid-19, country cherishes military all. Well already attending school everyday guess see much difference this?Transmission outdoors wearing masks unlikely. live country usually get families coming house anyways. didn't. vaccine masks may offer little additional benefit, still think worth anyway. 

So question becomes, flu every year? mean, tens thousands people die flu, flu actually deadly kids. wear every year? 

It's small price pay save innocent child's life, correct? Graduating college economy collapsed worse IMO. College debt zero jobs. That's necessarily realism though. That's moderation. Taking two opposing sides picking middle. Realism ignoring pessimist optimist opinions, following information. Realism could land either side depending on, well, reality. Ya spent 2months type 5 ac separation could get Reconstructive surgery shoulder. 


And injured unemployment kicked wants pay back $3600. 

If dads health insurance, would've fucked even more.( surgery cost $3200 instead $60,000...)  Hey dude it‚Äôs me, paying student loans that‚Äôre still due every month.  it, fucking finally, somenone officially bitched every fucking company nearing end vaccines end pandemic.

Let's summarize

Russian vaccine: ""not tested enough, take it"" (fair)

Chinese vaccines: ""I take vaccine china, half ass everything reason pandemic""

Moderna: ""Those guys profit-hungry fuckers, they've released data, taking one""

Oxford ""I wont take one one discredited Forbes Article protect fucking monkeys COVID despite exposed COVID levels far beyond see world""

Pfizer:"" another greedy pharmaceutical company, RNA shot take that""

And finally J &amp; J: ""I'm sure company willfully shoving asbestos babies' assholes women's vaginas take shortcuts here!""

I fucking hate country much people making excuses every fucking vaccine take hoping least get pandemic better sick day policy. see happening. 

In company, get PTO. take sick day, basically taking vacation. encourages people go work sick take away vacation. yes, I've gotten sick people many times. called human challenge trials planned many vaccine candidates. I'll agree (although like DF rubbing hands together, thinking ""going get us""), OK, that's cool, whatever. 
So pisses losing mind president dumpster fire minions still pushing b.s. Many younger generations do. last presidential election first voted in, crawl mountain broken glass November. threat trump never cared to, parties let don‚Äôt left party, far right center party. socialists like became disenfranchised voting one could vote would ever represent values.

## Abstract

COVID-19, consequence infection novel viral agent SARS-CoV-2, first identified China (Hubei Province), declared pandemic WHO. September 10, 2020, 70,000 cases 2,000 deaths recorded Poland. many factors contributing level transmission virus, weather appears significant. work analyse impact weather factors temperature, relative humidity, wind speed ground level ozone concentration number COVID-19 cases Warsaw, Poland. obtained results show inverse correlation ground level ozone concentration daily number COVID-19 cases. kept pushing us hold born well. severe edema, could tell going look like baby came, made decision see him. wanted honor memory personal visions would been, without tying horrible visual. like all. Yes, stated recommending masks may dangerous. part anti-science, since know everywhere even partially wears masks seen massive decline spread, zero chance would increase spread.

It might make sense save mask recommendation winter. R doubles winter (unlikely) could wear masks winter summer level economic openness seasons. Maybe better wearing masks year round social distancing country winter everyone behave normally summer. hell lot expensive though. i'm going halloween rave/festival two days i'll cosplaying [as one wade often, social media general try remember douchecanoe responding reads it, there's hopefully people take saying comment. peoples' minds can't changed, every one figure there's quiet ones little open argument, matter too. Sure. Send article one you‚Äôve got sec. lol. really scared wearing mask aren‚Äôt you? That‚Äôs weird affliction. Klingon's Qo'noS. Klingon species lives there. pockets stupidity, notable Sturgess. represents fraction fraction population. 

Also, (Sept. 9, 2020): 

Bloomberg: [Covid-19 Cases Surge 460 Counties Sturgis Riders Hailed usually counter with.... ""Ok, saying taxes increase $xxx. much paying insurance premiums every month? add deductibles, copays, etc... sure budget emergency broken arm, accident, fall, child, much ACTUALLY spending healthcare every year?"" usually way tax increase they're angry about. Sometimes (admittedly rarely), see lightbulb go off. times, double repeat ""well still want pay fat lazy people."" Drastically different circumstances 2012 now, though Hmm, attempted murder charges? Time take seriously folks. stupidity starts killing people it‚Äôs really different pointing gun someone. 33 weeks pregnant absolutely feel rushed uneducated alot go appointments. first time mother,had miscarriage 10 weeks 2 years ago. weird symptoms pain right side, vision problems also,so called made appointment weeks ago . get in,do vitals weight, medical assistant leaves room,in snarky attitude tells pushing next appointment, since came today seen. understand want expose mother baby potential infection, felt like punished making appointment seen,and going take away one scheduled appointments ""one appointment "" every 3 half weeks out... story shitty parents knowingly sending sick kids school.

I'm sure product shitty parenting, see connection. context, NSW - Australia‚Äôs populous state home Sydney - gradually left lockdown stages starting May. lockdown eliminated COVID state outside Sydney almost eliminated within Sydney. 

Cases spiked July large cluster Sydney sparked traveller Melbourne started break again. rather return restrictions, NSW instead managed suppress outbreak multiple ones months following aggressive testing contact tracing. Taking us second wave peak 20 local cases per day July, low 0 past two days.

Hopefully keep up. thing CDC statements like them, simply wait day complete opposite statement come out, hand edited maybe Trump minion So, knows school-related case counts (and ""friends""), West Virginia people dark ... that's virus deaths, tithe donald trump's campaign. Let's bet group saying vaccines cause autism many Starbucks dude. probably find one staff got sick wearing mask too. Agreed. schools share, unfortunately. $150/month... Jesus, now?

And course that's packed advertisements. paying us service. People change really quick.

No Fox New, Alex Jones, Joe Rogan, Youtube, Facebook tell unconstitutional rise Fascist left exercise first amendment rights. fat fuck, many WV don‚Äôt diploma. WV Deserve him. Seven years us now. Also seemingly perfect pregnancy, also get answers afterwards went wrong.

It's unique kind devastation; gets easier live never goes away. Whait, one fact deniers? Yeah, pass. considered radical view many Americans they‚Äôre imported China ...? Shouldn‚Äôt Labor Commerce leading effort retool shut manufacturing produce equipment need, need foreseeable future? That‚Äôs china‚Äôs fault ... dear friend Tommy passed away Las Vegas 9:45 last night deep regret

A good example importance punctuation. 37.5 million people living Canada. survey 1538 people. even justify saying majority Candians agree masks surveyed less 0.00005% population. Completely unacceptable. Masks made mandatory major Alberta cities August since cases spiked increased faster rate the. June /July masks mandatory. must working right. 

Side note... read article CDC yesterday stating glasses help prevent catching disease 82% cases China people wear 18% cases people do. civic duty wear glasses next month. hold past try. This. also tell red hat. Jesus, that's heart wrenching. son gone 3 weeks, took another week get hospital. havoc wife's mental well being. can't imagine carrying term knowing that. Never underestimate willingness humans troll survey. Another young person. many yet man cannot named says practically invincible. patient sick soon passed away existing illness unknown. amazes people react things emotionally..

But guess makes sense since we've defunded education point huge chunk country know use brain.  Republicans old people don‚Äôt care wear masks infringe freedoms. guy come house campaigning dan kondl without mask handing shit out. People don‚Äôt want that. disease since last pandemic killed 200,000 Americans months?

this relevant. complications think false?

None, people subreddit acting like crazy game changing thing concerned ""novel"" virus. anything kill also cause long term illnesses mean happen significant degree. Implement penalties this. Monetary fines. People change really quick. stop testing China, fact think either shows paying attention grossly misinformed. virus first reappeared Wuhan, lockdown, tested literally every single person entire city sure virus gone. They've done several cities since. start treating less threat, still go full panic mode smallest outbreak.

New Zealand may smaller population, city Auckland, New Zealand actually similar population density Wuhan. Auckland happen's centre New Zealand's COVID outbreak. Well least clear coronavirus attach cells spikes effort prevent attaching welcome breakthru even though might need studies. least target achieve. crazy, qualify free flu shot UK costs ¬£20 places less ¬£10 Tesco ¬£9 in-store pharmacy... Also, women‚Äôs pain often disregarded, especially women color. there‚Äôs looooong history behind that. There‚Äôs one case black man whose wife died childbirth. went nurse many times saying, something‚Äôs wrong, overlooked. late. It‚Äôs incredibly sad story that, unfortunately, isn‚Äôt uncommon. 

The US ranks among worst developed world mother child death birth, child mortality remember correctly. wear mask wash hands, social distance public, boyfriend. Covid spreading rapidly deadly need cut physical contact people asthma... mean, mean business, think right means course, nobody telling can't see boyfriend. That's entirely self imposed. Found guy never left LA County mandatory wear mask even alone street. People Belgium becoming hostile toward masks council made changes. 10k dead? Belgian, can't really explain it, things half deaths places old people go (i know name english sorry). We're giving rules strict since March (you see 5 people per week). agree unlikely greatly prevalent, also know lot cases going unconfirmed/untested early on. would make *much* easier people slip cracks, speak, second infection confirmed.

I think greatly prevalent, would already found it. question common might re-infection occur, negligible actually (and cautious probably good idea). Jabba TRIPPIN' i'm pro-choice undecided universal healthcare, point, contraception free via health department. unplanned pregnancies generally lack preparation moment pleasure. 18 years locked parenthood want wrap it? that's you.. seen numbers high 40% proportion population whole could considered underlying condition.

About 45% Americans hypertension, 40% number clearly wrong. number Americans ""underlying condition"" higher that. guys really watch way much apocalypse fiction, children men sperm count human males plummeted zero, feminist civil war broke out, mankind faces imminent extinction. exactly appointments happening COVID affected access routine antenatal care it? Oh completely agree think saying perspective comments saying affecting overall pregnancy outcomes data. Fewer screenings early pregnancy likely not, fewer screenings 12 weeks likely do, since causes loss different (early loss preventable pregnancy itself, later loss mitigated).

Best wishes also! 80 degrees yesterday. Exactly. still focused surfaces? sure you‚Äôre downvoted. ordered pay billions. ‚Äú...court said fact Johnson &amp; Johnson sold products without warning might contaminated asbestos, known cancer causer, displayed either ""evil motive reckless indifference"" part company.‚Äù reacted like Honestly I‚Äôve caught couple ‚Äúwhat doing‚Äù moments. little habits instincts coming things getting back normal. Like today picked Starbucks almost instinctively started pulling mask drink it. I‚Äôm NYC, indoor dining allowed. Thankfully caught myself. False positives incredibly rare. PCR tests can't amplify genes there. matter time see does. It‚Äôs gonna effect personally one way another. point it‚Äôs bound happen! Also, would need day-to-day information? trends important anyway. Numbers flutcuate time, average counts. still effect COVID pandemic.

Place blame belongs. 6 months people saying would happen, immediate response skepticism was, ""You care saving lives!""

Well turns skeptics right. response COVID costing human lives. technically effect COVID, entirely self-inflicted.

If response infected cut amputate arm instead taking antibiotics, yes technically amputated arm effect infection. overreaction idiotic response real reason arm missing. facts readily available verify doctorate? Fire Department said Jason Dean beloved 20-year veteran firefighting survived wife two daughters, ages 13 7. Wish ran trials Oklahoma could participate. Personally, rooting Pfizer candidate approved ASAP, sound like better around vaccine far ease deployment goes. feel confident people generate long-term immune response infection. 11 cases right seems solid consider we‚Äôve millions atm. Using evidence think like viruses small portion people get reinfected. all, thing happens common disease earth (the flu)   stops liars. ‚Äúattendance‚Äù culture... people insist fine fever. def good indicator everyone virus, I‚Äôd feel slightly better knowing one building fever... 

The problem leap conclusions assume fever = virus. false sense security dangerous thing. Failure rates 2013 /= failure rates global effort 2020.

Get better lol Yeah, perfect sub. Never let readily available facts challenge pre-determined narrative. Honestly thats good thing me. Take money would spending sports actually put dying music art programs they're arguably lot important sports.  I'm acquaintances lot people knew Juice like brother. see fellow brother-in-arms terms football gone devastating me. Rest Power Juice! would say starts fact spread surfaces. still here? 

This APRIL... Read moment guess ‚Äúmedian‚Äù didn‚Äôt ring disease since last pandemic killed 200,000 Americans months? doesn‚Äôt actually say (that could see ads anyway) implementation would be. could still antibody training vaccine. Sigh. C.D.C lost attention ago. I'm sure direct cause people non mask wearing. really trust pay attention anything say. trust friend told "" novel"" means, wearing mask everywhere outside, using sanitizer hands along hand washing. longer stay home inside day months end like first. go camping shopping food, I'm looking work. said months ago, first wave hit peak, big kahuna 1) virus spreads little open spaces especially people use masks case. BLM protests outside USA translated increase cases

2) protesting what's fair call low standard country have, one flawed logic. sure. Even Cuomo buckled pressure lawsuits restaurants. lights, choice!!


If wants kids candy, buy herself. teach satan worshipping beggars. agree. also, pythons constrictors - yes, cover airway, please. People volunteer dangerous, even deadly things time. US military service voluntary result death pretty nasty injury. think people fight wildfires risk lives every day fire season facing many risks injury long term problems smoke inhalation. long volunteer human challenge trials informed possible known risks see problem. trial participants heroes book. Really difficult make 7 billion doses vaccines. real problem packaging them, shipping delivering(injecting) them.
Biological stuff weird this, vaccine like 10mg stuff dissolved 1ml buffering solution glycerol maybe (depends vaccine). unfeasible make kilos stuff week single lab. Put emergency mode get to. Also: see Amazon Uh, college football player died weeks ago least there's one death. There's also hospitalizations university nearest house I'm going assume making Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* vaccine merely band-aid sucking chest wound. Get used new world, adaptability makes humans resilient.

Unfortunately pathetic basement dwellers like you, adaptation permanent social distancing lockdowns. general acceptance shit happens people keep normal. Even parents working cant afford get sick usa, thats another issue people's stupidity cured piece plumbum accelerated 900 mph taken orally...I guess? Thank much! know fear speaking up,I guess want hassel. forsure advocate myself. Thank you! thank Healthcare worker cares! Much love stay healthy! twam Yes is. Soon read ""YMCA"", bell went brain. Yep, sure heck job would useful vaccine testing!

Glad autoimmune disorder gone. interested, frankly, vaccine response had. Glad could clear packs small wallop apparently, interesting.

Good actually able utilize vaccine safety people around you. course occurred volunteering vaccine (if successful) also bit way cut line buy added safety, good public service.

But still ""*if i*t works"".

Anyways thanks! Appreciate feedback, hope something similar. going say exactly this, THANK YOU. Tell artists whose livelihoods depend house 3,000+ patrons audience every performance. way forward vaccine allows opera houses filled again. I'm sorry, can't opera Zoom, matter much people try convince can.  I'm fence it, 200 trick treaters rain power outage last year. feeling covid cut number hundred, they're still going about. live area people seem acknowledge virus exists. I'm likely going individual bags table front driveway one tries knocking door. They're same. I've heard questionable things Planned Parenthood too. personally support masquerade, although support advertising toward people considering abortion, make sure find alternatives. Well going better job, sick exhausted employee who's worked sick month person actually saw doctor got health taken care off, back full health 100% work capability within week? ‚ÄúFinal‚Äù stage. 

This trials failed. get that, someone high risk doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre fortunate enough isolate. Still weak PCR-positive result 7 month?

Maybe also found first case virus persistence. Irresponsible adults Singapore, cases workers‚Äô dormitories, patients young physically fit death rate extremely low well. gonna babysit? is, many people 80% - could get - enough anyhow. Far many people living paycheck paycheck, multiple jobs, barely squeaking by. Many, not, able slow descent abject poverty. One problems discussion people like polarize extremes 

They either accuse wanting Soviet style communism

Or 

They want advocate 100% capitalism social services kind, every man themselves

No one ever considers middle ground two. everyone acts like millionaires afford argue this. poll right now. OP talking people breaking finding plan another fucking year. 

You tell people year ruined. Christmas next year cancelled too. find change tone. refering exactly? probably impossible completely separate emergence zoonotic virus climate change, yes, ""normal"" context mean going back 1850. means able go outside without mask, going parties concerts, hugging grandparents again. 

Climate change bring set challenges future generations, long March 2020. even realistic approach? Old people still need go buy groceries. still need visit doctor's/dentist's office. still need go buy new clothes clothing shop old clothes get shitty/worn out. need see kids/grandkids point. idea elderly people totally isolated everyone else get lives seems easy theory, practice basically confining 10-20% population solitary confinement for, what, years? school reward high attendance require doctor's note child take sick day? so, probably incentivizing parents send kids anyway... broke record.

474 hospitalizations entire state. Wisconsin large state.

New cases ICU patients time low. Please read stats official Wisconsin health association website.

This article fear porn. Look many look past headlines. trump one ""peaceful protests"" there. Masks required worn... hmmm wonder... said also black women often disregarded doctors who, especially older ones, classically trained believe black people higher pain tolerance complain more.

people just... listen black women say think something wrong children die often. famous example Serena Williams complained hours almost died hemorrhage daughter. Jesus fucking christ. wonder would believe tell protected 5G tin foil hats. basically steroids supposed do? That's people power country seem believe virus exists. actual leadership country would stop treating like common flu, people look leadership may actually follow suit instead behaving like flock morons. USA (and Uganda) can't far, far poorer per capita Sweden.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Shitty parents always sending sick kids school colds, flus, mumps, fevers, etc. surprise happened? Completely naive expect better. Ozone apparently really good it. went holiday park conversation one cleaners there, said using aqueous ozone (ozone infused water) everything hard surfaces sofas curtains kill virus. This. American people given enough revolt en masse. Propaganda downplays class difference divides people among racial lines, won‚Äôt ever unified revolt. Almost half would benefit systemic revolution verbally defend death status quo leaves poorer less healthy time. It‚Äôs game. look back upon clusterfuck known 2020, reopening universities k-12 schools going stand glaring mistake. Genuinely curious, would want cop? justifiably insane. Easiest course obviously go get test company needs get reported even asking. misinformation though. studies shown mutations causing decrease severity. Mortality rates fallen due better treatments higher proportion younger people getting infected. screwed building TTI.

If failed keep population disciplined.

If government able willing ameliorate economic pain.

You still listen old emeritus banking herd immunity. I‚Äôm glad daughter still school home.  Fevers understand, runny noses?

My toddler runny nose pretty much entire summer. probably allergy related, he's 2 whole lot done it.

If allowed go daycare runny nose I'd forced quit job stay home him, would many mothers I'm sure. Give everyone 2,000$ year. Go back hole fascist ‚ÄòHealthcare money people.‚Äô

* USA

In rest world case. change destiny voting, lobbying raising public awareness. 

Those us countries hopeful find way. Wisconsin major protests now? No, time everyone else. Funny cherry pick people's proof without providing own. Even paid sick days still get sick employees coming want ""waste sick day"" (either they'd rather use play-hooky days they're well get like 3 per year still January want save they're ""really"" sick). Probably near impossible get doctor's appointment anything areas COVID. course need social safety net parents afford stay home kids sick, place rest blame school policies.

Many schools still reward **attendance** give awards perfect attendance. obviously incentivizes kids come school even they're sick, needs end.

Many schools also require **doctor's note**. Getting doctor's note *huge pain ass*, especially minor sickness require doctor's care all! wasting health care resources definitely causing parents send kids anyway rather deal note.

Then, many teachers act like imposition get sick. gather extra materials you, help catch up. seem really resentful.

What schools need instead, especially year, rewarding encouraging kids stay home school they're sick. Many kids learning home anyway! new normal - always free learn home needed. even issue unless start miss 30 days, meeting make sure still getting attention need. war virus, need war things. Coming curiosity, tell this. honestly know women go get abortion every month vs using good birth control. mean, costs alone... pain... much last resort assume talking people two three abortions. know say body choice hope figure better birth control since clearly whatever they're working them. Sometimes people try natural family planning method due religion wanting hormones foreign body inside get shocked Pikachu face conceive. simpler get pill something, even fail. Even stable menstrual cycles wtf month toast.

For situation, can't take pill blood clot ten years ago. look PP Paragard, take insurance household made much qualify aid. ended getting sterilized end want chance failure. took tubes entirely, get pregnant viable idk, guess I'll get hysterectomy :P. cost $4,000 total, means pay many others don't.

I see deleted comment/profile idk get message. ‚Äú short lockdown ‚Äú won‚Äôt last weeks. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve seen ‚Äú happy 6 months anniversary 14 days flatten curve ‚Äú memes. 

It‚Äôll 2 weeks it‚Äôll ‚Äú cases rising need extend lockdown ‚Äú it‚Äôll thing had. economy can‚Äôt handle another one Make crime. mention, vast majority software development done home, outside sensitive projects - there's almost reason go office every single day, long people productive. socialism anything destroyed Venezuela, US that. US foreign policy economically crippling sometimes even direct military actions coups small enough able fight back country tries kind socialist system, like shooting someone knees going look! socialists cant walk right! 

and Venezuela issues lacking economic diversity dependent oil, almost developed western nation could pull socialist system ease, quite European countries quite way path already. I'm sure either, Covid complicates situation. I'm Canada, unless visible minority, jump bunch hoops get in. really pisses place flooded ton people can't read write English, can't drive (yet somehow afford luxury car) appear sit home collecting government hand outs.

I'd much rather let people countries similar structure hit ground running actually bring something economy Art always exist.  I'm convinced current way view COVID risk, indoor events, etc, Met operate always next September, next several Septembers that.  makes fear existence - art generally.  Art survives everything, particular purveyors art flexible forward-thinking survive thrive.

I agree lot much reason live without lot things we've lost.  That's think we've entered stage COVID learn live it, rather keep pretending going disappear postpone everything then. Well fighting losing battle friend. virus get less deadly infects people. Survivability host increases proliferation, evolution. Thats say dangerous virus safety measures overblown, danger real. think mortality rates December Feburary, fooling yourself. 

What interesting start vaccinating portions populations turn put selective pressures virus. Thats things could start get real ugly again. 

Perhaps frustrating part talking lunatics wear masks/ concerned virus use argument justify irresponsible behavior. Though doesn't. would fired? Seems really simple ... Zero specifics article many took place. Zero. Additionally person quoted article doctor. doubt parents send kids school sick. also think highly irresponsible journalism demand specifics story like taking generic words truth without verifying them. It‚Äôs time society grants people appropriate sick leave sick child. ridiculous it‚Äôs people can‚Äôt miss work. Nah, I'm asking Denmark meant. ones passed clinical trials. issue hand vaccines multiple years clinical trials follow up. True. I've seen same, time, also cases there, likely result diminished population compared states. 


All days protect part problem. 

Keep safe there, hoping wind snow drifts winter reduce spread people dont go out. Ummm major protests last 7 days oregon seattle....NY immune getting wrecked. care believe last bit Apparently refuse allow person back work get proper test, even though worker gotten test tested negative.

*Edit: Aaaand person crying I'm selfish trying get fired. Says money pay new test anyway.  Ive got 3 kids, made stay home everytime one runny nose cough wouldnt ever go school. online schooling. US money. Fuck health, fuck kids, fuck you. country's motto. Pay die off.
We've harping healthcare since born almost nothing changed, doubt lifetime. wish schools giving vulnerable employees sick leave. one choose unemployment risking life. colleague black, 50, diabetic, asthmatic. shouldn‚Äôt working right now, pay bills. Really shows broken system parents can't even stay home sick kids "" "" work keep bills paid. 

America failed people far long. Ya'll need socialistic democracy... democrazy. Ive got 3 kids, made stay home everytime one runny nose cough wouldnt ever go school. online schooling. increasing slowly schools reopened 10 days ago.

Not optimistic outcome. Hope I'm wrong. Thanks admitting Denmark worse Sweden. Right? impending zombie war isn‚Äôt going fight itself, it?? report, no. that's study, that's report ""study"" Realistically, hard immigrate Sweden. matter years need qualified field that's demand like canada? live individual fined wearing mask, business also fined serving they're wearing mask.

This results 16 year olds expected basically enforce laws, tell grown adults screaming need leave.

They idea handle situation. either, fair, least I'm assertive adult. 

Like covid happened even allowed say ""no"" customer kids supposed enforce rules direction how. Nobody saw coming all!

#***/S*** work closely many people Nigeria Ghana. Feedback people getting sick nearly recovering. 

Looking demographics, median age Ghana (20.7) roughly half USA (38.2). Given differences population pyramids, West African population exponentially less susceptible Covid. 

Also, levels obesity significantly lower USA (71.6% Americans overweight!). 

This anecdotal, visits, people way fitter West Africa whole. 

On sadder note, vulnerable GH/NG tend die younger age. mind, Covid‚Äôs ‚Äòsuccess‚Äô lower chance achieving mortality fewer elderly, weak unhealthy. factor ten more. know isn't. Unfortunately not. Around 15% workforce contractors (think Uber drivers, delivery drivers) zero sick days vacation days. hope greatly enjoys time prison. corporations get best worlds. US higher tax rate support military case need invade country natural resources.

At time, corps offshore get favorable tax rates people can't. get benefits higher taxes avoiding cost actually paying higher taxes. Ingenious really economy shit already. going get anything different. fucking opened schools. think going happen. open schools jobs pandemic, sick people work sick kids go school.

Christ I‚Äôm tired stupid shit. Stupidity followed stupidity. It‚Äôs insane. It‚Äôs smarter keep job pay rent sending kid school stay home get evicted. 

Besides, it‚Äôs right wing thing anyway, kid already it, worry about? Well... increase yes. dramatic one? No... 250 cases 16k tests compared yesterday.

Problem 250.. schools reopened 10 days ago still see full effect this. US afraid form socialism, even logical policies ignored. Refreshing see American say tbh work though. going do, fire you? Tell fuck horse rode on. Thats hillbilly shit ask people work get tested even paying it. helping build herd immunity. That's employer figure out.

Yeah, obviously employer equal footing negotiate thing. like employer's lack sick leave, welcome work anyone else, also sick leave. Yes, guns/butter comparison.

Yeah, employs people, employ people way? make way guns make way butter? I'm going guess first infection weakened lungs organs, making susceptible severe secondary infection. novel idea, scenic flight. Also huge waste jet fuel, fuck Fox News. got friend Facebook, thought crazy begin with. Covid shown shes full blown mental case. Anti seatbelt, anti vaccine, anti mask, thinks 5g ploy get chips implanted vaccine, literally thinks 5g causes people get sick, thinks Bill Gates behind it, gone war spectrum, could go on. Lights covid Probably cable companies abuse absolute shit clients way can. Upgrade service? One click online. Cancel service? 3 hours phone calls countless transfers. Nonsense rental fees, hidden charges, horrible customer service etc.

It's funny really. post r/politics love information. Gathering info preparing report. dare paint entire caregiving profession greedy hacks.

I think initial ""You speak doctors"" remark quite enough. glaringly obvious comment mostly anecdotal ""they"" probably refers ""most doctors"", even ""a large contingent doctors"". always worthwhile specify though, people going take comment attack every single person profession.

Meanwhile, don‚Äôt quarantine less 60 minutes. would occasionally think wonder happened him. Balls steel man. Nothing respect. time preexisiting conditions reimposed. - claim denied due covid exposure, could anyone disprove that? kid, yes. Little kids look forward Halloween year suggested shitty alternative. Agreed sad thing people choosing send sick kids school probably financial insecurity first place.

It‚Äôs expensive poor. Lol, nice one. contraception supposed free insurance ended saddled $900 it... would never trust condoms alone, break fucked ways one. talking Spain France? Because, according you‚Äôre reasoning, second wave would virtually impossible almost everybody wears mask. I'm still waiting mushrooms eat plastic waste. Basically, yes. 

Funnily enough, Planned Parenthood one place low-income pregnant women receive free reduced cost prenatal care. called pro-life crowd fighting tooth nail shut down. specificingly hiring someone man one hete Orange county California, basically itsvan easy up, tables displays, sell h, like concert. things, need merchandise.

I think financial safety net encourage risk/elderly stay home. live risk/elderly eligible benefits. really makes sense quarantine people care live them. There‚Äôs reason content gets removed dude  They're still pretty well overall however. Death rates remain low.

Here's Wisconsin's latest case/death 21.44 deaths per 100k population, 1/3 US national per capita Yes, socialism definitely answer! hasn't, know, caused problems like starvation, scarcity, corruption, genocide, etc etc

Back data verbal diarrhea.  forgot selfish. selfish also mean employers let employees paid sick days. happens, working parents continue send sick kids school. agree it, understand happens. don‚Äôt think issue here. reporting labs FHM system (SmiNet) takes longer weekends (staffing) data complete Monday. wait labs catch digital paperwork.

Sad see health care facilities retirement homes city who've avoided cases suddenly reporting first case, even new PPE procedures already settled daily routine staff.

How happening? money temp agency staff (mostly PSWs) facility managers rely increasingly health care workers dwindle supply (and get sick pass away themselves) one-facility-per-health-worker rule remains place LOA's pile never end. Agency staff adhere rule though *or* get tested every two weeks like health care workers. Health care agency staff still required testing done prior starting shift health care facility either, even they've never before. They'll facility outbreak, maybe, manager assertive testing (which credit are). part, health care agency managers actively resisting employee testing prior arrival even though staff bounce around facilities pose greater risk. see rule come it, simply it. better business model less informed. Here's latest case/death charts Virginia, running 7-day state well. They're currently 35.90 deaths per 100k population. ranks 27th per capita thinking reality it.

Anti-mask parents jump opportunity go droves maskless kids mingling together feel smug *their kids* socializing back normal.

Little Timmy, whose parents safe home throughout Pandemic, made fun wearing mask there's way they're gonna socially distance hopped candy soda.

Plus, every house stop would effectively become crowd queue. Multiply time every group every house.

Then, think parents co-mingling decide Halloween time party cut loose little long damned year neighbor offering free beer.

In theory, Halloween could absolute safest holiday. practice it'll handled like ass general public. know well cases drastically undercounted. NYC antibody studies suggest 1 2 million people city covid March/April, officially like 20 300k. Deaths accurate, assuming fatality rates somewhat constant, give better idea many people infected. Or. could just. open. Nice work guys. Truly top notch.

Option 1: wear consistently wear masks months virus gets controlled virtually eliminated like Taiwan South Korea Singapore.

Option 2: scream ""buT mUh fReeDUmBz!"" ""iT's teH fLu!"" half year chance mutate something either worse, least different enough one's immune system recognizes get twice virus price.

If look vitamin values COVID positive group (19 +/- 0.59 ng/ml) COVID negative group (20.55 +/- 0.23 ng/ml), still well limit authors define 'low' 'sub-optimal' (30 ng/ml).

It might good divided population groups different vitamin levels (high, sufficient, low) considered infection risk groups addition looking positive group negative group. total number infections. rarely see anyone wearing mask. guess live different Canada. Alabama, Texas, Kentucky, Florida!! Step game!!! Constitutional right!! Well, fair, neither stuff like this:

‚ÄúIf look masks buy drug store, leakage around really much protect you. People start saying, 'Should start wearing mask?' Now, United States, absolutely reason whatsoever wear mask."" - Dr. Anthony Fauci, February wish! ever someone mentions russia brain instead thinking actual russia thinks bear wearing Soviet ushanka holding bottle vodka. Fun fact: governor democrat, switched republican party years back saw way wind blowing WV realized he'd rather keep seat stand platform ran on. public health director-general says well. title correct matter read it. vast majority people Japan wearing masks since pandemic began. lot people know excess deaths (and lot people think excess deaths LOWER covid death count, used argue virus less deadly).

Unfortunately, lot people struggle form new opinion given new information, invested opinion.

I openly admit explain completely underestimated seriousness many predictions wrong. seem help people. Sorry loss, exactly mean unnecessarily?

As far understand really know reason can't anything really unnecessary moment? Absolutely CoVid! masks seen Walmart (thank you, Destroyer Small Businesses!). science clear _if nothing else changes_, masks work really well.
But wearing mask changes behavior, clear cut. believe mask protects you, might less concerned social distancing. science clear this: physical distance _the single one important thing_ do. wearing mask changes that, really contra productive. Read article Antibodies work similar way - body makes new protein binds viral protein. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies extracted people's bodies usually target spike protein intent sticking neutralizing it.

A vaccine early warning: here's viral fragments, make antibody protein neutralizes it. think Republican problem country might fix itself. case aware, China imposed ""emergency standards"" epidemic.
These masks labeled ""emergency standard"", foreigners want study Chinese certification standards, Chinese matter.
Including KN95 masks medical-surgical masks, use ourselves.
In fact importer must known ""emergency standard"", never communicated (why else sue Chinese supplier?).
If know someone foreign trade medical devices, ask it.
In fact, many Chinese manufacturers given exporting masks fear foreigners prosecute quality first, signed liability waiver agreements foreign importers.
The first masks bought ones signed waivers.
That's said, ""It's choice.""

Do know foreign importers bought masks back then? would send money directly Chinese supplier's account without communication, rush shipment, desperately stock! places also spiked cases high higher wisconsin, wisconsin actually care enough hospitalise them, led high hospitalisation rates Yay? goddamn shame poll :) Fuck Twitter, part American trident disinformation. would sue employees kid went daycare. Madison, rarity see somebody without mask publicly accessible building, obviously helped city mandate. However weeks ago going Rosendale, saw numerous maskless people gas station surrounding pop-up Trump store street corner (only gas station employees masked up). walked back gas station decided stop different town seeing recklessness. really depressing since grew part Wisconsin would've hoped smarter cautious that. mean yes? Sweden crime. That‚Äôs sometimes. Stupid. bad bot What!? share details? (Not name school, high-level...college, high-schools? Party?) Agreed. Something said earlier conversation offended mods notified comment deleted. Oh well. everybody happy everybody else's opinions. stupid Amazon...just read reviews carefully. get it, examine packaging tips/tears. Expiration date 2025. catch eyes may want goggles enclosed safety glasses too. get figure CA? Genuinely curious live AZ born raised WI. come conclusion many citizens won‚Äôt realize true extent covid tears apart city.

Here AZ (specifically Phoenix) epicenter quite weeks, had/have freezer trucks dead bodies, 95% full hospitals one point, sending patients New Mexico avoid overflowing, etc. governor much Trump‚Äôs puppet doesn‚Äôt want much action it. Still statewide mandate, left cities decide.

I unfortunately go back Wisconsin end August funeral, non covid related. hearing people say hoax, go away election, numbers inflated, etc, mention iffy mask wearing, couldn‚Äôt help shake head think city state currently live love heart, sad see numbers sky rocket, hear overworked nurses are, damage businesses. much ignorance displayed little empathy. 

Now people wear masks anywhere go Arizona, seems different kindness respect air. know it‚Äôs joke. (for part)

Okay problem. Good  Thanks. I‚Äôd prefer compare Sweden vs it‚Äôs neighbors much relevant. Sweden 5-10x worse per capita that. Pretty bad  likely moms reluctant come in. You‚Äôre mixing two different problems though. spend buttload money, access really good care. People can‚Äôt afford spend buttload money get bad care worse health outcomes, unfortunately lot people group we‚Äôre great average.

Not saying system overall works right all, shouldn‚Äôt ignore good health outcomes either. comment come that, snarky kind common thread. Good know really feel, thanks. 34 people per square kilometer vs 8300 people per square kilometer.

There's popular misconception people can't get COVID rural areas can't stop COVID urban areas. Singapore get control clearly second proposition false. remaining problem convince rural people actions affect others too. please edit original comment people see it? Become? can't remember last time thought positively future state. 30 years. tested way country, even close.  choice though? Sweden also size US state national free healthcare system citizens, national response, social welfare systems enable people work work home much easier US. 

We could outcome Sweden simply social protections Sweden populous 100 times bigger shear size population density. 

What confuses me, republicans advocating masks keep people hospitals **since make covid related treatment completely free - aka, paid tax dollars incredibly socialist manner**. ya'all advocating personal responsibility pay free care?? teen pregnancy fix infant mortality.

Oh that's definitely big part teen pregnancy tough though go full left right issue?

It's actually hard look data. Full comprehensive sexual education access abortions way lower teen pregnancies. single nation without low rates teen pregnancy. restrictive, common teen pregnancies. 42 FYI heard x-rays really useful large majority people sort back issue may may symptomatic. told though, expert. Theoretically said 10 people feel fine 5 show disc problem something x-ray (I totally making numbers explanation), 10 people back pain 5 also show disc problems x-ray. shows x-ray may may anything what's causing pain since things often cause issue, often types injuries muscles parts back cannot seen x-ray. 

In end, x-ray useful? hard say. treatments done cover wide range injuries without paying x-ray may show anything all. course certain things would caught x-ray, useful, people going helped first diagnostic tool. Also, sort serious accident course important get one, apply case. 

 doctor knows best depends kind pain circumstances surrounding it, also might able find someone willing give generalized treatments help wide range issues without expensive diagnostics know situation.

If ultimately pay type insurance, check finance tips doctor/hospital bills. lot good advice get bills lowered, sometimes significant amount, work payment plans make affordable. billing offices usually flexible people paying pocket health care costs.
*Some* anyway. also personally experienced going doctor cash hand front time insurance, told would see insurance covered plan work with. existing patient different insurance year, thought strange nonsensical. take money front offered patient know reliable? Instead rather fight get paid insurance company?

Wow must extra bored. huge reply comment said almost nothing. need find something do!  Form limited company, employ family directors board meeting drink nibbles. cost 1 billion [not teen pregnancy fix infant mortality.

Dr Ferguson‚Äôs models prove right one time... Similar perhaps, primary source, news linked 3rd hand went:

NHC Xinhua Star

It lacks complete information original NHC report, example original report contains provincial breakdown 10 imported cases (Guangdong 4, Sichuan 3, Tianjin 1, Shandong 1, Henan 1) Star's report whatever reason omits information.

Another example, Star's report terms asymptomatic carriers also reported 15 new asymptomatic cases, also 25 reported day earlier, though China classify symptomless patients confirmed Covid-19 cases.

Where actual NHC report actually much details asymptomatic carrier new asymptomatic carriers (all imported). 3 asymptomatic carriers became confirmed cases yesterday (all imported), 21 released isolation recovered (20 imported). Currently 385 asymptomatic carriers medical isolation (all imported).

Of note 1 21 asymptomatic carrier releases recovered domestic actually important information - last domestic asymptomatic carrier China recovered. Star's editorialised version omits useful information. people suggesting ""just protect vulnerable"" smart none ""just protect vulnerable!!!"" actually well thought-out. know NOTHING new VIRUS... cautious stay SAFE HOME???? going say, first world countries laws allow parents look sick children. can't see moral justification not.

Keep trying, can't let reckless people control conversation. Maybe I'm misspeaking. I'm saying mutation could retain long period zero symptoms, much higher death rate. Parents always done lol. Colds coughs never stopped parents sending kids school. Idk everyone thinks theyll stop thing... I‚Äôll take accidental moron pointlessly rude. call hoax though. internet news. saw eyes. Billions people around world seen calling hoax. everyone thought fucking idiot (except seems around third Americans). Yep. California public pay pension database.

This probably big step 1984 action. That's Fauci said. said recommended masks general public want people hoarding medical professionals needed PPE.

He lied American people one voted him. He's part reason. thought someone posted article morning, apparently even last month, surging mask sales Sweden: bruh, bought 50-pack already August, always said possible recommendation, even like Norway, ""not enforced"". category lies like ""Sweden nothing pandemic"". Fair enough may bit harsh Also time universal affordable childcare. many ways vulnerable US. government basically takes money throws us wolves. even paying social safety net infrastructure shit?

Killing vulnerable population. (but LIVES matter) what? glass beer French fries?? selfish? Stay HOME Belgium!!!!  People always going abuse system regardless like abuse actual system right now. government look majority citizens, businesses, politicians.

No system perfect better others. Let's honest, one best. think western Europe country's better ours. sure California, Victoria taking step further, trying get zero *cases.*

Which seems like good idea virus finds way lockdown repeated every months.  Water wet add much pay equivalent taking suck time year, would bet employer coming way ahead.

These types schemes ultimately contribute injuries disease reason indicate, dont want one ""ruin it"" someone else.

These schemes 100% anti-worker serve employer.

Best luck!

Edit: math. 

At Fed minimum wage, would take 5 weeks sick leave order match 'bonus' $1,400, perfect attendance.

National teacher's salary average according quick Google search $60,000. assuming average work hours year 2,080, means average teacher makes $28/hr. average worker gets 7-8 sick days per year according Dept Labor.

So, would take 50 hours sick time surpass $1,400 bonus. schemes, taking 1 hour sick leave disqualifies one getting bonus, yeah, definitely employer's favor.

Remember, employer care you. employer cares bottom line. read ""Entitled Parents"" E Pluribus Fuck You. Dude, showed thread OP correct Tegnell believed herd immunity beginning April. I'm sorry cannot handle incorrect. Hope get better.

Clearly..... taxes used improve quality life. system broken people starting wake up. mean 700 million seems like enough doses everyone even takes two That‚Äôs good point. 2018 Amazon paid $0 taxes due recent tax legislation passed. laws changed Amazon pay even 15 20 percent corporate tax, country would lot better shape. Wait til Flovid season...apparently flu covid time deadly part. think military spending type social safety net. Sure, LOT LOT LOT waste, lot give 18yr old kids job. Hopefully help transition HS career.

I think would impossible do, would interesting see money spent. much goes salaries, much goes materials, much goes making rich guy richer. Louder people back! What's different execution? Oh No!

Anyways. let question slap across face.

How would explain decline Oklahoma's economy decline oil price? Oh yeah! Merica, right Covid Wedding! Well could pay almost 23% single year Medicare All! right! Obesity, diabetes, renal (kidney) disease, asthma, chronic cardio/respiratory issues, cancer, etc. best represented comorbidities covid deaths. 

In US average age death 79 important tells us majority people died probably far away dying without covid.

The average stay nursing home US prior covid 18 months. move somewhere else, means die there. 

This extremely risk population even best times. usually health issues weakened immune systems. Whatever vaccine available FDA approval next year going fundamentally one still get 5-10 years. decide get it, essentially stalling inevitable eventually getting - importantly, delaying community recovery/herd immunity.

The thing would realistically change vaccines line find ways tweak create powerful immune response (e.g one get might 70% efficacy, perhaps 5 years they'll release one 95% get booster.) Safety-wise though, that's something low bar.

All vaccines pass high safety standard approved, otherwise FDA executives would risk going prison. 60-120 days?! typo? cases exponentially decrease time number susceptible individual decreases new infection subsequent immunity. That's vile, I'm surprised. Science junk journalism fake things super rich Christian fundamentalists agree on. Coincidence? [Missouri governor] Mike Parson postponed event St. Louis Wednesday debate Friday First Lady Teresa Parson tested positive Later Wednesday, brief statement, Parson said also tested positive, awaiting results second test confirm result.

Just July, said ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need government tell wear dang mask,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúIf want wear dang mask, wear mask.‚Äù Wooow I‚Äôm shocked. Well really. kid (up Highschool) mom would send school sick, wait I‚Äôve half-price breakfast Free lunch (so 3 hours) come pick up. often meals I‚Äôd week. 
She didn‚Äôt care I‚Äôd get others sick long could eat. 
Not defending parents, pointing selfishness. Yes, thank clarifying. told directly educators believe black women experience pain. racism. live, would opposite... dreaming people actually wearing masks.  silly exaggeration. blue ridge* would believe amount people know SoCal moved away last 3 months biggest reason always want kids school extra-curriculars. mostly stay-at-home moms want take care kids extra work at-home school. move state avoid losing free time course going want take care sick kid. That's someone else's problem. guessing chance immediate allergic reaction could severe would think chances incredibly low statistically still common enough risk considered. Ahahahahahahahaha!!! LOVE right. Kent #Kexit already happening ""cancelled"" budget Coronavirus... Switch bait switch bait... Nothing see folks, press report tell cba. 

It watered furlough end, extended eat friends BS food voucher tripe again, tax-credit style system low earners. Could freelancer credit, maybe even bonus temp delivery workers I'm split betting also happen, floated idea. 

Clawbacks re-announced hunt fraudulent furlough claims, changes self employed pay tax ' like everyone else' likely. Renewables blather re-announced, possible energy payments chatter bit early those. 

No-longer-free A&amp;E admissions NHS accountable things like overdrinking get stomach pumped / smoking-related disease etc. could make rumoured appearance... highly unlikely even society successfully divided pre-2020 getting far, far easier shove self-policing policy like now. 


Totes bonus points society new care workers get starter bonus 3 months, pay rise like France... non. happen, wishful, social. Anyway, whatever. heard first truth often hides plain sight. Look moron, replied comment using words. Go pick fight somewhere else, I'm interested. smells like agenda

correcting bad info ""agenda against"" person..... RP feels 22% herd immunity entitled feeling. science expert opinion disagree.

That's Fauci saying this.

I'm sure someone find dr Fauci's CORRECT INFO value next time another dummy regurgitates stupid talking points. Lol. Exactly. people morons, ‚Äúcompliance‚Äù isn‚Äôt bad word complying medical advice. Every one us ‚Äúcomplies‚Äù hundreds thousands things throughout lives. asked strain's name problem COVID spreads class sued negligence teachers parents.  r/NotTheOnion material Thalidomide caused birth defects fetuses. Unless someone pregnant wouldn‚Äôt worry based particular example. bad things happen good people shit expect Rand never grew diapers. He's still speweing shit everything around him. LOL act like administration would kind authority. Cute! Funny, exact thing happened mothers school Monday first day back. Thankfully kid tested positive. also thankfully mothers complaints online teaching she‚Äôs looking offer teach online another school hell cares survival rate 99.8% . That's basically within statistical error. Anything else fraud deception support bs narrative Same!  wish knew. idea difficult live Utah. Everyone like principal here. 0. law near almost week nobody caught it. nonetheless, Fauci persisted, saying ‚ÄúPlease, sir, would like able happens Senator Rand time.‚Äù turned Senator Paul said ‚ÄúYou listening director CDC said New York it‚Äôs 22%. believe 22% herd immunity believe you‚Äôre alone that.‚Äù

This ""rand paul"" guy seems think ignorance valid Dr fauci's expertise, least virus gives shit ignorant opinion. I‚Äôm even gonna bother link studies videos. *Ad hominem* retort, either way. 

Have fun sucking Yiannis üòÜ We‚Äôre reducing basic reproduction number, R0, supposed constant.

We‚Äôre reducing effective reproduction number, Rt. Herd immunity still calculated R0 though, behavioral changes temporary. Sorry, cdc lost credibility.. would believe anything comes mean, there's never ""leftover"" cocaine, hear.. Yeah that‚Äôs gonna happen. plan requires 100% compliance bad plan. masculinity frail guy makes seem 50 something, bad That's problem. virus, brain RNA, smarter people. Lock up. It‚Äôs expected since always close-minded people never change beliefs ideas challenged. Ah ok. fear mongering allowed guess matter much time passes infections? worse brain infections (loss smell/taste, brain fog) vs lung vs stomach vs eyes? Two rounds infection says possible, there's enough data yet outcomes. I'm really surprised there's still central database patient records, symptoms outcomes. there's lot data whether subsequent infections harmful unimportant, best put catching bug looooooong possible. gonna around least another 5 years (unless find treatment infected people). district instructed teachers report school even spouse kid positive. state made kind bullshit illegal, I'd pull kid out. Jesus Christ. Maybe sit year children‚Äôs games... Ok ben shapiro explain decline economy Oklahoma drop oil prices?

The nature government irrelevant economy less one dimensional. Wooops I‚Äôm this. Neither us know particular parent sent kids school. may work know. you‚Äôre right, doesn‚Äôt really matter one mom did, parents *will* simply go work.

I think still really upset people finding options send kids school there‚Äôs COVID house. sympathy people feel option, though it‚Äôs still terrible option. based many U.S. downplayed virus, initial reaction mom sent kids school didn‚Äôt think big deal. hadn‚Äôt reached community explore every single option first. complete secret turned school mayhem.

Anyway, thanks helping see another angle. immune system could form complete response

Not doctor double infection? mean, body cleared first virus yet.... OP spamming sub, countless others increase value investments. dig far enough back, see admit much r/wallstreetbets. Opthmalogist. Eye doc school going back person Monday. schools expecting happen? Well get fined kid go school schools running current administration cutting funding schools open back up. Businesses threaten move time seldom call bluffs. given away power wealthy believe tell us business works. Anyway, many US businesses moved overseas even promising to.  Look economies made change start charging business - like cities $15 minimum wages. local economies still ticking along well minor changes, mostly positive low end workers buy stuff new wages. move, would tax foreign entity making money business US. already stash money overseas, without threat additional taxes. That's definitely theme Miami. Vote exactly right.

We power-hungry party cares personal bottom line.

And associate party, good people... year different. choice clear. Oh sod off. People gone back normal spanish flu, go back normal coronavirus. Republicans say socialism mean dictatorship. Two big words confuse small minds. don‚Äôt extreme faith Biden, mostly cabinet advisers Another reason social distancing, masks. Low prevalence, less likely re-infected fashion... Ya know wouldnt blame Fauci trying move somewhere else. bet many countries would like Without trying sound insensitive, rules changed since decided child? plan covid flu strikes child got lice? see alot people children plan child care. 

I first insanely young work odd hours able accommodate school sick days. I'm trying understand finding impossible. means wealthy family fall back on. took forever get ahead believe 22% herd immunity, believe you‚Äôre alone that.
 
interesting.. 22% enough complete herd immunity, implement several restictions reduce Rt, people following health protocol, might enough partial herd immunity generally got first following health protocol (like wearing mask) likely infect others..
 
a simple illustration: need 85% mask wearing control pandemic.. 30% people refuse wear mask.. while, 22% people infected (7% mask wearer, 15% non mask wearer) left 15% non mask wearer without immunity
 
and sweden? still implement several restrictions, complete herd immunity, perhaps never strategy, maybe part it.. everyone mean EVERYONE would wear mask public next three months thing would drop manageable number. it‚Äôs going take long many people careless reckless point. People Asia wearing masks decades now, it‚Äôs big deal. expect, get told go work send kids school. 22% antibodies tweets beyond grave. work today coworker coughing repeatedly 10 feet away me. wearing KN95 mask good seal face. wearing surgical mask. Say sake argument covid positive contagious. think exposed? also 6 feet extended contact, 20 minutes, coughing. 

How concerned be? shit. see coming Politicians listen, talk people grand stand. FFS Nah, I‚Äôm good Lol well assumptions lives. wage slaves enable elite get even richer. enjoy life, friends, fun, anywhere outside work. Work, go home eat sleep back work. 

That's basically US become, people trapped slave labour debt traps. here! lost 33 pounds since March :) Fkn hell Noodles, ever give rest? always good news multiple people vaccine trials. never know trials might end bad work. kind drugs?

Oxford vaccine thus know patient part vaccinated pool. presume 5 severe cases criteria interim analyses FDA etc. review. So, data indicates actual / official Covid death toll underreported, would reasonable assume similar patterns excess deaths occurred countries well.

So, starts generalization concpiracy theories leading wider spread disease. name 3, Chinese created virus (they say debunked, mention another theory, see ""conspiracy"" prefix, virus escaped Wuhan lab studying yerars, wigh known previous incidences). Second one CDC lied hurt Trump (CDC released data Friday danger airborne transmission removed Monday saying error, rephrased CDC lied help Trump). Third one normal anti-vaxer attitude ""big pharma"" mixed currently justified worry global political pressure lack transparency, especially coming Russia China, countries already injecting large populations, ignoring scientific methods peer review phases done.

Read comment missed entire point SUPER GAY.

/S experience universal, especially state state. currently state recklessly led Republican Governor pandemic. leadership telling everyone open shouldn't, I'm surprised things easier go to. live New York every person know pregnant (thankfully they've health babies) since March half many appointments normal.

Thanks clarification. select people Reddit read. I‚Äôm interested kicking dead horse stop everyone else stops saying Sweden success it‚Äôs clear it‚Äôs even close.

We'll vaccines long find way make gymnastics happen.  Well, could possibly go wrong? add obesity mix too. It‚Äôll interesting look back 5-10 years see full statistical breakdown Yes, agreed. But, everyone willing lose income families feed growing pandemic. takes real hero willing lose get slandered time. It‚Äôs easy way right way. reason Covid spreading much already? spreads long time people asymptomatically, kills people randomly primarily pre-existing health issues, mostly lung heart related.

Mutations case likely reduce spread, change deadly is, whether produces symptoms quicker. symptoms continue take 4-14 days produce mutation, selected spread, infected able spread long even feel sick. Kids social nature, hard parents isolate kids.

Tough fight Diagnosis - think demons blood, cocaine it. nah going al capone route canning tax evasion bribes 15 million something. actually pretty common one guy fall disfavor ask discipline inspection department investigate guy. many millionaire made fortunes past decades clean. probably guilty whatever found. reason looking doh might up. Lots goes wrong need months years longer prove viable option? Ethical issue sure around. Fauci!!!!!! Fauci!!!!! video like sports match favorite player intercepted ball made goal! lot industries decimated. keep worrying favorite local museums, know keep afloat. mention business related tourism (hotels, etc). turns letting moderately large number people continue get sick every day -- interest saving economy -- obvious things could done offset (e.g. ramping contact tracing, handing masks people, etc) going destroy economy. Personally, would anything make money talk experience dealing trials country level working direct trial sites. focus 100% patient safety follow protocol. responded message unreported SAE happen, usually mistake. I'm extremely lucky employer takes seriously capability work home. forget sometimes. another perspective, I'm right outside Milwaukee, seen anyone store without mask long time. I'm sure maskless bars though, one since pandemic. sanitizing groceries found exhausting. ""quarantine"" area basement put everything require cold storage. leave anywhere 24 72+ hours since seems virus can't survive surfaces long time. perfect still risk, minimizes risk think. stressful treating groceries like level 4 CDC lab biohazard. support anyone wants sanitize groceries though, harm helps peace mind, not? four metric. Total cases, total deaths, cases per day, deaths per day. is.. put bags away couple days surely anything viral dead arent wastefull. Ya, ethical issue seems like catch 22... sure there‚Äôs absolute risk that‚Äôs nothing sneeze longer go without viable vaccine, people die, full stop. 

When signed trial registry, fully assumed meant sort forced exposure time ok ever got included (I didn‚Äôt).

That's true every field, *especially* education, schools fucking plague warrens even best times. society room society's fucking broken. Ok? many people infected develop neurological complications? percentage? Somewhat, higher cell count, decreases chance infection.

Also combined practices like wearing masks (which even corona), aware population, lack Mega Cities high population density. Thats works. negative evidence something. positive evidence. point attempt draw conclusions might related covid. 

It's illogical faulty say ""because evidence related, can't rule out"". Hahaha dish someone responds back you, report them? üòÇ see game now. Try grow backbone great day. use days course. people really need them. üòò news, Water also wet.

Hmm. already see many recent corona headlines. Stuff like Dr. Offit, recent ""fairytale"" op-ed CNBC. Hmm... could preddict would happen ü§îoh wait! children would conceived pre COVID. Also massive unemployment recessions like experiencing usually lead fewer births, would guess COVID actually cause birth rate go down. gets sick too, less sick flu. produce study somewhere - anywhere - says masks reduce oxygen intake?

Of course - wholly entirely full shit. Entire professions people put 8+ hour workdays wearing N95 masks, none suffering oxygen deprivation.

Being fucking brainwashed orange chimp - ashamed yourself. think mental capacity shame though. imagine tested often, maybe even daily?

However, get sick always bleach. many mayors governors now? one surprised happening

There‚Äôs surprised, there‚Äôs administering justice. take aggressive measures curb pandemic. Fines jail time inappropriate here. annoying part covid political issue US, completely untrue Sweden. left right blocks Sweden basically full agreement cooperating issue. small ice cream shop area re-opened closed week two later customers screaming staff mostly teenagers asked wear mask. There's also standards ""sick"" is, companies abuse excuse firing people taking leave they're ""sick"" enough deserve it. employees afraid taking sick days even they're sick sick days available. That‚Äôs awful. teachers Tampa Bay, FL similarly burdened. donated money Go Fund friend friend kindergarten teacher. wanted air purifier true HEPA filters classroom. teachers almost entirely own. 

I‚Äôve seen loose behavior describe lately. afternoon grocery store, sushi maker making woman‚Äôs lunch mask around neck masked woman watched. world would anyone wanna eat sushi? goal, objective.

Wyoming last state, county live last confirmed cases. actually much longer since I've restaurant, could come many excuses go lol. Working 32 hours week sound like fucking vacation  Parent go work. shock anybody?

This parents saying: *don't get tested*!!!

Then people get pissy take option available them: send kids school, go work, pay bills.

If want parents this, need support $$$ family member tests positive. We're nowhere near this.

Quit surprised option due stupid capitalist culture. agree it... Duh?

If child certainly could afford child care able take time work NOW!!:(

I feel affected. sister pediatrician QUIT job years ago son dying Leukemia, could home him. Ya want talk safety nets. country medical fucking sucks. concluding paragraphs:

 

Whether travel restrictions ultimately pass legal muster, impulse adopt understandable. Early pandemic, states cases wanted keep way. Today, people areas endured crushing losses liberty worry unregulated borders jeopardize hard-won gains controlling Covid-19.

Yet state regional isolationism poor substitute national leadership pandemic response. Even refused suspend Maine‚Äôs travel restrictions, Maine court quoted Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Cardozo‚Äôs admonition *Baldwin v. Seelig*, economic protectionism case, ‚ÄúThe Constitution framed ‚Ä¶ upon theory peoples several states must sink swim together, long run prosperity salvation union division.‚Äù Cardozo‚Äôs plea unity could read today call coordinated, coherent federal response Covid-19 lacking. response might mitigated disparities driving interstate divisions desperation states feel protect one else will. Infectious diseases may recognize political boundaries, disease-control policies certainly do.

Duh, parents get paid ""my kid sick"" leave. there's affordable child care options. stay home mothering rich need incomes rent.

So either give workers enough paid sick leave kids' infections, give every worker affordable child cate, cut housing costs half. body, selfish vaccinate yourself. people immunocompromised elderly can't take vaccine effective vulnerable diseases others decide ""my body choice"". Washington state measels outbreak many selfish people decided vaccinate children.

To honest, seems little weird talking someone collects data make decisions empirically anecdotal experiences. We're scientists, right?

Weird first time, number mild serious second infection. Halloween Masks generally breathing holes, that's problem. think makes sense compare Nordic countries countries overall, mean directly compare them, since still lot differences different starts pandemic. Sweden, 10% population abroad pandemic started get really serious, immigrant population (for reason?) hit much worse others, etc. Netherlands UK might similar starts pandemic Nordic countries. me, still seem like Sweden would ended less deaths measures would implemented *earlier on*, though, like eg. Finland Norway did. But, time tell, guess. can't ramp enough special fabric (melt blown) make them, Feds subsidize companies get kick started so. inhumane unforgivable. Torture name religion.

Karen would locked making sweaters somewhere Northern Alberta like jobless 30's. I'm pretty sure dug emails every public health agency nthe world every single one would email mentioning herd immunity. central concept epidemiology would weird come up. Yeah.

With flu.

Fuck parent's like that. part including Grandma faithfully gets flu shots every year. parents working can't afford another solution, choice ? Source? Conversely, employer stopped tracking sick leave. need it, take it. we're watching kid light cold, maybe try get work done; otherwise, nobody expects hear day two. know what? absorb slight productivity hit, basically evens people happy, huge turnover retraining costs, people infect office illness, etc. I'd say basically even shot productivity, upside everyone happy likes employer. case, when‚Äôs soonest vaccine could possibly come out? totally understand vaccine go americans priority. like UK, German French vaccines go EU first chinese vaccines go chinese citizens first . People get excited fast either. US shown lately screw majorly .... Coronavirus crisis, Boeing 737 max even pharma induced painkiller epidemic ... american, spell automatic success. received enough vaccines, appears quite straightforward. Sanitize, stab, inject. actually leads vaccine discussions, current ones US Phase III trials baseline target 50% effectiveness. Even (and that's big ""if"" given antivaxxers politicization vaccine approval process) everyone gets vaccinated, 50% effectiveness still need masks, distancing, etc. Huh, thought I've heard excuses bad pandemic policies, got there, ""Vietnamese people magic"" new one. Yeah exactly

Especially symptoms looks like cold cold season....so mean almost understand parents too.

This whole fiasco poorly organized probably bandwidth right now, keep mind future. I'm 100% pro universal healthcare, know that's true.

People also sue doctors able ""cure"" finding what's wrong time. That's necessarily doctor's fault, malpractice insurance still goes up. 

What universal healthcare would bring cost everything people feel like needed sue become financially whole again, agree. think would stop fuckery behind malpractice insurance prices. 

I could wrong though, hope am. entirely opinion.


Edit: maybe malpractice law would also absorbed state point would correct. know intricacies behind that. Yeah mean imply virus particles nothing else rather airborne means transmitted air without heavy respiratory droplets. 

I think probably airborne tend assume worst case. Reasonable people probably disagree part. Whether typical primary means transmission mean. Yeah, that's husband calls them. confused first heard it. Johnson &amp; Johnson made millions dollars sale baby powder talc knew caused ovarian cancer didn‚Äôt tell anyone? Johnson &amp; Johnson? ignoring overall cases deaths compared Sweden.

That's great they're talking next September everything planned virus still around then.  becomes multi-year permanent state things, hope arts find way move forward - whether that's acceptance risk masks precautions, or, changing - permanently necessary - way things.

Lol'd vaccine babies. far complex making it, coming someone kids.

The US country little safety nets. top that, many many jobs paid sick leave financial situation many families, cannot afford luxury staying home kids. even factoring many families might seen pay/hour reduction job loss result pandemic government assistance drying many states.

Shitty situation, country caused issue many families really left choice. Sure assholes, many choice. hand, virus would behave differently macro level aerosol transmission common. 

If apply criteria common airborne viruses bacteria, any. fungi would considered airborne. That's huge mistake. 

We know cloth masks useful reducing transmission known respiratory airborne viruses bacteria. Even simple filter stop legionnaires superspreader event. mean, sickness causes called covid 19. going hard time convincing anyone calling ""chinese virus"" harmless technical term deliberately offensive name attempts absolve trump administration responsibility non response. Ah yes, even comparing two. Ppl sure chip shoulders topic. It‚Äôs parents loan. students. Guy back haackin ciggy - masks aren‚Äôt 100% preventative steps *also* need taken. doesn‚Äôt mean masks helpful. Trump:

""Could stark?"" Hold beer. Funny Taiwan isn‚Äôt mentioned.... see parents send sick kids school time. School teachers call midday fever that's fever meds wear off.

My mom teacher exactly word word said. UBI needs come in. provide social safety net protect inhumane practices like telling parent can't take care sick child.

And anyone says can't afford UBI:

1. Tie VAT tax. Consolidate divert social programs. Sprinkle defense spending tax legalized marijuana. There, UBI paid for.

2. paying matter what. kid worker sick, parent stay home, kid getting sent school sick, likely infecting many others. they're staying home falling behind. taking cost spreading around people look at, telling grandchildren foot bill dealing eroding middle-class.  That's Busch Latte, sir could see guess, article clear. Besides, population already believing degree they‚Äôre ignoring measures, can‚Äôt imagine trying scare phantom asymptomatic cases going work. 10 Downing Street needs think something else. want opinion kept drinking lost 20 pounds*! 

*due starting weight training program sticking it. need drink less, though. I‚Äôd like add regular access healthcare pregnancy (as in, general) also effect keeping women generally healthier. Another reason US generally fared poorer pandemic‚Äîalthough certainly reason. example, I'm teacher know many teachers district say things like ""we open school person learning guarantee one death caused COVID spread school sites.""

But like... one ever cared germ factories schools flu season, certainly led deaths every year? get wrong, take virus fairly seriously, worse flu - get teachers see hypocrisy double standard they're saying. Like one could seen coming.. Correct, time school would costlier benefit running nose. learn fine runny nose. major impediment daily life.

Now start adding symptoms get closer staying home. Fever old standard.

Pretty sick thrown prison expressing opinion pandemic handled, Incorrect thoughts must spoken loud. OOoooohhh talk em Saint Americans would absolutely abuse system unfortunately US spends 2 trillion year social safety nets. society without social safety nets, society poorly conceived social safety nets. saying exact number reinfections exceedingly rare. Where's data there's mass reinfection happening? Lol keep trying you‚Äôre bad  Couple things thinking today wanted see people feel it: 

1. [People release stuff like this/agree \(the Paul Offit article front page get mad people stop following precautions. Maybe I'm alone here, feel goalposts continually shifted ""protect hospitals"" ""we need wait vaccine, stay form lockdown"" gone people thought last past summer six months. Now, know much virus, know protect, on. also much clear unlikely hospitals become overburdened patients point, least US since virus seems worked way lot population (remembering infected always 6-24x amount cases recorded). fact people unironically saying NPIs need continue vaccine makes people go, ""Fuck it, I'm waiting whatever powers tell get back living,"" understandably imo. call people selfish whatever done giving crap people reddit social media echo chambers say. comes hard hitter, think necessary honestly. Maybe I'm ""freedumb"" centric good believe governments always try seize power control people, civil resistance stuff like wearing masks social distancing forever needs happen, even vaccine widely available still mask mandates/NPI guidelines place. needs active resistance back normal vaccine comes. 

2. Vaccine. someone help understand people worried vaccine getting approval US election? Let's look realistically. First off, vaccine get approved say month now, likely get emergency use authorization (EUA). exactly change? means MAYBE elderly/infirm frontline health workers get within last week two heading election. changing anyone's feelings they're voting voting point. Plus, feel people consider big pharma company's best interest release something that's safe effective. Imagine releasing public vaccine that's one either those. done, put nicely. also sure everyone FDA CDC willing put tails line EUA something election. again, pharmaceutical company going let approve circulate something work right. 

What guys' thoughts? fan social welfare state. cap health care appointments, paying maximum 130 $ year medical appointments (one appointment 13-30 $/time). Universities free. 6 years study university get grant around 360 $/month, also borrow money/ student finance additional 840 $/month low interest (0,2%)
But everyone Sweden course likes system would instead rather cut taxes privatize much possible. stare laugh wear mask

Great way make kid self-conscious life right bat.

Also, people like Rand Paul never mention Finland even Norway (thankfully Fauci that!) whenever bring Sweden? lockdown, reopened May 3 countries similar freedom movement. 3 economies roughly similar projected GDP losses/gains 2020 2021 respectively. difference Finland Norway nearly amount reported cases/deaths per capita [excess curve looks far worse Sweden too. Sorry can't accept that... Working CDC inherently using SCIENCE protect public health... can't without politicizing deserve responsibility. US passed Sweden excess mortality per 1 million sometime July, US vastly counts Sweden actually negative excess deaths compared COVID.

No, FDA requires actual report. given details, told independent investigation cleared it. That's enough restart US regulations. company pot idea dystopic. Ahh yea, donate days fellow plebes take day they're sick. That's gross. lose money. Bezos made tons money. cheated system rigged corporations take every tax cut loophole can. Although would nice, need virus gone. need get point overwhelm healthcare systems better treat require hospitalization. We've gotten really good later 8 months, much ahead 2021. facts racist I'm sure medical professionals source PPE reputable sources. 

Its *exports* worry me.  lying, domestic flights back 98% normal.

Unless actually believe they're flying empty planes normal keep spewing ""but evidence!"" excuse fail realise intellectually dishonest moment multiple points evidence reinfections single shred evidence immunity lasts even year. ONE SHRED. 



So people keep going emotional optimism bias. Even 50 people confirmed reinfections right now, that's still 5000% people immune even minimum 12 months. Long lasting immunity objectively, empirically LESS evidence reinfection moment time. people keep doubling cope untill wall writing eventually collapses them. Nah, that's doing. never bought bootleg products, good eye buy. nice night asshole. Yet one responsible politicizing them. Streets shops filled people close contact almost 0 masks Imagine colleges afraid things online. type people still use vhs starting think evolution taking place! obviously false understanding statistics. China continue larger triple digit case counts 1.5 billion people even handling pandemic perfectly. post removed propoganda.

I think changed mind yet.  1000x this. Absolutely this. freedumb fighters masks making much harder rest us.  This. People want talk it, gap maternal mortality fact obesity. Exactly this.

Here Mayor McLeod June, mask, social distancing. Probably OP added side effects? I'm Chinese wonderbread loser LMAOO worst part call antivax say well Trump's charge. Trump's one science fucking scientists qualified. 'the current political environment dystopian novel similar parallels.'

I perfectly understand, except wont crap like Handmaids tale like V Vendetta's style government. virus comes people submit government, give freedoms 'safe' mean, cross immunity anti scientific. actually opposite. There's actually plenty evidence goes Fauci saying. anti-covid family members, family member raged complained father shake hand (I met public coincidentally) proceeded call ""disrespectful"" spit nonsense covid hoax that. Like dude, mind business? better learn rules. don't, eaten sleep feel bad kids go school time like this, makes glad graduated way this.

SINFUL EVEN! think Americans ready 2/3rd current wage higher taxes combined cost living currently have.

I think underestimate much family insurance coverage America. coverage alone expensive that‚Äôs insurance. doesn‚Äôt include deductibles, co-pays expenses covered since ‚Äúelective‚Äù necessary. think find way manage without choose living longer dying early. True, they're using atrocities it.  minds, China Han China controlled them... Uighur, Taiwanese, ethnic minorities. Holy crap.

I'd critical vaccine 5.3% people side effects, depending side effects.. explains general populace want go back lockdown probably trigger conflicts definitely corrupt politicians China one big difference people East Asia really afraid viruses.

You right. specific that. lot corruption East Asia, unfortunately corruption Western governments grown point actively compromises livelihood safety citizens. look Trump, Bolsanaro, Johnson. people actively screwing civilians flaunting immunity law. Duhhhhhhhhhh love watching kids get covid, could watch kids get covid day, give s*** kids. -Wayne (kind of) determined Fed. Injecting massive amount cash isnt possible without hyperinflation. decrease purchasing power. Study every banking system increases printing cover spending. Or, many extra boxes sitting around do, kids could make decorate ""Halloween town"" trick treat through.

My grown-up friends thinking Zoom costume party, maybe Halloween ""Secret Santa"" exchange. Exactly. Choices life. winners losers. Yeah, break spine they'd unleash hell upon force go school ""education comes first"". fucking irritates me. mad piece candy calm made habit every year telling figure out. do. want funding pencil whip anyway. policy needs change.  herd Fauci got 95% Paul got 22% Immunology finals college. I'm sitting 22% federal 6% state...and make shit money...and still net like this. really move somewhere like Sweden. Lol ¬øPorque los dos? Hell, people can't take UNPAID sick days without fear losing jobs. People don‚Äôt give fuck anymore...the world become incredibly selfish entitled. 

I‚Äôm hoping second great flood near future. suspicious numbers.  Every time go sub, it‚Äôs obvious many people Reddit don‚Äôt children, mortgages or, lack better term, ‚Äúbig boy‚Äù jobs. problem isn‚Äôt giving vaccine much purposefully giving virus Afterwards. 

No challenge trial ever done without treatment place (like antibiotic anti flu meds). Homelessness vs sending sick kid school.

If chose going work sending sick kid school, quitting/being fired home til eviction, think would send kid school. 

The issues America allowed Corporations far long screw labor workers, expecting 'pull bootstraps'. That's works. also go eat together, left Panera pick order half tables college students eating course without masks Coddling American Mind  Two minutes worth research find BMJ article September '20 contradicts Fauci saying regarding ""If care, care.""
It's shitty message, came straight white house echoed population.
It began ""it miraculously go away"" turned ""it is."" 
Now pretending sake election. think sending sick kids? poor working class stiffs still support fool. much vindication hearts simply care. There's two diseases display simultaneously. might find Metzl's [*Dying interesting. ~~What happened remaining 5.3%?~~ Yeah, I'd willing pay pay left nut surgery right one. I'm Europe, currently social safety nets past working salaried. liked them. know wages much lower it. think Americans ready 2/3rd current wage higher taxes combined cost living currently have. Bullshit. student loans hold right now. know student loans. it? CPS gets involved sent symptomatic kid school? CPS gets involved go work left kid home himself. Pick poison. public schools' funding tied attendance. needs changed. kids' school policy number days miss incredibly strict. couple colds would result ""disciplinary actions"" truancy. Even parents resources keep sick kids home discouraged doing.

I also friend wanted take son school attend state graduation Covid. school told keep longer wanted would qualify sort campus learning option avoid truancy issues. Basically kid miss class time school could get paid. You‚Äôre speaking inequality system affects middle class. is, make $50k qualify nothing free need pay ass medical care. Extremely poor people country don‚Äôt pay medical care. free reduced cost access live decent state. 

I believe need increase access medical care middle class much poor. could also get covid going store buy candy. fucking candy. kids like putting costumes seeing friends costumes seeing Halloween decorations friends. 

Its candy. kids fat fucks. Maybe lazy kid wanted get candy without walking friends. countries ample warning. contradicting warning. saying virus dangerous China pandemic happening back saying fine.

It's much likely countries giving contradictory warning. Even though held declaring pandemic, clearing raise (1) outbreak international concern, (2) H2H transmission possible, (3) transmission possible via droplets/aerosol. informatio came end January.

At time, hiding behind inadequate excuse every great power world robust intelligence agency. There's evidence CIA knew way news got White House sat information. I'd surprise GCHQ British government.

In case, cannot denied Eastern countries outside China even shorter notice imposed even less lockdown restrictions Western countries. yet, outbreak far less severe consistently. Perhaps time really acknowledge countries screwed avoidable manner rather blaming democracy ""lack notice"". Shifting blame going make things better next pandemic.

For reference, here's timeline actions taken WHO. Notice much already known end January. probably went unnoticed people West still busy sneering situation China time politicians want rock stock good news army streets Madrid? Exactly, within 5 mile radius campus I‚Äôm referring campus housing. fact last house family neighborhood still college kids crammed family homes rented to. darkly ironic sub, nothing covid hysteria unquestioned support lockdowns, complaining results lockdowns. ‚ÄúWartime effort.‚Äù AKA massive government takeover lives every American. Fuck noise. shit ton respect admiration. sequencing keep track mutations see strains parts world. 

They sequence small amount covid patients, need to. costly time consuming. 

Now, mutations general large enough different enough make immune different strains. That's one reason scientists optimistic vaccines - get one strain. Immunity one strain give immunity strains. 

So people get reinfected different strains, ALSO able get reinfected strain. reinfections counted ""proven"" reinfections, though, can't tell infection never fully cleared strain. ""prove"" different strains. kid wear mask school? already print money. kids heard school districts near started announcing reopening school year asked work colleagues kids felt it. Literally every single one said care, wanted kids house dealing last 6 months. back up. Navient expects money. might loosened deferment requirements borrowers absolutely required keep paying them.  crazy superior Asians westerners everything cited experts saying fucking know. 

I cited experts. There's 11 one hobby stats topic credentials for.

I'm perfectly qualified basic division. That's happens back people corner tell work whether sick risk able afford rent mortgage. applies sending kids school sick. fuck else can't afford stay home child care already struggling?

A basic income, tenant protections, 100% mask usage couple months would nipped thing mostly bud, would cheaper fallout endure. 

Instead trapped rudderless, leaderless, dead body laden boat careening toward waterfall potentially millions deaths. 

This administration failed us. us. people put power caught cult behavior realize worsening lengthening pain deal continuing support them.

Vote. however pay 30% income tax :) know would be, countries, america among people employed high skilled, salaried jobs. take much sick leave want (obviously would need address seriously prolonged absence). 

Its low skilled, low paying jobs offer minimal benefits parents dont get paid hour present work. surprisingly, COVID impacts lower income families communities far significantly. mean, think would happen? Forcing kids go back school, crowded places, sick kids. Further, think virus hoax first get it, sadly many parents struggling staying healthy. I've trying say even bring fact hospitals California places use surge capacity bad flu seasons like 2017-18. also bring people get flu asymptomatically spread without knowing people risk. Flu kills young people too. spreading someone's school age son daughter? redditors care young lives? Oh they're self righteous saviors ""if saves one life?"" Smells fishy me. course, I'd get downvoted shit past months.

I'm impressed daily threads sub. People pretty reasonable here. Spanish people pretty mad it, last heard. course everyone forgot already.

Imagine outrage call 1918 flu Kansas Flu starting tomorrow. named river specifically associated place first identified.  nobody could ever seen coming. Sorry bring bad news antibodies 3 weeks virus, herd immunity. called friend today working lab antibody tests. already working vaccine works 3 weeks!! 32 hours week parents think I‚Äôm lazy

Or job needs 32 hours work week...? jesus fucking christ

I mean fuck could cut ***entire*** software development industry's work week 40 30 hours literally nothing would change. We'd crunch gotta crunch coast coast... like we'd go home 2 hours earlier non-crunch days maybe, y'know, happier healthier people hobbies families n' shit.  Essential Worker=SLAVE...no two ways killed vulnerable, strong survive!

Edit: better add /s. Mostly stop the, ""what family member"" replies. arguing that, agree you. Thank you. 2020 truly unkind us, trying frame things best way possible. Truly appreciate well wishes, wish best well :) mean kinda also ignoring shitty leadership people like maduro chavez. combination factors. let's even pretend like socialism means strong arm dictator gives favors buddies ""nationalizes"" industries putting buddies charge. US embargos/shit cold War era policy + shitty leadership sunk country. Also Venezuelan oil lower quality oil found Saudi Arabia, profitable extract price drops certain point economy fell country well. I'm currently hard time watching experts bring news, sides political isle. One side seems catastrophize pandemic side absolutely downplays it.

All said, Medical Doctors come tell people ""I know people getting fatigued, cannot get complacent"" show reminder mental health experts. anxiety say certainty simple lot people. 

Why seeing media public outlets compare contrast data? Right get data related COVID (which really, really important pandemic), social, economic, mental impacts? hear online international vaccine projects halted due Pandemic raising concerns potential return things like polio measles due lack vaccinations administered? fact people going doctor due fear.

Other diseases Public Health risks go away Pandemic.

Science supposed looking issue, coming hypothesis, testing it, releasing data, discourse data, coming conclusions. I'm seeing many people, freaking sides political spectrum, actively trying shut ignore data agree value perceptions going on.

The multi-part discussion question this: 

1. COVID bad ok risk pandemics, risk increase poverty/inequality, deprioritize Public Health issues one thing?
2. make pandemic without making problems worse? (Nothing done, done vacuum)
3. even possible ""Do harm"" Pandemic scale?  
It seems like measures necessary places cannot done without sort harm people measure becomes ""What causes least amount harm greater population?"" Navient definitely expects money. three months healthcare, US would lower per-capita healthcare cost Switzerland. fun compared self administered ones lol crawl mountain broken glass again

Me too, reluctantly I'll ever crawl broken glass. especially funny coming group people lambasted conservatives every turn anti-science anti-vax years anti-vax 'stock price pumping' 'rushed vaccines' simply think president controls every aspect vaccine approval (when five minutes reading would tell rigorous vaccine approvals are).

In honesty though, hurt try. 

Canada nice place, even though feels like everyone heads far asses kiss lungs, still pretty good, coming US find lot familiarity (drive side road, money pretty close, globally speaking course, English primary language, etc) there's obvious differences, course, can't see much ""barrier"".

My suggestion would shop around work field, start talking companies now, let know like work soon graduate something along lines. Also, position move different country, I'd look eastern European countries, like Iceland, Finland, Norway, Sweden, etc. pretty good governments rules. guess winter years, though. Africa young population.

The average age death covid 79.

It much less dangerous younger people. Yep.
 extra hard though multiple kids take turns getting sick household, though. Could end needing better part month off. product coal miner/coal baron mentality existed WV beginning. People like Justice get rich exploiting poor workers simultaneously convincing need him, way around. compare systems public schools use all, least experience. kids miss day school get marked absent long absences approach truency levels (25+ days semester so) there's nothing worry about. Sailors flat show work said sick refuse go medical getting written UA likely explaining commanding officer supervisor told do. [Vitamin increase vitamin level. üòÄ

Also, paper talked post. would decent number tests conducted?
100 million? 200? 500? Lol ‚ÄòMurica, ‚ÄòRona ain‚Äôt ready drones armour I'm leaning way go this. Particularly considering limits vaccine.  Simple precautions like masks make us safer mandatory.  Otherwise, dangerous world now.  I'm ready accept that, rather putting one single finite life vague hope complete return normal indefinite point future may may ever come. I'm willing months, years. HIPAA also applies healthcare organizations business associates. means lab testing company needs signed release disclose COVID-positive status anyone. people read it, handed one releases almost every time receive medical care asked sign it. to, may need go extra paperwork get results providers involved care.

Schools (or anyone) ask symptoms, HIPAA bearing this. Schools may subject privacy laws (FERPA), anyone tells can't ask medical conditions HIPAA full shit. urban myth like ""a undercover cop can't lie say they're cop."" Chinese? really we, Americans, people are, we're punishment oriented. studies 50s demonstrated humanity's spiteful nature. redid decades later international participants found us mean, selfish, spiteful ass Americans. 

We lot potentially right we're worst. let know hit 3rd time's think, stressful situation even possible parent consistent daytime work schedule! lot jobs (and I'd wager majority essential services) use rotating shifts... meaning one parent could already working days, evenings, overnights weekends unpredictable schedule. second parent would need equally variable (but much accommodating) work schedule order ensure kids cared for/attended necessary. confirm, well paid job, fair amount time (4-5 weeks rolled together), sit straight, come work! Luckily usually enough empty spaces sick people isolate (prepandemic, home now), bad. fairly stupid system togethe.r Denmark's worse Sweden.

Denmark new daily cases, metrics worse. work gave us additional 10 days Emergency time needed child elder care; actual test positive they, manager district manager sign it. 

If test positive given paid leave. sure exactly paid leave falls under, something like short term disability 

I work major US bank, take care us, still blows You‚Äôre thinking risking kids lives get candy tells lot character. cheap don‚Äôt care kids. lockdown US. Restrictions, yes, lockdown. Economic activity never went 50%. Sports everything WV. Like 10 years ago high school tore floors renovate, decided needed redo football field more, didnt floors like two years. absolutely is. IM leg, monkey could it.

Problem application, actually verifying people it. bet ton would thrown people would lie taken it. Yes, unless combined host reforms like rent control, utility control, etc... like sticking bandaid bandaid bullet wound. May hold back blood little bit, always come out. also hard virus presents many symptoms. COVID firs symptom headache. went work, headache. Looking back, actually head congestion even symptoms progressed really felt like sinus infection/typical cold. 

It would difficult keep kid home runny nose one time temp 99.9 wife months back waiting get tested due possible Covid exposure. We‚Äôre sitting lobby mom comes daughter. overheard say getting tested parent daughter‚Äôs school brought kid school even though kid TESTED POSITIVE Covid. 
Parents give kids Advil reduce fevers school, definitely parents hiding positive Covid results. sympathy people purposefully got pregnant. PANDEMIC, morons. Way use medical supplies, it. sending message. always follow examples feminists karens. Yeah shit Isnt fucking homicide?

‚ÄúGo school, one know killed grandma‚Äù dad dies, plan telling debt collectors call fuck off. won‚Äôt much estate unless writes will, decent car house isn‚Äôt worth much. 

If want fight it, old house I‚Äôm attached it. Look goalpost moving breakneck speed Denmark's worse Sweden. Add excess deaths it‚Äôs approx 250k. wait till kid dies parents flip blame school spot analysis. Good luck studying gain function/loss function middle pandemic spawned disease solid treatments cures. supposed show that? Sequence genomes every infected person analyze clinical notes? big problem genetic differences patients along comorbidities.

There way directly show virus gets less deadly, see behavior modeled viruses, misinformation all.

What would misinformation ignore data viruses evolution, say ""The virus not/will get less deadly proliferates."" That's kind bad faith argument. way prove intentions thousands parents, let alone ""*each* parent who's intentionally sending sick kid..."". opinion. fact use name calling ""Win"" argument sure says lot character. airborne dont. Masks help droplet airborne. airborne need Papprs negative flow homes. outside events all. fucked deaths going 10,000% Um wartime efforts don‚Äôt last forever. Duh! virus contained vaccine things would rolled back. There‚Äôs precedents place guide process. Stop dramatic. Last checked rationing ended WW II well mass manufacturing war front.

We needed leadership top down. would‚Äôve allowed mass mask distribution, streamlined testing contract tracing well mandates far schools concerned. every state thing effective solution. It‚Äôs funny think lives aren‚Äôt already controlled extent. cellphone? Last checked means constantly tracked. whatever. 

They surmised things place many people wouldn‚Äôt died. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm alone saying don‚Äôt mind temporarily inconvenienced save lives others. right. I'm behind couple weeks. sucks. guy‚Äôs posts... terribly sad. Venezuela beautiful country lovely people. wish things stable there. would love visit. people deserve much more. bummed. friend (56F) (55F) trick-or-treated last years, total hoot! (We short, wear full face masks. one person suspected us far!) 


This year going come trick play. Yeah, that's thing. lots places better simply choose they're stuck past dumbass operations can't/won't figure out.

So many people (especially ops, experience) simply refuse change anything that's know even though alternatives end better adjustment time. I'll never understand it, personally, ops manager. would things improve company employees business work end *temporarily*? Tell person lie company say moved back parents/GF/BF/sibling/cat/whatever. Wtf on? Lol Well, that‚Äôs happens open schools back up. 

Those mask wearers don‚Äôt give fuck anything send kids school sick not. Crippling endangering take virus seriously families. Thanks admitting take Denmark 11 years catch number deaths Sweden. billions spent sending cameras space take pretty pictures samples foreign objects order find origin life.... life happening now. forgot mention days count dentist visits, physicals, etc. even perfectly healthy family would exhaust those, I've never seen perfectly healthy kids. /s gotchu homie okay though, many infections expected, absolutely danger. /s

Because things operate step functions instead exponential curves, guess. surprising all. People sick days people cannot afford allowed unpaid days. job two years ago almost fired took sick day two months starting. husband town infant fever go daycare. policy took two days sick time row required apply FMLA. incredibly stressed anytime daughter got slightest sniffle knew sick day would major deal. perfect solution. know jobs can't it, lot get better. office job able something like though even modified. 

For much like ability take days needed company sent email stating works bringing us back office. Literally meeting past six months best company seen $$$ wise. employees broken personal goals Yada Yada. I'm like why? We're good, want comradrie back team building. I'm like, literally go office shut doors interact teams anyways. break what's working. Especially weird uncertain time. People sick literally keep working home taking days unless absolutely worries. 

It's argument could last lifetime. frustrating many aspects right across board.

That also semi rant lol. Venezuela got destroyed evrey government had, neo-liberal capitalists, facists, socalists, failed diversify economy away relying petroleum.

The socalist government built alot anti poverty programs oil revenue.

When revenue collasped, Venezuela could float credit, crumbled.

It's socalism destroyed Venezuela, anymore captalism destroyed Russia's economy.

It's reliance volatile commodity so, almost entire placebo group? Awesome didn‚Äôt know that! control yourself. It‚Äôs time get grips Ok let rephrase that, would employers differentiate abusing system staying home feigning sick versus someone single parent 3 kids got sick twice throughout month causing employee need use 6-8 sick days month. 

It's nuanced question I'm getting at. It‚Äôs depressing :( Well. 1 party may open it. 1 would fight tooth nail against. People bootstraps right? need social safety net top that. Dozens them! don‚Äôt understand. disability referring to? shit? Lol bruh suck trying spread fascism disinformation Sure, mom worked banquets, stuff coukd done weekends nights. worked mom, made dinner, made sure stuff got done quiet. 11 moron? Considering immensely successful software projects done entirely remote online, absolutely. really isnt groundbreaking news. We've known mutation months now. easily spreadable, deadly.

Then, didn‚Äôt think needed another ultrasound 20w one 10w due complications SCH. able push get another ultrasound 13w anyways, important since normally people announce healthy baby! Also, wanted ensure SCH longer doubling size higher risk normal pregnancy.

Honestly, might better finding another OBGYN office, easier said done. Luckily, one virtual appointment option chose wasn‚Äôt emergency.

You're correct timing crucial. Here's good, short video that: 

[Coronavirus: lost six weeks US failed contain outbreak - BBC facts correct, Tennessee locked April 1st, stayed lockdown month, reopened May 1st -- [and remained open ever seems case many southern states heavily-dependent tourist dollars (e.g., Tennessee needs open Nashville). 17 Tennessee counties (out 95 -- that's 18%, less 1-in-5) mask mandate.

Something people across pond may aware of: people UK EU able stay home government(s) paying stay home. [80 -90% people's deposited bank accounts every month can't work home (e.g., people service sector).

As bad: everyone already cited that, repeating. Nothing wrong m4a 80/20 split thing referred m4a current system prices exorbitantly high people without health insurance get enough squeak insurance companies discounts.. paying 20 percent like 50

Yes exactly. wonder mentioned media like others. Well go live China. love much. I'm sure able live freely üôÑ getting way close children men hell goes trick'or'treating middle pandemic

oooh right, United States, go ""full stupid"" nevermind don‚Äôt understand aversion wearing one help can‚Äôt hurt.

Tell Spain France, two countries Europe rely heavily heavily masks try beat virus using masks. 

My worry this: 

People tired pandemic mandate masks people may say ‚Äúok, wear mask, thats it. won‚Äôt work home anymore since wear mask symptoms won‚Äôt stop going work Ort party friends either‚Äù

The net effect may actually negative. suspect that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening Spain France right now. Why? 0 risk going day care, shut immediately testing positive. What's lawsuit going get anyone? Oh? ""some saying?""

Some also saying go jump ass. Handmaid's Tale. reason Handmaids. many babies stillborn (although scenario, many bizarre birth defects too). Also balance individual rights vs common good. Chinese culture heavily slanted towards common good. Friend problems birth, kid lifelong probs due lack oxygen, family financial stress huge debt (no insurance, lost job downturn) time huge emotional family stress. sell house, change school districts, added stress. Obamacare got job insurance felt couldn‚Äôt leave, feared losing insurance families ‚Äòpre-existing conditions‚Äô. kid needed LOTS care one-income family, couldn‚Äôt hopscotch insurance coverage spouses. Even insurance annual bills ridiculous. fund raisers try help pay care. time trying dealing serious stuff, also worry financial ruin. many people think safe, health care problem ‚Äòhave nots‚Äô. don‚Äôt know thin ice is, easy end underwater. whole republic needs reboot point... r/TechnicallyCorrect SEND DIKS PLZ Well, interested article subscription pop took 90% screen banner top page took another 8%.

This wholly incorrect, unless live major city. America huge shit-ton us live rural areas. Places without grocery stores hospitals even emergency services. sister respiratory therapist Portland, part transport team. drive 4 hours away pick kids less equipped hospitals, sometimes taking helicopter plane urgent. even talking hour minimum. Portland, situated West Coast Seattle north, Salem South Major cities like SLC West. Nebraska Wyoming? rural health system America dying for-profit model health care. 

In America, black brown exacerbates issues well. failing birthing people America, failing black brown women. Interesting.

And see shying away standing weakness, like US (ex. ""sheeple"")? Fall winter pretty. Everyone spring thinking immune, discovering immune. literally effects nobody. 

Trump 2020. Minus candy part I""m health nut. That's usually Halloween even bother celebrate it. think commenter meant say someone knows airlifted hospital via helicopter. emergency flight, person required several units blood. need home, accurate EPT type Covid test. Self administer daily ir couple times week. that's comparing apples oranges. single private hospital might well better single state run hospital, determine ""better""? might shinier equipment run expensive battery tests, mean doctors working automatically best informed every single aspect healthcare. US' appalling infant mortality rate fact, despite lauded benefits for-profit healthcare people assume money = better. FYI article US. I'm little fat girl deaf hard hearing? pretty big deal us. hear/read stupidest statement, assume it. sucks much.

I remember saving every year get flu shot, like saved new glasses (get blinder every year) car taxes. young thought invincible, caught flu, totally unable work week half, started cycle late bills, late fees, penalties lasted months.

And it‚Äôs told uninsured people personally know cover pocket cost need help paying flu covid vaccine. Two friends, third family. Simple take.

I find odd take people around place me. people around sound like great many manual workers know states.

The effective way counter insurgencies take away problems lead someone pick arms. look units success pacifying Anbar political empowerment, economic stability, using locals security security duties. also reference explosion daesh (IS) region taken away. 

My experiences led becoming incredibly strong supporter Syrian Democratic Council basis revolution banner ‚Äúecology, feminism, democracy‚Äù. Desertification huge factor leads instability Iraq Syria. Fuck Syrian Democratic Forces though, right? Bunch people right head guess.

So, taking people around reflecting me? highly doubt intelligence analysts, field produces defectors, ya dip. People brush disease getting it, understand long term effects adults children new **novel** virus. think he's saying friend air-lifted accident also received blood, helicopter used get blood hospital. health care system fucked, sister law 6 months pregnant nephew insurance falling one three major healthcare providers Midwestern city billing differences, required go completely different healthcare system finish pregnancy birth!

You‚Äôre amazing, intuitively knew needed. blue one please. Agreed. States can‚Äôt access money like feds. needed federal response.

I think law suits fail though. really need better guidelines Halloween. Right general bits info. 

Halloween going happen year across United States parents use realistic guidance way safely. 

We need fragmented piecemeal bits information do. need comprehensive guidance starting assumption kids going knock doors people candy answer. understand needs published means conveying information. long term effects COVID. long term effects short-sighted response COVID. Honestly-get kid big bag candy CVS call month Today day weekly cross check death register result extra reported deaths people died positive COVID-19 test within 30 days death.

Lol schools nurses anymore. aren‚Äôt safe. makes stomach hurt. Lots people gone without care need.

Cool, look forward reading news article poor fate befell receive it. Fact remains coronavirus type cancer imply medical breakthroughs happening speed cancer/a cancer research laughably uninformed take.

With almost doctorate aware that. one pro-Sweden revisionists.

I see I'm wasting time. It'll go away vaccines get approved. Maybe late october. /s disagree. live Illinois, spending lot time vacation property family Wisconsin. least suburbs spend lot time in, generally taken seriously. Green Bay area, not. didn't. every country measures stillbirths same. baby born half kilogram dies 5 days later, countries count stillbirth, count live birth followed infant mortality. goggles required point will. I'm saying yet see anyone wearing point. fight get people wear mask. dont see going along goggles would. EU, China, U.S. Canada, Russia still going hoard vaccines get people vaccinated first leave poorer countries behind, it'll help speed process year? every day!

Pervert may asshole opinion care feel must civic duty best country.That difference Canadian asshole American one.Stay safe. 200 nations world, Sweden top 10.

Sweden even top 10 look official Numbers. since countries count deaths Sweden actually counts (see link above) officially reported numbers useless compare countries. 

The metric comparable excess deaths Sweden falls quite bit ranking. pretty lightweight lockdowns though. give people vaccine purposely expose coronavirus might true two months ago. 

Price masks gone lot recently. [Look 
Specifically pages 31 - 32.
 
The initial vaccine question asked is:
 likely, all, get first generation COVID-19 vaccine, soon it‚Äôs available?
 
While may certainly never get vaccine (the survey indicates 23% get vaccine all), may also understand able get vaccine ""*as soon available*"" given limited resources likely prioritization recipients.
 
My $0.02 vaccine proven effective people begin receive it, people come board. Good. literally need people Earth ""You can't order businesses close provide financial support.""

Pretty much this. states can't print money really even borrow it. failure feds. know people want vilify establishments, really choice. Yes, structure economy infinitely important lives people. always functioning society, even people working asses keep society running dead! /s Oh mean dumb people poor states less likely take serious?

Checking Oklahoma, confirm. put N95 mask Boba Fett helmet? Every year? every day! say permanent? government supply manufacturer provider. watched briefings March, know that. government work car manufacturers get help mask producers, which, BTW, news sources follow made fun (""why pillow guy making masks!!!! Ree!"").  mask shortage last long all, maybe 2-3 weeks. 

200K died. 80-90+ COPD heart conditions diabetes, follow state's dashboard briefings see that.

2.2M people die year. Yes, tragic ""Trump bad"" whatever point trying make? Maybe something pro-lockdown?

I live epicenter still deaths USA, despite 100% mask compliance way order pretty draconian lockdown. anyone knows analyze data asking ""gee (very old) people died despite this"" ""gee, work let's it!"" Besides said aboved, maybe Vitamin D? thought. wonder means see data earlier trial. think Moderna Pfizer gave wait second dose start determining efficacy. Either way great news. Yep. Every year get obscene amount people coming sick office because, ‚ÄúWell, wanted save PTO vacation, I‚Äôm really *that* sick right now.‚Äù

I hate it. happens every single year spite company telling everyone half-assed, ‚ÄúPlease stay home ill,‚Äù gets everyone else sick. ""american"" parents normally do.

Because america fucked. Differences like comparisons US Sweden wrt. COVID response policies really valid. Sweden's approach, good bad, also emphasizes personal responsibility public messaging. US, seems like half country gleefully celebrating fact take responsibility actions nobody else going hold accountable either, attitude directly encouraged political leaders.

In short, Americans often make best bad choices, often make bad choices intentionally. That's good combination government ""delegating"" responsibility stopping COVID people. Lol im gonna honest. didnt even think till said it. limited view situation, I'll charitable explain statement flawed. yes, American populace mostly moderate also apolitical, comparably still right leaning compared first world countries. 

Voter turnout solely national election floats citizens, state 40% using source, leaving unimaginably abysmal participation local. portrayed huge mess media everyone busy 9-5 jobs, families, hobbies, sleeping eating focus something like that. get majority uninformed voters, identify party sides economic situation maybe singular issue that's prominent life.

Also, we're taught certain way education ultimately skews views, like regarding nationalism, praise flag every morning school taught we're greatest country world huge army boasting economy. hard work acquire American dream, basically creating idea impoverished blame, lack social safety nets, equal opportunities, familial wealth. Something like 9/11 made sound devastating books, was, extent able used promote islamaphobia propagate wars citizens nothing besides ""national security"".

Nonetheless, can't personally blame current populace office, we're intentionally made think vote certain way, go extra miles civic duties rarely rewarded informed minority. Millennials every newer generation greater wealth knowledge learn due internet age, hopefully take country back next decade so. Fuck Minorities? ..... yeah.... uh.. ok... Anyone would advance argument like that, would strike someone truly care art form always existed. God knows, plenty those. think threshold COVID ""not existing."" ever considered realistic goal? think threshold people able populate crowded space without fear ending ventilator.....that much attainable, believe, attainable development vaccine. cannot allow end high culture, truly much reason keep living life. Might well throw 2% work force, die covid, grinder hung keeping meat cheap plentiful. vast difference citing transmission trends citing ""wave neurological consequences"". weeks ago child kept home symptomatic. took get tested got results next day. Upon notifying school results, child's school said send sick child displaying symptoms COVID test came back negative. Even schools say send in. That's great, hope transmission low among kids. Especially younger need class get much school experience. 

I consider conclusive yet though. Sometimes virus sneaky. ""bUt ThAtS CoMuNiSm""

actually socialism - american use words like slurs wonder whole social system fucked many levels. little piece data would change discussion ‚Äúthis someone else‚Äôs fault need fix it‚Äù ‚Äúthis fault need fix it‚Äù. makes absolutely sense me. course are, going babysit kids? *everyone goes surgeon nurse match mask* realize school kids young 5? Would actually leave 5 year old home alone? yeah. pre-pandemic. family friend told us group kids attended birthday party literally every one tested positive notified school, school told going anything happened ""off school grounds"". Umm, kids coming back class infected. Yes, odds high nothing happen, even one kid who's higher risk gets sick dies, then? 

The school went graduating class 250, even one student teacher died year, everything came grinding hault. HUGE deal, understandably so. approaching ""meh, kids die, happens"". work? company would go bankrupt paying people nothing. might anyway work shit ton. work startup. 

If government covered cost, would still hire. 120 days off???? jobs people like have? Bird watching?

It's wonder Europe paying China 5G USA everything else. Silicon Valley could never happen Europe. survive someone gets sick, you‚Äôre destroyed. joe rogan become fucking hack, feel dumb wasting bunch years listening him

he pushes pseudoscience misinformation excuse that

i respect love fight commentater IT.

Fuck joe rogan bullshit spreads audience ""If wasnt news would even know covid exists?"" remember hearing one lot began parents ain't $hit! Sending back pandemic, top that, sending sick kids in? pandemic STRUGGLE many levels ultimately dying killing people. US corporate- friendly corporations hide profits overseas? 
The kind 'socialism' people ok military protection, reason think defending us disease actually attack kill millions americans year worthy, trillions defending us terrorists kill... dozens? americans year, worth it. US work company 51-500 employees $200/day 1/2 pay, 90 days. 

FMLA-FFCRA

It‚Äôs limited don‚Äôt know anyone used except me. company may furious it, nice cautious since came back hardly feel boxing waiting 2021 fire me.  Yes sucks fellow countrymen would rather nothing risk .01% people abusing system. Still better getting COVID. I‚Äôd happy take vaccine. Thank volunteer part effort solve problem. Unfortunately, excess deaths indicates number 10-30% low.  now? Yes, get specific testing company wanted. I'm sure endgame (current administration probably isn't/wasn't time either...), low-grade crude comes Venezuela. we've probably reached peak oil consumption prices oil historically low year. Unless disaster happens causes crude prices shoot roof, oil Venezuela going decrease value even worth pumping (probably 20+ years now).

Not caused socialism, (directly) caused oil - Venezuela's problems stem 2 solid decades mismanagement, authoritarian leaders, corruption. Jokes you, google facebook already via phone. 
EDIT: /s They‚Äôre one largest aerospace defense manufactures around. make engines avionics, Beech Hawker manufactures small mid-size commercial aircraft. safety net works needs done, deadlines need met meetings attended. still lot pressure show work even kids 100%.

It's like safety net magically ensures everyone feeling ill home. That's said though. said fevers nonexistent kid wakes get worse day goes on. Kids might feel perfectly fine first thing morning. Thank you, necessary. mean, wasnt expected schools opened? SMH Yeah systems place provide similar function? Pretty sure dutch coworker mentioned

 literally left job early this. fiance gotten internship assignment leaving July regardless already knew. However start issue, boss refused take seriously follow CDC AVMA guidelines. multiple attempts get take seriously implement proper procedures, told longer felt safe work would coming fixed it. ended done job months early. 

I also mention immunocompromised autoimmune disease. peoples purposeful stupidity astounding. wife's school family went NYC planned vacation march. Came back kid stayed 1 day ""cold"" covid19 symptoms. Next day kid back mom comes talk teachers.

A week later mom casually mentions reply email husband confirmed covid19 teachers met got well.

Yes, getting paid something also benefits average citizen instead? sounds really great me. plan 1,312 beautiful cats retire almost economic system brutal educational system underfunded parents treat educational system tax funded daycare. think it‚Äôs actual smart them, don‚Äôt see would stop paying attention cases, general public time goes people become complacent lax lead less people going get tested voluntarily doesn‚Äôt enter mind much. Whether test though, needing go hospital hard miss accurate gauge state pandemic even though it‚Äôs lagging indicator move forward interview? there's cases mothers charged jailed truancy kept kids home school avoid virus. US cruelly fuck many people possible, literally choice parents. 

Imagine poor mom *fucking sophie's choice* sending kid school get virus, bring back kill incapacitate saddle half million dollars bills...... keep home get sent jail, destroying life child's life might never see again? Well yes, think point. Sweden's numbers sure bad, least seem correct unlike Spain's. number excess deaths number Covid deaths add up. I'll take, ""Things people functional brains saw coming"" 200, Alex.  Hardly surprising. One mother's first grade students told lesson ""I secret mustnt tell you!"" course mother asked secret girl said mustnt tell mother. mom kept coaxing finally revealed secret: lifted sweater reveal red markings belly said ""I got chicken pox!"" 

Piece shit mother sent daughter school despite knowing chicken pox. sorry happened glad went symptoms - indication preeclampsia. see FAR many women whose concerns ‚Äúpoo poo‚Äôd‚Äù - something I‚Äôve noticed far pandemic. continue pregnancy, please remember say medical care. concerns valid - even concern turns nothing, job medical professionals look it. something doesn‚Äôt feel right, things happening don‚Äôt seem right - please please please speak up. 

Don‚Äôt afraid proverbial squeaky wheel. blunt OB say exactly saying - VALID! Put spot say would like noted chart request denied reason behind it. Sadly, many doctors tend act fear litigation. I‚Äôve serious concern preemie isn‚Äôt taken seriously, always ask neonatologist either put order saying ‚Äúxyz bad viral sign ok‚Äù mention putting response note. Thankfully happened 2x career (as work superb neos) times changed tune addressed issue. 

Lastly, good luck home stretch pregnancy!! Wishing happy, healthy baby! üíú someone got injured nurse out, basically comes ""lol gotten injured Wednesday"". sent home instead. others full. Employers take care employees usually happier, productive workers. I'll waiting USA's apology letter situation ""is never going bad Italy"" similar comparisons. call bullshit this. Parents sent sick kids school pandemic sure anyone thought would change after. Well, friend, word 'you' taken general, case here.

Why defensive none applies you? seems like small number.

If re-opening schools tens millions young adults 3,000 extra cases day, seems completely worth it.

Over course school year, that's one million cases perspectives would worth deal online learning.

Fucking moron. one knows advance kids (or faculty) vulnerable.

Respectfully, it‚Äôs paranoia. It‚Äôs understanding risk low, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs low others aren‚Äôt ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù. Wow, red line dropping. 


Not surprising lowest line graph, seems buying Dear Leaders Warp Speed garbage. Personally identified risks would pretty high take vaccine. significant proportion income physically present different places around world benefit could resume work, would take regardless.

My wife front-line NHS would also take offered vaccine meant get infected (again) could continue job.

The tricky part would identified risk group e.g. previously infected suffered COVID induced asthma (which did) NoMoreCOVID^(TM) vaccine 5% chance making permanently asthmatic, would weigh risk getting paid.

Without knowing risks way making call right now. Man I'm hoping mask thing might actually somewhat enter culture this. would prefer wear mask flu season (or least people make office sound like hospital ward) I'd also like wear one go I'm feeling weather.

Personally, like results wearing mask. cold since February. probably continue wearing them, least certain public situations. vaccines widespread, stop judging people decide wear them. point, longer care.

There many instances people thinking reinfected. Moreover, one infections large chance asymptomatic, many many instances people reinfected know. 

Finally, become common time immunity wears off. 6 months large numbers people started getting infected, remember. hospitalization number seems really low me. state currently ~16000 people active infections, I‚Äôd expect way 474 hospitalized. I‚Äôm moving Sweden sounds like care Thank research scientists. hope rewarded fairly long hours putting in. heard Sweden aiming numbers like that. article 2019 says airborne virus like Measles, requires 95% population vaccinated reach R0 immunity, depends ability specific virus reproduce.

People lives still go on. 6.6% death rate (Sweden) better 2.9% death rate (US)? make quick calculation based total cases vs death alone getting anything complicated. Even look death per millions, Sweden 581 vs US 606 much different. like Fauci said, different size populations can't compare apple orange. number total cases, exponential growth come play. Yes, many ppl birdwatchers here. built strong economy :) Yeah neighbor tackled yard clippings figured story. happy European things still money here. still pressured perform hard work. sick days paid leave need work hard order keep job able pay mortgage kids' education. nice long term unemployment benefits mean sell home car... even aiming for. west's propaganda ran story ""herd immunity"" reality never possibility naturally, need vaccine.

Forcing parents make decision whether jeopardize employment keeping child home school gambling community impact sending child exposed COVID-19 school crappy situation around.

We can't continue ask parents put position can't ask educators put position either. governments failing us. Miserably. #notmypresident USA work culture utterly fucked "" virus causing chaos, according data, grabs holds exactly molecule‚Äîbasically disarming much body's defences."" 

If scream man made virus, know does... goddam dumbbell. Yes generally accepted practice school year. Student attendance driving factor district funding. Good thing they're counting WVUs quarantined students one case! /s prevent 80% total deaths, therefore, shielding would cover many categories, including five currently treated moderate risk, comprising 30% population, rather current 2.5% currently shielded.

This ""protect vulnerable"" really means ""let vulnerable fend rest us endanger them."" expats compliance now, [those work passes revoked permanently banned working 
They similarly harsh non-compliant local businesses. 
I think message pretty clear: ""if put thousands lives risk idiotic shit, going get stupid smacked you."" much discourse around opening schools focused getting parents back work...this always going happen. ability see thats child needs. swear come across many people think nurse simply entails passing med taking vitals. ass showing. fine though.

We've closed pubs 10pm made sure 18's play sports indoors. Also, got tell 15 people can't come wedding. fix it.

I think need course action sustainable long term. includes emphasizing basic behaviors really make difference, face coverings, washing hands, 6 feet, reserving forced closures highest risk settings, bars, sports stadiums, live concerts, maybe limiting indoor dining well banning large gatherings poor citizens (which necessarily stupid, logistically challenged). choose losing day's wages could throw major financial hardships, send kid school sick, guess option pick... Duh! That's normal behavior. one many reasons person class bad idea Agreed. teach analogy... common sense touch shit shake someone's hand 1 even 5 minutes later.

EDIT: misspelled word Idk stealth edited previous comment see 2nd study first saw previous comment.

Yes shows limited view ""lets look excess deaths month period"" terrible view arent looking whole picture. whole picture shows excess deaths government mandated lockdowns response covid cause many deaths continue excess deaths least decade, far outpace covid deaths longrun. overall IFR 0.3% entire world population contracted total deaths would 23 million dead. entire population catch it. UN estimates starvation add additional 136 million deaths due lockdowns. Whoa, let get straight. shield group accounts nearly half covid-19 deaths, deaths will... drop? mean key reducing covid deaths isnt shaming teenagers hanging friends? shocking. Another tragic consequence zero national plan dealing pandemic. Working parents paid hourly can't afford forego work watch kids, send school they'll spread virus among peers. ikr guy harrassing dared ask sources claim coronavirus gives 30% people life long complications. People still still scrubbing surfaces taking temperatures thinking stop spread. OMG Chinese stuff junk? That's shock! recently looked yes. Private sector companies 500 people. caring sick child, get 2/3rds normal pay 12 weeks.  It‚Äôs almost like workplaces punish taking care sick kids, give paid time so, shit show time ;) 03 grad. Never nurse. feel like mandatory point many posts. many comments, obviously sarcastic, get downvoted shadow realm due people I‚Äôm assuming thinking serious What's chemical Los Angeles?

Edit: reading comment chain assume linoleic acid. hear saying... also understand getting paid working benefit base expectation many system currently set (talking mostly US here).

I think suck... expecting employers automatically cover employee's healthcare, paid vacations, sick days, travel moving expenses, portions retirement savings, etc completely fair many cases. likely sign far larger modern-day issues things like:

* corruption healthcare system
* family-work lifestyles changing pretty dramatically last \~50 years
* areas local larger governments probably pitching in... etc.

To suddenly call ""selfish employers"" reason people sending sick kids school bit base. addition above, also take viruses sicknesses seriously even year ago. Let's honest here.

For example, certainly part, fact usually feel personally OK sending sick kid school, could allow system grow two working parents built-in solution handle coming up...

It also worth noting, though completely relevant statement, MANY employers, people families well, getting hurt badly 2020 well. Many temporarily pulling back offered benefits order keep cash hand unexpected future like are, blame all. Can't say much ventilator turns out. good, appreciate people still cautious virus. Stay safe asymptomatic wouldn‚Äôt tagged fever scan. They're already manufacturing vaccine. first announced, also announced would beginning manufacturing well preparation approval road. huge supply ready day one. r/agedlikemilk 1) People report loss smell COVID-19

2) People also report loss smell Parkinsons

3) Therefore, COVID-19 causes Parkinsons, Q.E.D.

Science! think part problem impending emergency approvals. emergency action actually jeopardizes phase 3s, even potentially effective vaccines. 1st vaccinated would highest risk.

What's more, we're actually starting issues hotspots enrollment. country infection rates control, trials slow. Countries high infection rates seeing multiple large scale trials. US alone 4 now- meaning 150000 people trials trying target hotspots US.

Challenge trials make sense 1st generation vaccines, especially likely see least 1 2 bunch succeed form. does, however, make sense 2nd 3rd generation vaccines may super effective large scale trials available, improvements existing vaccines. think coincidence targeting January potential end year emergency approvals. One schools daughter didnt nurse couldnt afford one. Worst school ever attended. intentionally provoke arguments

I could see ending disaster. offering take kids watch them?  No, innovation needs done system, system perfect. 

Your clearly think I'm saying something I'm not, here's tip, believe universal healthcare yelling wind topic. I'm talking one concept comment replied to, anything insurance lol Things get really fucked cold flu season around corner. people supposed manage every one starts getting runny nose? simple answer stay home work/school go get tested. Unfortunately lot people, getting tested would cost hundreds dollars results would take several days week get back. even lucky enough afford cost test, virtually one afford miss week work everytime someone family gets sniffles. defending parents knowlingly send sick kids school all, parent I'm scared coming months bring. family live Rockies. require apology term ‚Äúrocky mountain spotted fever. 

Part ancestry Germanic. require apology term ‚ÄúGerman measles‚Äù. shocking me. Indiana always school nurses. 5 days week. spent lot time body trash. talking masks hate them

This dumb. Masks little let us things care more! ridiculous hill die on. Teacher unions illegal several states. population density don‚Äôt see stop without vaccine. Good luck, India üçÄüôèüçÄ go Fauci!!!!! Tell people town. article posted, residents immediately started attacking poster claiming HIPPA allow name business. want name business towns people basically forcing keep information private. Claiming singled out. insane. 200000 people dead but... him. He's ego. He‚Äôs dumb all. Unfortunately knows exactly he's - he‚Äôs quite prepared allow lots people die order party succeed. Hhm Mexico‚Äôs rate tragic. anything public health like obesity, Mexico‚Äôs country think fatter US video starts beginning exchange. gets worse. Even jobs great benefits tend culture issues. Take sick leave need, better less boss boss‚Äô boss thinks (but doesn‚Äôt communicate) much, otherwise microscope excuse used deny promotions eventually push out. leads cultures ‚Äúpowering through‚Äù valued people show sick infect coworkers customers. I'm sure company willfully shoving asbestos babies' assholes women's vaginas take shortcuts here! someone could seen coming company get 21 days year (sick vacation rolled one) end year cash remaining days out, roll even put company pot help anyone may take unexpected time health reasons may able cover days.

Not sure companies this. Days literally great company keeping workers happy fresh. get push back requesting day long still handle business. world may different though. Whats consensus deep breathing exercises preventative / recovery measures? Wouldnt send viruses deep lunge? Whats rationale? Yea you‚Äôre beyond brian dead instantly see satire. Moron. 1.

Wtf wrong people? No, EUA declared subjects given placebo must told given placebo, option get real vaccine. study over. might add, studies done country may also reduced data placebo groups studies too. can't someone placebo group medicine determined effective enough emergency use. really though? wife mild symptoms none all. Sorry disappoint sub looks like part 95%+ recover easily. says 15. idea talking about. one cares one suffering dying. That's nothing change. Right global fucking pandemic. That's ok little shit stuffy nose life threatening virus. That's cool since lived there. I'm Singapore encountered plenty times people who've never telling things cannot country like chewing gum etc. :)  think wrote paper something? first neutralizing antibody studies come China pandemic showed significant number people never develop neutralizing antibody SARS-CoV-2. absolutely surprising see reinfections. Herman Cain's team tweeting nothing burger account died it.

Learning likely. one sick day ""floating holiday"" PTO another name (that can't cash out) sick leave per year. Anything either use PTO non-paid leave.

Luckily able get paid short term disability surgery earlier year. Glad I'm one! Norway locked March.

No comparison Sweden.  what, specifically? I'll take that, wanna bet? see good news. Catching Coronavirus death sentence, less 1% people get Coronavirus actually die it. Yeah, behavior going unforgivable. people getting permanently cut social list.

The primary concern ""lack empathy"". People display blatant lack empathy people longer willing tolerate. History shown, identify people evil wrong. can't hide lack empathy, see it, different feeling person, like really need relationship someone like that?

People give never committed first place. spreading misinformation confusion cover craven self-serving acts defiance. minority, showing sub droves reason. Except Americans refuse take since longer trust anything publicly stated administration fraudulent posts CDC site.

Those polls showing number Americans trust vaccine Trump touts keep dropping like stone. vast majority Americans responding take vaccine free, statement sorely lacking context. Thank sharing this, great know places New Mexico responsible overall public health. Awesome Hear! occurred dumb fuck thinks actually literally clean coal burning probably think wash black air less sooty/dirty burns. 

Imagine voting run country, thinks knows everything everything yet one ignorant people fucking planet. 

THis parents, happens never tell child no, pay teachers/schools pass never tell he's wrong. create fucking psychopaths understand everything say fucking nonsense. think infection rates similar symptoms death rates lower younger population. talk someone. well want check number really still recruit TODAY. win parents TODAY. something deeply unpopular burn goodwill gained 1975 today. Vets spit back then. really respectable join service. Parents going keep kids military seen domestic oppressor. definitely legal consequences shit. irresponsible dangerous moron. ....Is satire? lmao. Ask Uighers think Chinese provide light dark times. nurse one school Mon Wed Fri, another school Tues Thurs. mean ""New York 22""? Either push towards US made vaccine due big pharma patents etc $$$ fair also happens people take advantage sick leave policies. 

A lot colds hitting Mondays Fridays. discourages companies giving benefits. someone getting masters public health, tell rate stillbirths among Hispanic women lower average, slightly higher whites, probably lower whites adjust SES? Assuming racism still plays role. 

My contention racism isn‚Äôt play medical system regards day day care; rather it‚Äôs systemic access issue needs solved education campaigns increase awareness access have. Yes. SARS. always good memory games kid; hope immune system taking notes!! Rand Paul created accreditation organization eye doctors even let self- certification lapse. None Fun Begun think it‚Äôd fine tourist pay it. You‚Äôre paying premium vacation pandemic.

Except tourists need vacation less Hawaii needs money. People live without vacation, Hawaii can‚Äôt really without third economy ‚Äúpay less state don‚Äôt go bankrupt‚Äù hard sell. mean, they‚Äôre fucked. There‚Äôs way really. that‚Äôs risk run putting eggs LA county get tested many times want free even you‚Äôre asymptomatic. wonder California affording that. friends get tested week

California ‚Äúaffording‚Äù way they‚Äôre ‚Äúaffording‚Äù rest lavish welfare state. They‚Äôre going deeper debt hoping one day they‚Äôll manage extract taxes Silicon Valley giants execs pay back. surely blow face. Connecticut played exact game hedge funds, assure doesn‚Äôt work out. There‚Äôs always cheaper state move to, especially current remote work environment. Looking back pandemic, many people send sick kids, even masks?? Exactly, workplace also rolls vacation sick days together everyone comes work sick want save vacation days for, duh, vacation!

There **is** easy solution everyone loves ignore - unlimited sick time. Everyone claims abused, studies shown 6% workers abuse time, work around anyways requiring doctors note 2-3 days row time off. Bullshit. domestic oil production dwarfs Venezuela's. Also oil extremely low quality. Economic mismanagement destroyed Venezuela. put price controls food made farmers would lose money every crop. course farmers stopped growing food, what's point? us choice stay home would. People would complaining stuff stock stores orders late. People complain don‚Äôt realize stuff don‚Äôt magically appear shelves warehouses. People seem take things granted easily accessible stuff America. Ok. That‚Äôs fair. goes ways. friend's OB would prenatal checks telling overweight, diabetic, high blood pressure might needs come every 2 weeks monitored they'd never see again. is, 6 weeks later she'd come back emergency. can't make people go doctor. ended leaving field handle lack concern parents. course side effect racial, socioeconomic mess US. High obesity, poor education. literally billboards poor neighborhoods saying sex without protection want baby. winning yet? Yay, scientists! worst spread seeing 200-300 new cases day, 50-150. hear hospitals pretty underwhelmed, dont lot cases needing treated great.

at start pandemic pretty much everything closed except grocery stores banks, could go banks appointment. restaurants option drive thru carry forced close minute. labor unions pressured governor reopening in-door dining may threatening lawsuit. cases started spiking closed again, think in-door dining still limits im sure. mass drive thru testing started early stages test kits accessible here. businesses individuals subject fine anyones wearing mask. universities in-person classes we've done well observing covid precautions didnt see another spike semester started. also think dry climate helps

generally, public consensus regarding covid precautions pretty good. we've bitchy karens, covid deniers, dumb kids throwing parties, like places, seem make much smaller portion population states X x xx x v  CBC v v CBC x xv v x xx x v  Xx x v v ca v v vv xx v xx v XX xx v v  C XX v x c v v v XX v x XX c c v v v v nxv x XX c v c v v XX v CD x c v c c v v v v mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmv v obviously never read book watched show. would know it‚Äôs part plot, assumption made single character show climate change denier.

Ah yes, someone posts in‚ÄùCoronavirus Circlejerk‚Äù sure understand parallel current political environment dystopian novel similar parallels. groups aren‚Äôt wealthy all. lower middles class, anything. NYC standards would actually call kinda poor. I've never heard *not* speak like that. Germans get four weeks vacation too. Every job.  There's zero chance Cuomo let Met die, especially since NYC already slowly reopening. They'll figure way. Whether partial capacity, etc. kid's daycare, one girls discovered lice. dad came pick up, front me, started arguing daycare director allowed pick end day. Fucking incredible thoughtless selfish people are. still don‚Äôt understand saying let try one time. Yes risk school school important fucking candy. college goes much candy bring home 2020. Yeah sure exposure would minimal would still risk fucking candy. Trust kid told could get bunch candy didn‚Äôt knock bunch strangers houses get would take it. mom teacher symptoms still decided go work bothered write sub plan. were. made sense me, either. different types midwives, states ban lay midwives, Alabama one last states allow Certified Nurse Midwives ‚Äî almost many years school training doctor ‚Äî practice legally. OBs far away hospitals option then. 

I hoped birthing centers would pop rural areas legalized hasn‚Äôt happened yet. also record cause death mothers die following childbirth, implemented measures use higher ranking countries already tried tested methods improving outcomes. Next time stop Enid Onion Burger. Idk Oklahoma proud them.

It even harder people always experts tell do.  Says person spends Reddit time r/collapse lmfao. Absolutely. there's one thing pandemic exposed, Americans whole breathtakingly selfish. personally would gladly pay higher taxes, even help personally, meant people would able good healthcare quality childcare good education. I'm minority. see many people arguing good healthcare (though someone America calls good healthcare, would beg differ - took 3 years pay cancer treatment), paid college, need daycare, care anyone else? mind blowing . *context*. wanted say perspective, but, even so, seasonal flu less dangerous COVID-19. useful relevant practical comparison, revealing hidden aspects it, opposite, muddying waters.  be. That‚Äôs said test multiple times. yes, need better test. I‚Äôm sure tough scientists trying design test new virus middle pandemic time crunches, sure would great get accurate tests true. Parents *pissed* kids can‚Äôt play sports. 

A color code map (by county) determines whether kids go school not, aren‚Äôt person due percent infected county week, class sports teams cannot compete. state surging now, cases leaders (and parents want kids school regardless cases) pushing everyone symptomatic tested percent infection gets lower (more negative tests, essentially). 

More testing always good, right it‚Äôs driven desire little Johnny play football. 

I wouldn‚Äôt say WV heavily infected (below 3% rate currently) certainly trending poorly worst Rt nation weeks - came bit recently. 

Anyway, kind rant. really disappointed deliberate concealing data especially area important schools. Fucking deductibles. got bill nearly $250 ultrasound bloodwork need done twice year, every year rest life follow surviving cancer 4 years ago, make sure cancer doesn‚Äôt return. That‚Äôs insurance HRA kick in. don‚Äôt consider required bloodwork ultrasound ‚Äúroutine, preventative care‚Äù counts toward insanely high deductible never ever meet calendar resets. means get pay $500 year penalty surviving cancer bare minimum. best health insurance state. 

My solace live one states would guarantee coverage even ACA goes away. lived anywhere else could uninsurable forever. You‚Äôre reading way much this. system untenable. People can‚Äôt afford healthcare. isn‚Äôt. About. You. Personally. stop. even know parts ""real"" vs satire well written error blows mind. someone thinking need vaccine Spanish Flu healthy go fight Fritz. Covid expected around forever, kind metrics (testing/hospitalizations/deaths) need reach go back ""normal""? lot stems systemic racism medical field, well systemic misogyny.

The statistics bear out. 

Pre-term births (which account stillbirths) occur high rates amongst black indigenous women due poor pre-natal care, high rate smoking, drug alcohol use high maternal mortality rate amongst black women suffer hypertension mothers backgrounds, leading causes death include cardiovascular conditions, hemorrhage, infection. However, non-Hispanic Black women, leading causes death include cardiovascular conditions addition cardiomyopathy, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia (hypertensive disorders).

This due obesity, diabetes, possibly genetic sensitivity I‚Äôm sorry loss. condition called vasa previa years go. undetected prior labor, causes stillbirth. told US starting train ultrasound techs spot it, may something always properly diagnosed 10 years ago. nothing mother ‚Äúwrong‚Äù cause it, happens randomly. myth women unhealthy unhealthy pregnancies... young healthy women bad pregnancies, too. didn‚Äôt anything wrong. fact people thinking going trick treating confuses me.


I love Halloween usually go decorations. know people taking kids trick treating town whether choose participate. Thinking wearing mask, sitting porch bucket candy 6ft away telling kid handful. also handle candy bare hands. 

I've seen others come creative ideas. One guy took long hollow tube attached porch railing kids could hold buckets underneath dropped candy through. mean lot things done make safer, also many anti maskers conspiracy theorists kids, probably would hesitant let go door door. surprised all. Parents always sending sick kids school. act different now? can't really tell actually people believe ACTUALLY substitution normal face mask. really screams 'murica work NICU Queens NYC. Huge tick premature babies unit. Also seems stillbirths premature babies making unit don‚Äôt make Labor Delivery rooms Yes every American read passed... wish US government would offer free flu vaccines American requests one, well free COVID-19 vaccines available. probably save government money long run. town rude wake call. 

People believe real, parents talking Covid parties kids catch it. Throwing fits wear masks grocery store, promoting fact require get business. 

They found coivd elementary school, kid ties day care. Guess what? They're still open. 

They canceled Oktoberfest doctor town understands, put request it. People still going show up, almost guarantee it. 

A lady local bank continued go work showing symptoms FUCKING WEEK. 2 kids tested positive. understand HIPPA laws, come fuck on. even tell us bank. many people selfishly put risk? 

I hate idiots country. hate anti maskers think wearing cloth piece face oppression. I'm sick everyone here. 

The local hospital even fit treat patients is. People air lifted Denver regularly hospital proper equipment. anyone thinking screwed thanksgiving? colleges incubate disease 3 months send kids home 60 year old parents grandparents planes busiest travel day year restrictions that, like company size, made inapplicable ton people?

It also well publicized, considering important is. think mainly heroin meth. told height opioid crisis could heroin popular Yea one wants precious braydens scared. Youd think people would want go cheap childrens spooky movie night theater, fun halloween festivals (like school raffle simple carnival games one year fun), scary haunted houses hayrides, petting zoos pumpkin patches, halloween dance, actually *do* shit around Halloween, no, visiting strangers get free candy, either walking ages getting car one seeing awesome costume. Outside candy, kid even enjoys that? 

I loved carving pumpkins, loved decorating lawn filling pumpkin trash bags leaves, loved getting dressed up, loved watching movies, going spooky related events. adult friend brought historical site talked specific families traditions around death mourning. respectful, sooooo eerie isolated. Really enjoyable, loved updated tours seasonal related modern experiences. Another time want watch party friends college campus Rocky Horror. Neither something kids specifically, great ideas adapted kids halloween. (The tour could like schools teach Thanksgiving). 2 staff members 2 different schools 12 days since reopening county 20,000 tested positive. response? They're gonna send k-4 school 4 days week instead 2.

No, making up. hell. hospital around? abortion clinic? happened friend also state one abortion clinic able go there. Woah saw curve happened? 

We stressing west slow increase cases 6 months guys managed beat us weeks. made lab.... Even fucked up, requires understanding math.

The amount US spends Medicare/Medicaid VA, divided population US, Canada pays health care everyone, divided population Canada(see note below). 

The US government already spends enough health care universal coverage, spend inefficiently. 

Another way put folks worried higher taxes losing benefits ""every dollar individuals businesses spend health care health insurance goes inefficientcy insurance company profits, current government spending would cover everyone current system.""

Hitting people ""every dollar pay co-pays denied charges system inefficient, pay taxes pay taxes insurance companies,"" quite satisfying. also make sure call insurance costs ""taxes paid corporations instead government."" known long time virus airborne like flu colds, looks like CDC let cat bag. encourage read sub rules lobbing insults.

I highly doubt done anything. Ever. left nation fear life continuously advocated change. Immune responses, like *any* biological response, happen spectrum intensity. Every single virus cause reinfections small proportion individuals. Let put way: vaccinated previously infected individuals come fucking symptomatic *measles* reinfections every year, virus known inducing ridiculously strong lifelong immunity. (And complain immune amnesia measles, misunderstanding topic, also completely missing point.)

What's likely just, biologically idiosyncratic reason, generate great immune response. happens sometimes, unfortunately. It‚Äôs terrifying think many metric based insights lost general feelings year.

How think exactly tell someone‚Äôs BP elevated months find lump anything else. agree. opinion adults free decide risks take, long reasonable opportunity informed. see problem this, provided participants informed risks, including possibility receive placebo protection, initial viral load associated risks, risk COVID-19 specific medical conditions, risk enhancement effect possible vaccines.

So yeah. I'm asshole sent kid school COVID. symptoms, sure would get negative result 17 yo.  

In retrospect, made wrong call, hard kid *isn't* sick, they've already missed 6 months school, head, always thinking: ""Ok, false alarm miss school and/or work, that's going even harder us false alarm."" really needs safeguards place.  ""Oh, yeah, still airborne; mean post airborne."" county* Wisconsin even make full month. kid went person school starting 9/3 week kids virtual. said may open 2 weeks depending current contracted case ratio guarantee close another weeks.

Even Nana.
-Thomas Jefferson hoax guess added /s thought obvious literally called moron comments ago. Yeah fair enough, fuck EA though CDC tell people wear 'face coverings' get masks? Surely masks effective? Somebody correct I'm getting wrong, article seems say reinfections vaccine totally different reinfections virus, vaccine scientists know this, really reason assume reinfections vaccine going problem. also pay far fewer taxes.

You pay significantly less overall (because many rich people pay basically nothing) tax difference middle class family income tax difference perhaps 10%.

It‚Äôs definitely significant, people often makes sound like Scandinavians pay 70% Americans pay next nothing. 

When reality, Americans ‚Äúonly‚Äù taxed 6-7% less OECD average. listening director CDC said,‚Äù Fauci told Paul. ‚ÄúIf believe 22% herd immunity, believe you‚Äôre alone that.‚Äù Go walk. Get fresh air. Stand balcony outside apartment. anything else spam us reinfection articles aren‚Äôt reliable sources. gigantic protest...

Ya say bc positivity rate decreasing believe (might double check) yeah virus really isn‚Äôt comes apocalypse capabilities lol... want run numbers think deaths 10% USA it? idk please go outside

Shit's complicated deal best case scenario usage spread never assumed. Well, mean, let's fair. Social safety nets taking features socialism. Socialism disgusting word applied insult willynilly. That's stupid American ignorance. government ever pure &lt;insert pure types perfect theory practice. Serious question, pill Vitamen take loads system Vitamen help reduce risk ? think you‚Äôre infected ?

or maybe gallons Milk ? :) That‚Äôs true. There‚Äôs federal law requiring public school nurses. child ill get 80 % pay stay home 60-120 days/year.

Is real? easy/difficult claim? Anything amazing makes think must make hard actually claim. Coal too! go far, fact new cases rising testing. thing is, new cases rising, hospitalizations continue decline says lot super deadly world ending virus.  Idk man, shitty business practices guess. makes irrationally annoyed behalf. Probably something deal with, damn thats dumb. Right-o, mate. I‚Äôm sure completely aware risks something that‚Äôs never tested. constantly finding new areas long term affects virus people didn‚Äôt virus injected directly body. Scientists.... needs em.... Murica looking 80 page pdf sure itÔºåI'm sure even exist, honestly believe author article would read anyway. 

The point author cited ECRI report/study support article. clear report/study actually back said. Thus, there's good reason suspect whether author trying mislead audience.

Edit: 
Went ECRI website article says exact thing. probably incorrect saying author usatoday trying mislead. Still, curious actual report linked earlier kinda vague supporting narrative. Right here. Work military training missions full schedule. We've several positive cases, week split schedule we're back ignoring fact exists. Feels like I'm one three guys still wearing mask workplace. boss said would go away summer heat, said another flu stuck around.

It's sad knowing accept it. made comment suggesting facts COVID-era prenatal care outcomes false based personal experience reckless state low population (but shockingly high infection rate # people), suggesting pushback baseless claim unfair somehow people want get care? That's deflection, ma'm. Pregnant people going less appointments stillbirths up. experience getting care could want (which suggests level privelege) bearing facts. Saved far though. deaths still ultimately result virus.

Turns country full selfish assholes refuse take virus seriously nasty side effect prolonging pandemic curbing effectiveness attempts save people. ""These redditors"" never socialized, lets real. don‚Äôt think clear. don‚Äôt actually pay people make guns, employ people companies either wages contracts employ every day people like either make things develop things would useful military society, things like pharmaceuticals, technology (like internet), chemicals, solvents, pesticides, construction materials, medical devices, etc. Denmark workplaces 2-3 days payed sick leave children days reset every sickness / child, child 1 gets sick get stay home, child 2 gets sick half week later, get stay home.

I'm going talk like here, there's enough salt wounds.

Best luck you! Reddit told Sweden careful that's situation bad right now. picture people standing six inches apart without masks definitely Sweden. Shocking!

I surprised behavior 

This completely character Americans Fuck em. can't get money adds spam with, figure better business model. company causing cancer talcom/baby powder. Wonder 1 800 bad drug commercial look like this..... Yes, sort of. social distancing always possible, possible rely social distancing.

And extent virus airborne, masks may help reduce airborne transmission.  

Social distancing combined masks make sense. Masks supplement to, substitute for, social distancing. president's comment -- mine üôÑ way could well lock weeks giving government valuable time get test trace

You mean like time locked 3 weeks give hospitals time overwhelmed. oh wait

'2 weeks slow spread' right literally impossible. true, least universally. Lots people give generous crisis pregnancy centers charities offer great deal support women need. good number pro-life voters would certainly support broad government action ensure everyone access healthcare basic necessities -- political home two parties. Remember, \~40% Americans Independents. Comparing poverty US average QOL developing countries ridiculous. seriously need learn life like many areas developing countries embarass comparing top 10% world wealth american poor have. Fellow Americans upset lockdowns country, wouldn‚Äôt position hadn‚Äôt fucked badly. Sit &amp; accept consequences. Biden going win? say thing Hillary? Even good insurance Americans financially screwed major illness serious injury. sustainable. That‚Äôs really good news hope get wedding dream of. it‚Äôs already happening suck. guess wouldn‚Äôt change effectiveness mask. I‚Äôm sick wear mask, protecting mask would prevent respiratory droplets exiting mouth nose becoming airborne. They're full shit vaccines give still first used end pandemic home.

Plenty offering, China Russia going end pandemic home long anywhere say Africa starts get vaccines amount emergency workers literally paying get middle class born it.  particular coronavirus new (hence term novel) know would virus's behave differently. recommendations changing. That's already happening. baby 2019 years doubt indecision. longer explain sliver optimism allowed it, least poverty yet. friends fence leaning towards, ""we can't afford it, much debt already, world burning."" Universal paid family leave solution. It‚Äôs time. crisis showing us necessary benefit slowing transmission virus. Cover expenses? get fired taking time work? take candy, give piece time wiping like Kim said actually extreme OCD affects every single day.

There's nothing inherently unsafe raw milk makes impossible consume safely

This simply untrue tuberculosis (as well e coli) raw milk consistent problem long factory farming thing. Cows sleep filth time. udders occasionally covered shit. fussed that, be. factory farming. 

In general, know US requirements quite well EU requirements less well, spent time Europe requirements same, enforcement **drastically** less. I've definitely seen things simply permitted United States restaurant wholesale level. There's lot of, presumably, grandfathered architecture operating restaurants insufficient access plumbing stuff do. 


Also, last checked, EU still require food handlers ""minimize"" barehand contact (I assume guys still Norovirus, right?)

I'm saying US better EU, different. different enforcement priorities really fair compare directly. kids going back time soon. Well, fact two chronic respiratory problems. theory

I think believe theory somehow derogatory. I'm speaking scientific sense alternative would scientific law somev kind. Remember said I'm sure theory proven? Yeah, I'm debating findings. I'm pointing flip side. yes, theories. thing think really allowing us I'm arguing one right one wrong anything, sharing personal observation systemic thinking all. guy advise Ireland

Not 11 secondary 11, tertiary 18.

Not Sweden. parents send sick kids school another kid catches dies. Easy, charge original parents homicide. So...are wear mask mask, reverse.

Points first person answer ""yes"" tweet whining this? us 10 years older worse old enough *see* realistic push Universal Healthcare labor reform.... toilet flushed went it. as? conservative county state. mask mandate governor county board declared us ‚Äúsanctuary county‚Äù says doesn‚Äôt apply us. sheriff outright denounced won‚Äôt enforce it. 

People think it‚Äôs joke, goes FAR beyond lack child care on. issue some, yea, definitely. people capable managing way another. 

The political rhetoric public health crisis increasingly strong primary driving force behind happening here. burden rate sky high. Make sure get oximeter measure oxygen. shit exactly pulled kids preschool. People inconsiderate wear masks. sure hell care sending sick kids school. many, many places US Catholic hospitals literally choice. big problem growing smaller hospitals clinics die profit system. terrifying stats this. comparison New York Sweden crap. Sweden population density 64/mi\^2 New York State 421/mi\^2. Rand Paul obviously comparing New York City Sweden want get even accurate Stockholm (27,000/mi\^2 vs 13,000/mi\^2). 

The closer comparisons would New Mexico Pennsylvania far case rates fatality rates go... still creating queue line front house every house, crowd, good spread. would say starts fact spread surfaces.

Is fact? cases covid found frozen food packaging reported. I've read too, convinced. 
Onus guy advise Ireland.
Primary 11 secondary 11, tertiary 18. spain‚Äôs cases drop half like week, shoot back yesterday? testing halted/slowed down? Republicans: ""Brown people using it"" know sure? well stated - we've sadly moved, long time ago, 'how I/we make money X' instead 'what best' 'how help people' checked it? read FFCRA can‚Äôt find reason employer wouldn‚Äôt bound it, I‚Äôd definitely start asking questions. true. Since beginning pandemic, Koreans religiously wore K94 surgical. Note shortage either mask like US. fact, SK gov. rationed everyone wear fresh one daily. -you're supposed use 20hr so. sure hour mask work anymore keep wearing one. search Korean news clips, see 98% people wearing surgical k94 although hot, humid summer(it's identical US South) wore dental mask. concept ""face covering"" exist think wearing bandana clothes made mask wearing, hence threatening public health somewhat true. don't. groovy. 

what's point, though? Yikes. filling paperwork whatever hassle, I'm gonna send kid school let problem. way secretary gets paid enough deal bullshit. That‚Äôs crazy. education system keeps surpassing expectations shitty possibly be. Yikes. Imagine speculated like diseases test all. Maybe tuberculosis know it. Yeah man. godawful drivers. them. learn shit literally child. guess never progressed past stage. trust vaccine Europeans Chinese approve. explained over, think willfully ignoring point, I'll try one time:

reinfection proven person two illnesses, separated time, genetically sequenced, even counts two different strains. 

So no, millions people done. 

But again, keeps explained think trolling trying deceive people reason. Great response. Keep eating fear porn journalists spoon feeding thing going Europe also. Deaths lag cases shit. Parents don‚Äôt sick days you. one surprised public healthcare universal paid leave sick days / kids sick days.

Where‚Äôs model says 50k cases/day possible? US peaked 78k we‚Äôre 5x size UK, never 6k. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. place I‚Äôve never seen Costco.

Probably membership requirement. Citation: [http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JPD-202211](http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JPD-202211) Every day learn something new country makes even depressed. 

I run statewide programs help disabled population, working national partners make changes way world sees disability aging. matter many people programs help, many policies legislation changed efforts, tiny drops colander country, actions drive improvement equity slip divisive destructive efforts remain. 

I‚Äôm tired. parents kept kids home, too, kid would runny nose less often. It‚Äôs great point little kids don‚Äôt hold large, maskless gatherings outside school unless parents still throwing birthday parties.

But think significant factor young kids don‚Äôt spread virus easily, idea never really disproven. we‚Äôve shown young kids high viral load, necessarily translates transmission.

Take study South Korea showed index cases 10 half likely spread people household age groups. Also we‚Äôve studies show young kid spread someone household it‚Äôs often parent someone else responsible taking care them, meaning situation prolonged contact. see masks distancing precautions place elementary schools combined naturally less tendency little ones spread virus expect R&lt;1, would lead occasional cases schools, large outbreaks. mean parents always sent sick kids school. Sometimes think allergies turns flu corona. sometimes work send kids anyway. sometimes worried getting trouble strict attendance policies truancy court CPS. sometimes kids worry grades suffer show maybe would miss important presentation test etc. 

The way combat get rid attendance policies period make negative consequences absent. Yes, mask mandate effect Wisconsin currently. extended yesterday November 21. extention, set expire next week.

There current push courts declare mandate unconstitutional like Safer Home order May. H1N1 spread California. somehow, nobody going around calling ""American virus"". wonder why? many kids could left home alone though? kid responsible enough lay couch feeling shitty watching TV playing tablet something? not, say parenting? agree probably millions cases back March-April millions never got tested confirmed infection. know, thousands re-infected today thinking got first time. 

11 confirmed re-infections super low I'm concerned yet. think overall logic bit flawed. It‚Äôs ironic many Redditors support draconian measure necessary ‚Äúprotect grandma‚Äù likely socializing last flu season, flu seasons prior that, unknowingly spreading flu killing grandmas. didn‚Äôt seem give shit then, sudden self righteous saviors. Ah. is. Missed satire Oracle, obviously. It‚Äôs parents blame. years schools given awards perfect attendance. Even sick days workplace culture America absolutely toxic towards usage even necessary. year people truly seeing messed priorities American society culture. thought face shield supported eye covering. not? Maybe contact &amp; tracing Taiwan shovel ""mysterious cause"" category Fauci ""Science care opinion"" embodied. Oh boy, wish they'd tell us company improves reputation name larger set people! that‚Äôs would never comfortable sending kids school. Every year kids sent school sick.  People disgusting sick leave know with, Reddit makes keep kid home runny nose, I'd eventually run out. pointing out, lot people could afford kids born, something changed since then. Also, maybe proper sex Ed, proper access birth control abortions, people didn‚Äôt get shat announce want child-free, might less issues children born bad situations. exactly. Kids look forward stuff like this. Especially may much else going them. Yeah would punish sexually active women whores?

#/S Reddit: positive racism = racist

Also reddit: negative racism = go ahead, nice day sir even qualify FMLA, ton paperwork get paid. supposed lose job missing time caring family member. find legitimate reason fire you... Paywall girlfriend second-grade teacher bracing inevitable. People suck much. :/ shocked pikachu face getting pretty worn know kids school DAY LONG mask 7 hours day got sick yet. see Halloween dangerous. People answer doors put light like every damn year want trick treaters. complicated still can't believe first world country people can't take sick days pay. literally live shit hole country take 20 study days pay, limit sick days can't fired without reasonable cause. right. Ppl put chirurgical/clothe mask top tho.


I want precise ""well"". best thing get protect yourself: P100 filter virtually perfect seal. really supply shortage, US government trying hid severity pandemic? Well that‚Äôs you‚Äôre blatantly wrong. Masks distancing aren‚Äôt enough prevent spread 100 kids virus continue going grocery shopping class wherever. seem think masks 6 feet apart enough that‚Äôs proven nearly effective staying home, meeting large groups, etc.

And herd immunity bullshit too. Lmao I‚Äôm laughing you. story parents sent son first day high school. getting positive coronavirus test. Presumably boy passed temperature screening got school. send kid school known positive test, I'm keeping kid home sniffles fever.

Every single year went school, elementary high school, everybody develops sniffles fall. writing assignments, room cacophony sniffling along usual rumbling stomachs people holding morning farts.

Colds allergies still exist, reason stay home work school. figure US learn Every single time see r/idiotsincars material highway always Illinois license plate. Always. Schools started.. closed since March. United States CDC best infectious disease experts America. scientists concluded premature conclude coronavirus airborne. instead trusting experts, people spreading fake news covid instead? went school MD, graduated 2013 always nurse 4 schools attended. Since worked 4 schools county also nurses. *shocked pikachu face* Yeah no. ‚úåüèΩ secretaries that. 2006 grad school nurse. handbook said supposed around Monday‚Äôs never saw heard one existing. office admins would give ice pack bandage call parents, EMS needed. us carried painkillers asked around needed something. Try asking Germans Here's [the research think behind interview and/or comments btw.

It puts perspective critique focus solely (in opinions slightly) different policy. Reality might complex. context got left Western media: attacking Xi long time.

This state media attacking back 2016: http://www.xinhuanet.com//politics/2016-02/29/c_128763189.htm personally send kids school fever free 24 hours med free. Use called common sense!! Fauci tearing morning amazing.

I can't believe people think unlicensed/fake license eye doctor knowledgable infectious disease qualified living expert topic. Cant gym filled symptoms kids? Schools need understand accept parents (and ppl general) responsible. expect everyone follow rules properly. Shut schools don‚Äôt want downplay importance amount education medical providers have, shot doesn‚Äôt need injected vein seems like something almost anyone could decent instructions. Lol see dweebs time wearing 2 masks + shield. scavenger hunt two families hanging throughout quarantine. fun! 2020 Flu deaths compare 2019?

Are people would died flu dying Covid instead? 

Or flu deaths holding steady Covid provides additional deaths? Canadian. live Toronto. fine. numbers going alarming rate. cases doubling every 7 days. think fine. odd all. reason senate pushing laws prevent infected workers suing employers. country run kleptocracy. honestly insane. wife first weeks ago, paid $7 per day parking (in Canada). think 40% figure regarding - 40% people live with/take care someone underlying illness. means can‚Äôt lock vulnerable let healthy people get corona, end infecting vulnerable. regardless try downplay deaths all, simply correcting wrote underlying conditions. believe people would lived years decades without COVID, attribute everything COVID. Even though might small percentage would‚Äôve died anyways, we‚Äôre still undercounting Covid deaths look excess mortality. Ohio I‚Äôd say half people wear mast nose another 5-10% flat refuse wear mask totally handing candy mine. (Wearing regular face mask safety)

I'll answer door underpants yellow rubber gloves. Like every year. New Jersey vital part organism America. Like armpit. Millions cases, 11 reinventions. I‚Äôm scared! Here's site tracking US school want even easier find recent build guide YouTube that‚Äôs price range build exact one minor variations. Helps follow guide exactly tee Yeah, read Mexico vastly underreported. Saw interview guy owns morgue Mexico said huge increase death especially caused pneumonia like 3 weeks Mexico even first official covid death. what's risk level permitted usually? 1% may result adverse effects? .1%? would think possible, orifices, least concerning. also debilitating protect. eye wear mask, still see, breathe, speak. Covering ears makes difficult hear dangerous. North Texas got like 2 days light rain last week that's lmao Face it, way many stupid, ignorant dumb ass citizens country. Neat. link anything that, someone else ready volunteer?

I'm tired completely useless mind signing up. absolutely care.

Socialized medicine greatly depends details. I'm Canadian system UK system.

As individual get assigned doctor like get assigned school teacher. right choose someone comfortable with.

Research also shows people comfortable doctors share useful information resulting better outcomes. one reasons there's push diversity among doctors. London surveilled city planet. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll problem catching them. two Scandinavias: Sweden, leader COVID-19 fatalities, nations locked hard well.

Lockdowns work begun early enough social distancing works virus can't spread infected people kept away others.  argument favor hard early lockdowns, argument masking. Hey hey speak yourself. Canadians fine. neighbours much. article written 12 year old JFC think point people avoid going doctor can't afford pay bill. ultimately leads major medical issues could avoided major medical issues much expensive regular doctor visits would been. drop premature births directly correlated. stillbirths = less preemies. Babies otherwise would induced early lost due lack medical care. Heartbreaking. priced garbage... cable since 2010.... fuck televised programming. experts saying this, need listen them. It‚Äôs commonly said sub odd United States softening coronavirus safety protocols meat processing facilities, countries seem exact opposite. 

The Germans announced stricter measures couple months back. Chinese. Year, sunny climate developed affordable healthcare wonders. Yeah, I'm sure they'd worried cruise missiles F35s would nuke us soon attacked, would nuke back, Russia North Korea nuke us since understandably appreciate fallout backyards. thought ten square miles surrounded nothing  mean politics like pre-K level thought.

Know audience. ""More more""? No, people acted like bums beginning still acting like bums looking justification getting crowd side. matter many people agree you, spreading disease still wrong. wrong agree. company feel takes compassion. 13 years starting 21. still believe though even compassion given times road map setting things could ousted heart beat. may paranoia, started 20 employees 100 I'm like ""wtf new department..... "". literally job different way.

Like one hand can't really blame owners trying maximize profits make things better. Especially small businesses. bigger get though start adapting corporate ways makes anyone dispensable robotic ways get thing's done anyone them. started human interaction customer. Plenty money made. Wholesome also. departments customer things customers like wtf one address whatever random issues came involvement in.

I literally customers tell liked better work communication, new ""teams"" whose job bounce account account project leaving cleanup.

I like personal touch seems like going window. Like mentioned sorta, companies develop ways discard conform.

I college degree, 13 years taught myself. Help manage huge bank infrastructures. lack degree scares though. Maybe vaccines work many 500 young volunteers infected Covid without protection! there's 4.4% risk one volunteers dying! Worse still: there's 0.2% risk *two* volunteers dying!

Even risks vastly overstated since used [IFR 20-49 age group volunteers near bottom age range (and without preexisting conditions).

The risks HCTs even register pandemic that's killing hundreds thousands wrecking global economy. participants understand this--that's they're volunteering. shit outta luck sent home guess Glad coming light hope parents put blast. Parents REGULARLY send kids flu strep throat contagious illnesses. Teachers babysitters, school daycare. signed parent, stay home child they‚Äôre sick. Please fix ""they're"" edit ""their"" - say anything lil secret ü§´ seven day average daily cases may increasing, seven day average % tests positive continues dropping currently around 4.8% compared almost 9% two months ago. Since way catching 100% cases, case count alone useless determine trends without context number tests required find cases. basic easy understand amazes 6 months people still get it. exactly affect timeline current frontrunners? many Pfizer candidates haven‚Äôt even received second shot yet? people notice side effects, others may generally mild side effects. got flu shot mostly insomnia issues days, may coincidence. gonna fund new entertainment companies? concerts/social events function economy that's floundering? 

Are like 13? Surely concept businesses failing economic downturn new you? fail, grow, new ones form. seriously think entire global word ""tweaks"" hell lot lifting you.

The main difference social distancing, lockdowns mask usage. Lockdowns social distancing disappear. tweaks seems appropriate describe things. wonder polls look like time. Wow, that's awesome. would bet people system probably high levels income end paying taxes would privatized services...so makes sense. vast majority people (in lower middle classes) type social welfare pretty sweet deal. hell thinking.

That disposable money important life. Sorry gut punch sadly truth. I'm sure come conclusion though. would wear though cases low? live Sweden I've stocked face-masks past months precautionary measure case get second wave fall/winter become recommended wearing. I've yet wear since right there's really point. common type face-mask bought (surgical masks) shown especially good preventing spread unless sick person wearing one, meaning need near full coverage population real impact. ongoing studies though might shed new light, that's I'm seeing currently.

Anywhere near full coverage happening actually becomes recommended nationally companies (public transportation stores) actually commit enforce it. happens lone person wearing mask really wearing mental well-being anything (and that's waste money/masks mind). good stock (if pandemic generally), good buying spread everyone buy once! I've gotten bunch surgical ones, rewashable ones (where insert filters), 2 FPP2 masks (for emergencies, want buy many since healthcare needs them, actually expect come contact covid-19-positive people, like hospital, future protect dangerous toxins air something).

I'm glad see Swedes taking preparedness seriously general, comes medical supplies. Swedish government always insisted everyone needs certain level preparedness home (2+ weeks food supply times, etc), COVID-19 March/April wake-up call many people... That's shame. Music important part culture. musician national crisis hard career path. sure downvotes government failed every aspect response. loved fact Fauci finally stood corrected Paul. Gross get kids runny nose check. Sweden perfect covidcurbing think basic universal sick pay necessary. hmm, ok. friend said got sick booster vaccine(?), able explain this? Yeah think school = daycare. missing point. someone ""confirmed re-infection"" confirmed first infection. missed countless infections first wave completely inadequate testing. Millions people virus never got positive test. can't know number true re-infections missed confirming countless early infections, probably majority them. That‚Äôs right. It‚Äôs half assed lockdown best Meanwhile hospitals continue lay nurses... Thank clarification Kaiser permanente maybe differently offices. I'm surprised.

Democrats want make employment miserable possible people get tempted get plantation. people put foot ass made actually something positive people. RT pandemic: ""Is 5G health hazard? Here's bunch specialists saying is""

RT pandemic: ""Why everyone think 5G health hazard? Here's list conspiracy theories""

It's propaganda targeted us sow doubt. goes along stuff like chemtrails injecting microchips, concepts around forever. help call technological exploits ""viruses"" share similar concepts transmission. think conspiracy theories get passed huge problems education, like people latch onto America typically rural areas poorer education, thus never learned critical thinking. it‚Äôs not

Yes, flu deadly, kills tens thousands people year, *even vaccine*. don‚Äôt acknowledge this? Time make criminal charge, letters stating parents knowingly test positive covid tell schools send kids school. nerve selfish people. think would happen, fucking moronic health officers?

You plans families kids, try save 2 weeks getting late everyone else? saw happening That's happens open schools goddamn pandemic. get problem is, they're clearly gearing go toe toe coronavirus. guys trying say, can't kill corona gun, tactical drone strike? said anything lockdowns? dislike one specific NPI grant license encourage reckless spread disease ignore mitigations.  logic makes sense. one think golden parachutes!? Rand Paul father monumental dipshits appeal monuments dipshits. 

I mean politics like pre-K level thought. Interesting wonder things like percentage high risk people living largel care homes, hospices, mixed accomodation likely regular contact doctors nurses may vectors (as well environment worked in) skew numbers. Plus utter lack PPE carers, many work multiple back breaking jobs working one individual working multiple homes hospices potential infect many clients line work. vaccine gets pandemic level disease poses greater risk public health than, say, flu, either reducing possible transmissions lessening serverity symptoms, way operas concerts operate much differently used to. Getting Covid cases 0 never end goal. looking last night. median age Kenya *20*. 45 Spain. infuriating, it? covered super-spreader event, allowed facilitated multiple super-spreader events. scientific malpractice. cost thousands lives. CDC us. 

It feels like betrayal, like getting stabbed back family member. betrayal unimaginably evil, see coming shocked realize you, accident, plot. enough hospitals, doctors medicines; public hospitals well equipped; little access health care outside cities begin far away simple population increase explain. eat bats not. Many immigrants Russia government assistance high those. good friend (Pre Covid) lives Russia.
At beginning emailed ""stay safe, love you"" response kick face. owned business together let buy I'll never speak again. course is. sick mom, probably thinking anything ""I'm sick take care day, need school rest.""

And even one spare thought students, teachers, staff families putting danger. someone else's problem. killing people business saving people business. I‚Äôm shocked. /s Nothing new particular strain known since early summer. deadly. Perhaps contagious. Won‚Äôt make difference vaccine hunt. admire Dr. Fauci losing shit people... Yep great responsibility hard sometimes requires integrity self interest.  black white though bigger challenge much audience, production. Singers blasting droplets stage right front orchestra wind instruments adding droplets mix recipe disaster unless totally isolated pod musicians production crew. possible NYC. guy follow! 

He‚Äôs ball virus since day 1! come said 1m deaths? /r/politics cesspool though happened continued happen, happened first day school, never wildest dreams imagined would happen, people sent known positive kids school

First day planet earth?  Likely fueling*, corrected everyone including author. Indians overly sensitive miss point.

I'm talking test levels achieved week. I'm pointing test levels first several months grossly inadequate. Practically par Mexico. Feel free look archived world meter data re-familiarize numbers. Since testing minimal many months, way infected dead count ever correct, this, present-day published numbers bogus.

For Pete's sake, read post. Sweden aiming similar number, speculative studies arguing NYState coronavirus numbers went 5% immunity?  Vaccines never 100% side effect free, piece deactivated pathogen vaccine, immune system interacting with. interaction cause side effects, allow immune system create immunity pathogen. want work human trafficking division / task force. I'm going waste time arguing ""your lifes ambition cunt? uniform, free pass beat significant minorities cross paths with?"".

Have good one mate. EMT make $13.90 hour, spend $11,000~ get medic, I'd make maybe $25 ten years working. Knowing New Yorkers, faced taking effective vaccine risking getting seriously ill, they'll take vaccine, confidence going public return normal life slowly come back. sure will. like zero concern issues covid even getting covid. fail, new ones startup.

who's gonna fund new entertainment companies? concerts/social events function economy that's floundering? happens largely return tweaks. 

the word ""tweaks"" hell lot lifting you. people value karma real opinions Certainly students back known party colleges/uni‚Äôs grave mistake. Really don‚Äôt understand posts. Throwing people crowded spaces global pandemic clearly you‚Äôre supposed do.... would surprise anyone iq 10?  pretty big deal it?

The biggest part that, think it, means essentially know one vaccines works. Without guaranteed treatments volunteers get ill, need pretty certain vaccine works challenge. therefore exercise generating data, enough data approval. honestly fuck ridiculous, selfish people keep trying open businesses! think are? Elvis something? need stay put watch livelihoods disintegrate like sandcastles tide, goddammit. sick tired tax paying self employed contributors economy! always drag resources, can't stay home feel safe make feel better ourselves? dare put us risk? locate find business owners exactly want completely ruin lives! way keep us safe, guys.  Totally agree, weird Sweden role modell conservatives.

 weird Swedish response ""left"". 

They didnt refuse lockdown save economy. Swedish Public Health agency responsible economy, dont care economy. however responsible public health broad sense, focus coronavirus. example reason didnt shut schools lack education serious consequences long run society individual children. Increasing inequalities, child abuse, asocial behavior, decreased mental health, increased wealth gap etc.

They also used leftist methods fight virus. 

For example april highest number people ever (twice high 2019) staying home getting paid take care sick children. children sicker, guidelines says stay home slightest symtoms. Similarly government made get paid stay home youre sick before. Riskgroups gets paid stay home etc. high school used picture decently sizes ""In person classes"" protest month ago, real surprises here. Yea risky people quicker able see results vaccine works. school didn‚Äôt even minimal protocols. coincidence. read news today announced starting phase 3. It‚Äôs Spanish Yeah agree Befog79 weird Sweden role modell conservatives.

Though I'd case more.. guess ideas window. r/parentsarefuckingdumb ok **you** think that, know it‚Äôs biased message? Theyre successful RBG gone. also don‚Äôt give damn industrial pollution, bigger threat reproductive future humanity unrestricted abortion could ever be. Happy Cake Day! evidence whatsoever parent who's intentionally sending sick kid school Trump follower and/or covid denier? lot people selfish, including parents. everyone basically saying reinfection bound happen everyone.

Those people fools. reinfection *was* bound happen, expected (and hoped) fairly rare occurence. 

Science trying determine rare, empirically based high risk populations like health care workers survived infection returned work treating infected faced massive outbreaks reinfection, appears it'll quite rare, least far 6 months infection. 

Which actually really good news vaccine also grants least 6 months immunity, enough people take it, would good chance denying virus susceptible hosts long enough 'burn out'. Based news, ahead others regards. J&amp;J able recruit double amount participants Phase 3 (about 60k), making possible produce robust data around time others expected approved.

A one-shot vaccine also huge, huge deal. Imagine pain trying rally Americans take one shot - second shot weeks later? even attention span wear masks properly. sheer production double dosages double needles....If J&amp;J vaccine pans out, going speed recovery ten-fold. Yah, Canada would invade guys along Mexico, I'm sure two us (Canada / Mexico ) manage break whole 1 mile. /s.

Honestly, US much military might, one ever reach levels, even US took decade military budget. Military PR Hype BS alone worth 4 years alone.  Everyone left! one wants anymore. make literally everyone workplace wear mask TIMES.

I look window morning pulling employee parking, see drove work car without wearing mask send home 2.5 weeks punishment. complained able provide families due cutting much time, taken safety seriously. family important anyone else, sorry can't pay bills, rules rules.

Also must wear mask even using bathroom. One time caught inventory guy taking massive deuce mask pulled chin (I saw crack). sent home immediately, even let finish deuce. Safety key here. one seems understand serious is. Based data I'd say Jewish holidays anything. What‚Äôs point? Obvious troll obvious. people even US struggle consistent meals regular basis. people homeless hungry. exist even refuse acknowledge it. fact first thought americans biggest food problem must doritos flavor pick makes look like ass, waste trying thoughtful discourse someone like you. lot movement breaks outside...

We could lot schools workplaces US. Might help obesity epidemic improve mental health. It‚Äôs possible preexisting immunity problem (and really general issue making charts readable) give false sense scale since scale constantly shifts fit data chart.

When viewed static linear scale, downright shocking... nearly impossible see animation.

It's really problem Howard Hughes old fighter plane movies made. planes sky always seemed relatively motionless despite extreme speed relative relation camera blank sky.

It's anchor things absolute relate true enormity becomes apparent.

There's cosmic scale animation saw back good job kept bringing new objects static size, new larger object became full scale, known object shrunk oblivion. I've thinking good visual representation data would something similar known static figures like deaths Vietnam, etc come picture dominating, quickly diluted obscurity. also problem ~~murdering humans~~ disposing fertilized eggs IVF treatment. twice many human souls deprived developing growing living aborted year, whatever concerns one two people may voice drowned 168 dB yells screams abortion.

Funny thing is, argument could quickly easily taken care legislation would prohibit fertilization 1 egg IVF procedure, and/or compelling mother attempt carry IVF fertilized eggs term, even previous procedure successful.

This increases cost IVF procedures reduces rate success, also stays line supposed beliefs pro-life advocates.

When pro-life advocates twice vocal IVF procedures abortion get regulations fast-tracked, I'll start paying attention them. Otherwise, simply attempting punish certain women sexually active. Yeah. wonder people realize post SARS2 world going like. 

Once get vaccines SARS2 kind fades background period years, mangled simply left behind America.

Think people getting sick pulling us this: healthcare workers, grocery store workers, meat packers, etc. lots office workers shoved back offices good reason too. 

Doesn‚Äôt matter didn‚Äôt reasonable choice got sick fault own. punished ‚Äúpre-existing condition.‚Äù one things that's really interesting academic sense.

Like example, let's say worst case, determine symptomatic reinfections occur 1/10K cases (still ridiculously high, ok) opposed 1/50K cases (STILL overwhelmingly likely high). information? information change decision making clinical management?

It doesn't; rate reinfection that's remotely plausible change decision making matter. Better spend resources and, frankly, mental energy worrying things *can* make difference rather purely academic questions like this.

(Unless, course, academic studying exact question, case, it!) happening everywhere, USA problem. yeah dropped went $50/month. chance I'm paying $65 month. want live TV sports, i'll take chances high seas wait let buy streaming access single team in-market games. See, nothing hide! watching old ads, one thought would closest compromise stores fast food places selling coupon books (like maccas 20 coupons dollar, coupon could redeemed halloween soda), people could leave coupon book kids tear coupon redeem candy food corporate places like week halloween. bit ""hail corporate"", still safe be, ya know...if choice bowl covid candy...I'd go coupon. JFC. kid $5k covered, thank god. Second kid ‚Äúillegally‚Äù home midwife, risking prosecution practicing. $1500 pocket (and 15 years ago). 

I kind insurance. $600/mo, $2500/$5000 deductible. temp checked go pediatrician kid day (new since I‚Äôve working home since Feb). wasn‚Äôt sure looking since Arizona 107 day wait outside 20 minutes ready us. 

They like ‚Äúyour temp high‚Äù. Uh yeah I‚Äôm dripping sweat thanks. 

I‚Äôm taking precautions masked 100% house, surface temp check seemed like TSA level security theater. So, perhaps dumb question, virus spread via droplets sneezes, coughs exhalation, exactly spread? 

Another, maybe futile, question - world going CDC can't control release accurate information? that's still freedom cuz murca corporations freedom let us die. Murca baby! said people *think* they're smart, reality spent much time Facebook actually quite, *quite*, stupid. bound reach wealthy white areas eventually. thing happening Long Island, low transmission rates occurring working class/minority areas, much greater transmission areas people actually able stay home last 6 months. look way: CDC got message out, albeit briefly, real ways SARS-CoV-2 spreads. going able much Trump administration least tried. Can't facts come 5-6 weeks election, screws '~~Fox~~ ~~faux~~ fake news' get shoved throat every day. dumbest thing I've read reddit week Well, also don‚Äôt go oldest developmentally disabled issues adhering social distancing keeping mask up. It‚Äôs fine long moving around store, pause long checking getting ready leave store, becomes problem. cannot go anywhere without them, due anxiety issues alternative caregiver (at moment). Since kids also infected, want make sure. Frankly, already enough guilt possibility sent school (prior lockdown) already infected. doubt going to? expected 100% buy responsible actions taken large group humans? That's roll. Heres evidence it‚Äôs range 66%.  think n95 mask factories produce gov tells to? Lol sOCiALisM! Sweden could achieved herd immunity

And they‚Äôre saying opposition they‚Äôre anti science Well official data 2020 yet cdcs website. However work government sexual health reproduction and, internally, assure you, numbers down. However also know getting less prenatal care cause many others. big one many STDs going unchecked due people assigned usually reassigned covid months. People also less willing go things consider minor another one. interesting info. going look up, fits I've seen. think forgot Spanish Flu German Measles.. honestly feel good wearing mask, even alone bathroom taking shit, know i'm right thing masking up.

When smell wafts face gets trapped cloth fibers, think brave men women Del Taco preparing food earlier day bother anymore. fact, wave air face hands intensify smell order show solidarity. serious can't take chances shit ALL, guys.

Like gf gives bj mouth mask. causes little bit chafing rug burn that's NOTHING compared brave men women get early make dance videos empty workplaces.

We get together, guys. listen Rachel Maddow everything work get this, guys! Fuck Trump! seen family members close year scared virus, family bonding small price pay complain it. one person family consequential important way, i'm sure get point! think accounts early PCR tests detecting deactivated virus previous infection recurring symptoms infection. Reinfection different.  earth though one second parents would this? stopped bothering this. another meathead, pseudo-intellectual thinks he's important is.
