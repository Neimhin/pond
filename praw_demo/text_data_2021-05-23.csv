I'm simple boy. boss sent link clinic qualified for, went got shot. pay mind shot came long emergency-approved covid vaccine. That's case US, Israel, even smaller countries. Everywhere else low-risk adults still option vaccination.

Of course, since US place matters sub, answer simple. deny low-risk adults option going events everything great. mileage may vary Green label either show vaccination confirmation negative covid test within las 72 hours entering place.

Purple means business adheres regulations like masks distancing.

So either enter place distancing masking need green pass (ie restaurant bar swimming pool gyms)

Or enter place purple lable dont need show green label. Meaning distance mask. (Ie: inside outside market places, office spaces employees, music shows, malls) No, honest really thought before. change COVID still exists yet know sure vaccine reduces transmission. So, take risk, particularly place immunocompromised people frequently visit? literally read title thought ‚Äúdamn, would (potato) chips affected vaccines Taiwan?‚Äù Ya least vaccinated states could get rocked back season, especially restrictions lifted. season may giving false green flag areas. Thankfully I'm New England we're well vaccinated. Uhh.....because longer number 1 covid cases? people saying it. aren‚Äôt, people aren‚Äôt saying it. understand facts work something? 

On top that, it‚Äôs quite possible say America utterly failed public health measures pharmaceutical industry (in conjunction German help) hit ballpark saved ass. Covid big deal spending much time sub? Unproductive. Uh. don‚Äôt make sound metal, lol. Like. eating dead animal body parts eat hamburger steak? eating, then?

We‚Äôre shying away saying dinner actually *is*. wish Canada would take notes it‚Äôs big brother Moderna shots? pay taxes, yes, system free you. 

*But tourists*. would point Paul going first place it? Nothing socialized healthcare, *paid* it. kids following AAP schedule you‚Äôre right. misinformation really gets head every time get shots get sooo anxious used trouble sleeping night before. It‚Äôs getting easier get older, anti-vax stuff makes second guess good science that‚Äôs done protect kids. I've seen people certain subs brag drop nose clear front door. intentional. saying vegans made eating animals sound metal. kept harping killing even though talking that. point small percentage population made choice take vaccine. impacted anything.

I'd like go without tourists. *raises hand* There's evidence that. fact trials found relationship efficacy side effects. Nailed it. agree, probably fine, I'm sure shit going knowing go doctors orders. nothing ""free"", canadians pay healthcare thorugh tax system... pay point service. pay taxes, yes, system free you.

Often right bones. Sometimes pull organs shove stuffing abdominal cavity. doesn‚Äôt sound ‚Äúmetal‚Äù? anti vax crazies claiming vaccine kill them. fantasy world life insurance companies would also know void policies.

Anyway, use trying apply logic here. clarify, VT chosen ""to keep everyone masked,"" mask mandate officially lifted vaccinated people per CDC guidance, individual businesses deciding whether keep masks not. Remaining restrictions presumably refer things like large events masks schools, public transportation, etc, restrictions already somewhat lifted here. really conservative approach people think! instance, pretty middle pack getting mask mandate first place. care? Yeah, got Moderna 0 shitty days, think original logic faulty haha  There‚Äôs also lot seasonality virus. Cases dropped last May/June, too, vaccines masks became mandatory.   j&amp;j felt horrible (103 fever along aches dizziness) 24hr three days feeling like cold. hope antibodies bc rough lol According pulling weight?

I read article saying littering bad, read one saying littering ok.

I cAn'T aNyThInG rIgHt!!! Guess I'll want litter equating offering food hungry child getting vaccine. That's false equivalence. child going starve, need food. However, risk child severely harmed COVID extremely minimal, far less danger someone harmed age 50 undeveloped country. like offering umbrella child already owns raincoat, instead stranger coat. That's accurate metaphor. Obviously instances children live vulnerable adults, risk two doses. makes sense children vaccinated. Otherwise, mostly doesn't.  Giving 1 vaccine vulnerable person impact giving 10 vaccines children. Children risk, opposite vulnerable. 

The whole point help countries resources end pandemic ‚ÄúCredible‚Äù early days never applied.  hindsight know decent amount information speculative. 

The CDC‚Äôs worst case estimate 2.2 million deaths.

Israel? Vaccinated % Population currently Feb 23rd. Since they've seen continued consistent downward trend cases deaths. would say beaten without proven wrong. 

Also sure UK, they've hovering around 2k new cases per day month slight downward trend, wrong champ.

That's going happen, also ""morally wrong"". Chill. high Read article Stay young Texans! Kind of, vaccinating world benefits individual countries allow travel reduced risk variants spreading across borders. 

But think anyone honestly say happy people risk getting vaccine whilst people pretty much zero risk getting (that presuming people think everyone equal, even born poorer countries) evidence that, likely never be.

China blocked unbiased investigations, kept important data one investigation made delayed heavily hardly impartial.

As looks, two plausible alternatives virus first spread humans:

Because going head someone else's kid likely little nothing going yours

Because children agency sometimes need forced right thing good betterment others, reasoning really relevant 

I mean there's literally many reasons matter know Bulgaria specifically, many possible reasons:

* EU countries offered, forced, buy alloted share. countries bought less could've (most likely reason imo, especially Bulgaria relatively poor).
* Logistical bureaucratic problems distribution/vaccination.
* High vaccine hesitancy (although enough explain difference)
* Higher focus full vaccinations vs first doses (same here, enough explain complete difference) World governments much money I'm going copy-paste reply last time posted:

So begs question countries responsible for: responsible betterment citizens betterment world overall? 
 
It's simple something ""morally wrong"". equal comparison young citizens vs poor citizens, one thing. questioning whether country's duty citizens first collective good world first ultra complex question right answers. Yeah guess people hate it, maybe they've never seen good one. believe know bad ones there, I'll tell I've always felt better seeing old one (I've since moved away) frankly helps relieve stress reduce pain hurt otherwise sounds better drugs. old chiro lot, PT, adjustments, muscle work advised patients icing/heating routines, feel like leaned conventional medicine too.

NY Times lists several dozen vaccines development, addition ones already authorized. India - including nasal spray vaccine. focusing on. family awesome! kids making world better safer courage. Wishing continued health happiness! &lt;3 Yeah Texas (had?) stuff like getting shot Texas Motor Speedway. Fun vaccination card, eh? would agree aside lumping UK. vaccine rollout best world among populous countries. I'd argue even better US, generally. problem setting goal like needing 70% population vaccinated many counties never going reach level anywhere close. It‚Äôs fair expect vaccinated people live areas keep wearing masks months end waiting something never happen different vaccination goals different counties makes sense public safety perspective.

I don‚Äôt think CDC wrong think voluntary masking system okay even unvaccinated liars take advantage given case numbers nearing lowest point positivity rate lowest point pandemic nationally. I'm saying people exist. I'm saying nearly enough make 130 million fully vaccinated Americans put us back anywhere approaching started vaccinating. Thoughts fauci‚Äôs statement origins covid 19? rosy national figures showing declining case numbers led Centers Disease Control Prevention loosen mask recommendations last week President Biden advise people take masks smile. 
***But adjustments vaccinations show rate among susceptible, unvaccinated people 69 percent higher standard figures publicized. adjustment, national death rate roughly two months ago barely inching down.*** adjusted hospitalization rate high three months ago. case rate still declining adjustment. comment simultaneously stupid heartless. guess there's little donald everybody... 4 year old.

The efficacy vaccines proven year stave infections - That‚Äôs Major Key, right there. 

I was, sure too, worried B117/Whatever else could spawn something could turn vaccines vials tap water, fortunately hasn‚Äôt case.

India, Brazil, Japan, UK etc countries really suffering issues lack vaccines able distribute citizenries, credit belongs Biden Administration really getting ahead whole thing, think (All mean fully vaccinated*) start breathe breaths sincere relief begin move forward acclimating country slowly beginning fully reopen  Well vaccines clearly long-term (sometimes lifelong) primary effect, make sense say emphatically zero risk long-term side effects humans every age every state health. argue historic/recent vaccines never shown long-term side effects (I'm convinced true though) but, said, bad science extrapolate onto new vaccines. I'm sure counts ""medical expert"" degree medical theory fact arguing thing ""zero risk"", notion exist science, making doubt reasoning this... 18's Montreal. One place ""extras"" opened kids. Ran 9am! I'd like think see BS little (lot?) better some, grown internet. Also people age seem altruistic. know was. make sure cats fed donating needy. That‚Äôs think needy people lesser cats, cats responsibility, random people solve problems.  encouraging hear.   Even origin virus, definitely think point ridiculous stupid make claim. baseless was. 

For worth, know ""Dude trust me"" sorta thing, friend mine's mother works DoD said told evidence fact come lab. could elaborate though. 

Take grain salt think Lab theory outright dismissed st point. watch shot go in? I've found tense watch needle, whenever get shots, fingerprinted matter, never watch keeps relaxed. now‚Ä¶.. Mr. Pringles next media conference? Hundreds similar workers‚Äô compensation claims around country paid workers, benefitting meatpacking companies insurance companies, many argued employees contracted virus community rather work. Minnesota, Star Tribune found February that, 935 Covid-related claims filed meatpacking employees, none paid workers. 

Being MN remember big deal last spring. Processing plants closing many people quarantine COVID. Even ignore severity possible outcome disease, can‚Äôt ignore fact don‚Äôt protect workers, can‚Äôt move product. shutdowns caused massive ripple effects grocery stores fresh meat sell. pig farms euthanizing hundreds pigs processing plants send could make room next generation. total shit show grocery store shelves empty seeing piles hundred hogs rotting away farms news. 

This total clusterfuck needs fixed companies held liable. played well, slow-clap. century happened twice last 20 years. safety vs mental health thing tough. try remember mental health take serious hit COVID causes long term complications, know capable doing. Mental health seems coming vogue nearly everyone every income level forced restrict movements wait products/services become available. COVID hurricane rich people got way lost one vacation homes. changes daily lives equal everyone SOMETHING different gives EVERYONE common ground built tempers cool. 

Like magma hitting ocean. Nothing special. Compared EU rates Sweden average. Brazil improving vaccination rates secured domestic production. would trust person's medical advice even doctor? CDC Covid research anyone else planet. Unless someone even research proving CDC wrong, would foolish listen them. would bordering conspiracy theory. states extremely cautious measures taken. governor declared states emergency could pretty much dictate things would done.  California tech funded state virtual schooling took hold, many southern states rely service industry type/ Manufacturing jobs requires parents work. really, no. Again, lots states mask mandates *months* (or ever) they're still seeing numbers fall right now. Maybe could argue numbers fall little slower, think there's evidence even that. ""Maryland rulz, Texas DROOLZ""   population like that, lot right thoughts. Cost billions dollars, sure cutting edge 7nm- modern appliances use cutting edge technologies. RF chips uses old technology still produced old toolsets. Yessss! love idea!! 550 US deaths per day less 4 US Vietnam war death totals per year 1.3 9/11 attacks per week. guys dont think another kind surge this?

No, vaccines doubly spring/summer tend trend anyways. fall, I'd expect surge.

Also, nature large vaccination group changes dynamics spread/surge, think gives fairly low upper ceiling bounce of.   Numbers fading sure, CDC said many (on right) admitting lie.  Dont think cases come that?  Probabilities approx 10-15 times reported. follow thread. 
After 1st Covid vaccine, felt better within 2 days. 2nd shot, I'm symptom free.
Dr theorizes shot triggered immune responses. 
I'm test subject w CDC Many big Canadian cities walk clinics zero lines weekend pharmacies desperate get rid doses expire. demand high, people get dose today literally minutes effort, certainly much less effort drive across boarder. Ugh, I'm fully vaccinated basically normal weekend (went crowded beach, saw roughly 5-10% outdoor mask-wearing, went bar-hopping, karaoke), yet still feel urge check sub still early Jan 200+K cases daily America. think I've gotten used reading virus I'm kind addicted covid-related Reddit Twitter. Yup. lotteries incentives. also extended unemployment, covid benefits, stimulus, etc unless get vaccine. Swedish data significantly worse neighbors/closest comparators, referenced prime example lockdowns work. nothing special, highlight try illustrate point?

Also, mean country ""has taken quite charge regards vaccination""?

That's point anyways. think vaccines long term side effects, medical expert. Tell boy Goodyear I'm jealous. :) BC handled lot better Ontario. here, we've got longest lockdown North America... efficient strict - longest local government idea doing.  need approval? study approve every vaccine combination get life. one cares kind flu shot got year before. exactly thinking, subreddit also see lot media channels still seen anything widespread usage least know we're side truth free inquiry. History look kindly 'debunkers' Hmm, ignoring primary point first paragraph getting pedantics. meant ""drug/vaccine"" distinction important here. say zero long-term risks anything biology/medicine observed long-term periods bad science I'm afraid... personal experience US opened vaccines everyone wayyyy earlier Canada, drove Toronto Ohio back (twice) got Pfizer shots weeks age group (34, health conditions) became eligible even 1 shot Ontario. :( (And yes, even spending several weeks quarantine worth it.)

Anecdotally, lots Toronto stories multiple online booking systems talk other. There'd provincial announcements saying hot-zone postal codes eligible, followed pharmacies hospitals saying instructions that, etc. huge hot mess. kids alright. What's stopping walking pharmacy getting it?  need get story straight buddy. talking now, yourself.

I'm asking questions pertinent UK UK story. question: pause unvaccinated games concerts? yes, definitely deadly virus more

Ok. Why? spread UK near zero, 21st June (when games concerts continue earnest), likely UK population reached herd immunity something close it.

What point preventing unvaccinated people taking part events contribute spread virus? public health requirement imposing ¬£200 fine 18 year old wants go watch football dad?

Also, kind matter whether think rules apply restaurants, pubs, theatres, sporting activities social contact, things opened UK. Again, restricting requires heavy justification terms public health : vaccinated get infected spread vaccines work like magic. 

Ok, neither points true. vaccines 100% effective do? allow vaccinated go back normal life impose mask unvaccinated. Simple

But talking imposing mask people, talking restricting people taking part certain activities. Canadian army ""forcing"" members get vaccine, I've told they're going withhold field pay soldiers refuse vaccine, several thousands dollars per year.

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure entire force area guy know in. True, great way looking it!

Get shot Friday afternoon (assuming work weekends). Haha true. aunt tried get sister complain nephews kindergarten wear masks. nephew care less wearing mask. Ooh that's possible. I'm even sure trust anymore. One hand people saying vaccines effective Indian variant another hand one variant's strains B.1617.1 apparently evades vaccine. Fuck man sometimes wish could time travel fix shit world. ""if vaccinated, like flu"" would bit clearer! people need cut life. ""expert's say"" becoming overused phrase English-speaking world. right side page see username edit underneath it. Click edit three choices. I'm waiting vacc, I'm vacced (one shot) I'm fully vacced. That's good news. Apparently 34% Texans vaccinated right now. really want drop mask, occasionally do, numbers suck herd immunity far. Texas, knows we'll ever hit something like 50-60%.  think makes reddit good place get information ...

No. Reddit good source information. Sometimes people link good information. look good sources information based read reddit. like allowing main stream media determining topics going see.

The Pfizer vaccine shown capable dealing known variants. getting Pfizer Moderna vaccine may issue, sounds like getting one two Canada.  Yeah think looking 7 day averages avoid day week variances.

Australia part commonwealth. Choosing supply allies (in one least hit countries corona) importing much vaccines possible scummy move.

Yep know spreading back September 2019. could enlighten fact already carry around gps trackers smart phones actually pay itüòú Weird seeing thread die down. Guess it‚Äôs good thing though! reasonable awhile now. think clickbait media, they'd faster never are. cases rising slow pick it, too, even panic bias. Regardless whether get July 4th, looks like definitely hit 70% adults 60% total population vaccinated point summer. Assuming vaccination rate equal across populations without prior infection, likely another ~13% Americans unvaccinated natural immunity (ie: 40% unvaccinated*33% previously infected). 

This would bring population-wide protection 70-75% disproportionate weighting toward older age groups. Thus, unless R0 whatever variant circulating come Fall truly believe may never see nationwide surge cases again. absolute minimum, likelihood COVID stressing medical system ever appears miniscule. Good work, America! fainted mine too. Hope you‚Äôre feeling better. Like said, didn‚Äôt say convinced. like didn‚Äôt now. 

Somebody needs ask Fauci opinion changed. I‚Äôd bet good money would say no. 

You can‚Äôt gloss fact shared factual details point towards nature theory tails Trump‚Äôs absolute insistence lab leak. 

The differences Fauci‚Äôs comments say think say. 

I‚Äôm oddly combative making conclusions isn‚Äôt evidence said conclusions. 

There evidence gives us answer origins. 

There evidence scientific consensus changed. 

And evidence Fauci changed mind. convinced convinced now. Anything else speculation. 

All science works. know: ask something like :

 back march 2020 asked ""lockdown stop interacting everybody?"" 

uh?

what would answer? 

would say ""no get enjoy ration virus?""

**what HELL want say now? let unvaccinated go whatever want?**

Hello mess J&amp;J would probably perform somewhat well, reduced efficacy B117 0 pharmacy went actually knew DAYS ahead going much scheduled mine 10-14 days officially opened age group.

It much much avoid wasting doses. 

Both Pfizer Moderna required special freezers stored. take freezers, can't put back, either get used get thrown away. Apologies previous post got removed link didn‚Äôt work, reposting.

Do little research existing information formulate hypothesis like:

It came lab leak 

It jumped bats intermittent species humans

And two weeks, fall. Texas removed mask mandate everyone else nothing terrible happened comparison states. former. Rituximab. Again. Fauci talks 'sciency' way thinking everyone understand nuanced speech. News organizations misinterpt conspiracy lovers run it.

Don't forget there's lots US soldiers abroad. actually better that, 95% protection infections would otherwise happened, *then* protection serious cases.

I‚Äôll answer matters: Massachusetts leading states vaccinations (or least top three), it‚Äôs good example could culture state government facilitated smooth roll-out. far off, suppose yeah how's working y'all?

Pretty great actually. Vaccine uptake one highest world UK, vaccinated based risk priority, means gone one worst places Covid one best (in terms reducing deaths.)

Repeat hospitalizations deaths, repeat across vaccination types.

That give good, solid, real world data, though limitations since tightly controlled study. could see argument case efficacy might bad data vaccinated people might less likely get tested, could see need placebo group that.

However, find, CDC releasing composition breakthrough cases vaccination type. also releasing breakthrough cases ever recorded, instead breakthrough cases week month. makes much harder analyze, need stick date range vaccination rate relatively stable.

It interesting see works better. Canadians seem think way go. I'm sure epidemiologists study data different countries years decades better deal next pandemic. UKs downcurve quite impressive though, although suffered harsher lockdowns Canada. Everyone get shot Poland due low uptake Time another lockdown... Age remains biggest risk factor becoming seriously ill COVID-19, 80 percent COVID deaths occurring people age 65. get older, muscles become weaker anatomy lungs changes. causes become less efficient comes moving air mucus body, resulting lowering defence system lungs immune systems provide.

 
It thought immune system older people ‚Äì 65 ‚Äì slower respond virus, leading longer period infection inflammation result disease. prolonged period also allows virus replicate overwhelm immune system internal organs, resulting poorer outcomes.

 
But certain underlying health conditions, known ‚Äúcomorbidities‚Äù, also increase risk becoming seriously ill result catching COVID-19. Serious illness could mean person need hospitalisation, intensive care ventilator help breathe, may even die. forget middle class. grand parents vaccinated, parents either died partially vaccinated.

Denmark 16-19 year olds vaccinated along 45-49 year olds. reason young people contribute lot towards spreading disease. time change focus work towards herd immunity. people go weird ass Chiropractors questionable I've ever heard proposing misalignments affect things constricting blood vessels nerves FDA approval even Canada? US FDA another agency acronym? Well end result that, 60,000 people, 15 new infections. see good result

Of course, that‚Äôs 15 people, quarantine event, stay isolated instead playing game ‚Äòlick handrails London Underground‚Äô protect NHS elderly Furthermore Canada given lot second doses yet. Congratulations even without insurance get vaccine right? Given US wants everyone vaccinated

Maybe get someone go say they're insured Yo teens stupid yesterday today. 

But kinda thing - getting vaccinated actually pretty smart thing do. free all, we're based risk priority. think we're giving jabs per capita US moment, combination super high uptake (95% 50s), rollout almost entirely based age, massive amount second doses becoming due, us stall age brackets bit. starting pick though we're 20 year olds next month. slight uptick. 30s 35s start getting vaccinated, decline continue Well depends...

If one person 60000 actually infected went infected 15 people one event big problem. UK getting every age group 95%+ vaccinated opening next age group US Canada opening something like 50 60%

One method gets small range ages vaccinated, gets larger range ages less vaccinated.

I think UK method designed prevent deaths first, open second. Also low community spread still enough time lockdowns eradicate disease couple weeks. Otherwise takes months eradicate virus. Variants + opening presumably.

But, see reason worry. Even cases go looong way go significant impact deaths hospitalizations, especially vulnerable also ones vaccinated.

We need eradicate disease, bring acceptable levels. get hospitalizations deaths flu levels would say enough, anything nice bonus. way around. chiropractic form energy healing based belief cosmic energy enters body head spreads parts body spine. Thats misalignment spine believed cause health issues blocks flow magical energy.

Some chiropractors get chiropractic training much easier less regulated scientific training go massage therapy sports medicine chiropractic label. groups call chiropractors confuses issue either case people practising medicine without real background health medicine. India witnessed wrt reporting fking eyes, estimate 80-100k dying day least 7-8 days now. undercounting , massive undercounting. way past million. Even best vaccines 95% effective, meaning entire 60,000 vaccinated still leaves 3000 susceptible they? Still lower week ago. Indian variant spreading people 30 still fully unvaccinated free anything want, I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre looking pretty good. Damn UK still done 20 year olds? thought Canada slow I'm 35 became Pfizer Master Race days ago facility lots people 30s, 20s, even teens. misspelt science technology really good news teenagers handle ? mean, good case Facebook disaster human race Yup, parents joining anti-vaxx cult, sad power Facebook. That's thing - really radar (I got mine friend texted come) still queues long 6 hours ? mean, got walk-in actually know widespread. far j knew one-off place near  /r/HolUp true last week, quietly opened walk-ins weekends several areas, ok waking 6 get early (queues massive move slowly), yes, get jab wanting outdoors many wearing masks. mention, surrounded vaccinated people. So, yeah... science checks out. Again. Link tale vaccine exports. said uk exports vaccines. Proof it.

The eu blocked astrazeneca exports refused fulfil contract. uk never siad dont allow exports delivery short comings.

Besides fuck talked Australia? Since least affected country need vaccines? 

Vaccine nationalism also means decide gets vaccines doesn't. eu let's companies decide deliver demanding quotas fulfilled fair.

Where contract uk? delivery plan? secret? areas, e.g. Manchester, opened walk-in vaccination queues everybody weekends filled young people. early morning (before 7 am) even chance get though. article,

‚ÄúTo make matters worse, Toronto already suffered decades home Worst Franchise NHL history, end sight cruelty fate‚Äôs hand‚Äù Pfizer large scale production needed. Biontech (german company) research Rough sife effects mean immune system ready, apply vaccines. Buying lots vaccines relatively early. I‚Äôve never transitioned quickly, fever sick delirious waking feeling refreshed like best night sleep years.  Amazing Wow!! Impressive.

So mean 30% population anti vax? variants: vaccine set still stop death serious illness. 

Realistically based cases dropping like stone vaccinated people, even areas high prevalence, multiple mutations - fairly confident going forward we‚Äôve got solution. 

Plus - new vaccines way help cover bit surface area virus, Valneva. Due release September. Scientifically we‚Äôve broken ahead virus playing logistical catch up. exactly stuck conversation... shame BioNTech Fosun putting Taiwanese government position. say wanting kid drink sex early age conservative trait. Drinking bad general, sex understand extent pretty traumatic. I'm 20, smoke drink all, think parent need stop relying Taiwan world's semiconductors. Mostly me. couple days soreness first shot, couple days soreness mild fever second shot. know people think that's worse covid sense. think clear? Fosun cannot legally operate Taiwan, right infrastructure deliver vaccines within Taiwanese jurisdiction. Taiwanese government continued deal BioNTech rather Fosun, BioNTech claimed negations BioNTech Taiwanese government still ongoing. Got laugh people downvoting literal facts confusion match assumptions. AZ delivered promised EU would pretty close USA.

AZ delivered forecast anyone. unexpected. Making vaccine like making pencil something simple like that.  Yep; seen posted periodically past year. Would curious know distinguish variants. wonder Americans always use population thing. Compare Germany then, least third American population also national program. 

Most European systems type centralised system even though might centralised continent insurer's problem pay care. consequence every health care system Europe way interacting borders.  look inside CalJam, annual conference Chiropactors. kinda long, possibly bit dramatic, really eye-opening dig quackery poison pseudoscience shit like chiropractic feeds community.

Both points reductive-- like comments. certain age groups able receive vaccine month ago. So, yes, population matter-- especially considering US much larger under-18 % population (~25%) can't able vaccinated recently opposed Canada's under-18 population (~5.25%)

So yeah, numbers matter. number percentage adult Americans least one shot still higher categories.   Mew taint!!! ants!!!

Older people Canada gotten vaccine way higher percentages open longer. hope every age group gets it. got 2nd Moderna shot Friday, spent day Saturday bed 2 blankets 102 degree fever. good time, felt pretty much 100% today, slight headache. worth wanted Moderna got Moderna turned Pfizer, trying avoid J&amp;J. So, people (especially buying fake vaccine cards) don‚Äôt seem understand cards really immediate proof/record vaccine info card also going CDC database likely linked individual‚Äôs vaccine record. issue would DOB entered wrong database, opposed written wrong card. would definitely ask correct verify entered correctly location federal database. ""religious festivals"" included one millions people India cram trains spend week area Ganges, dipping water. pictures year's event show crowded masks.

They came India crowded trains, spent maskless week million people, everyone crowded trains go home, bringing home virus picked trip. Honestly, feels like daring virus something.

The political rallies smaller - maybe couple/few hundred thousand people, local, lasted shorter period time.

Every single place sees surge likes claim ""oh, new variant"". may true extent, lot cases politicians people bothered take precautions scapegoating local variants excuse outcome behavior.

Sorry, I'm bit salty moment. I'm tired people take seriously condemn rest us live longer. would gotten lost praising wisdom thread caught traction. Left stupid. Also less efficacious Pfizer side effects oh well. No, would think saying ""end mask mandates"" would be. see reason CDC suddenly start requiring people read lines. Seems kinda stupid. know treatments. covid gets bad need considering side effects, maybe vaccine would easier path. think higher percentage young people get shot opposed elderly? might awesome thing. That's international travel. Vaccine passports way resume. already need show many things airport. showing proof vaccination really big deal?

OP talking Israel's domestic vaccine passport system Denmark something similar August September.  would ok eating plants someone described harvesting process similar manner? bottomed 520 deaths per day (weekly rolling average). We're 570 right (all according worldometer). Considering improvements treatment lower IFR general due partially vaccinated fully vaccinated people occasionally infected, it'd reasonable say we're close, quite compared June. Went 2 stores unmasked first time year today, well packed restaurant. (Fully vaxxed since March here.) Felt really self conscious nude, lol. also felt way ‚Äúnormal‚Äù while. It‚Äôll take hot minute realize OK again. Weird stuff. Pharmacist here, same. look 14 I'll ask parental consent. I've lot 16 17 year Olds say they're without parents knowledge believe EU already announced theirs. see dystopian frankly, generally trust governments, especially EU. vaccinated Johnson Johnson March. realize Johnson Johnson effective would like vaccinated Moderna Pfizer higher efficacy. safe get another vaccine now? They‚Äôre insult pseudo science.  I‚Äôve worked pharma industry, chose Moderna wanted higher dose, always root underdog/smaller companies major R&amp;D bring innovation. Big pharma buys smaller players overpays moron reps push drugs (sometimes off-label) strictly profits. I‚Äôm anti-pharma (I work pharma), prefer smaller innovative underdogs. 

I strong distaste ‚Äúmarketing‚Äù drugs therapies. 

I know BioNTech developed Pfizer vaccine, wish could developed like Moderna did, partnered CDMO without Pfizer.  little ""haze"" speak 8 hours day shot 1. Virtually effects shot 2, though braced worst. sure effectively random common factor does/doesn't reaction. want to. ends getting disease dying getting permanently disabled, completely him. new moral framework.  Hey. Icy hot help arm pain. Good luck thanks! tell teachers tell public. bulk cases schools kids exposed parents older siblings taking precautions getting Covid.

How know this? Districts even share names infected. University? think like Full Sail online ...college? People dramatic second Moderna shots. crappy day second shot wife (shitty night sleep chills, body aches headache), ""oh God I've literally never sick life"". Sure, people mild reaction, definitely common scenario many people Reddit would like believe. No, /u/MrDarkHorse mentioned there's parent consent form required. So, yeah, sucks. Likely vaccinated parents getting kids vaccinated unfortunately, smart kids dumb parents stuck out. careful.  So, society saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt obey parents‚Äù? point interesting clearly direct experience area I'll respect opinion.

However, counterpoint. students person, would likelihood completely miss social aspect. everyone else back, virtual learner experience would different.

Probably referring specific extreme subset, would better sort specific school would agree? Wow, **many** readers (and can‚Äôt even imagine people India feel), reading number almost feels like slap face watching.

300,000 people? Give break, people talking vastly undercounted everything is, country *1.3 billion people* getting ravaged way surpassed 300,000 mark? Come on. agree absolutely. Ohio Governor forefront covid-19, better Cuomo's cooked #s understand discounting lost. 

In global pandemic based new, unknown virus, unfortunately deaths. 

If someone aligned ‚Äúdata models‚Äù, media various experts positioned risk possibly 5 10 million deaths U.S. alone, be, relieved(?) (not sure right adjective would be) haven‚Äôt lost lives. 

Could response better? Surely could have. Could cases deaths worse? India indication, yes could been. know guy whose kid going med school could get into. Obviously third hand, says kid good stellar student. There's spots MD schools relative many young people want doctors (and intelligence work ethic well exam).

I think mentioned schools cheaper. spend 4 years trying get MD program. It‚Äôs possible nobody knows point. can‚Äôt exactly get another shot you‚Äôve gotten one. def huge turn off. I‚Äôm trying still chat polite it‚Äôll cause chaos totally cut (can‚Äôt cut friend circle) think potential dead.  rest us supposed hermits rest lives? thanks - vaccinated Midwesterner Traditional cyber school public school system thing exists every district state. mean every classroom online class well, maybe separate self contained class per grade (or 2 grades) online, would teachers class. Yeah it‚Äôs much deeper that. need someone believes science take health issues seriously. makes concerned much stupidity mind open to.  Pretty sure vaccinated Texans like showing kids try whatever keep cases help herd immunity may never get.

There's parent consent form, 15 year old son really want get it. took clever parenting get along daughter. also GOP govenors like Mike DeWine explicitly pro-vaccine point introduced lottery encourage people get it. agree GOP's general acceptance pandemic factor, there's core GOPers anti-vax it. whether relative low amount vaccine hesitancy country bad party depends talk to, GOPers taken seriously  Yes lol? That‚Äôs I‚Äôm leaning. friends get it. So? go war fatties have. anything commend Japan public health successes outside crisis. Lol name. Hi Mikhail second. Wachter, chair department medicine University California, San Francisco tweeted would go maskless indoors three everyone room vaccinated.
If unvaccinated people present wearing masks.
Or local COVID-19 rate low it‚Äôs unlikely unmasked, unvaccinated person might carry virus. worked children mental health issues pre-pandemic. extreme anxiety depression diagnoses, falling way behind school it, causing spiral downwards sense. even one child attempted kill multiple times school trigger.. children care Psychiatrists teams mental health professionals.

When pandemic started, 2/3 children I'm referring able regularly attend school online caught class. enjoyed online learning, able socialize setting controlled. anxious would turn cameras mic's still able watch lesson. One able finish high school remote learning previously process dropping out. 

Granted work well kids, believe remain option kids, especially diagnoses requiring 504 IEP requested. ground.

Neither contacts villages (volunteers) legit unable cope. infrastructure literally can't even keep track. dad doctor / surgeon idea situation tier 1 city live in. Someone know spoke guy crematorium working another village. Dude literally said never seen anything like looks like war something. 150-200-300 bodies day. even able follow covid safety procedures cases. That's one crematorium/burning grounds one small rural town. put perspective, official figures state half amount. Although directly interacted people states heard similar stories friends family well. Especially Gujarat, Maharashtra UP. 90k day many hide.

Which hidden. Bodies floating rivers, helicopters satellites able see burial / burning grounds light night. International news covering this. subreddit went covering Italy Spain US India. multiple news articles varied sources similar headlines everyday. even hidden anymore, conjure conspiracy get information. asked people know, especially people rural areas. happening

With 3.5-4% mortality rate avg think happens country 1.4 billion?! Come man , wake up. gave anecdotal evidence falls line math. believe that's totally fine, can't change opinion, call people working rural hospitals , math , form opinion stopping that. Remember official accounts 31 people died Chernobyl disaster. unofficial count 100 500, 30,000. Shhhhh Yeah maybe good idea world allow one place monopolise semiconductors. go online school expect person public school teachers absolutely ridiculous. seems like chiros always young, *really* helps appearance health. Agreed. Unfair put burden teachers. someone waiting second dose AZ, make sense get blood test check blood platelets count (thrombocytes) day get jab jab every 2-3 days track platelets count? thinking precaution possible side-effect thrombosis thrombocytopenia. Eg. notice platelets count going get symptoms I'd notify doctor act precaution. sure you‚Äôre downvoted simply asking it‚Äôs totally eliminated.

I think it‚Äôs people started associating topic one things towards going back ‚Äúnormalcy,‚Äù like masks, see comments saying like (not want everyone, say like individually wouldn‚Äôt mind *themselves* certain situations future) get downvoted people never want hear word again. date idiots circumstance, nice know front waste time better question advocating unvaccinated children attend school fall like Virginia... . dumb. Vaccinate first.. school person. That's best order operations. Eventually, Adults fully vaccinated. summer, kids spend time home. Adults ones go often work obligations summer herd immunity Adults wait vaccinating kids least. effective strain? measurably less effective, potential even less effective future variants?

I'm saying variants necessarily going prevent us safely returning normal, saying they're legitimate concern keep eye on. implications probably concerned spread general, development serious illness death, increased spread leads increased mutation, vaccine- treatment-resistant variants develop.

The fact Pfizer Moderna vaccines still work obviously good news, thing saying ""there's evidence indicate significant vaccine breakthrough developed."" There's evidence *already has* developed. Different. unbelievable burden teachers administrators, proven benefits kids. Traditional cyber school already thing. that. successfully sidestepped first Covid wave, government faces health emergency ‚Äî 1% population vaccinated far...

Damn Taiwan screwed. way pandemic via vaccines imo. highly infectious variants seem little problems ripping virtually unvaccinated countries handled covid 19 shutdowns/masking social distancing past. Vulnerable people liberty waiting science develop provide us answers. still risk everyone else celebrating. Apparently researchers care moving slow interstate highway construction crews 10 workers standing around nothing one person actually job.  Thanks lot wishes. wish people opportunity take vaccine quickly can. Firstly say yea maybe time eye test decide ignore evidence ? South Korea fantastic job controlling disease (in relative terms) never really implemented lockdowns closed travel. Australia started badly, reversed course lockdowns closed borders. myriad interventions US could took mitigate horrendous death toll, politicians banked fact people would use American exceptionalism say ""nothing could done."" say directly ""don't get vaccinated"" leaders ignorant sicint cult listens Trump.

When Ron Paul recently refused vaccination, Fox News downs plays mask wearing, two leaders come swinging Well that‚Äôs exciting! Agree. Kids sacrificed enough education. Schools among last close first reopen. Yes. Correct. Let's make exist. NYC see UK need driver license drive car, correct? wear glasses license correct?

I want sound unnecessary alarmism see fine vaccinations UK (all) must remember power deadly virus . Italy able pinpoint origin 2 tourists. 2 (two) infected almost entire country.

that clear measures must measures jokes. game big numbers count order win case COVID may work well marketing campaigns. talking games concerts? Seriously?

the unvaccinated wait, believe me. wait mean pfizer moderna actually wanted sell vaccines india would done clinical trials followed approval process country like vaccine maker.

Anyway, strongly believe could spell disaster letting corporations sell vaccines without proper approval. business make profits less oversight almost always means inferior product. bottom line pfizer/moderna dose something 1% indians afford something government would willing pay for. India unlike countries west eu neither rich small population.1 pfizer dose sold EU 15 USD raised 23 next year. Meanwhile indian government buying single domestically manufactured dose less 3 USD. That's strong insinuation Pringles food. hell say that? Follow money  Ok, clear, talking entirely hypothetical scenario exist real world. Understood Israel hasn‚Äôt deployed scale? expensive/complex? Anxiety issues would probably reason bring kid back way around. Mods deleting story reason. Yet there‚Äôs like 5 places Earth using dogs this. isn‚Äôt every warehouse airport using these? We‚Äôd probably cut global spread half did. shows number hospitalizations deaths vaccinated people. (note; everyone hospitalized and/or died covid hospitalized/died things happened test positive covid, note bottom chart)

The CDC stopped tracking total breakthrough cases inaccurate would try track asymptomatic/mild cases since wont ever get test vaccinated slight sniffle Maybe I‚Äôm loop haven‚Äôt seen many GOP politicians come anti-vax. may downplayed severity pandemic, haven‚Äôt seen direct ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get vaccine‚Äù messaging get original post misinterpreted, think edit (after like 5 mins) pretty clear. Oh well. mean, terribly Canada, terribly UK?

In UK vaccination gone great. longer interval doses shown improve effectiveness vaccine, experience trial results suggested. given us possible benefit AZ. also enabled us maximise number people least one dose. We've deployed vaccine cohorts gave vulnerable first, helped reduce fatality 1,500/day 6/day.

What describe sounds like way generating revenue way deploy vaccine effectively. UK distribution constrained lack money.  Wow Japan getting slammed B117 holding Olympic games time? could possibly go wrong? /s

I cannot figure Japan sitting vaccines time. Sadly looks like coming back bite now. almost sucking oxygen way people Nepal dying without it. think one Os summit past days. totally eliminating it? believe option remain place children disabilities like Anxiety chronically ill future. Hell, think even ""normal"" children might better remote learning able opt it. 

Maybe parents need/want take kids world experience months year, still public education available. That‚Äôs chips went vaccines!!! /s  think get say, calling ""just flu"" people immune misleading least interpreted wrong people used argument since beginning pandemic. Going logic, call polio affects barely anyone? tuberculosis people get vaccinated childhood, call common cold now? misleading comparisons like dangerous. take action making sure roads safer, say getting hit car less issue now. lost everyone. Hey ho.

Because clear all. sounded like denying covid Honest question, EU running vaccine procurement entire block Germany‚Äôs 1st dose rate right around 40% Bulgaria‚Äôs 11%? know looks like troll question really don‚Äôt know much internal workings EU disparity confuses me. respond wrong person nothing posted anything economics exposed covid wouldnt top reason why. Why? moderna par pfizer booster. Semiconductors important US spending $50 billion build onshore capacity. new generation almost always smarter last one... fuck im getting old measles vaccine 97% effective, people leave house. Covid masks flu, comparable way spreads, infectious. desperate get back normal. hidden. counted reported. Anyone living tell thing. incompetence testing reporting data nothing else. first 100,000 doses went people willing pay $10000, money go vaccinating people effectively way vaccinate people vaccines, can't conjure tens thousands people produce, distribute, vaccinate 38 million people anytime soon.

It's time stop pseudo-intellectualism fucking embarrassing. ""You dislike rich people care poor people die long control rich"" Sure, fuck it, 7 billion people planet do, too. appears merit using budesonide alleviate COVID symptoms, though yet fully confirmed dosage use asthma (400¬µg twice day).

But yeah, probably experiment stronger steroids know what's going on. overstated everyday life; America everyday life, pickpockets almost non-threat. 

Sure, traveling crowded area, like train station, this. otherwise like there's dozens pickpockets looking wallet Ames, Iowa. US already wide open. Nothing stop getting virus.
If inhale it, gets eyes, virus.

What vaccines prime immune system immediately recognize begin fighting off, chance much replication.

Depending immune system reaction may get mild symptoms, nothing all. extremely rare cases may break infection.

Since overwhelming number people suffer mild infection, viral load low chances spreading almost negligible! Exactly, thread reading happened group specifically *only* vaccinated people. would say 600k Americans, families loved ones, yes, fear warranted. me, would indicate level ignorance would big turn off. I'm sure random commenters try convince us smarter CDC doctors kill millions. cases dropping across board. time get back normal. people think they're actual medical doctors. actually systems differ much. go holiday Austria, break leg ski slope, get emergency healthcare, get flown back home country pay dime smart enough buy yearly 30 bucks worth travel insurance. 

You know why? even different systems, European countries agreed kinda important co-operate. metaphor apt, incapable reason.  described absence tracing, way tracing done. Also, understanding tests came time events, people might infected event all? Reading comments thread makes quite clear America obesity crisis. looking cohort vaccinated people world vaccinated,

Do see completely misses underlying point (i.e. vaccine works)? course everyone vaccinated yet, lets get it!  Let‚Äôs go Texas!! Thankfully kids smarter parents. Seems like good step toward ""normalcy"" reverted necessary.  Ok, mean best way things, system things work.

In UK, meetings indoors still significant restrictions, vaccinated unvaccinated people. There's legal requirement wear masks, restrictions numbers allowed meet. restrictions imposed unvaccinated, would kind middle finger people waited extremely patiently vaccine yet eligible for.

Plus, mentioned, would impractical system limited benefits public health. Back day, health insurance industry made going doctor huge financial risk Americans yet. Today, lot people simply can't afford go. really matter hospital system handle 80s are, unless recent findings changing (I'm happy shown otherwise), still much risk severely affected covid unvaccinated 30s.

I'd love see paper even article goes level detail. impression I've read 90%ish percent reduction hospitalization vaccination among elderly would bring line age group unvaccinated. 30-65 range would higher risk unvaccinated either group. 

But key ensuring hospital system handle it. feels fair not. worse, they're endangering everyone else who's vaccinated eligible be. know long term impacts vaccine. talking about? went age here. anyone walking street.

In cases was. vaccination sites leftover vaccines going expire soon, gave shots anybody walked in, rather let doses go waste.

This happened lot often might think. happened several times little corner California, I've read done places USA. US literally shoved needles arms people walking street times. escorting 80 yr old grandma end day extra vaccine guess what? might give you. heard many anecdotal stories people eligibility group walked without appointment got shot. Japan things way.

As Japan, going age groups. Let's say figure going allow 80-90 yr olds first. Japanese approach figure 80-90 yr olds county. schedule plot calendar. want allow 70-80 yr olds. figure get scheduled. every single age group. figure exactly much vaccine need age group work logistics get exactly need it. every single age group mapped know exactly much vaccine need find places administer vaccine make arrangements deal staffing issues. Then, then, send notices everyone telling scheduled shot 8am 21st 1234 Main Street. ton bureaucracy work through. flu, bro"" constant refrain antivaxxed believe you. anything I‚Äôve read case undercounting there, lot people think real count could much 20x gets reported. It‚Äôs likely several millions cases per day India. fatality rate even couple percent (which definitely low covid it‚Äôs situation medical care available, like totally overrun Indian towns cities) thats already something like 60-80k future deaths ‚Äúlocked in‚Äù per day. insane tragedy lines anecdotes you‚Äôre giving. necessarily. need one parent's consent. sister fight ex vaccinations. thought nieces turn around tell him, she'd take get (one niece seems want it, listens crazy father spouts). technically court agreement need agree medical decisions, he's taken court much less. Even court decide favor, still can't really afford lawyer right now.  Well July 70% second dose too.  Could start flood cause companies hesitant go back office. good hear, hopefully kids eligible vaccinations right school year starts. Even they're low risk, think monumentally important get many kids possible vaccinated.

Realistically, solution ""you need approve vaccines kids fast possible"", continuing remote education kids viable. someone remote graduate school last year, feel I've gotten substantially less classes last year compared previous year. imagine kids way, education vital setting future. supposed mask forever variants? magstripe

In 2021, actually sounds American. people world thinks acquiring vaccines good thing government do. Put different way Japanese purchase enabled Pfizer invest factories production capacity benefits all. 

The world revolve around opinion.  Patiently waiting pony hundreds millions build one since easy would crappy parent put well-being 50 year old another country ahead well child chose create agreed take responsibility for. 

I told child‚Äôs mental health future destroyed doesn‚Äôt go back in-person school. 

I told send back unvaccinated extreme risk Covid due host diseases, would destroy put risk, vaccine protection enough. 

I told shouldn‚Äôt vaccinating kids yet it‚Äôs morally wrong. 

I literally cannot anything right. fuck what‚Äôs best family myself. care listen, call ""insane"".. 

BUT decent number allergic conditions mean vaccines risky. doctors advise take them. 

Which fine herd immunity, yet troublesome don't. 

And deaths close peak, could quite high areas hesitant vaccines. 

All said.. I'm sure do. seems like eventuality happen regardless, point, folks want vaccines, ""start respecting"" virus anytime soon.  Shh, tell parents 

They want think kids capable sneaking getting abortion, too! feel like actually talking kids ask this...but would pick fight? matter matters?   know fact closer 30%. We've seen people shift away hesitancy toward since polling started December. July 4 arbitrary deadline set government, hitting 70% automatically mean remaining 30% anti-vax  see number? Drought Taiwan posing challenge making chips?  Let's build chip manufacturing facility Arizona! nah buy even bit. First cost vaccines ridiculous compared spend buy arms, money COVAX takes must accounted get news every day failures lack results Another important point original variant, data UK showed Pfizer 93% effective AZ 66% effective 2 doses. ""Some"" ""concerns"" ""could"" ""potentially"" mean, probably significant number 100,000 Tracing refers UKs NHS Test Trace umbrella term lots things. One controling Covid cases letting close contacts known, otherwise known tracing. Blood clots kept coming even second dose, eg. cases reported second dose. 


Source: know?

Not really, no. course doubtful AZ‚Äôs numbers match trial numbers Taiwan can't vaccinate crisis short term. need tests. testing rate ridiculously low (#180 world according Worldometers), ramped anywhere near fast enough.

And no, can't blame China failure build testing infrastructure given year lead time. governor made ""amazingly"" safe preventing mask mandates school pro-plague measures. Experience poor predictor success used dumb fuck old people lame reason listen  current recommendations (at least USA) vaccinated longer need social distance wear masks, mask wearing longer necessary outdoors everyone vaccinated continue abide social distance measures wear mask indoors. US state Vermont's Governor recently announced would immediately remove COVID restrictions state reached 80% vaccinated. None seems unreasonable overly restrictive. No, not. way 'morally wrong' take care people charged taking care offering help elsewhere.

It's like saying wrong make sure family fed offering food others. People like think Texas america America, like we're idiot hicks something. I'm still feeling good first dose. sore/stiff arm 2-3 days mild headache hours gone morning. I'm getting second dose June 11th I'm little nervous I've heard hits differently first, also hoping goes good first dose. Either way, excited fully vaccinated similar reasons lot adults getting vaccine. 15 years old, he's old enough lot opinions really thumb control anymore. new kind vaccine, concerns long terms effects MRNA aspect it. knows 15 years old, he's extremely unlikely anything fear personally COVID-19. he's 15-year-old teenager, tends think less altruistically do. mileage may vary, experience 15 worst time ask someone think outside themselves. real talk, probably nervous needle itself. 12-year-old daughter interested getting vaccine altruistic reasons, really afraid actually getting poked. Talk kids? Novel concept, know Haha worries! actually mixed feelings well. mention husband ‚Äúlucky‚Äù get early well caregivers daughter ultra rare genetic disorder epilepsy. Like yay getting vaccine early it‚Äôs kinda sucky reason. worries, wasn‚Äôt taken aback all. Especially since it‚Äôs bittersweet us üòä Yeah makes sense. view terms pure impact bigger cold war (as huge was) example case Ireland real impact imports COVID drastically changed life *smarter governor. longer remote accommodations teachers fall case, many us already asked both. /u/2absMcGay right - maybe logistically doable elementary/early childhood level, MS/HS untenable burden teachers juggle 170+ kids multiple learning modalities time (and administrator, forces position make real shitty staffing &amp; resource allocation decisions). 
 
If family believes fully remote schooling right choice them, look private/charter/homeschool options already exist offer curriculum (or - - use resources pressure DOE create designated school option managed central individual community schools).  dad able working Merchant Marines. Could provide links? I‚Äôve read lab workers hospitalized symptoms, could link confirmed positive, I‚Äôm curious Dw bro got point  ""*No, really""

... uh..  nothing dangerous self imposed ignorance. can't cured.

And sadly numbers increasing  We're 510 right per CDC's tracker. Yeah, sorry, that's insane. choose get vaccinated, assume risk. many people already vaccinated, cases deaths moving forward never close saw peak. Oh, forgot essential oils! add OP. federal government also send military LTCH‚Äôs last spring/summer situation awful. homes staff refuse come work. imagine word got around, first-hand accounts horrible disease be. mean, crushing it. know? Yes, least state (Massachusetts); 50% population (including kids) fully vaccinated 60% population received least one dose. Neighboring states Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey similar situation Curiosity, know expect kids, understanding information affecting minds kids parents differently.  Cold War sure. know mainly US/Soviet conflict, many time thought would lead WW3 plus, know, nukes. You‚Äôre lying. even true post history definitely something worthy discussion sub. I‚Äôm one getting attacked posting expert opinion? Shin Godzilla 100% accurate. telling never heard ""it's flu, bro"" used take piss anti-vaxxers. basically meme. college working minimum wage

It's likely New England get 70%+ whole populations soon. depressing  country train schedule train NEVER late, incredible poorly Japan rolled vaccinations everyone.  That‚Äôs happened spouse ... ok, water dry. Cool talk.  Depends mean ""getting virus"". surprised vague phrase is. I'm sure thought we'd understand (which normal times would totally reasonable), given replies getting obvious confusion.  Premature. 70% 1 dose amazing Indian variant bad enough need 2 doses. overprotective church parents üôÑ biggest problem spread it. many could likely die. 

But yes, live likely develop antibodies. also, seem effective vaccine. 

Could hard bump get winter. follow frozen corpses. One church buddy math professor done Zoom classes Zoom testing. kids work downtown Los Angeles also ready come back school. closer 30% 13%. And, unfortunately, random distribution. states regions (e.g. Deep South huge amount anti-vax Republicans anti-vax Blacks create perfect storm low rates) like 40%+. find interesting. time, going do. 

The antivaxers take 2 years. wearing masks already. 

There outbreaks likely October, November. 

And people fickle petty want masked indefinately. 

And good number die antivaxers lies, many would died reguardless. Canadian embarassing.
First AZ this. People can't get vaccine literally dying people waiting get perceive best. gross. saw several times Manhattan flu season, particularly asian population gone SARS-1. Hardly universal means, definitely happened, US.

Unless one guys sees New York Schrodinger's America, part US convenient narrative flyover country. Could ton reasons. kid hated vaccines probably smart enough fully grasp could helping others getting shot myself. Next try rubber they're glue defense. That's true, DM'd said email explicitly stating police accompanies 12-15 patient, told 16+ require signature.

So I'm thinking trying go CVS, since there's ton near me. driver's license yet, probably get within next week two since I've trying get finished up. could also ask friend see could take me. need chips... get people jabbed already please.. it‚Äôs way would happy buy surplus doses. Deliveries double 813,000 doses per week tomorrow onward, increases expected July. Ask whether he'd tell families lost loved ones COVID whether they're collectively lying. still says they're fake, worth giving time day. young people much dedicated get vaxed older generation Texas excluded CDC demographic data, explained source page bottom comment. would put 75%, agree thoughts. think concentrating medical care workers worldwide important, life someone general public poor country contribute research vaccines valuable rich one contribute, surely? Also, countries vaccinating delivery routes vaccination centres set up, others lockdowns prepared go one. wouldn‚Äôt worried health perspective. would ‚ÄúIs person dipshit?‚Äù perspective. Def mis understood. meant heart goes kids overbearing parents kids locked stricter parents worse actually locked in. Pay wall. ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù don‚Äôt mean perfect immunity eradication. 

I mean herd effect diseases like influenza. 

New variants also occur focus vaccinating elderly high risk individuals globally first, opposed letting countries take care countries first. 

Those hold rights vaccines ones hold cards. comment Pfizer probably badly worded, said AstraZeneca, scientists developing vaccines think used morally wrong ways, perhaps rethink research with. imagine covid vaccination eventually roll risk calculation algorithms full FDA approval happens weeks. 

I imagine almost certainly apply new policies, term life rates usually locked-in premium, probably won‚Äôt apply existing policies. 

But knows, maybe they‚Äôll incentivize people lowering rates existing policies offloading cost making newer unvaccinated policies even higher. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø Alrighty, I‚Äôll try address points.

1. talking costs locking down, costs covid itself. cost covid largely borne old, well already unwell moderate degree middle aged. Yes, young people get sick covid actual disease broadly far significant old. would argue point. Again, we‚Äôre talking lockdown costs (and perks), covid itself. Covid reduction avoidance benefits accrue mostly older, vulnerable generations. middle aged people get ill die covid (and tipping point aggregate cost benefit may reside somewhere group), risk exponential get older ICU admissions deaths people retirement age.

2. Older people universally high financial assets, old people may fact suffering financially this. make claim universal, trying portray argument dishonest. make claim many older people longer working living financial assets benefited lockdown. you‚Äôre older homeowner stocks bonds, likely windfall central banks cut rates zero injected massive QE markets, spiking asset prices. Young people ones pay asset rich, price assets (and expected future return) gotten bad. serious belief damage entire economic trajectory generation.

3. Older people finished careers impacted interruption work schooling happened - workforce, nothing interrupt there, educated, nothing either. Many probably really experience impact socially - less educated productive workforce weakens nation, slow effect may live see. Young people absolutely feel that, socially personally many careers education directly compromised.

4. know full well ‚Äòno old people society‚Äô comment thought experiment criticism wasn‚Äôt disingenuous. simply demonstrate absence large older population covid avoidance benefits lockdown well worth costs, would one groups aggregate harmed lockdowns benefit covid avoidance. 

I understand issue lot emotional investment due sick child, I‚Äôm glad lockdowns helped protect - I‚Äôm sure ignoring aggregate reality young people bore brunt lockdown costs old people got vast majority benefit necessary still personally happy (due situation) lockdowns happened. Thrombocytopenia kind clotting cascade kinda last thing happens. wouldn‚Äôt make good early warning. may never know actual numbers, I'm going dwell subject. sad people India hoping day gets little better country. Hi all, UK resident here.

There‚Äôs possibility able get vaccinated another country. would get vaccine status updated done via NHS. assume would wait get vaccinated UK status show? Drought mean rain means abnormally low rain. still mean receive alot rain, relative high amount normally get. still cause water shortages, however, due water management based high level rainfall. Droughts happen anywhere. That‚Äôs compliance issue all. It‚Äôs availability issue. state, it‚Äôs less month since younger people could even get appointment. older generations getting shots since February. Obviously rates vaccinations higher older crowd. Yup, problem keeping everything locked indefinite amount time. need think social economic costs indefinite lockdowns, impact since stay home forever never interact outside world. That's good point consider. perspective U.S. employment markets quite competitive. Hardly month goes get unsolicited job offer. fair. absolutely fair. is, hope us Americans took advantage opportunity get vaccinated may have, small way, helped countries lucky.

Hang there! didn‚Äôt know could that. answer question, don‚Äôt believe virus real I‚Äôm Russian bot singlehandedly rigged 2016 election, expect Thats bit reductive, old argument confuses policy personal choice.

The statement made children low risk serious illness, whereas older people are.much higher risk. trade difference vaccinating one's country. 

The US particularly inward looking vaccine distribution. Almost vaccinations Canada came EU example. Nah, chronic pain issue, go actual doctor get issue fixed managed. awful knees running career. orthopedic doctor told wear good fitting shoes, inserts, knee brace, wow, pain nearly gone. went chiropractor massaged it, felt fine day, came back next day. Tried convince regular appointments would help.

Chiropractors racket making money. can't solve chronic issues massage week.

Vaccinated people still infected spreading virus, symptoms less severe, right? last year so, told infections teenagers extremely mild, mostly asymptomatic even.

Soo... change exactly? necessarily, something like NZ maybe. experience turned bunch us older pandemic-denying morons, they're better without Curevac loves blame US production rollout.  think comment responded meant feel controlling parents time stuck home them, everyone keeping kids home safe controlling.

We yet know gotten low enough allow reinfection. We're year getting hint surge re-infections expect start seeing getting close immunity waning, likely least 18 months - 2 years minimum multiple years. value facebook woo science. That's awesome hear. felt huge wave relief first. Thank well, glad taken care :) checked pollen levels area?

just pure chance ,this worst outdoor allergen season I've encountered years area. sniffly nose every day pollen outdoor allergens. personally, allergy symptoms make congested although cannot testify that's feelings feeling. Yeah still like reading cause positive news makes happy kills time work. Thanks posts. Learned lot probably vaccinated Damn, people commenting without even reading headline. Okay factories? Lmao Colds still there. considerate limiting interactions people. Covid not, nobody wants cold either. point?

Are vaccinated?

If so, no-one higher risk unvaccinated? Participation EU procurement scheme mandatory member states. opt parts purchases. countries Eastern Europe opted (part of) BioNTech purchases due cost storage concerns instead decided rely AstraZeneca early stages. work well. (though booking system bureaucratic nightmare)

LOL not. ones refused wear political leaders told ones made political lol I'm UK government. send vaccines abroad, I'm control. China's medical infrastructure different US--there commonly regular ""doctors offices"" cold, go Hospital. need update prescription allergy meds, go hospital. 

The symptoms also correlate every seasonal flu/cold too. It‚Äôs you‚Äôd infection time birth associated higher rates fetal death, preterm birth, preeclampsia emergency Cesarean delivery. additional adverse neonatal outcomes, related preterm delivery. Pregnant women counseled regarding risks SARS-COV-2 infection considered priority vaccination. tremendous relief finally get second shot behind me. travel hour get mine, entire ride back work location listening music radio enjoying carefree feeling felt year.

Thanks part hope side effects minimal you. Public transport doctors offices seem like kind places it‚Äôs still good idea. You‚Äôre often crammed like human sardines former, people likely actually sick latter. 

It‚Äôs taken week people come terms here, I‚Äôm definitely seeing fewer masks ‚ÄúI‚Äôm vaccinated‚Äù buttons even retail staff, nice. they're summiting now, they've base camp now. assume outbreak happening crews summit 2 weeks now. That's lot people I've met want. want lockdowns go away, want everyone wear masks forever, miss pre-covid life. like everyone stressed hidden away feel, makes feel like fit in. use doses distributing locally yet athletes staff vaccinated. Problem solved. 15 cases prior screening...  sure could argue that. disrupted life every human planet meaningful way. 15 60,000? fucking delusional. Cold War kind slow buildup, always lurking background. geopolitics core, aside notable incidents, wasn‚Äôt much daily life disrupter this. 

Covid impacting world event since WWII. question. Nothing else even comes close. 

Think way. Weddings cancelled rationing WWII. Sports cancelled draft, lack men. first time since WWII sports weddings cancelled, time either things *close* happening. UK gotten enough vaccines vaccinate everyone 12+ likely start vaccinations time immunity summer holidays?

They aren‚Äôt sending vaccines India...  remarkable virus clearly ""designed Japanese"" ravages country want vaccine is. virus spread proof they're like everyone else. dividing line 18 makes decent amount sense. could 20, 25, 18 good enough. Herd immunity relevant. doubtful we'll ever get due vaccines strong enough, virus mutating fast, uptake never high enough. We're considering herd immunity UK likely goal. virus remain endemic, could spike new variants occur. That's biggest risk, risk mitigated global vaccination. problem time vaccinate children, cries booster jabs coming autumn. get locked cycle vaccinating citizens, frivolously chasing perfection expense world. Pfizer making vaccine make money. Shipping vaccines countries pay nothing them. see many people two bad reactions though. San Antonio, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, El Paso? Austin important city Texas. fact 4th populous Yeah, went weekend never looked that's norm past year so. nice feeling. WHO: scandalous vaccines goes rich countries

Also WHO: [Europe‚Äôs vaccination roll-out Go back safe space /R/realmichigan spring, ""I got Phizzerr"" posts goodbyes. know it. still mask mandate work service organization. reviewing mask policy now, still masking can't socially distance inside. assume CDC made recommendations businesses jumped yet. Government's need realise honest upfront general public like better it. government shit job admitted straight away, long fuck constantly would likely vote it.


We need full transparency comes issues public health actual human beings make fun people experiencing natural disaster.  They've found proven natural immunity wanes though, we'll never reach herd immunity natural means. People need get vaccinated. Snowstorm predicted. Much harder wildfires, especially they're started man. Awesome. weird I'm nervous excited time, lol, like feels good knowing helping things get back normal know? FDA needs prioritize vaccine approval school aged kids next month so. Otherwise kids going able get 2 doses time start school year. surprised teacher unions latch onto either delay start school year extend remote learning again. old also risk. anyone 39, they're getting vaccinated favor everyone else statistically speaking. 65, lot personal self interest getting vaccinated probably know lot peers bad outcomes covid. JBS beef Texas anyone curious. doesn‚Äôt Japan join 19th century start fucking vaccinating? PRC posing challenge drought. drought long time az fab running.

In fact, hear something tsmc building water desalination plant?  Young people definitely liberal/left older generations, think people rude awakening comes groups future voters. come red area, friends family consider Republicans/conservatives, plenty pro-vaccine attracted Democratic Party/politicians least.

The media spends lot time focusing crazies party, sizable portion base pretty normal interested left all. one better.....they keep mask mandate month *and* *a* *week* longer. You‚Äôre always going risk. understand sucks feel that. can‚Äôt keep world locked forever. That‚Äôs life. It‚Äôs fair. Hmm‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt speak flat-Earthers, lot vaccine resistance grandparents time.

Hybrid pretty successful district! It‚Äôs enormous amount extra work teachers, exceptions really stepped kids track normal. went back four days April obviously it‚Äôs preferable, hybrid worked much better expected kids (for parents, still strenuous). true original strain. 


If Canada gets Indian variant, emerging data UK puts first dose protection Pfizer 1/3rd rising 80+% dose 2. 


Put numbers calculations. public health experts better strategies 

Sounds like they‚Äôre working great people article lol Unless mutates. Can't tell serious, people hiding deaths. Modi government painfully obvious happening. Rally's, holidays, etc. tragedy human rights disaster. Glad striving keep safe! Good luck quest! disagree. mean potentially weeks/months *if* CureVac results good rollout working bottle-necked. doubt anybody isn‚Äôt target demographic sub keeps track days weird reporting quirks. come sub often, even don‚Äôt keep track people excited specific thresholds case numbers, feeling Sunday one weird days asked. day knew certain weird reporting Tuesday, even I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs nation state, I‚Äôm even sure way data skewed, it‚Äôs entirely accurate you‚Äôre better comparing previous Tuesdays. 

In general try assume everyone know something people circle know. There‚Äôs always people trying catch learn. Thanks. know children, pregnant women, people went conceive children, included trials though? biologist, reality organisms extremely complicated, chaotic unpredictable systems. never sensible say ""I can't think reason why..."" biology/medicine that's precisely why, normal circumstances, undergo rigorous testing drugs vaccines.

I'm still convinced real way measure risk vaccines children whereas much better idea risk covid, which, understand it, virtually zero. However, valid counter argument would know long-term effects covid infection children either. So, I'm saying vaccinating children necessarily wrong, saying we're sure safe wrong. Yes, flu mutates much quickly Covid.  Time super-spreading! Two moar weeks! due bureaucracy red tape running really deep. Japan gets praised lot things, government moves really slow! Read article 

Seven infected members asymptomatic two mild symptoms.

‚ÄúThis vaccine working,‚Äù CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky absolutely. one worried all. kind people would take advantage CDC guidelines ditch masks unvaccinated people really following guidelines well first place. Plus I‚Äôm vaccinated really don‚Äôt care people anymore. kids alright. Talking friend far, far worse. Half people cousins apartment building died. 5% own. bigger issue heavily impoverished/rural regions deaths counted all. Testing low, any, doctor/government worker seen.

The city referring article sorta developed one. imagine middle nowhere. Canada, we're getting kids 12 vaccinated. No, think be.

There many states 100% open, mask mandates, *months*. also happen generally states lower vaccine numbers. Despite that, numbers still falling, across board specific states. think reasonable suggest we'll see another surge anytime soon? too- tears scheduled son‚Äôs 1st shot received it. powerful, especially awesome see many kids excited get shot within hours CDC approval. thread long-covid kids pediatric infectious disease specialist. 

Looks pretty reassuring clear data previous estimates 30% kids long covid type symptoms over-estimate problem.  Hope state goes endangering public health. closed down, nothing value would lost. nope. true: see vaccines surprised everybody: turns protect 3 ways: getting infection first place, 2) destroying load case passes immune system antibodies 3) deploying army T-cells case variant passes immune system antibodies

result: cases positive vaccinated made statistically irrelevant number hospitalizations (listen listen) spread inside body spread outside body

yeah...the vaccines miracle clear, set standard two possible outcomes ""everyone laughs you"" ""everyone ignores you,"" good chance intentionally designed dishonest/disingenuous standard designed specifically attack/marginalize anyone says anything disagree with.

That's fine, BTW. honest actually going here. trying set legit standard serve basis informed discussion. trying make sure laugh and/or ignore anyone disagrees you. would need true cause surge?

There would need population people unvaccinated, previously wearing masks enough time make difference, stopped wearing based new CDC guidance. group would need big enough spread disease enough make people getting vaccinated leaving disease pool permanently.

While certainly people like there, assert size group tiny make absolutely difference large scale. That‚Äôs meant, said said partner gets covid. unvaxxed risk infected, said person takes 0 precautions life. don‚Äôt want deal infected partner close quarters, even I‚Äôm vaxxed. You‚Äôre lucky don‚Äôt know many people it. Basically everyone know got it, plus their/my extended network lost multiple people. We're going ok :)  Yep, I'll vaccinate anyone 12. *Especially* anti-vax parents want shot. shared trauma bond result generation even cooperative/collaborative already likely be.   Mutual recognition vaccine passports something agreed upon yet outside certain bilateral agreements EU. latter working UK US, there's ETA yet. sherpa livelyhood without rich a-holes drag everest (a relatively easy climb compared k2) also might alive either end climb, families suffering heart ache loss well income. horrendous situation consider, really feel sherpa people, sad fact rich lauding lives poor.  Olympics fail Japanese government lose face resign.

If pandemic surges failed vax policy Japanese government lose face resign.

Rock hard place. Seems like best bet admit one country games (including spectators) without proof vaccination. Better alternatives. Unfortunately, live society elected leaders act disengenuously think get away it.

It time reset planet, get rid elected bullshiter, lobbyists corporation profiting misery.  worth remembering called ""whatever variation"" doesnt mean came whatever, that's first discovered it. zero recorded infections worldwide way. handling item, wash hands. That's need safe. like see people think. COVID disease isn‚Äôt big deal you‚Äôre healthy 50. made big deal us deciding uproot society year despite this. argue ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt know‚Äù doesn‚Äôt explain didn‚Äôt adjust information point (aka back normal, cautious around elderly conditions). Without decision uproot society, COVID would‚Äôve gone way Zika. Note there's solidarity agreement EU countries agreed share BioNTech ordered little. Bulgaria receives additional 1.3M doses Q2 (enough 18% first dose/9% fully vaccinated). Hesitancy seems bigger factor. need vax lotto tie future stimulus vaccinations. 13 year old got first shot last Thursday. history passing gets shots. did, indeed, almost pass two times afterwards, able get chair head knees keeled over. happened front crowd people. would think she'd mortified age, said deter getting second. plain tired shit.

Accidentally also three biggest developers producers COVID vaccines. They‚Äôre also counting people recovered virus calculations immunity. many countries they‚Äôre vaccinating recovered people too. work talking dropping mask policy people vaccinated. hug free year. people shaking hands? concerts sporting events? someone mild cold stay home work get tested ""tough out""?

Suppose vaccine 90% effective compared placebo. People contact 20 times many potentially infected people demonstrate vaccine increases likelihood getting infected. absurd conclusion. 

The important data community effect. many people community need vaccinated order non-vaccinated person fairly safe? want [effective reproduction less 1.   want know haw many people population need vaccinated order push number well one. 

We get data fall climate makes northern countries enter flu season effective reproduction number increases. need regions covid19 completely wiped out.

We well beyond point dangerous kids back school. always risk person instruction, vaccine rates high are, infection rates low are, dangerous part person instruction drive school. frigging often getting fingerprinted figured out? lol ok quit separate CDC site health care workers? two nurses family, one told CDC made big announcement today there's risk younger people getting vaccine heart problems. looked see anything CDC site (maybe missed it), found couple articles saying rare, problems mild, possible particular kids might underlying heart problems anyways. Every time nurses life tell stuff found CDC site, nowhere seen usually sounds like junk got facebook. separate CDC site health care workers, full crap, pulling stuff butts, trying convince people crap read facebook real? -thanks true still unknown. Personally think record keeping vaccine distribution big time flop.
When registered vaccine, simply asked name address insurance. Also age fit group getting vaccinated.
When went get shot asked name sort id needed. Asked questions could faked.
What's point? feel records needed help determine boosters well various vaccine doing. Hopefully China better record keeping 1. I'm US citizen Canadian PR - me, land border open directions. (Even though mandatory PCR test pricey ridiculous, since I'm country hours.)
2. Sorry, people allowed state opinions things quite done themselves? Well, sucks - means 20,000 people whole world talk climbing Everest. :( relayed experiences friends neighbours.

I think conversation productive, let's leave here.   Well kinda, call European countries poor yet they've stuck vaccine limbo like many third world countries, mostly USA hogging limited supply. ceo said masks still required even state drops mandate 15th, probably gonna quit lol World Health Organization essentially criticizing consequences efforts (or lack thereof) point. 

It‚Äôs like school board criticizing kids failing. 

Maybe it‚Äôs time UN rethink global health leadership entirely, forge new path. Darwinism Free markets drive prices down. That's true. industries where, certain price, customers choose buy product.

But comes health, people can't choose buy, choice. either pay whatever's asked (in many cases they're even conscious right mind) suffer long-term pain death.

The health industry America knows this, take advantage, charging consumers ridiculous amounts driving debt.

""Pay 100,000 dead year""

or

""You'll die buy medicine me. $$$ month/dose""

What charming market plenty room competition, especially producers immediately stamped massively wealthy groups controlling collaborating this, includes insurance companies. Vaccine therapeutics always go hand hand. Whether one good (likely not), know, never vaccine situation make sense say emphatically zero risk long-term side effects humans every age every state health.

Yes does, based vaccines work. ""long-term"" effect decrease effectiveness resulting need periodic booster. fact arguing thing ""zero risk"", notion exist science

Sorry, say ""historically proven close 0 be, practical purposes, zero. usually dislike dealing absolutes medicine, vaccine safety looks absolute""  Georgia unlicensed practice medicine law? Also, chiropractor board? people need lose licenses. Yes, Trump Republican party, Modi BJP. phrase ""all roads lead Rome"" appropriate here. wrong people? Anyone creates shares misinformation like permanently deplatformed. cancel school 10pm night (typical) way teacher enough time meaningfully prepare next day.

Bold think school district administration would care lol medical mask necessary convenient people could maybe think republican.

How feel live paranoia? mean, response random anecdote internet intelligence puff get defensive, well, bad news you, buddy. BioNTech give Fosun exclusive distribution rights greater China area includes Taiwan? Taiwan Hk Macao. treated differently.  view humans humans then? clear many countries need vaccines others  Let‚Äôs put one dogs outside every store America. dog says positive keep mask go in. I'm saying UK government basing vaccination rates among children remotely relevant regards wider unlocking. changes I'm it. point government vaccinate children, tied actual unlocking. would separate issue, relating likely approval ratings rather logical action. I‚Äôd rather certainly worth pursuing. ah, think I'm getting confused.  make great case. would country make vaccines kill citizens help people countries sending vaccines still supply issue?  really no. discussion turn Trump, refused mention name LOL. articles nature science take much longer checked published... Accidentally leaked probably leads heavy pressure improve procedures labs ensure happen again, push get international oversite Chinese labs ensure proper procedures followed. purposefully released (imo almost chance case, could even proven was) knows, think kind historical precedence kind attack entire world could see outcome anywhere complete cut CCP outside world, way military action remove current leadership country (if also proven released orders government rogue scientist/lab) currently 75% adult population one dose

This false. 75% number territories, Canada. closer low 60s entire country. Territories prioritized (waves upside-down horns hand signal) Would world effectively cut China?

Lol, likely. committing genocide right one shit that.  think lot people get confused wording. think main debate whether origins traced natural world setting (i.e. transmission animal human nature) vs starting lab leak natural virus labs studying. dont think debate whether natural occuring virus vs man-made virus. want concern small, mostly rural populations, it'll never over. Again, can't kindergarten rules forever.  would hurry vaccination/cure stupidity ignorance.

 
But 50s, need most, would refuse take idiotic rumours they'd read facebook, good. Quick short ignorance danielbot? Hahahahahah lmao know liked get wet!  masks, capacity limits, social distancing requirements, drink standing bars again. Jersey Shore going beautiful, epic shitshow weekend. love it. Someone bragging moving Texas Kentucky makes much smarter people left got funniest thing I‚Äôve ever read. 

Kentucky ranks lower education Texas fuck moron lmfao.   Justice Commissioner Reynders via possible EU start date 1 July met, uncertain. topic also discussed tonight's tomorrow's European Council meeting would numbers China hasn‚Äôt provided? China already admitted third dose needed point article. agree you. Way many people see problem ""just shut take whatever inject you""

Umm, that's perfect fodder anti-vaxx propaganda. 

If people want something else that's approved please tell what's wrong it. 

Remember weeks ago everyone mad boomers taking AZ empty mass clinics Canada? laws gonna get vaccinated

Mine ~~are welcome house~~ boss is. combine societal changes don‚Äôt lead ‚Äúwork hard life retire‚Äù. Dying older isn‚Äôt bad younger, dying shortly shortly retirement cruel cruel joke. enormous amount hard evidence lab technicians horrible unnatural things wild bats. full confessions ""methods"" sections published papers. anyone didn‚Äôt read article goes goes detail ton regions across world. Sounds bit like India. thought immune (I did, extent well. Reports like poor hygiene BCG etc made think maybe are) also wanted India made India manufactured vaccines only. Given kids 12 expected able get first shot September seems like bad move even option first half school year. 8% behind California well. think friend. know saw first hand.

unvaccinated spread unvaccinated. I'm talking somebody family coming home shaking hands arms, 3-4 inch shaking hands left right non-stop God knows else

get vaccinated people, please. wait vaccine available will. 

I said could say heart.. you. I'm mean it‚Äôs still coming China allowed Taiwan‚Äôs law article explains detail.  ‚ÄúA lot‚Äù still exceptionally small percentage people though. direct correlation age plans get vaccine already gotten one wish whole thing imparts real habit handwashing hygiene.  tends relax restrictions immediately getting caught breaking rules lying it. She‚Äôs politics. ‚ÄúVaccine hesitancy‚Äù drops groups vaccine made available them. Look numbers people 65+ ‚Äúhesitant‚Äù get vaccine January 2021, look numbers plummeted vaccine became available. thing happen younger crowd. 

And, again, numbers people already gotten vaccine irrelevant younger age group people didn‚Äôt even option make appointment month ago. highly doubt that, school wants continue hemorrhaging room board money vaccination rates have. alternative, keep kids home. That‚Äôs luxury wealth.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   governments would literally consequences, though citizens various countries might really unwilling buy products made China could sting.

But could government do? China big cut ties attack. know speaking hypothetically, government would unleash contagious pathogen population? know people go bit crazy hyperbolic talking China come on... believe NYC reports separate NY state. cdc accounts state website include city. drop subject altogether? Lol entire sub political. f gaslighting nonsense. thought weird imprisoned Doctor alerted world first place. 

There way make argument China handle appropriately without stirring bunch anti-Asian sentiment like Trump did. also lied knowing severity plan convince half country to...get Covid. 

I mean two things true time: lab leak theory can't discounted, Trump handled xenophobic divisive way possible. people follow path least resistance /inconvenience / personal discomfort. 

If places enforce mask wearing, seems people (depending town). one person goes ballistic cows companies staff enforcing it, gives cover larger group adult toddlers find comfortable pull moment they‚Äôre door.

I coworker say wouldn‚Äôt get vaccine ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want die‚Äù (yet deliberately tried get Covid...!) lo behold, mandatory program got it. Never heard peep side effects either. 

On flip side, it‚Äôs sad true even minor incentives like free taco high traffic area would notably boost vaccination rates.

My coworker‚Äôs high risk mom didn‚Äôt bother get vaccinated CVS staff offered pharmacy drive-thru. That‚Äôs current guidance 18+ started last week 12+ started yesterday, target first doses many people possible. Every person that‚Äôs first shot receives booking second, there‚Äôs reason believe won‚Äôt bumped forward. example, AZ recipients provinces eligible week.

The thing consider vast majority Canada‚Äôs doses happened past weeks, idea tons people itching second dose bit non-issue. That's quite math works, get general sentiment. saw commenting. Given plenty Pfizer/Moderna/AZ this..I almost wonder point 2017, NIH Fauci resumed working gain function research.

Not according testimony Congress, lol. Trump's FDA appointee suspects China?

Say ain't so. :shockedpikachu: long don‚Äôt around people groups larger two three, might that. enjoy it. couldn‚Äôt imagine stuck home long. 
When age fucking hated Summer lonely. friends stuff. parents worked home alone bored. Video games TV got old quick. poor didn‚Äôt help either. Good kids taking control lives. Even better : get rest get well! mainly China told definitely airborne trusted them? ...it could begin supplying doses country early 2022, approval given.

Unfortunately soon according article. Well provided $300M last year instead Fosun, one writing rules.

Why you? Covidiots say ""its summer warm weather. vaccine"".... ignoring fact 2020 summer death never real evidence origin theories though. media chose report. didnt think new process

I'm saying trust put body. someone chooses get that's fine... u people get vaccine attacking ""because care world"" whatever that's problem.  sooooo many people that. Point ones gonna know years going people need stop pushing people get it.  mean come on. CUMO giving 5 million lotto tickets people get vacciene... seems super suspicious me.  bandaid hospital costs 8 dollars test vaccine free... seems suspish too.  There's much corruption government point time let ANYONE put anything body. NEEEEEEEERRRRD!!!! \*cries sweden region still vaccinating ppl 40-50 yr range Kinda stupid argument make though, totalitarian country also free whatever want, also consequences freedom. USA would never cede lands principle, time provide zero support services people living them.

Neither Northwest Angle Point Roberts hospital. guess electricity comes from. two comparable. Someone's bad choices leading heart attack different someone's bad choices leading spreading virus. show wildly successful counts, ratings. kind comedy America wants, he's giving them. Yet continues segments him, like last week's ""What's favorite alias former POTUS?"" bit. drop subject altogether.  impression small pockets UK seeing rises cases. places seeing changes.  sounds awful, aren‚Äôt helping government test screwing not. You‚Äôre putting people around slightly increased risk. Pardon thinking people's lives matter attending ""events"". means open offices businesses obvious potential Covid hotspots avoided months. UK vaccinate population soon enough. Yeah, place wants require schools offer person option that's one thing, outright removing online option vaccines available younger kids seems almost vindictive. Especially since time plan could dedicated district-wide teachers remote fall even need ask teachers try both. see it, nice flair! :) [He's still Trump segments last ""democracy"" joke across globe lol Well article states true vaccinated cares? got shots go back acting like covid never happened.

Edit: change laws regarding vaccinated people course. Eh staff choose work too. work state university joke boss ‚Äúmy freedom‚Äù mask. 
He says ‚Äúwell you‚Äôre also free work here‚Äù entirely. read population anti-vax. Vaccines widely available people haven‚Äôt gotten them. Got it! Thank much!!! wish followed everywhere ! manufacturer ready yet. current ones china imported EU. it‚Äôs pretty odd originated city Chinese largest bio research lab

Why surprising people virus identified place best equipped identify it? know point Wuhan first place virus emerged, too, formally identified. reports covid-like illness months official lab literally research testing corona viruses long ago.

IDK remember Asia issues things like MERS SARS previously, unusual they're researching coronaviruses. Literally every first world country researches them, they're one major forms viruses exist.  Sure, I‚Äôve screwed last 15 months called society. Lost tens thousands pounds still paying tax. shouted even called conspiracy theorist questioning government policy. restart another business. Missed last year grandads life died ‚Äúnot Covid‚Äù (remember that?)

So (as usual) want something me, well don‚Äôt care. Chickens come home roost.  That‚Äôs Intel failed keep new fabrication processes. people, masking turned culture war excuse look others. less actual safety beating strawman. research ongoing. research part eventual long term research.

My point think research done vaccines medications? people willing try order contribute research.

There medical trials new drugs devices going time. live city sign companies this. isn‚Äôt new concept covid, promise.  Bye, Felicia Everything's bigger Maryland. know theory ‚Äúgone viral‚Äù again. 

Is cite scientific consensus changing? figure out? new reddit right side page, click community options thing click flairs..it's there. Yea... that‚Äôs going work communist China unfortunately. several layers this, challenge. First, start spreading lab? Second, way modified natural virus isolated bat? Third, modified, modified nefarious purposes. Even spread lab, modified, may modified part work come SARS vaccine. attempt hide fact spread lab could easily matter people trying cover mistakes prevent fired. Ya virtually 0% chance purposefully released government. Slightly higher still nearly 0% chance released purposefully rogue lab/scientist. Accidental leak lab basically non natural reason pandemic still unlikely imo. Even though know full evolutionary history virus, know made lab. Wuhan Institute Virology sought hospital care falling ill

Researchers studying new virus going catch virus a) unusual b) indication manmade.   comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Ok thanks üòä !! 3 kids pre-vacc age group. won‚Äôt going back school fall. I‚Äôm loss keep synchronized classroom instruction. school district providing virtual instruction. Reentry tougher vaccinated. 

Surely many families similar circumstances. wish would offer virtual option vaccine available youngest school kids. focusing science all. sounds good popular. reflects science, coincidence. guy wants us wait another year two get things back normal. FYI, may *never* reach 70-80% vaccination globally. people catch get immunity way. Trump said worse time. ran lividness long ago. That's thing... LONG TERM RESEARCH!!! realistic risk assessment dead. Bullshit. least 5 times that.

Someone government post issued press release stating this. Media outlets picked reporting actually fact. laziest possible 'journalism'. travesty 'reporting'. ashamed publish this.

No one world brain believes number. one government believes this, they're trying save face. I'm using old reddit, might different version using. Sure, it‚Äôs pretty odd originated city Chinese largest bio research lab. lab literally research testing corona viruses long ago. fact China locked everything quick internally really share much info rest world rest us trying figure going on. 

I get it, hard evidence came lab. there‚Äôs whole hell lot coincidences going on. idk trust Chinese government far could throw car Given ended outdoor mask restrictions last week, interesting masking outside seems still basically 100% neighborhood. really noticed stepped aside fix mask lady walking way stepped street spread away me. nigh 90F yesterday. Gonna interesting see long social inertia lasts it. imagine mass-transit city still requires riders (per fed rules) keep around fair bit. need one ride bus, probably going keep on. No, nothing fear world.

But that's say consequences huge. government overseen thing might lose support people. one thing CCP cares anything else. Chinese people never learn virus came government lab, even turns happened. Private investors along government subsidies He's stroke Trump's ego. plausible theory. wonder we'll ever know. can‚Äôt seem find it. letting edit photo add display name. also experience SARS. I'm personally fine 70%. Always felt realistic many states felt like targeted percentage dropping mask mandates. J&amp;J performed well variant Enjoy summer. Murphy came end even though wished announced week ago. Still unless kids work healthcare, prisons, warehouses effectively restrictions.  agree general, except AFAIK teens like 20-30 year olds terms risk, rather like younger kids. 

And turns seen vaccine studies too. Younger children need smaller dose stimulate immune system robust. 12+ need dose adults. 

I‚Äôm debating vaccinate based risk, relates borders. time properly least started vaccinating low risk younger adults. 

If country even considers delaying teen vaccinations countries get covered, also consider delaying vaccinations people 20s 30s. teenager goes school, participates teams groups, public facing part-time job, vaccinated 30 year old works home. MDW going movie No, insanely dumb would *not* wearing mask make political statement. know, like countless Republicans. Wearing mask harmless. Circumstantial. still haven‚Äôt discovered definitive proof virus came animal, said. coronaviruses, SARS MERS, researchers able identify animal diseases emerged point lack trying, exhaustive search,‚Äù Gottlieb previously undisclosed U.S. intelligence report found researchers Wuhan Institute Virology sought hospital care falling ill ‚Äúwith symptoms consistent Covid-19 common seasonal illness,‚Äù Wall Street Journal reported Sunday, quoting report. nose anyway. People need chill. nose hanging out. Stay strong dude. think Texas families guilt-tripping embedded DNA. know scale under-counting? Lots numbers flying around, reasonable math behind it? Covid19 useless biological weapon, average severity young people, make armies, low spreads much affect enemy. caused issues warships stop deployment large war. Attacking civilians useless wars nowadays last less month (not counting occupation), disrupt military supply chain fast enough.  
Gonna start dropping vaccine projections NJ case anyone interested. 4 days worth data may little premature numbers likely fluctuate next three days due actual uptake rate. used estimates CDC including population numbers close 10 years old 5 percent low. part percent estimate 4-5 percent higher sake consistency stick 2010 census estimate CDC uses. 

5.199 million NJ residents 1st dose - 58.5% 

(5.182 million - 58.3% yesterday)

5.020 million 18+ 1st dose - 72.3%

(5.009 million - 72.1% yesterday)

89.3% 65+ first dose (89.3% yesterday)

At rate, first dose shots reach percentages dates. 

Total Population Numbers(58.5 % Now)

60% - 5/29

65% - 6/14

70% - 6/29

18+ Numbers (72.3% Now)

75% - 6/3

80% - 6/22

85% - 7/10

65+ Numbers (89.3% Now)

90% - 7/17

95% - 8/28

7 Day Rolling Average (really 4 days) 28,330 first dose shots. Like said might fluctuate wildly next three days due calculations based 4 days. automod that, though, get dozen conspiracy theory posts day (hour?). insistence crazy people loudly proclaiming COVID must come lab possibility makes rational discussion hard. Perhaps diversification would answer. Putting semi-conductor biz one tiny island seems.... safe. Nope, governments create monopolies, mean governments monopolies course influence things toward monopoly. objectively wrong. made references mask mandates. said private businesses want, may reasons. Yeah, kidding. politics getting way. Got J&amp;J morning, passed 5 mins after, got picked ambulance &amp; fainted again, spent day hospital fine now, back &amp; arms wicked sore. ask kind medication? Something affects immune system? blood thinner? Good know. Thanks tip. long actually end quarantining for? No. evidence unlikely man made it‚Äôs close enough things already saw animals.

What Fauci says continue investigating possibilities that‚Äôs science.

It‚Äôs also possible wasn‚Äôt man made caught studied lab weak security protocols enabled ‚Äúescape‚Äù. even wasn‚Äôt known present animal studying got lab.

But keeping possibilities open. It‚Äôs also possible virus didn‚Äôt come China. likely? Absolutely possible.

People taking running loved conspiracy theory. great : available 2023 trials good. many announcements like year now.

people **get vaccinated**, please. way free work like magic Pfizer, unless getting second dose problem you, really need legally fully vaccinated two weeks instead five. replied looking photo, right, OP needs glasses wanna try false statement?

and btw, anyone calling AstraZeneca ""indian vaccine"" yet? Correct. classes often IEP required. suggesting kids choosing whether class 2 3. trust me, budget 6 8 10:1:1s always strapped well. feel sick, would go get tested. Public schools job what's best kids. I'd debate even better school socialization, therapies education. type person wants special ed teachers teachers general teaching 16 hours day person virtual make life easier. vaccines last fall, longer virus circulation people develop antibodies. reason believe would another spike. mean, stuck wait two weeks doom cycle, data shows wrong forthcoming spikes. feel sorry people want get vaccinated can't, sympathy people get vaccinated choose to. literally 5x work though right? Like shots mean easy. trying here. ""Experimented you"" little emotional. experiment sense national COVID strategy experiment. would absurd relax rules without data back decision. I've got vaccinated Moderna works, let's save world! blame you! I'm state removed lots local places still requiring masks. Hopefully places drop requirements soon, I'm point I'm ready start choosing places require them. I‚Äôm checking sub less less, comment it‚Äôs usually complain people dragging masking restrictions longer necessary ü§£

I‚Äôve come long way obsessively mostly complaining anti-maskers. Kids required show home themselves. Nobody get log in. least person parent get bus. 


I can't wait get students back person  Doesnt mean it. lose reward systems. Also alot harder convince kid work play fortnite instead. Sure, kids super involved parents might chance. Even then, google classroom work way protect cheating. That's worse thing gen-x. gen-x turned 18, really almost point voting, due massive boomer population. Later generations complain boomers, gen-x younger greatly outnumber boomers, they'd vote. Funny comment, scientific method. gathering evidence. many things look students. union one looking teachers. Teachers deserve one thing looks first foremost. Teacher here. got person kids together first time today wonderful.

Remote learning works *well* really highly self disciplined kids college kids. unfortunately majority high schoolers are. Plus keeping em school million negative outcomes.


Can't wait til first Friday night football game. gonna lit  Literally counting days here.

I‚Äôve noticed places people starting pop unmasked. went work class today studio randomly completely maskless. glorious, I‚Äôm going back every day now. would think looking teachers, true goal would help help students best can. 

This case whatsoever. post locked due comments containing conspiracy theories incivility/racism. Went Cedar Point Friday. think could count two hands many people saw wearing *correctly*.

The pandemic last breath America Russia annexed part country plain sight years ago. happened?  Yup. Switch Health, company owns quarantine implementation, sucks sooo much. Make sure stock lots comfort food go - quarantine last least days longer think lol One good decision doesn‚Äôt make brilliant. Point average teen smarter governor. know, frustrating... Mongolia Somalia discussing something thousands miles away tremendous language barrier. US Canada - speaking language, right next door other! Ugh. Gonna pull equity card. Even better race gender card! can‚Äôt wait get mine 1st, I‚Äôve cleared incompatible medication! feel may permanent prohibitive situations. They'll probably pull equity card. delay doses

Has delay doses exceeded 12 weeks? UK using data shown stronger immune response manufacturer-recommended 4-week separation. jeopardize insurance coverage, however major insurers adding EUA vaccine related events list exclusions. theoretically killed disabled result vaccine EUA status, insurer pay claim assumption assuming risk (even infinitesimal) using non-FDA approved vaccine. changes full FDA approval obtained. 

If believe this, check insurance certificates see update excluded events. children also extremely unlikely complications. outliers get hit tragedy course, chances incredibly low.

And risk kids likely vaccinated coming months well. guess it‚Äôs unknown point applies vaccinated people. Yeah, meant holdout without specific date. CA waiting least know going. think initially ""travel vaccine"" required,but short period time, ""forgotten"" people short memories comes events this. Also inconvenience factor along forged document come play. people want go somewhere, find way (vaccinated not)

Btw. saw sign local Aldi's requesting people vaccinated, mask. less 50 vaccinated everyone store w/o mask exception staff (I vaccinated) wouldn‚Äôt go far. basically get vaccine you‚Äôre going get covid eventually, one way another. It‚Äôs endemic now.

However, it‚Äôs true unless you‚Äôre high risk, probably won‚Äôt mean much you. even minuscule chances complications young healthy lessened getting vaccine.  attended Zoom conference several months back medical literacy population health scientist (not quack, way--someone who's work long time regularly publishes reputable journals) simply *explained* origins suspicions lab leak theory. even give opinion, merely said argument is.

It fascinating watch ensuing conversation, basically onslaught people calling guy xenophobic conspiracy theorist. became clear that, many people, root skepticism people thought labs even exist something. idea ""there labs viruses them"" sort Frankenstein-like tall tale, rather basic fact lot them, exist right U.S. form BSL-3 BSL-4 labs, lot people uneasy proliferation.  cite scientific consensus changing?

Here's Politico observing last week jumped conspiracy theory mainstream ""The hypothesis Covid-19 leaked Wuhan lab leaped original host ‚Äî Trump administration officials people dismissed conspiracy theorists ‚Äî body mainstream debate.""

While there's conclusive evidence either way yet, lot changed since last year. Yes. Compared last year, coming shelter place orders, 7 day average least three times were. got January spike year almost immediately started another one February school vacation still issue. seems like hopefully heading low cases summer, like accomplished last year. price tea China? article months old talking people getting second does. chance cirus mutates strain vaccine resistant real world. Study basic virology understand instead scared. understand it, listen experts, them. ones agree it. can't you. Pro tip: lead Joe Rogan want people take seriously. That‚Äôs impossible answer herd immunity educated guess. 

Also depends personal risk threshold. Probably 60% enough major surges appear risk. 80% better lower risk much different 70 90?

Herd immunity calculated based average number infected transmits it‚Äôs still based approximations that‚Äôs general public health risk. you, personally risk tolerance could higher lower. 

No one really knows. sure 70% adults plus natural infections enough stop pandemic overloading hospitals enough dozen cases per day? Don‚Äôt know. California - We‚Äôre stuck June 15th. would hope would boycott business happen. **MASSACHUSETTS UPDATE**

Notes: 

* Population uses 2020 estimates, such, percentages slightly lag CDC data, however, percentages take account entire herd, higher 2020 population compared 2019's used CDC. Also note 12+ number available 2019 population values. Washington Ho. Weapons mass destruction organ harvesting etc etc guys REALLY trying control dialogue, huh? something money fix. vax 8 billion us requires 16 billion doses (more less). happen overnight pulling wallet.

AZ particular expensive. 16B doses would cost $60B. Compare multi-trillions spent name Covid US government. drop bucket. =-O. realize scale thing right?  Better get Parker House 9:00 don‚Äôt want wait line.  Taiwan needs get act together stop excuses. friggin incompetent china whining Much late. Japan far behind vaccinations cases surging. There's tens millions vaccines storage people administer distribute them. February 21, 2021 3:32 pm

A one paragraph article February indicates something might 'possible'. high quality content. Old article-Feb 2021. Please remove  february article lmfao Thats true. [Partial immunity prevent virus there's also [organ [long hauler blood worry (asymptomatics mildly infected people get too). think depends state made vaccine available everyone get shot. example CA picked June 15th open allowed everyone opportunity get shots plus 2 weeks. seems pretty reasonable anyone truly wanted get vaccine get full effects I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre charge. 

You comparing numbers next testing, pre-vaccine, vast majority risk fully vaccinated, vaccine available all. 

I‚Äôve done part. want sit bar watch baseball. governor said ‚Äúdoubling down‚Äù would actually protest like morons protested year ago. They‚Äôve drug sniffing dogs airports long time could too. bothered, cases declining odds getting COVID low unless engage high risk activities (clubbing, etc). odds severe disease even lower risk category. We're getting closer point vaccinated eventually protecting unvaccinated limiting transmission.   someone state vaccinated there? Population data also bit. 

It really isn‚Äôt important it‚Äôs 99.8 99.2 96 matter. High numbers great! Classic overamplification part sentence ignores context. Fauci using language science values certainty. he‚Äôs really saying don‚Äôt know origin COVID-19. Seriously. people addicted feeling apocalyptic doom. Parents children younger 12: state drops mask mandates? I'm NJ heard news we're dropping Friday feel really conflicted. want bring son still 44% adults vaccinated, obviously people think COVID hoax likely unvaccinated also likely wear masks, feel like son exposed indoor public places. know wearing mask protects people, you, even continues wear mask matter. also know kids get bad, get knows long term effects feel safe exposing him, course also want keep hermit scare unnecessarily. 

How parents dealing this? stats states dropped mask mandates earlier children fared? Almost like reddit owned part Chinese. Thank you! Reasons unknown. Right. Stupidity permeates generation ladder, vaccination/cure needs ageless. honest scientists allowed near documents what, exactly, researched lab withheld Chinese government. Well it‚Äôs Fosun/BioNTech, it‚Äôs like Taiwan buying Chinese vaccines Apologies realised Ireland. hope able get vaccine feel comfortable soon. dilemma teenagers ""I know vaccines lifesaving, want become homeless"" defying parents' wishes.

In kind *shit* society parents kick children getting vaccinated? UK public sector handling vaccination course terrible job. clinical trials, system tested 3,000 people, accuracy rate 90%

Fantastic news! really like gagging time take throat swab...  relevant changing jobs Japan desperate measure, difficult risky. last resort situation. Canadian seen first hand terribly distribution vaccine gone. delay doses may long everyone need third dose. kills solution would simple, privatize distribution let first 100000 doses go willing pay exorbitant prices, say $10000 more. use billion created vaccine everyone else effectively. Vaccinating 100000 would take time all. expected cases would go restrictions eased. still way go everyone chance vaccinated. actually suprise taken long see start tick up. 

The plan vunerable vaccinated hospital death numbers follow cases. 

The Indian varient contributing honestly think inevitable anyway, may accelerated bit. 

The weather also terrible month, making people socialise indoors much more. think summer kicks probably plateau daily cases somewhere around 5-6k day.   LOL fuck  Yeah let‚Äôs never come outside ever again. Yeah makes sense people anxious going outside again. 

I guess safer still never leave house! Yeah let‚Äôs never come outside Yes, 60,000 - pilot events test large scale events could go ahead without triggering mass outbreaks part everyone went tested twice afterwards. would highly unlikely in-force policy would payout. Many policies exclude declared acts terrorism war, would slim angle could see, origins linked bioterrorism.

Now new policies different beast. Life insurance private market deny upchrage whatever want, regardless following medical advice. Work pilot mine? Nope. BRCA gene? Nope. COVID? Nope. certain COVID vaccine? Nope. mortality tables eventually show meaningful association. long view- alter chance dying 10, 20, 30 years.

Now, doubt add COVID anytime soon publicity sake. Many insurers could legally denied 9-11 death pay-outs, would worth negative PR. Yes. point trial events, testing after. Iirc two clear PCR home tests required even attend events. Wearing masks outdoors...

Well, going indoors point, wearing mask outdoors makes sense considering mask become compromised transfer outdoor indoor. So, putting leaving house &amp; taking confident insecure area prudent. hey, laugh away.  thinking thing. places ask proof vaccination negative test. UK asking proof vaccination?  worked on. TSMC building new fab AZ, there's big EU project underway, China working years, (but got right yet).

I would surprised see Biden throw /lot/ money securing supply, though clearly represents security risk tw. favorite part someone else downvoted saying stupid shit.   come always resort death threats right? It‚Äôs boring vaccinated, nothing worry about. approved Europe means European Union, whereas Hungary Europe union vaccinating Sputnik moment. it‚Äôs true should‚Äôve specified EMA approved vaccines does. quite accurate, lots venues offering walk vaccines past week ""I make legal"" - Palpatine want space-ghost chips bro! Forgot zero

I'm seeing mistake lot India. People India group numbers differently. refer things ""lakh"" (hundred thousand"" written 1,00,000.  None vaccines produced US used india. Pfizer moderna trials india doubt astrazenca passes approvals US able sell india.  Both, it‚Äôs effective stopping going hospital Yeah wrote every shot every 2 shots vaccine same, false, specified talking vaccines approved EMA

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That's efficacy works. 

With vaccine see 95% fewer infections resulting serious case number serious cases unvaccinated population.

So unvaccinated group would 1000 infections serious case, vaccinated group initial size would see 50 infections serious case 95% efficacy serious cases. 

To figure many 60,000 would risk statistically... we'd need know infection rate unvaccinated percent total infections someone unvaccinated become serious cases.  problem costs billions dollars takes many years build wafer fab, time done building it, obsolete. also people world capable undertaking project construct operate one. very, difficult situation. cool new thing called delivery times curbside pick up. /s Based what? Holy shit. That's scary dude. Imagine getting Polio something cure right takes 10 minutes $10. sucks. Conservatives like ‚Äúsee? hoax whole time‚Äù disregarding vaccination figures. Sounds like chiropractor second group. would recommend reading history chiropractic.

In either case would trust health someone went way get training unregulated field openly hostile holding kind accountability standards evidence. Someone higher up, said work CVS &amp; go online make appt &amp; fill info, check box, signature required.  America really privatized healthcare, lie. worst worlds. profit care overly regulated insurers hijack funding healthcare drive costs state made illegal insurers compete one another. free market regulatory capture worse option. problem comes laws land profit model. profoundly ignorant reality judgment asinine. American, you‚Äôre way dude. sec thinkin potato chips. higher proportion population believes science. I'm truly missing game... sad truth. total muppet get none praise. Yea. lost bakers dozen relatives scattered around US first 8 months pandemic. There's definitely genetic component. addition,, exception maybe 2, overweight obese. sure diabetics Yeah right. Unfortunately Boris still reap political rewards despite multiple fuck ups. countries like Australia New Zealand held shining examples tackle coronavirus, there's one Asian country setting gold standard keeping virus bay.

 
For year Laos miraculously recorded single Covid-19 death implementing strict lockdown shutting international borders since late March 2020, recording handful cases.

 
But last month Laos recorded first cases community transmission, prompting reintroduce lockdown measures April 22.

 
On May 9, Laos saw first Covid death 53-year-old Vietnamese female karaoke worker recorded second fatality May 14 29-year-old man fell victim virus. privatization awful? say so? point fair less optimal? Use opportunity generate revenue supply en masse instead taking forever roll out. like idea rich getting poor would rather one get least takes way longer instead. Well leads deaths way way higher social costs. insanely immoral. ridiculous thing say - people world vaccinated, wont long time. Therefore coronavirus certainly disease world needs worry about.

Assuming american general level ignorance regard vaccinated months ago.

Enjoy President used steal speeches Neil Kinnock people back senile. senility comments low blow, agree.

And honestly, even *was* senile, Kamala running show behind voter friendly prop 'old white man' even matter, infinitely better know I'm vaccinated. government got shit together.

Most people vaccinated too, moving age groups rapidly younger demographics **are** getting vaccinated places, others soon.

The idea comparing vaccine response point national pride strange me, guess also American. right, however importantly note NHS handled rollout, wider government. People really need start understanding lmao us free market healthcare. issue US health insurance legally carved cartel. US illegal insurance companies compete one another insurers run amok. problem US healthcare state regulations health insurance profit business model. wrong NHS public sector handling vaccination rollout. Rag like aspects British policy governance, vaccine program moving along quickly smoothly.

It may moot however, obviously one country vaccinated means next nothing global pandemic. Even imaginary example, numbers made illustrate point, screening test reduces number diagnostic pcr tests must administered 20,000 2,400. least factor 5x higher.... Lol. Earning privileges told to?  Thx happy get anthrax vaccine. put anthrax tacos now.  Odd, I‚Äôm guy, still. think immune system sucks even always sick. thyroid issues though. That's crazy. free Korea, fairly easily available, positive, even asymptomatic, get put essentially hospital dormitory monitor 24/7. someone seems taking turn worse, get almost immediate advanced care. frustrating nobody accept saying. correct. looking cohort vaccinated people, coronavirus longer infectious disease world needs worry about. far tell, though I'm expert here, Health Canada issue ""emergency"" approvals. Interim order COVID vaccine approvals allowed Health Canada speed process, eliminating usual baked delays. approvals seem issues ""terms conditions"" think that's mostly age groups approved. 

Though, clarify bit, said FDA bearing that's entirely true. Part justification Interim order speeds process approvals reviews international peer agencies. FDA, NHS, European regulatory bodies' decisions bearing Health Canada's approval. like Health Canada acts others approve. They're part network drug regulatory agencies collaborate approvals. final decision Health Canada's hands.   Yeah, got ""Moderna arm"" too, one worst side effects. reading apparently allergic reaction immune one, usually comes earlier less severe second dose.

It's interesting that, like many side effects, seems mainly affect women. stahp arguing anybody worries ‚Äúwhy‚Äù Moderna isn‚Äôt administered much UK, it‚Äôs nothing safety effectiveness. UK didn‚Äôt buy much - seems purely commercial decision. That's bullshit even allowing residents return vaccine received state. Obviously, county‚Äôs deaths 20% 12 month period. putting COVID death certificate make money apparently. there‚Äôs mystery that‚Äôs killed extra 800 people year. understand it, ICU/covid beds, take many cases overwhelm them.  I‚Äôve forced caring folks allowing normal, 2019-style life really special, right top players, touching distance even, player nervous/ excited, feel with

""touching distance"".... maybe best covid pilot! lol Notice economy 2019 amazing. Notice presidents good economies (regardless demeanor) get elected. Notice many places US around world prove lockdowns cause nothing damage don‚Äôt mitigate virus (Texas, Sweden, Florida name few). Notice lockdowns started Democrats‚Äô last attempt remove Trump failed. Notice. treat India Europeans differently.  also, last week cases initiated stay home notices whole Singapore lol I'm sure mean. saying Canada one educated populations educated population utilized? Singapore‚Äôs third world ? fail understand let greedy fucks in, they‚Äôll never leave, you‚Äôd literally kidnap families murder one one livestream, even might it. Canada‚Äôs universal healthcare may problems, want imagine would like privatized, check horror show south.

Our issue rollout shortage supply, past conservative governments dismantled domestic production for, guessed it, short-term profit. wait others vaccinate populations enough they‚Äôd feel fine selling us extras. great. play alternate version: lick handrails LU...with arsehole guess find right senile sex offender run him...  Canadians know form queue well too. Daddy taught us well. What's terrible it? Glad agree.

We ""cost benefit analysis"" make decisions based ""If save one life."" J&amp;J far know vaccine trialed UK SA variants, fall surge. Moderna Pfizer trialed OG variant, believe. remember March 2020 ran counter everything else ‚Äúexperts‚Äù trusted. They‚Äôve lied admitted much last 14 months counting. honestly wonder point india make emergency waiver. Probably, like, month ago ""There Tuskegee study 50 years ago, means get vaccinated even though entire world getting vaccinated"" reasonable position.

Agreed. Interesting view. references? Thanks response. Best luck loved ones, hope stay safe.  wonder people ask apples-to-apples comparison? health systems better Europe general, still different systems country. Medicare US works nationally best candidate expanded national health care system. already 44 million people. Brexit going fine, thanks.

How Brexit going? enough yet? I'm sure Majesty would back ask nicely...   Thanks sharing. Vaccine shopping?? raced get first thing offered never looked back. Escape return somewhat normal life. First fish, chips - 2021 mercy British.  Shockingly, country around fifth population USA likely around fifth vaccinators USA. bad, read article comments critizing US services. Thought reference.

Do know Canada similar ""emergency"" use pre approval?
Cheers suspect lot people dislike take USA, vaccine reluctance skepticism concerningly high. them, makes intuitive sense encouraging people needs kind carrot and/or stick. However, UK, we're simply facing kind problems need implement kind strategy.

Equally, may also people think I'm concern trolling like vaccinations either. hope come across way, may element that. FUCK!!!

Oh wait mean computer chips. thought second Fritos going hard access.

Phew. potato chips. Thank you. guy living India seen deaths infections families know, incredibly frightening. 

And unaware idiots, like person responded to, treat intellectual throughput crayon-welding child solving high-school maths problem. much deeper, darker situation here.

On India city subreddits, uncommon see teens kids losing parents feeling lost sea. People rich running hospital bills never pay off. used tweets asking support children orphaned parents died. think slowed rife human trafficking. 

To top off, India way behind curve vaccination *and* vaccine orders.   Wall Street Journal reporting three researchers Wuhan Virology Institute became sick enough require hospitalization November 2019, shortly outbreak began. They‚Äôre citing US Intelligence report source story.

The debate rages on... fine, thanks. gotta staircase top now. Computer chips vaccines bartering. Welcome 21st century.  Interesting you‚Äôre concerned enough browse various coronavirus subreddits enough use tests surround others do. true, South East Asia now, UK, SA India variants things beginung pop. 

The vaccination program running slow, almost virtually impossible low middle income countries appears global shortage vaccine, well good dose nationalism rich rich hungry nations gobbled needed, more.

Going forward, powers be, leaders world, get fucking act together think better solution fits needs world.

And consider, shit south east Asia, africa absolutely getting nailed.

Covid going ending vaccinated, monumental mental health emergency developing world. kids, families, friends, many getting mentally damaged fiasco. one thing Brits know do, form orderly queue.  need punish young people suffered enough protect elderly.

Elderly? Hehe.

I see subtext comment. Plenty eldery people risk kept safe actions took well. 'young sacrificing old' line argument touted people vocal unhappiness sacrfice time people 'had proposal would effectively lock 20 something's (and teenagers) events fault own.

Whilst wish able join come mass reopening, also much longer vaccinated. They're though...? Vaccine rollout thing British Government done well re: pandemic. see ""antibacterial face mask cases"" popping internet, science them? still didn‚Äôt answer question  Even thought experiment isn‚Äôt good. People remain ‚Äúhome‚Äù leave month, live apartment building still get room air.  whole world simultaneously takes month 'just stay inside', would one create food. transport distribute food. keep electricity supply heating running. make sure clean water keeps coming taps. make sure people chronic illnesses keep receiving medicine die. one myriad jobs completely reliant survival can't done 'working home'. Surely though, that, they're really testing ""back normal"" situation?

I mean, sure, that's going everyone going forward, ideal. greater good, really. Even 'just thought experiment' pretty glaring problems.

Lets start obvious. everyone able stay locked down, care needs prevalent populations must met covid not. Delivery chains **must** stay place enable **you** stay comfortably home. Emergency services must operate. Theres many more, never practical shoot total lockdown eradication strategy.

Also look different avenue, really healthy encourage level fear virus? I'm furthest get science denier, even downplay covid. CEV family, harsher lockdown anyone personally know that, certainly think level fear percieve necessary total eradication necessary. think that's hope, still means there's longer period Indian variant clearly dangerous old variants.  sensible approach seems one demonstrate best knowledge dont covid,

The 'passport' needs show green red icon app Mean either: yes negative test 72 hours vaccinated.

The reason green need revealed venue. 

So folks cant / wont vaccines shut access tests (for free!) allow move about. Schools open Europe last year. need vaccinated go back. means vulnerable poorer countries prioritised. afaik shipped Europe far. yes eventually produced Fosun China. Moderna gave great nap. Sure came aches made nap even better. (2nd shot BTW first nothing) make sense. people able provide vaccination card, sufficient. moving abroad, fully vaccinated, ridiculous get COVID test anytime return home States. absolutely zero scientific evidence support cracking someone‚Äôs spine results structural improvement ‚Äòre-alignment‚Äô

Any pain relief 100% placebo first came said might able develop booster variants need booster wears (the best guesses I‚Äôve heard year). haven‚Äôt heard anything since. right it‚Äôs one done. really Palestinians favors insinuating normal act described way.  Color shocked people spread virus one hospitalized one dies. Stopping spread efficacy matter us. Yeah, vaccines opened everyone US wants one (over age of... ""11 turning 12 year""...) think vaccine clinic looking reason give vaccine. volunteered covid vaccine clinics reason would give covid vaccine second dose severe (life threatening) reaction first covid vaccine. *mild* anaphylaxis, would make go across street actual hospital get vaccine would able treat anything might happen. Ohh missed opportunities CDC, chose go along ""You still need mask distance"" line bit long. Initially foxnews, nypost right leaning websites initially mentioned topic. However, WSJ also topic: portals carrying [the there's truth allegation, see far household go boycotting Chinese made stuff. Oh there's proof. Cochrane database 12,000 studies acupuncture, there's plenty systematic reviews. Here's one pregnancy/birth: Tests really easy get days, curious, difficult get one. go? Side effects? Could breakthrough case, could variety things. way know get tested guess. 

Cases though vaccinated, money something else. Cant call injection? totally agree 95% better 77%. glad got pfizer shots

A single shot, storage without extreme refrigeration, lower price tag significant features. easier distribute vaccine ""superior"" respect. 

The goal stamping covid19 completely. mission needs include remote regions third world countries. take long time lot effort eradicate it. short run racing new emerging variants.  meant joke. People always trying ""boost immune system"" various nonsense like listed, ironic given many problems zealous immune system cause. wife hashimotos mom RA, autoimmune disorders. They're otherwise healthy rarely sick. Meanwhile lazy immune system takes 3 weeks kick cold, least getting bored attacking joints thyroid. avoid flu pathogens, places, yes. I‚Äôm germaphobe, never loved packed indoors people middle winter. I‚Äôm much bigger fan summer outdoors general. used ride subways NYC, would gross out. see lot people poor hygiene. don‚Äôt know can‚Äôt cough elbows wash hands using bathroom. know people want go back normal, reality rest world vaccinated, variants continue pop up. 

Luckily minimal effect vaccinated people, boosters way, people rightfully concerned virus could mutate significantly enough ravages harder-hit countries.

This reality pandemic, whether scares not. real. thought CA communist hellhole! /s  kid wants parent preventing it, yes. 

My reservation fucked system is. yeah parents literally rights. kids able get emancipation. 

Fuck, kids allowed sue alimony.

If parents endangering kids like that, wages garnished given kids rest lives. happening Canada believe stronger side effects like everyone else saying. think Moderna's deliveries air delayed alot there's probably alot fear got first dose Moderna might get second dose. still really dumb avoid Moderna though.  talking that's near 75%? getting 33% effective one dose from? Would love hear vaccine going teens. covid vax sub brigade anti vaxers hard te5fact fiction there.  Nah, got great vaccine. par Pfizer. lot states actually laws like this. currently vaccine scheduling customer service covid vaccines Oregon. actual little scary many parents tried cancel teenage children's appointments phone. remind minutes 15+ right make decision. Additionally, hospital work box minors check registering vaccine basically prevents insurance company notifying parents vaccination. pretty sad. Well she‚Äôs severe eczema entire life, hasn‚Äôt improved despite chiropractic, acupuncture, herbs, paleo, cross fit, thing eventually help convincing (after years data education) try dupilimab (Dupixent), IL-4 inhibitor. provinces require parental consent 13 anti- vaxxer parents losing shit Deaths lagging indicator though.

It's probably close. think see weeks decline small bump south people getting vaccine. 30-50%(depending metric, state, future shots, etc.)of people vaccinated take lot bite though. 100% agree statement. also children I'd like see vaccinated. Well dogs learning, course even drugs sniffing dogs sometimes makes mistakes passengers smuggling beacon ü•ì dog fed. üòä mean that's still relatively high number false positives, it? Assuming normal incidence, end false positives true positives. Read again, told happened. Girl stuff. I‚Äôm actually bit worried didn‚Äôt get side effects feels like got placebo shot (Pfizer) they're trying scare teen obeying. form manipulation. feel safe doing. Keep mask pocket put asked. Don‚Äôt worry everyone else doing. want wear one, don‚Äôt unless someone asks. does. work grocery store masks optional customers employees. fuck ones us live small children, guess. hope vaccine becomes available 12 year. stayed hotel Cancun onsite testing (antigen test) part booking fee. appointment 24 hours prior departure, went in, got swabbed, got results via e-mail 45 min. covid tests still required returning US flying via airline uses pre-verification app covid tests (e.g., VeriFly AA, TrustAssure Delta, etc.), definitely use otherwise cannot check online/via app checking airport going take hella long. Nice pseudoscience. Since lower/higher dosage work like More= better?  good Abe

Is joke? Maybe made immune system good? So, hypochondriac, type thing want see. read somewhere else issue young (20-30 y/o) males, part of. second dose due late august (Quebec quirky like that). Soooo, medical professional knowledgeable person reads this, worried be? also worked month two, would think really help, right?

Or panicking, hypochondria sucks? Yep. wife ours, kid young. Sure...the virus affect kids much...that know of... us, pandemic going alive well child get protection shitty people dragging out. Oh irony. Played conservative past 14 months almost point friends looking funny saying paranoid pandemic. Spent like 85% past year room. meeting outdoor gatherings. see winter lol.

So finally get shot. Get second shot. ( Felt like crap 48 hours done) Wait full two weeks til shots fully working. 

 FINALLY! I'm released back world. Feels amazing went many fun things.3 days later I'm feeling like I'm getting sick.U gotta kidding me. convinced severely bad allergies first several days. Itchy eyes, itchy nose, sneezing, inner ear pain post nasal drip slight congestion. fever. clear sinuses dark green shit. signs allergies cold. 

Now week. Slowly every day feel like I'm getting worse. Starting muscle pain running slight Fever along symptoms. really hope shit. thought breakthrough cases supposed asymptomatic..?

I guess I'm venting guess. Really upset excited get vaccine get back life. 3 days later I'm back bedroom. Idk allergies, (prob since developed fever today) Covid, sinus infection, common cold, flu? clue. know I'm fucking bed room again. Losing it. year clean gambling relapsed today take sitting another day watching shows. There's one exception I've heard of. Needling tendons experiencing inflammation tendonitis help, much way tendon release surgery does. 

Completely separated traditional medicinal reasons, though. wish states got posted. ever see Virginia (because someone sub daily covid update) like seeing Mass. update Dr Anthony Fauci said accounting Chinese may done favour investigation

What sketch site also social distance avoid people don‚Äôt wear masks? Fully vaccinated also last week fly back home Mexico. Got antigen test 24 hours prior flight. Tbh requirement pretty lax, like antigen test 3 days flight departure..you could definitely pick covid within 3 days antigen testing negative right(wrong) timing. Nobody checks whether parent's signature actually theirs. could palestinian ok sure forged parents signature time high school. Sometimes forgot show them. Nobody checks it. oh didn‚Äôt even need give insurance info get mine Japan workers tend stick one employer entire career. Sorry, misspoke. insurance paid $40. paid $0. doubt anything official, probably aspect scientific common sense people seeking vaccine people delivering vaccine. track past pandemics/epidemics well. truly gain control, 70% magic number. weird seeing half stadium packed shoulder shoulder people. 


The vaccinated side versus non vaccinated side big difference  India develop vaccine. problem Pfizer one expensive. I'm lucky im developed country. asked sounded metal you. I‚Äôm MAKING sound metal, literally describing things without euphemisms agreed sounded metal.

Went chain pharmacy first gave wrong birth date insurance 13yo looked sus never asked ID info either us. even told kid hey could bring kid guess lol Preface: know next nothing International Relations politics. 

Obviously, important truth found out, maybe naive, see origins changing anything, like world could send bill Chinese like lab screwed big time, pay damages. clearly shown there's ""real"" effect much lower figures 70%. don‚Äôt make sound metal, lol.

You literally said did. No, shouldn‚Äôt anything like last year, doesn‚Äôt mean won‚Äôt see increase. don‚Äôt know comment downvoted, merely stating facts.  kids went cvs, pharmacist spoke confirmed name date birth, never spoke once. I‚Äôm pretty sure added info sign website.

Like everyone outside military age buckets 65% we'd LOT better. chiropractors give injection?

**no**

can chiropractors prescribe medications?

**no**

why that? ask why? 100% cance cancer years?! foresee time July point vaccination high enough numbers low enough CDC ends mask guidance completely bruh old ?  ""I seemed picked cold something."" I'm 25, male, healthy/active good shape. Got second Pfizer shot 17 days ago, still bad symptoms.

Most concerning would describe inflammation swelling heart area, left chest/shoulder/arm, neck/lymph nodes, mouth

I've intense, pounding, almost irregular heartbeat. head felt like balloon. combine make extremely difficult focus, work, concentrate. like there's clenched fist left side, head like balloon. 

I'm going cardiologist tomorrow AM. 

I've seen reports small % men 25-30 severe symptoms, experiencing things related heart inflammation. Wondering anyone experienced something similar knows information - thanks! CDC still lists places like care homes medical facilities places everyone needs mask they'll one last places mask policy loosened ok Unfortunately well, well past number. saw [this shows dramatically numbers evening 11 April, two reporters photographer staked mortuary 1,200-bed state-run Covid-19 hospital Ahmedabad. 17 hours, counted 69 body bags coming single exit ... Next day, Gujarat officially counted ... 20 end night team counted 200 bodies. next day, Ahmedabad counted 25 deaths. 5 May, paper counted 83 deaths Vadodara. official figure ... Hindu newspaper ... reported information 689 bodies cremated buried seven cities [they monitored] following Covid-19 protocols 16 April, official death toll entire state 94


And that's ones tracked cities monitored. knows many others skipped main hospital crematorium pathways, especially poorer rural areas. Hell yeah, like charm. think I've two patients vaccinated last 6 months dozens COVID patients I've treated. One days first dose, probably caught vaccinated; asympomatic, hospitalized someone else entirely. Lol, really think Scott authoritarian power. usa pfiser doses 3 week. don‚Äôt know see bump less vaccinated areas, considering it‚Äôll warmer months indoor venues take precautions regardless state officials doing, meaning large gatherings likely outdoors still enough vaccinated previously infected people virus might find difficult spread. really think reddit comments saving lives point? Look small audience is. Look even smaller fraction audience agrees you. case numbers positivity rates crashing without help you. vaccines increasingly making ""plead internet-strangers wear masks"" waste limited time energy effect positive changes Earth. Chiropractic profession seems always types people? really mess

I'm thankful town mostly gotten everywhere page switched either mask requirement asking unvaccinated people mask can't get vaccinated wait? Taipei police searching 31 city residents tested positive COVID-19 failed provide adequate contact information.

Ouch. Oh don‚Äôt even give much credit. learned everything ‚Äúknow‚Äù coronavirus vaccine Facebook memes.  Lol, vaccines safe strict protocol. place honestly sounds like shut everything produced tossed. seems like whole facility cluster fuck. you. Well also take account people practicing social distancing masks now, weeks takes time social consciousness affect numbers. saw thing here, everyone control winter spike US, everyone going wearing masks social distancing, things exploded started become control, that's really saw people take seriously mask compliance social distancing point, weeks later cases started drop. Yeah, believe vaccine facility held pending investigation That's thought process. Cases r low I'm fully fully vaccinated + 2 weeks CDC recommend guidance top.

 thing makes think Covid damn muscle aches. I've never felt life phizer vaccine. month later I'm feeling exact spot hip leg calf last time. bizarre. [This Omg slept sooooo much. Thanks moderna Canadian friends, think see normality similar fashion US? reaching vaccine numbers similar them, start seeing massive jump 2nd doses come mid-June. really hope Calgary Stampede, we‚Äôre still heavy restrictions. Seeing US gives hope though. Yes! sun rise Monday morning continents except parts Antarctica penguins prepared dark Svalbard set. reasonably healthy vaccine offers stellar enough protection COVID presents risk flu, maybe even less. 

There's zero reason vaccinated people start getting back lives things world, vaccines absolutely dumbest thing could've politicized. No, people still like that. Yeah closed today unfortunately gotta go tomorrow. Idk guess vent post. understand many dealt billion times worse events pandemic. starting wear mentally room. counting days til two weeks second shot could go out. Everyone said one shot ur 80% good wanted wait full 2 weeks second shot sure. Ugh. things, what's issue?  went one today first time while. wear mask put glove buffet line. expect thought brilliant, hope feasible keep protocols around permanently, never liked idea everybody's germs getting food buffets.

Yeah tried get tested today slots available. Tomorrow every slot open. wonder results sunday's lowest. Yeah, touchless alternatives require close contact person. irony sad thing still huge cult following previous president, *a ton* people still think vaccines part conspiracy. ~~Sometimes~~ want leave. easy ask credible academic: ""are sure vaccines protect us variant?"" obviously say know (duh), probably.

Easy enough ""experts unsure protected variants"" headlines meant something stage. current 24% weekly rate decline it'll 4 days (Thursday) get ""low"" last June (21.5k).

[Per worldmeters 7-day running Ah

I seen anyone math since point like 5,000 would equivalent per capita US. think immunocompromised people bigger concern. can‚Äôt get vaccinated high risk.

Other pandemic viruses ended mutating harmless varieties past 20
Years seems mutating tougher strains treat. 


I likely wrong that‚Äôs feels Maybe generic factor makes people susceptible serious cases. maybe something really high viral load spreading close quarters. thought people wanted Pfizer Moderna? got Moderna thought lucked out. Military personnel US educated peers, actually. rare, bad reaction could happen. what?

Then get treatment allergic reaction get better. understand one died suffered type permanent injury Pfizer vaccine, right? hope aware basic easily verifiable fact. Japan's death rate per million 95.09... thats impressive. Look South Korea 37.17 Austrialia 35.88 - now, that's fukin impressive. Especially S.Korea considering dense country is. agree Japan overrated Western world. see innovation competency known for. Failed govnt policy convoluted bureaucratic system worsening sure. state keeps record every vaccine given central database. covid. Depends age think. five year old court order (for vaccines approved age group) social worker take kid doctors‚Äô office necessary. 16 year old can‚Äôt make get vaccinated. Yep, whole face ached. actually fibromyalgia felt like whole body flare (extreme muscle &amp; joint pain) fever top. Plus nausea &amp; tension migraine. whole day physical hell.  gave 30% population 2 shots 95% effective vaccine results would poor compared giving 60% population 1 shot 77% effective vaccine. 

If get 90% people vaccinated 77% effective vaccine might possible completely quench epidemic regionally. Giving 2 shots 45% population leaves plenty carriers. especially bad 45% demographic group like ""old white people"" 55% unvaccinated gathers proximity workplaces events. 95% effective vaccine still 5% failure vaccine contact 20 times many sick people reason concerned. something along lines asteroid hit earth group saying Russians sent fault.

 Like fuck let's deal asteroid point fingers, scientifically. BreFence Go COVID-19 breath test system works detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) person‚Äôs exhaled breath produced biochemical reactions human cells.

Among things, told stop carrying wallet back pocket, turned helpful. worth it. Wear mask take vaccine. Move brother okay. Got J&amp;J, person work big side effect. Kind feel left lol air conditioning states low vaccination rates, wouldn‚Äôt surprised happens again. mean human behaviour transitioning winter summer, course we‚Äôre going see drop respiratory cases like every flu season. Many sub act like it‚Äôs sign vaccine success story know rates low states. Say folks went holiday beaches UK got Covid live (North Carolina), teens need parental permission get vaccinated. 12 year old walk clinic alone get shot. live (North Carolina), teens need parental permission get vaccinated. 12 year old walk clinic alone get shot. vaccination record system. There‚Äôs database they‚Äôll able tap check someone‚Äôs vaccination status. It‚Äôs piece paper handwriting it. year comes time possible booster go different pharmacy say lost card first vaccination.  sane president now. know, don‚Äôt get claim don‚Äôt understand criticized handling pandemic head state saying public people inject disinfectant bloodstreams straight face. heard phrase ‚Äúif save even one life worth it?‚Äù upset you.

Personally, view Vox video pure propaganda J&amp;J definitely seems worse mRNA vaccines. compare efficacy already - 50% see vaccine good enough.

However, J&amp;J great vaccine. one person put it, tier vaccine mRNA ones tier. Part means delaying even weeks wait mRNA one worse getting J&amp;J. family situation mom, got J&amp;J even believing pro J&amp;J stuff keep hearing propaganda. much better nothing would upset mom, probably right get much safer was. Additionally, one argument agree propaganda videos ignoring efficacy seems increase. CDC says fully vaccinated 2 weeks data indicates far safer 8 weeks. really concerned her, would recommend advise act fully vaccinated 8 weeks afterwards.

On hand, really upsetting due pro J&amp;J propaganda, can't get info need figure handle things going forwards. masking vaccinated people aren't? need mRNA booster visiting countries vaccinated? wife South Africa wants visit family important question us. Unfortunately, can't figure one giving info J&amp;J real world, posting breakthrough cases vaccine from. figure CDC afraid scare people away vaccine give raw info breakthrough cases, feels like twisting data fit messaging want to, strongly disagree with. Still, mom, family, far better position in.  got Moderna sore arm. 

My spouse got Phizer fever, aches vomiting. 

It‚Äôs really crap shoot honestly. People aren‚Äôt going able avoid side effects picking one other. Imagine American refuses take vaccine...

Take vaccine please! Literally tiny states. Delaware, left dust! hear - makes total sense. Thank explanation work! point anti vax crowd hysterical. wondered thing. Maybe science community might face restrictions oversight came lab vs nature.    people NEED fear. guess magic combo easy understand rollout high enthusiasm. Lots states easy rollout.

My state high enthusiasm, rollout extremely complicated make sense, except choosing occupations felt minorities under. cancer, even get thing April 15th 65.

A lot people caught covid waiting rural areas ton vaccine sitting there.

We're catching up, lot momentum lost ended big surge end. kids tell what's going home, especially younger ones. May 2020 started random racing heart high carb meals random heart spikes general, especially standing/walking/doing stuff. Sometimes I‚Äôd vertigo bouts too. Drs can‚Äôt find anything tests, latest doctor suggesting long haul covid maybe POTS. I‚Äôm high risk literally hardcore isolated year, wearing p100 N95 time go doctor something thought nuts, never felt sick all. Maybe something this, I‚Äôm shocked would‚Äôve known. know work 3 cases floor shut down, wasn‚Äôt disclosed us 2 months. Good see research this, symptoms match article pretty specifically ‚òπÔ∏è Don‚Äôt make sound like achievement. don‚Äôt choice. Ask guys forced take anthrax vaccine Kuwait. Wait, people actively avoiding Moderna? Why? Science really something believe in. actually skepticism. Trump moron, scientific establishment failed pretty hard also. nah. allow vaccinated problem solved Absolutely. Go live life, done part. comes point risk equivalent lower anything else may encounter daily basis reached point. Without placebo control group data suspicious. 

There might value randomizing groups getting vaccinated relative efficacy types. It‚Äôs safe admit truth prior administration won‚Äôt benefit right along. interesting. prove daughter's parent local Rite Aid. super simple listed mom pharmacy system, pick prescriptions time. Viral load missing /s, indication irony, yeah Honestly, potential risk dangerous new variant higher countries, probably one last restrictions go away. really even allowing travel US countries major outbreaks. work drug store every single one employees vaccinated. would still highly prefer customers wear masks. I'm vaccinated. would uncomfortable? That‚Äôs odd I‚Äôm hot use iPhone, yet got Moderna. Lol. Guess it‚Äôs didn‚Äôt even know getting showed stuck needle arm. lie age get shot, date birth gets reported state immunization registry. potentially going run trouble later 11 year old wants go college &amp; immunizations can't found/doesn't match actual information. food thought, everyone still get vaccinated soon able! get political, American presidents ruin everything countries' vaccines. ending vaccinate much population lack demand rather lack offer anyway ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è fact Sinopharm efficacy 79%. fact AZ banned many countries. fact China main recipients Sinopharm vaccine far less cases Israel western world. prove vaccine efficacy?

So saying?  guy arguing day keep masking fully vaccinated individual ‚Äúconspiracy-confused‚Äù 70 year old mother won‚Äôt get shot. Like let get straight. shut entire world year protect vulnerable (such 70 year old women) virus almost exclusively (relatively speaking) kills them. scientists bail us creating unbelievably effective solution problem.... continue fuck lives vulnerable don‚Äôt want accept it?  Like... no. no. agree this, remember Pfizer one experienced companies marketing drugs. I'm sure they've funded lots little studies, made sure positive ones got media attention, spun anything potentially negative, basically advertised vaccine would new drug erectile distinction. Moderna new company, lesser known brand, PR/Advertising isnt priority. 
 
There many head head studies Moderna/Pfizer. could use more. I'm probably biased cause got Moderna, reading /r/Covid19positive seems like ""breakthrough"" cases occur w Pfizer vax vs Moderna. Happens low percentage time....but... still every right wait full approval, there‚Äôs nothing wrong that.  Moderna put second shot, brief. Like 36 hours later like light switched totally fine again. case warned sever people prior second shot Moderna anticipate symptoms. almost side effects. don‚Äôt know. expect pandemic won‚Äôt noticed late. Initially shocked returning travelers US allowed board connecting flights return home. would thought sure 2 week quarantine flights China. hindsight, expect epidemiologists knew late virus probably circulating globe months point. Yep can‚Äôt think ways totally abused all

None all. guess also conclude AZ made people vulnerable, can't we?

No hard evidence AZ provides significant protection. Something Sinopharm. failing makes another propaganda arm. world enough need more.

Ironic given post history. It‚Äôs propaganda state *fact* despite head start knowing studying virus, China far failed produce vaccine similar effectiveness many companies around world. Unless Japan seriously underreporting Covid cases I'm sure wards could busy prompt reaction. mistakes medical workers teenagers (16-17) getting Moderna vaccine instance.

The CDC says get second dose got first one already. Although dates birth incorrect, it‚Äôs technically allowed.  One exciting parts living age get cancer, odds survival increase. Unfortunately, there's huge gaps survivorship care even survivors realize affects health often reaches point crisis. I'm 15 year survivor, diagnosed 19, get carry long time. Thankfully health usually pretty good turns little post-treatment quirks, fact blood cancer, made past year+ really shitty. I'm part medical testing help isolate reason many blood cancer survivors developing antibodies part advocacy work I'm constantly even warn survivors coach end permanently disabled getting Covid. really traumatic else it? world decided worthy sacrifices general public acts we're overreacting. hope friends family resources need time. Yeah, lot us. think fact us *look* sick people assume we're healthy. immunocompromised people *can* get vaccine - may effective. got it, hope works well. Anything better nothing! Masks amazingly good, ventilation even better. Right? I‚Äôve thought too. reason beyond comorbitities thing devastates families seems leave others practically unscathed.  Child endangerment letting kid get vaccine that‚Äôs approved CDC yet? Yeah, that‚Äôs really gonna stick court. Kinda hard page areas still fighting high case rates (even they‚Äôre dropping slowly) areas ridiculously low vaccination rates. virus likely endemic, herd immunity unlikely due antivaxxers, I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll ever page time. Hell, within county, zip codes 85%+ vaccinated ones 50%. surprisingly, case rates higher under-vaxxed parts county, might safely go unmasked town, wouldn‚Äôt 15 miles three towns away. (Immune compromised, despite vaccine, I‚Äôm going keep making kinds risk assessments case numbers area lot lower.)

That said: People whole tend resistant change. Give time adjust. would curious know this! whole testing positive death recent deaths may people able get vaccinated I'm betting soon deaths almost exclusively people refused vaccine. Nice Ahh... Man. sucks.  small initial studies, Asians seemed better average Moderna, worse average Pfizer. lot Asian people seeking Moderna. vaccinating kids behind moronic parents' backs üëç could set vaccination pop ups Canadian side land border would also helpful greatly appreciated. Eastern PA slammed week NYC.  cluster public school led early dismissals.  scary was, can‚Äôt imagine felt like two months earlier Wuhan. Honestly that's probably it. see 42 front, NYY.  Sounds like great way getting face kicked you. Honestly can't see hate Mariano Rivera. guess mad team front, Mo stand-up player deserves respect. article mention it, PHE thinks lower efficacy AZ UK started earlier Pfizer 3 month gap doses first. expectation time 60% get close Pfizer said difference effectiveness vaccines may due AstraZeneca second dose rolled later Pfizer also shows takes longer AstraZeneca jab reach maximum I'm pro-gun bro. /r/LiberalGunOwners must never met pretty much every shitty retail fast food manager Never said pandemic. I've wearing mask entire time, social distancing following rest guidelines. way would affect freedom compelled govt receive vaccine. nice try.

You want reasoning? unnecessary. Proper Healthcare without doubt best way fight covid. take care myself, I'm vitamin regimine, cut sugars massive factor compromising immune system etc etc.
I already covid, antibodies. vaccine prevent getting covid. lessens symptoms. Plus incredibly effective treatment methods covid. FDA may say hey, law vaccine can't approved proven methods treatment. given people told us oxycontin totally safe virtually impossible overdose get addicted to, well sort lost vote confidence. conspiracy theory bullshit, proven science. doctor 3 nurses family, worked NYC entire pandemic. trust people surrounded covid govt agency can't make mind. 

But honestly, matter reasoning is. Everyone right make decisions comes health concern anyone themselves. You‚Äôre free level concern, like don‚Äôt want told you‚Äôre overreacting, don‚Äôt tell others they‚Äôre somehow careless they‚Äôre worried current state. 

The variant circulating weeks case numbers US continue decline. studies come every day confirming protection vaccines providing known variants.

So may take another 15% population vaccinated **you** feel comfortable, many others ok it‚Äôs going vaccines administered every day.

I‚Äôm confident US path reducing COVID point it‚Äôs presence small enough longer problem dominates lives changes way live.

Again, maybe think we‚Äôll path vaccinations. That‚Äôs fine opinion. quit telling feeling thinking wrong. point it‚Äôs subjective. So, yeah, able get vaccinated. several months articles glorifying masks tearing anyone, expert otherwise, dared suggest weren‚Äôt effective, vaccines always scrutinized media. I‚Äôm surprised many think masks good better. got Moderna shot side effects second dose large welt arm injection site (didn't even hurt much) bad chills middle night (which space heater took care of) day got shot. I'm chronically ill thought would hit especially hard side effects, really nothing.

This like reading Amazon reviews. much likely leave review *not* happy something are. people bad side effects ones talk it. people mild nonexistent side effects see reason say anything because, well, nothing really happened talk about? Yep, fact variants infectious possibly even deadly even relevant. Let's forget it. here. get tested coming back country fully vaccinated  Nice. .9%. [California sort thing inevitable. people choice involves great deal complexity science, rather accept either option OK, obsess rumors tiny differences. depends marginal difficulty administering vaccine people.

The first n% world easiest they'll live developed, wealthy countries resources administrative capability manage distribution. starts get difficult. want charge distributing vaccines active war zone like Syria, example. Google It, plan reactivate economy. like Alaska   pretty natural want worrisome news come play feeling good things. people acting good faith here; *want* bad news.

But really bad news, something need keep eye on. I'm sure health departments stockpiling doses able vaccinations another surge among unvaccinated.

The news UK we've seen good: B.1.617.2 cases definitely doubling weekly, they've given total doses US. appears one dose good it. top lot doses AZ, dramatically less effective mild disease begin with. match Israel's 65% vaccinated better vaccines (as appear be) fine.

So far every country that's though ""beat"" pandemic proven wrong within months. strongly looks like case (for second time) UK. point rule broken obviously, need remain focused convincing people get vaccinated celebrate prematurely.  don‚Äôt know they‚Äôll dealing terms clientele may bring (i.e. infamous respiratory infection), suppose. It‚Äôs natural. would think less nervous coworkers a.ready level trust established.  worry media get control cases rise even slightest governmental panic everyone going wear mask everything going shut damn reason. Even tell life vaccines though. Like chickenpox parties told old get HPV vaccine (though I‚Äôve heard age expanded now). guess also want live young. effective way achieve people getting vaccinated. Maine substantially bigger MA... 

That said geographic size really matter much here. state like NV huge also ~75% state lives single county. 80% move two counties. Illinois similar spot, whole Chicago area rather specific county. 

California huge too, far behind states. flip side, TN, KY, SC, around size Maine.

Size ‚Äî geographic population ‚Äî New England specifically well vaccinations. region demographically least predisposed anti-vax sentiments generally well run wealthier, making process likely administered well. went last night wings indoors local place Florida.

They new TouchTunes juke box playing country music.

I paid $3 play WAP employees came running unplug it.

Best re-intro indoor dining ever.  me. Usually I've gym alot go office Can't soldiers ordered get vaccinations? vaccinator group Facebook. definitely way reports serious side effects Moderna.  Nice.   Correct, complete. high enough work preventing spread COVID-19. done part. mask shit public health. vaccine everything mask does, better. Wearing mask also really annoys wearing long, thats secondary. 

I wear mask fully vaccinated unless store policy (which getting less less common) literally law. simple. rest Virginia ruining Northern Virginia... weird comment. Imagine someone fulfilling request provide information think one case ""what-aboutism"" strong enough disprove everything else brought up, claiming falling propaganda. Wild A+ reading comprehension.  4% adult population US considered immunocompromised, many vaccine partially completely ineffective Luckily I'm from, anyone 13 years old consent vaccination require approval parents. anti-vaxxer parents losing minds nothing stop it. Let grab binoculars take look prefer getting higher dose one shitty day vs lower dose, probably difference reality.

Got Pfizer, many shitty days lol fml second shot, kept reminding much worse actual disease would be, weeks months.  immediately felt happier took Tylenol Slacked sick. think forgetting dense US spread Canada is. US also got vaccines much sooner Canada. densitiy States access vaccine, US far ahead Canada.

The population irrelevant, percentage people getting vaccine relevant. Huh? apply Japan's deaths per million US population, US would ~32,000 covid deaths, would normal flu season. Japan's country (I believe) great without controlling virus find is, higher elderly population US too. Hopefully somebody releases tool swap bixby implanted chip google assistant. genuinely baffles actual parents don‚Äôt vaccinate children least required shots. It‚Äôs also scary people think ph.D Human Biology reading articles written ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù Thirty Fourth page Google Peoples way fat is. Celery sticks mile run gluttons Shocker here. Best ignore move on. Pretty much rule anytime talks.  1.	The cluster originated foreign traveler (India variant)
2.	19 28 airport workers vaccinated, 9 weren‚Äôt likely ones spread it.
3.	None cases resulted serious illness death.

It‚Äôs known vaccinated people carry virus (and test positive) amount virus small doesn‚Äôt result even symptoms lot time. small viral load also spread vaccinated individuals unlikely. 

I keep seeing Singapore airport along New York Yankees breakthrough cases stories brought stir alarm. again, examples show carrying virus possible, don‚Äôt get sick don‚Äôt spread really matter??

Finally, don‚Äôt get people put much attention kinds isolated stories (which again, show vaccines work) seem ignore fact population whole amazing right vaccines.

Think it, amount people vaccinated, chance catching becoming seriously ill COVID even .1%, would 1,290 cases severe COVID among vaccinated there. 

I haven‚Äôt even heard one, know media would jump it. 

The fact crazy efficacy vaccines clinical trials shown happen real world. 95% hospitalization (remember that‚Äôs 95% less hospitalization control group, doesn‚Äôt mean 5% chance hospitalized) 100% death. 

Making big deal vaccinated people Singapore Yankees tested positive misleading goes discourage people fence getting shot. Summer even start June 20

Technically, sure. Culturally, summer starts next weekend ends labor day weekend post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Thanks. article says ‚Äúcould‚Äù ‚Äúmight‚Äù thrown out. Without data evidence, speculation makes fear reason. Good, I'm giving booster shots I'm sure lot burned health care personnel feel same. Moderna gives something like 92% efficacy first dose, Moderna also testing single dose efficacy latest clinical trials.

Wow looked this. could something Canada make us wait 4 months doses. yeah option choose limited shipments Moderna. matter. Pretty good. Masks 2035, safe? Maybe 2040 *even safer*? fighting losing battle. Many people think they're vaccinated, pandemic over, time hit bars drink. Idk whats chiropractors, every often one comes page tiktok, never wearing mask(this CDC changed guidance), even client wearing mask. strange. Good point, seems plausible. case, though, would expect young people worse symptoms. Really way know without data. Hope nobody ever thinks bringing back restrictions winter suggests kind mandatory rules flu seasons pretty decent side effects Pfizer, possibly including month long period, something never happened before.

Like what?? kind weird feeling know tens millions people every day gaining immunity hellish virus. least they're lawn, right? Eh also substantially younger populace Europe, definitely explains part it. primarily due fact school districts spend **way** much money overhead *administrative* expenses, they're given enough funding. don‚Äôt access whole study doesn‚Äôt look like says it‚Äôs causing accelerated aging? looking whether anti-aging drugs might help reduce severity covid infection. Sounds like glorified masseuse though literally side effects pfizer 2nd lol  sir stare phones. Im staring one type this. Yup. Moved Denmark, medical system fully cross-integrated. one system, one ID number, pick medication (prescriptions stored magstripe insurance card automatically), book doctors visit, book COVID vaccine, look medical records (literally them), more.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I‚Äôm thankful parents, 80, part first wave get vaccine. relieved immunized shed tears mandatory observation period.

No joke, virus dangerous elderly. fence, It. Don‚Äôt bet odds survive virus. Bet vaccine. may reverse. Since vaccine side effects produced immune system working, could severe people would mild COVID. I'd looking avoid superspreader quarantine hotel.

Same here. absurd. hotels supposed keep people safe, clearly they're opposite that. Exactly! don‚Äôt feel right That‚Äôs kind like lottery though. won‚Äôt even know real vaccine trial over. Good you. T45 ers worried end variant holidays evades vaccine throws us back lockdown. Yeah suppose could survey people actually tested positive covid, seen bad symptoms asymptomatic, see vaccine response was.

I‚Äôm thinking never got covid extremely strong immune response virus, might lucky virus might done lot worse you, seems lot symptoms immune system responding virus. Good them. Meanwhile teenagers stare phones. totally ignoring part NEVER happen. fantasy think otherwise. real world trust science vaccine received going protect (and around you). People taking pride ridiculously anxious germaphobes. It‚Äôs weird fuck agree keeping discussion thread anti semetic? living lala land That‚Äôs I‚Äôm going with. they're using cow dung ""cure"" something?

Not making guess mask would still help cough start talking. that, yeah don‚Äôt really get it. Yes. personal experience, son going school since Nov. Masks, distancing, new HVAC systems. notification emails 2 cases, neither infected school, neither consisted spread. extremely unlikely vaccinated person able transmit virus. may make sense chain, there'll always niche areas will. One coworkers used occasionally go Shakey's (pizza mojo potates). AYCE Korean BBQ pretty good. mean carry virus? don‚Äôt think chance that. Super anecdotal nurse I‚Äôve seen patients died bunch family members died too. Every one think entire family morbidly obese There's evidence indicate significant vaccine breakthrough developed virus really we'd need monitor global cases issue travel bans quarantines accordingly.  No, according logic, check vaccination status.

I'm saying, following science. science says masks vaccinated, masks everyone. think apparent CFR higher. Testing short supply lot milder infections never counted. everyone go gather temple mount, eh? Well know people side effects first shot come contact virus shot. immune response. TIL, also feel like heard lot American sources I'm totally ignorant means, little weird us. responsible leaders. lot European countries call jab rather shot. Got first shot right arm, second arm? Side effects don‚Äôt tend show next day. side-effects come knocking door several days jab. also understand means protect country instead running mouth it.  There's also supposed link COVID blood type (iirc, type assumed susceptible/easier COVID glom onto), seen studies done since middle last year. I'd love see get investigated point.

Most KND operatives successfully avoid this, adults go offensive needle based weaponry trying inoculate every kid.

oh! soon!? 


im soon!!!  first moderna shot you, sore arm like get flu shot. second shot feeling like crap day after, muscle aches slight fever. took Tylenol fine still stuff day felt like crap. zero effective political leadership. US subverted democracy postwar period put LDP power, who, without real opposition ~70 years, become corrupt incompetent imagine. absolutely brilliant, competent people levels medical system public health infrastructure, little say government responds pandemic. still using socialized healthcare sytem... paying it

So going socialist healthcare country somehow offers better hernia repair US

No Rand Paul happy get treatment socalized healthcare system private healthcare system.

[Congress members public (or, call it, ""socialist"") healthcare anyway sorts wrong here. trying make weird political point? say want say lol Sure. I'll continue - I'll little cognizant spend them. enjoy eating out, probably need five nights week. 5 million 12-18 gotten vaccinated afraid call lie. It‚Äôs always something huh. oh 100 people highly vaccinated society ever metal actually is? actually *seen* slaughtering process? even happens long lifetime? far brutal anything vocabulary could describe. Massages do. ""adjustments"" don't, made up. zero science  Chiropractic worthless. massage claim - relaxes helps painful muscles. zero scientific evidence Chiropractic working called selfish helpful international vaccine distribution There's thing.  Corona virus da!!!! Wryyyyyyyyyyyyy  correct. still using socialized healthcare sytem... paying it. Republicans say US best healthcare world... turns hernias; socialist healthcare country somehow offers better hernia repair US, Rand Paul happy get treatment socalized healthcare system private healthcare system. 

So makes 100% sense. No. scientific evidence benefit woo can't achieved form massage. medical treatment. Um. much they've bungled far... us wash groceries, going nuts surfaces mostly aerosols, masks time masks.... 

I think they're trying best, know long covid effects happen asymptomatic cases test know less community spread, correct? every infection opportunity mutation? Trump said 'dont test,' rightfully chastised. warned vaccine magic bullet.

This consistent seems less defeating covid jumpstarting economy.    lot times offer massage therapy well. also medical uses, pain relief physical therapy. So, sort of. They're similar. mean either useless.

For personally, massage (and lesser degree chiropractic adjustment) help manage migraines.

Of course, obviously, practitioners sell lie accomplish. Rand Paul also socialized medicine, needed hernia fixed flew canada taken care of.

This makes sense several levels. Canada pay visitors' healthcare, obviously.  still wear mask winter indoor crowded places. It‚Äôs first winter haven‚Äôt cold sinus infection forever, winter terrible time year airborne pathogens dry, heated air. 

I don‚Äôt care thinks me, prefer share germs get sick. never see adults coughing hand touching dozens surfaces, won‚Äôt soon.  Also requirement keep pfizer ultra low temperatures. want someone mishandle batch included vaccine find actually protected He's already immune know in-joke.

It's much inaccurate, experience, vegans like use descriptive way talking factory farming, much I've noticed bit joke vegans make eating animals sound metal actually is. UK ordered. still millions waiting vaccines. Every jab becomes available used. spares end moved countries.   Yeah...

(News Focus) Touted exemplary pandemic response, S. Korea spotlight global vaccine hub place wild. No, 15 cases lot lol.

The aim avoid cases covid costs. always cases. try avoid cases never leave house.

 that's want that's everyone else doing. child abuse? People US super even remote idea sort new national identification system, even it‚Äôs standard card stating whether you‚Äôre vaccinated. Need treatments. I'm gonna need see twice week instead week!  strange me. grew Quebec medical age consent 14. special considerations teenagers 14-18 undergoing major procedures hospitalized. basic healthcare even get full privacy protections parents. 14, could gone doctor gotten necessary vaccinations without parents' knowledge. disease want parents know about, could see doctor get prescription without reference parents. parents pro modern medicine anything embarassing going come much. enjoy freedom flexibility bother permission slips able go doctor alone.

Obviously lot easier place universal healthcare. presented medicare card (or number expiry date) government paid clinic. parents' job ability pay totally irrelevant. always surprises laws seem treat 17yo babies. older teenager may lack life experience, maturity judgment make decisions, significant abilities agency law respect that. old enough criminally charged, old enough choose get vaccine antibiotics UTI whatever. Given Covishield branding Indian manufacturing Oxford vaccine, since India stopped exports, going another type vaccine (Oxford vaccine produced elsewhere, another type entirely) seems wise, otherwise guaranteed wait. would suggest varies person. day half second jab bed fever ache. Lasted another day. Site tenderness 4 5 days.  Agreed, good idea.

Asking young people wait vaccine elderly medical need get vaccinated reasonable. Asking young people sit indoors nothing 70 year olds jet Portugal holiday terrible idea invitation people start really disliking system vaccination.   Agreed. Many DOs attended programs cheaper, convenient, easier get into, etc. 

My Dermatologist great. doesn‚Äôt quacky BS chiropractors do. Polio, also. 15 people nothing context multiple events 60,000 people nurse said 16 weeks like whut üôÅ mean Google it. Lots places get it. 

The jab 95% 5% get it. Pass on. facts. Check data websites. still deal false positives. Imagine screening 20000 people basketball arena. 3% false positives, thats 600 people. Furthermore imagine false positives 3 worried family members complaining. Thats 2400 people total. 

Of course done, also lead lot trouble. Soup Plantation! Sweet Tomatoes! Bring back! 

It buffet chain US closed due covid Care share example Still, seemed strange tell wait 13 weeks register. register right away ready 13 week mark. Instead, listen her. may ready week 10 waiting register. Even timeline chart shows indoor dining open late summer/early fall, really whole year, it? 

As someone lives Toronto, would choose dine inside even open moment.  really seem necessary though. need everyone vaccinated, enough people vaccinated (in combination restrictions) R less 1. spread happening, there's need exclude unvaccinated.

This particularly relevant allowing unvaccinated people would extremely unfair younger people people can't vaccinated medical reasons. also really needed incentive vaccination, uptake offered vaccine incredibly high.

People talking vaccine certification UK ages, agree it. It'd hugely complex flawed system would extremely limited benefits. Spread UK already rock bottom vaccination programme going well. Implementing system like would used month go window make sense.  issues much easier mitigate compared pandemic. Lol Interesting play deny vaccinating Palestinians Occupation. reddit, everyone hates America here. vaccinated gives significant protection catching (something like 60-70% least). recent studies suggest people *do* still catch it, half likely pass someone caught without vaccine. 

So combine that, something like 80-85% decreased chance somebody vaccine catching covid passing on, compared unvaccinated person. 

With R0 3 COVID, need population-wide 67% reduction chance catching spreading infection stop growth outbreak. would achieved 80-85% vaccination rate, numbers.

That achievable threshold. Eapecially consider existing population immunity previous infection.

UK, instance, 95% vaccine uptake (first dose) older age groups eligible while, likely track 90% uptake younger groups. US 85% age 65+ (first dose). Yes ?. Really? strictly true: states permit minors consent medical procedures appear mature capable informed consent. Alabama legally consent medical procedures, without parents involved. Spread word! gonna like awhile. States clearing backlogs people using say American pandemic still going strong, really be. drive West Virginia? mature minor doctrine legally consent medical procedures without parental involvement. mean US, point main thing standing normality refuse take vaccine. would much sympathy either.

OTOH r/CoronavirusUK quite domestic vaccine passports, that's least partly almost everyone wants take vaccine, 30s offered yet. Whether changes month two interesting see, I've seen many argue everyone offered it, there'll need passports we'll herd immunity. took daughter 15 social anxiety answered every question her. also look like 15 year old daughter almost always get shocked weird expressions say she‚Äôs mine. didn‚Äôt ask proof anything either us. one friend who‚Äôs parents anti specific vaccine we‚Äôre debating taking goes second dose. Paywall well cannot read actual article, but:

Taiwan's TSMC world-leading producing semiconductors, terms technological edge market share. real competitor Samsung currently, although EU USA looking invest domestic production (though take time). TSMC production island.

These semiconductors vital part pretty much electronics: computers, phones, consoles, cars - name it. pandemic however lead world-wide shortage semiconductors. reasons many, include increased demand due WFH economic turmoil leading cancelled re-added orders car manufacturers (creating huge backlogs). TSMC also facing problems like droughts. New factories built take years complete.

But covid? Well, Taiwan done well whole pandemic able keep virus borders. recently surge cases, vaccines scarcity outside US, UK, EU, Canada countries. creates fears addition deaths problems local population, might hit semicondictor production hard already huge shortage. really special, right top players, touching distance even, player nervous/ excited, feel them. every single one friends wants jab. allowed yet. UK like US; can't get jab wanting it. jabs still super age-restricted Public Health England administering J&amp;J include research. said OP something similar bear mind research Public Health England. England, we're administering J&amp;J, vaccine included research.  Bear mind Public Health England conducted research. 

In England, Pfizer AstraZeneca vaccines common vaccines administered. administering Moderna, rare. volunteered several times vaccine sites none administering Moderna. since public AZ Pfizer, makes sense encourage public. 

There's doubt Moderna safe worry :) 60% (for 2 doses AstraZeneca) considered effective ""highly"" effective? covid cases definitely starting tick back UK again. What's going on? China covid free strict immigration lockdowns vaccines even existed, vaccines utter tool. minority administered AZ Seychelles, 42%. Bahrain UAE issues. Correct, mostly crickets. month now, expected results would come following week.  
Lat week (and potentially already that), sufficient Covid cases participants draw conclusions, analyzing data.

(I know i'm participant periodic check-up, doctor stud told me) chances variant mutating much it‚Äôs able strangely vaccine resistant still functioning, disease causing, easily spread virus small.

Source? What‚Äôs moderna? could kinda get peoples scepticism AZ. Isn‚Äôt almost identical Pfizer one? Exactly. Doesn‚Äôt help everyone like big deal child got school last year brought home gave everyone else home. Yes definitely worse adults scary knowing cause kids damage sometime road. What's policy undocumented immigrants ID? want get vaccinated. they? that‚Äôs fucking weird. anyone would give shit random people might possibly think maybe republican pathetic shit Ummm ok rest us got j&amp;j one? üò≥ making rounds last year dubai planning use airports etc I'm thinking getting get numbers up. Vaccine free, side effects. 

A week hospital several thousand dollars, good insurance. Or, tens thousands without insurance.  lots patients long-term effects. would ask old are, probably can‚Äôt even remember anyway. UK making line age specific. proposal would effectively lock 20 something's (and teenagers) events fault own.

Negative lateral flow fine, need punish young people suffered enough protect elderly. brother got covid get vaccinated.. he's 38. usually means already infection. Same! whew, looks like potato chip supply safe now. Apparently, men receding hairline higher risk too. points genetic predisposition. screening test, false positive rate hardly matters. sensitivity number matters. dog might able screen thousands people quickly identify need testing. old article?  Computer chips, hit drought (which need photolithography masks, cooling photolitography machines washing silicon wafers), suffering spike COVID cases forcing TSMC (taiwan Semiconductor manufacturing corp) go 50-50 work arrangement affects productivity. clear big impact already bad semi-conductor shortage: TSMC manufactures chips Apple ( iphones/ipads/macbook air), AMD (so AMD CPU/GPU/PS5/Xbox series x), huawei, degree Qualcomm ('although shifted highest end chip Samsung Foundries instead) many others ‚ÄúWe together‚Äù theory whole thing earth ecosystem trying  damage control us humans caused centuries, via build kill switch covid actived infected host who's knows.  pay wall looked. semiconductors. need read article know that, there's shortage months. people doing...?

They're probably criticizing countries currently worst Covid cases, would assume India current moment anyone know good resource Johnson Johnson emerging variants? dad vaccine thinking adding another one fall. J&amp;J seems get mentioned lot well. gonna assume it‚Äôs good too.  Czech Republic (EU) here. vaccination rate currently around 33 %, Pfizers recently become available large enough numbers.

Our epidemic numbers plummet well, faster expected. Probably combination really brutal winter wave (30 thousand dead nation 10 million, one worst outcomes world) left lot people natural antibodies, improving weather. would require Novavax actually applying approval vaccine, something holding everywhere. UK production started Feb expected apply approval July... even possible since still catch/spread even vaccinated  literally putting chunks dead animal body parts muscle tendon fat skin marrow mouth eating it. Sometimes, parts multiple animals ground together. call ‚Äúbeef‚Äù ‚Äúpork‚Äù ‚Äúbacon‚Äù whatever, it‚Äôs body parts slaughtered animal

Why guys always say don‚Äôt know we‚Äôre eating lol Good thing need one theory year ago friend pointed said Maybe right look trials, majority side effects besides sore arm, change outcome/overall effectiveness. always get antibody titer check ease mind. here. First shot tiny bruise. Second shot even mark. Never even got nap. feel gyped. Provinces make budgets, chose money goes doesn‚Äôt go. Quacks quacking. I'll believe see it. He's dragging country toilet showing signs stopping.  explained comment. additional step could go wrong, albeit unlikely. 2nd shot fucks you. least like friends. Lasts 12 hours. read statement wrong. realize taking minor. wrote they're verifying things. relating experience. ""Weirdly"" Nah pretty obvious tbh profit healthcare system, thousands different competing chains siloed systems, essentially means national system tracking vaccinations anywhere beyond state level. Eh strange considering information breakthrough cases. I‚Äôd really interested know antibodies something funky going immune system. 

Did get JNJ, Pfizer Moderna? suppose JNJ case likely, protective moderate severe disease sounds like you‚Äôre much verge severe. But......summer vacation  Same. hoping Pfizer. got call doses headed trash arms able get Moderna age group included. Took nurses dozen donuts thank you. Everyone works vax sites want give many possible. They're gonna fight want shot. Considering last week preliminary testing, many infected working zone airport received flights high-risk countries, including South Asia. Several tested positive B.1.617 variant first detected India, World Health Organization said might contagious versions coronavirus.e Friday. health officials said 28 airport workers became infected, 19 fully vaccinated either Pfizer Moderna vaccines, two approved use Singapore. airport outbreak began 88-year-old member airport cleaning crew fully vaccinated tested positive virus May 5. Co-workers became infected later visited airport food court, transmitted virus customers, officials said.

I agree. feels like CDC complete full ""whatever happens happens"" mode. That's risk variants. answer yes, help allergies. pay $800 year health insurance?

Yup

Canadians fume   including t45 loving sister ( score!)

Congrats one! many former current supporters even aware got vaccination. Utterly bizarre. thinking same. idk everyone‚Äôs acting like it‚Äôs anomaly. childhood friend lost mom (mid 70s) brother (50) within couple weeks. Family (like 15 people) got sick time. Two passed. agree...something seems genetic predisposition. thoughts parents almost 12 year olds try sneak one person administering shot? parent come give ‚Äúhe‚Äôll 12 couple months - still it?‚Äù routine? Great way get punched face workplace weekly screening saliva tests continue foreseeable future. us vaccinated nice extra reassurance. What? Ha! got J&amp;J vaccine, mid April right paused. Two weeks ago, started symptoms bad cold. prob, thought, I‚Äôm vaccinated. Three days ago, totally lost sense smell (gone) taste (mostly)
Hmmm.... far tell looking various studies, J &amp; J basically effectiveness single dose Pfizer Astra Zeneca. good protection, good getting two doses. 

It makes sense. dont see anything special J &amp; J would make effective others single dose. Technically similar Astra Zeneca, really. basically getting protection first dose vaccine, never getting second dose.

Good want check ""vaccinated"" list get 'vaccine passport quickly. Less good want beat protection.  That‚Äôs brilliant also really sad time hard say dont know specifically caused current pandemic. China let scientists come gain access early data Wuhan barriers maybe could learn something help prevent happening again. know wont happen though. pay $800 year health insurance?

The plan offered wife's employer (school district) costs $28,000 year cover three us, including deductibles co-payments.

We using it. also less transmissible far deadly. easier isolate infected. urgency contact tracing, even beginning. one noticed covid 19 thousands deadly, comparatively. here. live Canada like choose Pfizer Moderna like guys US. 

But yeah got Pfizer would fine either way.  biggest motivator getting vaccinated others would stop giving it? number educated guess best. one really knows. Either way, vast majority protection comes 1st dose, it‚Äôs safe say 70% adult population getting first dose major milestone.  Lives lost virus point ""acceptable"" level. That's felt like, imagined. telling wife imagine feeling respiratory issues top it. Would **absolute** nightmare. Barely countries even one, several planning introducing one large events. Nobody climbing Everest days gives shit. real eco type mountaineers climbing shit Alaska Andes. someone who‚Äôs acted cautiously course pandemic, understand say ‚Äúthe vaccines might work variants‚Äù may believe genuine concern. there‚Äôs little evidence variant escaped, *whole lot* supporting high efficacy slate vaccines we‚Äôve got.

Yes, situation change, line thinking self-fulfilling prophecy. It‚Äôs people throw hands say, ‚Äúif doesn‚Äôt work, won‚Äôt get it,‚Äù give virus better chance mutate.

So, please. Unless happens, *enough* gloom. Let‚Äôs convince doubters vaccines work get us back lives. low ever.

Last June, testing still difficult get places. cities, doctors still telling sick patients assume self-isolate conditions worsened. conducting 600,000 tests daily positivity rate 5 percent. Today, conducting 1 million tests per day positivity rate 3 percent.

That time terrifying. Ah one point, getting 30k positive cases per day seeing 2k people die per day. Masks short supply. networks talking studies COVID could spread 20 feet away. China suggested traced covid case back empty elevator previously positive patient in. Virginia 65 hopefully hit 70 within week two. rollout poor start excellent since believe there's certain threshold cases considered positive. Anyway, asymptomatic cases still able transmit virus. Singapore, family members close contacts fully vaccinated cases mild symptoms. think people selfish stupid pushed end line receiving vaccine. probably details cared but:

no immune system issues, health concerns general.

not weight. i‚Äôm quite thin nothing crazy. exercise

i‚Äôve 103 degree fever. run high temps i‚Äôm sick i‚Äôm def rushing hospital, good lord feel it. go sweating profusely shivering blood loss toes (i raynauds syndrome, nothing health wise cause discomfort). it‚Äôs longest i‚Äôve ever sick think that‚Äôs worst part, hate sick. haven‚Äôt slept 1-2 hours time 6 days nose gets drippy throat gets dry wakes up. i‚Äôve sore throat swollen, tender lymph nodes hurts swallow. sinus infection prolonged congestion...my teeth hurt bad (maxillary sinus). body gets painful it‚Äôs time take ibuprofen. aches get random, momentarily acute pains over. def fever thing me. don‚Äôt shortness breath, know everyone gets, covid staple it‚Äôs strange i‚Äôm quite sick without it.

the thing comparable got flu years ago. 104 degree fever, pretty exceptional. lasted couple days though.

i‚Äôm heavy drinker, i‚Äôm also drinking rn bc medicine

i‚Äôm 22F Moderna nearly identical Pfizer. primarily used USA. Pfizer vaccine part German, Pfizer huge company compared Moderna.

It's awesome vaccine. worry.

Moderna easier store comes pre-diluted, Pfizer mixed together vaccinator, ways Moderna protective medical error. Take first available. antivaccine people always loudest opinions ‚Äúoptimism‚Äù gave people false hope instead readying crisis. 

Yeah really is. Even bad younger age demographic flu guess 600k dead Americans vs 40k-60k annual flu deaths meaningless you. mention people long term side effects knows side effects may pop years come given *novel* (aka new) virus. similar immune response, perhaps, without virus damage body. Vaccine shopping almost identical efficacy rate alarmingly ignorant self-centered, period. fact masks made political symbol honestly depressing.

Masks turned political symbol 15 months ago yeah sad. Yep. breakthrough, might get cold. shut society cold. shut prevent mass death. Oh agree you, objection socialized healthcare ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want pay people‚Äôs choices‚Äù wonder think paying choices current system. answer: everyone, premiums (commercial) taxes (CMS) rather taxes. go get vaccinated, won‚Äôt worry. theory undiagnosed autoimmune conditions. masks, Japan country type numbers. know work. second Moderna month ago exhausted 2/3 days. First day felt like hangover (no energy, weak body, groggy) that, felt good. Moderna Samsung ... wonder pop businesses seem exist testing travel. There's one near think solely exists covid testing place, rented spaces everything

I bet money great lasted (charged $40 per test pocket cost pharmacy gave faster results time) bet states longer need testing travel testing free fast large pharmacies people vaccinated feeling less need get tested, places around long.

I need test go canada next month I'm going use pharmacy testing cheaper comes back fast days  US government couldn‚Äôt cover something like that. way press media work here. second CNN got even whisper new unknown virus circulating US they‚Äôd story like flies shit. Besides multiple laws place disclosure public health information unless government set information ‚Äúclassified‚Äù couldn‚Äôt keep themselves. Nice Wow almost mini COVID? seems really fucking stupid. idea viral load impact long covid effects. variant pops use spike protein might know we're testing. make numbers artificially go even still community spread. seems really really stupid. scientist wants information makes definitive statement? I'm positively shocked. new favorite thing see people going places masks optional still wear mask, nose. don‚Äôt get it! like East Asian countries plan that's ready executed follow it. Also, willing flexible depending actual scientific behavior virus/bacteria. next pandemic blood-borne disease, COVID 19 protocols probably much help. got Pfizer shot. confirm arm better sore. first shot though got it. Can't speak side effect far. weakness studies have. Point out. scientists doubt them, name them. know approved emergency use like Pfizer Moderna. Months research? get date from? Show source.

I‚Äôve read relevant data sources I‚Äôm really bothered enough go searching source here. know I‚Äôve read you‚Äôre welcome disagree it. Israel UK strict lock downs well?

Not extent China no, virus much widespread within countries well. It‚Äôs comparable situation. I‚Äôm seeing common trend false equivalences, kind like certain government...

 say chinese vaccines better Pfizer Moderna? Clearly best technology far, although long-term effects still unknown.

Not really, seems long term effect strong resistance infection Covid-19, although newer variants show breakthrough compared effectiveness original Wuhan strain. I'm saying article misleading/biased title anything good end pandemic. even less efficient vaccine protects people killed.

Then agree. we‚Äôll also agree obviously propaganda war vaccine diplomacy greater war ideology. One championed west civil liberties freedom cost less security, one autocracy, oppression lack freedom security. guys best vaccine world, yeah everybody gets it. share dogs vaccinated. ""good"" then?

They protect people funded created vaccines? vaccines used around world, takes time. Unfortunately China still allowed significant travel internationally locked internally assuring whole world would get infected, terrible mess. got Moderna. first shot, experienced arm soreness headache/fatigue. Second shot, arm soreness. people avoiding Moderna ridiculous; everyone experiences vaccine differently. suggest guys meet person. 90% certain you‚Äôre one feeling way. You‚Äôre probably vaxxed now, outdoor meeting isn‚Äôt really dangerous regardless Everyone, collectively. That‚Äôs advantage society first place. efforts effective taken group rather individual. People getting overly selfish money always undermines collective good created society. definitely didn‚Äôt. Feeding 50 kids great, that‚Äôs me. tax takes away everyone benefits everyone. totally different thing. gave 75% money, one else it‚Äôs mandatory everyone impact absolutely minimal grand scheme things. It‚Äôs nice say everyone give 75% money would NEVER happen unless it‚Äôs mandatory.

Listen, there‚Äôs arguing people don‚Äôt get socialist mentality. we‚Äôre best agree disagree. ""Our European visitors important us.""

Yeah, that's lie, it. country 14y need parents see doctor, make decisions health keep health information secret unless allow it.

It's case elsewhere? You‚Äôre right. Plenty older people believe disinformation campaign infertility ‚Äî don‚Äôt personally care don‚Äôt want kids, don‚Äôt want cause imaginary issues grandchildren According article, US prioritize raw materials Curevac wins approval EU. Meanwhile saying reverse situation exists higher efficacy almost margin error anyway.

Early data Moderna ahead Pfizer got studies pulled ahead. 95%. proud mundane things era live in. said nagging feeling. Unless provide something go on, sounds like paranoia They're actively trying make people avoid getting vaccine. many people made polarization issue really not. necessary paperwork kiddo there's reason dog unless child gives cause alarm.

I say child also mean teenager. Yeah legal penalty minor lying get shot basically nil compared adult lying get another persons kid shot.  fair, still 2 high risk communities terms covid spread, fairly diverse low income.

Age based worked, attention needed paid areas reduce fallout. starters, complete lack vaccination clinics areas devastating large portion population regular access vehicles. Public transportation also shoddy MA, Baker largely hindering efforts improve years. Mass vaccination sites included number doses set aside ""local"" residents, put southcoast one cities college town, ended meaning suburban residents college benefited set aside. friends one communities pre registration site directed Gillette stadium vaccine- hour away good day, local one. That's also big hindrance people could afford take time work. also put vaccination information originally English Spanish, missing major immigrant communities state. Information getting passed communities word mouth, included lot falsehoods. state also started decreasing testing sites areas lot people even eligible vaccine, likely contributing higher spread. One communities currently suing state. Overall, state careless dealt low income communities likely caused unnecessary pain many vaccination efforts. Sunday, China's foreign ministry noted WHO-led team concluded lab leak extremely unlikely visit February virology institute. ""The U.S. continues hype lab leak theory,"" ministry said response request comment Journal. ""Is actually concerned tracing source trying divert attention?""

I‚Äôm gonna go ‚Äúactually concerned tracing source‚Äù.

And divert attention what?? You‚Äôd think China would group people stop think smart thing say response. wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs paranoia. OP could overheard worker/volunteer make comment something caused red flag, like improper storage. comment maybe lot fluid left bottle OP skeptical received enough dose. OP doesn‚Äôt provide much detail think it‚Äôs little brash say paranoid. I'm pro-vax, bro. parent?  Yes, absolutely. I'm bariatric surgeon frequently sees women obesity PCOS. difficult tell obesity causes/exacerbates PCOS way around. Many symptoms show significant improvement - insulin resistance effects probably important ones regard long-term health issues - bariatric surgery. Nice. Lol lol learned nothing absolutely open wrong far one made cogent argument. insane.  13% country truly anti-vax, much lower would think browsing Reddit Around 21% people either ‚Äúwait see‚Äù mode ‚Äúonly required‚Äù mode, 64% eager get European Union 15% fully vaccinated. about, 'developing world'? 

You ignorant previous commenter. I'm assuming tracing referring contacts attendees, event. Uh... kidding? know crazy inflation get? even saying? mention ever day delayed reopening huge cost society. people reddit understand anything economics? ridiculous. planet guys live on? really need global concerted effort fight this. countries dealing well going risk everyone else world's health, spreads variants pop up, likely variant emerge much worse vaccines effective against. countries could end basically cut rest world countries trying protect themselves. Hopefully happen, risk. Hey, thanks lot :)  Case rates plummeted. quite unlikely exposed COVID, unlikely would infected were, extremely unlikely would severe symptoms. Compound low probabilities you‚Äôll see virtually risk. safe. Deep down, I'm chubby kid inside read title thought talking tortilla chips. LOL Seems like agree everything. Oh man, rails making weird deranged metaphors now. fun, kid. Exactly. need attention make look there‚Äôs always mountain instead molehill I‚Äôve read responses I‚Äôm going respond once. disagree you‚Äôve said, it‚Äôs opinion fine.

Your argument ‚Äúdon‚Äôt question preconceptions‚Äù questioning preconceptions. It‚Äôs wild. Recent studies (released last week) indicate Pfizer Moderna show effective variants. USA won‚Äôt stop anytime soon, plan lessen reliance, even iffy. pretty encouraging then, country anyone get vaccine numbers declining day passing unfortunately Looks like getting flu like numbers now. That's ridiculous. like saying dogs fault eats hamburger leave floor. beat dog put cage put hamburger floor. backwards. Anyone get many lateral flow tests delivered house want. government recommends taking 2 week anyone. quite accurate PCR tests, they're quite good screening asymptomatic people can‚Äôt believe still don‚Äôt understand I‚Äôm saying.   problem firstly would exclude people, intended not. that, undermine people's faith system vaccination (something understandable reasons, health officials keen preserve).

Secondly, adults due offered vaccine end July. system vaccine passports implemented, would place barely month longer became useful. think there's public health benefit implementing unfair system limited time community transmission hospital admissions lowest levels since start pandemic. vaccinating vulnerable people (first dose administration almost complete) general age cohorts (now 50+) decending order. need prioritize way due lack deliveries. mean, obviously.

I'm saying -vaccinated- person, ""just flu"".
I'm pro-vaccine saying, ""looks great, vaccine works""

Apparently lost everyone. Hey ho. Private companies ones consistently making government crooked. solution give private companies even power!

Your absolutely deranged reasoning skills lmao  Governments around world already invested billions developing vaccine also buying vaccine. Investment issue. make rich people could get vaccine first instead people need more.   debate linger years doubt opinions change much, lingering question fear generated early days really warranted. need sort license operate things patients? software

99% *need* open-source alternatives closed-source programs steaming piles shit exorbitantly priced. Literally, one reasons piracy hardware

Computer hardware decreased price became cheaper manufacture companies need computers operate 21st century. That, supplies processors, graphics cards, motherboards, etc. etc. swelled point manufacturers charge thousands dollars basic setup. ""free market"". silicon shortage struck computer components expensive ever consumers find inaccessible solely ""free market"" OK again. FFS

So government crooked government. Fucking ridiculous. can't even imagine messed reasoning skills are.

I mean that's like saying put everyone jail instead locking doors. absurd. problem state insecure apparatus easily corrupted want fight corruption. see insane is? Apparently! allowed get vaccines normal circumstances (from research think mrna ones safe told less sure). 

When child encephalitis told 70% chance returning vaccinated. Encephalitis far bigger risk personally 33 years age Covid. That's medical reason I'm sure people similar concerns.

It's unclear vaccine offered me. worry J&amp;J astrazenica made ""traditional vaccines"" warned against. Mrna ones (pzifer moderna) okay think, I'm hoping I'll offered one need awkward conversations get choice vaccine offered us here... Singapore‚Äôs ability trace understand case example world. thing is, *can* force get vaccine (see: Gulf War 1 + anthrax vaccines). haven‚Äôt decided yet (a mistake, opinion).  I‚Äôm sure mean asymptomatic. mean someone COVID yet? Because... yeah, should, that‚Äôs whole point. mean someone already COVID? Still, yes, should. 

The vaccine *greatly* reduces chances carrying transmitting virus. Good stuff, numbers slightly higher CDC?

For instance, adults given one dose, according table, 61.8%. CDC says explain difference coming from? rambling like complete lunatic lmao ""All Americans bad"" moronic. you, five? Good. Glad agree cost benefit analysis instead relying ""if saved even one life"" logic. Nobody gets retrieved Everest. Bodies become landmarks. brain desd Poor Novavax relegated paragraph bottom. OK... people need pay things want? Wow shocking. use outliers proof anything. goal better perfect. Building burn socialized firefighters know. Private systems better equipped less waste save property. net gain positive. ridiculous ""gotcha"" argument. mean pay insurance get money anyways? change oil car someone come house change behind back. ridiculous. There's way contain it, imo. Japanese government proven completely ineffectual. luck Japan past year rests squarely citizens. allowing kids? former Montrealer, they're wrong. believe, short term, plan though... allow events happen, make sure everyone negative test result entering. communicate well all. getting bit silly point -- apparently 33-34 get now. would imagine someone age probably similar chances (age 21) dying COVID, yet I'll probably wait months longer them. 

I read someone suggesting stopped age-based approach 50+ vaccinated (or arbitrary divider 'older people') vaccinated based exposure -- prioritising teachers, shop workers, etc use NPR vaccine tracker, lots useful graphs info state. FFS no. Thats I'm saying all. argument isn‚Äôt exclude, require additional precautions unvaccinated forever; either virus longer circulating vaccination milestones hit. marathon continues see still hold Olympics numbers like these. presented overwhelming evidence contrary, put fingers ears shout: 'LA LA LA LA""...and double down. 

It's unfortunate messaging get traction folks. Oh, gosh, I'm sorry saying ""lucky"" obvious medically necessary. know probably hurt remark, wrongly assumed one kids definitely needed soon possible. That‚Äôs cost benefit analysis personal posting. ‚ÄúWe‚Äù make decisions saves thousands lives. Oh no, got it. think vaccine rates starting overcome virus numbers revise history pretend like ‚Äújust flu‚Äù true along.

If 13% country anti-vaccination/vaccine hesitant, struggling reach 70% adults July 4th (we make unfortunately, unless something changes dramatically). 

75% likely non-mandated/non-heavily incented ($1000+ payments) cap adults - assuming reach vaccine apathetic via aggressive access outreach. quarter population refusing safe effective pharmaceutical intervention disappointing. 

As comparison point, UK already vaccinated 57% entire population - appointments 30-31 year olds. easily sail past 85% adults 90% impossible (will depend uptake 18-30s).

Do honestly believe CDC doctors never thought scenario did? That's expected rollout tiered older people prioritised due increased risk ways, certainly, lack experience older generations. often ahead technological curve. Can‚Äôt punish us vaccinated people refusing forever. Time let us live lives. difficult say worst

Sure, really competition. People tired angry absolutely justified. trying tell guy wrong feelings, get it. consider youngish, i'm bloody pissed lost much time thankful we're better died covid medical problems lack medical care pandemic.

This feel personal situation, understand easier reach conclusion someone sacrificed 'no-one'. son every day reminding i'm still frustrated time gone.

As angry makes times, constant reminder person for.

No-one asked one way another made sacrifices fellow man, age entitlement deciding factor whether appropriate not. got put shit situation give something, thats true right childhood elder years. people worse either dead, still suffering effects made choices did. credible forecaster ever predicting 5-10 million deaths US. earliest reports Wuhan indicated infection fatality rate 0.5% so, US population 330 million herd immunity rate 75% would mean something neighborhood 1.5 million deaths, give take, even never developed vaccine. Perhaps individual vaccinated person considered like flu. case, relate story? vaccine works shit-show nearly over. Let's get head around that.

Given context posted, seems like opposed kind trial described article. So, want let everyone start mixing events like maximum capacity without kind controlled process study designed ensure there's nothing we've overlooked? it?

More armchair epidemiology, great. Vaccinated 80s are, unless recent findings changing (I'm happy shown otherwise), still much risk severely affected covid unvaccinated 30s.

Is correct? thought chances getting seriously ill vaccinated catch covid tiny, like 0.0x%? CVS lawyers. can't see guys saying thing? (less privatization thing bad gets).

I agree whatever said cyril0 kinda agree others said too.

helthcare must work people, people ones blame: allow bad healthcare exist. stupid? maybe mainly vote wrong politicians con-artist (yeah..it happened) saying it‚Äôs unbelievable burden teachers administrators? completely remote teachers forced juggle person online learning students thriving remote learning, someone linked thread. 

Best move available want it. 3x vaccine substance. basically works yes. vast majority get minor side effects like headache, maybe fever. Severe side effects exceedingly rare, there's basically way predict them. time someone says ""you get vaccine X"", they're usually wrong. 

There longer trial periods, people paying attention. one cared Prevnar 13, latest pneumonia vaccine, hundreds thousands people die year pneumonia, already shot market, Pneumovax 23. actually takes longer trials gather data incidents rates low. covid shots got data 2 months vaccines wait years for. came across time limits one thought would issue (say, 1 year safety data), got approved Early Use, submitting FDA approval  Yeah, data shows Florida average vaccinations.

Looks like Florida has:

* Given one dose: 47.6 %
* Fully vaccinated: 37.4 %
* Daily rate doses administered: 115,828
* Supply used: 78.1% 3x substance going issue. talking ng/mL scale there. Now, 3x product, might something. 13k coronavirus cases entire country yesterday! Ohio alone reporting nearly many cases daily last winter. Get vaccinated, vaccines safe, effective fastest way pandemic. Ah sounds unfortunate. Might worth reminding again, 3 months far results continued great, really easy young people bothered (I one). Maybe convince would easier get wife follow suit? 

At start pandemic heard plenty people assumed Covid forget plenty things could cause similar symptoms. hindsight there's way could time. everyone older rich boomer type, know.

My parents, 70s, bought first home peanuts done well increases prices. time they've pretty terrified long (mum works opticians p/t) still take lots precautions dad's immunocompromised. 

It's difficult say worst; old much easier recently assets almost housebound old, young able live normal lives everyone's vaccinated. Maybe thankful we're better died covid medical problems lack medical care pandemic. true, though I've heard almost completely locked bases overseas.  imagine scientist reading thread lol. many ""logical conclusions"" hold real scientific water. end day based data we've seen, mRNA vaccines equally effective. data show Pfizer slightly less side effects, that's all.

IIRC Moderna's experimental boosters lower payload OG shot. fuck, first i'm hearing it. drought taiwan, country tropical/sub-tropical climate monsoon seasons, seriously alarming. feels like bigger story ship shortage me, unless happens periodically taiwan.

I highly confident, numbers old top higher numbers young. Oh, yes agree. would unreasonable expect every teacher required one two children, may may class. Fair enough, agree that. agree staying indoors forever never reach herd immunity. wish idiot anti-vaxxers would get part community. unvaccinated wait, believe me. wait

So think fair 25 year olds banned sport, pubs, social contact, retail shopping restaurants, legally allowing 50 year olds things even go holiday? 

Bear mind 50 year olds still capable spreading virus, since vaccines 100% effective. U.S. health care conglomerate Johnson &amp; Johnson said Monday one units filed regulatory approval one-shot COVID-19 vaccine Japan, could begin supplying doses country early 2022, approval According unit, Janssen Pharmaceutical K.K., Phase 1 study results 250 healthy people ages 20 55 aged 65 older Japan showed vaccine pose safety health ministry Friday gave final approval emergency use two COVID-19 vaccines ‚Äî developed U.S. pharmaceutical company Moderna Inc.

Q: Mr. Hoerr, chosen strong words debate patent protection vaccines.

Hoerr: get ‚Äúmess‚Äù use patents Biontech, Curevac Moderna without knowing exact assembly instructions. 

Q: even warn health risk post Linkedin. mean exactly?

Hoerr: patents, best, rough recipe somehow try cook something. mean ""mess"". this, understand company's patent strategy: Since knowledge disclosed every patent, every company takes care keep certain things secret patent them. remains internal knowledge. therefore consider demand release patents purely populist.

Q: copying ‚Äúrough recipe‚Äù new vaccine would created would need approved.

Hoerr: Exactly. mystery could work near future. necessary clinical trials always take long time. 

Q: demand waive patent rights mean perhaps something else altogether different? Could mean patent rights waived entire production know-how disclosed?

Hoerr: Yes, probably. can't force company simply disclose knowledge painstakingly acquired decades. would fatal consequences science medicine: would invest researching new drugs therapies future knowledge given away anyway? 

A completely different problem USA currently holding back raw materials urgently need vaccine production, which, reference national emergency, allowed exported.

Q: saying fact Curevac vaccine yet market lack supplies United States?

Hoerr: No. vaccines ongoing trials - prerequisites approval - already produced. producing hundreds millions doses vaccine big challenge.

Q: exactly talking here?

Hoerr: Among things, lack chemicals without impossible produce RNA. Many raw materials come USA.

Q: problem resolved Curevac vaccine approved?

Hoerr: hope so. German government EU Commission apparently involved, far heard. hope resolved politically.

Q: intention help whole world guideline Curevac, also interests Bill Melinda Gates Foundation, involved Curevac. contradiction knowledge passed on?

Hoerr: one hand, Curevac passes knowledge, indiscriminately, specifically qualified cooperation partners. hand, Curevac developing vaccine requires extremely low dose. also keeps production costs ultimately price individual shots down. also benefits people poor countries. problem availability. supposed vaccinate world year supply chain disrupted national interests pursued? main criticism. can't hold back raw materials benefit nation rest world go empty-handed. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Tell sound like petty bureaucrat saying ""those silly people reason line 2 kilometres! Life good here! :) ""

All nonsense, course - example, still need wait 3-4 months get second dose Canada. tragic example good initiative saved lives got shut good reason. :( disagree. Remote lesson prep *completely different* in-person.

Pretty vague... risk child harmed Covid minimal. finding long term health issues children gotten Covid.  credit go parents took get vaccinated? 

It's like 12-15 year olds driving making decisions. massive weeb knows bit Japanese, youtube lately recommending news snippets Japan Japanese.

A reporters interviewing ICU doctors nurses. One shocking revelation (from Kobe) elderly patients turned away low rate surivial treatment. Japanese great, sure sounds like level triage. seen news like English news outlet. 

Previously, Reuters reported covid positive patients dying home rather hospitals. seems like Reuters major English news reporting situation Japan? give mom credit, young lad getting vaccinations, first stop leaving doctor's office Toys R Us bought new toy. Still remember getting Weeble Wobble scuba diver getting vaccination shots. Shame's I'm getting chicks since got J&amp;J amazing hairs now! Ya. option B. I'm sorry. Health England clear evidence current vaccines slowly chipped away new variants. analysis, carried 5 April 16 May, found Pfizer vaccine 88% effective symptomatic disease India variant two weeks second dose, compared 93% effectiveness Kent strain. part, AstraZeneca jab 60% effective, compared 66% Kent variant period.

In 16 months since COVID-19 really started spreading China, Pfizer vaccine gone 93% efficacy initial strain 88% efficacy mutations. grossly overstating risk variants.

The virus mutating even remotely fast enough saying true. Mutations concern vaccines need updated correct this, virus mutating nearly fast enough make vaccines obsolete unless vaccine makers completely ignore mutations. feel-good story Montana First Nation holding COVID-19 vaccination clinics Canada-United States border southwestern Alberta come end.

Are vaccinated?  Including sister's teenage boys. Fair enough, though imma point case kind exception AFAIK better use shortage cheap excuse make microchip vaccine anymore. ...who secondary concerns country compared citizens.

Again, extremely complicated issue ""right"" answers, completely debate responsibility world vs responsibility citizens. Public Health England clear evidence current vaccines slowly chipped away new variants. UK variant Indian variant effect vaccine efficacy.

For every one vaccine give away, that's one citizen country ends unvaccinated. directly causing population become less safe name protecting hypothetical problem may may happen. Again, answer black white. True, low point middle last century. immunocompromised never safe since COVID never go away. risk mutations occurring lower level transmission children far lower risk single traveller another country bringing variant country partially evade vaccine. certainly possible mutation could occur transmission children, question probability, ultimately unlikely. parenthood.

*slowclap* fully vaccinated 5 weeks nice seeing everything flip back normal last week half. Seems masks longer needed live aside public transportation Dr's offices. Went concert Sunday baseball game Friday many happy maskless people. feel like service people pressured continue wearing them. Maybe I'm wrong completely choice, feels classist times they're ones wearing them. Hope companies making clear drop vaccination. also imagine 10 countries paid 75% funding vaccine research production, though. countries majorly funded research vaccines, exactly great argument vaccinating people first. Sometimes forget species bad used it. 

Your grandparents probably know scary measles polio experience. Kids nowadays probably know/care, imo, possible could see antivaxxer movements whatnot forget more

No historian ever antivaxxer LOL experience 15 year old. He'd read lot rumors online knows he's high risk disease. told body him, gave better resources read changed mind went ahead.

There's also typically periodic outbreaks various orthodox (unvaccinated) Jewish communities, typically NYC regular intervals. might eliminate measles US number years, always seems come back small outbreak like this.

We see higher levels covid population US countries travel high enough vaccination levels, similar measles. knew people would jump gun paint trying downplay good situation getting included I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs still better previous Sunday comparison

So saying actually means tracing people 15 contact with, could mean lot 15 people traced?

If really rephrase that. mean lasted like week. West Coast dealing apocalyptic hellfire months every summer like, 5 years. Last year Northern California Oregon several days bad sky red. even going dock Texas snowstorm, yeah, could lot worse. test 2 days afterwards well. trial events only. Yay. Way go! mean we're UK teenagers seem mind. teenagers want, makes sense. risk COVID teen miniscule. biggest risk future teens vaccine stops working older people reimpose restrictions, worse parents/grandparents die. probability happening far lower vaccinate adults countries, rather vaccinating teens high vaccine countries.

first question: pause unvaccinated games concerts? yes, definitely deadly virus more

second : vaccinated get infected spread vaccines work like magic. cases positive vaccinated resulted statistically irrelevant hospitalizations spread even cases reduced immune system

what do? allow vaccinated go back normal life impose mask unvaccinated. Simple think general acceptance aerosols common cause transmission type virus help us future outbreaks variants new viruses. really big step right direction lot recommendations protect people sneezing coughing breathing. Ahh, must Ontario, then. pretty bad here. Yeah, good point. hand:

So potentially could make sense either divert resources away Moderna reduce dosage. shows everything workers saying throughout pandemic ‚Äî subjected unsafe working conditions, exposed high risk, going incur costs address COVID, either missing work medical care, horrific circumstances death family‚Äôs loss loved ones ‚Äî true. affirming. workers saying throughout confirmed independent adjudicators recognizing companies put workers harm‚Äôs way,‚Äù Muraskin said. acting like vaccine solution. get vaccinated mask, part problem. virus replicates regardless vaccine (even CDC confirmed transmission lowered vaccine).

People get vaccinated people still spread disease. vaccine prevents one hospitalization/dying, great, prevent long covid. multiple warning past 20nyears texas needs improve infrastructure winterize grid always ignore federal recommendations so. past 20 years there's also multiple brown/black outs one absolute worst.

There's plenty time fix it, Texas gov want elderly patients turned away low rate surivial treatment.

This always worst case scenario. Saving 30 year old makes sense saving 80 year old (to them). reduces chances outcomes ever occurring. better little Johnny catching covid locker room, asymptomatic, killing grandparents catch him.

See, we're trying reduce overall number cases, rather letting virus kill weaker friends loved ones, also stop spread variants dangerous.

And, frankly, I'm going roll dice hope 12-year-old one lucky kids better outcome, rather [one kids might get left long-haul case we're even sure long-term problems going True‚Ä¶but still coincidence right? believe little 20%

There many statements made June could beat COVID, testing tracing everyone wearing N95 masks. thing many countries implemented still much worse second wave first wave. like forgot natural disasters like occur, depending preparedness, general profile society, full suppression never possible March 15th. feel like actual room maneuver push virus smaller humans actually like admit, people still speak certainty ""if xyz could 'beat' thing"". discourse online media, many public health officials participated in, encouraged type thinking could predict would happen. predictions sort became narrative. Even though virus started rapidly spreading October still seen Thanksgiving surge.

[The lifting mask mandates similar narrative, pan out, nobody went back corrected problem predictions wrong without communicating uncertainty decreases peoples trust institutions. Instead saying 'we know happen think help' people said 'if end this' even though unknown achievable.

There's WAG factor, play numbers: Let's say herd immunity happens ~65% population resistant, vaccines 90% effective preventing people becoming contagious, US 75% adults, 25% population resistant already disease.

Then 80% adult population vaccinated, 75%*80%=60% population vaccinated, 90% - 54% general population - resistant vaccination. And, 40% un-vaccinated population, quarter - 10% general population - resistant recovering. would give total 64% population resistant right around hypothetical herd immunity threshold.

Of course garbage - garbage situation: Pick different numbers start different result. 

On side issue, there's question much various anti-covid measures actually cost.

Additionally, evidence virus jumped animals humans wet market. However, media reported case everyone still thinks that's happened even though debunked. KMT power Taiwan. see CDC's notes Texas vaccination data reporting page measures uses estimate national statistics: says provides aggregate dose count data CDC; therefore, receive specific information individual dose level. limits ability directly calculate certain age-based metrics.

The political tension also irrelevant Taiwan trades Mainland China time. 

The factor ruling party doesn‚Äôt want lose popularity gained anti-China. There‚Äôs pretty big difference actions take individual actions government take policy level. vaccinate children soon possible. Even wanted to, you, individual, can‚Äôt transfer vaccine someone risk. Vaccines arrived local vaccination sites wasted go unused. 

The debate researcher trying encourage policy level decisions. Even newer variants, children notably less likely contract transmit COVID. virtue age, starting immune response equivalent adult given hypothetical, moderately effective vaccine. Given that, it‚Äôs reasonable argue that, vaccine would reduce risk children, risk already low enough (especially adults around vaccinated) safely redirect vaccines high risk populations abroad without throwing children bus.

Personally, find vaccine nationalism disgusting. Offering vaccine people incredibly low risk denying high risk people purely born wrong side imaginary line morally bankrupt shortsighted. don‚Äôt understand trading small number deaths prevent several orders magnitude death isn‚Äôt ethical choice. There‚Äôs reason value someone‚Äôs life happened born country me. depends age. paper says fully vaccinated people 94% less likely hospitalised covid. 20x reduction (which still source shows hospitalisation risk elderly (all unvaccinated) 10-15x higher 18-29 year olds. fatality rate hundred x higher.

So case, wrong, vaccinated elderly person lower hospitalisation rate unvaccinated young adult. see difference extreme though, plus include deaths gets paper lists effectiveness (Table 2) pfizer vaccine reducing infection, hospitalisation death, age. TLDR numbers 90something% effective ages infection,hospitalisation death reduction.

The simple answer vaccines make invincible based numbers, bring average 75+ year old's risk approximately mid 20's unvaccinated adult. logic elderly vaccinated people let loose unvaccinated people (who even given opportunity vaccinated) allowed freedoms. know research you‚Äôre talking about, two things play here.

The first that, sibling comment mentions, could totally natural still brought Wuhan coronavirus researchers leaked lab. Researchers WIV particular going bat caves southern China hunting coronavirus samples there, indeed that‚Äôs closest known natural relative SARS-CoV-2 came from.

The that...well, research *wasn‚Äôt good*. basically presumed one particular way virus could‚Äôve constructed non-natural argued signs particular method, virus must natural. doesn‚Äôt account things like ‚Äúno-see-um‚Äù techniques undetectably alter viruses, gain-of-function serial passage, wholly natural - guided evolution action.

There‚Äôs article Bulletin Atomic Scientists covers that‚Äôs worth seeking out, money True, older methods cutting pasting viral genomes retain tell-tale signs manipulation. newer methods, called ‚Äúno-see-um‚Äù ‚Äúseamless‚Äù approaches, leave defining marks. methods manipulating viruses serial passage, repeated transfer viruses one culture cells another. virus manipulated, whether seamless method serial passage, way knowing First, say spike protein SARS2 binds well target, human ACE2 receptor, different way physical calculations suggest would best fit. Therefore virus must arisen natural selection, argument seems hard grasp, it‚Äôs it‚Äôs strained. authors‚Äô basic assumption, spelt out, anyone trying make bat virus bind human cells could one way. First would calculate strongest possible fit human ACE2 receptor spike protein virus latches onto it. would design spike protein accordingly (by selecting right string amino acid units compose it). Since SARS2 spike protein calculated best design, Andersen paper says, therefore can‚Äôt ignores way virologists fact get spike proteins bind chosen targets, calculation splicing spike protein genes viruses serial passage. serial passage, time virus‚Äôs progeny transferred new cell cultures animals, successful selected one emerges makes really tight bind human cells. Natural selection done heavy lifting. Andersen paper‚Äôs speculation designing viral spike protein calculation bearing whether virus manipulated one two authors‚Äô second argument manipulation even contrived. Although living things use DNA hereditary material, number viruses use RNA, DNA‚Äôs close chemical cousin. RNA difficult manipulate, researchers working coronaviruses, RNA-based, first convert RNA genome DNA. manipulate DNA version, whether adding altering genes, arrange manipulated DNA genome converted back infectious certain number DNA backbones described scientific literature. Anyone manipulating SARS2 virus ‚Äúwould probably‚Äù used one known backbones, Andersen group writes, since SARS2 derived them, therefore manipulated. argument conspicuously inconclusive. DNA backbones quite easy make, it‚Äôs obviously possible SARS2 manipulated using unpublished DNA backbone.

 that‚Äôs it. two arguments made Andersen group support declaration SARS2 virus clearly manipulated. conclusion, grounded nothing two inconclusive speculations, convinced world‚Äôs press SARS2 could escaped lab. Check local vaccine sites end day, look traveling areas uptake aggressive cities (if can; know FR lockdowns strict). lot us found even appointments available, showing person allowed lot folks get leftovers. CDC also says 2nd dose given 6 weeks first valid need repeated reported clinical whole document interesting reading - get sense prioritizes ""getting shots arms"" ""doing things book"" trying really hard get everyone book).

‚Äú Barring that, want talk morality vaccinating elderly at-risk globally first, let‚Äôs consider less risk (including low risk people 20s, 30s, even 40s possibly) waiting. targeting kids parents morally legally required protect doomed failure. It‚Äôs way complaining criticizing, knowing full well won‚Äôt change status quo. first world country going delay vaccinating kids it‚Äôs known safe vaccinate them.

The time discussion started vaccinating low risk adults ages.

Or really, vaccines finalized sold.

Edit: vaccinating elderly high risk (largely high density) poorer areas won‚Äôt reduce chance mutations. aren‚Äôt ones contributing spread much. Plus could vaccinate everyone 45+ India would still ~ 17% population vaccinated.

To reduce mutations would also need prioritize vaccination based population density, multigenerational living, cultural economic factors nobody wants either.‚Äù Vaccines distributed feds per capita basis Texas got almost 5x shots Maryland. get arms.  Random question: anyone aware real world analysis effective j j been?  Secede. Refuse pay taxes either government fix it. 

Fill formal declaration independence. Also fill paperwork full unconditional surrender sign date it. Attach notice unconditional surrender signed whenever federal forces establish lines communication. Agreed. enrollment caps hindrance, fill way sooner parents realize. can't wait see things look start August decide put kid online charter point.

And also, parents high risk kids (and unvaxxed siblings!) might want remote safe put kids back person, ""forever"" thing, many districts exclude kids sports, extracurriculars, services could keep engaged in-line in-person peers, making hard decision transfer make harder transition back in. Districts addressing cooperative would really helpful. local liquor store sign says ‚ÄúEvery employee vaccinated! Come in!‚Äù

I love it. I‚Äôve used think they‚Äôre accurate?? I‚Äôm fully vaxxed taking tests super precaution I‚Äôve hanging different ppl. They‚Äôre 85% accurate take less 30 mins get results I‚Äôm fairly sure testing people going countries quarantine process wait results. sure policy testing people otherwise. get meme vaccines offered every street corner America Tom, Dick Harry regardless age? sure hell happen like live. wait turn age like everybody else.

It depends state located. California example self declared high risk medical condition essential worker never checked. let eager people slip order get shots arms. Yeah remember people late March/April 2020 saying things like ""if lockdown rest month, we'll beat amazing summer"" like... have. Honestly seems like without vaccines, America would never ""beaten"" covid even much stricter quarantine measures. place bad takes. Oh haha love it. No, downvotes invalidate you.

‚ÄúThat lazy dishonest.‚Äù

I asked:

‚Äú Tell see non-lazy honest option me?‚Äù

I trying understand see lazy dishonest. Since example gave reading two opposing articles littering littering, isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd remotely consider doing. 

I‚Äôm happy consider comment and/or argument one applies. far doesn‚Äôt. son born June last year. live city grandparents still work. first 8 months life one else watch could take nap catch anything. think we've definitely come side stronger damn wish could've taken friend's houses. True, really make sense include anyone 16 estimates vaccine willingness access vaccine long time. I‚Äôm writing points you‚Äôre emotionally invested, considered addressed arguments above.

I wrote last comment wanted highlight despite disagreeing stance, genuinely believe position far stronger one, I‚Äôm understanding position assume uniquely impacted personal situation hence don‚Äôt experience typical aggregate.

If we‚Äôre operating assumption impressively able divorce act purely rational observer, find less sympathetic.

Regardless, I‚Äôve made points you‚Äôve made yours, really much else discuss, readers decide who‚Äôs made stronger argument. Best luck future. stories said specificity sensitivity ahead rapid tests.

The issue course can't adopt dog. There's high cost training. get home training kit (TM) gimmick (or limited tool border control etc). stuff happening across country. mayor Philadelphia banned indoor dining every restaurant due severe safety concerns. seen restaurant Maryland. like others, including SARS, find ancestral virus lab theories evaporate. **Methodology** 
The Post adjusted covid-19 rates cases, deaths hospitalization time combining Centers Disease Control Prevention data cases, hospitalization vaccinations. Post used rolling seven-day average daily cases, deaths hospitalization. vaccination, Post used number people received least one shot date. 
For events like covid-19 infection, rates usually calculated dividing number cases number people population. example, 12 cases among population 100 people, rate would 12 people per 100. Post reduced denominator exclude vaccinated people. 20 people got vaccinated, would mean 12 cases remaining 80 unvaccinated people, adjusted rate 15 cases per 100 people. 
Vaccination perfect preventing infections, however, Post subtract entire population vaccinated people. Data shows vaccines 90 percent effective preventing cases among people received shot. Cases among vaccinated people called breakthrough cases. conservative, Post estimated 15 percent vaccinated population could still infected. 
So, example above, instead removing 20 vaccinated people, Post removed 17. would leave 12 cases among 83 people, adjusted rate 14.5 cases per 100 people. 
The Post calculated adjusted rates cases, deaths hospitalization nation state since start vaccination December. Apples oranges. like 10% Fukushima tsunami every week! incredible hypocrite. Disgusting human being. Shut go useless somewhere else.  Yeah, tend agree this. makes sense allow either proof vaccination negative test 24 hours event. protect everyone allow people can't get vaccine (either age, religious affiliation, medical reasons) participate. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

Well done! Yes, successfully demonstrated measuring per capita deaths countries fewer 5000 people helpful.

This math checks exactly.

1 (deaths) / 5000 (population Montserrat) * 1,300,000,000 (population India) = Total deaths India date. never thought particularly smart, although family members used tell was, growing up. graduated top 20% high school class, went college, etc. always thought average.

This whole last years made realize, ""holy shit country really filled LOT stupid ass people, way thought...I'd better step game country needs descendants save itself, apparently"" ;-). seems number favorable, would title. tried opening ""not yet peer reviewed"" study, link working me. *realistic* % unvaccinated adults would comfortable everything reopen normally masks proof vaccination? 100% realistic various reasons (recent infection, immunocompromised, etc.). 

I always figured high % vaccinated, plus infected (mostly asymptomatic), would push us herd immunity line. line even defined, I've seen anywhere 70% 85% 90% without research backing claims. info share please do! Even they're 10 they're still bottom half per capita deaths.

The median age India 26 compared 40 years western countries. India, large, simply numbers elderly possible high IFR. 

That guys desperate believe apocalypse telling. Fair enough, regarding ‚Äúif‚Äù statement. Laughs common sense natural immunity also counts towards herd immunity. Still, Canada 50% total population least one dose, US 50% total population least one dose, despite earlier availability people US. think that's fair statement. He's saying investigation compromised China's stonewalling cover-up, steps need taken assure Wuhan lab following proper safety protocols. think regardless actual ""source"" need go next step address lack safeguards allowed localized epidemic blow pandemic.

States always control shut downs mask mandates (Trump never ordered states shut down), can't blame Biden lack presence shut downs. try blame trying convince states shut putting federally mandated mask law, missing critical piece puzzle: vaccines. Vaccines began distributed end Trump's term basically exist. can't compare one person wanting normal real way stop spread virus versus vaccine already given risk (elderly, pre-existing conditions, medical field, etc) even people get infected, deaths hospitalizations way down. That's big deal. anti China manufactured virus allegations

Pretty much viruses high R0 value respiratory viruses. exceptions ones spread insects, like malaria. Curevac invent supply chain bottle-neck that's due DPA. Serum Institute India previously announced able produce Novavax DPA. DPA effect supply chain fact. deny it? propose waiver IP rights, controversial, throttling global supply chain vaccine materials, makes hard non-US producers make vaccines? 

There evidence show Pfizer Moderna starved supplies US allow exports. Moderna Pfizer existing supply chain established affected. Continuing DPA amounts starving world vaccines order give US companies competitive advantage.

If CureVac start vaccine production now, able supply vaccines approved June. understand it, CureVac producing million doses needs supplies ramp production. thought get approved. 

The first vaccine necessarily best vaccine. reason limit supply two mRNA vaccine makers. enlarging field competition drive price improve product. 

With US producing vaccine shelve, justification continuing disrupt supply chain DPA. CureVac definite advantages especially vaccinating 3rd world. Pfizer vs J&amp;J? excuse something disadvantaged minority kids, guess. Well, clarify, need quarantine. negative test prior departure skip even rapid test upon landing (a Maui specific requirement).

Especially since majority people clearly left leaning. ok make decisions body comes abortion gender comes vaccine? let people put whatever want bodies without crucifying it? want abortion get vaccine shoot heroin change gender allowed without criticism. body, one else's.

Of course there‚Äôs non-zero chance actually bad variant emerge, I‚Äôve learned chances variant mutating much it‚Äôs able strangely vaccine resistant still functioning, disease causing, easily spread virus small. There‚Äôs much virus change becoming something entirely different.

Suffice say I‚Äôm done listening anyone mentioning variants discussing moves making moving forward.  thank reasoning.  actually paid attention buffets people do? Sneeze cough hands touch serving items plates trays and..., grab food hands eat standing, tasting food go, letting disgusting offspring touch handle food.

Didn't Israel UK strict lock downs well? attributing improvement vaccine then? 

Where say chinese vaccines better Pfizer Moderna? Clearly best technology far, although long-term effects still unknown.

What symptoms? bad ‚Äúbad‚Äù compared times you‚Äôve sick? 

Are heavy drinker? 

How old you?  Moderna? I‚Äôm beginning think got worst vaccine, never release info it.  honest tests, they're negative (as thus far), forget log them. always think I'll later, bother. positive, would almost certainly log it, I'd take action case anyway going out. father keeps sending articles Pfizer vaccine killing people refusing let get vaccinated
I'm tired acting like man.. scientist medical professional said variants deadly? Please stop hysteria bot. Yeah, also got good chowda reason people may multiple destinations. putting removing mask multiple times, there's risk transmission touching. Easier whole trip. Plus wearing mask uncomfortable people.  I'm term ""vaccinated"" applies someone 2 weeks 2nd dose (or first J&amp;J). Vermont governor using term mean people one dose?

Also (serious question) someone circle recently referred two people ""vaccinated"" know two never received vaccine, covid last year. people often call others vaccinated covid? one really getting tested anymore unless - tracking hospitalizations indicator vaccines 33% effective symptomatic disease Indian variant three weeks first dose, compared 50% Kent strain‚Äù study done Public Health England (PHE).  fact Sinopharm efficacy 79%.

Based weak studies data believed many fact AZ banned many countries.

Yes, countries option using safer effective fact China main recipients Sinopharm vaccine far less cases Israel western world. prove vaccine efficacy?

Which nothing vaccine bring up? China less cases went severe lockdown nationally making sure virus spread worldwide. never mentioned ‚Äúwestern world‚Äù bring up? Paranoid saying?

That despite months research compared nations companies around world, China still produced inferior vaccine. negotiable, fact. Show vaccine China effective Moderna Pfizer vaccine. Always vote president believe science. South African variant shown escape vaccines well natural immunity every study seen. 

Novavax 90 percent wild type, 50 percent SA. Natural immunity like 30 percent trial 

AstraZeneca like 60 vs 10 percent

Pfizer 95 vs 75 percent Qatar data

J J like 80 vs 60 percent thing wanting one mRNA vaccines (either Moderna Pfizer), efficacy numbers damn high.

Ended getting Pfizer, awesome. Indoors vs outdoors Anyone know close Oregon is? We‚Äôre 53% entire population vaccinated haven‚Äôt able find steady &amp; reliable source percentage eligible/adult population Correct literally called ""the new democratic hoax"" politicized masks ok understand it.

Of course Moderna vaccine amazing vacuum would brainer.

But reality vaccines getting vaccinated important me‚Ä¶if could get choice clicking couple extra websites, sure I‚Äôd that. wouldn‚Äôt let delay shots days so‚Ä¶but given choice I‚Äôll make choice.

Again, Moderna shot amazing. might prefer Pfizer, J&amp;J it‚Äôs one shot. Expecting informed people think unrealistic. TN, KY, SC, around size Maine.

definitely trip never late. Stopping one superspreader means hundreds possibly thousands people spared virus. countries US. US control testing requirements flights going US.

When traveling abroad internationally, expected follow covid restrictions country entering, regardless vaccination status country differentiate. Make sure well aware go. agree. partner fell lazy /slash we'll another day sure. got first shot today walmart bc pharmacist came intercom saying wait. like Bob Barker telling us come down. Haha.  Semiconductors Taiwan's biggest card economic therefore military ties US, US stopping rely means become vurnerable invasion China. think Taiwan give away position easily.

There‚Äôs reason budesonide similar meds class first long acting bronchodilator use mild persistent asthma worse. Also it‚Äôs inhaled lower amount going systemic. It‚Äôs ideal benefits outweigh risks.

Now juxtapose dexamethasone covid. 1.) don‚Äôt truly know benefit. There‚Äôs suggestion decreased mortality issues study. 2.) don‚Äôt truly know risk, there‚Äôs numerical trend towards higher mortality nonhospitalized patients steroids general lot side effects including opportunistic infections like mucor, PCP pneumonia, etc. 3.) still don‚Äôt truly know covid kills us. finally 4.) don‚Äôt know steroids effective covid. said that, it‚Äôs still best right (I don‚Äôt believe remdesivir nothing else really sticks it‚Äôs initial hype follow trials suggest doesn‚Äôt really much either)

And finally, I‚Äôm saying shouldn‚Äôt use steroids covid. I‚Äôm sayin, study clear regimen patient could benefit lot us haven‚Äôt following properly think misinterpreted point hung word, world. first words say he‚Äôs referring vaccinated people. insulin cost 10-100x states countries? 

Because it‚Äôs better? Nope
Because supply issues? Nope 

Because private companies don‚Äôt give shit? Yes! received excellent vaccine good protection infection excellent protection severe illness death. 

Johnson Johnson performed well variants, including difficult South African variant. 

You're great position protect community. understand can't really control actions nations. Governments vaccinate people, put strict rules international travel, help countries financial aid vaccines hope best.    would cost $2000? making shit up. dishonest stupid.         wrong. already explained US healthcare expensive. profit model regulatory capture insurance industry. GOVERNMENT rules drive price creating monopolies. FFS lie die, actively killing people. health insurers ZERO competition territories created state driving prices UP. fucking wrong. People dying idiots can't understand simple economic principles call killing poor. sickening.  Wow... pretty much full year Israeli's exactly this.  Naw. 
I personal friends family chewed spit system there. understand designed funnel money wrong people destroys many lives glorious dollar. 

At time say cannot improve healthcare, privatization slippery slope one cannot easily claw back goes wrong, will, greed. 

Good day  looking cohort vaccinated people, coronavirus longer infectious disease world needs worry about.

This sentence makes zero sense current situation across world. Something like 85-90% worlds population vaccinated yet.   young people suffered enough protect elderly

lol, another case misinformed *young people* whining unfair treatment. bring shame upon millions informed young people have, like rest country, followed rules protect NHS, vulnerable people, includes hell lot *young people*.

Wish would hurry vaccination/cure stupidity ignorance. According [Financial Japan's case rate per capita never 5 cases/100K/day; compare 88 seen UK, understand reports Japan's health care system 'falling apart'.

Compared countries, nearly terrible elsewhere. J&amp;J provides good protection infection excellent protection severe illness death. shown strong performance tougher South African variant well. 

It's great vaccine. risk getting moderate severe covid vaccinated person ? Even better, would helpful know risk comparison activities people choose engage regularly. Dying car accident, plane, ect. You‚Äôd happy live world fire department attend house fire use ladder pay $2,000 surcharge you‚Äôve got Silver House Fire Protection Package deluxe gold one? state kids consent vaccines? Made using MRNA tech developed similarly Pfizer cell create stable spike protein. Functionally similar Pfizer, similar protection outlook. 

You got remarkably effective vaccine. sweat it. Honestly, got Astra, Pfizer, Moderna, JNJ, (possibly others): protected severe illness, great position keep community healthy. sincere. choice.

Healthcare one things doesn‚Äôt work. things like house fire burglary. Notice things publicly run funded it‚Äôs nonsense private firm it, healthcare different.

If heart attack choice have? None, absolutely none. phone 911 send ambulance, charge whatever hell want. hospital, get given list 10 hospitals choose price list each? shit, take wherever closest that‚Äôll accept again, pay whatever charge.

US healthcare far expensive healthcare system per capita, despite one worst coverage population. Eww... passive aggressiveness showing. moronic take ignorant person lives highly vaccinated country, regard going majority rest world. either American Israeli? 

Again, sound assumption. seems like take day Peloton hungover. now, figured solve developing world's problems? Prick.  would love nothing send doses going unused. privileged morons refusing get vaccinated like crime humanity people would give anything vaccinated parts world. Stay strong, friend. Interesting. Netherlands that's yet accepted all.

Ultimately goal would get back peers, takes 2-3 years risk falling far behind academically? point unless person making recommendations admits smarter CDC doctors, fully ignore say.  F*CKING LOVE SCIENCE! üòç absolutely. big concerts ball games? talking concerts ball games, correct? Herd immunity doesn‚Äôt mean 0 cases. It‚Äòs statistical threshold likelihood transmission. Vaccination rates 40-65 still much higher 12-40. 

As much reddit loves go ""old people dumb"", predominantly young people getting vaccinated. started ""just flu, bro"". 

And added edit. So, no. Fuck that.

I serious doubts started talking vaccinated.  65+ year olds probably aren‚Äôt still parents teens. areas higher rates vaccine refusal, funny areas seeing increase cases now... certainly seems case. Canada, people clamouring shots - standing line, spending hours trying book appointments, begging chance get shot. We‚Äôre 50% least one shot, it‚Äôs lack supply keeping us getting 2 shots. opened adults eligible appointments tough get.  think Canada reach least 75% supply available. 

From I‚Äôve heard, pretty much every adult U.S. wants shot opportunity get one less 50% done it.  doesn‚Äôt bode well guys. still don‚Äôt understand got politicized States, point mainstream medical knowledge ignored much public.  Sure we‚Äôve got anti-vaxxers anti-mask crackpots too, pretty rare live.  TF get downvoted for? I'm doomsday, science.

Truthfully, downvoted countries reach heard immunity fast enough create new VOC causing immune escape. Back square 1.

We *not* back square 1. spike protein change much virus behave way does, vaccines target protein. So, likelihood, new variants emerge, stymie vaccine, gradual thing, efficacy reduced, zero. seen far. idea new variant going pop up, different reduce efficacy vaccines zero, hyperbolic absolutely grounded science.

Additionally, really good designing, producing, distributing mRNA vaccines. FDA said follow expedited approval process boosters variants, US shown capability distribute 4-5 million doses per day. means could distribute boosters want/need 1-2 months. doable. Again, back square 1. think isn't.

Theres obviously case (as demonstrated) using loaded language misinterpreted one careful word choice.

However think something point vaccine effectiveness. Firstly think important world anti vaxxers communicate vaccines work. ""big sell"" (soon) -can- get lives back.... everyone vaccinated. study (i.e. original post) demonstrates beautifully.
I think polio example valid flipped head. Obviously bad disease, one -have- beaten. disease past, sense, absolutely -not- risk anyone.  covid heading (.... get vaccinated!). There‚Äôs way school system would pay teacher essentially remote learning retainer. probably isn‚Äôt handful kids (across grades) would need remote learning. least Virginia VAK12 free online public school. kid needs remote would offered instead. There‚Äôs much online teaching teaching wearing camera. talking about? Nobody made go subreddit. yourself. disagree. could treated like specialty classroom. Like self contained special education class, advanced learners class. kids specified already smaller contained classes (both district) attempt meet needs, working. Also school district PAY district placement, push back quite bit agreeing times. (Not school districts, common problem). district also allows children shorter term emergencies take advantage well. (Such little Johnny suddenly 6 months Chemo, can't go school. Suzie got car accident. Normally would get home tutor situation, online learning COULD option well.) mean, obviously.

Well obvious antivax nuts likely ruin lot herd immunity efforts.  Good see attempts Abbott Co. keep children poorly educated, kids got sense stick GQP know what‚Äôs right them. Vaccination rates much lower young old. 

85%+ 65+ year olds vaccinated. basically parents right thing behalf kids? Since kids need parental consent get shot, doubt many kids getting shot whose parents already gotten shot. long doses? giving doses close together issue. cases doses 3 weeks apart might need third one. unless doses months months apart okay UK gone 12 weeks good result. No. vaccinated fine even states open 70%. BUT, people still fairly high risk. immunocompromised instance kids 12 comfortable small risk getting severe case vaccinations available later year early next.

Herd immunity prevents edge cases legitimately can't get immunity via vaccination. really, really. death rate vaccinated people tiny

Yeah, that.. really count. comment implied fear warranted. was, describe. used rough 600k dead imagine millions hospitalized. haven't, numbers failing grades drop outs back up.

Kids need able correctly socialize peers. That's arguably important book learning, group kids online learning stunt that. Yes, maybe entire generation refuse obey they‚Äôre parents! Yay, hope better tomorrow! Yeah great. already can't get PS5, Xbox series X, latest greatest PC graphics card walking store buying one.

You get online pay scalper highway robbery fee/a king's ransom them. deal Taiwan make situation even worse assume.

This major implications world economy. surprising one country allowed sole provider something critical life days. Like could possibly go wrong scenario right? Duh. would fall special education/IDEA/least restrictive environment guidelines. Symptoms following exposure indicative infection. likely outcome body neutralizes virus becomes infection. vaccinated symptoms following known COVID exposure CDC recommends get tested follow quarantine guidance. happy receive Moderna, even previously Covid.

No side effects arm soreness tiredness first dose.

Second dose resulted soreness injection site. 

Both MUCH better dealing Covid.  teaching K12 students simple producing video recording lesson we'd spend far less education do. Teaching interactive process requires actually interacting kid, online minority kids works well, can't sending kid video classroom. can't speak everyone's experience, sign several places parent/guardian paperwork. Kids anxiety need around peers grow they'll never able function society. bad anxiety can't go school, need medicated something, bigger problems anxiety point. [Yup, kids better remotely aren‚Äôt. Surprised they‚Äôd take totally table may double work offer options.

By by, anxiety lot causes treatment plans, (at risk overgeneralizing) *consistency* provides sufferers sense safety relief. 

It really depends whether student‚Äôs environment (school vs home) provide individuals‚Äô needs; students really struggle homes chaotic relieved opportunity go structured school day, really crappy, chaotic schools opposite true. What‚Äôs COVID fatality rate teens? aren‚Äôt necessarily bound school district comes online public school. online charter schools take kids state.

The vast majority families want send kids back in-person school fall. one two kids per grade want stay full-remote, schools expend resources make new class two stragglers?  number absolute pure fiction.

Publishing article based wildly inaccurate statement government official simply irresponsible journalism. so? Dogs are, anything else, great smelling. UK variant emerged last autumn area country initially low levels virus. take lot problematic variant emerge. would help included date death press releases etc. places like Worldometers could adjust graphs accordingly. decade now! Stop regurgitating fact. There's frogs hair chance get asymptomatic, there's evidence pass  I'm sure effective B117 new variants. Countries dealt OG covid way starting outbreaks now.

Vaccines answer imo. Except didn't. Tennessee isn‚Äôt much better. 40%, mask sight anywhere. Spoken like someone doesn‚Äôt any.

In one way, Curevac trouble finding materials ingredients I‚Äôm OK know used approved, good vaccines. Curevac don‚Äôt even know it‚Äôs effective. share links YouTube vids? Don‚Äôt parent‚Äôs permission? Pretty sure vaxxed parents‚Äô kids ... message becomes even clearer: get vaccinated asap ! Oh that‚Äôs amazing, home tests game changer. Even quite accurate per test pcr, frequency testing kind makes difference. Fingers crossed government approve soon too. Yeah, case requiring negative test attend large events makes sense it‚Äôs something people relatively easily even know question means. Obviously two options vaccinate don't. Lot journalists looking pretty stupid now, what‚Äôs new? Ah laws gonna get vaccinated. Texas family aren‚Äôt. Guess welcome house. Please please please unfollow never refer EFD again. many reputable qualified people hear anything COVID related, especially UK. serial spreader borderline actual disinformation. UK variant problem right affecting younger age groups they've chosen roll vaccines age, problem noticeable backdrop incredibly low case numbers nation-wide. They're averaging fewer 10 COVID deaths per day entire country. Please let EFD get riled up, worth time. * UK study found Pfizer's vaccine 88% effective two doses AstraZeneca's 60%.
* single dose either vaccine 33% effective, highlighting importance second shot.

From study UK released Saturday night middle Eurovision trying hide it. I'm starting think government using pandemic solution country's near-immortal pension-draining elderly population. Yikes. Bunch tools. Without ‚Äúdecision uproot society‚Äù we‚Äôd well 1 million dead America alone. Likely much higher that. put context we‚Äôve [about 1.35 million military deaths U.S. profess knowledgeable yet sadly unbelievably ignorant. He's vaccinated though..so point trying make?  one difference see lot states like Texas many businesses kept mandates, CDC guidelines gone soon aren‚Äôt already. Even though don‚Äôt think see huge surge, uptick younger kids still can‚Äôt get vaccinated, beyond group think pretty strong overlap people weren‚Äôt wearing masks anyway refusing vaccinated, people already covid. Hopefully existing immunity group slower spread general summer avoid big surge fall. youngest 7. I'm ready able take swimming park library without worry anti-vaxxers. Read article stop obsessing me. you‚Äôre wrong filled hyperbole. would trust person's medical advice even doctor?

I think disingenuous framing. reality, difference ""medical advice"" ""actionable public policy."" people see taking issue CDC *aren't* disagreeing medical science medical expertise CDC. Instead, raising issues related best apply known medical science create rational public policy.

Now, obviously, people saying know *strictly standpoint demonstrable medical science CDC,* dismissed *regardless* smart can't back claims scientific facts evidence.

That nothing CDC expertise though. That's basic science. best evidence carry day, regardless ""smart"" person presenting evidence. Better evidence dismissed like/respect credentials person showed CDC Covid research anyone else planet.

Again, difference disagreeing medical science vs. disagreeing medical science translated actionable public policy.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* still sit 30s, shot sight.. thank germany top aides become rather fluent violating guidance orders. Right. implies face scare resources, nations focus people first. 

For wealthy nations printing money get Covid, prolonging time shut (and thus printing money) would lead even inflation. absolutely would effect inside countries currently waiting vaccines. Inflation capacity kill lot people already struggling make ends meet. Can‚Äôt wait till kids old enough vote. Look. can‚Äôt give vaccine someone another country. feel way it, sadly give kids cuz can. Correct you‚Äôd pretty damn stupid get it. comment articles already posted actually work?  doctor seem make difference. People still smoke eat like crap even doctors tell to. [fat turd Chris Christie probably changed minds getting hospitalized anyone's doctors could.

(edit - cleaned language) stupid bet actually would motivate people, especially motivate people encourage people know it. 


Pizza party first 5 states hit 75%!! violate rule put place state.

If safe (and I'm inclined agree was), removed rule already state, decided break own. Texas youth liberal af BC not, prefer ON/US way, try find vaccine shot online refresh, BC wait government email 0 control. Found former classmate. Lol. Heart disease cancer caused single virus neither contagious. also can't stopped (in cases) physical barrier vaccine.

I think person's point that, things getting better, we're woods yet. thing blind optimism, constant parade ""good news"" headlines hides fact far places, least states mentioned headline far lower vaccination rates. point wary putting guard declaring ""mission accomplished"" we're thousands deaths per week opposed tens thousands. (and mean federal government) set higher standards that. ‚ÄúJust one month‚Äù isn‚Äôt instant gotcha think is, people saying last March. sub already. old news point. 

The link still dead, new people, commenting something can't read?  need check sources. FL had/has deaths per capita CA. love bring NY since realize argument BS. 

NYC one first areas hit hard Covid tightly packed people living top one another. one largest cities world population unlike cities Florida. mention cold weather driving people inside likely catch Covid. Trying compare New York state Florida joke. made statewide rule 6 people table broke scientists tried communicate uncertainty predictions/warnings, course one listened part, doom headlines media wrote response. ""If mask mandates lifted soon, might cause deaths happen, we're sure time yet, let's keep bit longer study question lift we're sure safe"" fit headline. People hear ""lifting mask mandate unsafe"" go there.  free (statefunded) homeschooling options explicitly kids already. Paralysis analysis mortality rate places overrun hospitals? lot places people dying home mortality rates lot worse. simple: get vaccinated wait vaccine available

Ive waiting year 3 months, wait  Dude same.. didn‚Äôt posit without bias. addressed points extended olive branch. It‚Äôs softening language. Clearly decided take offence, intent didn‚Äôt use major argument - addressed points earlier on.

As last paragraph, still don‚Äôt get - arguments weren‚Äôt lockdowns isolation sucked outright everyone - I‚Äôd argue many older asset rich actually going outright benefit lockdowns, people across age groups felt standalone pain - argument benefits avoiding wider covid spread versus cost lockdowns group. Broadly speaking position older people net benefit, wildly so. Younger people generally not. Hence younger people broadly personally sacrificed lock (negative net personal benefit, aka covid risk low, lockdown cost huge) benefit old (positive net benefit, aka covid risk high, lockdown cost lower). Maybe fine, generation two took one team haven‚Äôt really assigned value judgment it, remains case.

Again, we‚Äôve made points already much point continuing. responded attacked character. talking anyone else moment. I'm talking her.
 
Anyone enforces rules millions people ignores rules time time disgusting human being. thing.  one said vaccinated people whatever want almost 10 days ago.

A lot places updated guidances include office spaces whatever reason. also part conspiracy? Doesn‚Äôt India use AZ (UK) vaccine? live Georgia surprise iota. Definitally, understand trying keep family safe. Cant wait I'm legit crying happy kidding. thing different traveling pandemic mentioned masks. able get flight go loved ones sure hell wouldn‚Äôt complaining entire process. I‚Äôd grateful ever moment closer whatever go get there. Depends want go, Ontario‚Äôs recently unveiled new plan see things open end summer, it‚Äôs probably worth going there. Sadly, DC state. ‚òπÔ∏è Old news? happen less 24 hours ago? Perfect enemy good likely seeing here. Vaccines need rushed countries yet pandemic. planet backward. Start people likely pick virus foreigners. Airport workers, hospitality, customs agents. Anyone leaving country vaccinated return. 

Taiwan probably missed bus. single digit cases end April.  people arguing either side exact people arguing opposite year ago.

QED I'm going say Dad. miserable too. seen friends either. Plus we've added stress knowing decisions could potentially hurt ones love most. Every news story young kid struck Covid grips heart.

So please patient parents. 2020 awful every way. I'm making excuses poor parenting. Simply asking receptive they're trying better now. that's boat every parent know in. included. Yeah are, ignoring actual existing concerns.      Vax sites able accommodate VV response! good cautious point really start following science  Every single IEP meeting weve virtual student many losses theyve made need get back school. virtual physical therapy occupational therapy nearly effective? Please explain me. I'd debate speech counseling well. turned 30 year I've got mine booked Saturday, depends live He's wearing mask make political statement. That's insanely dumb lol Funny eu receive vaccines uk despite contact specifically naming uk production sites producing sites.

Wierd huh?

Money deliver covax vaccines, money useless use actually buy deliver vaccines. keep sitting high horse. EU delivering covax day one. Inkcuding astrazeneca time. stopped credible source years ago. suggest covid man-made edited. Lab workers catch viruses either tissue/animal samples, viral samples edited. Actual edited viruses hallmarks editing genome. Publishing article like flat shameful. variants dead-end scare tactic media still trying push, people falling anymore. viewpoint detached reality, plain simple. last paragraph already happen though? vaguely remember us sending people denied access getting anal swabs test covid something super bizarre. could wrong, that's I'm recalling it. reason shred evidence suggest that. 

Now report regarding scientists became ill became public, evidentiary standing SUGGEST possibility. relate. I'm UK son last year primary school. want sorted friends finish last year positive note. He's 11 autistic too, I've problem worrying bringing home.

All adults bar one vaccine, waiting greenlight kids now. ^_^  6 weeks US instead completely withdraw education therapies. Many students made losses year certainly gains. Weve kids miss 100 days. Virtual solution Lmfao.  Ok let's check couple years know what's k? I'm gonna argue something someone chooses bodies. Especially since argue want know who's right time goes by. u dont fingers growing forehead two years talk ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ worth asking question investigating ultimately conclusions need based evidence. many people accept things facts without evidence back up. evades vaccine one dose, two doses. think means safe everyone fully vaccinated, we'll fine (unless new scarier variant appears then) Well also going get B117 tearing country like Michigan.

People never learn someone else's experience, shame. Yeah counties still way closer 30% 70%. need move.   No, say that? literally say that. Link? 5 10 times that, never know true count. proven intentionally released?

What's scenario though? mad scientist goes rails releases virus public, knowledge consent Chinese government? person group people involved would criminals would end it.

On hand, seems less plausible China would intentionally release virus country would kill harm lot people, would later spread globally result global economy suffering China losing lot business. worst scenario China seems extremely implausible case. stated goal could released intentionally, know make work able keep population relatively secure.

I could come intelligent scenario kind unethical ""test"". forget China done lot work poor countries building roads, putting factories in, etc. Among medical facilities well. China wanting act evil, could test third world nation level control in. Even better would remote island nation would easily cut world. way never risk people. still seems unlikely, likely scenario view. Yeah, saw control spread anyone else did, want rest world know bad was. say anything origin though. understand wish justify expense effort went to, pick words intended upset you.

I pointed relative success Ontario's vaccination program (compared Ohio's) suggest frustration perhaps better aimed vaccination procurement, rather distribution. available supply perspective, Ontario's distribution measurably better -- small part laid feet Ontario's people stepping getting shot. 

Again, glad loved ones opportunity vaccinated early.  last line article quote doctor: ""‚ÄúSo could one \[more wave\]? Yeah, potentially ‚Äî think we‚Äôre getting close moving away extent vaccine coverage we‚Äôre seeing.‚Äù Yet article's headline scarier. definitely article, scientists. think even kids soon school out.

I'm personally waiting vaccinate 17 year old next week he's school. He's stressed catching quarantine absences finals want put extra stress case reacts shot.

And child 11 he's authorized yet. News outlets milking last pandemic things reopen profits take nosedive. Scaremongering. CDC investigating small number cases myocarditis (inflamation heart muscle) observed vaccination mRNA vaccines looking available data. Linkage vaccine unclear.

See: equivalent European regulator same. Nuclear deterrence makes military action China unlikely undesirable. 

Also, CPC many many faults rational actors relatively risk averse. see reason intentionally release bioagent, especially soil.  Next comes law banning kids 18 getting vaccinated without parent present. also literally able get vaccine recently. op's take brutally stupid. Fosun manufactures BioNTech vaccines China. calling Chinese vaccines technically accurate saying Pfizer vaccines here.  CDC best statisticians. I‚Äôm inclined believe Ah yes, classic *unconditional surrender upon one condition met* trick Yes, spouting bunch nonsense makes look like serious one. 
 
Not single thing said *any relevance whatsoever* subject hand.  
 
Let's take one time. 
 
1. **Some states hard time using allocated doses.** regards vaccine waste, solved issue. States using weekly allocations receiving doses. anything, states using allocations non-residents skews metrics delay ability producers ship vaccines US. 
 
2. **The US AstraZeneca stockpile used.** completely unrelated anything discussed. I'm sure think Blackfeet tribe giving AstraZeneca doses Canadians, actually not. stockpile primarily built awaiting FDA validation. US committed [sending 80 million doses next Frankly sounds like work hard enough it. really like that.

No abided rules. want cut front people needed first me. YMMV. Michael R. Gordon, Warren P. Strobel Drew Hinshaw

WASHINGTON‚ÄîThree researchers China‚Äôs Wuhan Institute Virology became sick enough November 2019 sought hospital care, according previously undisclosed U.S. intelligence report could add weight growing calls fuller probe whether Covid-19 virus may escaped laboratory.
The details reporting go beyond State Department fact sheet, issued final days Trump administration, said several researchers lab, center study coronaviruses pathogens, became sick autumn 2019 ‚Äúwith symptoms consistent Covid-19 common seasonal illness.‚Äù


The disclosure number researchers, timing illnesses hospital visits come eve meeting World Health Organization‚Äôs decision-making body, expected discuss next phase investigation Covid-19‚Äôs origins.
Current former officials familiar intelligence lab researchers expressed differing views strength supporting evidence assessment. One person said provided international partner potentially significant still need investigation additional corroboration.


Another person described intelligence stronger. ‚ÄúThe information coming various sources exquisite quality. precise. didn‚Äôt tell exactly got sick,‚Äù said, referring researchers.


November 2019 roughly many epidemiologists virologists believe SARS-CoV-2, virus behind pandemic, first began circulating around central Chinese city Wuhan, Beijing says first confirmed case man fell ill Dec. 8, 2019.
The Wuhan Institute hasn‚Äôt shared raw data, safety logs lab records extensive work coronaviruses bats, many consider likely source virus.


China repeatedly denied virus escaped one labs. Sunday, China‚Äôs foreign ministry cited WHO-led team‚Äôs conclusion, visit Wuhan Institute Virology, WIV, February, lab leak extremely unlikely. ‚ÄúThe U.S. continues hype lab leak theory,‚Äù foreign ministry said response request comment Wall Street Journal. ‚ÄúIs actually concerned tracing source trying divert attention?‚Äù
The Biden administration declined comment intelligence said technically credible theories origin pandemic investigated international experts.


‚ÄúWe continue serious questions earliest days Covid-19 pandemic, including origins within People‚Äôs Republic China,‚Äù said spokeswoman National Security Council.


‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going make pronouncements prejudge ongoing study source SARS-CoV-2,‚Äù spokeswoman said. ‚ÄúAs matter policy never comment intelligence issues.‚Äù


Beijing also asserted virus could originated outside China, including lab Fort Detrick military base Maryland, called investigate early Covid outbreaks countries.


Most scientists say seen nothing corroborate idea virus came U.S. military lab, White House said credible reasons investigate it.
China‚Äôs National Health Commission WIV didn‚Äôt respond requests comment. Shi Zhengli, top bat coronavirus expert WIV, said virus didn‚Äôt leak laboratories. told WHO-led team traveled Wuhan earlier year investigate origins virus staff tested negative Covid-19 antibodies turnover staff coronavirus team.


Marion Koopmans, Dutch virologist team told NBC News March WIV staff fall sick autumn 2019, attributed regular, seasonal sickness.
‚ÄúThere occasional illnesses that‚Äôs normal. nothing stood out,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúMaybe one two. It‚Äôs certainly big, big thing.‚Äù


It isn‚Äôt unusual people China go straight hospital fall sick, either get better care lack access general practitioner. Covid-19 flu, different illnesses, share symptoms, fever, aches cough. Still, could significant members team working coronaviruses went hospital similar symptoms shortly pandemic first identified.


David Asher, former U.S. official led State Department task force origins virus then-Secretary State Mike Pompeo, told Hudson Institute seminar March doubted lab researchers became sick ordinary flu.


‚ÄúI‚Äôm doubtful three people highly protected circumstances level three laboratory working coronaviruses would get sick influenza put hospital severe conditions week, didn‚Äôt anything coronavirus,‚Äù said, adding researchers‚Äô illness may represent ‚Äúthe first known cluster‚Äù Covid-19 cases.


Long characterized skeptics conspiracy theory, hypothesis pandemic could begun lab accident attracted interest scientists complained lack transparency Chinese authorities conclusive proof alternate hypothesis: virus contracted humans bat infected animal outside lab.


Many proponents lab hypothesis say virus carried infected bat might brought lab researchers could work potential vaccines‚Äîonly escape.


While lab hypothesis taken seriously, including Biden administration officials, debate still colored political tensions, including much evidence needed sustain hypothesis.


The State Department fact sheet issued Trump administration, drew classified intelligence, said ‚ÄúU.S. government reason believe several researchers inside WIV became sick autumn 2019, first identified case outbreak, symptoms consistent Covid-19 seasonal illnesses.‚Äù


The Jan. 15 fact sheet added fact ‚Äúraises questions credibility‚Äù Dr. Shi criticized Beijing ‚Äúdeceit disinformation‚Äù acknowledging U.S. government hasn‚Äôt determined exactly pandemic began.


The Biden administration hasn‚Äôt disputed assertions fact sheet, current former officials say vetted U.S. intelligence agencies. fact sheet also covered research activities WIV, alleged cooperation projects Chinese military accidents Chinese labs.


But one Biden administration official said highlighting data pointed lab leak hypothesis, Trump administration officials sought ‚Äúto put spin ball.‚Äù Several U.S. officials described intelligence ‚Äúcircumstantial,‚Äù worthy exploration conclusive own.


Asked Jan. 15 statement, State Department spokesman Ned Price said: ‚ÄúA fact sheet issued previous administration January 15 draw conclusions regarding origins coronavirus. Rather, focused lack transparency surrounding origins.‚Äù
Though first known case Dec. 8, several analyses virus‚Äôs rate mutation concluded likely began spreading several weeks earlier.


The WHO-led team visited Wuhan concluded joint report Chinese experts March virus likely spread bats humans via another animal, laboratory leak ‚Äúextremely unlikely.‚Äù


However, team members said didn‚Äôt view raw data original lab, safety records. day report came out, chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said team hadn‚Äôt adequately examined lab leak hypothesis, called fuller probe idea.
The U.S., European Union several governments also called transparent investigation Covid-19‚Äôs origins, without explicitly demanding lab probe. called particular better access data samples potential early Covid-19 cases.


Members WHO-led team said Chinese counterparts identified 92 potential Covid-19 cases among 76,000 people fell sick October early December 2019, turned requests share raw data larger group. data would help WHO-led team understand China sought test 92 people antibodies.


Team members also said asked access Wuhan blood bank test samples December 2019 antibodies. Chinese authorities declined first, citing privacy concerns, agreed, yet provide access, team members say. wanted say awesome friend are. Willing take angry reactions save passing out. what? still bad look protocol covid? state vaccination guidelines follow. Typically wait 2 wks symptoms resolve. Vaccine side effects different everyone, yes slightly pronounced already covid. despise crypto-eugenics take three reasons: 1) implies people born ""stupid"" rather taught mistaught, 2) *he* might fine, 3) accept people stupid takes eliminated gene pool? That's rather totalitarian, no? already decided surrender unconditionally neither machine guns Molotov cocktails anyone. 

The municipal government trying *facilitate* amphibious landing. boat ferry need. strategic/tactical decision whether put effort building pier ferry. would unfortunate spend money either could gotten federal state money build pier federal state governments forget completely boat never shows up. Obviously HI stricter requirements most, really seems like time get program. even letting fully vaccinated people without negative test yet. stupid fucking cop out. told winterize grid decades, refused due greed. still get virus spread even vaccinated. risk severe complications death greatly reduced vaccinations appointments made online, set alarm five minutes go online. Use time pull website, create account, make sure right info, etc. Set alarm one minute before, way know it‚Äôs time. Then, stare time exactly time they‚Äôre set drop. Refresh immediately, try grab them. website crashes, keep trying absolutely way left (got pre order Xbox way, full 30 minutes drop). Also, make sure aren‚Äôt wifi you‚Äôre trying. slow internet down. Make sure you‚Äôre place plenty service. Good luck! hope get one! know month currently month stated title? Good grief. 30% unvaccinated adults bare minimum, 20% goal, 10% dream. Facebook vector misinformation now. Even vaccine stuff tons straight false political information around 2016 election. Literally paid ads too. Bruh, thing happened decade ago. research would help ignorance. sad. Repeat me: vaccines 100% effective. Go look 10 people.. they‚Äôre vaccinated one still gonna get Covid. way keep one getting Covid everyone get vaccinated Covid doesn‚Äôt exist anymore.

You don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre one ten... best bet stick around vaccinated people far less likely sick first place. Plain, simple Garak... headline state proud of??? example, Muhajarine pointed small East African island nation Seychelles least 60 per cent population fully vaccinated either Sinopharm AstraZeneca vaccines. 

Why using Seychelles example Canada could resurgence? That‚Äôs absurd. CSUs 50% in-person fall. still lot students taking all-online classes  amazing many anti-vaxxers announce right refuse vaccine fail accept employers right hire whoever want.

For idea, HEB beyond beloved grocery, pharmacy, bakery &amp; sundries chain based SA. Combo Loco free Vaxx! 
This weekend Longhorn graduation lots rural folks went get Vaxx town.  way Japan's unnecessary rigorous, vaccine approval history vaccine hesitancy. really need pick vaccination pace. believe so.  Unfortunalty, US. France Europe general. I've noticed mainly ignorance. study biology, see lot people really know vaccines works, immune system, think covid can't affect (yeah, always people). Even TV hosts got basics notions wrong. girl class wants become doctor keeps mask nose time, even surrounded people. infuriating. Even mother reluctant, managed convince her, explained worked way less dangerous get vaccinated getting come cheap, accessible reliable treatment even getting infected matter. 

I want pessimistic, companies absolutly take advantage pandemic. prices vaccines bottled oxygen decrease soon, even countries desesperatly need (India, Brazil...).

Stay safe too, good day/night ! Traditional cyber school available places. NY public option cyber school difficult rules anyone wants home school making cyber school burdensome costly process many. Fire her. big counties never counted active cases, including Los Angeles. LA 1.2 million cases alone. fully vaccinated time exposure showing COVID symptoms, CDC recommend testing. course, you. countries politicized response pandemic least degree? leave Hawaii holdout?

If knew 0% choice covid, wouldn‚Äôt interested vaccine. much research rather get vaccine greatly reduce chance covid

Unfortunately reality choosing two options studied long term, unless able avoid virus unvaccinated (like hermit) choice clear, own. Instead bribing people don‚Äôt want shots US maybe send elsewhere circle back unvaccinated later? Time new show Go look 10 people.. they‚Äôre vaccinated one still gonna get Covid.

Yeah, that's One common misunderstanding 95% efficacy means Pfizer clinical trial, 5% vaccinated people got COVID. that's true; actual percentage vaccinated people Pfizer (and Moderna) trials got COVID-19 hundred times less that: 0.04%. 95% actually means vaccinated people 95% lower risk getting COVID-19 compared control group participants, vaccinated. words, vaccinated people Pfizer clinical trial 20 times less likely control group get COVID-19.

I agree. followed bunch epidemiologists Twitter surprising see much personal bickering arguing happening, sometimes pretty childish.

There coherent message petty infighting pretty much lowered trust opinions. Texas‚Äô estimated 1.7 million adolescents, endured isolation virtual-learning challenges year.

That's true. urban counties remote learning. Thousands kids attending school since 9/2020.  Yes, reported per capita cases lower countries probably also infrastructure (eg.

Curiosity good reason get medically tested. According CDC Dr. Fauci, perfectly fine. However, immunocompromised there's chance vaccines protect you.
