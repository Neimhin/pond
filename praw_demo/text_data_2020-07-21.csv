That's great psychologists researchers know that, public consuming watered research not, vastly change power result study different interpretations. Whether agree not, one issues Psychology faces relating credibility field. Although survey data may recognized confounding variable, see well controlled compared actual observations increase validity many studies? significant confounding variables controlled for, still science? science, affect credibility claims extracted data? 

It seem like Dark Triad personality traits significant research behind them, I'll look bit further. I've always bit skeptical personality research, I'm sure there's credible Appreciate discussion bringing bit back Earth. seems like good intentions I’m sick sick shit.

Why ignoring seven day moving average?

Either explain dont understand stop trolling. Hey pay 10 bucks hour go concert I'll go. Hah!

Apparently actual Quarantine Act little bit nuance RCMP hand-out states.

Quarantine Act. (Conforming 1 Million 3 Years) Masks don’t work. Stop propaganda UN council, always votes Israel’s settlements, one against. That’s one time Obama abstained voting unanimous vote Israel.

So Israel providing free testing plan annex large part West Bank? Please, learn think. kick Palestinians homes land grab - don’t think give flying fuck testing successfully messaging away deaths, like scrubbing away atrocities holocaust.  States highest number deaths per million last week:

She also slight weird amount cranberry juice guess we’ll safe UTIs too. guess never played plague inc. True main point study, bit sensationalized. article also said:

“But new research indicates health beliefs situational perceptions may play important role personality traits alone.” kidding. Try telling that. Normal stuff. guy said 99.99999 percent harmless. Thanks reference. actually cited another discussion reading, copied interesting study consider follow-up: [667 1216 (55%) COVID-19 patients abnormal cardiogram indicator pathology significant long-term (98/215) patients mild symptoms abnormal (210/327) patients moderate symptoms abnormal authors list asymptomatic presentations, probably sample made hospitalized patients. One potential confounding factor sample made patients cardiograms performed; know many reporting clinicians issue cardiograms standard course care patients COVID-19, imagine pool patients cardiograms taken might overrepresent patients likely cardiac pathology. cardiac disease reported 26% patients"", interesting two respects: 1) many readings prompted either standard course care suspicion pathology, rather consideration patient's preexisting conditions, 2) significant proportion individuals without pre-existing cardiac disease abnormal cardiograms often unheralded severe,"" indicating silent pathology may go unrecognized clinicians. mean yeah shitty experiences sometimes, what's point? happen anywhere. Yeah, person got March isn’t going right lol

I know people still dealing month, that’s norm. 

Where’s graph mentioned? I'm aware massive successful containment effort made easier SARS contagious later sickness, severity imoblizing host. 

But also greatly aided deleterious nature RNA viruses coming play SARS quickly mutated far less contagious disease.

We (as humans) got lucky SARS overall. Yes, also good job combating it, things went well could (minus squashed right away).  ""Trying""? I'm gonna bet Gallbladder Appendix odd ones here.... Thats plan Welcome aboard USS Page, numbfuck. Better late never. strap life jacket sit ass captain gets us this.  American go court pandemic Models say..fucking everything. We've saved lives, we're killing people. dependent happens daily, weekly, monthly. emotions say stats say thousands lives mattered. Stats mean nothing know many aholes daily basis care they're infecting whomever around town. know full enormity we've done over. 70 yo's would've lived 90. 20 's would've lived 80. Data statistics observed bent lied till we're blue face realize people hospitalized dying faster pace flu joint scenrio could give us..especially given lengthts we've gone mediate risk. Can't low poll numbers stop taking polls. understanding. 140k died several months. I'm saying happened faster, deaths would avoided.

But hit hard fast enough, track another 100k dead, probably more. People still perceive threat big enough, is... Critical business. Something's solved person.

Civil Rights Movement (1954-1968) - Boomers children young adults point. like today, protests full young people looking change. forget members worshiped ""Greatest Generation"" ones opposing change.

Vietnam War (1965-1975 US involvement) - Boomers ranging teens 30's actively protesting war.

Let's also forget tech leaders generation responsible much electronics today.

On whole, whenever faced choice immediate gains versus long-term rewards, generation always chose immediate gains cost future generations, I'm definitely calling generation ""good"", also can't write entire age bracket due choices some. I'm writing every Zoomer ate Tide Pods.

Our generation, Millenials Zoomers (most reddit falls one two), opposing negative legacies boomers, like Greatest Generation.

Rare see Singapore data posted here. ""Herd immunity eradication unless occurs globally, herd immunity refers specific populations, whole planet.""

Great, close every border every country we're place right? like people travel anything. 

Ffs. numbers “fall” Trump take full credit start right finally urges people wear masks. honestly reason even within liberal free society, natural disaster threatens survival everyone, entirely legitimate proper temporarily suspend freedom save lives.

It precisely circumstance rationale forcing evacuation sinking ship, barring - force necessary - access forming volcano large deadly chemical spill. exactly reasoning goes snatching child fully run straight traffic crushing wheels fast-moving bus.

Freedom useless dead.

And person smart, people, whole, mostly stupid. 

I conclude times freedoms must suspended protect existence freedom first place: short, absolutism self-destroying. coronavirus went 0.1% IFR 800 years ago got eradicated, would medical journal. Got it. Thanks insight. ordering takeaway food? Thanks encouraging comment kid. PARENTS took doctor, dentist, etc. School lice checks kid. Wow - statewide mask orders work? Hello Florida!!!!! Hopefully far left learned powerful lesson turning results back 2016.

The system going change. menu sucks, options menu R.

The amount strife occurred changes unfathomable. variability kind point epidemiology. person person basis comparison meaningless. However look massive population individuals variability shows meaningful patterns. Would people living recieve large infectious doses, absolutely. Would people households get smaller doses? Sure.

But compared distribution think would hard argue average person living would receive infection dose close someone full household. Wtf wrong YOU? don’t magically disappear reminds investors owners need take care shit could lose it. 

It means companies need reduce dividends increase equity. means companies stop stock buybacks shore balance sheets. means end 30 year debt essentially 0%....why? sudden risk loss can’t whatever want fine actually make smart decisions. 

It means new business buy assets inflated value. means new businesses spring industries learning lessons failures them. true, using research sars1 outbreak assist rapid development one. Sars1 squashed never bothered finishing it. want suspend freedom choice, due crisis.

Obviously us disagree nature crisis.

You would like suspend freedom disagree too, apparently. Even link total, 16,400 Floridians hospitalized due COVID-19

They daily total hospitalizations due covid. total currently hospitalized. Yes is, “the sky falling, give us money!” faith mate. government ruled unelected bureauocrate can't even follow rules helped create. 

I feel hit worst case scenario though. happily surprised rapidly Leicester locked down. reinvest anywhere military. works too. bad know two people got one confirmed. Really depends know. I’m sure people know like 30 people got it. Yeah, I'm fine. example seemed /r/suspiciouslyspecific all.

Edit cause dont spell good Another outbreak coming 4.. 3.. 2.. wait dont stay home order right now? thought one since March? anyways back Overwatch can’t busy trying sell bullshit Google it, it’s sub billion times. Nobody needs spoon feed you.   dEath RaTeS GoInG gUyS!!!!!!! Good points. would think doctors office would low terms transmission chances though, least kinds visits talking about. Urgent care would bigger issue. think vaccines less effective elderly populations though, less likely go beyond doctors visits. I’m also suggesting elderly people aren’t important, whole good prioritize working population would able go work help restart economy. also likely vaccine work effectively. think bring good concerns though, it’s cut dry. Yeah, people fruitcakes. do, vaccine creates temporary permanent immunity disease, even covid vaccine grants temporary immunity would less end coronavirus pandemic scale. means, Japan China density Canada, they'd like 2 cases. antibodies undetectable using current antibody tests certain amount time? undetected still protection? Kindly please advise. front page fox news guess got mention proves US incredibly susceptible bio attacks national defense perspective.

Politics aside, likely fair amount immigrants seeking medical care border county lack adequate care side border. “The China virus” says matter. need stay message least week penetrate base get stop fighting war PPE. Smile wave congratulate protecting country.   Exactly! People get disease children immune, usually epidemic form cycle every *x* years critical mass non-immune children builds up, population spared disease new critical mass forms disease circulates populations. We're using actual definition herd immunity, using definition made herd immunity global near-eradication disease. simply herd immunity is. pointing measles still exists invalidates concept herd immunity observed natural part measles epidemic cycles since 1930s.

I studied epidemiology work herpesviruses, also exhibit herd immunity effect. Y'all idea talking about. Herd immunity *is eradication* unless occurs globally, herd immunity refers specific populations (a town, state, community, etc), whole planet.

I'll quote Wikipedia make certain threshold reached, herd immunity gradually eliminates disease population.[5] elimination, achieved worldwide, may result permanent reduction number infections zero, called eradication.[6] Herd immunity created via vaccination contributed eventual eradication smallpox 1977 contributed reduction frequencies diseases.[7] Herd immunity apply diseases, contagious, meaning transmitted one individual another.[5] Tetanus, example, infectious contagious, herd immunity Herd immunity recognized naturally occurring phenomenon 1930s observed significant number children become immune measles, number new infections temporarily decreased, including among susceptible children.[8] Mass vaccination induce herd immunity since become common proved successful preventing spread many infectious diseases.[9] India apparently focusing live attenuated virus vaccine. works would work even better inactivated virus vaccine. difficult nut crack. Governor 1 week away achieving *presumed goal* Florida cases United states 70K behind NY. Japan I'm even surprise end handwritten document faxed. Good thing spend tax money bunch Brads play dress desert, military useless president. Didn’t know, Trump Dr Google tight slow one downplaying deaths Texas bub. Testing bottlenecked big time. Residents Arizona Florida wait weeks results... California grandmother wait whole week even swabbed. flooding system, pay attention hospitalizations deaths, even tweaked politicians.  Well, case, mean voter voted reality TV personality even lower intelligence guy voted for?

That sad. case, happen next election? I'm Wisconsin parent schools let March switched online platform reading math teachers could assign game-style lessons based student's progress.

They shared resources gym music art sent home recommended practice materials like reading booklets, worksheets, flash cards, etc. 

This fall, district planning hybrid schooling grades 6 k-5 expected attend school 5 days week full time. Thankfully, allowing parents continue virtual schooling prefer much prefer. feel teachers. ‘MURICA!!!! term “herd immunity” comes pre-vaccine measles outbreaks:


“Herd immunity recognized naturally occurring phenomenon 1930s observed significant number children become immune measles, number new infections temporarily decreased, including among susceptible children.” L.O.L. seen hours later fundraiser wearing mask??? Basically usually find someone tell happy story via polls. suspect finally reached point one credible could engineer poll resulted happy story. oh, also donating 1 million Euros help environment, okay. don’t think understand reality vaccine.

Edit: nevermind , saw you’re anti masker lol Says consider every child catching something age 15 herd immunity? believe there’s hacking going state media spinning news nothing?  I’ve actually always thought way ever end MIC. problem much GDP employs many people, cut spending, you’d terrible, albeit short lived recession. Big healthcare would take graft MIC corporate overlords would still happy. Thank updates. data roughly percentage asymptotic carriers becomes symptomatic later percentage remains asymptomatic case resolves? Problem incumbents likely voted back people want stick whatever know, even bad. possibly good time reminding people Trump's complete insanity incoherent awfulness, rather hiding it. virus participated European tour group,also bought business class ticket.

Chinese people can't join European tour group? Even take away political, cartel inequality landscape away have, I'm mistaken, highest rate diabetes world. Must playing part. Along Peru, Chile Colombia feel Mexico one forgotten epicenters world. news. would expect state large population many cases. escalating, time spread across many places country. lost window National Lockdown since economy literally collapse so. 

This fucking jagged pill. literally forced watch Americans die couldn’t come together act unified country common enemy. 

Those think still lock country to, understand emotional plea moral dilemma. fiscally literally ruination even try to. areas suffering shut rest country low community spread needs simply watch horror go far normal lives. 

I’m sorry way. absolutely terrible. Zinc coating throat. situations can't socially distance. May ask thoughts this? Lol I’m racist what? Calling virus originated from??

It China’s negligence policy (or lack thereof) resulted outbreak. Wet markets disaster far this, done almost nothing stop happening again.

The world tired bullshit. agree you, think parents want return children school bad parents people, mandate school closures unless willing take COVID-19 seriously *make implement plan keep teachers staff safe*. Right absolutely zero chance happens, shame. come number? horrible reference. obviously people higher risk contraction they're environment necessitate masks/distancing. wish someone would kill article. word “new” makes sound like today  know mean mistakes made humanity whole. many us control lives, sucks see people power fuck majorly rest us.

All I've learned far shit's painful faith humanity high. like idea UV light air flows. 

But design issue, including inlet outlet positions, relative flow rates inlet outlet. 9 states higher nursing home death rates NY. seems mostly old people protecting better hospitals saving people. deaths going continue rise mid-August according YYG model spot entire time. Stonks going up. That’s admin cares about. would think young people COVID would result older people COVID. Unless everyone ignoring parents/grandparents past 3 months.  That's really tricky going get much back citizens cut wet markets. likely like last time. Things stop, slightly stringent rules put place everyone forgets, something come back bite ass.

It happen again. needs looked securing effective immediately pandemic readiness program cannot changed small group people agenda focused protecting general public.

You cut money many things, comes safety. didnt want that! want 10% going education.  boyfriend considered elderly needs vaccine I’m elderly we’re dating. think start blaming virus, since masses people getting sick would *also* impacted economy. mention health “infrastructure”. winter break schools week Sweden. Stockholm end February. lot families went skiing home countries. Countries like Italy, Austria, Iran on. hundreds swedes Covid-19 long anyone even thought lockdown. even Sweden gone lockdown time Norway best case scenario still way worse. That's true... Though bigger part others wearing masks... 

Also... chances winning lottery absolutely insane... flu vaccine? always one strain, influenza mutates every year. always one vaccine. think possible vaccinated strains. Let's say spend $50-100 situation purchase ten masks. Assuming staying isolated, many trips public need make long trips last? Two 1-hour trips week? that's case ten ""one-time-use"" masks would last nine months accumulating 8 hours used time mask. rotating leaving closet week sufficient kill virus.

Obviously larger problems intend go back work need wear masks day similar situations but, agree, solution lack N95 masks now. honestly thought would one first things worked started shutdowns.

These cloth masks, appreciate them, joke environment everybody wants wear mask. need able acquire PERSONAL protective equipment. best way handle refuse follow public health guidelines.

If take seriously asked simple things, get money pay cost petulance?

This classic ""Little Red Hen"" children's story lesson. help plant wheat, help harvest, help grind flour, help bake.....but hungry want slice bread? According official reports... exactly CIA Tuskegee, AL(fake vaccines)? citizens. still risked life. keep thinking might lead another stimulus, even UBI, alas Seem believe money wasted government. real dissagrement us dont believe ever correctly, rather give any.

Politicians cannot corrupted power.  Thanks others stated completely taken context. Say me, F*UCK CHINA ""An orphan child whose parents died, unknown, permanently abandoned them. common usage, child lost parents due death called orphan. also tell context talking 2 parents killed. saying again? general idiot? 45k cases now. Oh guy intentionally set fire Rain Forest effort expansion? Mother Nature beautiful being, not? reopened office two weeks ago told everyone could work home work office. Zero pressure either way. two employees back office every day. two working home fine.

From water cooler rumblings, sounds like home family 24/7 quite panacea everyone would like be. Lol We're going see truly heartbreaking stuff month schools open. Kinda off-topic, guys think establishments ""require"" masks, allow children wear one long parents do? told gf stubbornly went restarant get hell there. “theyre spaced
 though” wear mask indoors.......

damn establishments man.....

i hope ribeye steak worth \*sigh\*  gonna lend Trump justification test. Rate mutation fast.

Your memory cells likely would able respond well strain years later. expert said new mutation Covid-19 helping outbreaks spread faster around Nick Loman, University Birmingham, also part Covid-19 Genomics Consortium, said new strand, known D614G, become dominant across Scotland, deputy first minister John Swinney said “something gone badly wrong” test trace facility Motherwell 19 people tested positive Covid-19, including 14 staff members five people “connected” centre.

here Unfortunately lot people think people deserve death. See, kids fine. go back school. /s Lol... arguing validity article read opinion twisting lazy actually read.

This become entertaining foreign agent trying destabilize US, would sit watch, eating popcorn. Almost numbers explanations see media political leaders based CFR i.e. case fatality rate.

But varies wildly based much testing done. testing, cases get people sick enough go doctor hospital, hospitalization fatality rate high.

But widespread testing, especially randomized testing, find lots cases people sick sick all. finding 10 times many cases public counted. easy drive case hospitalization fatality rate simply finding cases people sick.

The hospitalization rate Arizona gone 25% beginning May 5% today, guessing why.

This kind thing think understood reported. People look number cases whole story.

Edit: eventually estimated 20% world's population exposed Swine Flu. sure actually determined give billions tests. estimate. point, estimate based statistical analysis. BTW see reason believe virus widespread. correlate much stupider residents are? think strong link. see crowded outdoor bars, crowded beaches, crowded restaurants, etc. seems highly unlikely. 
Heat humidity slows spread outdoors. within 1 ft away other, it’d chaos. aiding spread California hot dry. Arizona hot dry, too. It’s human behavior even virus wants touch charcoal lungs. course I’m angry course want feel bad. COVID-19 affected personal level many different ways, I’m calling bullshit. Otherwise, you’d continue spread misinformation ignorance.

Your arguments terrible. Korean, confirm weren’t quick curbing curve, would suffered much worse economic fallout (aka suicides unemployment).

The entire world tired virus. one excited it. want over, quickly. Denying seriousness total wanker prolong problem, bet fuckers like would advocate mandatory vaccination, too. he's willing fake one test, he's willing fake three sell bit. Faking first one really point return. roommate fucking respiratory therapist states designated COVID hospital didnt even self isolate sent home work fever ""it felt like flu"" him. noped fuck house laying low GF. wanna partisan feels like self overestimation/obtuseness republican trait. Oh god. human adenovirus like half population anti-vector antibodies. smart. mean it’s hard teach complex math without something basic polynomials go LA masked. Blame idiots Orange County. point though recommending might fuck point return terms reelection chances. mean wasn’t going get re-elected either way definitely not. anti maskers going turn “betrayed” them. Something adding up. OP's article, phase 1, says 2.8% acquired virus (% antibodies + % active infections). calculation phase 2 results 2.1% state acquired virus. would expect number gone higher 2.8%... response question knew talking about. would able say ""Yes, here's why..."" showing us source. Source PA comment?

I know cases going testing still going up. I'm pretty sure % infection staying steady around 5% This.

Seem like fear mongering ignorant see articles antibodies disapeering months.

Anyone knows anything immunity knows information irrelevant.

The 2 factors affect long term immunity bodies ability replicate immune response(memory cells like said) rate virus mutates. internet amplifies small extremes. fuckin' way almost half people turn immunity. Probably closer 20% fewer, we're pulling numbers butts. everyone needs one Pretty fancy pen got Doug. much cost Taxpayers? Wait force open schools. aint see nothing yet! called CCP ?? shit?? pointless fucking articles sister law fine, night passed started coughing slightly... Exactly. Wasnt like entire month Boris Johnson finally hospitalized? turned weeks ICU believe, may wrong Six times still high. wearing mask may lower viral load, may help....so thats im doing. article annoying (popups) would cut &amp; paste designation strain Dsomething. can't recall ""european"" strain not. No, doesn't, though might like alternatives.

I'm interested 30,000 participant study they're recruiting for. hopeful goes well. Is...there kind? Everyone wants hire male nurse. Nurses tend female male nurse places want you.  rename thread Daily whining, bitching complaing thread? non-zoonotic disease

Yea, lot people seem missing. Even vaccinating everyone world mean eradicated still infect humans animals.

But, practical purposes, effective vaccine better understanding make similar swine bird flus outbreaks disrupt overall life. insult monkeys please California woman taking Florida Man spot news? understand you’re saying agree somewhat- however woman lives household 16 people (5 adults, 11 children) really think afford miss work? know seems really selfish, everyone afford that. MANY Americans, it’s either stay home lose job, home, starve go work. Maybe mom luxury able get paid leave job, isn’t reality everyone. know lost job, fiancé would homeless- income would enough. I’m considered lucky teacher working moment.

Other countries paying people stay home US, told “if don’t come work, you’ll fired.” Companies aren’t taking virus seriously all. want blame poor people misfortune outbreak jobs?

Maybe think wish whole lot underpaid people “rot hell bottom heart.” paying useless elementary “studies”. Everyone already knows this. something useful god damn money. NOW. Going forward make sure funding actually goes helping Americans. Enough.  I'm following. defending California blasting neo-liberal? CA highest marginal income tax country 12.3%. There's additional 1% income $1million funds mental health services. appears progressive income tax country. high big earners, that's everything America. WA even income tax. state earn tax revenue progressive manner? Yeah, knew idiots back NE, shit got serious, like major hurricane coming in, tended drop BS serious. Here, idiots likely double stupid get hammered failed duck. due virus, due government

I'm sorry what? countries hard lock-downs already recovering.

Americas half-hearted freedom-loving approach fucked us next 5 years. let Hong Kong test flight crew boating Alaska, swear! Ahh eye eye. ancient wisdom still applies today. /s needed tubes tied long 11th idea accurate is. point current argument comparing income income using currency conversion accurately capture wealth disparity. else explain despite median earnings almost 100% higher US median wealth UK 50% greater? Picture maskless, asymptomatic covid carriers winding common cold. Even without covid causing symptoms, they’ll cough sneeze everywhere. course variables general math works 8 per billion talking entire population, going happen often unless massively significant variable. I'm sorry taught poorly university.

And top that, numbers based New York drastically overwhelmed. discovered manage properly. outcomes drastically improved. used best numbers incident total population have. IFR likely far better now.  Give bats.  approach might work children, grown ass adults spend day watching OAN. people beyond help need forced wear mask. amount empathy leveled approaches help them. selfish.

These also people i'm talking about, page here. I'm talking people anxiety want safe feel suffocating mask. life, real allow wear face shield already option, choosing ignore it.

ok probably started here...this entire point thread lol. said allow people can't wear mask medical reasons anxiety wear face shields met resistence.

So would appear entire conversation people refusing wear mask, agreeance people simply refuse wear pretend anxiety mask go hell. people legit feeling suffocation mask allowed wear face shield. Link proof? Post evidence, let's see have. 

You first. made opening claim, proof vitamins, specifically quantity, shown help harm? Prop 13 ppl buying 2nd homes rent also get alpha beta thing going on... remember correctly proven untrue unable get bed keep food 2 months? like since 10th March Italy. 20 day first case covid discovered, way worst days crisis. like know happened New York too. course, US everything harder. Expecially want it. going appeal science, least demonstrate understand it. None said confirmed, majority research right COVID-19 open scrutiny due ambulance chasing. Every group rushing first publish groundbreaking work, nearly groups sacrificing accuracy findings speed publication. 

To wit: literally viruses known exist rate reinfection rate antibody failure. They're vanishingly small rates. known virus today significant reinfection rate (i.e. antibody failure). studies far reinfection rates covid-19 plagued inaccurate antibody tests give false positives embarrassingly high rates. 

There ""pharma conspiracy"" here. rather impressive speed researched, honestly. definitely cash grab since **vaccinations would distributed population free**. probably one top ten environmentally damaging achievements well. fucking way isn’t joke   folks objected work provided healthcare covering birth control work requiring vaccine. know could incredibly high number.

&amp;#x200B;

If people would wear fucking masks social distance, maybe we'll never find sure. would ideal. don’t want die, wouldn’t sad die either likely much widespread testing, includes younger people. Previously cases counted primarily sick generally older.

The virus also far less serious younger people. Simply virus necessarily mean sick, go hospital, die. without schools open. Imagine schools open. sad. combination lead, lack environmental protection, associating conventionally intelligent democrats therefore bad...um...what else...intentionally terrible horrifically stratified education based socioeconomic status, belief economy scarcity therefore hate anyone different they're going take have, believing we're superior rest world SPEAK GA LISH stupid...rampant diabetes rotting people's brains...being ugly, fat, much show growing ""greatest country"" world nothing show = rampant denial, tv shows, social media, movies, fake news brainwashing people stupidity...

I happily sell American citizenship vanish Sealand, Canada, basically almost anywhere else. Fuck people. Quarantine hotels, preferably inside doorknobs removed quarantine rooms. Hey man, atleast happend. sources show many people survive Covid lasting health issues? country instituted steep fines prison sentences exactly dipshits like this. harsh punishment, live harsh times. Ppl pursue criminal case her. knowingly putting folks danger. believe charges pressed ppl HIV didn’t tell anyone precedent  way much trust average American. 100% Carlson Hannity hardcore right wing nutters appeal to. see ever bailing Trump. Rumors Carlson running potus 24 imagine it, would want get Trump vote win nom. anti mask movement started recently, people wore masks problem People living top tiny house seems predictor spread call Theraflu ""Share-a-flu"".

Even jobs generous sick leave, I've seen Americans come work sick like soul line.

Visibleconfusion.jpg work told take place line wait week so? Elephant room: cost ill America. either incredibly selfish incredibly skint. both. PA, feel like Governer Wolf good possibly do. bunch people riled attended Black Lives Matter protest wearing mask kind annoying violate guideline, something felt necessary show solidarity. know anything person’s particular situation, really inequality issue kids afford? Sample size small.  Er,  There's likely capacity...most advanced medical centers enough capacity single digit number patients ECMO hospitals even ability ECMO (which lady would transferred).

Lots super sick relatively health people already machines. making pretty huge assumption folks machines deserving.

Do think kick young father ECMO her? ridiculous think people denying ECMO they're evil bastards, reality there's many ECMO machines they're taken they're taken. would thought?! exercise meal? Listen him. knows he’s taking /s unlikely even full shit would guess used inactivated vaccine. Grocery stores still flooded customers, experts say it’s time large chains go “dark” public convert curbside pickup home delivery food essential goods.

Works me, lets it! problem see tried curbside pickup beginning year told week waiting period. way buy groceries maybe would work lot better. March. assume everyone it. 

The flu similar. People bedridden feel ok mild nausea.  starters, would require admitting there's problem, something governors worst affected states trying hardest pretend case. 4-5 kids many. normal family size growing Europe 60s-70s.  Yeah, read article. recognize life kind survive. 

I, however, problem communicating diagnosis members household, including 11 children. cards life dealt make thoughtlessness suddenly go away. problem every state own.

What happened ""**United stand, divided fall**"" Masks+HEPA Filters recriculating system keep airplanes quite safe, I'm surprised documented superspreading cases airplanes I’m assuming fired sued. Imagine much worse hoarding would likely gotten grocery shopping actually restricted. Yeah, quite high coast, 88-89 summer days.  day see America turning like Brazil Brazil turning poor nazi Germany. There's 5 adults house. article state kids house hers.

But right. system forces chose earning enough money eat getting people ill incredibly fucked system needs changed. \*What viruses ?**
Virus ""genetic codes"" meant produce hijacking healthy cell, unlike others cannot themselvesWhat mean virus ?once infected cell already start producing ad disease already started.

**How body detect ?**
The body uses Pattern recognition receptors (Mainly called PRR) first, detect molecules shared pathogens belong body (because rare mutation , may live long)Most Pathogens stopped way cause inflammatory response.it noted MANY allergies caused PRR defect.

**What Body detected ?**
It creates inflammation increases volume blood locally (Vasodilatation),it also draws white blood cells producing chemicals.the ones interested Natural Killer cells (NK Cells AKA LGL)and Phagocyte.

NK Cells specialized releasing toxin meant kill virus-infected cellsand phagocyte eat remains vomit left explode itsome distinguish harmful object dont (they eat everything area.)it's bit complex phagocyte kill cells themselves, case viruses, don't.

What important body kill infected cells.

**If body immune system take account infectiosity ?**

it's simple, Remember PRR ? detect molecules, themwhich work,in case HIV, trigger PRR, also infect WHITE BLOOD CELLS MEANT STOP IT.Quite smart one agree ?

For coronavirus Sars-cov2, idea kind cells specializes in, probably lungs (most virus , since hijack kind cell, create problem regarding kind cells infect.)

Without PRR immune system useless invaded body therefore like existant.So need taken account.

Anyways , thanks advice using reddit makdown, i'll make sure miss next time. Yes , simply set viral load 0 every time person unaffected extend model. 

That model gives chances specific individual sick given circumstances. 
But extend actually , take model individual.

For person Chances sick 


let's call 
Pk(S) Probability (P) individual (k) sick (S) 


You'would actually (if want simplify it):

Pk(s) = 1-(1-T0)\\\*P0(s)\\\**(1-T1)\\\*P1(S)\\\**(1-T2)\\\*P2(S)... 


If want simplify simply replace Pn(s) local proportion sick individuals (or vaguely close one), looses predictive ability then.

Now estimate progression population ? 


For individual (yeah that's lot) 
you actually equation. 
it's ton calculation, least something puny computer handle easily, o(x!) calculation time. 


Now answer several questions : 


**"" would seem say almost guaranteed get virus come contact carrier receive large viral load ""** 
It Highly depends virus, yes, always certain moment almost guaranteed catch it. 
But talking small viruses pathogens 
I took HIV example mean transmission varies lot. 


For instance , 92.5% chance getting aid transfusion, 
there 0.11% chance getting insertive sexual relationship. 
But 2 causes : 


1- viral/pathogen load inferior (it's often case) 
i specifically took blood transfusion better way handling virus environment supposed in. 
but penetration certainly much ""blood"" going through. (at least 1 liter) 


2- mean alter pathogen  
Not pathogens equals, get destroyed UV.... actually do. 
But transmission occur, mean may alter pathogen point becomes less effective, keeping possibility pathogen stays alive. 


These makes becomes dependant way interact people. 


**""and similarly come contact large number carriers receive smaller load ""** 


this one actually frequent one yes, think could take individual pathogen calculate chances, likeliness sick correlated lot total viral load received (but proportional since depends way got pathogen). conclusion would minimize viral load receive wearing mask distancing, minimize number carriers come contact with. ""** 


Yes that's actually bounces, less pathogens meet better. 
i think love th way Dr Raoult said : 
""Managing pandemic 10\~20% medical expertise 80\~90% politics"" 


there ways 100% protect anyone , reduces chances taking measures. 
But one day stumble upon virus care way dealing (for instance fungus whose spore could get even live skin) 
We would actually , maybe go instinct. 


What makes pathogen dangerous : likely spread  much spread itself. 


most dangerous viruses 100% mortality rate 
because means killing potential ""spreader"" 
But efficient enough approach 95% 
And eradicate human , rather let remaining 5% non functioning society kill themselves. think assumption made I'm unsure truth of, additional virus particle independent static chance becoming source infection.""** 


Yes Actually made assumption individual untrained immune system particle new body. average response 
Some individual might +.5°C average body temperature might enough kill pathogens, impossible statistically properly would suspect might independent immune systems response, since immune system destroying one pathogen probably means cells destroying pathogens time. would assume would cause individual pathogens increase odds pathogen successfully cause infection. ""** 


So human immune system greatest, depending pathogen , multiple response occur. 
you way telling cell likely get infected, chances set ""equal independent"" 


the adaptative response kick need detect problem first adapt it. 


So left **innate immune system** always efficient, 
Because works completely differently bacterias, fungi parasites 
I focus viruses : would matter fox news still cover literally anything says fans lap lies Bingo Go directly jail, pass go, collect COVID bailout money. Nope, right. Keep opening up, USA. huge hoax right. stay are. March 1, 2020, April 25, 2020, total 505 059 deaths reported US; 87 001 (95% CI, 86 578-87 423) excess deaths, 56 246 (65%) attributed COVID-19. 14 states, 50% excess deaths attributed underlying causes COVID-19; included California (55% excess deaths) Texas (64% excess deaths) 5 states COVID-19 deaths experienced large proportional increases deaths nonrespiratory underlying causes, including diabetes (96%), heart diseases (89%), Alzheimer disease (64%), cerebrovascular diseases (35%) New York City experienced largest increases nonrespiratory deaths, notably heart disease (398%) diabetes (356%). California, encourage this. ""Spread"" defined ""spread far enough businesses start locking down"". Na got 11 assets sell. Easily get many thousands selling them. Oh, that's people vote alright. Come South Georgia behold biblically deep Republican party ties run churches. 

Then feel free observe moment hypocritical cherry-picking religious teachings values bible people jump hoops justify shitty lifestyle choices ignorance ""eyes God"". 

Separation church state supposedly thing, I'm sure go back there's strong correlation lot presidents systemically harmful democratic process, country whole, oppression citizens within heavy pandering certain religious sects. redneckery truly knows bounds.  point this? jerk thought COVID huge hoax? Class sizes become much smaller accomodate. Lectures fully online, labs smaller class size. 

Classes masks mandatory. unlikely, though impossible, students around get it, given adequate spacing mask usage.

As Purdue student, I’m actually worried classes. real kicker happens starts spread dorm common areas//apartment complexes share lots facilities like washer dryer. pivot though, last ~~about week~~ fox news viewer complaining masks.

FTFY California probably Consuela. That's one US's biggest problems  new flu shot new strain virus. Favorite substitution: $7 ground beef $14 steak. get steak often due price, diet, ethical concerns maddening. Got car, went store, got damn steak. last time shopping person.  coronavirus tests takes 13 days like pregnancy test takes 9 months. NZ hard fast lockdown. virus eradicated country indefinitely closed border, economists claiming country two weeks away emerging recession despite hard sharp hit GDP. Really? Wow, insightful. us probably neither, case stick vote third party literally care enough spoonfeed you. Look up, go hug strangers find first hand yourself. think learn NYC NYC quite exceptional far American cities towns go. highest population density metropolitan center US far hit hard tail end ""flu season"".

Too many people rationalizing relative safety communities saying, ""This NYC. numbers here"" ""It's hot here. heat kills virus"".

If pandemic decimated middle America suburb April hard NYC, think would served effective cautionary tale. Ya say bingo. feel people reasonably one two children judged long best provide them. 

If parents bringing 5, 7, 10+ kids world still poverty, indicative poor decision making poor decisions negatively impacting kids. 

People entitled procreating much others entitled judging so. virus spread US back beginning March.

January... Go lick doorknobs then, pal. give sweet fuck believe not. I'm Canada, take plague-ridden country stay there. /r/COVID19positive/

You see story over. Australia there’s $10,000 fine break mandated isolation. RIGHT?!?! legit cannot live anyone besides gf anymore. past 12 years like...15 different roommates. learned one thing, *hate* living people. ruins friendships, awkward, everyone sucks ways realize, including yourself. know hell living many people house *at one time*. mean even pre-pandemic emigrating basically never option except already ""won"" game home country given hard emigrate *AND* get money safely so. Lol think that's part issue. I've focusing much get mentally exhausted projects general dad duties, reading news tops sour cherry. 

Maybe need change hobby watch Molang daughter (that shit's adorable can't even) Also unclear degree risk mitigated lessened scenarios wear mask keep distant. unbelievable. 

I know right? Yet are. :(  grocery this, set foot inside store months. place order online pick next day, store gives time pick up, drive parking lot, call get there. Everything handed customer outside, parties wearing masks tests carried arrive Purdue, get results prior arriving. test positive, must pay extra Purdue quarantine you. Someone really liked cheaper dozen came out. I’m religious would vastly prefer authentic honest atheist president pretend stuff politicians Wtf. got test results work following day. impossible make use test takes long. going either staying home, risk exposing people regardless whether get tested Americans ever shutdown, instead anything, situation Poverty. Global Times editor-in-chief denies blocking US diplomats entering Wuhan Weibo

Says ""The State Department released information done protect American intellectual property private information Americans."" virus destroys cells? Cause would pretty handy EU (I think whole, least UK) MINIMUM 28 days full pay sick leave, companies offer lot year. dad sick 6 months full pay, 12 months half, pay that. dad used something like 4-5 months sick mum terminally ill. people afford *one* month US. found guy roughly 30 years. Super cool live place “nuh uh” good 15 people saying “no seriously, she’s completely ignoring rules.”

Wouldn’t something could like.. give huge fine would deter sort thing?

Oh right, cuz freedom.

Enjoy dying freedoms, geniuses. USA #1. girl living someone tested positive tell anyone. Anyways started show symptoms told HR. also lunch every day mask course girl share office with. told go home two weeks, tell anyone else. find week one friends told us. nobody department girl tested positive sent home, girl lunch every day. It’s almost like taxing poverty jail time effective! could mitigated US mandatory sick leave policy. LOL corporate america wins again. literally evolved get along family get tested think it, need told do, taking precautions... comment right sums entirety newfound depression. trouble sleeping night knowing heck tomorrow bring, know it'll make upset. Day 8 still waiting results. Tested Berkeley CA. Google Damn. go hospital pneumonia tested kept hrs results came back negative. thoughtful wonderful human being.../s even though obvious. Lol yeah that‘s dilemma don‘t think you‘d much time use brain duch situation Americans sorry Americans. turn around ? seriousness? countrys native language

I know people seem think conspiracy theories limited USA. not. Even Japan them. 

Obviously one worst jobs world worst among world powers. 

Now think find another country poll 1 3 believe it. we've defunded education much match peers domain. hard see got here. 

Straight talk NJ much. Why? we're one best educated states country handling opposite worst states....  charged crime people intentionally coughed people was? eejit knew infected completely ignored saftey people home community. 

She absolutely charged least pay loss income infected. That’s actually illegal employment law Europe. happens it’s extremely rare woman thinks happening grounds go court punished court. 

This document clear don’t care funds come social companies add small top want to. Depending country claim certain tax credits. 
 
Saying women blocked market crazy neo liberal idea thought lobbyist. still astounds guy support. Yeah really depends whether people taking seriously. Trump start taking seriously South became hotspots. makes wonder hoping it'd kill liberal areas. Not. all. Everywhere look San Jose there’s republicans, liberals encountered don’t vote they’re far away lands.  That’s weird way saying “close stores” tests means numbers go down! someone informed sooner! More. Let's compare number [aircraft then!

US: 12

Rest US allies put together: 6

China: 2

Russia: Sorta 1, fire towed back drydock can't travel power.

Rest world (India Thailand): 2

If US went 1 carrier, 90% decrease, USA plus allies would still command majority world's sea power (if measure sea power ability project airpower anywhere, really days), double China Russia combined.

I got photograph 4 US carriers shot; photo double number carriers US's serious rival. death rate heavily dependent age though, population pyramid India looks like actual pyramid. Around 10% India's population aged 60+, compared 22% USA 30% Italy (source agree, estimated number infections seems high. Although, obesity seems play significant role probability death, India one thinnest countries world. till 2022 springs sounds right.

Why would stay home year vaccine available? 14 days 5 consecutive days elevated temperature. Social infrastructure ia great. Hope guys get try someday. Similar thing happened live, US. Guy gets sick, goes work symptoms 2 days. Lives 6 people.... da fuq wrong morons... There’s family england 20 think best graph would 3 lines, cases, Coronavirus Deaths, excess deaths. looking pirate treasure? Please posts links use link shorteners/re-routers obscure true destination link.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  accept this? Watch Reddit even appreciate it. less 400k number seems worse (although acknowledge bueno) large population. cases per 100k 24th nation. Solidly middle pack terms fast virus spreading thru state. why? 


If tests available, use tests quarantine, use symptoms instead.  already see Olympics World Cup year :) people infected, lasting physical damage dies, needs stand trial get thrown jail. Please post/comment music links. 


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* WOW, brain there? Guess race. Cue BLM explosion 3... 2... 1... quarantine period changed two week reccomendation? Moving back home mom while. I'm traveling cross country I've kept relatively well quarantined far want know long I'll quarantine home give mom hug generally around her. Yeah definitely inform roommate. However 2 month old might gotten sick anyways probably financial means seperate everyone house. ah yes you‘re right death big mercy sometimes Depends area, often person would die things like diabetes/heart disease exacerbated virus,i.e. underlying conditions controlled, would alive virus. 

""Italy: report shows Covid direct cause death 89 % people died testing  good job winters trending milder milder last decade! /s. r/nottheonion Yep, watched Behind Curve yesterday, safely say people dangerous. case ""let believe want"", distributing fake news (to keep line topic here) spread misinformation. Climate change one things can't even imagine things change. ""storms kill people often"" full-on Grapes Wrath?

If money, would buy terrain right build house solar panels roof hydroponic farm basement. way, even things go shit, least family would fed.

Until hungry people started raiding homes, course.

But money, I'll live apartment try get best can. nicu hospital full babies 3 different units. there's many premature babies born we're running space. kind disregard everyone around carry heavy penalties. Whatever penalties live altering - 5 years prison 50k fine something. I've seen scary amount Arizona plates town since memorial day weekend. picking Arizonans specifically here, tf thinks tourist pandemic good idea?? hope mess around someone sword cut head America lost stupidity. Anyone brain knew March latest. It'll interesting he's longer president. accuse Democrats responsible bad economic situation and, course, Covid deaths. lot middle class Americans even ability isolate let alone situation. 

Not mention. people risk missing rent, food money, etc

Were taught individualistic. emphasize helping fellow Americans enough. There's LARGE LARGE amount Americans literally see empathy something important teach kids. they've literally done studies it. sad least appreciate right thing right now? It’s also likely better therapeutics better knowledge COVID-19 now. NYC throwing everyone ventilators know probably wasn’t good idea. mention IMAGINE Cali better job protecting nursing homes. Can’t really blame Cuomo sending infected people back mistake repeated worldwide sure wasn’t great idea. looks like new target Within. 

The new Gwangju patient self-quarantine subject 'active monitoring' health authority. ( call twice day check condition practice quarantine measures. ) employee dental hospital alway wear N95 mask. near Gwangju Patient #172. health authority suspect airbone transmission ( how? ) thought solution week ago. Better couple kids study together daughter go elementary 1200 kids via bus. guess depends measure power, conventional sense weren’t imagining enemy would virus opposed hostile foreign nation.   foundation it? really affect ""personal"" wealth take place China, wonder global response would “its flu” know, “Made Switzerland”, good chunk Moderna production (via Lonza) That's they're saying. People talk topic hint eugenics like poor people deserve procreate they're poor. 

Imo gross would many amazing Americans citizens world Probably precedent something viral, agree...we deal much before! diseases HIV applies (like STDs), expert either. California cases per 100k people middle pack. We're 24th saying what's going means good. opened bars indoor dining quickly biting us ass. invent excuses adopt behaviours. Yes first thing felt sympathy. know caused lot harm possibly ruined lives choice perhaps work however selfish. Nope. Stupid people still gonna stupid. 

My thinking that, like ebola, made people bleed eyes something ""visible"" terms severity, **then** *maybe* people would taken seriously. is, still easy ignore, evinced massive number deaths occurring continued, willful ignorance much populace. yeah shit needs stay shut everyone wearing masks every moment spend outside homes. know exclude Elon Musk scum list antibody test apt produce positive result strain Coronavirus - Covid-19 America bloody fucked Stay-at-home till 2022 springs sounds right. Ah yes imagine raging college brats crying spring break next year. Australia plenty test, bought China lol, 10 million tests 25 million people one deal.

The problem moment test kits man power need collect samples lab capacity. even huge issue Victoria stage 3 lockdown. still think strict enough I'm seeing trip CBD last week start see effects showing around next week. think mean condescending disrespectful women, rather woman condescending.

Although also used 'females', could maybe go either way. Moderna pre-commercial company, literally aren’t allowed sell products yet. They’re well funded sure, they’re anywhere close profitable - pouring money R&amp;D clinical trials.  Among findings: Infections 12 times higher deaths 50% higher previously reported, herd immunity “not viable path current pandemic,” Rahmandad said. value testing erodes virus spreads, leaving measures like social distancing, better hygiene, wearing masks useful way contain coronavirus.

Note July 2, 2020: (The paper available preprint yet peer reviewed.) live blocks Kings County Hospital. Constant sirens. poor doctors nurses reusing n95 masks week straight. 

I 1 second day really illustrates dramatic shit got, really quickly. It’s three months complete normalcy: commuting manhattan, hanging friends bars, making nice dinners wife, etc. Mid-March rolls around it’s empty store shelves, worried eyes behind masks, eerie silences, sirens month. Watching now, I’ve noticed got sort normal month ago. That's priority Numero Uno! Lol. thanks. I've done enough staying home. Life goes on. death probably near 200k. Hospitals accused covering deaths listing causes death Pneumonia, concerned PR actual statistics, tracing etc. well affecting Outpatient procedures brings tons $$$. mention certain US states simply hiding numbers. look accounts Hospital staff pressured say anything, treat like something else HR, Management early outbreak.

The United States country, business. Probably less stress work too. Less eatouts possibly healthier food home. Eh, someone goes around spraying bullets crowded spaces focus deaths, many bullets person used. ""He used 10x many bullets first thought!"" make devastation less shocking. 144,000 dead counting US, herd immunity sight (even 10x number.) Arent tests like 30% false negative something insane? know lot testing centers letting people self swabs seems completely pointless given unpleasant nasal swab is. really think people going inflict kind self discomfort properly? made doctors. fuck know epidemiology fluid dynamics.  

but need patients go bankrupt. Boom, doctor visit low risk now. example: that‘s today folks partner’s sisters Arizona got symptoms hard - coughing, fever, shortness breath telltale symptom, loss taste. certain it. got tested, 14 days later results come back negative. Unbelievable shit show. honestly plausible explanation come Ah yes, that's totally fine. Shows think 3 months advance, that's it. “Banning public gatherings unnecessary travel proven quite effective virus.”

Wait, entirety thread everyone else fucking hysterical outrage increase cases. shut downs restrictions effective not? Make mind. AZ average test return 13 days. getting results actually takes 13 days, labs backlogged takes time get queue. lol no. anyone trusts anything China puts fool. rule trusting countries concentration camps set forced sterilization organ harvesting. what’s bottleneck? feel bad kid, parents nothing prevent getting virus. Saw Herriman without masks, like everything normal. reminder:

will hospital issue statement contradict this? talking everyone. talking pharmaceutical manufacturers. say motivated greed? Good decisions come experience.

Experience comes bad decisions. called “Me generation” good reason.   Yeah people don’t seem get hospitals ICUs overrun COVID patients someone gets motorcycle accident dies ICU bed available death caused COVID. saying narcissistic people tend behave selfish? Genious helps SF Bay Area especially lot tech companies want employees work home. I'm surprised Santa Clara County's jump, bad compared places I'm pretty sure government step buy supply distribute it. capped price since could investigate price gouging.  Academics willing produce reports support whatever political aims government are, contribute public distrust finding solutions pandemic. dont know im united states still get news buffon every day first time hear makin sense Hope spend much study. county, answer ""no insurance"", free. Thankfully. No, can't buy alcohol stores. asked family friend this, doctor originally India. looked headline second, paused seconds, said “ohhh, no. Wait made here” Lol live Bay Area 100000000% mostly liberal lol One roommate complaining news seems arrested porch pirate 

These type people living 16 house. 
Let’s forget garage probably converted room Let's go america *America speed* way public skeptical? think lower that's good sign Trump. think anyone challenge trials. People volunteered, think happening.  Jesus understand. get minor win, even close pandemic, people jaded. 

People like say together, gunna elicit positive reaction political mocking people whose mind trying change.

We boat sinking, time smug shit done. during. Yep. disease two phases: viralogical immunological. Typically virus clears quickly (12-15 days), secondary inflammatory response takes that's killing people. Giving antiviral trying suppress viral replication much good virus already decline immune dysfunction already taken over. Better outcomes achieved managing inflammation coagulation.  Em-bare-fucking-assing! think point, glad he's it. USA certainly textbook example do. Depending old grandmother might never see grandchild anyways! here’s [study USA specifically showing excess deaths March May 28% higher official death That's happens California tiny studio $2200 month. buy tiny condo size $700k. get decent amount space couple least $3000.

Housing control. Normal people need live 16 people. understand unwilling wear mask distance made compulsory. 

Even people know talk inconvenience... ever work outside hot day? worse that? even remember felt like wear mask year?

That Starbucks *just had* get, even remember week? Blake Street Tavern disgusting, struggling Covid-19 nothing lose suing! half-true. Anti-maskers care *only* themselves. know hospitals lobbied hard state shut down. don’t want cancel electives and/or people get spooked cancel appointments cuz money. assure basically think anywhere else world existing. example week they'll talk schools need reopen. I, actual teacher lay least dozen logistical reasons impossible fail within weeks harm lot people. They'll rebut bunch bullshit can't really know without trying, kids really get sick, kids spread etc....then post articles Israel opened schools May went EXACTLY told would. either respond say Israel America happen here.

It's reason say nationalized healthcare destroy country dive us socialist dystopia every developed nation world gets fine it. country world possibly anything better US they're talking politics. no, countries. Tons people coming back living Mexico wanting medical care here. Imperial County inundated shipping patients Cal. Sad thing people still saying “fake news” fake numbers ex. parents Good one! well, point. every society poor people (which means every society) period time huge families norm. idea kids = chances survive, tough care lot kids, investment pays eventually parents convinced never see grandchildren again. “When give food poor, call saint. ask poor food, call communist.” - Dom Hélder Câmara gonna die shitty BLM-corona-protests neanderthal behaviour. Even celebrities country mass murderers propaganda. bunch idiots. kid thumbnail crazy hair plant foreground? real, past presidencies like?  going say lot older people died already. also mind person behind survey is. Perhaps encouraged deliver arguments favour school re-openings? 

I dunno, US. People worse. know whataboutism imagine kid Europe 1940? anywhere 1918? Thankfully better understanding put things perspective. 

And better bad mental health time responsible spread death. living 11 children, absolutely cannot afford higher rent ability miss work still pay rent, regardless they're would vote prompted Donald this?

Lots people saying best non-psychopath reasons nothing intense sense jealousy, insatiable greed virulent masochism treats every situation life with, mainstream media report reasons of, guessed it... China.  It’s good. bc downvote doesn’t mean right;). Numbers numbers. grew Massachusetts similar (liquor stores even open sundays) getting lax. Even still, liquor stores close 10 latest there, that's place get like Texas.

Moving Florida 10 years ago able buy beer supermarkets gas stations 2am (1 gas station near 5am!) liberating. That's even real name.

[He's fucking Lizard Say ? No.
But 10+ kids ans cant provide fault.
I might large family internet knows. point people need take responsabilities. able provide kids one.

I love people argue people getting pets giving told ""dont take animals cant pay them"""".. know inhumane think way things life. 13days? Thats fucked up. have/had wait 21hrs fair Healthcare System overwhelmed capacity Test fast. understand (at least long ago) labs allowed improve testing Speed automate steps us- manually put samples Test Liquid use machine test batches like 60 samples one step. Think regulation... wouldn’t look good 200,000 people dead election time doesn’t try act like gives shit. Total hypocrite. still 200,000 dead nov 5 least say supported wearing mask. He’s got new campaign manager. Roughly 1 3 Americans get news right wing media like FOXNEWS. Lucy! there's Cletus along rest gang know? children innocent. Tough law enforcement whether mandated not. body LA cares. three five days return Covid-19 test results someone someone hospital, LabCorp able return Covid-19 tests results within 1.5 days average,

The tests Korea (and Maryland) used take 4 hours. gave people highway checkpoints waited. Germany also drive testing. can't use furrin made tests cuz Murica. knowingly infecting someone illness crime, famously punished HIV cases law anything infectious.

Not true anymore, lot states classified sex another partner risk. (There exceptions non consensual intent purposely spread large scale NY law example this)  Key word slowly, unlike cluster fuck US. know said sounded condescending, hard truth poverty cycle. hope one day broken done generation gets educated stay away bad media influences communities promote within themselves. choices probably work starve.

And US president dares call nations ""shithole countries"". Come ""communist"" side. free healthcare, parental leave unemployment benefits. Nobody needs starve. guess depends company. company pulled people projects losing money regard... well need make profit. publicly traded company, may fiduciary responsibility make money shareholders no? 

For company like Moderna, first RMA vaccine, positive press may worth stupidly evil exploitative. use tech make lots vaccines, well bumper payday road. 

All said, can't see much price gouging going on. looks like several vaccine candidates choose come 2021. competition drive profit margins. probably poor trying make rent lot roommates. Likely works service-type job offers work-at-home option. Life pretty hard income level. Yes It’s uncommon point. seems incredibly common women, specifically. 

Literally 50% population worldwide VitD insufficiency.. distribution humans says can’t live darker/less sunny climates; known problem worldwide. don’t want fuck ghosts demons, guess believe it. Science hasn’t proven non-existence yet false metrics measure intelligence.   
  
1/3 can’t find Louisiana map. can’t either, what...? gonna try know too, fuck care? metrics intelligence? Lol.  
  
I agree whole argument two points weak/ irrelevant are, account guests wear mask entire time served. yet, folk still dead. Reality fucking care decide believe it. Either election tested positive (probably both) Yeah, although I'm sure students, often dependents parents, would counted data.

I think many college towns list industry beyond businesses supporting college community way, jobs end service jobs low wages I’m staying restaurants. lived closed weeks. Restaurant workers still pay bills shit. think Jonny Linecook, health insurance, work would let take day without extreme hassles anyway, 2 months back bills pay, making enough get pandemic, think starts getting sick he’s letting anyone know? Maybe, someone cooked restaurants long, long time, know culture work important. paying bills. I’ve saying awhile restaurants bars going hotspots, it’s happening. wait conspiracy theorists discover they’re part conspiracy use conspiracy theorists spread disinformation via conspiracy theories Garcetti it. already lifted again. article states ""overabundance caution"". honest - could done better. property manager would called health department lockdown (not way around). 

If house lot vulnerable people mentioned article would happy manager though. least that's better stories find dead bodies weeks. bad he'll probably cause harm good. 

The one consistent thing say man. Wishful thinking. Consumer confidence damaged badly. economy gonna flop one way other. Choronavirus? Chonovirus? OHH “China virus” many %% live organ damage? That’s assumption everyone America driven greed. statement true many, it’s unfair unjust assume everyone driven greed. Face masks = better rating.... NOTHING due protecting health anyone. would cautious picture suggests. One researchers (bottom right) George Mason University. That’s freak show school teach Austrian economics (pseudoscience). stay home. Drug companies spend advertising r&amp;d.

The congressional GAO study determined us would save billions universities,.hospitals NIH/CDC drug development contracted pharma firms for.production. also determined we'd develop lot useful drugs boner pill 2.0 obviously live bay area.  That’s Kurt Vonnegut. could argue everything wrote, published, comparably excellent also horrifying. 

...So goes. welcome internet, let us know questions Biden terrible mask wearer. hate seeing go give speeches everyone removes masks talk. SURPRISE! wearing mask room full virus, mask slow virus hits outside mask. there... inch mouth nose. bad spot. mask still help, basically defending bunch simultaneous penalty kicks entire team nothing goaltender. 

If people wear masks, virus getting slowed much farther away you. virus get past mask necessarily anywhere near you. That's like team field playing man man coverage. 

In either case, ball get past defenses, odds better start defending farther goal.

Disclaimer: I'm scientist doctor play sports. got you.. heard icu olive branch lost 5 patients day covid. must counties. muh Freedom says Karen cases slightly dipping trending downward high 10,000+ cases days ago, deaths hospitalizations predictably increased since lag time those, unfortunately. 

On one hand, might say, Texas shown early signs peaking. hand, deaths hospitalizations continue grim longer. 

Can’t state enough: Tragically avoidable! Herd immunity would mean like 75% percent population. comments think true too, lot localized various hotspots would difficult extrapolate. Many us high risk area. work home state 0 cases 4 months. I'm going get vaccine see lining day one. 5 days right werent thinking 20 percent nyc thats 2mil even gotten started gas looked one chart internet figured that's Truth.

OK, tap gone. Facebook source use hahahha. Masks also strip away freedom hahahahahah Oh shit 200 deaths one state. That’s biggest number I’ve seen while. know several people lost weight without intending to, simply changing routines regarding eating restaurants. 6 times deadly is... really much tbh. thought would see shit disney banned smoking. pay lot security parks. really know anyone problem smoking areas tho get big advantage Jerid kushner? Raise bridges, let ivory flag fly! Alas, it’s time shut ‘er Abbott. much higher that. article misleading. Underestimates IFR covid, uses 5x high mortality flu (it 0.02% 0.1%). buddy damn stupid hard fathom.

ironically figure 6 also shows chance mutation mmW frequencies 0. infact, 0 anything except things 1e-9 wavelength corresponds frequency 299792458000 MHz. 1e-9 wavelength millimeter wave, nanometer wave. 

btw, LTE wavelength 59mm, 5G mm region around 9mm. 

from absolute joke figure indicates decreasing wavelength (&lt; 10-3m), waves pass cell membrane interact DNAs.

well 5G mmW 9*10^-3, even stupid paper, 5G mmw interact DNA.


i mean deeper dig dumber paper gets. yeah, practically fractal stupidity, everytime zoom notice stupid

edit: asked 4 year old 9 larger 1. said yes. officially smarter content paper. So.... don’t open door. 🤷‍♀️ add German-specific miracle. Pretty much European countries played book, minor disagreements other. addition said, governments opposition parties meetings synchronize messaging. Daily briefings actually used covid-related briefings. Governments acknowledged mistakes, planned ahead. etc.

Heck, European countries played nicer (despite war existence) states within US!

As result, despite looming recession, EU seems actually getting first wave better image among citizens. Comparing situation US left exercise reader. gonna end divorce anyway ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Ok?

We different reading levels, judgement, impression typed words “Huntington beach trash”? 250 million Americans? emboldening argument make sense me. Seatbelts make people drive faster, sprinkler systems make people play fire indoors, could possibly afraid of? People gathering groups thousands close quarters screaming yelling hours end? Like protests? bet breaches people swinging shops way home test. get told test can't leave house till get results. Freaking asymptomatic spread. Oh turntables turned... elites getting covid? could educate people ask basic questions, instead assuming coming bad place.

You little pollyana heart's content, live world 31 percent americans think CDC inflating covid deaths actually undercounting them.


Meanwhile propaganda predicting virus mutate become mutate times mutations weaker strain. saying case, still valid question nonetheless

Viruses mutate sometimes strain lethal.

Furthermore, given mild coronavirus people little reason think kind mutation makes less lethal communicable would selected for. 


Shit currently, looks like second strain(that came Italy ravaged New York), opposite thing think could possibly true happened.


As explaining ignorant, someone else answered question, explain you.

I never said answered, said question reasonable, isn't.

laters.  watched [60 Minutes said it. date March 8th. 

He says ""The masks important someone infected prevent infecting someone else. look films see people- like China, everyone running around wearing mask-- right now, United States, people walking around masks... There's reason walking around mask.""
He goes say people wear improperly, fiddle face, false sense security. goes say people need infected healthcare workers need thinking healthcare workers specifically everyone buying could lead shortage masks.

And clear, talking medical grade masks, cloth masks, even really table yet. 

Nothing said lie. based commonly accepted science based knew time, said wrong revised opinion. That’s antibody tests for. Also, tests problems fuck get 50% false positive from? false positives high mortality rate would MUCH higher (because there’d less actual cases). likely. New Yorkers: CHALLENGE ACCEPTED. Ahhhhhhh pandemic get way plans???? Can't masks, according Facebook, work, make sicker! too. lots different flu strains. flu vaccine changes year depending researchers best determine strains people encounter get sick from. never fool proof, pretty good job. even conversation increased daily death totals 50% lows 2 weeks... current trajectory puts us back averages next weeks. 

Do believe trending positively? sure peak epidemic NY/NJ/CT comparable places even seeing 1% positive test rates. pull quote showed people hopes discrediting me. Yes, wrong say that, we're saying I'm disgusting human saying (which mistake), argue points ""approved"" ones here. Truth family friends care about. would never want get anything might endanger them. get people frightened scared want get back normal. However, time, even though people saying silver bullet, treating like is. become moral test moreso medical one. become hyped much foregoing social distancing, self isolation, maintaining good immune system possible, keeping care vulnerable, etc. end getting virus despite masks, want sure able recover without much damage, unfortunate luck passing along, would able recover, too. could come vaccinations acquired immunity (note say herd immunity). getting hit hard new virus (thus body learning trying figure fight it) US health system ALWAYS sucked.

It's going help fighting amongst one another something we've made moral test one allowed challenge anyone saw something made sure method, sure hell help response ""you care others"" (really?), ""stop making excuses"". botch said end post? Yes, admit fucked there. mean arguments worth having. article actually underestimates. doomed 1% likely die nothing. wear mask, asshole. We're summer peak Ontario Show math reduced risk reduced enough.

I’m still waiting source scientists surprised spreads. pretty big sources realized making stuff up.

I’m intimately familiar layout stadium. Judging picture, it’s bowl style may may indoor areas ringing outside. Would okay closed merch areas? Limited access bathrooms?

Those concerns addressed, suspect don’t actually want addressed, came way get conclusion already had: “football game = bad.”

As link said, previous outbreaks associated outdoor activities likely result related indoor activities. It’s sports match, it’s crowded bar scene surrounding sports match. definitely attack angle. Since Frankensteined trial vaccine elite ?

I’d think Russian Elites COVID would going country estates hunting helicopters Amen someone unfriend FB told coronavirus tracker phone useless without turned downloading app available three states (and live one those). fine Facebook tracking every move guess.  Me,me,me, us,us,us....F them. Lame brains thought would over? American ego gets best them. person aiming comments at, naysayer-in-chief. mean yes, 99% goes decimal places. false positivity rate falls margin error statistically insignificant.

Edit:Wait no. yes. stats make sense. think works way. gonna fight fires America India? Build houses America india? happens ill impressed. really, somewhat fudged stat based bunch stats various sources various years (some years vaccines better matched active strains others). [But article talking 2017 vaccination 2017 CDC study first kind show flu vaccination reduced risk flu-associated death half (51 percent) among children underlying high-risk medical conditions nearly two-thirds (65 percent) among healthy children.  Orange county residents threatened health official death open forum suggesting making masks mandatory pandemic. Huntington beach is, fact, trash. Thissssss really care evidence. find inconvenient uncomfortable wear one cling less embarrassing excuse. Honestly felony cannot expunged every employer knows stupid refuse wear mask.

Edit: lol anti-mask terrorists downvoting county republicans accused governor “gross abuse power” acting like “de facto King.” 
Huh. 
But everything trump somehow a-ok. 
I can’t imagine muscular brains must mental gymnastics. greater Houston area. Hard say fall-off last 2 days actually trend. Honestly, I'm perfectly ok living world everyone needs booster shot every 6 months. least comparison now... previous reply insinuate political party United ideology? course Democrats put corporate donors pedestal, American way. much less try trample people setting pedestal Republicans. I'm arguing Democrats saints, Republicans ones causing current situation bad majority population. Republican leadership way, unemployment would never expanded, people would given fuck assistance, testing would still limited rich powerful. Democrats force Republican hand throughout entire crisis. yeah, sides shitty. Republicans much shittier amazing anyone still goes bat them. But, suppose that's expect people willing support someone uses racist, white nationalist rhetoric appeal base. mention sex masks kissing. Covid particles small typical cloth covering/surgical mask protect catching it, protects others catching you. possible? they're small enough come mask infect me, would covid particles expelled mouth/nose contained mask? I've seen videos/articles particle spread vs. without mask, assume larger particles/bacteria reduced.

Respiratory droplets virus travels human human. fabric mask stop particles size. Sounds like bunch Republicans crying getting social democracy. participate social contract share considerations it. Where's bootstraps? confirm. Target Clarksville recently got hell asap. dip-shit-othon. Never going happen, fresh humans produced faster spread. imagine self centered would endanger entire family friends. give marriage 2 months. 400 month? Fuck hard, ass lube googly eyed looking motherfucker Yeah, scenario, can’t go neighbors house fire chief doesn’t care house. cares whether gets re-elected fire chief. Stop defending shit. act properly. group ment protect us pandemic regardless effective actually highlighted important proactive is. That's caused issue America. tell dumb people serious let decide based information. it’s really “immunity” like resistant way bulletproof vests aren’t bullet immune, they’re bullet resistant.

Look measles breakthrough infections. city? listened in, joined late, sounds like could city. better way start marriage putting others danger! Congrats! worry pink line, especially contrasting [this [this I'm demanding though. well front door. soooo...... attitude seems show people subconsciously see people poorer countries less important. think it’s ok place like Brazil exploding cases similar manner USA, it’s shitty dirty Brazil they’re bad anyway, right? Obviously don’t think that, still. It’s pretty expensive still experimental hah Likely around 100x used CFR flu instead IFR. underestimated IFR covid using old data.  except ones overpopulated 2nd world nations less best healthcare systems. Yes, he's still infected. someone managed get away, returned back like Stockholme syndrome stuff, also say it. numbers going slightly. moved final stages reopening makes sense see uptick. Personally think opened indoor dining quickly. 

I wouldn’t shocked tick back reopening phase things continue rise. wouldn’t call spike though. Perhaps elevation? yourself. type state countries compare hard long place locked down. USA average world.  6 months late! everyone else world died. Seriously annoying people keep looking back white. Die live. No! LONG TERM STUDIES. many ways virus disable someone. immune disorder hyperactive side complications get surprisingly bad, especially heart. customers need forcibly removed trespassing law enforcement. sex without condom random stranger too? ""Meh, risk low, not. YOLO!"" .....y'all making 

Late February thing. far thee worst cough ever had, chest pains insane cough, fever though. went doctors room me. doctor checked maybe like 3 times, never even got told had. 

Just gave things help combat symptoms

Eventually went away, voice screwed whole time lol still tickle speak much throat eventually hurts. Luckily I'm pretty clean person, wear mask, coughed bad sneezed tissues threw immediately 🤣 Shit sad want vaccine come man Well officially mandate, suggestion. Tbh I'm laughing banana suggesting blow job 🤣 228.2 million, rest u.s. Flu also undercounted. IFR flu estimated 0.02%. article misleading. OH! feel slightly dumb. didnt go it. Seeing people absolutely lose shit would hilarious.

To top off, worn lizard mask worn illuminati symbol. selective memory surreal. perhaps bounce 1k fall again, think dead cat bounce.

There way we’re heading back 1.5k-2k areas death per day.

Stay classy Merica! wonder new cases peak due testing shortage whether true plateau infected. nearly .025% nyc's population die? ~ hyperbole ~ husband too. knew cold something wrong.

- Political scientist probably. No, won’t. There’s nothing speculation behind that, none graphs data show anything like months time.

We would go even higher exponentially first time see happening. Again, that’s bad misinformation. Yup. medical expert saying ""there long term damage!"". They're saying COULD be, know shit guessing, observing long term exist disease even existed 1 year..

Obviously talking severe cases obvious damage maybe even go ventilator. fucks up, excluded article. mild/middle strong cases. hometown, get ass kicked.

Well done America really fucked one big time probably would open them. actually anything saying British nationals only. Ever think don’t conventional war well armed populous military?
Cutting military there’s war lot like firing security guard there’s robberies. elementary educator/specialist sees 450+ students per week hot state (Wisconsin), terrified. excited go back percentages 2-3% June, apparently meant “all bets want.” I’m expected potentially sacrifice family’s life system broken parents need chose livelihood family’s health.

This strange hill die on. stop. going happen lot companies year. lot public schools. military get immune? We've lost 2020. entire year normalcy...gone. really sucks. Even vaccine going take years recover we've lost. Arrest guy. Charge attempted murder. there's hell living near Disney World; want live south side Orlando, since housing unaffordable workers there, try find place north side.

That’s several hundred million dollars right there. They’re also developing nasal formulation remdesivir another several hundred millions dollars. 

They also invested heavily manufacturing high risk around January February even knew remdesivir would work COVID (before clinical trials ran). absolutely bad business move could cost, again, hundreds millions right move cared lot drug hand treat people. way way COVID even US public’s mind. still mostly China nobody knew whether going worldwide pandemic.

Smaller military, means smaller PP. Florida become shriveled, Florida people Yeet right back inside. Pharma producer really want compete government?

Have look Viagra vs India. work well. hit herd immunity accident. gonna bare plague fullest Fauci, CDC, Surgeon General, lied, put life, around risk death disability. 

So yeah, credibly shit I'm going believe future. 

The problem lying people need people follow advice future, people might believe since previously lied. R0 1 means spread stops increasing speed. R0 1 getting 10000 new cases still good, means keep getting 10000 cases day run people infect. need R0 drop dramatically outbreak significance. True, however largest spread came week 9 Stockholmers returned holiday, Austrian, French Italian Alps biggest holiday destinations week. doubt came countries too, looking big initial spread started, everything points towards Alps major vector. look see sentinel samples strains could found Italy Austria. Later sentinel samples seem indicate dominating strains Italy longer present (so spread stopped) dominating strain Austria is, essentially completely missed stop Austrian spread, bigger skiing destination Italy.

EDIT: quarantined since Austria added list several weeks later (week 11). Also, showed symptoms asked quarantine. Norway blanked 14 day quarantine travellers Alps, symptoms not. Americans wanna add zero end number He’s wrong. asshole one them. Well actually wasn’t old enough vote 2016 pretty diehard him. bumper sticker put yard signs.

While don’t like reaction virus, stand stuff. I’m 18 voting him, think reluctant vote.

If you’re anti Trump, think way: diehard supporter become casual supporter, casual supporters probably don’t like more. someone quick math show get 1 100. mean every 100 people see, potentially one infected? Math best subject yet want learn. Probably damn monkey again.  Still calling 'China Virus' huh? fact well half claims made absolutely citations red flag. won’t risk dumbassery.

I school thought here. One thing I'd say different though **less** risk dubassery.  much, know. roughly expect guard another 2 years, that's effective vaccines. Wanna know why: *antivaxxers*

Look don’t care it’s religious thing (for gods sake, I’m catholic well I’ve vaccinated.) ,but youre vaccinated simply don’t want there’s evidence, youre fool idiot Oh, noticed caught lying, exaggerating immunity levels, downplaying situation nonsense poured mouth?
I guess swedish? know legit lockdown put effort unlike us. you...yelp? wonder he'll throw strike. people don’t like opinions you’re allowed post. sure? sociopaths clearly know actions viewed bad others, might care people themselves. Got it. counter argument lack emotional maturity admit wrong (probably also type thinks locking good despite increased deaths came it) instead wanna cry personal attacks

have fun that. confirming initial assumptions can't admit Sweden fucked correct suppose better late never, near 150k people trumps chance another 4 years office die reach point. Millions lives changed ways couldn’t comprehend forever. fucking joke human skin, wrapped loosely leaking bag, alcoholics dark yellow piss. No, doesn’t. Yes, know articles read. No, didn’t say think said. irony deaths antishut people hailed unacceptable hardship early days, consequence opening early running beds come discussion way less often data point data point.

no, single data point anecdote.   home thing unfortunate don’t blame her. Going work irresponsible illegal. TWIV last week too. game changer hope people clamor it. don’t need PCR every test  ...ok.

I see know FDA works, either. telling. rush vaccine

Oh, writes NDAs well? Stay safe! thing real, we’ll get staying far away people aren’t taking seriously, wearing masks, washing hands.

I’ve worried start impact even small surge remote areas. refrigerated morgue trucks terrifying, highly visible marker calamity, smaller communities without resources handle surge even dozen cases going tragedies too, less visible photo-ready. think Snopes underplayed rating (they fairly often), case I've seen made they're reporting 100% positive, must reporting positives. case - they're reporting total tests, giving accurate count positives. things? came say exactly this, real message story CA zoning housing policy nuts Maybe different come from. brought UK, Midlands, invariably kull-dee-sack, unless fancy kid gets private schooling.

NYC 2664     
NY 1664

Poor us. comparison. country try hard embarrass me? lying gov got (with helpful street parties) mess? Oh, believe him! do! seem largest effect lowering mortality compared drugs they’ve studying look numbers.. like found drug effect would considered breakthrough sure ITT: People wanting people suffer Yet somehow Detroit hollowed despite much worse poverty.

Detroit hollowed due middle class collective crab-bucket delusion going people tell impossible leave.

It real Republican bootstrapping blame people moving. Life complicated lot people rely government assistance. Exactly thoughts. talks FDA push need community support financing keep tests $1 Newsflash tia 18 siblings, DAmN MeXiCAnS;) Yes. point don’t think anybody expecting coronavirus eradicated. Although could see political might wealthy countries making honest goddamn attempt it. Depends many doses needed per person. I'd assume two. Except immunity seems disappear months. still think manufactured professor guy Harvard one students allowed escape Wuhan way back.

but involves American, US can't blame China. ""Natural"" China hired moonlight Harvard American DoD job researcher extra side job working Wuhan Bio Weapons Research. Literally Bio Weapons research one students captain PLA China student got caught Philes (vile) FBI airport. 

the story since disappeared seems. Yeah, pretty much pneumonia subsequent inflammation towards end disease that's people in. It’s pre purchase contract 100 million units assuming phase 3 goes well. Well that’s problem isn’t it?

So. Many. lies. title end with. ""She drug street face wronged beaten accordingly."" well duh. Nothing world free. Interestingly, California decriminalized knowing willful transmission deadly disease another person. happened year back.

So legally, think worst could misdemeanor  really asshole someone claims virtuous.  La County tests Arizona, 20,000 10 million. Sources?  don’t say Currently work big medical center, every single employee gets test every week turnaround time 24hrs. 99.8% negative rate. state (MA) established contract testing center, way we've rolled emulated universities neighboring states. 

My state general taking seriously. I've seen one person wearing mask around neck public since virus broke out. Everyone else wears mask problem. Hand sanitizer available every entrance everywhere. means we're one states spiking cases. curve flattened degree overwhelming hospitals anymore. medical lessons learned virus hits multiple organs hard led change medical treatment....leading people surviving. 

Coincidentally, state trying prevent people traveling states outbreaks else self quarantine 14 days. workplaces find traveled someplace like texas, tell state public health office given stern letter stating *have* self isolate. 95% us ""get it"" gives hope people want killer virus running wild community. state leadership shit shit happens, hope regular person want killer virus running wild kick bad leadership. attacking soldiers defense battle far justified police killing innocent unarmed black people. Go enjoy free air elsewhere told NOAA re-draw re-issue hurricane alert. seriously think numbers tanking 3 months away election going try politically influence FDA??? 


He undoubtedly thinks rush vaccine help re-election chances, serious concern arent enough people left federal institutions tell no. boyfriend’s boss. thankfully didn’t contact other, i’m immunocompromised. mutual quit job fears infecting elderly mother. it’s shitshow. surely must people living county opposed contentious decisions made county government. suffer even funding withheld? would love see happen, since work large retailer pharmacy, able get injection right work. practically live anyway. got flu shot lunch break. 

I hope eventually becomes easily available us work public every day. There's degree emotional strain that's affecting us. someone (LA Austin), easier seems.

Apply jobs first. Video interviews common think. part take matter many hundreds 'no's get, one yes matters.

Once job, apply apartment. again, video interviews common. landing site need great, safe. able inspect focus places high reviews rather features. time contract expires familiar area inspect next apartment person

Last, move itself. expensive want make it. Uhaul trailers cost hundred dollars, possible stick bare necessities car drive cost gas.

And that's it. stuff like change address forms registering new license plate/driver's license etc expensive.  There's really point make fun sport, kind detracts main point. Coward 16 people. one house. California. 

Yep, confirm, takes least 16 people pay one room studio *somewhat* decent area Cali. lie cheat steal way making happen.

He statutorily authority this, please continue. Getting FDA approve drug likely easy task him

How many NDAs filed? idea FDA even works?


Your Enlightenment showing, good look you. rip veil off, they're running show. Corruption incompetence abound, racism open, stupidity endemic. 

It's complete disaster. Actually I’ve seen commercials like that, specifically mothers young children, one “it’s daughter’s birthday tomorrow you’re sick now?”

And take NyQuil knock self get “good sleep” hosting birthday party next day. like assume countries flop bellies take arse without reacting. 

Look Spain. Shit flares shutdown. 

Flare ups going happen it’s countries responsibility fight them. 

We know it’s done now. We’ve already done successfully. comfortable couch. recommended daily upper limit 4,000. see higher doses recommended doctors correct deficiencies, monitored actually need it. 

If know that, telling people much anything take reason. predicted another outbreak re-opening...... 6 7 weeks ago pick order restaurant near Charlotte. 


I n95 on. Nobody else place wearing mask, little social distancing, people bar sitting right next other.  


There stares snickers direction. One mom family(kids) even tried covertly take photo wanted order host station. 

I wonder many infected now. What? Pfizer american company? I’m confused also. still need research voting? want go I'm whole gambling thing half people would travelling really wanted go much could do, lol. Whenever end going, I'm sure we'll go Las Vegas, too, matter season end travelling :/ Detroit city, California entire state. 

Also, housing California expensive. larger cities college towns problems everywhere. payment go private company government? likely require least 2 shots I’ve read. Plus big questions when/if need booster. It’s *possible* vaccines could need booster within months. don’t know yet. Both, yes.

Bills pay, people infect. $100,000 practically poverty line San Francisco bay area. Salaries higher, living expenses higher. There's involved much someone earns. simple. absolutely agree many people over-extended could live within means. sake argument, really matter ""could"" though. matters done. that's what's going determine situation behavior now. 

And worth remembering economy depends over-extension degree we've encouraged it. Banks made (and continue make, despite recent crises) home loans people can't afford. Cars get sold zero down, loans made people already heads credit wise. Credit card offers come people who've already maxed every card own. Blaming people over-extending bit like blaming alcoholic one. responsible? Absolutely. realistic think stop own, end bad situation easy make choice? Probably not. allow credit companies prey people's desires ignorance facilitate over-extension find in. Couple huge numbers people actually make enough live on, arrive situation we're today, population serious trouble moment economy falters. claim: 

""Yes ""neurological issues"" sounds bit threatening ""headaches"" ""fatigue"" ""insomnia"", kind things make bulk talking say ""neurological issues""."" 

For would like evidence. implies mean regards covid could wrong?

I show mine show yours? Deal? doubt 11 hers. 5 adults house... think actually it. fucking shady moment began unfold. news reports indicating going get tested mild symptoms. definitely California, incredibly hard build high density housing California zoning restrictions.

Detroit going recession, makes sense buy buildings hold renovate them, building worth enough get funding renovate.

California bubble, buildings definitely worth renovating. Obviously depends area building, general rule SF/LA owners choice. never support him, it’s obvious going say defence this.

He said support wearing masks go outside cannot maintain 6 feet social distance.

Clearly tit still wearing mask, back words actions, yeah waiting spin come saying this. move toward curbside pick up, seriously hope business think accommodate drive. Plenty people walk bike store. needs appropriate space reserved wait order. think kind thing easily inadvertently missed would impact. ￼￼ say shades Nazis? Yes, it’s lot people aggregate. It’s “extremely high” proportion. accurate.

but kind false pos easy mitigate.

this kind testing they're MLB.

test every 2 days, **with** 2x daily symptom checks.

access swab antibody tests needed.

I think schools probably try follow model.

players allowed park run temp.

then kinds NEGATIVE testing get back Individuals monitored throughout spring training, regular season, postseason. **They undergo multiple daily temperature checks, anyone registers 100.4-degree temperature higher sent home (or told stay home) quarantined tested**. Players coaches tested COVID-19 every day. Covered Individuals tested multiple times per week. Everyone undergo antibody testing approximately month.  30 [MLB required dedicated testing area ballpark well dedicated isolation area far possible stadium's main baseball facilities. isolation area used Covered Individual ""develops symptoms learns positive test result COVID-19 (so they) isolate temporarily pending relocation home medical facility outside Club facility."" still difficult comparison lockdowns. People live normal lifes right now, work home etc. True, easily treatable antibiotics. also visible disease, anyone generally able quarantined spreading far wide. last big plague scare actually 2017 outbreak Pneumonic Plague occurred Madagascar ended killing 221 people there... Read government creating money buy bonds help prop economy.

The stimulus package helped market (and particular helped certain businesses well already wealthy) far continuing efforts go help, coming package. want super, super risk adverse:

* everyone quarantine two weeks before
* interact outside
* Stay 6 feet apart whole time
* Wear masks entire time

That said, risk tolerance. I've comfortable seeing family members friends outside \~6 feet away without masks without quarantining, know they've wearing masks everywhere responsible. going problem south US. global economy going massive correction. pandemic terrible economic repercussions going far worse. Alright, that's legitimate. read article, covers thing, without tone guess pick pro-anti-mask (lol). honestly bad think bias plays part here. 

&amp;#x200B;

When read said customers would pull masks down, others would report state instead social distancing... kind agreed moved past it. Unfortunately, see people compliant fully compliant time keep distance I'm afraid confrontation might mean. small, East Asian woman, I'm going try anything. definitely felt employee gut reaction like ""why face potential harm this?"" Sorry, man! response #2 wholly irrelevant; take advice there? far tell, fair say Norway open Sweden well month now. Gatherings 200 people allowed since June 15 example, compared 50 Sweden. [VG's corona nice graphs timeline restrictions *tiltak*. Norway averaged around 11 new confirmed cases per day last month.

Norway also opened high schools May 11, Sweden waited till June 15. one ever mentions that, whatever reason.

There's method keep infections long relatively infected: [contact isolation. seemed highly likely would effective already March people paid attention South Korea, obvious April. Norwegians [did pay  think fourth point confirmed. hypothesized people lack cellular receptor known ccr5, may immune plague. Lack receptor also confers immunity HIV far aware. I’m male. mean ticket locking UK like happened NZ would disastrous effects economy.

We locked case, shows have, fewer people would died. probably know Remdesivir safe pregnant women. would seem large percentage stuff might default position unless there's informed consent. many idiots like behaving exactly way? work home cycle variety super brutal. Days losing meaning often leads depression well. “if get COVID-19, — go school — they’re going hospitals. They’re going sit doctor’s offices. They’re going go home they’re going get it.” Missouri Governor Mike Parson I’m pretty sure went long without working out. Americans stupid get flu vaccine. world improves every far-right funeral. Everything I’ve read said take long time likely return people lose it. Everyone I’ve known lost sense smell taste (I wasn’t one them, case minor borderline asymptomatic) got back within 2 months, timelines varied. kids different schools. One requires recommends it. difference? one requires laboratory school owned University 20 less kids per grade (ie: money). ""city school"" serves 4,000 kids spread six schools (ie: money).

The school requires masks also providing them.

(Personally, we're virtual, schools option.) never heard Krogers names. good data there, citations.

Honestly think mortality rate well understood all. article linked says overall average fatality rate estimated 0.68%. Whereas divide reported deaths cases US get 3.5%. mean like life begins conception except every life getting stimulus check? Cmon u/JayInslee allow 25% capacity Washington I'm pretty sure one. That's *maybe* positive thing shit pickle I'm there. people think covid hoax. decision right make. think knew since 20-40% people get wrecked virus (at least short term) worst public deniers coin flip chance get immediately suffer. time see least 20-40% get blasted though, that. smattering complications mild cases display later, that's like rolling really low 20 sided die means assholes like good chance luck out. good chuck probably see inside ICU least. Man, God Karma. wish I'd one last meal eat hot pot place, and/or gorged local ""Japanese Chinese Super Buffet.""

I mean... tiny selfish thing something enjoyed prior I'm really sad may never happen again. Yes Hey screwed Sweden know it. neighboring countries handled much better things starting look pretty good now. Can't happy good news gloat past mistakes?

I could say thing US currently experiencing second way might well overtake us deaths per capita. something I'm happy about? course not. want whole thing world back normal. Biden wins institutes national mask mandate national lockdown.  yikes, makes 100% certain numbers made up? whats source? Fox News? OAN? never heard Krogers names. one? agree. Leaders politicians bear greater responsibility ordinary citizens, especially disenfranchised ones woman almost certainly is. Still, absolve person moral responsibility. Choices still consequences. Even daily death rates higher neighbors, achieved herd immunity, death rates 4 half times higher nearest neighbors combined. better, countries while, USA somewhat exception, altho death rate still lower overall.

 Rinderpest sounds like series Netflix. Roughly 70% cure versus 45% cure, also 35% side effects versus 8% side effects Whatever. want use sweden justify shit country. miss eating popcorn watching movie :( No... political nature all...

I seen anyone neighbors like three months I'm still sick everyone. Well least bit better flipping coin.  give CCP right lawfully hurt basic interests citizens? China country world constantly denies entry citizens. 

Also, quarantine facilities far hitting capacities. telling country able build hospital two weeks take care 8000 arrivals 4 months? Like 2000 Chinese per month arrived mainland past 4 months, 60 people per day. ""capacity"" China has? reasonable, thoughtful necessary flight controls. ridiculous policies like five-one hurts interests citizens ask, can't afford it. 

Why health still dependent paying middlemen copays? America, get fucking shit together. suppose... Though imagine catch covid bad reaction and/or accidentally kill someone close thousand times ever win lottery... Vaccine science deniers starting reach critical mass. going get much worse fools. free, perhaps large ""administrative fee."" Hey, let's let Ticketmaster distribute shots!

Fined jailed. rely Science people disciplined...thats Germany you...I always knew crises comes Germany best prepared tackle it.  Actually, realised got one thing wrong definition. IFR post-facto estimate made humans. actual fatality rate disease depends individual human system infected, conditon infected, treatment lack thereof applied, interventions applied on. IFR statistical estimate deaths per 100 infections, symptomatic not, mild severe, low infectious dose, high.

As such, IFR also fluid CFR, subject interventions too, addition seasonal weather, genetic, dietary fluctuationing parameters.

So said IFR statistical measure closer CFR true fatality rate disease, generally pretty difficult accurately predict calculate.

And, means IFR also reduced interventions like prophylactics, treatment, later, vaccines.

Edit: case reproduction number R. R0 reproduction number without interventions. R brought physical distancing, masks lockdowns. Quito July 22, 2020 11:18
 help Guayaquil Mayor's Office, 10 medical care stations installed difficult sectors Quito. 100 semi-hospital beds arrived Quito part donation Guayaquil Mayor's Office. mayor Quito, Jorge Yunda, present morning Wednesday, July 22, 2020, contingency strategy care neighborhood level patients respiratory symptoms associated covid-19. plan distribute aid arrived Monday night, July 20, Guayaquil, stop spread virus capital. Natalia Álvaro, coordinator health services management care assurance District Health Secretariat, indicated aid serve build 10 health stations (tents, stretchers, medical personnel, supplies ...) throughout entire city.

 Based epidemiological report, areas highest number infections selected. Guamaní, Quitumbe, Chimbacalle, Centro Histórico, Chillogallo, Belisario Quevedo Calderón. part strategy, 10 service stations built parishes located municipal educational centers Casas Somos sectors. Álvaro indicated territory analyzed decided enable stations points meet characteristics allow providing safe crowded care. part donation, 100 semi-hospital beds, 100 oxygen concentrators, 10,000 KN95 masks, 40 gallons alcohol, 1,000 robes 80,000 doses medication received, including tablets, capsules ampoules. material, triage points enabled aim identify positive cases covid-19 early, give respective medication patient finish treatment home, is, complying quarantine measures security home. 

Álvaro explained medication received donation use first level care territory, help hospitals become saturated. patient receives medication time avoid complications therefore less demand beds hospitalization Intensive Care Unit. part Guayaquil donation go Quito Solidario Care Center, located Bicentennial Park. strategy contemplates recruitment patients community symptoms related covid-19 necessary examinations tests, referred Care Center. way, approach community focused attention achieved. 

Each station four five stretchers, largest 10, Álvaro indicated attended outpatient basis. is, patient arrives, medical team values ​​him. laboratory tests time, necessary, images. way known entrance center warranted continue treatment home. worst case, network articulated admitted public hospital. patient demand exceeds capacity units, assessment made number stations increased. 10 health stations two triage tents doctors, nurses, auxiliaries specialized personnel psychologists. total 21 triage points enabled, two station, three point greatest demand. estimated even laboratory technologists take samples, service gradually implemented. Álvaro clarifies matter hospitalization, observation points. is, patients stay maximum eight hours, prolonged evaluation necessary. Observational medical treatment involves taking vital signs, seeing patient difficulty breathing fever subside medication. 

The stations attend Monday Friday, 08:00 16:30. Álvaro insists dynamic strategy advance according epidemiological reports. words, points implemented depending needs community. Part strategy arrive, second stage, brigades community, medical personnel deployed territory identify cases covid-19, monitor isolation. stations, doctor evaluate patient, necessary, respective test performed. second phase, brigades go neighborhoods, taking tests massive. sanitize groceries bringing house. pain ass want COVID jackass like this. seems like desperate reach good news? virus body matter kill part that's mouth? read story, YouTube stars really make (notice say earn) enough money afford mansion? ALSO, jobs available unreasonably difficult, industries workload surged. they’re paying more, that’s sure. remember reading Sweden facing economic downturn similar neighbors, deaths basically benefits. fact spamming message again? Thanks LA! did.

Read report SARS-1. transmission rate. average though Americans aren’t poor. Americans highest median income (after taxes) world. America high inequality high poverty, average American rich compared rest world. little data it’s crazy. One little paper said probably cause 100 outlets reported like fact. it’s cause would mean young people hardly spread disease since 1,000s able gather streets cause infections. would great sign 1,000s people gathering streets screaming air exact opposite lockdown, since caused spike guess we’re good open back drink special juice everyday, cured... That’s annoying aspect this. healthcare workers ones pay price handle load caused ineptitude lawmakers. Lawmakers make choices move lives citizens healthcare professionals pay price foot bill damage causes. look Florida, DiSantis gets go home everyday without care world hospital workers citizens struggle due (lack a) response. Terrified they'd throw out, probably. Everything comes poo

 title sucks, read paper cite data conclusions got mutilated made title open mouths try throw in! cost astronomical people charge give bid sweetheart deals friends. That's get housing complex Santa Monica Blvd Weho costs $700,000 per unit housing first initiative. need sought real estate city? Fucking insanity. Build giant complex Victorville send there. mean? India managed control outburst initially unfortunately impossible keep economy shit indefinitely. start opening things country like India impossible contain virus. concept social distancing. no

Republicans believe shit poor minorities need money. need money Dems get something that's rightfully Yes, regenerative therapies used things like cartilage regrowth/repair joints, im sure things. Personally Ive never saw patient get didnt appear well off.  We’ve ‘pray COVID away’ ‘bleach COVID away’. Bolsonaro brings ‘false-negative COVID away’...

What next? loved Fine, explain lack covid surge NY, MA, PA, ME. still respond personal attacks besides point out. hate brag predicting since mid-late Jan. May rest peace. point, really “new” strand? feel like I’ve hearing one months. course, end day made decisions.

But want people stop making decisions, need give reasonable alternatives. every couple months going lockdown?  need start charging people. don’t disclose HIV/AIDS sexual partners. give something compare west, insane 27,544/km^(2) (though admittedly NYC much Manhattan, averaging 10,636/km^(2)). average 5,666/km^(2) come, go Disney something... stay there. wondering, certain numbers (80k cases) really happened China? want downplay anything happening US (why would I, I'm Europe), I'm wondering. matter people find fault. Please remember CDC also flip flopped masks. gotta start letting stupid people die. I've seen vaccine booster shots probably will. said, requiring two booster shots means less people end properly vaccinated. Especially poorer countries.  think first time age follow politics 2000 election.. Al Gore vs George Bush.. Jeb Bush governor Florida, created ballot illegal design caused lot people trying vote Gore vote third party candidate.. top lot votes thrown out.. Gore lost Florida small number votes lost election due it.. thing seemed pretty openly rigged grew adulthood faith election process. Cue panic buying empty shops. think need think “shut _everything_ down” little comprehensively Probably. marshmallow test without drawbacks (someone lacks trust people, example due upbringing precarious circumstances eat marshmallow right might otherwise disappear) help find can't delay gratification. let virus spread, grow exponentially end always outrun test capacity. imperial system measurements idiotic, illogical, there's valid argument defend existence. correlation diarrhea COVID-19? grandpa tested positive yesterday symptom told diarrhea. Fuck online learning

Comes HS student immensely disappointed zoom learning; expect much, worth time ultimately feel like learned anything worth much law classifies deaths result behaviour, anyone same, second degree murder. mean third? Maybe used one broken Drive Test sites? Idk lf aware happend there? soo many seem still missunderstanding this. voting , voting Even city variable. husband got tested county site (AA center) that's PCP sent him. got symptoms 2 days later, got tested another site. results came back 12 hours later. husband's took week. Dallas, seemed things control governor ruled county judge overstepped order masks close restaurants bars. Today looks like going bad day Japan. numbers prefectures indicate may 700 new infections nation wide. would huge spike since lifted state emergency. I've enough lockdown šhit, plan live normal human life. I'd wear masks socially distance, another stay-at-home next half year (or anywhere beyond) hard me. Thanks coming TED talk.

Take chicken pox vaccine. herd immunity, practically soon children born might catch chicken pox. vast majority people around immune. benefitted Herd Immunity -- dramatically slowed transmission.

You brought measles. quote Wikipedia Herd immunity recognized naturally occurring phenomenon 1930s observed significant number children become immune to measles, number new infections temporarily decreased, including among susceptible children.

Trump 2020

Michigan Trump

Gen Z Trump

People brain Trump They’re currently producing vaccine right now, really big gamble since don’t know next stages results look like, it’s good it’ll great payoff. They’re saying everything goes according plan vaccines available September earliest, probably means October. wouldn’t surprised health care workers vaccinated November good portion vulnerable late November.

Edit: I’m talking live Canada, prime minister already ordered supplies needed vaccinate everyone twice ( including vaccine itself) Probably unexpected rise pneumonia deaths. 

/s used John Hopkins data, hit 4,000,000 July 23rd. :-O fucking decade 1963 vaccine became available, nearly children got measles time 15 years age. estimated 3 4 million people United States infected year. Also year, among reported cases, estimated 400 500 people died, 48,000 hospitalized, 1,000 suffered encephalitis (swelling brain) measles.""

Apparently herd immunity means something different y'all. Overshoot mean individuals susceptible get it. 

There's basis idea much population resistant disease. least became pandemic first place months. Trump pump markets much thats real reason coronavirus breifings coming back. many reports state vaccine could months away. shit Well, happened?? much winning today's latest report state: http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/state_reports_latest.pdf

Gates Foundation works fight malaria parasitic diseases developing world.

But note qualifiers. limited resources own. research labs. can't respond resources like pre-Trump CDC + organizations 2014 Ebola.

And clear, conservative people fixation fomites hand-washing early days Covid-19.

Think organization primarily facilitates networking groups actually work, come closer understanding role global health. Yes, people seem forget ideological alliances (and wars) still thing. really don’t understand don’t know single person contracted virus. Hell don’t even know someone knows someone. Yet people seem surrounded people infected/ died.

I don’t mean downplay virus it’s truly difficult grasp scale thing know 0 people Texas avg 100 people per square mile new york state 339 average per square mile. Huston 3886 per square mile New york city avg population per square mile 27 THOUSAND per square mile. Yeah.. there's going difference. think sort grammatical rule surrounding interject -fucking- word. Em-fucking-barrassing seems proper form, embarr-fucking-issing least. Trump Michigan 10k votes last time. Unfortunately many black voter probably dying white boomers I'd imagine virus deaths place like Michigan probably effect election. him, person, no. even formal role CEO. company CEO for, aware CEO company separate entities? can't get claims right you? virus participated European tour group,also bought business class ticket.

Does virus stick work vacation take vacation work?Is corruption plague company?

To continued. *did try bombing it?* Thank you, funniest thing I've seen week. another 10% education, another 10% science/research/NASA.

You might like paying taxes, gotta, might well invest instead blowing it.   [Got updated graph look trend line like told instead individual days like told to, see seven day moving average *consistently* going since low average roughly 500 deaths per day. averaging 800 per day.

That statistically significant increase 60% *sustained* increasing trend last three weeks. reported, late worldometer's count. 49 new deaths. Olympics become super corrupt way shovel money towards well connected corporations. Thankfully lot cities begun wise up. smartest financial move Japan could would cancel today permanently. money spent gone. point throwing away good money. Welcome politics 101 *in Islamic calendar  I’d gone em-fucking-barrassing, honestly, like more. Get used ~1k deaths day foreseeable future. 

There isn’t slowing cases. It’s, best, staying 60-70k per day.


Until see dropping case numbers again, won’t see dropping death numbers. Yeah halt test, cases numbers go way zero! work tell you!

[See testing site close, health care workers Well yeah useless bio-weapon USA anyway That's actually something wonder, too. read story someone asymptomatic developed significant lung damage. experienced symptoms nothing prompted get checked out. common case, happening. 

The information around question flimsy best, observed asymptomatic carriers suffer organ damage. Really, virus like playing game Russian roulette. really consistency understanding virus understanding general level. 

We even look patients diagnosed HIV. longer takes person get tested medicated, impact disease person's body. people HIV positive never experience symptoms. find years later carriers virus. That's important know HIV status positive, start life-saving medication sooner. 

But even then, understanding virus infancy. could asymptomatic carrier, right now, hospital officials still going recommending people simply monitor symptoms stay home going hospital, like person even know body torn apart COVID realize disease body, really time being, best thing could stay negative.

I'll eat downvotes, that's okay. Reddit put comment posting cooldown (seemed weird 2 comments spaced out). Please engage thoughtful, non-hostile discussion

If could point towards articles merit describing research behind them, I'd like check out. history personality research, mostly survey based skews actual results. words, people tend report behavior differently actually engage behavior, makes results inherently biased. data survey data, basing personality traits verbal reports alone, makes data invalid, thus nonscientific. Either way, Reddit hive reporting concepts scientific merit behind them, I'd especially interested checking expand knowledge. Remember, science deductive process based observable phenomena. academics put fancy terms stats behind concept mean scientific. skeptical everything  can't hold 90 minutes, see doctor. Dumb fuck people large exhibit following (generally close all) qualities:

Selfishness, stupidity, ignorance, narcissism, hatefulness, fearfulness. Private companies announce profit crisis. Scrum par course people power they’ll anything keep it, especially person like Trump heard covid thing? Might pretty serious... saw someone suggest putting strip medical tape along top mask face. Maybe help? go? sanitizer, cloth masks wash lot. Yo real. took ""aging communities"" seminar grad school eye opening. much shit even think of. remember presentation specific intersection happened near live many elderly folks injured last years like, NEVER single thought intersection. everything, one traffic light. really poor way get message out. know journal article published worth sharing, recent one study people wear masks. Throwing diagnosis narcissism face anti-mask crowd going make wear masks. Claiming people wear masks higher IQ better around people might (such stretch, know) make moment self realization. I’m predicting argue remain indecisive way another shutdown.  reasonable question. virus getting weaker reason think is.

Meanwhile way back started people conservative thinktanks pushed idea virus would spontaneously weaken.

I note answer reasonable question note others did.

Also 2 me, downvoted hell upvoted much.

edited add: bouncing -2 2 me, mildly downvoted.  “Daddy’s always said wear mask. don’t know didn’t, l b r d! You’re reasons things bad!”

Or something like that. think mix I'm sure there's least 9/11 worth people 35 40 died USA COVID.

And discount obese, diabetic, elderly, ""near-death already"" etc. 9/11 death toll, maybe we're 2x 9/11. 

That's right, 1,822. (I joke) don’t feel great it... would I? you’re actually performing worthwhile exercise there. You’ve diagnosed timeline total number potential dead. course 100% population get disease virus cycles population harder time spreading leads 60-65% herd immunity number. total max number deaths using figure around 1.2 - 1.3 million without vaccine improved therapeutics change assumptions.

So yea, I’m taking information hand projecting likely probable sharing information people idea expect. 

Your timeline exercise also lead statistic projects much time develop vaccine save lives many lives could potentially saved time vaccine developed.

Edit: good news, used .6% mortality rate numbers, adjust .25% mortality total estimate deaths fall around 495k. honestly feel might realistic number. Hahahahahaha! brilliant probably true.  Yet! probably none die. someone die long term/permanent organ damage? 

This disease mess body many ways. basically put 16 people risk. deserves jail! American *Conservative* lies. push universal healthcare impossible it’s communism. Yet Paul Rand Republican, needed surgery went Canada get it. 
They wear hypocrisy like badge honor. need stop comparing US 1st world countries lmao  expect 'work starve' options top need 3 times rent monthly income rent place

What's problem this? ensures rent property financially suitable position so. good landlord also stops people putting risky financial situation. got tested 6th, get results till 21st. Feel free source outrageous claim.  could get permanent damage could perfectly healthy like majority COVID 19 survivors. Trump Loves religion. cleared heathens church prove love devotion Christ. even teargas dropped blasphemous priests let heathens soil hallowed grounds. Visit r/COVID19 u prolly find something Great another mixed message. single rather standart surgery single night hospital?
When day night hernia sides (endoscopic surgery , dunno thats right term) dont think paid anything... well parking... 

So straight cost insurance? teacher, want say shitty us, too. one weekend prepare change. classroom runs like well oiled machine years teaching grade, totally revamp every piece instruction less week's notice without real support training. Also, district, allowed grade anything equity concerns. able sit support children day, students never logged on, daycare relatives, little support general. elementary level, way, students wholeheartedly teaching since August, crushing everything come screeching halt. get tired seeing comments like ""the teacher even grade anything!"" control like either. upsetting. People think (as far know) kids going come physically okay they're risk. 

But risk. Even physical, danger grief, heartbreak, upheaval lives. many children bereaved year been.  brother came back vacation, international flight, informed company. wanted know required quarantine, said, ""nah, cone back work"" 24 hours came back US. companies give fuck. 20 pounds six months reasonable.From nutrition course took years ago college, taught safe weight loss 1-2 pounds body fat (about 1 kg) per week. Since 1 gram fat yields 9 kcal (in US, ""9 calories""), means caloric deficit 4500 - 9000 kcals per week (650 - 1300 kcal per day). Losing 1 pound body fat dieting possible (e.g. cut 1 daily soft drink 20% way daily goals), obviously increase physical activity well, many calories cut reduced.

Morbidly obese persons treat weight like treat kitchen sink bathroom shower - far gone gotta wait becomes real problem act. little daily maintenance, problem gradually disappear.

I really need clean fucking dishes. wish family best well, thank you. Waves really make sense case since new areas hitting peaks. resurgense New York point would second wave. Responsible governments (i.e. US) forced sooner later make impossible choices. Lockdows panacea many countries enough ""flatten"" curve costs tremendous, economy (which malls bars) society general.

For example, many countries, children without schools half year already. Medical treatments suspended. Grandparents isolated. Etc. 

The Swedish tried something different. thought could manage it, clearly variables complex paid price human lives. certain took serious approach situation countries, anyway commendable. People medical dietary requirements food allergies die, guess. flu killed 620,467 people 4 months? Wait.. Spanish flu! Let’s take look second. Spanish flu killed 50 million people world wide 2 years. Studies done survivors Spanish flu discovered babies exposed (in utero) increased risk heart attack, flu pandemic 20% increased risk. Doctors dubbed people “flu babies”. 

* Men born pandemic shorter average.

* Children born flu pandemics higher rates physical disability, perform worse academic tests lower income compared babies born pandemics.

* babies born mothers Spanish flu greater chance serious mental disorders. Many developed schizophrenia. ( http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1929814,00.html )

According John Hopkins University, Flu kills 650,000 calendar year.. we’re almost since March Covid19. Covid19, Lesser known symptoms popping like, infertility, covid toe, brain damage, Kawasaki‘s disease children, inflammation organs, liver failure.. last time checked flu none symptoms. keeps going way, Covid19 could worse Spanish flu terms symptoms time.

Anyways. stated many scientists healthcare experts. Covid19 flu. It’s contagious virus, it’s brand new little known won’t know another 100 years “covid babies” grow studies done.. you’d like risk infertility complications, go right ahead. I’d really advise educating history infectious disease though! Ohio. It’s revealed much wish never seen. sounds like multiple adults children. baffles people still think death count numbers accurate... 1 million infected lead 100k deaths, suddenly 3 million increase leads 40k deaths even tho measures prevent virus less worst, yeah, seems reasonable.  business owners check currency see counterfeit not? 

Why business owners require shirt shoes local health regulations? Name another country then? Shit even Vietnam destroyed covid masks. Vietnam 2, USA 0 China /s right thing. 

That’s thing sucks it. hate hearing someone know might I’ve around them, knowledge exposed responsibility get checked warn others. Granted, I’ve working home since March isolating much possible since I’m due baby two weeks, still sucks. People weird mixture caring ton caring all, many family members one side conspiracy theory group sure I’d get ridicule them. logistics conducting analyzing thousands upon thousands test per day easy printing money know of. already lot mutations going on. Williamson county here. husband's aunt wedding private marina Pickwick state park July 18. go 185 invited. seen pictures Facebook one careful.

Oh, HALF LUNG REMOVED six years ago due lung cancer. 50's, smokes many friends boat. mil furious irresponsible can't make people listen take seriously. Darwinism finest.

Edit: spelling SB County here, im board. OC LA close comfort go outside. Theres much cross travel counties, me, numbers numbers. Granted live Inland empire SB County huge. third us food/housing insecure though. Meaning job loss ending social program would mean starvation homelessness almost immediately. [And nearly 80% report living paycheck without savings assets float times like these. 20% wants blame situations, that's reality wages blue collar jobs keep rising cost housing, education healthcare. crowded living situations become norm takes multiple salaries make rent put food table. Source? Hadn’t heard (Jealous crying) 😭 problem, sure, I'm saying otherwise. I'm getting focus specific metric. Thanks satan buddy get tested? feeling sick? so, it’s going work feeling sick. Nope, assume none capable critical thinking called selfish going hike someone day. honestly wonder staying inside months end getting crowd making irrational. long wear mask avoid high risk places like bars, gyms, amusement parks, indoor dining, really isn’t bad go out. Trevor CDC? ones used Labcorp Qwest? CDC tests? somebody else’s? 16 roommates?! Wtf?? think risk low work without mask wiped everything clean first one else there. mask needed scenario make workout much harder.  Well recommended past, didn’t heed recommendation one went hospital, know got tested wanted know required job, right? clarifying point here: study excess deaths, death might counted casualty COVID. However, official recorded cause death would COVID; would probably blunt force trauma due motorcycle crash (or something like that). lot people confusing point, driving conspiracy theories doctors falsely recording cause death hospitals ""get money way"". hope also validating fear concerns, thoughtful conversations around balance importance income necessity survival. It’s real phrase  Blame never left china. 100% responsible this.  yet Astrazeneca it.

You know damn well assholes make dose $25 charge $10k it. It’s modus operandi. That's great know! can't abide abuse corruption government anymore. fact take care people makes incredibly sad. I'm lucky enough I've able take care family, want live place actually seems care citizens. like Sweden elderly dying nursing homes, country all. count Sweden remove elderly care deaths compare every country (including elderly care deaths reason). New Mexico wait line day get results two three days. Whose statehouse makes remarkable difference shit gets bad. honest comparing single country US kind stupid. It’d fair compare US european countries together instead.

Remember, US made states state less country rules makes sense would much harder pandemic rest world population mostly it’s hard make states unify common cause.

Example: civil war northern states southern states FFCRA addressed leave grants 80 hours sick time (does need accumulated) businesses &lt;500 employees.

Waiting test counts towards need quarantine afterwards suspect might enough get test, anything beyond discretion employer. makes think first places outbreaks virus populations elderly people largely mobile traveling?

This idea virus got vulnerable population first, spread active, mobile, traveling people bit illogical. Yes! Yes! Feel hate. 

Does schadenfreude get hard? it? Pathetic. prediction, California see 50% deaths NYC (let alone state NY). New York closed late little protect vulnerable. Everyone else learned that, rather order make feel better. Please add BREAKING headline

Metaphorically, course. reminds kind discussion say want to
Put condom /s article, sorry give 5minutes so. west nile virus offensive? would say people need ask would pay full tuition online course. assume many would not. 

Then need ask wouldn’t. It’s taking long NC SC, especially people testing something like CVS instead doctor. people know get positive results back 14-day quarantine over. It’s mess! . . . 56% people asked . . . **some** Really sorry. used better. somewhat better places. can’t wait share FB...  Could worse. Way early China said reinfection worse small lump palm. went hand specialist xrayed. says likely cyst, get MRI. xray doctors visit $1200, MRI would take 5000$ deductible. havent MRI.

US healthcare basically calculation serious issue going cost, order determine whether go doctor not. ""Let's give time see gets better own"" Americans primary healthcare. Good point. Governments misalocate money. stop giving them. interested table/document sort lists dates brought details country shut-downs (ie, closed restaurants, limited groups x people, reopened x%, etc etc) possible metrics used make decisions. I've seen information discussed news articles hoping comprehensive list done. anyone source something like that?

I'm interested following countries: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Vietnam. one woman lives hour away city tested positive 10 times, isolated 50 days still tested positive. Human beings obsession identity. face huge part identity. people identified masks ""other side"" wears. wear mask, even though irrational misguided, feel wearing enemy flag face, morally abhorrent. 

To say simply idiots would really missing point. say ""making political"" also entirely accurate. bring politics mask. feel like *their identity erased* mask. I'm trying laugh values really truth. thing explains irate violent people getting. 

Some cultures also value individualism cultures (high mask compliance Asian countries others) may believe displaying ""choice individual."" there's many layers point toward personal cultural identity. (They literally feel erased, extremely dramatic overreactive ask me! There's lot fear focus ""erasure"" many cultures.)

There anti maskers world last pandemic. particular problem exacerbated seems like kind identity politics. possible mutation, accounted for? Tragic. gone BLM protests instead. ""Science"" proven social gatherings problem result transmission. science! much adore want adore years come possible

That's really lovely way put it. Take care first. State exactly son, stress takes it. Sounds like he's brainwashed media even though might b*tchy precautions, he'll glad years gotten family enjoy normalcy together. Stay strong! informally supposed guy helping keep President line.

That worked out. Nah tree fiddy Literally every 1st term elected official primarily interested reelection. marked positive news? 

Those 49 less 1% mortality rate. Even California massive spike COVID 19 cases, massive spike COVID 19 deaths good thing.

Glad see California good job protecting elderly vulnerable catching virus. even read comment, knew AZ. 

Please call/email/tweet local representatives news outlets. way going get thru understand backlogged tests are. We’re likely around 100k queue right now. stealing data pharmaceutical companies good thing. 
 
that shit protected, fucking medicine. nobody rights medicine. No, 80 median age, meaning every death 80 there's one 80. dead 60, sure, normal die 65, instance. dangerous media wants us believe

I remember media saying 10% death rate...  Remind friends clothe, shelter, feed dead. minimum, expect majority survived severe cases probably never rejoining workforce meaningful way. yet unknown percentage cases go develop ME/CFS definitely ever returning work, probably ever. uh conspiracy. pretty well known happening every major country world. quick google news source China Uyghurs yield hundreds results.  


Either grossly unaware whats going world, shilling China. Sweden also deaths per capita 6 nations (and two micronations).

But make rather well things considered. unlikely approach would worked like elsewhere. Except anecdotal evidence hasn’t happened.

And even does, bad second time get it? awe infection lad. somehow justifies infecting ten people knowingly? know big epidemiology? She’s infected around fifty people primary secondary infections. Probably couldn’t reach 16 them. say capitalism wasn’t flawed? bafoon. he’s board?!. again, would let children anywhere near man. 100% Hispanic Indeed does, lot folks this, clearly divulges quick respond....but quick listen. Use brain, know lot ask, try Billy. read?  Alex, Marty rest gang happy America face charges that? ""Dead end alley""?

How pronounce cul de sac English? it? Wuhan, Lombardy, NY.

Everybody knew happen, still seems incredibly difficult act responsible stop spread.

All best healthcare staff. take hydroxychloroquine, actually. seem helped settled debate didn't. Forget popcorn, get toilet rolls makes even *worse* resources knowhow far best. History, likely history, going judge certain Americans harshly. reason 18-29 yr old fastest growing group positives. Large private gathering without mask. (Germany, Bavaria) strict still are, shop entered without masks, etc. entire district, (many towns etc) free new cases since 2-3 weeks kept careful. bars open, restricted everything. 


Idk US ( people get there, know everyone same) see link less cases masks. heck wrong wearing one. colorful designs, pretty things. breathe perfectly fine too. ffs. That's fine, take average salary account, need spend much per head capita. average Swiss salary minimum wage much higher states.

It's currently 1.08 United States Dollar Swiss Franc, minimum wage 20 CHF lot higher American minimum. Plus average salaries almost careers far higher US equivalent.

This equates much robust set social safety nets compared US. 

Then compare country deals health insurance, see *stark* differences. Swiss system one hell lot better. universally tied career low income get much cheaper rates. kind country left crippling debt audacity get cancer.

Both countries tax rates almost identical, there's much used highlight differences safety nets tax perspective apart Swiss tax used prop-up healthcare, US, not.  8.25 years pregnant. That's pregnancy that's jail term. kinds people need locked cell. Spanish flu took Brazilian president time, history may still repeat 13 days huh? Maybe something slow down. /s

THE BEST TESTING. BIG BEAUTIFUL BIGLY TESTING. best thing done now, since little late wont lockdowns enforce social distancing person responding to, think insightful. actually probably *would* go maskless wore Klucker Neo-Gnatzi mask. Runs bit foul Poe's law immediately invoke Gnatzi's, good comparison. Logic's got nothing it.

The real question make identity first place. I'm pretty sure answer obvious. everyone's wearing masks go out, bunch friends/family hang home, somebody virus spreads rest them, go friends/family homes, virus keep spreading house house. Arizona's cases seems dropping wishful thinking part say Northeast like Europe, American individualism still part culture, I'd say we're closest could probably get America right now. article right, NE densely populated (a lot closer Europe regard well), likely give shit neighboring city/county/state somewhere that's spread out. We're close truly good mitigating neighbor. also closed longest severely, even personally know someone affected covid, likely affected way shut downs. I'd much rather play rules see another three months sitting inside going insane.

While seeing level growth NE, think fact governors/mayors quick react repeal opening steps goes show going welcome second wave willingly. need get fuck California trying cram 16 people 1480 square feet.

And get California dirt poor resources travel move another state? Hey, I’m American I’m willing pay vaccine. I’m willing pay family protection virus.

I’m willing pay mine, would mean families can’t afford pay could get one free vaccines. ya people wearing people like numb nuts. problem feasible, person state fine. pandemic seems America problem self isolating, wearing mask, putting human beings danger. Scientists told do. majority Europe proven science correct. Americans still bleating vaccines cause autism, idea going vaccine completed.... rest assured Americans leaving shores. Meanwhile Bolsonaro Boris still around Definitely. Even ignore states clearly trying suppress total number deaths. pandemic completely new disease natural would take months even years get really accurate count. *To day* really guess number people died 1918 Flu epidemic. Even places *tried*to inflate stats reason, overall picture would almost certainly worse see months this. Pssh, expect do, read article?? Yeah currently less less people dying this, thats good thing. enthusiasm hazard pay gone drain...

I would rather get catapulted Mitch’s bedroom point

Typical. true literally every country since beginning, yes. think florida reporting much less positive cases hit ceiling testing capacity. super long lines get test states takes weeks get results. getting results, things probably much much worse. actually reading article (ok, skimming) seems anti microbial coating. 
Meaning, anything stuck mask would killed / deactivated.  
The problem mask job capturing microbes breathe in, type solution really add anything value average person. 
Sure, could deactivate virus dislodges mask inhaled. 
Also, could prevent people transferring virus hand (when adjusting mask) mucous membrane. 

So, isn’t bad development, I’m overly excited it. feeling would spun like actually transcribed question asked answer gave one see (if able read Swedish) fake news.

First, reporter saying Fanny Westling Aftonbladet, jag har en fråga till folkhälsomyndigheten  jo, det har varit en debatt de senaste dagarna mellan liksom Norge och Sverige hur man hanterat pandemin och med den anledningen eh så vill jag ställa en fråga nämligen det att era norska kollegor varnar nu ju för att Norge kan behöva stänga ner igen till hösten när skolor och allting kommer igång och då undrar jag om ni tror att Sverige är bäst bättre rutta rustade inför hösten än Norge

&amp;#x200B;

Anders Tegnell's det beror lite på vad du menar med bättre rustade, det, vi har väl alla , tror jag alla länder, blivit bättre rustade på att hantera det här för vi har ju lärt oss en hel del, vi har ju blivit bättre på att se till att det finns lager när det gäller skyddsutrustning och sådant och där är det väl inga stora skillnader Däremot så tror jag att vi skulle har det lite enklare hösten än man har det Norge för de åtgärder som vi har första hand bakfickan å vidta är åtgärder som redan är på plats som är lätta att uppgradera ytterligare något å därför skulle det inte bli så drastiska förändringar som det blir ett land som Norge där man tänker sig stänga skolor, stänga verksamheter, det får ju väldigt stora konsekvenser så på det sättet så tror jag att vi eh förhoppningsvis kommer lindrigare undan om man får ett liknande scenario Sverige och Norge med återigen ökande antal fall för att vårt hela upplägg är mindre dramatiskt på många olika sätt Sen är det ju så att det är ju betydligt fler personer som Sverige som är immuna än vad man är Norge och det spelar ju också roll förstås, även om någon total flockimmunitet tror jag inte vi har och det kanske vi aldrig kommer uppnå för att sjukdommar försvinner sällan på det viset. Men vi ligger helt klart uppe på de nivåerna så att det har en väldigt stor betydelse och den stora minskningen som vi ser väldigt snabbt nu talar ju väldigt starkt för att vi har en ganska stor immunitet befolkningen som gör att smittspridningen tillsammans med allting annat vi gör tillsammans faktiskt hålls tillbaks och att vi ligger kvar på den nivån hela tiden så det tror jag gör att vi kommer förmodligen lindrigare undan, jag skulle kanske inte orden att vi är bättre rustade, men jag tror vi kommer lindrigare undan om vi får nya &lt;ohörbart höst.

&amp;#x200B;

So asked Sweden better prepared, says no, want say that, given already restrictions place Norway said would close schools happen again, get similar outbreak countries less disruptive us already lockdown mode. article makes want punch goddamn air It’s uncanny accomplish you’ve already taken 30% population susceptible pool. cry now?

that plus mandatory masks month closed airports borders... somehow poland never even first wave... 

only issue arising since people getting sloppy thinking it’s over. lived pretty much dead on. dad's diagnosed NPD. clearly deludes believing whatever necessary maintain view fits world. Everything reaction non-existent threats views himself.

Americans fed idea individualism long, idea ""You can't tell do!"" become mantra large segment population.

Which exacerbates problem outline, personal identity. People see orders wear mask infringing individual choice, associate wear masks ""the other"" trying force identity them.

It's really frustrating people wired need resisting *what's best everyone* order satisfy desire shape themselves. used AA artillery kill virus. Yeah, definitely possible somebody could born poverty expensive area means move away. poor absolutely poor people's fault conscious choice.

There's way that's right. multiplying NYC population, NYC population ages 0-17. Yes, very, uncommon discovery invalidate entire fields science, least last 200 years. That's ghosts real would do, last logic, every scientist religious belief less credible atheist scientists?

The upside couple weeks seeing anymore - except visiting hours. I'm nephew Boy Scouts summer activities cancelled. least groups taking right approach. Science respecting Ohioan here.

Just spent time I’d like admit looking twitter comments Dewine’s Mandate post. Given twitter isn’t great place find intelligent discourse still disappointed many people openly mocking science masks well “unconstitutional” “communist” tropes. 

I near-zero faith majority Americans adhere anything would require consider anyone themselves. become nation selfish, entitled, ignorant intolerant people. It’s disgusting sad.

Fingers crossed though!  indeed I'm conflating anything, looking clarity. think interpretation Virginia's laws correct either, say ""Virginia law preventing employers requiring employee join union"" explain *any.* confusing everyone.  think Highway Hell would appropriate song. Even bacteria caused bubonic plague still persists. rare treatable antibiotics. Depends long term effects, horrendous patients. Chronic fatigue, lung tissue scarring, loss taste/smell, also neurological effects turning up. barely data yet, patients still issues months later.

We still clue virus going body long term. illnesses found effects years later, appeared relatively harmless first (Hey, sniffles two weeks) turned quite malicious. saw post. love husband's idea think similar idea used countries-- read somewhere Finland? Denmark? moved classes libraries public buildings get space need.

I also teach high school doubt relatively show highest risk environment. Yet HS kids need *in* school reasons younger students do. 

I'm really, really, tired people citing places opened without also talking local positivity rates fact Government stepped provided resources timely way. know evolving science presented challenges, spike wish happening, could foresee problems, could they. China, Finland, Iceland, Australia, S. Korea managed find enough resources, can't we?

How country continue call richest nation earth can't find money darkest times? course teachers wondering better times-- long time. ok, sure ignore France 500 active outbrakes Spain 200. Also ignore Spain taking harsher measures France is. No. relying treatments vaccines, need effective public health protocols — good manners; proper equipment like face masks, safety harnesses, seatbelts; etc — proper city/social design. disagree this, lol. completely different NZ did.

That’s doubling far I’m concerned. Perhaps math gives rosier numbers lol mean, would say I’m wrong, wore extra piece cloth face months however long takes. biggie. anti-maskers wrong, contributed spread dangerous disease possibly spread somehow died it. understand parents (especially parents living COVID hotspot) would send kids summer camps time like this. tell you, kids think worst parent year taking theme parks, sending camps, allowing hang friends. hoping older, thank still alive would alive take care think claim escaped Lab. thing made lab seems get conflated far often reason.

However number prominent virologists said believe chinese messing virus lab created conditions leap human public.

Scientists thrown number theories alternative sources. However saying ""There evidence lab source.!"" really provide much evidence come lab. evidence pangolin theory correct. evidence explination. none. China let anyone anyone wants talk west rounded arrested. speculation conjecture.

50cent army working overtime suggest claims escaped lab ""It created kill people depopulate.!"" conflating two attempt discredit anyone asking questions.

And taking doctor Shi's word specific strain among many coronavirus strains lab ain't gonna cut scientific proof there. they're arresting people trying leave country proof coverup person person transmition..  *Dr* Li Meng-Yan escaped exposed China Lied. Dr Li Wenliang colleague died hospital first vanished forced apologize retract statements.

We absolutely zero evedence anything except coverup wonder people throwing theories. Especially university Viroligy institute studies stuff city poo hit fan.  Yeah, like lot places seen, especially can't guarantee proper distancing.

Background Emergency Department (ED) attendances fallen across UK since ""lockdown"" introduced 23rd March 2020 limit spread coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). hypothesised reductions would vary patient age disease type. examined pre- in-lockdown ED attendances two COVID-19 unrelated diagnoses; one likely affected lockdown measures (gastroenteritis) one likely unaffected (appendicitis).

Methods Retrospective cross-sectional study conducted across two EDs one London hospital Trust. compared adult paediatric ED attendances, (January 2020) lockdown (March/April 2020). Key patient demographics, method arrival discharge location compared. used SNOMED codes define attendances gastroenteritis appendicitis.

Results ED attendances fell 1129 per day lockdown 584 in-lockdown; 51.7% pre-lockdown rates. In-lockdown attendances lowest under-18s (16.0% pre-lockdown). proportion patients admitted hospital increased 17.3% 24.0% proportion admitted intensive care increased four-fold. Attendances gastroenteritis fell 511 103; 20.2% pre-lockdown rates. Attendances appendicitis also decreased, 144 41; 28.5% pre-lockdown rates.

Conclusion ED attendances fell substantially following lockdown implementation. biggest reduction under-18s. observed reductions attendances gastroenteritis appendicitis. may reflect lower rates infectious disease transmission, though fall appendicitis-related attendances suggests behavioural factors also important. Larger studies urgently needed understand changing patterns ED use access emergency care COVID-19 pandemic. Also, actual numbers NYC probably *way* higher recorded, hit hard early testing capacity time even close enough keep it. Underrated comment right here. Thank you! It’s talking point it’s truth. Hope wearing mask. And? maybe generally avoid shitty people, ruin plenty times entire country terrible worth visiting 

???????????? 

????????????????????????? According Worldmeters, 2 million active cases US.

Those cases positive test results returned. backlog hundreds thousands positive tests processed yet. (Even deity waved magic wand eliminated coronavirus tonight, we'd still see positive cases reported next week so).

Also, people feel unwell, tested yet (or tested, think normal cold, they're afraid nasal swab, number reasons).

We also assume people symptomatic likely tested. 

So 2m known active cases, might 1.5m sympomatic known active cases.

Add another 500,000 positive tests waiting processed, maybe 375k feel unwell. 

Add unknown number people COVID feel unwell, tested yet tested. 

So, probably somewhere 2m 3m active symptomatic cases. family would cut forever visit amidst pandemic, bigger problems that. *sigh* realize ""late slow reaction"" decision made Sweden, right?

Pretty hard realize something that's false. I'll gladly await source backs up, ""late"" bit particular. whole problem enough contain virus.

The whole problem slow reaction

Princesses distanced vehicle plastic screens them, masked. human performers calvacades, dancing street front floats, masked. justify this? seems likely transmission go cast members higher rate guest transfer. 

But I’ve seen guests ignoring social distancing, crowding lines, crowding bottle neck areas small streets. It’s safe. ...prove did? Well, yeah. New High Score!

First time seeing California man it. almost always Florida man. air scrubbers find proper quality efficacy rooms 400-600 sq ft average? area general knowledge, thoughts multiple units certain positions depending layout space. think civilized world supports Israel. see agenda, trying make look like Israel preventing Palestinians testing covid. Given tremendous medical aid free care provided people hate Israel position appears dishonest say least.  Heroine They're beautiful, see them. Everyone says so. fact exactly? Cause science far settled. Something done back February. absurd evidence points suppression case numbers anything election year. One needs look exploding pneumonia deaths President saying asked testing slowed. one better, missing babyhood, missing rest life? number kids getting abused yearly around 700,000. That's lot more, accounting negligence, may even common. households struggle putting food table, supplying technology, providing stable learning environment abusive negligent. Especially today. Carlson losing advertising left right. indeed business rely ads. gearing opposition network. can't hit second wave never left first, smart thinking like guy car dealer explains warranty doesn’t cover repair tries extend warranty husband accidentally stockpiled (we bought huge amount toilet paper Amazon pre-pandemic, coincidence) looks like still 6 rolls left red cross also gave gift certificate redeem via one websites tons options. picked $10 amazon gift certificate. think thing lot people nowadays would rather go online complain (like us) go help people.

But there's still tons people every age hard work. can't generalize entire age ranges groups people, never really works.

It's like saying ""all millenials lazy spend much money coffee"". Transfered flow covid data directly himself, blamed cdc. Says wear masks best leader voice. Takes mask camera turns away. Numbers magically go zero weeks never come back.  Well called 1918 virus Spanish flu don’t see problem I'm sure majority families mothers working blacksmiths barbers. Ooooh shit cant possibly open types numbers. mid august likely 2500 day. dont see opening schools Americans generally give shit people community. comfort anyone else's cause ""it's free country anything say"". culture always selfish long get piece, cares? That's one part it. Factor fussy uncomfortable face mask initially optics wearing one, basically teenager throwing tantrum they're told something want to. America nutshell, we're still young growing country we're showing  need start treating narcissism quiet constant existential threat is. know exactly done them, treat seriously do. That's probably true moment. numbers new active infected rising faster cases resolving. Especially consider longer surge goes on, long term ICU patients hospitals saddled with. Meanwhile new cases keep pouring break, patients arriving hospital sicker they've putting care likely never got test results. think elections otherwise would done sooner, guess finally realized situation control, also since opponent Biden literally dementia creepy borderline pedo clips kids Trump probably going win.  active bball player this, barely jump trampoline now. I'm 37 healthy young age. fear covid end life. Apparently it’s form population control🤣🤒 ...And facts find duh.com. lie? Look damn graph.

You’re taking two weeks slight uptick suggest last 12 weeks severe downturn don’t matter.    Oh sure, let's go kill grandparents can't stand seeing year... democracy freedom protected, 144,000 sacrifice

Definitely worth recently go record saying Biden wins election, going consider accepting final results. Stupid man is, that's kind comment one makes unless there's kind talk going background. Republic votes citizens mean shit group find way justify ignoring national elections installing illegal president, GOP. People turning vote ight going accomplish shit country unless UN steps forcibly uphold integrity procedure (which really wish would. America proven screaming toddler incapable taking care itself. needs parental supervision.) think New Zealand would another country one best responses. According worldometers, 1 new case yesterday 1,555 cases total. acceptable number reopen schools. like city, 1,000+ new cases everyday 43,000 total cases still wanting reopen schools. one could’ve forseen (except obvious US even hit 100 cases that’s happened every place got hit earlier) 😔 new October Beijing military parade grandpa would ashamed parents. glad doesn’t see this. First thing said wife saw post “My Papa would freaking love story! God parents suck.” GOP trait cite graph proves deaths decreasing since April. California's numbers press daily. missing them, choose to. Oh see we’re hillary Y'all ever pass joint yourself? Japan 99% mask wearing. fun, games science one true negative breaches even kids live negligent households least die. Even though negligent household, eventually left old enough good mental health. parents recovered drug use made amends...... survived. jist feel like child dying vs neglected still chance live better life eventually better alternative least there's chance. Also funnily enough HCA majority companies founded Tennessee. Ooo wonder could Tennessee thing. Living florida kind like get car someone realize driver drunk theyre flying highway towards cliff 100 miles per hour you’re trapped obvious news ever posted sub. Ah, okay. Lets trust data multiple sources. comment so.

Youre right: One always skeptical data, manipulated paying data gathered. However, blindly disregard data equally dangerous blindly accepting it. Idk, could see higher lower reported now. sister high risk &amp; brain broke week COVID. trying get everyone family take seriously. made ton masks &amp; sent &amp; donated them. day two ago, said me, ""but percentages deaths, compared number cases going down."" speechless. may true (I honestly even care check), I'm terrified that's going ignore precautions &amp; get virus. acted like means end almost here. broken her. California's got Blue areas Red areas. thing is, since Obama left office Trump took number Democrats increased (in fact, slightly decreased), number Republican significantly decreased.

[People become Democrats, they've abandoned Trump, Well see exponential curve need act early, point it’s hard catch Dollar conversion looks right wow didn’t realize US Canada prison time conversion rates high. 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣 Karen’s world “gasped! request refund!” Pot meet kettle realize diarrhea since Easters?! really not. 

If know viruses like Common Cold, SARS, MERS likely know Coronavirus. Hospitals getting paid inflate body counts.  Cool, thanks sharing. paying white supremacists dress like ANTIFA members incite violence enough? Nope. talking single day stats. are.

I one pretending death number tomorrow thousand break trend. are.

I one providing 7 day moving average data eliminates day day statistical noise relying pretend trend place not.

Again, part confusing you?

Instead bringing bullshut, actually tell confusing fixed. obviously understand read graph trend line keep ignoring referencing day day numbers. problem? something else?  Lol that’s easy say looking back first get hit US made real here. Look states still today aren’t taking serious despite love sub god it’s gotten bad recently. Selfishness everywhere.

That’s usually 3 4 days. live Alabama. We. Are. Phucked. loud clear? think time outdoor helps. younger population getting it. theory lower viral loads make less severe. people distancing, wearing masks, outside means get it, dont get bad (just hypothesis) base don’t think COVID real.

I’ve heard it’s secretly designed cause cognitive decay offspring human races like Europeans Americans /s Bought $600 worth personal gym weights, barely scratched service, it’s expensive. Need get cage seats. #CALIproblems Yes claims quite strange. Hospitals would gotten hundreds patients hospitalized covid. write death covid gain another buck. Sure, think part may possible. 

The question then, means hospital deaths usa high % contributed covid then. u proof that? 

Your link testing positive rate still unrelated ur claim though. One testing one death. Funny people say ""Canada socialist healthcare wait months see doctor""...


Apparently for-money healthcare seems glitches... going casinos? supporters wanted run country like businesses. that. jail time.... reported human human transmission 20 January. China shut Wuhan 23 January. Long time ass. real test results friends made along way. Yes, can. frankly amazing medical system collapsed strain yet

Despite sub would believe, hospitals capacity vast majority country Yeah living Utah, weird &amp; sister. neighbors least 4-5 kids, more. (No joke.) Depends country effective they've controlling virus. Japan experiencing spikes recently, government simultaneously trying push domestic tourism. going well. case seems bit odd give exact number 95% across two factories.

This exactly mod agree 95, cited factory well countries 100% mask-wearing, probably loose, inexact figure. title communicate rather gave plainly/explicitly, marked misleading. reasonable question. virus getting weaker reason think is.

the person didnt know this. good question. especially considering death rate going much. likely isnt right, admonishing people's desire knowledge bad. Seen Event Without Mask Hours Saying It’s ‘Patriotic’ Wear One

Therefore Trump ain't patriotic, folks. America also preparing required hardware administer vaccine 

Yes are. literally making up. “System” Yes, agree. infuriates me. lacked National leadership. Trump couldn’t make decision wanted ride fence, deny science make himself. basically denied existence severity 9 months. always put ego country, re-election good country. So, without National rules, without compensation economic recovery, it’s every city, town, school district, business, man themselves. me, I’m going back quarantine mode.  easily identifiable though since accidental death counted. source decrease accidental deaths? current strategy countries keep case numbers area traceable. one efficient measures lift quite restrictions without uncontrolled spreading. still cases day amount people get infected really low (Germany 3 deaths average per day now).

And want eradicate longer lockdown would need everywhere time simply impossible idiotic politicians sweden, uk us countries able sustain lockdown. low number cases fine long stay traceable. memory cells start production antibodies moment come across virus body again. pretty much make non-issue? 🤷‍♂️ Really logical answer.

Yes, know think either.... vaccine run full year, that's bad - studies suggesting immunity may last short 90 days. Climate change going hit hard next 20-30 years, I’m predicting. total collapse society, increased severe weather events, drought, crop failures, global pandemics. one going tax country without suffer find way profit. 5 years look back say ""Remember back America country and..."" think previous excess death numbers vicinity 1.2-1.3

I've looking clear update studies (sars-2 official numbers vs excess death per state/country) find them. pointer?

Edit: colleges below: (indicating 1.3 reported deaths disagree interpretation completely.

No, aren’t. think are, misinformed worse uninformed. Renewable energy can’t support baseload power demands come people require energy throughout day. don’t storage capacity use excess energy times provide insufficient energy. Nuclear, geothermal hydro clean power sources provide baseload power supply. Geothermal hydro highly limited regionally, leaving nuclear environmentally conscious, viable option. called “environmentalists” ones holding back. don’t know first thing issue, think sounds scary. reality built safe power plants. It’s approximately safe renewables far safer fossil fuel clearly know do. Hopefully fix problem sooner rather later. Poverty Catholicism.

I'm even religious person recognize that. Lived year. Really great place. Wow. Another reason love Germany. Like ever needed another reason. Still doesn’t make sense even conspiracy perspective. 

As long hospital reports increasing hospitalizations, maybe get “bonus” money. wide range COVID symptoms could report practically anyone “maybe COVID, treating give us money”. There’s obvious incentive.

Where’s incentive falsify death records?

It's like recommending great restaurant. still 100% optional. Must finally realized he’s killing people likely vote love analogy especially captain private cabin, true lol Admittedly, said deaths, mind even wrote post. money dealt diagnoses, often squeezed death report pad numbers. Could use reassurance someone! mom mentioned went walk it’s sort fault socially distancing people sidewalk, said idiot walked burped really loudly mouth wide open walking next her, coming opposite direction.

There droplets emitted, guess there’s much worry about, anyone confirm this? Neither person wearing mask unfortunately. Though mom pre-diabetic know they’re risk thought would ask. She’s experienced symptoms (this happened two days ago). It’s crazy. competent leader makes wise decisions country things turn well. 

Sure, advantages countries due location density, put trump supporters there, would disaster too. it’s total chicken egg dilemma: comes first? tears semen? I'll sneak Canada get free one. Canada stop me, build wall? sure hope so, I’m student can’t believe reopening schools even debate, yet hand, see authorities can’t wait kill us, cause god forbid fall behind yacht payments pushing get through. That's kind testing capacity actually need. like 15k kids die daily life is, sometimes lethal.

It's like 10k deaths per year ages 1-14. fair, person's math wildly well. stats gave, going 900 covid deaths school kids contracted it.  finally covered putrid hole face. Like would ever click link fat fuck. Well live Nevada shutting ain't happening, kill off. know death part life, right? assuming everyone 1 kid intentionally poor, makes bad decisions life, chooses die car accident? I’m confused logic. 

Or saying people make “good” choices life actually die accidents? exactly tell mother father, longer living, stopped kids? 

That doesn’t make much sense. guess empathy doesn’t make much sense certain people. Guinness Book World Records guy sitting store scratching numbers writing higher ones sharpie fun, Beijingers! dumbing self? we'll stuck 60K cases day kids usually wear masks Halloween anyways? purposefully avoided trump things months... correct wrong say China virus press conference?  can't forgive, forget cannot stop laughting hahahahahaha spot on, education key overcoming poverty. However, agree people living poverty access education birth control. talking specifically USA poorer countries Asia Africa access education birth control non-existent. People need objectively look issues facing admit self inflicted. Hip hop culture; glorifying drugs, gang culture, violence condescending females part that. terrible role models fake gangster hip hop celebrities. Look children teens watching YouTube days. media guilty much money anybody power care. Healthcare worker lives matter. 

While karens idiots toting around covid fake news masks violate rights. Healthcare workers picking result idiots say dumb shit. frustrating. Bless healthcare workers, went strike whose going help end results karens? That's exactly thinking. go work, likely service-type industry option remote work. may wanted isolate, life margin left personal preference. work get evicted starve. saying grown-ups general, men?

It makes wonder actual percentage mask wearing across any/all dimensions demographics... as; gender, nationality, career, education, age, IQ, political them(?), even others around doing, etc. 

It would interesting enlightening, maybe little shocking.

However, literally mean men, that's pathetic anyone giving perception. Personally really care much people think, want see people needlessly suffer I'm ignorant negligent. one knows long-term effects virus is, foolish tempt point. 

I'm lucky family totally fine mask wearing respects social distancing. miss former reality, they're tough guess. 

Don't get wrong, though, people cannot convince wearing one. Even big joke maintain consistency standards making mask effective. So... big problem US.

People need snap it. Well I’m going restaurants group Man could started much earlier. Trump brand masks, blame China. Rally base China buy mask beat virus make America great spite China. Show tough virus, bashing China causing everything. would easy seem tough top of. would made much better. Like god wait long. accepted end May hard headed weren’t going believe it’s real affects directly someone know hospitalized dying.

It sucks, want people know take seriously, don’t want suffer loved one affected do. confused ""you're welcome"" change much. people stupid Trump came scene, stupid Trump gone same. Still better nothing though. give another couple weeks. damage already done opinion. Trump fucked whole thing bad think he's done already. Al gore wanted save planet We've indoctrinated ignoring health concerns forty years now. Big tobacco transitioned pretty neatly equally deadly packaged/fast food industry. There's lot money made getting people essentially pay kill themselves. No.....
Go on..... Like knowing difference University Hong Kong CDC?

Regardless, CDC came conclusion based review the JAMA editorial, Redfield colleagues cited three recent studies suggest universal mask policies reduce spread. The first study, published in JAMA, described association universal mask requirements reduction COVID-19 infections among healthcare workers Mass General Brigham, largest healthcare system study published the Morbidity Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), authors described no infections among 139 clients hair salon Missouri or contacts exposure two symptomatic, masked stylists tested positive COVID-19. salon required face coverings stylists CDC science supports it. 

Wear mask. yet, brother says people wearing masks Ventura County. Cause MAGA kool-aid people ruin everything  Also got put blame ideologies ban limit access contraceptives. Wait, talking NYC LA?  schools. One students danger others restrained principals. put clear spit mask kept spitting trying bite them. Cara Cara oranges GOAT orange cases, deaths. Deaths lag 5 weeks  Baby wear masks, more. Trump quite Un-impressive? Yeah, checks out. Ya fuckin missed Robert! say kids? don’t think one person 11 kids, sounds like roommates with, what, four five adults, couple kids (or younger siblings) each... did. 
 
No, actually brought political parties. mean, gonna troll, maybe call person responding actual thoughts troll, maybe don’t accuse something literally anyone read paragraph see isn’t true? dunno, I’m spitballing here. facts baby facts runaway growth case numbers 10 states. long delay graph cases deaths -- 1-2 months. even though death number started climbing, case numbers increased far recently. Given time deaths would catch quite bit. something pat back for. called wave anymore. simply first purge.  SH*T. medical degree, I’m statistician, barely passed Pre-Algebra...and knew would happen. WTF Aww u mad 'so far' Actual Title: _COVID-19 Sex_ Ah thanks reminding that!!! completely forgot Texas GOP actually that. Yeah education country (and particular states) been...well lack better way phrase dangerously stupid past decades gotten worse. Wrong United States. America made 35 countries. Canadians, Mexicans, Cubans they’re American too. 🙃 Lol absolutely polling numbers think finally sewing seeds panic doubt within him. keeps he's track monumental electoral blowout. He's every single one traditional swing states last 3-4 elections much several long really can't even considered swing state point. ""swing states becoming previously +15% rred states. Texas legitimately play now. Yes, many rushing sake humanity. Many stated intentions make profit vaccine. expect right cutting corners, winning race important, someone produces safe vaccine. greed motivator expect corners cut. link then? confirmed cases US go by, kind hard ignore. remember watching clip makes somebody unlikable, assume every one ulterior motive.

Might suggest add politicizing pandemic speculation. help already know stubborn people already. rich people kids? nice eugenics there. I'm sorry happened you, unfortunately really discovered ""magic"" thing say people survived situations come side thinking ""well got it, what's problem everyone else?""

Deep think know answer. hard confront. answer chance. got lucky. really offends you, fine, makes feel better, let's say due innate superiority. 

Either way, matter? someone innately inferior you, blame making ""right"" decisions would?

Some people (if ever even get told contraception, STDs, importance education, stay away gangs drugs, etc) right people right times. Misery happens. Despair happens. Loneliness happens. Mistakes happen.

Shit...for know terrible irresponsible person stereotyped head might fetal alcohol syndrome, born addicted crack, gnawed lead-painted windowsill, raped trafficked...

Whatever situation experienced, think might like even worse. try imagine millions people living life. millions living even worse one that. Correct. happened 2017. Here's read Chinese. depends happened national standards... son lucky get full custody grandson divorce bi-polar wife ignored court hearings poofed wind went grid. grandkid 13 now, happy getting great grades school (well home distance learning anyway). Leaving best thing mom could've done him. 21 days catching dying. weeks see. Hanging other. Sending kids camp. Shopping crowded stores. 

I’m Bay Area friends thought careful — they’re quite simply stupid they’re tired kids. Good news, anti-vaxxers lowered number significantly. Aye, certain level stupid wear mask pandemic. Sure, Narcissistic personalities may susceptible idea need concern health others “expense” (which course relative) truly idiotic people refuse consider beyond empathetic reasons wearing mask. critically thinking narcissist likely wear mask willfully ignorant neurotypical. It’s barbaric even allow profit based healthcare system.. sad considered dangerous usually immediately attacked perspective 😢🥺 Source?  think anyone is. get staying home listed low instead none. I'm single family home one going out, risk there. Similarly playing tennis presents low risk rather low/medium imo. agree totally understand coming from. first hotspot going major city. could LA, NYC, etc, going one those.

But started conversative America issue. orange dot, pizza sauce stain American flag themed napkin wonder capitalist society could play part creating people like this. Greed seems fall line type personality. “Politics enraging subject” - stayed r/politics sub week gave up, made anxious felt terrible reading arguments. Non-political subs now... People Asia years. hope majority people continue wear masks future. solution via qi gong meditation. 

Only... realize deep rabbit hole went. 

I've told childhood able develop autonomy, affected way energy developed. 

In coming study meridian pathways, I've realized entire front channel branch front related communicate exchange world, I've basically great deal trouble doing. 

Once told found voice yet. found it... that, able talk place fear think going say could speak. After, able speak stream consciousness communicate well. took lot work time courage. 

Next, learned solar plexus agni fire digestion. discovered trouble activating digestive fires, via careful work able explore feel like regulate power center via burning impurities energy. 

But pretty difficult me, I'm still learning. Along way I've also discovered principle connected lineage, 7 generations forwards backwards, work influences lineage, even death. 

Which started making lot sense, whenever would qigong, pwBPD would freak out, like hurting them. 

Next discovered Barbara Brennan's books went energetic cording generations, also stating seen remain death. 

So began realizing work healing, directly comes conflict pwBPD's efforts control reality, really like fighting, dunno I'm doing, waiting let go, heal without fighting? 

It adds recall fruitful work I've done qigong period serious relationship, first period life energetic attachment loosened due focus another. great. experienced amazing transformations energy. 

And started trouble work. energy seemed get stiffer stiffer, happened inevitable falling person unconditionally enabling her, longer willing so, attentions fell back onto me. Like, I'm Low Contact, live 700 miles away, still palpable thing try energy work. life incredibly intense. Activism, multiple ongoing legal battles, family feuds, commandeering control organizations ousted, fighting landlords neighbors. Intense. 

At one point life invited work class intense style shaman, impeccability retracing shadows past. clearly directed cut ties her, extreme path me, end prefer navigate harmony balance, extremes. suppose see clearly clear point is. denial lineage, denial currently manifested compromised ego momentum within lineage. able cut connection work, achieve cleansed trauma lineage able communicate respect higher souls parents way able compromised living selves. 

However, also denial lower soul work necessary work community toward healing collective shadow souls within society. 

Alas, I've told I've already bhodisattva, path ascend. yet told someone also blocked seeing shadow others. believe wonderful us reach higher path turns, also believe us make progress need acknowledge work culture shadow well. Otherwise focus healing separate suffering, trauma continues sink. 

And am, message us profound many even able listen without complete rejection. layer depth message penetrates trauma within society conditioned intense rejections for. 

So really know - bigger me. Maybe cut ties ascend. reason us flesh blood humans actually cultivate spiritually greater degree many far us terms cultivation spiritually higher planes - embodiment within physical reality gives us leverage operate change - leverage access to. thus leaving behind heavens answer me. me, answer work help heavens become reintegrated within physicality, may connected, rather continuing drift apart. 

Deep secrets here, wounded healer. Blessing y'all. much that's - bite chew. reminder.

There proof polls making take stance. That's assumption left leaning guy Reddit. post sarcasm / joke well mate ;) virus slowly destroying live... doesn’t kill depression sure believe me. Nobody deserves this, tired crying strangers dying strangers much fucking narcissistic asshole wear mask stay home. already know causes lung scarring, yes can. Sorry bro lost article. I'm then...you can't say certainty often cause lung scarring. guys still getting Godzilla Dust Storm? took literally 4 months say this?! prez horrible mean, worth, thing could said NY (and rest world) towards Wuhan.

Transmission rate never one CA. Let's blame billionaires pieces shit weed  don’t know, man. I’ve seen crazy shit people went amiibos back 2014 first one? Tell boss bud. heard waves symptoms customers friends, least heat without fever, coughing thick mucus.
Just talked one, said waves less intense time, almost unnoticeable. usual work sport routine, quite strict hard exercise reduced workload months.
Did kind test confirm? Another painfully obvious statement. Really???? shocking disagree sentiment, cancer killing 550,000 heart disease killing 650,000, really ""unfathomable?""

And treat cancer heart disease gravity deserves. I'd argue majority people story losing least one family member, friend, acquaintance heart disease cancer. yes, idea almost half million people could die novel disease year US alone Even absolutely nothing COVID, we'd see lots deaths year trickle pretty much continuously much lower numbers, probably seasonally.

We idea long immunity Looking 10 years so, cancer/heart disease killing 10+ million is, imo, truly unfathomable thing going here.

This feels like whataboutism. Oh wow totally see coming. Nope all.. idea science somehow requires 'belief' insane. interested subject? Sure. like gravity stops somehow believe physics.  

Granted, knowledge average US citizen's world view filled entirely headlines Reddit. That's probably overblowing crazies, country plenty too. dirty spreader. family must devastated. That's fewer new confirmed cases deaths last Wednesday's report. begining March.. one really knew. widespread already was. Chinese scientific papers mediocre quality. figures skewed etc. etc.. one really knew against. protocols triage manuals focussing life threatening signs otherwise healthcare system would collapse.

we know lot today, approach still half baked. healthcare system still prepared (lack trained staff biggest bottleneck)

It really takes long time medical society accept risks threatments order find right medicine. understandably potential deadly disease. Luckily several studies found ways improve survival rates 30% 40% suffer ARDS part.
but milder cases however really guidance.
no treatment options.
we left own. 
That problem worldwide.
As effects working population huge shows chronic like e.g. Herpes Virus.
At point one really knows long term effects. Bats pretty disgusting huge disease carriers. basically flying rats think able get [emeril work security lowes...but maybe could training video.

btw- liquid propane it..? roast them? Nope, Germany menthol cigarettes banned May 20th year Merkel + spahn + söder (all three Great job) blame think right go without mask. People literally shot stabbed this. worked Lowe's $9.40 hour enough confront belligerent Q follower possibly attacked. employees already putting risk continuing work. 

It's no-win situation. 

Could hire somebody stand outside check masks? Certainly, many area brag taking mask minute get past door. point becomes security theater. certainly envy anybody working public right now. Well say country, man. Lots places control people sub talking Americans. That's frustrating. would one thing never allowed work home (I'd still disagree it, least there's sort precedent point) allowing work home even though allowed stupid. True. This. Everyone keeps saying kids need go back social aspect school. 

What return basically eLearning, teacher babysitting. Desks spaced much possible facing way. partner group work. Minimal class discussions projection voice releases particles air. Minimal paper assignments reduce paper passing sharing materials. Using online versions textbooks. primarily chromebooks work. Masks times. 

Lunches spaced far possible assigned seating. One way halls students discouraged gathering socializing. Limits bathroom capacities. constantly hammered wash hands sanitize. 

We haven’t heard plan PE, theater, art, career/technical education, band, orchestra, etc. classes literally make school experience lot kids. 

High schoolers literally feel like school prison. Younger children almost certainly traumatized. none even addressing mental toll take anxious exposure grief losing friends/family/staff members. Well look court houses shut across nation. Prior Covid courts set clogged. Let's put perspective.

When Bush tried sue home owners eminent domain 2001 put huge wall (which Texans told popular president Texas no).

Yeah. Those? 9+years later still settled yet. that's massive amount lawyers unlimited budget. Death rate where?  I'll bite probably bad faith argument. ""both sides"" mask mandates taking account? 

And no, mandating masks people wearing voluntarily harassing assaulting employees attempting enforce company rules citizens wearing masks bad reason mandate them. That's excellent reason. True enough. China said inside last 3hrs air. counts imo Oh heard gates one given women Africa become sterile. Sigh Oh, gosh! certainly did! Dengue would exception, rule. like takes leader normalize IMO isn’t evidence virus spread anybody eating bat. virus spread contact. SARS, example, started bat spread virus somebody’s pet.

Glad see r/Coronavirus educated viruses spread.

I’ll comply anything that’s constitutional. you’re going usher state suspension better damn good reason (a much higher risk/death rate covid).

Preserving constitution/liberties could easily argued “best everyone” long term.

Why move communistic country? There’s many choose from... They'll enforce states willing shut repeated violations. get legal department production line, make masks, undercut prices gougers?

In shortage like this, think bad thing prices go up. creates incentive hospitals disinfection reuse make N95s available non-healthcare workers. Lots jobs healthcare involve significant exposure, lot workers using cloth masks, better nothing adequate risk level. Apology, typo, meant say “different”. Note: guy appears full-time anti-mask/""virus nothing"" person.

You conclude remaining sentiment above. crazy. saw many people place, including Fauci, saying we're opening fast. November elections it’ll gone like came /s Ha. Entitled much forgot opposite argument:

Antivaxxers IFR everywhere. That’s definition bubble. biggest economic bubble lifetimes. Evidence good sir, evidence. 

I give evidence need trudeaus scandals. back assumptions? 

I would rather neither you. really projecting? Literally every single country planet massive scale PCR tests.

You impressively misinformed nothing special making tests unreliable

The CDC's primers hairpin. made shitty primers. That's it. It’s bad science purposes people declaratively say immunity short lasting imo especially reports T-cells providing longer immunity coming It’s starting. really see issue comparing US's handling Kuwait, Iraq, Kazakhstan, etc? Like issue all? That's completely logical you?

You think might meant every US state better 99% planet without forgetting level development political stability? Seeing experts confidence reach herd immunity vaccine seems like good news me. New cases directly tied number tests, still 15-16% positive 55k tests. say single word deaths hospitalizations. said new cases stabilizing, are. situation sucks take whatever victories get, matter small.  “a lot people” heresay based real data anecdotal cases heavily reported media. need panic! Evidence shows antibodies keep getting infected entirely, issue drop 3 months may disappear completely 6-12 months. means need booster shots time being, develop much effective ""killshot"" vaccine. 

And assuming also lose B-cell memory, current science believes last[ know miracle talking about?? needed minutes make chart. also see visually looking covid hospitalizations chart next covid deaths chart. Especially downtrend period may/june see deaths dropped 1/4 peak hospitalizations dropped 1/2 peak look spikes Portland protest areas. Protests going while. see spikes bars are. don’t need imagine.

But retail store outdoor mall? Customers allowed inside. husband’s retail store? Also allows customers inside. Nothing changed, it’s pure stupidity. New cases stabilizing, i.e. they're flattening number. Hospitalizations deaths start falling new cases fall even lag that. ideal trend better trend. Congrats.

A lot landlords spike prices knowing people forced live near work school. 

So dont housing, dont proper control. Brazil position 107 tests per capita position 14 cases per capita, position 12 deaths per capita position 2 total number cases total number deaths.

There's much need know. Texas' test-positivity also appeared stabilize around 15-16% That's still way high course... least getting even worse.

I'm curious see test-positivity rate trends county, especially Hidalgo county (Rio Grande valley) Harris county (Houston). anyone numbers available?

Like I’ll chew chew chew five minutes spit body won’t let swallow. Eating become torture chore. okay great, liquids soft food much much easier eat. Well, fun hurdle get nutrients 70% time it’ll come right back again. carry vomit bag literally everywhere. It’s especially fun need vomit nothing actually throw you, start dry heaving sink crying. 

My biggest trigger vomiting actually water. cannot drink water comes right back out. I’m dehydrated probably too. least I’m getting sense taste smell back maybe it’ll start get appetizing. Kept toast first solid food I’ve weeks. here’s hoping. definitely CA. Gov Newsom shut indoor dining restaurants scrambling outdoor dining places streets parking lots everywhere mad cities don’t give space. guess University Toronto based Canadian read this, glad help. I’m happy dr willing work find right dosages right medications get tough times. Second opinions likely would hurt afford them. im almost 2 weeks, Thursday No, Frenchman, refuse get war 1870!

It entirely Germany's fault. must be. mean, thing nation Germany time? mean, sides wanted war?

/s surprised coronavirus kill him, dismembered eaten emu got little taste last time. Yeah bad CCP blocked researchers entering China study virus early on... steal research try take credit leads developing vaccine. true pro athletes tend different type heavy tbf ""Other experts even reassuring. little definitively known coronavirus, seven months pandemic, new virus behaving like others, said, lending credence belief herd immunity achieved vaccine."" can’t believe title leaves best recommendation pandemic sex: gloryholes   /r/ZombiesAteMyFace  Yep, might high 100x flu 0.01% covid 1% (both pretty common estimates IFR two diseases). main page? article bullshit. It’s easy he’s idiot. Magic underwear. It’s suggested practice, mandate. Use 🖐 🤚. ..that's actually point matters.  Great— get wealth redistribution 😜 I’m currently accepting donations. would really rough go without AC.

I took trip flying Zurich. Walked terminal (hot spring day,) really warm inside. staff formally dressed wearing suits ties. asked one guy dealing heat.
He told Americans spoiled AC, it, miss it. Yep wrong👆🏻
I’m CMA family practice messages see lately CEO COO well “annual wellness exams” doing, need increase getting schedules full. It’s really sad. (Just got tested today coV due exposure work failed screening system patients staff). We're starting research MIS-C, necessarily appear months initial infections. Often child never showed symptoms COVID19 infection, test positive antibodies go doctor MIS-C. fatal, enough time really gauge prevalent is.

It rare right now, sure, also barely grasp many adults even infected, much less many kids were. higher infection rates needed achieve herd immunity given constant level infectiousness susceptibility. article suggests large portion population susceptible begin would imply infection could never exceed certain level. tell obese picture gofundme 

Redditors underestimating impact obesity risk factor. may orange dot, said still stands. also bring back Galavant show it? loved cheeky tunes.  saying something different? I'm disagreeing majority Americans want it. I'm saying (and hasn't) mattered want. Sunday fox interview did. Unless COVID combated directly trumps businesses... trust me, 10% going somewhere.  American. Nobody know either. Trump worries Covid also. He’s worried locks country he’ll personally lose huge amounts money stocks holdings. It’s Miss Theme-Park rest week carries like today going good week evidence supports this? us military real 1 percent. Total job security. Freedom movement. Must nice. think there's good guideline set school, okay. fact, look countries school opened back never shut down. set strict guidelines follow. means social distancing, rigorous hand washing routines, wearing masks PROPERLY. That's lot places keeping counts low. think may good kids learn lot things school, like practicing proper hygiene, socially responsible, such. moment, think Florida's cases high allow anyone sit virus comfort. adults school too, let's forget. also cases like 14-year-old kid hung friends, came home, infected entire family coronavirus father hospitalized

The disconnect came constant politicizing virus, parents feeling entitlement alone beat virus. overall lack civil responsibilities. You’re misinformed it’s even funny. 7% websites world aren’t hosted us. think every mobile device OS website disappeared overnight tech would stall call crazy. Enjoy ignorance boner though. actually interesting idea. seen virtual education work. wonder future teachers taught better ways adapt it, much better could work. course did. Anyone call two World Wars 'beautiful' say anything. mom type believe random garbage internet, debunking going work one, every insane thing looking at. Get facebook social media literally never achieved herd immunity virus without vaccine.

Source? Perhaps understand well enough, thousands years vaccines constantly battle every disease ever forever? could change depending concert say, orchestra was, example Slayer. guess that's one way stroke economy back life. gonna handle restrooms concessions though? sub starting feel like short bus? hate this, become taboo take virus seriously? Idk talking about, school still happening Bro live regular apartment, nothing special. Eh, says numbers accurate connections flawed. obvious FL counting based purely number cases vs states. 

Do really find likely 6x cases CT started deaths last week? state retirement state, full vulnerable people this. death count low? can't fix stupid %10... That's pocket change military... Here... penny?!? brought dose side effects minimal.

What? side effects 100%. ""everybody gets side effects"" equate ""minimal"". first time since early June 1,000 deaths... gunz = goodbye Covid  think meant would throw away without ever opened it. probably would too, I’m honest, luckily received direct deposit.  heads up, think name screencap Facebook. utter bullshit. wonder much Americans would voluntarily put towards military year real choice. Sure hell $2,000 per person. would life-changing money lot people. wait next season Ozark comes please? also employee shot telling someone wear mask. safer employees mandatory state store. Easier get police involved things go south. simply full meaningless statements. There's nothing debunk. Yeah evidence T-Cells remember virus induce immune response. T-Cells SARS 1 still present 17 years. announced they’re going back half in-person, half-online. give month forced go fully online Oregon specifically, 1 380 COVID-19 already given enough freedom Agreed, gotten worse late. many push narrative death counts inflated, idiots believe them. calling china virus try shift blame china pathetically bad response actions last 6+ months regarding this. humble post, like People voted them. guess fully understand asking. ""American health care #1, anyone else says got testing done quicker another country lying commi hares freedom wants invade America"" - average conservative/republican That’s antibody testing too, it’s easy get cell testing could show even antibodies show Oxfords vaccine works vaccinating vulnerable people front line workers Halloween realistic task? don’t even trick treat anything I’m trying see timeline holds bad lot cool stuff closed Source? earth would secretly wear masks want anyone know? Imagine happen makes kids sterile... like already evidence for. Sure, poli sci 101 ""aCtUAlly"" pedantic terms. 

But colloquially, democracy == republic. Practically speaking, U.S. neither, [its power] must derived great body society, inconsiderable proportion, favored class it; otherwise handful tyrannical nobles, exercising oppressions delegation powers, might aspire rank republicans, claim government honorable title republic

These decent job describing it, doesn’t. want dipshit out.  He's also failing take account deaths spike hospitals overcrowded. Hospitals capacity right now. Give couple days capacity. death rates going soar.  lockdowns bad idea. likely make everything worse. Lockdowns aren’t good mental health adults children. Lockdowns lead child abuse, alcoholism domestic violence. what? virus .5% IFR IFR well .1% people 50. 

And didn’t even go economic impact lockdowns. amount suicides. 

What’s goal lockdown lovers? Lockdown vaccine? That’s extreme position deserves mocked it’s advocates deserve told menaces are. Imagine traumatized kids be, people school keep getting sick, even dying. It’s worth it. make sure number 1 large margin first. Unfortunately, think headline going applicable frequently future. actually funding fighting coronavirus: 
""56 percent likely voters support cutting military budget 10 percent *to pay priorities like fighting coronavirus, education, healthcare, housing*."" I'm seeing downside. Take away free air time. people watch Fox/OAN already adore him. becomes bigger shit show get clips share. Please no.. first thing go paycheck 18 days 4th July... nope total mystery, can’t solved science though? early campaign season. Joe start crazy shit soon, media's going ignore start paying attention Kanye. looking different set numbers rest us? article actually mention collective strongly blindly attached group 

So would appear there's actually psychological reason behind this. would love know coming insane 20% herd immunity numbers literally never achieved herd immunity virus without vaccine. House approve vast majority democrats almost republicans voted it. 

&amp;#x200B;

They can't cut hand feeds them! Next year's Olympics certainly still air, think soon say can't happen. Leaving aside presence absence vaccine, COVID-19 could mutate less dangerous forms next summer, could strict testing athletes limitations fans like sports successfully doing. 

Or could ban U.S., really blame doing. super rich people they’re talking pro immigration Haha locals. mean future ""servants"" Except Sweden's situation due late slow reaction, decisions made themselves. There's multiple articles cropping it, example mind critique Sweden, prefer keep actual problems. looking solving long-term problems, like health care general, education, social security

\+ climate crisis Plague rats end us.

Hopefully rub noses shit track back things get worse. We’ve lost American covid last 40 years war combined, entire Vietnam war (both, think?) vote new legislature executive. Well yeah....the south..... Oh can. Probably hour though. case dance. !remind 7 days Always been, always be. Tonight could trip floor, hit head brain bleed. obvious reasons don’t consider risks relation going war, things carry much risk others. say devil's advocate here. (and can't stress enough) like trump, first real address feel actually something help America fight virus. Yes sure way late, counting millions problems administration either caused bungled. However, would put good money (and mean like $100 good) mask usage go significantly this. even mentioned vaccines favorable light. anti mask/vaccines people finally get board. point take get. There's much mixing past present tense can't tell actually died. says hopes sharing story get wife treatment needs get healthy get back loves: mother newborn baby, 1-year-old son seven-year-old daughter.  America spends much military 10% cut modest. money help many people. think would justified, Infact funny someone US finds vaccine first gives world wide cost, competition vaccine makers profit US, ends 100x costly get cheap vaccine world Americans. 

And yet, millions upon millions Americans think that's better giving away cost capitalism/freedom. Quitting job also means losing family’s healthcare retirement teachers US. Yeah percent positive increasing took test 14 days ago GA.. results yet is... idea, ordered triple layer cloth masks first week work home. go back work ordered surgical masks face shields. took parents start wearing masks, now. one work wear mask. Even office, like go away put mask ffs, see sitting two masks fogged dripping faceshield bothered wear mask two minutes want stand talk for. articles discuss virus first cases, couldn’t come China. 

It’s considered repost even source different content similar. much got build wall around it. Every day new high cumulative figures. Deaths lag weeks emotional, don’t get all? 

Best come people weak, scared, emotionally immature, lashing out.  He’s fucking narcissist OpSec, people! deaths going materialize?

Are enough materializing yet you? 👋😷 thoughts exactly south, saw people reaction us barred parts EU   Even 50M doses shipped US end year would really knock virus ass, yes agree: cautious optimism. Twice cost free. would way necessary. agree would love see 10% cut reinvesting US instead oversea conflicts looked up. That’s pretty awesome. issue doesn’t bring back dead diminish suffering millions died. Everything reactive. good holding people like Bezos robber barons accountable 40 years they’ve already done damage environment class equality? Scumbags. least hope make affordable. Pretty much everyone planet need vaccine budget tiny profit still make lot money. PR team made him.  iconic. Man, miss days America would fight somrthing thought enemy backing it.

At least would beat shit COVID since think China behind it. chickened yell like 5 year old kid got punched face. certainly can't properly date wearing mask keeping distance. I'm saying worth sacrifice now. I'm saying masks social distancing ""for rest time"" solution. someone know. 

My parents uncles aunt's etc super conservative. Uncle got yesterday. 

Today believing people tested believing Dem thing blown hurt Trump dad went rant people wearing masks serious was. 

That's going take. people literally know someone affected virus. real Japanese, reason.

I guess part [larger Japanese businesses organizations prominent US (although know US perfect either). think ridicule get mean-spirited towards Japanese, [some Japanese complained it, too. God, let woman's son beat shit dude. People, mostly narcissistic, stupid, selfish, uncaring platforms long pandemic. zero social media presence absolute blessing. Yep - likely 1k+ day death rate till 21 days plus every day 7 day rolling average positives 55k-60k. Course Not. I’m surprised. President United States America vindictive shit. Lol 2 completely different articles. article present new info found article  Microscopes enter chat room. get USPS? small vanilla smoothie “cases don’t matter, deaths do” folks now?  You’re literally changing subject provide evidence refute I’ve said. also important note difference states counted Covid deaths. NY counted presumed CV cases deaths, Florida not. 

From January June year Florida 8900 excess deaths. addition, Mar May nationally 122,000 excess deaths.

It's going take years, ever way states obfuscated data, accurate deaths totals, mortality, long term damage, etc. determined. bad never read way cringe hard actually hurts? Wearing mask easy. Considering military one wasteful uses money country has, I'm surprised.

Remember handing bags $100k people Middle East?

Remember like 9 billion dollars accounted for?

And IRS focused whether I, one many overeducated underemployed US citizens, appropriately valued bags *donated* Goodwill?

Let's honest. govt wastes much money (say, golf outings) would enough pay income everyone reading earn whole lives. Guy u said indoors u talking outdoors fyi  Can't wait say deadly lies Trump tells - getting rid Fauci keeping dark scary thing day late dollar short. unleaderlike. 9/11 every 3 days yet federal government much south care less. Unbelievable (I may live bubble, but...) no, news it’s extreme. UV concept. aye.  Wow, hate country. keep seeing newer guesstimates lower 70%. I've seen low 20%, seems low. many around 50% hey also 3rd party enraged everything fact took Trump long start recommending masks social distancing testament shitty president is. don't. That's assault. Prosecute ahole  think huge difference hard ass willingness work together global pandemic. Businesses taking hits everywhere figuring ways make work- could same. Anecdotal evidence among worst evidence rely on. math spreads point H1N1 U.S. (61m cases/13k deaths), we’re looking 2.21 million deaths. That’s assuming drop treatment hospitals fill. throw shit right Trump’s face. Trump put mask hide busted face. Lol work free? give poor people money freedom reproduce. stuck bunch descendants poor people shitty jobs automated time grow  derive diagnostic turn around time data Utah provides. provide measure. thinks masks bad really gonna like climate change. bound happen strategy ""flatten curve"", right? curve fllattened start opening know hospitals handle cases.

The way *wouldnt* lockeddown long hard enough eliminate virus. wouldnt see extra cases opened up. reddit. advice always break up, cut family, hit gym, lawyer up, etc. etc. one actually married.  shop CO normally open 9a.m. 11:45pm. Covid hospitalized US hit 59,316 today. peak 59,538 April 15, increases hospitalized last month looks like unfortunately new Covid hospitalized high reached tomorrow No. people generally responsible cases low test trace. 

Yes, may school related spread, probably able ""skyrocket ""

I'm interested see precautions implement. completely take back urban high schools operating normal.

Edit add: yeah, looked briefly last proposal half kids Rome taught remotely, staggered schedules, Saturday classes facemasks everyone 6 years. Oxford vaccine works enough supplies US also get it, import competitor vaccines US. Resources:

Ok, speak long-term effects. sick corona confused disoriented, sounds like something happens times fever. stand hear something long term, country world persuaded wear fucking mask? schools, kids wear masks day, teachers wear masks day, dangerous? scientist, doctor teacher wondering.
Masks protect people, everyone mask on, safe, no? 
CDC said virus gets back control fades away roughly 6wks everyone wears mask, disconnect? Republicans look random anecdotal evidence backs pre-conceived viewpoints extrapolate reported info. People active brains look actual big picture evidence like excess death rates large unexplained increases pneumonia deaths marked covid. That's wild. dad also interesting dinosaur take. believes existed alongside humans Noan's ark. haircuts. mother law missing entire babyhood grandson. world war, obviously, that's real sacrifice think belittled. something she'll never get back never again. people die causes time never seeing loved ones again. reason break guidelines, obviously, really like attitude one *really* missing anything. it’s politics all? virus floating around since December, CDC started lying masks. Exactly. quick Google search shows think could available September. know people want keep ‘holier thou’ attitude anyone positive depends federal government supporting people staying home work not.

If dont, going continue get worse pandemic front, especially economic front.

It would better PUA kicker plus stimulus checks month get us test trace handle things, instead trying force poor working class back work threat homelessness starvation. Here's bunch headlines generated exact may never coronavirus vaccine, says UK coronavirus vaccine unlikely made widely available 2021, UK vaccine head says

also vaccine Christmas ""a possibility"": UK Vaccine Taskforce Chair

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck people attack ads write themselves. show clips Trump past seven months ""Only 15 cases soon zero,"" ""We've contained pretty close air-tight,"" ""One day go away like miracle,"" ""Inject Lysol fluorescent lights,"" Trump saying ""I think I'll wear mask,"" Trump saying ""Wear mask."" 

All pictures Covid-19 numbers US skyrocketing rest world laughs, pictures refrigerated trucks used emergency morgues, giving one $1,200 check poor Americans giving Trump's buddies millions PPP. Add Trump prioritizing saving Confederate monuments holding political rallies lives American citizens assaulted police American military bounties put heads Trump's buddy Putin. virus contagious covid, “containment” almost impossible. Lol don’t let reading get way good knee jerk opinion Definitely keeping typo ""effective"" highest dose. brought dose side effects minimal. That's point testing. found pumping large amount good idea. inject large amount anything negative results. Alright, goes?

Still disaster, toilet toilets. Fuckin' FINALLY bet stole it! Agreed, seems often case. determine vaccines showing promising trial results fake, criteria commit advance demonstrate vaccine real? wondering 1lb butter enough... schooling widens inequality.

Ah, Nirvana fallacy... let's toss best option (distance/online schooling) ""perfect""... We've assuming we're infected. pain ass makes us little careful. also dedicated sneezing spot lol bathtub. Easier clean sneezing living room something haha Hmm im sure, Trump admitted fault regarding masks yesterday amount people die going bite ass late-stage campaign.

He wont able shift blame anyone else damage done insane point.

Also, people didnt vote last election likely go time. Even idiotic hedonists dont follow politics whatsoever forced notice whats going currently. Yeah I’ve heard that. accent may messing too, grew across 8 different states 4 countries. :P did. Edited accordingly. like scene dramas soap operas see sad woman reacting positive pregnancy test, throws away trash filled bunch tests came back positive. (Eg Devil Flesh) Unequal* agree. Daily death rate definitely far peak.

I originally thought meant deaths compared expected rate since June, think early judge that. Yep. ""seeing"" sick people see before. heartless. care communities whole. care people want wear masks well. stores enforcing masks, providing alternatives want wear one. Delivery, curbside, call ahead. utilizing these. Hell, I'd grab things going someone asked. Hold domestic beer, seen anything yet! Anyone brain new vast majority cases aren’t counted due lack testing large amount asymptomatic cases. also note people mostly worried finances, guess Sweden among others paying Italy's recovery ""summer money"", need worry much it. /s must 10 yank can't read  heart aches first time moms. Hopefully holds baby first time it'll distant memory.  Hope family stays safe numbers rise feel sorry people thought government going lead right direction. Haha, guess like bureau? know, booked hotels flights us. seemed make sense, mostly sounded like lot work book hotels across several different states (we'd changed hotels every 2-3 days 3 week period). Britain island look happened there

London also one world's major transport hubs. fact Britain NZ Islands far comparison goes, situations wildly different. pandemic simply revealing countries proactive leadership

Correct. proactivitiy combined authoritarianism, many anti-gov people undermine it. true. recent scientific article peer reviewed demonstrated robust immune systems included cross reactive immune responses. info new take people adjust specifically focusing antibodies demonstration past infection even broader immunity. He’s shown means shit all.

If wants approved lie cheat steal way making happen.

He way leverage think.

Look he’s number reporting, blocking news congress speaking people, etc.

Getting FDA approve drug likely easy task  performance could parking ticket - maybe even appeal nothing - instead get assault charge. fun that, real winner! Yes, wearing N95 similar mask mitigate risk contracting virus. wearing cloth mask, purpose mainly keep spreading virus respiratory droplets. better take pull neck? Sure, got virus skin neck wearing cloth mask probably contracted anyway. anyone post article chat please? cannot wait see hundreds tRump admin. officials shackles chains. quite literally murderers. Right, doesn’t require education baseline level empathy human. people don’t think they’re supposed care people. seems actually wealth power turns people worthless selfish bastards wouldnt matter election therapist ask ignore external circumstances lead particular mindset. toxic marriage, unfulfilling job unhealthy relationship what's putting negative mindset, worked focus therapy however things individual control. ridiculous neoliberal personal responsibility, merely focusing things outside control yield results.

This approach assumes focusing things within one's control positive outcome. course things like relationship problems cause mental health issues mostly dealt individual. would argue stuck unfulfilling job result larger systemic issues often cannot addressed telling individual reassess career, go back school, look another job, etc. larger external problems root causes, therapy provides means address telling ""you need change attitude, bro,"" fucking pointless. extent larger societal issues problem, need addressed large-scale organizing. thing individual take part resolve issues.

The fact said original post betrays uselessness already gonna part politically voting anyways.

Sure. vote Democrat. That's need do. Everything fine. Go back sleep, like 3/4 Democratic base Obama presidency. There's need organize, worry issues neither party address adequately. vote, go home, forget politics next election. Remember good ol' days stopping traffic Washington bridge considered scandal? Yea 7 day rolling average 1/3 April. growing nearly rate April. 

My question still stands, worse right now? wants protections schools lawsuits wants open Hey now, give Catholics bit credit. good following science based medical advice. Less good dealing child molestors though...

Protestants, however, ones trying pray gay corona away. thing sociopaths think they're good, lack concept good evil. certainly, self-concept, feel wrong; anyone hurt actions blame. conflated moral compass, upon imagine firmly Good side. UPS* 

Ur Poo Shipped Yeah, use personal hobbies attack people. classy. Typical US dick-rider Location? That’s wrong. got hair cut Napa May. You’re talking SF think also one cities that’s best. Shut eh American go back infected country eh? Please thank you. W. I'm hoping possible get supporters start wearing masks, they're ones trapping us mess. mean Australia “we”? US know several people got sick tested flu. forgot sars-cov-1 Yeh understand either, surely world page? want vaccine? no, usual turns pissing contest something monetised. ever country gets vaccine first stands make alot money. horrible, people charge give fuck us, vaccine almost certainly free. need data flu shots worthless. damn sure assume got fucking double blind peer-reviewed 10 billion subject study hand. 80% drop hospitalization RATE. Arizona, cases increased 18x hospitalizations increased 3.5x. heck crammed 6 bedrooms 1500 square feet want know. That's lot bedrooms much room anything else. Yep, one things referring given history hardly blame skeptical. think all. People genuinely think political show going buying stupid. people saying ""it's right wear mask"" indifferent people's lives, rather think made get mad people insisting they're jerks buying consider baseless hysteria.

Imagine woke one day conservative media insisted wear propellor beanies keep earth exploding, everywhere went people bugging wearing propellor beanie. Also economy shut focus propellor beanie production lost job told could stuff like anymore indefinite period. think lot Americans right mentally regarding COVID. WPS recent Daily Podcast people view possible vaccine really eye opening.  feel bad CoronaVirus. 3 times contracted Bolsonaro. Must debilitating. I'm curious work ? vaccine exist like pre-purchase ensuring 100 million units available americans finished / tested ? Go rona. Yes. Good government impossible. go far abolish it. much communism anarchism nice theory, practice government neccerasy evil, such, must used last resort, first answer problems.

Most importantly believe people involved government aspiring be. interest interest. Holy crap. want educate you? Like make sure read articles newspapers bring *every year*? 

**You read *those* articles, that's saying**, right?

Like 2017 danish police concerned political agenda revolving around patients went newspapers confessed publicly taking mentally ill people middle nowhere leave there? 

**""It happens police solution drop person field kilometers outside city."" ""Then peace day,"" officer remarks.**

But **you** pay attention articles, right?

Hans Wolff said ""*one might question either capability Denmark better maybe Denmark*"" TV2 

But **as long happening somebody else, fine it**, correct? 

Because **you** culture torture fine it. 

And mind Denmark collaborating CCP. SOB really later symptom. Especially exposed yesterday. However, rule may exposed interaction yesterday. symptoms?

SOB certainly anxiety too. started waste around time conceived. Don’t dick, they’ve already delayed trip. It’ll interesting election. expect lot 3rd party votes year protest shit candidates got year. Truly Nurgle blessed restaurant group, never eat in. Ever. much death disease serving day? ewww! AZ simply testing fewer people. 

Louisiana testing AZ, that’s seems like cases dropping.  can’t believe getting takeout low risk. feel like lot recommendations partly influenced impact society. many people don’t cook MUST pay others them. you’re A) often going restaurant pick up, B) putting food prepped strangers restaurant mouth! little clue food handling prep. mention you’re touching containers food comes in. disease known rest surfaces anywhere 1 3 days depending materials. can’t buy it. work part-time brewery requires mask ordering bar (you remove back room/patio everything spaced social distancing). taproom, keep mask entire shift. guy come mid-order remove masking stating ""needed breathe""

I resisted urge call guy baby deserve beer. owner likely would've backed up, figured he'd taproom sooner served him.

Wear mask stay fuck home Teenage mutant ninja turdles I'm sure President Trump spoken let know virus going go away ~~spring~~ ~~heat~~ ~~july~~ ~~summer~~ Here's article NPR gives bats Malaria 😀 So...no actual response, then?

Have good one. I’m sure sensitivity NSAIDs certain class antibiotics would indicate problems getting vaccine though? fuck aren’t locked again? wonder Trump thinks game changer. Actually think well understood all. Many believe fatality rate 5-10% (based news reports comments political leaders) understand acknowledge difference case infection rates.

When consider IFR around 0.68% 80% fatalities high risk groups (elderly comorbidities), paints different picture average person. would mean high risk group, chance fatality 0.14%. Ouch! Yes 40%. Time ban religion schools wait generation. See things clear up.  tells places opened later also see spikes.  I’ll admit didn’t read bc usually complete moron. that’s good I’m glad he’s making sense read well. New York Minnesota stand cities massive protests, Covid spikes, strong evidence there. 

California spiking state weird me, wonder protests effected there, Covid numbers weren’t low MN NY protests started. Also, NY, kept hearing reading “California right” March stay home order NY. I’m confused Cali rise. closed early didn’t open fast AZ/FL/TX. People always choice. tend take selfish one rather ethical one, evolutionarily speaking correct one. Good thing creationists tipping balance toward ethical choice! /s cant make sense statement, lockdown open bars gyms?

They arent even open theres lockdown. eradicated Smallpox, got pretty close eradicating Polio worldwide. Measles nearly wiped out, made comeback due Anti-vaxxers.

&amp;#x200B;

The Flu comes back every year mutates quickly reassorts RNA every year way brand new virus immune systems, sometimes ready vaccine highly effective it, years much, occasionally new assortment influenza pop unexpectedly vaccine cycles (2019 H1N1 Swine Flu good example), able infect anyone effective vaccine produced. \~410k cases state, \~306k 10 SoCal counties. 48 counties (including Bay Area Sacramento) 100k total cases. SoCal needs get shit together.

(My numbers may days old) mod disable comments say ""no wishing death someone here"" tell right goddamn Food City supermarkets abomination Deep South. Employees wearing masks, better believe *zero* fucking enforcement customers coming without them. Exactly question: Americans?
Ten bucks says Three Corrupt Branches Government get first, people poverty disabled get last, there’s left. 
Disgusting.  I'd say wear mask. wife wipes everything clorox handi-wipes. 

I wish knew else. 

Thanks asking. 


God speed. Along lines, yes, I'm STEM field Benjamins 💸💸💸 Bummer :( Lower quality healthcare? I’m sure agree that. You’d agree patients good judges type care receive no? Well according many studies done past 10 years, especially since Obamacare passed even that, black people pretty satisfied healthcare receive. feel doctors want what’s best them. 

The issue underlying health problems far prevalent black community, relative size, minorities. Which, tandem COVID-19, leads higher mortality. knew Covid still refused listen directions infected people, charged way people knowingly spread STDs charged.  think genuinely kind person gave people latitude one else could impacted. people tried take advantage kindness expanded hostility directed staff. calls noncompliance. lesson learned sure. Lock ass Can't argue 🤷‍♀️ miss Bill Paxton Seems quite bit better Remdesivir point sending parent surveys planning scrap one three options? much flip flop FAKE NEWS!!! HERO WOULD NEVER WEAR MASK!!! /s woman like article essential worker that’s minimum wage never lost job? She’s making unemployment? There’s millions jobs like that. ...is really good question ask mental health professional.   Glad picked Tin man instead. long require hospitalization, self-isolate home, reducing contact others much practicable

But address supposed get hospital, health dept. pre-approved ambulance her. mention deaths less likely happen due lockdown. Car accidents, sports accidents, regular flu deaths, etc. People South Korea looking murder charges. That’s I’ve got say. Hopefully dies, world like 25% better strange capitalisation always stands me. makes tweets look even worse. think person see tweets like besides Chris-chan.  Apparently people self isolate lending test results eligible unemployment unable work due isolation. authority ability manage logistics nationwide scale could move supplies states needed it. Considering many atrocities Pfizer committed past FDAs watch... yes, absolutely. Especially specific extraordinary circumstance. Americans keep power govt funding 3/4 it, sure. think that's true.  system meant keep people down. grew poverty stuff. Despite constantly working ass off, always struggle. managed get education. Struggle. insane really frustrating hell. hard enough get poverty shit works gotten worse. quite unfortunate tragedy way. People fault poor lazy without realizing fucking difficult survive never it. People make mass assumptions assistance including health insurance. 

It seems lost folks basic needs difficult obtain working minimum wage job. Working two. hard find much else even education. Shit even pay teachers worth. also seems missed point, noticed pandemic, people literally risking working say grocery stores, important make more. 

Of course they're back getting shit keeps things moving rich. rest trying get by. Without folks, rich make 100k + year (shit even mind 60 - 75k), they're used to. really blows much. People get treated like shit trying jobs extremely difficult, anyone ever worked service kind knows, can't even get courtesy basic needs covered time.

It would lovely people idolize rich assume money equates hard work intelligence. cases sure. definitely always nearly always wealth created actual work seeing nothing. Bezos great example. good idea, right place, right time, etc... Richest man planet. Could change world give back literally work spending, give day. fuck all. disgusting. 

Sorry rant. Just, wish stereotyping would end would. are. 

Thank you. I'll right.

And yes course get heart attack COVID, serious viral influenza infection trigger acute myocardial infarction, however, outcome patients acute myocardial infarction influenza infection largely unknown.

So stuff, including tamponade, pretty usual, (or ""not uncommon""), see older person ends hospital severe respiratory viral infection, especially intubation involved.

So yes .. happen. least particular study supporting idea ""Even dont die COVID, even mild case, might end mysterious serious after-effect affect life"".

And exactly may people presenting it. back claims show studies like did, *sound* ominous reduce sentence, end much pedestrian actually read study unpack exactly says and, usually importantly, say.

So saying ""long-term serious COVID effects"" dont exist, saying studies people shown think proof that, established. Indeed. know people breathing enclosed, infected air major cause spread, NYC metro area mass transit (subway, LIRR, NJ transit, etc) perfect infecting many people possible. think anywhere else country get close (actual) numbers simply due reliance mass transit. Actually watch video owner supports wearing mask thinks bothers stay 6 feet away anyone see wearing mask.

They closing make want mask rule enforced stop giving crap enforcing it. 

This 180 story people expect. **Werlabs tested 80,000 Stockholm: 14.5 percent antibodies**

The company Werlab's antibody tests show 14.5 percent tested Stockholm last three weeks antibodies covid-19.

&amp;#x200B;

During three-week period, Werlab took samples 83,000 people. these, 80,000 made Stockholm region rest Gothenburg Malmö. company performed half antibody tests Sweden 70 percent tests Stockholm region.

Those tested constitute representative sample population, chosen go test themselves.

\- lot healthcare staff, many risk groups, also anyone street. know broad group, exactly representative, says Henrik Forsberg, CEO Werlabs.

&amp;#x200B;

**Of tested Stockholm, 14.5 percent antibodies blood.** decrease compared weeks earlier 15.8 percent tested positive. period, 60,000 people tested.

In Gothenburg, results tests showed 15.1 percent antibodies recent period, increase compared period 14.3 percent received positive answer. Malmö, 8 percent tested positive recent period, decrease compared period 9.4 percent positive. significantly fewer tested Gothenburg Malmö, total 3,000 people. first opportunity last.

Henrik Forsberg want analyze explain proportion test positive fallen somewhat Stockholm Malmö.

\- assessors make better analysis. see measure figures. constantly share aggregated anonymous data Swedish Public Health Agency, says.

&amp;#x200B;

The Swedish Public Health Agency estimated last week 17.5 20 percent inhabitants Stockholm region may developed antibodies, higher figure Werlabs reports.

\- depends data base. make assumptions, tell among 80,000 took test three-week period, find 14.5 percent antibodies, says Henrik Forsberg.

A total 180,000 antibody tests booked Werlabs.

On August 10, Werlab begin testing five locations Skåne region collaboration Skåne region. Helsingborg, Kristianstad, Lund, Malmö Ystad, healthy asymptomatic least 14 days able get tested.

Residents Skåne region pay patient fee SEK 200 get tested. Booking made via 1177.

DN looking Public Health Agency comment. right. I’ll say it.

Oh since said ""Chinese-American"" means parents immigrated US. tell me, you/they come instead staying China? must reason... one huge majority selfish people country. probably anti-mask too. 300 million us? England buying 100 million 65 million people, buying four times are? store condones non mask wearing problem customers get angry enforcing mask rule.

The owner said thinks fine people take masks others stay 6 feet away like get phd? FedEx. wondering heck 16 people household, remembered ridiculous rent prices California.  Great, mean others fears, hard understand. exact shit anti-masks people say. Regardless feelings deal people legitimate fears anxiety extremely shitty people downplay make feel like fears real. understand guys calloused towards peoples fears anxiety, mental health crisis country tell people deal shit try make feel safe understood.

 face shield would better nothing people feel like going die every time put mask make others happy.

edit: word guys make fun predicted sub 3 weeks ago, would downvoted told effective lock downs been. 

People everywhere fucking stupid. abuse emotional support animal system proper service animal. Sadly, possible produce enough PPE linear production keep exponential virus spread. virus scales exponentially can't scale production like that. one many reasons virus needs suppressed lockdowns.  referring phase one two. phase three results even challenge tricky prove efficacy depends test. There's many them. effective others: Studies shown protests lead spike cases. cunt Dude. Masks much (and alot, better wearing one).

And Japan multiple times worldwide pandemic feel pretty confident wearing masks issue now.

Its probably people getting relaxed interact social settings. appease Republicans trying look good constituents (all giving Uber wealthy billions dollars tax cuts). miss living Germany, whenever compare something guys home country (UK) sigh, wish followed examples often. Great British public apparently good that. Even limited attendance mask requirements, many won’t follow we’ll people pouring over. isn’t good! 228+ million Americans?  going specific. live 250 new cases 50 deaths, really closer half both, month now. keep waiting either numbers positive rate go up, see fewer masks May June, happened. Fed printing money prop market, using money stimulus package. Businesses like Walmart need stop encouraging masks start mandating them. surprised Walmart hasn’t gone Costco route yet.  New strand COVID-19, whole different virus. clarifying. event let's go ahead remove cross fingers return. 🤞 Well, mine appetite start. it’s continuous 2 months, like returned 2 months. Sounds like California Anecdotal evidence accurate enough pinpoint percentage create statistical model long term effects. 

As today 8.5 million fully recovered COVID cases confirmed reports permanent long term effects. 

If long term effects common think would concrete hard numbers now?

""Potentially crippling entire generation"" makes sense consider world numbers: 15 million confirmed cases, 8.5 million fully recovered, 600K deaths.

World population? 7.8 Billion.  devil's soldier It’s schools.

Businesses open, including (really) late night ones, like Izakayas late night restaurants. shifts worked students attend university sit crowded unventilated labs days.

WFH staggered hours companies. malls, cinemas, sports venues BAU again.

Add safety measures enforced, like forcing restaurants open doors/windows ventilate (the government can, voted power, don’t want remunerate small businesses).

If add complete lack testing, government disbanding scientific counsel anti-coronavirus replacing political economy lobbies, end bad cocktail Japan. bought one right away soon knew it. He’s still thinking it’s flu trying prove it?
He’s gonna die rate eradicate viruses vild animal populations. Don’t mistake unvillingness pay campain would impossible. Well done, thank you! What's wrong discussing reality? ton stories people little symptoms. That's good thing, something cover hide. That's leads people claiming blown proportion. Uh, 30% population can't develop ""herd immunity"". herd immune, herd immunity. situation, 30% population would personally immune, virus would continue spreading outside 30% immunity fades able catch again.

Herd immunity happens much total population immune virus effectively dies out. data least enough us say ""Hey, maybe things getting better"" Regardless. Cf. Trump says knows ""more generals.""

Because Uncle MIT ""very good genes"" thinks knows scientists. Good one neighbor going Barre class, getting nails done, hair done, massages, waxing appointments, goes mets friends drinks fine...
She thinks blown proportion I'm stupid staying home, Covid thing preventing vacation Europe.

People bubbles, bubble get affected, think exaggerated. No, non-replicating viral vector. Wow, Canada get fancy active mask buck each, America, cannot find 3M N95 mask sale anywhere. Damn. didn’t realize. six days symptoms thinking clear :( ""masks recommended classroom.....but required""

New Jersey thing. teacher friends family getting wills prepared schools forced open September. called cytokine storm. generally dont wish Illll people fucker deserves mother cytokine storms skeptical.

The official ""Covid-19 death"" ""They got corona, even died obviously not-covid stuff, like getting shot car accident."". thanks fam!!! idea permanent people. Drs scientist aren’t sure- I’m glad came back haven’t gotten back. see people downvoting disagree. I, myself, think unemployment extended duration crisis. gotta foster discussions good faith people opposing views instead sides instantly giving mob mentality becoming divided groups. necessarily happening here, definitely happened country, everything. Also, PSA: Samsung phones built-in oximeters. 

I believe Apple Watch also oximeter unfortunately currently disabled regulatory reasons expected value (%of true positive)*(test true positive rate) + (%of true negative)*(test false positive rate). Therefore expected value true virus prevalence population always 30% 80% error decreasing like square root number tests. totally inconsistent observations various states. Article mentions survey done Yelp data drawn New York Times, links.

It’s 2020, every halfway decent periodical ability link sources. It’s asking much. tests would lead results. stop testing. know caught it? (Out curiosity) makes logical sense really something measure.

How fuck would measure reopenings huge fucking protests caused massive uptick somewhere like Dallas Austin?

Its flawed science pushing point, MASS GATHERINGS SPREAD IT. PERIOD.

The article uses ""some places protests didnt see surges"" say effect it.

Reopening happened earlier states fully reopen (Cali) also hit still... People stop going events. opening want money, care life. care life money, go. classist say family excessively large double average number kids live 16 people house. poor indictment you, many children abject poverty something kids. Imagine shilling country running Muslim concentration camps 2020. good look. 

Also, China leading pack, would reason IP except also definitely helps too. preliminary studies indicate masks prevent transmission person wearing significant %, even person gets sick get smaller viral load (so hopefully better chance fighting easily).

it definitely helps wearer! selfish fucks uneducated horrifically self absorbed. think he's thinking health professional, reminding people keeping virus bay require ongoing work. headline taken dire way. simply statement fact, sadly one many people realize. hear people talk ""when Corona virus over"" realize disease still exist, people stop getting vaccinations sort thing one available pandemic could return people part.

I mean could magically freeze everyone place 4 weeks, disease could effectively eradicated, long people stayed away animal vectors. even then, disease go away, least way many public think would.

People used fighting enemies see whose demise specific beginning end. killed Hitler, killed Hitler. diseases, there's endlessly reproducing invisible Hitlers require ongoing effort realistic end sight.

When couple fact Corona virus horrible, horrible visible way would like, instance, black goo movie *Covenant,* get people like Dan Patrick thinking giving letting people die effective strategy. People die Corona virus die way people seen sad, many scary enough change behaviors. 

I guarantee one symptoms getting corona virus culminated possibly creature burst chest, none fuckers would saying masks important, kids needed get back school people needed get back work...even end result exactly same: people dead transmittable disease. provide source here? I'm trouble coming anything accurately calculate it. Besides, that's really point argument. original comment said people realize poor Americans are, provided evidence Americans actually richer westerners. That's million dollar question. try stuff that's worked elsewhere--check great work happening Utah Colorado--but would scale order magnitude. take creative thinking. Well February March basically CDC, Fauci Surgeon general recommended wearing mask, can't really blame Trump that.

April really mask narrative started change, CDC Fauci starting recommend masks. Ireland Medical doctor leader, Germany quantum chemist there's Trump Ballsanaro failed disclose infectious disease.

Would defend someone failing tell sex partners hiv?

Troll ass understand 7 day average includes previous 6 days, usually lower PROGRESSION? Ex: seven day spread like 20, 25, 30, 40, 60, 80, 100 averages 50.7, half actual daily number 100 - keeps growing. point graph, 1/3 really 2/3, likely increase bit faster next days. havent tested. go work every day. ok though. im long :), actually kinda relaxing... totally agree. would rather business owners local government enforce mask rules federal government. 

However, I'm still unsure current goals. supposed trying stop virus tracks? Or, trying slow spread hospitals get overwhelmed? we're trying completely stop virus, I'd agree authoritarian avenue. we're keeping spread check, let rural areas get hit severe cases shipped better facilities.

I guess vaccine coming soon, though. Probably :( championing years, live it.

And now, instead conceding ""hey maybe championing wrong things, pushing wrong narrative"", they'd rather double complete assholes entire time.

Can't admit wrong. I’m moving Charlotte weekend. things there? really concerning. friend that's still fighting Covid symptoms March, barely walk minute without exhausted God damn read Great Depression actually made people *healthier* less money spend booze, smokes, hookers, etc. thats testing lacking probably hasn’t doesn’t mean shouldn’t taken serious virus Ah, yes; play Animal Crossing Troll elsewhere. Go back conservative bullshit subs Facebook. HCQ HCQ+AZTH showed significant effect viral load levels tested compartments. drug used pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), HCQ confer protection acquisition infection. findings support use HCQ, either alone combination AZTH, antiviral treatment COVID-19 humans. idea, thought. Might easier come agreement lower? Saves money.

I'm also unemployed rely money. anything come agreement I'm with. think response march virus spreading like wildfire knew next nothing treat it? however sick custody youd end hospital cuffed bed gen pop.

Quit fucking stupid lady aware extremely infectious disease kept secret.

Had least warned dozen half people infected would different.

How fuck think ok? fucking dense?

Have heard typhoid mary?

Maybe spend less time defending terrible people time educating reading long term effects likely happening people severe cases, it’s premature overdramatizes say “fucks survivors”. 

For know people permanent complications incredibly small number. Land size isn’t really correlative amount cases. Look map corona virus cases you’ll find almost trend all. What’s correlative (among things like general population) population density. considering NY density general urban areas vs California’s urban areas... it’s actually pretty surprising California overtaken NY.

Edit: relation US. comment underrated Instead getting tubes tied, replace conveyor belt system.  first nursing home outbreak Washington State. ~40 people died. think one thing Tegnell got 100% right asked ""why shut like EVERYONE else?"" beginning this. said something similar to:
We might. timing must right. cant lock people long wrong time agree right time.

I think see moment. Safe Stay = Stay Away  going magically create jobs? That's Democrats you. vaccine likely get covid point anyways so... think do. especially someone rolls,out phony vaccine cost [insert number high don’t even number high enough yet]. 

## Abstract

COVID-19 rapidly become pandemic antiviral drug vaccine yet available2–4. Several clinical studies ongoing evaluate efficacy repurposed drugs demonstrated antiviral efficacy *in vitro*. Among candidates, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) given thousands individuals worldwide definitive evidence HCQ efficacy treatment COVID-19 still missing6,7,17,18. evaluated antiviral activity HCQ *in vitro* SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques. HCQ showed antiviral activity African green monkey kidney cells (VeroE6) model reconstituted human airway epithelium. macaques, tested different treatment strategies comparison placebo, peak viral load, alone combination azithromycin (AZTH). Neither HCQ HCQ+AZTH showed significant effect viral load levels tested compartments. drug used pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), HCQ confer protection acquisition infection. findings support use HCQ, either alone combination AZTH, antiviral treatment COVID-19 humans. everyone stayed inside 2 months max. travel shut around world. Eradicated.  There’s always next time, virus comes along 99% mortality rate within 48hrs. Maybe world take things little serious. heard economy never better. seeing enemies there. Sure, responded Corona posts, indeed US terribly responding towards it. see malice, I'm merely talking terrible handling crisis. see whats wrong asking questions. trying understand country better well.

So curious asked handle sick days vacation days.

You might see ''mindlessly attacking Americans'' I've also posted shitton Americans probably following measures, acting like idiots. happens country well. really sound super defensive probably believe living greatest country Earth. ''But commenting much US?!?!'' not? basically leader world whatever happens country spirals towards lot nations. look BLM protests. I'm perfectly justified comment US. gatekeeper speak country. Grow up. Capitalism agree things. expect someone isolate detriment, cases possible. also expect people take reasonable precautions point fingers accidental transmission occurs. know, unnamed woman may even source infection. Contact tracing obviously used disclosure voluntary.

On flip side, roommates rights does. right protect themselves, right minimize exposure possible, right know exposure may occurred.

In likelihood, household infected chance disclose. delaying inevitable, endangered roommates possibly infecting them, delaying testing, possible treatment, contact tracing. endangered anyone may contact knowing situation. endangered giving roommates damn good reason kick out.

She made decisions could made roommates, suffered result. may reasons, far victim here. NY brilliant idea send COVID positive people BACK nursing homes.... huge chunk deaths came long term care centers...

I one seen 1st hand stupid government give benefit doubt NY goverment inept engage systematic eugenics intentionally. Well H1N1 vaccine millions doses discarded. Also, main worry would many different vaccines developed regarded much worse used all. again, price vaccines low case, especially compared damage caused COVID-19.   Israel supporters don’t understand west bank illegally occupied since 60s Amen. native I’ve seen even trump people style republicans taking virus far seriously president Free??? 1.96 billion isn’t free tax dollars. Already paid it.

Edit: mean free isn’t 1.96 billion. vaccines US paid develop free heavily discounted. Vero cell lines derived kidney African green monkey, tried use drug human lung derived cell lines failed show benefit. woman WAY 30lbs overweight... excerpt study mentions this? 


If say true suppose sound little sketchy link load you? load me.

It seems cannot access Lancet articles right now.

I train maybe problem? Maybe give title study Google it?

For ""mine"" show study someone presented days claim - ""37% COVID patients got neurological damage!""

The article - case series 214 patients coronavirus disease 2019, neurologic symptoms seen 36.4% patients common patients severe infection (45.5%) according respiratory status, included acute cerebrovascular events, impaired consciousness, muscle  Neurologic symptoms manifest notable proportion patients coronavirus disease 2019.

Ok .. sound scary, right?

So ""neurologic symptoms"" mean, study manifestations categorized 3 categories: central nervous system (CNS) manifestations (dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease, ataxia, seizure), peripheral nervous system (PNS) manifestations (taste impairment, smell impairment, vision impairment, nerve pain), skeletal muscular injury manifestations. Impaired consciousness includes change consciousness level (somnolence, stupor, coma) consciousness content (confusion delirium)

Ok .. technical words. many things actually ""light"", right? ""Headache"". ""Ataxia"" means ""loss coordination"" (you might expect lying bed 3 weeks, yes?). ""Somnolence"" means ""fatigue"". 

So lot things really serious complications. .. like ""seizures"" (Anfall) example.

But .. many people one? many people got ""headaches"" many people got ""seizures""?

So read patients CNS (ME = ""neurological"") manifestations, common reported symptoms dizziness (36 [16.8%]) headache (28 [13.1%]). patients PNS symptoms, common reported symptoms taste impairment (12 [5.6%]) smell impairment (11 [5.1%]).

Oh .. is. common reported ""neurological symptoms"" dizziness, headaches loss taste/smell.

So important ""extra bit information"", right?

It turns ..

""37% COVID patients got neurological problems!""

Into ..

""37% COVID patients got neurological problems! (Mostly headaches dizziness)""

And ... study even try show permanent long lasting.

So turns ..

""37% COVID patients got neurological problems *at hospital*! Mostly headaches diziness"".

And ... BIG claim ""37% COVID patients develop neurological problems!"" .. 

.. becomes much ^smaller claim.

Do see mean?  monkey thing cow btw people infected sue shit her. certainly would. find hard believe last campaign manager didnt suggest wel. likely, he’s finally realizing masks could actually help means reducing COVID numbers; it’s likely little late Consider anyway. years experience overtime make six figures nurse. ones geting tested ones hardest hit parts Stockholm. (imigrants) likely isnt right, admonishing people's desire knowledge bad

Nah, necessarily wrong, worse likely right. also argument propaganda swirls covid19.

If person actually wants know, could find one many articles quote actual experts saying virus getting weaker.

Spreading propaganda seeking knowledge ain’t thing.  Ouch.  Sad probably right. 10-14 day lag test results. current test numbers underinflated. Honestly summering north. see fly winter. gave pretty poorly explained example whatever point you’re trying make lol could educate people ask basic questions, instead assuming coming bad place.

Viruses mutate times mutations weaker strain. saying case, still valid question nonetheless confirmed cases! Stable genius. systemic failures America, personal ones. includes things like cancer course even millionaires go bankrupt treatment. buffets thing over? think people aware germ spread now, want avoid germs entirely. Here's thing. seen single high profile individual die Corona past months. Money simply cures Corona.  US could’ve corona virus rear view “in better spot” wouldn’t even factor. would getting excited school start worry “when” corona explodes schools teachers start dying/quiting. handle always sunny reference? wonder too. spend lot time outside winter summer. Summer Florida’s “winter.” It’s absolutely unbearable. wonder great! also ordered companies making them. I've curb-side pick local grocery chain months  I'm trying split hairs. person asking sounded like they're interested knowing percentage people meet danger them. busy memeing COVID babies realize going get COVID orphans...


This sort news saw China Feb. Children surviving entire family passed. many dismissed hoax/third world healthcare/never going come here. sad see happen us... us like - want progress, want see equality, want healthcare.

The scary part, REALLY scary part, slip authoritarian state, ruled egomaniacs christian alt-right, still largest arsenal world. still nukes anyone. aircraft carriers world combined. keeps night.. wrong hands, bring ""peace freedom"" rest world, honestly sure much anyone outside Russia could stop it. wouldn't. 


Quick edit: deployable nukes. Unless states take immediate action rollback reopenings many many months. think states see major improvements 2021. fall going brutal especially states opening schools enforcing rules. mean, antivaxers need one okay. biggest story news. Michael Mina, Harvard scientist, wrote piece New York Times weeks ago cheap, rapid tests, ""This Week Virology"" last week talking it, too. (See scientists PhDs really excited, called true game changer.

I'm average guy, specialty field, PCR test turnaround times week 10 days many places now, really feels like daily, one dollar tests answer. could open schools test kids door; open offices, send might spread virus home. could sports. could well way back normal things catch on. guess waiting FDA.

*There's reason government willing subsidize tests, really truly wants things open back up.* understand got downvoted. hurt someone's feeling again? Thank you! Another marker today, NJ reported 24 deaths...only 1 occured wonder many quit drinking well, specifically social drinker alcoholics. Oh, saying aren’t people many kids there, doesn’t sound like that’s case here. Rushing vaccine guess even California woman little Florida man know vaccine probably 50-70% effective even available late 2020/early 2021. plague hits kills predominately younger people like past old ass partying hard. “We don’t see cases people falling ill twice Covid-19,” state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell said press conference Stockholm. “Hence, assessment get Covid-19 immune, even don’t develop  two commissioners voted entire county defy shutdown orders resign, they're clearly unfit positions. punish people (who ultimately ones suffering this, regardless political views education) leaders' stupidity. problems funding pigs tho. Don’t see asking donations. Bro right. beat virus sauna heat shock proteins!  Well one protected people earth (talking virus) understand need always use it. us president needs portrait good image us residents. leader take seriously stuff, followers depends whether discussing R0 Re. R0 intrinsic virus, affected outside factors. affected outside factors (engineering controls, physical distancing, etc.) Um. Yes. suspect right. see pictures people out, cannot tell percent people actually going out. talk consequences people recieving false positive, mention consequences testing people actually positive. also hate bodily autonomy self-determination. read four books last summer anticipation watching show. heard ended, couldn’t continue reading series. There’s way I’d slog whole series see freakin’ Bran, people, getting throne. makes sense. Based pure statistics alone (9/10 tests come back negative), statement pure nonsense. I'm sure article still talking Phase results, Phase II results analyzing results Phase 2 testing comparison [results first phase took place late IUPUI researchers determined statewide estimate active infection rate 0.6 percent -- sharp decrease 1.7 percent observed Phase 1. estimate antibody positivity Phase 2 1.5 percent -- increase 1.1 percent Phase 1 results. ""

There's pretty big mismatch 2 phases. 2nd phase implied IFR 1.56%, much worse 1st phase. One phases off, enough information tell one. oh no! wow. that's beyond scary. sorry hear.   importantly, got right fuck way people around knowledge something say.

The health minister done well too. career he's nothing medicine he's either fast learner, well briefed. Probably both. He's almost daily televised briefings rarely needs look notes. bother answer English either. fuck down? You’re actually kidding, right? 

No, unhinged right resorting ad hominem attacks like accusing nazi.

So calm fuck stop acting like home. Give income. Stop going out. don’t NEED go shopping grocery store. There’s curbside pickup. don’t NEED go retailer. There’s online shopping. 

I already have, everyone else (though getting help feds saying). point think making live without income year, STOP going work. It’s dangerous you’re putting others risk every time step outside home.

I never said people without income year, insisting it?

And taken pay check since 2017, don’t like I’m saying, sincerely question insist putting lives others risk WANT walk store go work easily stay inside house year everything delivered door. 

This need calm fuck down. went rant demanding things already making assumptions things cannot possibly need willing sacrifice us, otherwise evil, selfish science denier.

Calm fuck explain science think denying. longer people disease likely go south, I'd wager. Longer hospital stays equated higher mortality rates recall correctly. rush producing vaccine asinine. know people want believe main reason news stock market. seen time time ""feels good news"" pushed assuage stock markets instability. hear form called ""good news"" pay attention stock market find ugly truth.

As vaccine December. possible.. takes long time create optimized vaccine. might getting half-developed product. Alabama one worst states healthcare education one highest obesity rates believe. end well unfortunately  Yup, live Utah feel like weirdo work kids. Everyone work older 20 kids, usually 4 5. One guy 32 14 year old already! look super stressed happy work home. One guy begged work office finally let him. Yeah, okay. emotional reaction somebody going work. People like get make tyrannical decisions lives others. latin cultures damn virus scary! get it? hope parents get it! Ya freakin' say. live Bay Area, too. also fucking up, SoCal fucking WORSE, focus failures. Saying better SoCal true also like bragging dog turd we're eating smaller dog turd they're eating. probably focus try stop eating turds, y'know? 65% particles go straight mask way deactivate virus.

It honestly makes difference people direct, prolonged contact infected patients. idea assume one day coat N95 masks used hospitals allow extended wear sanitization. advertising product misleading takes advantage consumers familiar, may even cause overconfidence leading higher chance infection even rudimentary cloth mask.  They're delayed customs rest Alibaba orders china. /s It’s failed, it’s exactly it’s always designed do. Transfer much wealth bottom possible damn costs. Small sample size/resolution creates large errors bars comparing data SoCal terribly point... happen? get downvoted every time complain people wearing masks. Even people covid-19 subs care anymore. Bet name Karen Pretty sure we’ve eradicated smallpox completely. exists labs now. live rock? best stat look excess deaths. includes deaths indirectly caused COVID well. lol well I'm glad comparing anti-mask people children generally agree though key differences.

However, children irrational fears work help overcome fears, instead letting fears control life. child fear dogs, reasonable strategy would help get acclimated dogs let understand nothing fear. go rest life afraid something generally harmless, could actually positive affect life.

These adults fear mask however little different. irrational completely idiotic fear *encouraged* people like you, addressed. Instead helping overcome irrational fear, apparently saying let spew 'rona place of... feels NEVER OK TELL SOMEONE FEARS BULLSHIT.EVER.

lol yes is. somebody afraid somebody they're woman need accept that? black? walking kinda fast? afraid wear mask accepted tolerated; ignorance fueled false information. call is: **bullshit.** Okay, get grown read wrote get explain word.. might help can’t believe getting downvoted. drove around town yesterday counted 18 shops gone outta business. Like, well could 18 families lost everything. 

Someone getting sick good. Losing livelihood isn’t good either. Govt supposed provide security failed fronts. Turns poverty breeds conditions allow debacles like spread uncontrollably ignoring doesn’t make go away. 

You guys get mad going work sick, it’d lot productive get mad company giving sick leave. Given choice homelessness going work sick, good luck everyone work cuz boss decided wants business run. Limited sick days would nice. manager either allows table, take vacation days. Two weeks works people apply it. didn't. Muh freedom. Right, sheep live without fear despite real danger well being. Living without thinking adjusting life external threats exactly living like sheep is, talking point used people live like sheep. think matters much. Europe eradicated rabies ensuring almost every fox, wolf dog vaccinate air dropping vaccine food pellets, mandating pet vaccinations. carpeted habitats coronavirus spreading bats vaccinated fruits?? would also work. 

Of course less lethal infectious virus higher percentage population needing immunity ensure eradication. idea corona-virus affects host bats spreads amongst bats. 

You're right rabies probably one easier viruses eradicate, (Only spread bites / 100% lethality / Kills quickly becoming contagious ). also one wild animal diseases elimination attempted. 

For Human diseases small pox spread quickly successfully eradicated, infectiousness disease matter everyone vaccinated.

Look... agree actually good sign. Trump actually changed mind something pretty much said wrong before. hasnt happened befotr, atleast know. fact goos America know right? Somehow makes sense ffs took 8 full days got results test mid June. second test one taking 10 days gotten yet. time get results probably halfway sickness. many like that? leads one willfully stupid? basically lost job home order follow instructions. 

See, easy point finger, things connected. seems stupid, possibly rational behavior person situation. millions situation U.S. Yes says Chris Wallace interview fox. Honestly even though it’s fox it’s great interview, Wallace play softball trump trump staggeringly stupid. Honestly interview somehow even lowered level intelligence thought trump (and already incredibly low). based think pandemics ended vaccines?

The problem every state own. wonder why...... yeah... job. health care. money food rent money.  Endemic means present one geographical area, much like endemic species. poster right endemic widespread. 

 
""In epidemiology, infection said endemic population infection constantly maintained baseline level geographic area without external inputs."" takes time manufacture, distribute, administer billions vaccine doses  best world.

But social distancing - enough matter.

We see lot statements like ""not obvious that"" - casting shade idea masks actually saying anything all.

What totally obvious letting locality choose _is working_. totally obvious thousand deaths day. one page. It’s hard people organized take serious, Governor tells us safe shit, goes attends Trump rally, maskless, big dinner outings multiple nights week. really feel like we’re here. pickup order curb.

How silly realised silly indexes world freedom realising Russia fact free country earth instead placing almost universally bottom end. Actually sounds like good idea. **Sounds**. Deaths far fewer European country well. survives, jail life. practically tried kill Arithmetic absolute least mathematics, that's what's funny personally.

the way things going

But pretty great collection masks. get tested! Feels like ignored science and, oh, basic fucking logic. Trying impose NYC solutions heartland 'rubes' make sense people resent, contempt urbanites.

Those people decided resentment long virus, denial, please play dumb get angry others playing along. kind obnoxious dishonesty lack personal responsibility affecting places much worse despite better potential distancing conditions far warning. Ten cents dance, back actual fuck. another one sickos abducts children what. think missing point article. point immediately reopen everything it, draw attention fact we're major mental health crisis likely self-harm incidences rise sharply. serious issue. trying correlate anti-spam feature social media website owned private corporation large-scale failure American educational system, news media, government general. That's particularly good comparison. Warappen mumz? clearly one couple’s children. She’s sharing house people, probably multiple couples multiple kids each. easier handle remote, sparsely populated areas anything. think *everyone* wants kids go back school, I'm guessing (especially children) want send back safely. 

The American Academy Pediatrics said must pursue re-opening way safe students, teachers staff. Science drive decision-making safely reopening schools. Public health agencies must make recommendations based evidence, politics. leave health experts tell us time best open school buildings, listen educators administrators shape it. portion population representative share virus means they're going spread place old people? Thank god Disney open! people saying we'd hitting 80,000 now? happened that? 2 weeks it’ll 2000 per day again. That's perfect!

None us mind readers. don't.

This debate March, made sense then. Maybe spreads much faster thought, therefore there's ""iceberg"" underlying infections know reduce IFR 0.1% less.

The debate made sense then, even early March could see deaths increasing 20-50% per day different countries. obviously thing spreads much faster thought, thought spread less 20% day. meant nothing mortality, meant short period act everyone it.

And, indeed, days later Europe acted. debate went window death 0.6% Bergamo.  Here’s problem, there’s lot people younger underlying Heath issues, diabetics, people immune compromised, people asthma, etc aren’t going able participate anything continue lock inside, won’t able work, go school, anything. It’s elderly vulnerable, everyone who’s vulnerable told they’re supposed stay locked vaccine comes out, really don’t choice, lot us vulnerable develop complications we’re exposed, we’d stay inside even longer even though there’s vaccine available. also gonna take vaccine it’s available either!! feel relevant ..

[Tests may miss 1 5 COVID-19 team Johns Hopkins Medicine found PCR-based tests SARS-CoV-2 false negative rate least 20%, depending time testing.

It appears virus detectable immediately infection. first day infection, probability missing diagnosis, i.e., false-negative result, 100%.

At day 4 exposure virus, probability false-negative result seems reduce 67%. day 8, decreases 20%, beginning increase afterward. 3 weeks postexposure, chance false negative result reaches 66%, authors estimate.

The results indicate virus difficult detect RT-PCR days immediately following infection, suggesting testing route offers limited value period (3–5 days postinfection).

The authors recommend making major decisions, removing personal protective equipment (PPE) ending quarantine, based results obtained period. Similarly, test offers limited value long time initial exposure. I’ll take “what’s literal least do” thousand, Alex. lose neo cold war! /s Florida really slowed down. California bag now. call security-theater.

Some find uncomfortable fatiguing.

Some simply want wear mask demand abridges freedom choice matter.

These risks consider. fuck sake, yes 0.65% now. CDC updated. Double estimate. 10 percent corona, 10 percent toward homelessness, 10 percent toward universal health care, 10 percent education, 10 percent toward national debt. know math probably doesnt work alot things reconfiguring country spends money could much many people. even start stop military budget, could many different things. *easter 2021 I’m really insulting people, matter true something may be. helps one. Little 10 financial industry going implode without effective vaccine could hand discovering. 

W/ little 3 weeks loose antibodies, could years there's even cocktail could take.

Call crazy, think might lesson free market work goin' here. Hidalgo county didn’t even report cases deaths last 24 hours. worst hit area country. laughed *wayyy* hard Consider cost shut economy vs cost get everyone wear mask. Looks like people going lots freedoms (and free time).  new normal bit. We’re still + two weeks 4th July. orange guy tv said America lowest death toll, understand! Sad. think something else driving win re-election president anymore, protections political party brought him, kin likely get heavily severely prosecuted. doesn’t explain we’re still seeing 60,000 cases every day European countries seeing hundred. spread what’s really control here. Yeah, doesn’t help U.S. embarrassingly unhealthy compared wealthy nations, obesity diabetes don’t cause catch virus, make severe case likely. ""Gawrsh Mickey, kinda like genocide?""

except steps. think many anti-maskers sincerely believe media lying efficacy. He's piece shit. Assuming minute school switched virtual learning, would work elementary kids? Zoom calls? Assigned readings? According website follow 6 12 percent actual infections right now. They've got thing wheels days... need shut counties. People counties running still open spreading virus.

Worse yet. place work trying force us stay open shut orders. essential slightest bit, arent even getting hazard pay. [Trump Seen Event Without Mask Hours Saying It’s ‘Patriotic’ Wear School listed.

Trump 74 Biden 77. whole lot people consider elderly important actually people hold power world make decisions millions people. Elderly people need medical care unprotected people filling doctor's waiting rooms good anyone else. elderly classed vulnerable along young people health problems like diabetes high blood pressure. individual needs rather age social/employment status.  Seriously. They, Walmart, McDonald’s, etc open fuck full blast give crazies want. OP named several. instance, measles smallpox used occur epidemics sufficient non-immune population existed area (due birth children exposed disease, immigration, etc.). enough people exposed, transmission drastically slowed (herd immunity) population mostly spared disease. natural cycle many epidemic diseases, especially crowd diseases civilization. 

Herd immunity epidemics naturally come end. mean disease completely goes away, moves certain population (but may circulate back population people lose immunity, new people born, etc.). mean eradication. 

I can't believe OP downvoted they're 100% correct. Armchair epidemiologists thread. :/ echo Trump's words positons regular basis sudden concerned legitimate sources? Issues social media rather science journal? reinvest money defunding police? screw military? mean Democrats thing Republicans do. Pull wool eyes pretend ""their side"" fucked up. long term consequences still might dying doesn’t mean easy. Welcome politics buddy. thing people care getting re-elected, say whatever takes try win voters political party backs them. Money power.  
I strongly urge research candidates vote. take say face value. Easter. state? 6/50 bad! mean, he's deluded idiot. I'm surprised all. Wtf going Mexico majority voted democrats, can't wait see nothing change either Trump Biden. litmus test prove well parties nothing upcoming housing apocalypse covid-19 bill August. hero, thanks bud. case yes are. saying politicians always abide constituents? usually garbage. case yes. 

If want grab articles, might reflective every district. many want kids going back school. think polls nationally somewhere like 53% want kids go back school. districts 70-80%.

Whether it’s right wrong, idk. majority wants it. money come somewhere either add national debt future generations raise taxes. little afraid talk non-positive statements China heavily voted sub (and knows else?) agree maybe 50%. 

You're right cultural thing, know government ccp, going change SARS taught us anything.. ask many people change cultural lifestyle short time? fact, id say good chance people forget, wet animal market reopen domestic pressure (like last time) Basically, there’s broad immunity coronaviruses general. Antibodies created immune system specific SARS COV2 created specifically strain. time fade, durable immunity remains, meaning immune system able respond challenged virus again. Think memory cells. problem, looks like took time didn’t wanted go missing! amazes cognitive dissonance people claim that:

1) Masks ineffective viruses small filtered 

2) Masks bad health increase CO2 levels trap CO2

So masks can't stop ~120nm viruses, stop ~240pm CO2 molecules? Something that's 500 times smaller?

Which it? masks ineffective (and thus increase CO2 levels) masks increase CO2 levels (and thus must least efficacy stopping virus)? can't ways without serious mental gymnastics.

Also, viruses re-breathed, mean spread people much? User name checks would great took cops disrupting peaceful protests stationed entrance every store enforce mask laws, way us underpaid employees won’t keep taking abuse. Outside home Right, longer building wall, money reallocated. Oh god.

I work Florida hospital.

Florida 20 million

Less 2% tested positive

Only small percentage people get tested, real positives probably like 15%

Exponential growth exists

The vaccine coming soon enough

The toaster fire take long become house fire. Fire department might get 5 minutes. gets 10 that's big difference exponential growth. 140K higher total kill count individually Americans 10 12 major wars. WW 2 American Civil War deaths top 400k 650k (I feel last one kinda really count, merges federal confederate deaths US).

It also larger sum combing killed US revolution, 1812, Spanish American, Mexican American, Philippine American, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan.

Standing alone, killed COVID World War 1. five months versus twelve.

As gross population percentage, American Wars killed less 0.40% population.

Big ole nothing burger. Stone Temple Pilot? generation could learn something her.  suspect IFR ~0.8% play devil's advocate:

- antibody studies include T-cell immunity potentially people infected showing antibody studies

- coronavirus might ripped vulnerable populations first, like nursing homes, might see initially high IFR gets lower time (same treatment getting better) Here's Florida's latest case/death charts control, particularly 7-day moving death average. think edgy. seems like reasonable response correction? original post simply satire. Side effects last day self-limit. Covid kill you. bit? mean spearhead lead effort. Commander facilities resources like war time.

I know agreement company got tax payer money. right: sell cost people world right vaccine. Yet know neither reality. Yea, I’m ideal world people would listen doctors said, depend solely president relevant education comes virus.

Again part misinformation. “Omg hospitals getting full!” Meanwhile one asks baseline much “almost full”.

One two hospitals full doesn’t mean entire country fucked.  know news reports fast tests approved FDA recently, don’t think anywhere U.S. (outside White House ) get results quickly. Currently, get test, takes 2-3 days. fast test utilized U.S. would game changer, support that, I’ve seen. instance, could test people entering school, office, place work beginning day. Sweden kinda baffles I'm also epidemiologist. Seems like major outlier outbreak seemed last bit longer mortality rate higher neighbors. comparable Britain Italy surprising.

What fucky virus. hope true immunity taking hold Sweden. wait 🤷‍♂️ Well well well, turn tables. Huh, thought wear one clashed desk something? Seem recall comment specific office power said inappropriate? “As people go indoors hot weather rebreathed air fraction goes up, risk infection quite dramatic,” Nardell said, adding data, gathered related tuberculosis, would apply infection airborne title goofed up.

Italy refuse can. Greece Turkey already problem dealing Syrian refugees they've already accepted want accept more. Russia better covid, actively influenced US elections laws homosexuality real democratic process I'm going rule out.

The Nordic countries might accept want to. Plus tend low population, low density populations, good welfare would worried migrants coming take advantage. rule Iceland population 300,000. Greenland ruled well population 56,000.

The issue Syrian refugee crisis 5.6 million people. Syrian population 21.36 million peak 2010. US country 15.4 times bigger, we'd expect 86 million refugees(obviously **way** complicated this, boats cause bottleneck, back napkin calculation), that's one European nation Russia. Even accepting country can't afford double population needs spread out. Even spread evenly among 17 countries might accept any(Canada, Mexico, Ireland, UK, France, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark , Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand), completely ignoring massive objections fact Italy Germany say landing shores (Italy might shores strait Gibraltar, Spain might funnel refugees there). That's still 5 million refugees each, similar amount refugees entire Syrian refugee crisis per country. US migrants would immediately become major part every countries population naturally every single country would refuse many could. Expect route citizenship become harder prevent US citizens becoming sizeable voting block ""they messed country, let mess ours"".

The issue US massively educated population compared European countries, anything offer except load largely obese migrants jobs already taken. They'd massive health issues non-zero percentage dealing post covid long term health issues (1% US population already caught covid). ignoring fact every country world going recession debt. Ignoring almost certain crash world markets US goes down. There'd mass issues US immigrants bringing covid ""we've already worked hard defeat covid, really want undo that"".

Basically world becomes unwelcome place become refugee, no-one wants accept many.

It good news helps control spread virus sad considering many people would infected dead talk earlier. Immunity isn’t inherited. fact population develop herd immunity pandemic event doesn’t prohibit bacteria virus hit geographic area decades centuries later. live Zone 1 Central London, literally next door Tower Bridge. Even height lockdown (if could call that), area completely packed people. 

I'd go run times per week weave people sat everywhere drinking carrying on. Narcissistic dumbasses particular. ones insist knowing ""better"" experts every day living. Chinese news states that, retribution China requiring US diplomats test PCR entering Wuhan. America like teenager throwing tantrums. good look.

Then nope. They're definitely **not** 1%. airplanes, yachts, islands, sports cars etc. live glamorous life either. middle class Europeans living way many do. Definitely poor, certainly ""very wealthy"" u/mmmikeyddd put it.

Neither China U.S. announced reason time, headline information came news, officially confirmed

The Ministry Foreign Affairs China responds follows.

U.S. demands China close Consulate General Houston Wang Wenbin: Strongly condemns, China make proper necessary response

Q: According Foreign Ministry Spokesperson's Office, regular press conference Foreign Ministry July 22, reporter asked: According U.S. sources, Chinese Consulate General Houston asked close 4 p.m. July 24, consular staff asked leave. Chinese side confirm this?

Answer: Wang Wenbin: 21 July, United States side suddenly demanded Chinese side close Consulate General Houston, unilateral political provocation launched United States side Chinese side, serious violation international law basic norms international relations, serious violation relevant provisions Sino-American consular treaty, deliberate attempt undermine Sino-American relations, outrageous unreasonable act. China strongly condemns this. China urges United States side immediately rescind erroneous decision. Otherwise, China certainly make legitimate necessary response.

&amp;#x200B;

For time now, U.S. government constantly shifting blame China, launching stigmatizing attacks China, unprovoked attacks China's social system, making things unreasonably difficult Chinese diplomatic consular personnel U.S., intimidating questioning Chinese students studying U.S., confiscating personal electronic equipment, even detaining reason all. U.S. unilateral time-limited closure Chinese Consulate General Houston unprecedented escalation U.S. actions China.

&amp;#x200B;

China always adhered principle non-interference internal affairs countries, infiltration interference internal affairs countries never part China's diplomatic DNA tradition. China's diplomatic missions United States always committed promoting mutual understanding friendship peoples China United States. China facilitates performance duties U.S. diplomatic offices personnel China accordance Vienna Convention Diplomatic Relations Vienna Convention Consular Relations. contrary, U.S. side twice imposed unwarranted restrictions Chinese diplomatic personnel U.S. October last year June year, repeatedly opened unpacked Chinese diplomatic pouch seized official supplies Chinese side. Chinese Embassy United States recently received bomb death threats Chinese diplomatic posts personnel due recent reckless stigmatization incitement hatred U.S. side. U.S. Embassy's website Beijing regularly publishes blatant articles attacking China. contrast, facts clear interfering internal affairs countries engaging infiltration confrontation.

&amp;#x200B;

The U.S. side claims U.S.-China relations equal, usual U.S. excuse groundless. fact, terms number U.S. Chinese embassies consulates other's countries number diplomatic consular personnel, U.S. side far outnumbers Chinese side.

&amp;#x200B;

We urge United States side immediately rescind erroneous decision regard. United States side persists, China certainly take resolute measures response. Yes countries even common, everyone family living town even street building. feasible today, hey, free babysitting care sick. Looks like hostage video I'm sure sick time. hope general antigen tests sensitive, although tend run faster. run flu strep tests via antigen lateral flow assays. 90% sensitivity using automated reader opposed 99% PCR. That’s downside. 
There aren’t many LFA COVID out. Especially would trust results on. think quidel one reader FDA approved. going production bottlenecks PCR based tests though. Victoria, Australia, don’t access paid sick leave job you’re waiting get test result, government gives $1500 help cover lost wages. announced today stop exact situations... sorry government taking better care citizens. We've done many parents , grandparents. 

but appreciate sympathy lot things sort post-pandemic america. simply can't go back things were. likely case here. typically see workplace environment. easy spot. Yes surely help 11 kids needs provide for. testing companies sitting asses since March? companies making masks PPE, N95s common surgical masks now? think people like problems run deeper Covid penetrate. Quite! big mozzarella listening! Well, read Might case, maybe processing queues tests. Idk enough tbh really argue that.  Took 13 days get results Idaho May. high fever shortness breath. Took 13 days work, get pay results negative. work pharmacy; nobody wants get tested unless absolutely to, can't afford take time results come back negative. shitshow. article undercuts point.

He ""recommended"" immediately said it. entire article various instances downplaying wearing mask.

It's akin doctor recommending smoking crushing pack day front you. ""You smoke... smoking really good. think there's real evidence smoking helps. I'm going still smoke. might smoke even more. yeah smoke. do. choice. I'm going to.""

If friend get result sounds like admin incompetence rather timeframes 11 children. Someone needs tell Christians condom is. Stay Classy California. comparing us states, sure we're amazing hold worst best. Optimism great thing fear also side effect increased loss caution amongst many people. 

As much fear mainly looked root many problems, case actually somewhat required get majority act accordingly pandemic. fear personal suffering possible death causing another one things help perpetuate people make right choices general intelligence. Personally boringest five months life mantra worth unnecessary indoor gatherings crowded outdoor gatherings risk getting others infected.

So please whenever considering taking unnecessary risk can't manage find contentment home remember, virus started one single infection look state world now. know boring home year boredom well worth life time better health peace mind responsible infecting potentially killing another. go inside place shit piss, yeah. want chance it, maybe get lucky. maybe get unlucky... Thousands people getting unlucky every day. Atleast flying. want do. you... saying, everyone took thing seriously, even need vaccine. virus could've snuffed months ago. completely obvious get go. Im sorry friend.
I always looked America wanted live there. dream millions live there. millions envied Americans ppl could live America become American.

Unfortunately today America become biggest joke really sad see. bestest testing everywhere. 
It’s records only. one really seems care shit show. President trump, Ha! He’ll never president. That’s mainly I’m English live side pond men that’s whole point. rise cases consistently past weeks, could attributed Memorial Day weekend. Deaths rise cases. cases cases couple weeks ago Memorial Day Weekend. (If Memorial Day Weekend infects whole bunch people, doesn’t stop - people infect others, infect etc meaning here, weeks later, still experiencing effects Memorial Day Weekend: including slowest lagging indicators - rising deaths, rising steadily past week also.)

Even so, despite - I’m actually hesitant attribute much anything Memorial Day Weekend. It’s much easier attribute simply fucking stupid Americans appear past month so, particularly leadership positions. Memorial Weekend not, it’s fault.... got test CVS took 21 days results investing lab capacity, I'd bet cut enormous checks executive cronies last 4 months. That’s get social safety net work survive, even sick :( surprised find next year actual count 3-5X higher. someone explain running green golf yellow? Running breathing heavily possibly onto people around/passing golf common touch points eliminated courses allow ride walk uphill. he’s already prepared that. That’s he’s already saying election results fake mail voting. knows he’s going he’s going every thing delegitimize election results maintain power. Fauci literally testified senate likelihood underestimating death toll. know get much clear that? people absurd believe anything step one absences education. step two get married.

wait 10 years 11 kids. grim  I'm sorry, BrightShart ""news,"" mentioned breath legitimate news outlets. Yeah headlines make seem like people loads options irresponsible, reality lot time they're thing support family. Gotta get perfect score right? testing stupidly low huge delays said 1 person 1 case, I'm pretty sure briefing said 1 positive 1 positive, still counted tests separate 1 person. that's article says, supposedly clarify (Dr Christ) said though. Hence confusion. certain. almost 1200 deaths today. see 2000 deaths again, whole narrative certain sides/people trying push go right drain displaced Korean foreign exchange student stay family month last year. mailed us hundreds surgical masks Covid hit glad. prepare. rather administration did. They've successfully overseen rapid spread Trumpvirus United States. actual gameplan. going make great fucking movie day. Nationalism China probably would good strategy didn’t shitty job. Calling “China virus” isn’t enough either. didn’t turn animosity China he’s scared Xi. Yeah, agree there. say? Something best laid plans mice men... Temp scans show asymptomatic folks. wear mask drinking? actually think military’s budget 25,000x greater entire GDP Earth? Land ~~the free~~ ME. oh lives levittown...its quiet area If
#SHE
Can it
#YOU
Can spend time, asks Georgia. Well suing cities prevent enacting mask mandates, that’s how. Peachy keen I'm struggling see lessening spread coming from, though.

They shut bars texas, mask orders place cali getting aggressive. might causing drop, maybe noise/reporting. Cases spiking old south, population lot less FL, CA, TX. Fake account, reported. 

And Russians trying influence social media BS trolls **years**. Except action taken. I’m wondering base react flip flopping masks? gonna suddenly smarten wear daddy says so? idiots must sooo confused This! hugging kids extra hard tonight. poor woman family cannot even begin imagine pain going through. hail lizard overlord.

Or deep state crab people.

*Sigh* wack anyway. Better later never guess. Meh. Drive-in would less hassle. You’re hilarious 😂😂😂 exponent assigning that? realize exponents huge variation? Exponents fractions.

Typically exponential growth (the kind trying hard infer) require values continue increase, increased previous time point.

The data clearly indicates cases consistent at, average, 60,000 14 days. way linear increase, exponential.

Rapid rates change lead increased linear numbers, something happened here, incorrectly ignored.

Just rates may gone short period rapid increase mean still are. data clearly indicates.

Also, deaths seen significant increase prior time points (on average). really would want ask increased cases correlate increased deaths. Actually, you’re right. wrong that. don’t think that’s small good show, learned something today. 

I think 600 billion year something never gonna use bit overboard what’s worth. Canada must watching horror thinking fuck America done say people wear masks, never going force it? Member Trump 'joked' slowing testing.

It joke. Pray government learned things American government learned.  Glad got late. would one thing screwed always seems like take everyone around collateral damage. part healthy understand? It’s person launch space. Yea get Americans Hawaii! /s That's right! woman do? We've done terrible disservice Believe not, Putin's Russia Communist China even worse. America  far perfect, Americans good guys. I'm saying non-American. Ha ha expected june jobs creation total dire, bang! 5 million jobs. makes everything worse actually is. US 4.25% world population, yet 26.7% worlds COVID cases.

Wear fucking masks. bugs infographics. Grocery shopping may lower risk consumers, doubt workers. hear Big Five Dark Triad traits lot psych research. They're empirically based backbone personality psych, nothing like horoscopes. TLDR whole world scary, leave house election year over. Worldometer 1002 July 15th (just saying technically accurate) trend definitely right 2020 peak lmao. Remarks comes day study shows candidate developed CanSino China’s military research unit safe induces immune response  say ""bingo"". also come issue early lockdown creating problems, especially seen Southern US. possible go back lockdown regions people likely follow it. seems small window lockdowns effective. Something rotten Denmark here.

First Trump Kemp? Something must really alarming them. Multiple people organizations dropped ball.

As far first couple sentences, understand point There’s plenty places hiring, checked indeed ziprecruiter? fact there's 65k+ excess deaths still looms though Thank suggestion fact people can't afford even $55 month. agree choices highly affect abilities, never take first step never get anywhere. point country right now, many can't afford take step. take current situation example. got laid off, fully plannd go back school full time, figured time blows I'd good position. health decided differently. I've improved, I'm facing fact may need go back work order survive. I've able gather small savings gone flash something happens can't rely that.

There always steps take reach goal choose quality life, survival. everyone rock hard work ethic one million, case, ratio would change.

I'm defeated. get goals eventually understand infuriating live country promises everything, pulls away every time reach it. People give that's laziness, lost hope. try hardest never get anywhere, start feeling worth effort.

Thus country broken hopes dreams 90% citizens. years before? many people die order us take things seriously?  always data wrong doomsday predictions? like April Medical lab scientist here: confirm. Abbott testing, another one back order. ordered 6 months ago, whole thing kicked off. We’re expecting til next year. 

Talked Roche guy today, they’ve sold entire production line 6600s 8800s well MagNA pure 96, 

They sold buyback pre used machines well. 

The German factory basically max capacity, betcha America isn’t first list new unit comes Line. 

We’re testing fast possible, reagents source entire country needs them. 

Supposedly FDA managing get spread point. haven’t gotten full order months. 

From amp packs, extraction reagents, even fucking viral transport medium short supply. 

At least face masks, gloves lab coats now. graphic, low category don’t think necessarily. Deaths lag cases case explosion saw June resulting deaths. I’m sure deaths also get reported later don’t think that’s rule (maybe like deaths lagged reported weekend don’t think general last Tuesday’s deaths) week saying always masks Ya' say. you? Anyone know DND stoned 5 people fit in? Obviously illuminati killed her...

/s Dial back. I'm private practice Dr. manager insisted covid tests without providing ppe. He's antimasker. National Guard sent thank god could least get tested. 
It lowest ""military"" type experience. people hazmat suits/respirators. Hard talk w bc motorcycle people hitting laps 130 150 easy. Grocery store nearby party parking lot. Cop car left running. 
It wild mind militarily. typed deleted three responses realizing could night giving examples correct. Pretty sure places Florida got first. state guys in? pass, guys stay quarantined like 10 days go see them? hope gets better you... tough ages. damn skippy! best part abductions 100% FREEEEEE BABY!!! Suck Red White Blue DICK!11! Doesn’t dude straight allow United States’ puppet roam street campaign him? Venezuela? doesn’t silence anything. 2cm hole you? heck crossing border closed? Oh! hospitals lacking? Yeah no. people cross ok going pirvate hospital fraction would pay states, poor use public hospitals also bad FREE. Source: mom aunt retired nurses Straight jail thx 52% it’s 16%. :( You’re comparing 2 single schools entire districts across country. Healthcare workers nursing homes get higher priority us hospital workers. Beyond that, much depends well vaccine works elderly immunocompromised. (So far looks like Oxford vaccine work even host immune system weak, never know get stage 3 data) works well them, nursing home residents next. major hospitals outbreaks since universal masking went effect, afford wait. overwhelmingly blue one. left right away went elsewhere. bars area rightfully pissed. surprised disappointed see complete disregard there. Dude even get 3 hours reality disproves happy talk. lack basic foresight people amazing sometimes. something wrong tests giving Florida. False positives in: sociopaths exist! Wow intelligent highly scientific refutal scientific fact! must PhD PragerU imposed lockdowns late. Northern Italy [March (followed entire country two days later), UK [March (made enforcable March 26). going lockdown, countries already [hundreds seems play big role well. People short memory, definitely work think point poll results going start shifting. reddit hates South  age ranges?  one's terribly surprised slowing.

Why surprising? oh fuck. hurricane season *really* gets going weeks.

 might a....slight problem. lol live BC, excites me

Oh, wait, I’m fourteen. 

*shit* I’m confused gotta honest idea you’re saying.

The military budget 54% Federal Budget. sure you’re saying that’s small. time period anything? said it’s game nukes that’s exactly point reiterated point.

Either you’re drunk idea you’re talking about. Tubman run underground railroad lead armed expedition Civil war ended freeing 700 slaves. first woman lead expedition.

She also sort spy. fed intelligence northern military happening south. all, covertly moving back forth whole underground network traffic people. perfect person spy. real substantial opinion argument, adults waiting Trump called ""Emergency "" meeting exact time Fauci going throwing first ball Nationals game.  twit fire team player. Canadian here, look Americans allowed past border travel DIRECTLY Alaska Washington. honest well behaved, MANY caught hanging around within Canada, sightseeing shopping correct (which seems less certain based replies) would essentially mean could expect get virus every two half month finally get serious case end ventilator and/or die. realize they’re estimating numbers? factual evidence around 4% mortality rate, that’s statistical evidence on. 

Is undoubtedly lower? Yes. number largely human inference, assumptions beliefs put it? Sure. 

I mean know sounds minute difference talking .25 .6 discussing millions people, actually quite huge. 

If it’s .25 means roughly 16x amount people infected. That’s saying roughly 16-18% population Covid. 

That’s huge stretch. low end everyone catches mortality rate .25% that’s still 800,000 people. 

I don’t get point you’re trying make But...is fire hot? People area aren’t wearing masks like should. Narcissistic : see Donald J. Trump.

According Mary Trump, Donald cut family business provided health insurance diseased Brother Fred Jr.'s infant child born chronic health problems. Leaving Fred's newly widowed wife fend herself.

Does anyone think anyone's wellbeing mind even tiniest bit? Well. Yea, except it’s like Gynavirus. “Think stupid average person is, realize half stupider that.” - George Carlin Deranged. amount disinformation people spread fb. scary start trying call China virus? Lol zing OK Randy, take seat. ""Oh I'm sorry, thought America!"" I’m skeptical too. believe death count higher reported. provinces like though, quebec 4-5 hour wait apparently. states knocked infection rate manageable levels? level papering actual mistakes mind-boggling. Either something changed, study wrong, there's something tri-state makes covid worse... Let bearer bad news. happened previous ""White House Coronavirus press conference"". NBC News said appeared MyPillow infomercial. Heres CBS said: 

""The CEO MyPillow — one group business figures invited meet President Trump — took moment appearance Monday's [White House coronavirus press read something said wrote ""off cuff."" said God graced country President Trump — Americans reading Bible quarantine.

""God gave us grace November 8, 2016, change course on,"" Mike Lindell said Rose Garden podium. ""God taken schools lives. nation turned back God. encourage use time home get back Word, read Bibles spend time families.""

Standing next Mr. Trump, Lindell said president ""gave us much hope"" praised economy pandemic. ""With great president, vice president administration great people country praying daily, get get back place that's stronger safer ever,"" Spain Mediterranean climate cant compared tropical climate summer time.

Mediterranean actually perfect open air/no AC.

.That mild compared 90s-100s get US. Nope-it found stools infected people meaning survives stomach acids-and yes, live, infection causing amounts found.... Act offences could result six months prison $750,000 fines.

Is USD CAD? Yes emergency field hospitals setup Central Park, javits center, huge naval ship-turned-hospital, maybe places. barely used decommissioned within month. Oh, learned lots stuff. Beginners French, American Revolution, basic electronics. didn’t learn anything lessons lessons useless. teachers totally checked barely covered anything. might well let watch movies day. media remarkable ability program even think process argument, it?

I think also fair important question sources day age well. need better job, even means dismissing something might initially agreed face value source credible. MEE accused funded Muslim Brotherhood Hamas counterbalance Al Jazeera English based middle east 'news' UAE, Saudi Arabia western critics. things consider! Sounds like capitalism might high-risk activity. I'm certain high percentage minorities catching virus tend low wage / essential workers may unable take time they're sick. similarly, feel like CA's rising numbers least half driven workers get job take home, idiots without masks. \* Millions sick Americans That’s talk man. He’s head deeper Hilary. 

Do problem lies president tells every time opens mouth? What’s sad, know people say global plot get office (they clearly insane). say could easily done right thing, kept people safe severely damaged economy go history good president wiping away much wrong done, instead chose ignore hope went away late. Depending efficacy vaccine. definitely Projection x 1000 category that's America trying push weight around again. I'll save time. 31% believe number deaths smaller. Coincidentally, that's number people Trump's base.

Also, people skeptical watch Fox News. Basically it. usually view face mask-wearing sort “loyalty” test President. since President tweet wearing face mask “patriotic” wonder followers comply since *Dear Leader* wore one? mention 'terrorist' type behavior, kill everyone. 

I find amazing always first. one try meet threaten hurt called punk ass wanting wear mask. another tell state governor tyrant forcing mask mandatory. definition tyrant cruel oppessive ruler, something else, beleive ""traitor"" wanted. Til rosie riveter still alive Perhaps Overton Window, Trump conditioning general public tolerant tragic news. expect hear Trump always big supporter masks mandate believes decision state governors decide.

First ""masks work"" ""I support choice""

These people ridiculous. That's lab confirmed cases &amp; apparently 4 counties reporting data.

Sticking lab confirmed cases thing ridiculous. flu deaths.

By counting lab confirmed cases &amp; expanding lab capacity fast enough meet demand, numbers needlessly suppressed. Well there's brown people hate bomb this, so...

If discovered COVID actually Iranian bio-weapon designed inflict harm Europe America, get lot people incredibly concerned blood, know we'd invade dismantle WMDs. Even though good research would show probably actually Saudi Arabia fault anyone else... never mind that. OK Nixon [sabotaging LBJ's Vietnam peace enabled this.

Were good Reagan [sabotaging Carter's efforts get Iran hostages enabled this.

Were good [George Bush, Bill Barr's direction, pardoning everyone involved Iran-Contra effectively ending enabled this.

Were good John Boehner [passing tobacco lobby checks House enabled this.

Were OK Mitch McConnell [blocking Merrit Garland saying enabled this.

Were OK Newt Gingrich's *entire fucking career*?

#You enabled this.

I'm takling Coronavirus. I'm talking entire clusterfuck Trump presidency. result party's policies since Barry Goldwater 1964. give fuck Democrats; they're corrupt want too. stop trying fucking deflect.

#You. Enabled. This.  Ok guess go live hole logic walking outside, going grocery shopping, staying home unsafe. least, ppl r wearing masks. Meanwhile… Fair enough, going purely I've read Florida one. 

Regardless, testing create cases, please repeat false narrative. Positivity rates climbing... Testing keeping up, cases missed every day. Thats exponential growth works. say, \[insert country\] hits new high \[x number\] cases, every country every day. exceptions. There’s way numbers don’t correlate massive influx tourism/vacationers quote idiotic statements? That's going make valid. designating terms relevant argument uses word ""minimum"". Best idea yet. think numbers start improve drastically. States longer reporting numbers CDC. much winning. Black Chinese gangsters. Duh. yes, part research done Wayne Laboratories, learned fight dark triad us. deep knows going 'go away', least election time.

He really thought drinking bleach gonna silver bullet one point. Spitting someone pandemic immediately made attempted murder crime. A-hole. think I’ve learned politics last 3 months years combined. Turns out, politics enraging subject.

Actually, you’ve learned wrong way play politics. play politics welfare, gun rights, taxes... real people dying terms hundreds thousands, best resort fix problem die trying. guess someone told he's going lose election keeps ignoring COVID-19 Texas too. I’m Texas teacher I’m incredibly worried. wishes states would pay attention.

Starting state. passed* dementia test!

\* difficulty admission. Fine accept risk. Nothing chart listed “fine”. loool Good. We’ll finally get herd immunity get thing. close... Screw it. Let's start this. 

Life mystery... surprised all. I'm epidemiologist also kid narcissist. Every conversation father anything else going world-not since pandemic started, always way. there's current event, him. 


So, comes COVID, asks advice circle, I'm best ask. values shiny credentials them. But, words population health, risk, flattening curve-those mean NOTHING him. hears older unhealthy people risk (which fit image himself, even though 60s frankly healthy), that's irrelevant. really care infects someone else, that's problem. Many younger folks feel invincible nothing proven wrong, yet, true narcissists, nothing ever will.  also started reporting CDC. Hello improving numbers. abandoned solely due utterly mad response virus. issues going on, virus.

Makes sense. hard ignore this, changed lives basically every American past 6 months. But, it’s science respected... Yeaaaah. Aunt mom gen X pessimistic. Telling universal healthcare never happen, many things they're convinced never change even worth trying.

I told we're going end revolution hands things shape laughed. like???? learn anything Les Mis? history class? majority revolutions sparked poverty, lack access essential resources, oppressed, generally needs met. husband works labcorp. confirm true. r/nottheonion I’m *Literally* scientist. sarcasm. Please watch this. best 3:12 day I’m seeing models predicting that. best ones date us maxing around 1000 deaths rolling 7 day basis, means peak daily deaths consistently near 2000.

Edit: downvoting doesn’t change epidemiological models say. emotions don’t dictate best data science there. 40% still think earth 6,000 years old, shocking. advisors likely telling make announcement months finally understands may lose election. solely self preservation absolutely want making announcement. Hah really?!? Yes, w/ vaccine least use want eliminate risk. could (hopefully) around Thanksgiving. Charge attempted murder.  Well, again; shit? helpful chart. ""Excess deaths"" could people suffering chronic disease left untreated (diabetes, heart disease). looks like takes local jurisdictions municipalities (their hospitals M.E. police dept's) two three months accurately report deaths.

One month 142% additional deaths translates 3200 additional deaths per day. April. pandemic really causing lot deaths !! time deaths misadventure (deaths auto crashes, workplace accidents) must decreased. 200 BABIES Trumper lol can’t understand aren’t approaching imagination ingenuity. classes online. cannot (parents essential workers etc) attend classes conducted outside refurbished, high airflow spaces. Teachers willing teach outdoor spaces get hazard pay. temperature drops outdoor restaurants do... heaters. looking immigrating happened. wish would’ve taken plunge. Theoretically silicon handle high temperatures without damaged, find temperature set oven kill covid19, sterilise mask oven. (Without replaceable filter in). don’t know masks work practise, think they’re new solution. side always tries positive thinks we'll get true number post COVID analysis computer reporting systems date like unemployment system.Hiding deaths really short term thing think. Like COVID Flu however infectious diseases post flu season report higher confirmed flu deaths. lot focus COVID Flu it'lll lesser magnitude. click sidebar, Coronavirus sub 7 years old. Florida schools open less month. America always narcissist Nation, even way Trump.. I'm defending saying. always thought better every country, matters. virus making concentrated Deflect, deflect, deflect. deflect again.

It dumb works. worked past, astonishing, seems found formula audience plays well. hoarding wealth count? 
How lack compliance politicians? Thank you, missed it. wondering risk food prepared delivered someone positive. months responsible leader help US navigate crisis spent whole time head sand.

Basically. People would've rallied around personality broken anything wrong thing. People said UK, Italy Spain. possible requires competence  What? I’m responding entire thread purely political posts??? January, news China showed frantic medical professionals full PPE. keep ignoring causes death dropped precipitously also due isolations, car wrecks communicable illnesses. 

Even though car deaths huge numbers, overall deaths up. 

What causing pandemic?

And no, it’s suicides domestic violence, stayed surprisingly stable. right thing called bankruptcy. CCP supplied samples wanted world see, actually amazing think kind bullshitism gonna result anything. Don’t surprised Oxford vaccine harder time getting FDA approval versus ones stand make people rich beyond belief. Look im going say truth. united states poggers right now. Basicallly forcing us open economy forcing wveryone back work. Extra money government ends Saturday. Everyone forced apply jobs even still furloughed old jobs. leaders going saying masks bad masks good 4 months late that. lot us quarantining wearing masks public disinformation campaign united states insanely devastating progress cooked imo. I'm going move Puerto valarta whatever whenever honestly believe 9/11 would happened. alone changes everything better. Honestly, I’m impressed Cuomo handled this, found here. 

He’s put 145 page plan reopening schools, it’s still fluid. Looks like younger kids, older ones stay home.  daycare centers opened essential workers haven’t cases far.

If Govoners followed lead, places would already safely open. probably another 6 months spreading. put another10 states 2 week quarantine yesterday. don’t think “the US system” fault lmao. situation living 16 people reasonable. TF spitting 11 kids going strong British mate dont know f talking neither f anyone else. realise election December 2019... come im sure know this. Greatest Generation still kicking, still awesome. No. wait two weeks test result, result useless. Ha! Probably right. Nothing, it’s proving scarily accurate.

^well played Putin^ 5 months late! Better late never. Personally, I've always thought Trump bit dense candidate antichrist. cult-like following made apparent ripe someone sinister cunning rise power though. tell ""An employee tested positive need things. Also BTW Susan next two weeks.""

Public health measures trump HIPAA. I'll take bait, health!
I downvoted dangerous wrong. either Russian propaganda bot, Trump supporting human. Either way, good job fact checking anything Trump says. recall, Fauci said wear mask NATIONAL MASK SHORTAGE TRUMP 3 YEARS CORRECT, SOMEHOW STILL BLAMES OBAMA. Also, Trump could invoked Defense Production Act produce PPE, not.
Dr. Fauci scientist, make claims based facts. supreme dictator chief scientist, fucking country tiny, smalldick energy orange chode.
[Here, drink antidote Kool-Aid drinking.
EVERYONE 1/2 BRAIN PLEASE DOWNVOTE SHIT COMMENT!!! American Dream No. paid isolate, provided free hotel room since isolate home without exposing people. Ahh got ! I’ve got bad back. I’m slammin anyone, it’s gotta *really* worth it. I’d probably walk funny week afterwards, gimping around. sue police force, force settle lawsuit... Surprise surprise taxpayer money true. Here's thorough explanation mandatory quarantine punishable fines prison legal America  article there’s link Russia launch first vaccine late August. I’m gonna go ahead call bullshit. functioning brain.

So many others not.

Sad. know much source go onto dailymail website (disgusting know,) look hundreds people thousands upvotes comments get, echoing sentiment. Also Facebook rife mindset also. 

My comment dig right that's implying politicising comment. dig select right think everything ""leftist agenda."" know anybody seen anybody like I'm sure even British, plenty Wow. could pay visit Florida..... That's many room mates need afford rent California 🤣🤣🤣 always taking notes????

Perhaps trick avoid eye-contact?

They probably shoot whole village one infection there. :)

The hair style done way, make look like grandfather.

After all, claim grandfather, reincarnated. Hard get tested schedule appointment work hours Look good side. Florida gone, DC make even 50 states again. mean bought house 1600 sq ft less two years graduating college.

People Cali idiots. I’m pretty stellar northern city Vile creature. bad we're surrounded plague rats like her. nothing [plague rat taking side. Codral ads always irritated me, [this complaint even mentions social distancing pandemic response protocols dismissed. 

[Another complaint 2014 also one lot depth seemingly dismissed first one dismissed set precedent.

The recent complaint [was references inappropriate message ad sends pandemic, also dismissed alter marketing reflect soldiering isolation opposed ads.

I haven’t seen Codral ads time now, hopefully Johnson &amp; Johnson realises regardless winning cases message really poor one use times like these. would benefit running campaign right now. Finland Norway population 5.5 million. Sweden 10 million. shit Sherlock. church state supposedly thing

It thing US though. President pledges Bible, police pledges God, pledge allegiance references God. Also, many political discussions clearly religious, like abortion gay mariage. Even supreme court judges vocal religious beliefs chosen them.

The first amendment US constitution far ignored, especially people call upon acting like ass holes calling ""free speech"". $-value life comparing neighbouring Nordic countries lockdown? (Sweden: **5 646 deaths**, Denmark: 611 deaths, Finland: 328 deaths Norway 255 deaths) Yes, let's blame poor people living poverty. Bootstraps! Yeah, makes sense something evolves around good. Yes. sort infer issue saying something generic 'that employee currently home due personal health reasons', sensitive grey area we're encouraged avoid. really. government made mistakes doubt slowed spread increased testing. Right now, highest number tests per capita country population 10 million Robust social safety nets that. 

Best luck 25 million Americans risk eviction never understood reluctance. short sighted dumb. Even get re-elected, believe is, someone average intelligence would saw could scored votes earlier. followers would eaten spoon, could actually said whole time lying once. don’t give people money tools this, cannot, not. Poverty inequality affect us all, health relies everyone else’s health, relies economic freedom.

This America failing state. live seat crumbling empire, one lacks capacity even bare minimum solve global problems, warmonger. I’m Stowe Vt. one cancelled summer plans. lakes crowded ever been. traffic from, NY, Mass Ct elected officials United States admit it, everywhere else world seems recognize school risky rn.   He's forced recognize serious party's states getting hit he's finally getting heat people normally shield accountability. change tune aggressively ignorant base they've encouraged defy public health recommendations last 4 months? doubt it. chill sun long. Wife Filipina, hangs tons others, I've seen get super dark super fast sun. try purpose lot. Even mixed nephew, lighter, tans well. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣good one! Sure, 10s thousands though? ‘Murica someone paying stay home. Someone also paying people waiting test results stay home - come back positive. Someone also paying bars nightclubs stay closed, closed indoor dining closed outright. Drunk people follow rules.

This country fucked, kind like Soviet Union following Chernobyl... feel you. I'm UT 7 co workers covid refuse test rest us show symptoms. Even though directly exposed told tracers. Yet hear nothing business stays open. China nightmare country outside China stronger China. think best thing tell needs safe can't see you. Tell rules, listen respect you. I'm tired this. Coworker travels daily retail (essential) locations home office sick, working, knowing spent time two people tested positive actively ill. ""out sick"" 5 days.

Our employer's stance virus ""just bad cold"". masks, even employees retail locations (despite many complaints, one make them, so...). We've instructed sick let test us. contacted exposed, say working home since things originally shut down.

Anyway coworker back office again, still sickly. overheard cell phone arguing woman telling getting tested stay home. won't, though.

My employer going death me. wife exposed school turn isolate 14 days. see fuckers don’t wasted two weeks isolation nothing. Every time hit button 555 people die. British know fine well I'm referring to. Also, ardent Tory voters must surely pissed one man, democratically elected holds much power. lives 16 people?! said anything conservatism? said voting administration, party's false branding. GOP today nothing conservatism paying lip service.

Trump exemplifies perfectly - ran xenophobia, fear, ignorance, incompetence, greed, corruption, that's exactly entire administration levels. he's supported GOP 100%. 👏👏👏👏👏 I’ll take Oxford vaccine petty, ignorant, sad people turning pandemic dick measuring contest like absolutely everything. People dying throwing death numbers patriotic vigor. bad people. 

How location specific set challenges struggles go places citizens blame. places got infection early understood severity pandemic, places like US struggled political party spreading misinformation open borders 49 states. Seriously, grow children. tie long enough wipe ass front. yes can’t argue all, even want defend son there’s nothing defend. behavior ignorant dangerous me. Thank you, please stay safe like wish everybody [second part clear in-depth analysis three groups shows minor changes within sampled population Sweden country origin infection, compared import cases Italy Austria. indicates primary spread virus might driven travellers countries identified World Health Organisation (WHO) community spread early part outbreak, namely China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, Austria. ...hey guys, break laws whatever want massive societal scale. think this? problems solved!

You think smarter are, bud. Exactly, confirmed reinfections getting downvoted that’s FACT there’s confirmed Lol know history look kindly leper colonies. reports read regarding multiple ""covid hotels"" setup pretty bad.  Walmart's live allow us get car. load groceries sit car time ask slightly roll window request sign receipt you. Contactless payment only. cash exchanged customer signing anything. love it. issue period time everything shut took weeks grocery pickup forcing go store otherwise would have. work someone tests positive symptoms tested, sent home self quarantine work area immediately cleaned facilities. (HR) contact tracing investigation figure else may exposed, inform them, determine quarantined required there.

Meanwhile Friday idiot friends calling asking think ""the right time"" hang again. Totally touch. Read story different news website, apparently vaccine works 500k reserved. doesn’t make sense Pfizer Moderna final trial vaccine ??

Edit : got answer 
At least tennis danger infection partner. sweating, touching ball, presumably point might wipe sweat face could lead transmission. 

Honestly golf probably safest sport since never need even indirect contact anyone else. Yes, commonly used England rest UK Much higher I'm skeptical every poll nowadays, whether agree not.  they're scientifically conducted, might produce valid results. However, they're far, far easy fake one audit actual data.  They're easy way influence groupthink public. already probably around 40 million. catching 10% infections. bad news (more widespread think) also kind good news (less deadly thought, definitely around .5-1%, fewer severe infections thought initially). Wether common cold not, still weaker immune systems familiar amount widespread excess death going years due medical system collapse, you?

You cannot pat back wanting imprison others want right. definition communism.

The last two weeks seen marked increase daily deaths, even weekends. week lowest amount deaths one 29 June 5 July; worst day (30 June) 726 deaths, days 700 weekend 300 (save Monday, 378). following week, worst day (7 July) nearly 1,000 deaths (993), another day (9 July) 950 days 700, including two 800.

Republicans bitching liberal schools way longer 3 years. Nice strawman argument.

1. Nobody saying virus hoax
2. Nobody saying long term effects exist
3. everyone saying virus low mortality rate (statistically proven true) there's enough concrete evidence terms % long term effects recovering is, could 0.1% 0.0001%. know yet. 16 people house? vehemently argue electoral college. already lopsided representation senate, presidential race well?

The argument cheap tests done home everyone find people stage really producing lots virus (and infectious people), rather accurate test done less frequently takes long time test results. Check reading skills. He's saying there's going decline happens slow painful even so, wearing mask outside sunny breezy day.. lot different shoulder shoulder hundred people crowded indoor bar unfiltered recirculating air. one thing big pharm never accused of, wasting money. bullshit covid vaccine work still make billions, like flu vaccines produced every year work   chicken wings substituted boneless chicken breast me...and specifically said substitution item. Almost situation me. work different hospitals everyday trying extra careful. felt like shit 3 days row called doctor wanted tested. Reported work said stay till got negative test 14 days past first symptoms. took 5 days get actual test (drive thru oral swab). took 13 days get negative results back. wait longer delayed test results positive quarantined.

I wish positive. hate working hospitals. walks line False negatives/positives thing awhile. time prepare. There’s excuse. Newsom started strong caved open-up crowd paying Crickets fucking virtuous closing barn door horse escaped, really. 

The time wearing mask height it--when people weren't. 

You people still aren't: different RI current NY/NJ/CT compact restrictions kind travel within United States. understand support motivation. question legality internal ""border"" controls. 

I Mystic CT RI restrictions place. Local reporting roadblocks turned back NY license plates - racial bias really apply decision-making strictly basis objective factors like license plates. Karen Karmendia Karnson Newsflash:

COVID directly attacking rearranging heart itself. think blood clots adequately explain range [cardiac found recovered patients study. mean WHITE christian MAN. DGAF middle part true can't say ones loud.  see value large proportion population uses them, people actually take action based results. 

If 80% population using test that's 70% accurate, catching 56% cases chance infect anyone. That's pretty big gain. 

But 10% population uses it, catching 7% cases, probably less useful. Especially since small minority people using would probably people mostly staying home abiding health recommendations anyway. 

And people know inaccurate ignore positive result also symptoms, ignore symptoms negative result, that's also pretty bad. Yeah agree sentiment potentially heightened self responsibility available “information age”. poignant relevant data required create healthy sane life available amazing way hasn’t always so. point trying make, probably poorly, data existing accessible isn’t necessarily enough. also lucky educated enough desire capacity utilize available information meaningful way That's freedom baby!

A false negative empirically worse. may spread go hospital ""it must flu"" ...  remove elderly Norway Finland’s casualties make fair again.

Oh wait, it’s back ~5x.

No one protected elderly. simply cannot isolated entire segment population. CDC director Robert Redford Ned Stark warned us, ""Winter coming"" exactly, potentially able spread symptoms, (if among estimated 60% EVER symptoms). fact 40% infected know someone tells they've exposed happen get tested (or able get tested - without symptoms that's difficult now), fact spread days symptoms, assume everyone infected. Throw new complication even people think might can't tested timely manner again, doubly so. bring back live, knowing it, tell anyone, pretty scary.

  states, calling HR say X disease need time (or whatever) covered anything. 

People blithely assume info employer knows, even they’re HE, going leak. USA still leader number pandemic cases.

Americans might learn feel like every nation, friend foe, will. Conspiracy theorists keep imagining virus came secret lab weapon. imagine future case attack(s) highly successful half Americans say hoax, half refuse convenient easy thing stop it.

It's like entire nation dying people think seatbelts driving sober impinge ""freedom"" double drink vodka driving opposite lane swerving anyone seatbelt on. family member Canada got tested results 8 hours.

lol, love y’all downvoting repeating medical consensus that’s article. Keep fightin good fight, guess.  Welp, simple effective bet ass Trump ain't gonna it. Shame. Scotland 0.3%. surprised given long took testing really get ramped UK, guess infection levels dropped low need much testing more. Almost 20% mind blowing. Yes issue. Less 50% Americans net tax payers. government isn’t efficiently spending money get.

I cut government check $10k 60k salary last week. It’s choice children make choice spouse ones footing bill.

Remind me! 3 months answer question. 

If ran store completely naked questions apply. store let shop naked avoid confrontation? lot ""punish people right thing"" going on.

I even see people nominally side (i.e., think virus real wants beat it), get angry someone get infected. want blame person it. way know infected told us. good thing telling us! 

We *want* people tested. many actions punish testing.

We *want* people report positive. many actions punish reporting. would go Disney? I'm kid kids. care politics, trump good move stop anti mask movement side. Take W gang.

Curious far know medical files always confidential knows, covid may change things. bright side didn’t you’re still living.

USA, trusting us honor system ain't gonna work. like miracle heard. secured $20 per dose, means pay around $1,000 dose insurance $10,000 dont lol. finally seeing going get re-elected work heaven disagree every point short term 

It abhorrent allow children go hungry. addition, hungry children well school, making likely need assistance long run people would wise up

There's evidence Divorce would go down

People hate one another staying married good thing. People staying abusive relationships good single parenting would reduced

Very people *want* single parents, even It’s unsustainable now

Only refuse raise taxes--in particular wealthy. I'll take dose then, thanks new law, signed Brown Oct. 6 takes effect January 1, changes misdemeanor, carrying 6-month prison term — punishment knowingly exposing someone communicable diseases.

This quote article. misdemeanor crime? vaccine determines everything point Why? SAR government solely responsible handling outbreaks Hong Kong. would uproar Beijing took control handling it. Although might end asking help, there's rumours it, locals definitely keen. misread it. authors updated methodology. read paper, said 728 excess deaths March 15th May 15th, ages 20-44, 51 deaths confirmed COVID. send literally around 100 studies articles PCR tests pal. research. beyond well known documented unreliable PCR tests are. Meanwhile Sweden, pandemic already over. Feels good man.

Have fun that, rest world. lol They’ll employers tell fuck right think either continue stay home come unvaccinated.

Or children barred school don’t proper vaccine  go back read comment say people take vaccine period. said verify safety vaccine make rational decision.

And safe vaccine public safety. talking hundreds millions people taking this. forced taking potentially unsafe vaccine time proper clinical trials studies verify effective safe. 

My concern Pfizer long list abuses put profit safety even causes numerous deaths. government dangling huge sum money front vaccine, personally bet take shortcuts cherry pick test results favor make sure lose contract. 

Blindly trusting corporation shown clear lack regard human life seem smart. potential impact huge number people, much important close oversight vaccine ensure fact safe. I'm sorry :( hope things improve soon. remember thinking going bad US current administration coupled peculiarities American culture (which leads large amount people universal healthcare f. ex., imagine also masks?).

It must lot worse even official numbers suggests Trump finally come said wear masks regardless much people may dislike it... upvote: urine denial. Science real time, guess. Sucks living that’s sure. Jesus, positivity rate high FUCK. remember lot concern Michigan's testing capacity showing 10% positive. come ones talking 100 million vaccines coming December?

EDIT: oh Neither plague learned live Bullshit, control cases already there. Honestly I’m expert I’m open different views whole thing. China indeed boosting defense budget now, well unfortunately. wasn’t superior force US, lot countries around world would pretty fucked. think we’d see much aggressive China Russia, they’re already aggressive is. I’m 8 months pregnant pretty terrified. Mostly people taking seriously Disney, course!! That's way growing me, grew military, base grouped housing rank essentially, basically everyone living around place life, ages, kids age wives work, everyone watched everyone. sustainable?

The problem kept living 16 people 1420 square foot home tell them. need make quarantine facilities available, people need move them. Acknowledging good modern capitalism offers absolve criticism. Capitalism US deeply flawed. also worth mentioning capitalism see Germany, even UK, much different form modern capitalism see US. crazy bit? Americans don’t realise universal health care doesn’t men big tax. example, top 5% earners U.K. pay 15% tax. CDC says increases chances experiencing severe symptoms idk we've kept bars gyms closed state, still seeing rising numbers... maybe like florida, texas, cali, Arizona....although say I'm work 2 inpatients hospital hold 60 patients.... Yeah, definitely knew you’d bring “barely deadly” piece shit. think you’ve already seen plateau. There’s enough people wearing masks realizing gravity stopped exponential rise phase. isn’t enough people that, enough political wherewithal really fix problems think you’ll see long plateau churns southern states. Even I’m wrong still growing instead maintaining, don’t think you’ll see testing maxed out. Deaths interesting watch. southern US maybe South Africa two massive outbreaks think people weren’t blindsided (meaning testing showed massive growth cases well tsunami deaths hospitalizations arrived) think lean lot disease misadventure Must feed fresh flesh... become zombies I'm sorry, wrong/misleading. may directly contract someone home, person infecting infected outside home. Therefore, indirect contact point (point origin) outside home. everyone household isolated, virus going magically appear infect household. 🎶Sweet home Alabama, virus true...🎶 POC already living fear lives. Businesses legal responsibility comply health regulations. agree fault business owner closing shop can't. expect regular retail worker risk lives. However, store **doesn't** enforce mask mandate risking lives, too. Everyone's lives. People dying disease way stop people comply regulations. 

To use another example, clubs bouncers common theme environment draws angry, drunk, violent, belligerent customers. safe regular staff handle that. That's specialized position needed. That's unfortunately something clubs factor overhead costs. club handle common situations customers generate stay open. new normal might something grocery stores do, too. 

Another solution might store owner monitor customers wear masks and, rather confront them, report authorities. Watch security cameras report credit card info license plate car drive in. responsibility Law Enforcement handle there. need issue citations system place ensure people comply laws. business owner can't say ""let's avoid conflict letting anti-masky people whatever want.""  real evidence variant infectous apart lower pcr cycle thresholds study controlling initial viral inoculation dose. far remember. I'd love this, problem trust parents know. ""Suggestions Guidelines"" instead enforceable orders leave awful lot personal interpretation. exponential growth starting kick numbers become devastatingly high quickly on.

The combination lagging indicators coupled exponential growth making boom/bust cycles public perception. goes like this:

- People start getting sick, close things down.
- People continue get sick 2 weeks, die 4 weeks. People take quarantine seriously period.
- Numbers begin go down. People tired inside, see think worst over. start going outside.
- **DANGER HERE** People going out, numbers going down. start making poor decisions like wearing masks, social distancing, going enclosed spaces lots people, etc.
- People understand pandemic spread warn need stop, numbers still going down, listen.
- Numbers start going back 2-3 weeks. People continue go out.
- Numbers SHOOT reflection last 3-4 weeks longer quarantining. ok nobody dying (yet). ""More people getting sick, people dying much. new strain? getting better treatment?""
- 2 weeks later deaths FINALLY start catching (that's today).
- Things control. solution total quarantine again.

So that's stand. People awful understanding lagging indicators exponential growth work. number cases currently hurtling upward, deaths starting go reflection, yet we're still talking opening schools year. Crazy. wonder Trump wants CDC picture Lower working memory /= lower intelligence. common symptom people adhd, many quite intelligent.  compare test results countries? tests accurate normal coronavirus tests? really, no, although may present person. cause-effect relationship shown two, although correlation. Yes, whole ""Keep calm carry on"" memes British WWII propoganda. Stiff upper lip that. America “Ask country – ask country,”. ingrain expendable behest economy. Even population viewed livestock, still maintain health livestock. priorities skewed.  Absolutely write software free; I'm big believer GNU free code foundations. also write software primarily profit. house. write software make free done. 

We need middle ground profit allow now, pharmacy companies tweak coating pill (my exaggeration) re-up patent 19 years, shit stop. I'm moderate liberal, im ignorant movement hold big pharma accountable. describing fantasyland.   arrested legal? way exponential growth goes...uh... get negativity guys, he's positive person! someone work feed family, selfish. Chinese flu barely deadly. worth forcing someone poverty.

Screw retarded strawman amd false dichotomy. intellectually dishonest know it. coronavirus HIV. LMAO much taking seriously implementing effective measures. lower moderate / severe depressionrate indicate country better mental well beeing start with. guess dont fit narative. interesting also misleading, obviously virus still originating outside home.  Maybe think I'm I'm advocating herd immunity...?? I'm not.

I saying everything Sweden wrong. great scientists doctors like neighbors.  

Most people got things wrong. Maybe people need stop throwing stones storm over. want really parse happened, that's gonna long time now.  math assumes covid must kill two people produce orphan. 13 million single-parent households US time 0.01% case fatality rate implies 1300 orphans. also consider many children raised grandparents elderly caregivers. model wrong.

But think downvotes coming mainly defined ""orphan"" literal-minded way seems callously ignore vulnerable people society might devastated loss caregiver even loss not, technically legally, make ""orphan."" Yes do, March semester went full-online, honestly didn’t think bad. Sure it’s degree education normal in-person teaching, still job  hope I'm wrong I'm expecting thing explode schools open. Indoors, many people close proximity, prolonged exposure = perfect place spread. research recently this. think heard hidden brain similar podcast. predicting fell conservative liberal. 

The idea conservatives friendly person(people actually know) care less strangers 'liberal' minded people less friendly person cared strangers well (as principle). 

Please take huge grain salt recollection could wrong Well theory, US Medicaid supposed people employed make certain amount.

But absolute garbage, millions people receive health insurance employer, yet qualify Medicaid. people fucked (Obamacare set ""marketplace"" them, premiums much much higher equivalent plans paying group rate).

Obamacare *also* included Medicaid expansion would help fill gap expand Medicaid coverage people mentioned above. course, several Republican Governors refused expansion state part bill black man Muslim-sounding name came with. fact, still 13 states refused take money—that already allocated state, essentially free money expand healthcare poor folks — despite proving *very* successful every state accepted (including several initially turned later accepted seeing work, looking Rand Paul Mitch McConnell Kentucky). hand... black guy weird-sounding name.

I believe hospitals also required treat life-threatening issues anyone, whether insurance not; they're allowed turn people away. end paying anyway, funded increased premiums rather tax businesses wealthy.

So arguments hear people universal health care country. tell Medicaid (it's trash, there's significant number people fall gap they're eligible). 

They also tell ""everyone gets treated anyway, like hospitals turn people away."" This, course, incredibly disingenuous. one, person insurance going treated *very* differently someone ""Cadillac plan"" (as call it). imagine likely studies regarding differences health outcomes hospitals people insurance without.

Another issue argument, thing mentioned above... Yes, health insurance get car accident something, treated. like treatment magically cost anything. Someone still pay it, ends rolled constantly-increasing premiums people pay insurance.

So already hodgepodge form ""universal"" care, everyone cant technically get care, could done inefficiently tried.

Those people health insurance.... can't go GP feel ill. Urgent Care clinic. don't. That's public health issue. even bother mentioning preventative care lol. things get bad enough decide need care, go? Emergency Room.

So increasing premiums policy-holders across board (essentially tax, completely opaque controlled multi-billion dollar business, rather government *supposed to* serve people) cannot refused treatment treatment free, also clogging ERs issues taken General Practitioner. mention fact that, able go GP regular basis, preventative health would cause burden system go down...

It's clusterfuck, *stupid* clusterfuck clearly manipulated decades lobbying special interests bloated, horrific beast. People US see awful government (often design...starve beast) handling health insurance current form, think means handle (true) form universal care. realize reason awful — aside conservatives try sabotage — we're working incredibly broken system.

We end paying much higher amount per capita (and that's per capita, includes people without insurance, Medicare/Medicaid. obviously, going people policies, meaning pay even more) civizlized nation, health outcomes good/better enough warrant shocking amount money spend compared nations universal coverage great quality care.

Sorry, lol, rant. grinds gears... prepared idiot American conservative tries argue health care. research first, course, verify things I'm saying. 1918 flu, one member house goes wild public full idiots accidentally brings home share rest family :( ELi5: test determine longer this? test much virus system? Obviously someone recovered ""the virus"" system someone never got first place. test distinguish two? Yeah, said doesnt want anymore testing wants slow down. Like make go away.

Wait... supposed read headline? many PhDs have!? /s 1. Testing sucked start pandemic. know true numbers either way, seems likely we're getting better finding asymptomatic mild cases.
2. We're testing different people; younger people getting sick (whether they're ones getting exposed time around, we're restricting testing worst cases).

There going another spike relatively untouched states. Would rather start production find correct candidate, losing half year scale production up? 

The whole point can't really use money accelerate process, except pre-producing vaccines. I'd wait data reconciliation. true would atleast make news India. reconciled data today come tommorow 11am (that's govt realised figures everyday). yeah worrying true. death rate still pretty low many cases though (1.3 million). pull Donald Trump; stop testing virus magically goes away totally normal capacity, though. ICUs commonly operate ""close"" (relatively speaking) 100% capacity, fact surprised learn.

you that, people.

they own, even want show it, even hide well. 

Bolsonaro Trump list ""Top ten people never want wake 'Freaky Friday' type situation"". Kind surprised mask wearing willingness increases people age. impression social media gives anti-mask crowd bit older, seems opposite. Also, RIP Millennial generation we've apparently devoured Gen Z. LOL exactly supposed avoid infecting people household? retail worker, confirm careless customers zero respect maintaining distance store employees. customer product want, squeeze within inches get product. drives nuts inconsiderate people shopping. poor etiquette, I've people literally reach head I'm stocking lower shelf get item want. God forbid politely ask space trying job least say excuse way. Over-entitled elderly people take kindly reprimanded public. Agree. Especially since people believe money influence politics. believe many politicians believe COVID dangerous would rather let businesses hurt. That’s reason believe many want schools running again, many industries tied sending little Skyler Amy back school.  Colleges can't even summer break without outbreaks actually discussed NPR bro fair don’t think we’ve grown numb it, government doesn’t want address it. 

The economy important. Let’s move forward. newest neighborhood advertised affordable housing built, started selling lots recently. “New single family homes starting low 1.1 millions!” Really? happened affordable?? Let's look 3M. greatly increased number N95s produce. also selling around world... abundant supplies PPE us. said it’s also target meet goal increasing global production N95 respirators 1 billion annually 2 billion 2020’s respirator production plants China, Singapore, Europe Latin America, well Aberdeen, S.D., Valley, Neb. Masks generally made market #for demand surging COVID-19, 3M also shipping millions respirators made China bolster U.S. production, 3M June completed #a new N95 mask production line Wisconsin factory# primarily manufactures equipment make respirators.

If notice, 3M added single manufacturing line one factory according Bloomberg add line much start idled one.

The idea businesses going built American soil happening. true enough PPE enough chemical stock expand testing. 

It's infuriating, straight capitalism motivated patriotism even self-preservation there's national level interest solving problems beyond writing checks. worst part self-quarantining surge. make kids hug love right time may going catch virus die. know again, another outbreak might quit work. Numbers misleading. People die coronavirus die Influenza, overall death rate big. surprised yearly world deaths Influenza dropped average 500k something like 200k 100k. Bolsonaro done like Japan, quarantine vulnerable get it. lol yes.
http://inproportion2.talkigy.com/nordic_comparison_4jul.html lucky work company like that. Congrats! Looking back media coverage Wuhan, American attitude seems “can’t happen don’t eat bats government won’t cover coronavirus.”

Well, wonder Chinese media portraying American response. “Silly Americans. don’t listen scientists. government doesn’t care citizens.” Judge's emotions to, fact immediately proceeding arrest shit eating grin face kind cancels lame apology defense attorney usually opts for. Showing remorse usually leads deeper end punishments. 

Also think Judge's emotions play sentencing try flipping lol....contempt court literally offending Judge punishable jail time. 

Also I've watched plenty footage protests, not. I've seen several protests person too, wearing masks.

I literally never said reopening lead increases, full shit think protests didnt effect it. motherfuckers need stop defending bad behavior codemn others.

COVID CARE POLITICS JUSTICE.

I look footage? one ignoring video evidence.   said, Georgia, half population Florida, arguably worse far deaths go. Another 81 today. That's great news, schools still go back person Monday State.  protesters wear masks

Go look video footage BLM protest. *protests,* *lootings.* Tell us see.  #if? Well dude it’s better homeless. woman probably couldn’t afford take sick day got everyone sick. others telling you, good parts worth it. like lifechanging good, least IMHO.

Even though different datasets there, generally excepted John Hopkins reliable point comes numbers worldwide. outside US.

Not proper governance. Consumer spending major driver countries economies. I've seen assault deadly weapon, attempted murder. biggest rush overlapping phase 1 2 trials. pretty okay drugs based existing vaccine platforms.

For phase 3, primary endpoint efficacy could fairly low (50%) least another form protection. 

Long term safety course question. again, vaccine based existing platforms adjuvants, liklihood harm goes quite bit. Vaccines also dosed twice, body's reaction occurs early, opposed long term therapy ultimately cause liver failure example.

You'll still year's worth data people able get dose, quite mitigating factors. high hopes fast track still sufficient. That’s even wrote. Stop trying victim. doesn’t know yet, test positive tests you’ll find.

he needs stop testing himself. way end positive outcomes.   informative study right along side one study said water wet. apologize sounding negative, lack common sense could prevent much sickness death astonishes me! Ahhh ok. Good hear. one comments stoop level bring basic understanding stealing energy intensive r&amp;d research political implications entire world bad, random person Internet, worth it.

I'm surprised type behaviors reported live Japan saw reports woman went back forth two cities buses informed infected even BBQ friends infected too. I'm ready snap make cop shoot surprising country people dying can't afford pay obscene cost insulin! /s

[In past five years, price insulin US nearly doubled. Diabetics medical coverage insurance pay around $1000 every month life-saving drug. Many resort rationing insulin intake, sometimes tragic consequences… - “Dear daughter, happy shared 22 years life. sad time come end soon. needles, stressing health.” - 
 Antroinette Worsham’s eyes fill tears reads tribute wrote daughter. - Antavia died two years ago. Type 1 diabetic depended daily doses insulin live. could longer afford pay life-saving hormone aged juvenile medical assistance programme 21. - - Antavia working two jobs pay limited insurance enough cover cost insulin crucial supplies, like test strips. paying $1,200 $1,300 dollars 90-day supply insulin. times got insulin sister Antanique, also Type 1 diabetes, times grandfather. finally, start dangerous practice rationing. - Antavia died April 26, 2017, diabetic ketoacidosis. That's bingo Welcome reddit love you. exactly what'll happen. Everything point lack leadership overall lack compassion quickly forgotten somehow it'll end everyone else's fault. Man, glad live shithole cou- mean, US. Right working. Honestly, glad see less face. talks thing mouth looks like go guy. constantly looks like either finished giving head one death cult.  so? European countries less people US states higher death rate. Where's supposed go? can't trust anyone. joke. jail this. think Florida government seems hell-bent literally nothing stop it. Nope, none **GODDAMN FLORIDA REPUBLICA-**...

...wait. France less people California Texas combined. 

yet France deaths states combined. That's competent all. I’ve never heard 4 unrelated families I’ve known people grew living like extended family. wife’s grandfather lived really big plot land built small house parents, another daughter got married, two people forget. one point 20+ people living lot, split 5 households, good amount space ‘yard’ area none separated fences anything. die you’ve got young kids. strangers it’d bit weird. 16 counts aggravated assault He's losing badly right now. made political took, wrong side, demonic side. recommendations killed 10s thousands. damage done already. People wearing masks probably continue it. Good God. We're never going get control things we're worried about. really point one take care weeks? Facebook That’s social security for... backwards dystopian country risk people's health going work sick.


Meanwhile, companies pay salary first 7 sick days... produce doctor's note pay 7 more. still sick, government starts paying 80% salary instead.  ***She didn’t say*** end year. You’re interpreting every statement pessimistic way even interpretations incorrect. good stuff. Yeah, hopefully DOE able help convince push back person date. I’ve heard rumors he’s going make announcement week regarding remote learnin, we’ll see it’s already Thursday. Wishing oldest! Bullshit. France, Italy, Spain really, really shutdown.

Dont countries much higher per capita death rate US? They’ve also World Cup landed moon. trying get across skin color needs irrelevant. Everyone seems obsessed skin color realize race, human race. Treat everyone respect show shouldn't. judge people color skin, judge content character actions. can't one thinks good idea. Nice. American her.  There’s swath people without paid time off, mostly service industries (from understand) causes problem acting like you’re positive. yes. seems like attempted murder charges need filed, dozen charges least. accountability optherwise never totally get rid virus, slow enough. 

I feel person, really do. fact living roommates kids could either imply economic religious reasons. Sticking economic reasons, must felt like go work instead staying home.

But told roommates? Imo that's selfish part. going work bit, could understand that, telling others live free choice whether would like temporarily move, stay find way keep safe you. kids probably it.

Oh, imagine school. Diseases often spread around yards campuses parents sometimes send kids school sick without saying word. kid would either spend whole day coughing sneezing around students, catch whatever had, get caught point sent nurse. common occurence mom (she's teacher family) students sick, parent working answer phone. kid, could walk talk, sent back yard campus spread diseases. 
Sometimes, parents get her/the nurse's face called work come pick sick child.
So imagine schools open right now, area would 9 - 11 kids attending form daycare education would form carrier. Spreading disease teachers, faculty, staff, peers. Subsequently peers' families, etc. 
Again, shit never slow down

This disease showing terrible consequences America destroying safety nets kept citizens afloat tough times. nothing fixed this, go back old way life, assure outcome worse. also forget cleaning necessaries (toilet paper, shampoo, soap, cleaner, ect) need bought advance. people fresh food? Medicine? pet food? (not pet food stay fresh weeks) people rely stores buy clean water? Power outage food goes bad? people use public laundry machines? People can’t canned food salt? people can’t processed food ingredients (most long term lasting items processed)? People use insurance company covers specific amount medicine once? 
your delusional think would good idea.  could keep open don’t lose job like millions people Thanks putting jingle back head.

Earlier people lived single house central courtyard 4 different doors led too. time turned 3 whole houses. people. many days everyone might dinner together hence cook together kids run houses hours eat wherever please. aunts grandmas always feed anyhow. people even dress every day?

Have seen people walmart? think pajamas perfectly acceptable street attire days.  r/boneappletea Often people mistake silence agreement.  usually possible simply say ""I think fake"" without launching argument. I'm sorry 😐. ""Flawed"" use tangible data formulating educated guess?

I'm ""worried skin color."" care. I'm filling blanks within mind.

If happened Germany... automatically assume person accused would German? people states Texas California combined France. 

yet combined less deaths.  16.....Must Mexican. matter attract scouts. I'm mostly staying home enjoying BBQ pool. go feel like wear mask. would nice dies down, ultimately affect much.  one paying $2200/mo studio Atascadero. Sorry source, read elsewhere couldn’t find article.

Lol Many people country suffering illness called Denialism*, yes, real mental illness. Normally condition effect people, unfortunately sick people plague.

*In psychology human behavior, denialism person's choice deny reality way avoid psychologically uncomfortable truth. Denialism essentially irrational action withholds validation historical experience event, person refuses accept empirically verifiable reality. Ok Yeah Kroger near even enforce mask policy, shit gonna happen.  Make mistake, people handling food sick. getting sicker every day, cannot afford miss two weeks work, go sick. CEOs companies already made peace work force dying, work force like abused spouse cannot see way this. even cloth masks significantly worthwhile preventing spread I’d imagine air filters HVAC system well Cally Amsterdam expensive city (though rent-wise is). Otherwise agree I've heard amount time exposed factor. indoors long periods time people highest risk. grocery store mostly briefly passing people takes 20ish minutes.  people keep going work can’t afford to, others employers try coerce keep going work, bought misinformation don’t think it’s big deal, idiots. sort attitude country 140K+ dead, people simply didn’t need die. vast majority deaths 100% avoidable. Typical self-centered American attitude I’m going want damn consequences behavior affects anyone else around me. sort attitude slap face medical personnel fighting effects virus. many Americans apathetic selfish attitude. wonder we’re getting fucked virus millions people think like missing detail death counts/reports greatly lagged - people often die weeks ventilator takes weeks certify death/cause, hence death count seeing 14 days ago month ago - backfill deaths way beaten. Everyone wear protection and/or stay away everyone else (lockdown). cannot trust infected contain it, that's reality. Everyone must assume everyone including infected, take measures catch it, try transmit it. Happy Cake Day Let's get mad woman reason it.

I'd rather employees possible contaminate it. Lol vaccine 

SARS-CoV-2 latent intracellular pathogen elicits NF-kB driven immune response. NF-kB multiple functions, principal function control pathogens establish long term latency inside cells. Specific viruses bacteria evolved enter cells specific receptors. NF-kB immune response attempts thwart decreasing expression receptors, decreasing sensitivity, creating blocking antibodies receptors.

These cells therefore become hypofunctional. diseases, particularly psychiatric diseases, also thyroid disease, cells may become hyperfunctional order compensate hypofunction. Thus blocking antibodies attach thyroid stimulating hormone receptor thyroid cells prevent real imaginary infection, cells shut production thyroid hormones. compensate, stimulating antibodies attach TSR receptors cells cause produce more. compensation mechanism become excessive, resulting disease due much hormone produced.

The principle applies psychiatric disorders characterized positive negative syndromes, bipolar disorder schizophrenia, order maintain neurotransmitter signalling homeostasis. cellular hypofuntion predominant, depression bipolar disorder, negative syndrome schizophrenia main symptoms. compensation factor excessive, mania positive symptoms schizophrenia main symptoms. risk go concert... nice.  remind people housing situations always showed Soviet Communist Russia movies black white movies 1940s 1960s? Like 3 families children living apartment? make sense, showing symptoms, regardless diagnosis, stayed home go work. Almost every state mandated employee allowed without reprocussions. Yes, lawmakers always perplexed throwing money problems work. Falls category thing expecting different results. feel like would trouble things anyway. wearing mask somehow made relevant subreddit, sounds like typical psych case used see EMT Super religious immigrants would surprised discover tests never run. 48 hours every test returned negative. 

*Waves US flag.* Hey Arizona checking here. Don’t come. Unless want covid. fucked one cares. **Florida:** 17 July, 23,170 cases, **246 hospitalizations, 4 deaths** 10 - 17 age group. see numbers Florida Dept Health website.

**New York City** death rate 0-17 age group = **63 deaths** high-risk indoors
low risk outdoors distancing masks. Population density matters aswell, texas+california lot bigger france. need ""use lose it"" law housing, least ""use pay more"".

And multiple properties want responsibility landlord, maybe could government program allows government rent private properties people need housing reimburse property owners accordingly.

Governments every level need held accountable housing well. Far many municipal governments willing say ""yes"" big business wants open corporate office city question asked whether enough housing accommodate new workers, government tells big business, ""oh, commute next town over"".

That work. want work, want business, want income, accommodate coming who'll making money you. buy call everyone lefties believing virus bad 

This absolute minority view UK. polling data clear lockdown overwhelming majority people took seriously fully supportive measures control virus. fact lockdown success new cases are, least now, way low manageable level shows people took seriously unlike US. polling data continues show substantial support reintroducing measures necessary. fact I've literally heard single person UK calling people 'lefties' taking virus seriously. I'm sure done I've seen evidence, either data personal experience widespread view. 

This stretched, partial truths (at best) representative situation UK. commenting become political UK, politicising it. You’re going serious problem getting either countries unless specialised, demand skills Oh yes Nordic model, reason think model works?

Because actual democracies give people fuck votes. guy Finland (Juha Sipilä. interested, I'm sure google name) messed unemployment benefits years ago. like that, next election told him, democratically, GTFO.

One first things new people vote got rid Sipilä's idiotic rules.

That's works. fuck would 16 people living household? California fucking weird.  true. make wrong. one way get control quickly.

It would 100% cause rioting. Every wall every grocery store would gaping holes it. Every window would broken. would week 3.

Good kind generous people children feed would looting house week 5. owner probably would want sell renovate, usually zoning restrictions prevent it.

Homeowners always going vote changes lower price home, like high density residential zoning. :( system perfect one gaunteed wait better one get afford it. Sides... thought Canada private public system. can't afford Canada definitely affording Ya, I'd really like know too. I'd like finish year Ireland that's going need long airplane ride.

Surely anti vax tards shut mouths... everyone forget already fed confiscated PPEs hospitals unknown reason? problem is, WILLINGLY 11 kids, already stupid selfish, regardless financial status poor makes worse. That's willingly.  Yes? family bunch random people strung together evolution, chance like many enough want live completely entangled like this, pretty implausible. Heh. grandma 15th 16 children. far rare cebtury ago, I'm from. I'm saying crazy, really shit period woman, certainly *could* possible. Doug Jones already going lose seat. barely edged moronic pedophile, constituency conservative. Yeah sound like perfect encapsulation approach medicine. Yeah, seriously. Pump brakes, kid. Well, kid’s college classes online (despite promises initially person instruction). 

Will interesting see Halloween looks like year also. It’s favorite holiday can’t really get excited trick treating year. see point, 11 children tho? poor, kids least responsible thing really. They're expensive need time care boost. HCQ becoming snake-oil failing administrations. Yup. said said. controversial opinion multiple children, time educate herself, learn trade, etc provide children job benefits pay appropriate needs.

People put situation get sick miss work they'll starve. time even pay issue spending issue. Americans especially live wildly beyond means. 

If children... would done one children got seriously sick (not even covid), left kid home hoped okay work? Would still considered selfish stupid one kids dies left home sick take time off? Ohio. Got tested 7/7, got results yesterday 7/21 case 90+% would antibodies numerous studies coronaviruses shown. 2k deaths day back first began? remembering things incorrectly? That's something driving insane. ""If bar til 10pm, 2am🤔🤔"", ""If stay drink get food, cant stay drink""

Because chilling bar right fucking dumb fuck! concessions live country fucking babies can't go without bars months. 

And dont give shit trying keep businesses afloat supporting shit closest bar getting takeout like week there. order, wear mask I'm there, leave tip even though came pick up. Plenty opportunity support favorite establishments safely, people selfish want want right now. People like her..., last part pretty much entire topic JFK’s Profiles Courage book.

In case need quarantine reading. Agreed. must also prepare generation less educated citizens unfortunately, online ""learning"" effective.

Not like there's alternative unfortunately, online classes never replace person experience long run Fed controls monetary policy. It’s Congress would need take action, know, GOP-controlled senate isn’t going willing help people like enough. 16 people household? member Brady Bunch last four years, yes. Seriously, sometimes glad China went ""maximum 1 2 kids"" rule cause people fucking like never evolved. unfortunately stuck religious households. Everyone probably go travelling situation going even worse. honestly can’t understand people selfish. Like, seriously why? tf lives 16 people? Sounds awful *The study done May 25 June 5 followed 198 people Daegu city never tested COVID-19, found 15 them, 7.6%, antibodies.* 

*That much higher infection rate found survey 3,000 people South Korea excluded Daegu, one person showed neutralising antibodies novel coronavirus earlier month.* 

***Health authorities urged caution study, considering small specimen size use rapid antibody test kits 92% specificity****.* Scum. still really testing? saying US government would've done fine governed Norway? 16 people household da fuck? Vote third party then. people break mindset, nothing change. fucking started yet, little slap &amp; tickle. Waves continue next year, hot spots flattened, open back early another wave. lucky.

For real though, honestly loss words here. flat fuck confused you’re coming from. point, Florida's cases simply limited Well shit. ""For study, researchers surveyed 755 individuals Poland...""

""Our study conducted one culture – affluent, stable European society, seriously affected coronavirus,” Zemojtel-Piotrowska said. “We know exactly people dark personalities tend buy supplies – greedy competitive others take care personal comfort due feelings entitlement.”

Greedy, entitled people continue act greedy entitled unreliable study wealthy area Poland Coronavirus. speechless. God Allah thing. god, different word it. 

Is common, people think Muslims Jews worship different gods? people going private gatherings, dont forget bc they're ones spreading COVID19 fastest funny thing watch group them. hate other, compete sell river heartbeat! thing CDC never came guidelines wear masks correctly. seen people reuse disposable masks like glasses gloves. state government: No, useless corrupt too

The mayor: something, much deep shit want defie decision lockdown (we one) quick reckless reopening. 

We every week day thousand cases state, like today 772 new cases. That's still lot yet one government cares, literally. want state university open soon, lifted ban intermunicipal boat riding etc. say stable: FUCKING AREN,T Culture US biggest hurdle.

NYC, vast majority people use public transit, there's lot housing overcrowding, simply come contact people daily life. Yet got control people stay home, shutting schools indoor businesses, requiring masks public. things worked elsewhere.

The problem America simply people (and government, elected people, so...) Well yh, would give shit random meatsacks they'll never recognise. Might aswell numbers seeing bunch doctors NYC passing thru spending fee years abroad. MASSIVE disappointment. fact kills every time Even said would limit company cost... exactly good means check reasonably true... mean executive compensation important part company cost...  good thing they've working hard get virus control virus avoided.


Oh wait haven't? Omg Yes. election votes currency. best earn much possible. states higher value (higher number electoral votes smaller, less diverse, populations) states maintain (party affiliation). everyone grand unified message like coronavirus created, best repeat everybody else wanted.  different approach logic would be, selfish care mostly health, therefore wear mask protect yourself? Yikes. Please vote  fuck still open??  2000,000-400,000 died Unit 731 40,000-300,000 nakking massacre. 140,000 lot don’t forgot, US helped rebuild japan war, let emperor stay even committed war crimes atomic bomb ended world war.

...is imagine went down. know every time someone mocks Trump countdown recovery resets? It’s definitely worse Iran Brazil. countries mass deaths don’t testing diagnostic capacity track it. I’m sure researchers try go back gauge it. US still horribly terrible “world leader” there’s absolutely excuse badly botched this, many many countries far deaths have. worst part people personally know died ones played safe.

I'm sure know couple churches carrying usual quick little Reddit comment, wish use broad brush.

EDIT: Whew, soured. exactly surprising. sure feels good get rare opportunity rebut real-life corona-disseminating pastor. sure commenters come back here's clarification. it'll help, give picture actually going on

1. met online quite while. hold two services limited &lt;1/3 capacity. Limited service times greatly. require masks. Registration required people seated 6+ feet apart. reevaluate regularly. likely go back online soon. community transmission stay communication area government.

2. suggested meet money, still giving entirely online. financial incentive meet person.

3. I'm able recall statistical anecdotal significance large-scale transmission churches *with similar meeting protocols.* seems careful church services contributed little grand scheme matter. mean impossible, fear every week.

4. know approach popular sub, followed actual guidance received, local, state, federal levels, understand, risk causing outbreak low. 

All say - original point quite fair state churches generally wishing whole process away. might disagree choices, but, instance, taken whole thing seriously. overcounting undercounting way get good picture look graph excess deaths year compared previous 5 years. find highly entertaining shove hypocrisy right face disgusting, venomous ""pro-life"" shitbags.

Unfortunately, care. satisfying ashamed embarrassed hypocrisy. understand keep paying people research things everyone already knows. spend money help research vaccines something?  Lab Corp fucking joke. 6+ months still cant handle basic lab work. Sounds like getting paid handle tests. Tests still highly un accurate.

I trip planned September. planning trip since last year. going best trip life. 

I cancelled, obviously. still sad it. depression worse it, depression even worse state world right now. desperately wish everything could normal, isn’t right now. 

The people going Disney world claiming “depression” lying. selfish, know they’re doing. denial try use Disney cover up. Like Disney fault. endangering communities, cast members choice, everyone around making idiotic decision go theme park Florida’s cases surging 10,000’s. It’s absolute selfishness. It’s seeing beyond scope. 

I wish could go Disney. I’d anything go Disney World right now. would never kid absolutely right thing right now. right endanger others “fun”. “cure” depression. Disney wait. that’s people don’t seem understand. Disney still stand over. Screw short lines. go back crowded parks pandemic done, it. must USD. It’s 1 Million CAD 3 years imprisonment based paperwork provided Canadian Border Patrol Officers. recently returned Canada US Quarantine. (1-5% mortality rate - rather conservative here)

That might untreated fatality rate. proper treatment, fatality rate might low 0.3-0.5%. 

On hand, it'll tough keep proper treatment scenario whole country gets it. Douchebag can't give immunity facilities run like this.

""We can't give companies immunity. us might shareholders. risky."" - Half congress probably NBA lab, too. That's problem, supplies needed. Everybody needs supplies. NBA testing daily heard delays yet. Actually, NY *far* tests per capita CA. I’m sure real cases thing.

The harsher truth people hate see others struggling instead wanting help....they give fuck hiding it. People readily ""believe"" false narrative supports pre-determined team. unless bad PR enough investors start voting board members recently didn’t get job they’re hiring ""-Deaths Corina virus-."" somehow sounds like tried say corona china virus time. Didn’t also say figure likely guidelines followed, hence worst case   ""Hey, survived [Black bad be?"" necessarily. study came saying household transmission rate around 30%. probably higher studio. dad it, mom never got - granted two three bedroom condo, room stay apart/ use common sense heard shit mom. think population density California. comparison I'm guessing bad Florida honestly know. I’m conservative many friends family. never heard read claim “so much country” believes. source even said built Area C, Israeli side. 

I support two state solution, like majority world. Israeli Palestinian propaganda called out. It’s impossible situation. didn’t think that. Friends across border tell people getting overconfident.

Also Babis lot corrupt stunts, trying use pandemic laws benefit cronies. led people taking problem less seriously.

I still confident react right way numbers rise again, though.  Plateauing 100k cases per day leads hope? Oh guys.. Yeah .04% whole world would 3,120,000 dead.. shit ton. direct deaths. People forget indirect deaths.. 

One thing worries going happen Pandemic knowing healthcare US going use either tested Covid 19 Covid 19 tool reject future surgeries. addition, stupid fees going added.

Oh yes Nordic model, reason think model works?

I give anything charitable organizations take money admin costs, however donated time helped within local community (volunteer work) Morons! Invisible Pink Unicorn obviously one true monster. I’m sadly going lol They're literally explaining states reports deaths. helpful people know. people probably see 90 deaths state today might think 90 people died COVID yesterday today. reporting complicated. American terrible complicated way reporting deaths. two exclusive. Suicides? Complications delayed health procedures screenings? Overdoses? think nobody would notice that? America! god-given right hijack whatever want! Exactly. True narcissistic personalities look number 1 ALWAYS. Publicly may talk dumb masks etc secretly wearing one. Laughs Canadian. got flu work kids January covid March. Covid felt like absolute hell compared flu. awful seeing infant daughter fight too. Thankfully son husband bad.  ""it's mah constitutional right!"" cult say now, cult leader asked wear masks? cases caught border. last case community transmission 80 days ago. Make mistake, China sat hands LONG time starting finally try control spread virus.

EDIT: surprised CCP shills hanging Corona sub. guys earning CCP wages, that's sure! Depends density given location terms spread. 

Much whether hotel conference center. They're place go piss cup see smoked weed month ago. We're 1000 day again. So, no. That's problem. problem thing kills people. sure missed but... Hey, welcome party. also helps politicians puppeteers give shit. Capitalism pure evil. 

The entire world working vaccine cooperation. go know whether survival irresponsibility, communist EU countries would sent home sick leave, work cleared. Coronavirus showing nothing exceptional American exceptionalism. Among 11 children woman's family? low dude. heck visiting actual hospital medium risk? Fair point necessarily countering point original topic. Rather pointing false security people seem partners ""having tell first"". people informed better.

Someone correct I'm tired look dont think federal law regarding intent spread infectious diseases (and constitutes intent). HIV spread physically never precedent something viral Supreme Court law. least far know, dont proclaim expert this.  People think geography social dynamics suburban rural America completely different dense urban center like NYC *they are.* 

It's obviously much easier virus spread NYC, obvious solutions applied sparsely populated areas people social distance easier.

I left east coast headed middle America pandemic precisely much easier distance maintaining normal life here. need stores shut there's curbside pickup drive throughs one using public transit walking/gathering close public spaces.

Trying impose NYC solutions heartland 'rubes' make sense people resent, contempt urbanites. cover people extreme ends? People refusing wear masks people holed bunkers 10 years food toilet paper. Yeah, really agree one. hotels open, donut bars, whatever open, intent fill get people spending get tax revenue, keep jobs. model making stuff available blaming people utilise them, seems bit off. 

It hotel bar open (relatively) safe, local legislators nutters. consumer judge.

Now, live area rules seem led science, something needs closing advised follow it, open utilise it. Seems pretty reasonable strategy me. track every nuance COVID propagation (well actually do.. normal) rules place venues operate ensure level safety, I've seen broken yet happens (but I'm Europe, mileage may vary)

Opening bars instance blaming 'kids' going strikes utterly wrong headed. venues open empty? can't both? mean, combat ready 2016 budget. really go every year? Clearly, would save lives investing healthcare. love word skeptical used here, instead ignorant, naive, stupid. convinced somehow considered evidence. That's wipe lysol. lot people ages pre-existing health conditions make likely die corona. People late middle age like 50s 60s likely die permanent health issues it, too. shouldn’t sacrifice lives govt cheap committed old ways capitalism winner takes right thing, is: pay everyone stay home another lockdown, give essential workers hazard pay, implement contact tracing/testing/isolation program. doesn’t matter much costs US government enough money this. It’s fair tell everyone pre existing health condition isn’t young anymore ‘oh sorry you’re acceptable sacrifice, need get lives.’ flexibility like changing way distribute resources emergency serious. False! true narcissistic personality going risk either getting sick looking physically bad flaunting rules looked smart people / others. I'm minimalist wear masks? mean always summer maybe, even that's pushing it. certainly time. Source, live often '50s winter.

I've 15yrs never lived house AC.

Edit, words added. agree whole heartily , charities scam Bear mind also committed multiple crimes office, Presidency thing protecting going jail.

He's deathly afraid going jail, he'll anything get reelected. people around - Republican Party whole - largely anything help him, lot likely go him. Failure prove non-existence can't criteria belief. can't prove non-existence Zeus, Leprechauns, flying Zebras crazy supernatural thing imagined. 

But sign intelligence hold back belief anything can't documented would contradict physical laws reality understand them. Someone troll trump get think numbers would improve endorses looney tunes thing typical R&amp;D. literally companies airbus hospitals operate. That's optimistic Bound rise atleast lil since stage 3 hit ontario numbers gone slightly. People still go absolutely necessary. Theres need destroy 4 months sacrifices start over.

Traffic basically back way used toronto. That's comparison per capita.

But fine, compare LA (10 mil) NYC exact number people matters you.  Yes does.

It's 3-painful-week-with-mask-on total social distancing. life back. encourage domestic tourism save local tourism industry.

Hope pandemic end soon countries well. asshole, I’m guessing grandparents (and many Trump’s ex-supporters) abandoned side affected policies inactions. 

Not said Mexicans rapists. separated families border put kids cages. impeached. nothing bounties Russians troops. hundreds times could abandoned say something awful.  
It took something like pandemic near danger illness maybe even death FINALLY realize maybe Donald J. Trump isn’t best leader get us crisis, crisis matter.

If you’re new voter, suggest follow many diverse new sources information possible. Fox News, CNN, Washington Post/Times, New York Post/Times, Atlantic, Angeles Time, HuffPost, Buzzfeed News, Breitbart News, etc.

Read stuff sources see they’re pushing. News distorted news, news commentary opinion.  
Knowing biases source news something many fail remember remember that. 

Be informed vote time can. Check state’s voting site make sure you’re registered. Try vote mail it’s available.   
Welcome participant instead observer. deep web wonderful place get controlled meds drugs sensible prices. Don’t forget March! Part reason stop shaming people it. It’s gonna magically go away course .. Oh definitely mean anyone whining wearing mask ""not grown"". comparing using term men stated previous poster.

I understand wanting reality. is. dont want reality lupus, pregnant pandemic. are. Whining helps one. presser forgot March  testing tourists? risk spread again?

Edit: found Vietnam banned entry foreign nationals since March 22 exceptions conditions, including 14-day quarantining arrival. Since March 25, international flights suspended, except special cases like repatriation flights.

Most tourists local then? People learn loved ones die late... believe move, attempt file state would living in. would apply Illinois similar pandemic unemployment fund exists there. worst happens get denied. Good luck move!  looks like child forced read apology letter front class. think ""problem"" lot people's take away dealing ""restrictions bad"" rather ""our government failing us"" .

I say someone going myself. We're fucked... mad lack preexisting safety nets, they're trying put place stop transmission. considered honestly idea abused hurt innocent people. makes less problematic 30 years now? deadly then? immunizations longer active then? anti masker try argue really selfish one wanted everyone else wear masks didn’t get sick. shitbag employer probably got PPP loan [Vox good story UN approved Israel join UN, said would allow Palestinians right return. finally recognized, stepped back promise never even tried make displaced Palestinians whole. good way start relationship, right?  Could steal something put mask? Like tasty pastry, yummy cake. (not actual medical advice. Random person talking. Listen doctor, me): Wear mask stay opposite ends studio. Keep windows open able allow air flow. need try fulfill 30% household transmission rate. Yeah data seems pretty sechy well. Even don’t count deaths people can’t get access medical care becouse staff shortages, still way low. Like originally NY peak US mortally rate 18% multiple states similar situations mortality rates dropped 7%. buying it. much hate say there’s way mortality rates low.

Edit: mortality rate mean cronoviris everything. Yeah definitely believe you. Wrong, specifically advised healthy people wear masks. days: ""I've always said wear face masks. Look, back January said, thing, huge way, thing really going get control. nobody listened me! Even doctors like Dr. Fauci saying need masks. Look now! I've always said it, always said. mean look, doctors wear masks get sick. Never get sick! everybody wear mask!""

-Trump, near future, probably. Ah No, think they've earned year's Darwin Award... Someone going call posting everywhere, think MATH+ currently best treatment protocol hospitalised cases want people know see applied hospitals around world:  

Developed Dr Paul Marik, Chief Pulmonary Critical Care Medicine Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, VA. Hospital ward case fatality rate 6.1%, compared least 24% according cohort studies around world.

The protocol uses Methylprednolosone **not** Dexamethosone according Dr Marik wrong steroid. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) deoxidizes glucocorticoid receptor, making Methylprednolosone effective, well powerful antioxidant ROS. Enoxaparin (Heparin) treats hypercoagulable state.

[Here excellent interview Dr Marik goes detail protocol Shiiiiiiet. Stay strong wear masks guys. Best luck.  choose latter. sounds style, mask front! real problem replacing masks every 30 minutes. cause harm good.  F'ck NO! Maybe decoy. USofA really land Freedom® think, act stupid There's crucial difference businesses going under: actually using thing ears. Well done!

So keep care mask. Store box (so get destroyed), leave fresh air using dries mold, case need use mask frequently think buying second even third one rotate much higher chance get rid traces virus without use chemicals (which might destroy mask). favorite Yes it’s leaders.

That's evolutionary pressure works - viruses kill hosts - incapacitate them, even make look weird.. spread easily. tend die out, rather retreat reservoir. viruses side, likely become less deadly.

There's also immunity - eventually develop consistent immunities things consistently exposed to, unless they're mild enough kill us. constant game one-upping viruses potential hosts, new strains emerge - regular genetic drift recombination - covid 19 recombinant, ""novel"", beat us badly... 

Then there's medical science. Early claims vaccine within year probably wildly optimistic, covid-19 continues major problem coming years likely develop vaccine three, well effective antiviral drugs treat already infected, well effective prove protocols treatment.

But tellingly, know happen happened like First thousand times. u wanna see happens vaccinated people get contact virus need place still infections going on.

If u u never know vaccine effective. Hmm. Interesting... work, hospital, loves consider working hospital LOW RISK, since wear masks. I've recently tested positive covid, well 2 coworkers, convinced work say otherwise. Going work riskiest thing grocery shop. mask policy much patient visitors love take they're patient rooms, defeating part purpose. Em-bare-fucking-assing-assing! Want guess demographics? little misleading, 500 active clusters, \~90 \~50 investigation. 

the R 1.2 largely infection rates hot spot departments main-land territories - infection rates high see circulates.

&amp;#x200B;

that said, vacation up.. may different story. course parents rich.

Normal people give away 100k rich people? US needed increase testing month ago tbf. think mostly gave number twice two different claims used ""like"" first time. title probably misleading ways. misleading state something fact, rather quote, source adequate certain claim true. would still controversial inadequately sourced claim even used word ""roughly"". reasoning appears faulty cites sources. even said ""roughly 95%"", would misleading state proven fact, transcript live radio interview studies cited reliable source paraphrasing claims facts. think largely article misleading though. think would better delete basis reliable source rather flagging misleading title. extreme bias news sources irks greatly well, prefer reading international news American topics (am American myself). Even though news sources bound bias well, help see things outsider perspective since nearly great motive often information sources lack. favourite country get American news definitely Australia lol. They're like younger sibling calling every stupid thing slightly older kid does. likely mom, sister aunt 16 people living house. Eyeroll.

Competent countries dealing ""spikes"" 30 cases many cases can't even hope contact trace even fraction them. running needed March option pack 48.. 

2 mid 20’s men, still 16 familar fact millions illegal aliens living California? totally right want cast everyone large families awful people. Growing neighboring family lots foster kids, least 8 time. traditional family, family great people best help many could. I'm bad mood week relations, found youngest cousin trying run away live dad would great her, incredibly messed feels need so. step moms dream basically that. little families together one area, homes. I’d fine it. living house though? thanks, share crowded living. work. Probably Tcell SARS-CoV-2-specific cell immunity cases COVID-19 SARS, uninfected Democrat. thought guys figured think logic around immunity incorrect many articles papers. know antibodies makes immune need antibodies immune. new studies people SARS back early years 2000. still T-cells likely immune SARS. Defenders: but-but , US pays R&amp;D costs etc etc It’s binary choice charging cost vs price gouging. They’re private, for-profit companies - making reasonable profit isn’t unfair incentivises research.

There’s different discussion pays drugs - US healthcare system different most, even single-payer system still pay drug companies. individualist ""me first"" culture work.

We're taught young age look ourselves. 

We shame adult children living parents ""making it"" soon enough.

We worship money people. 

Changing president going fix this.

The entire country needs cultural reboot. either violence chaos. Sums anti-maskers perfectly, tbh. logic science position, idiocy checked, literally piss rather grow up. Fellow Med tech here, confirm. currently antibody testing Abbott instruments running reagents don’t get full shipments. also ordered instrument perform swab tests since March barely getting week. guess what? swabs reagents needed actually run SARS-CoV-2 tests back ordered October. Hrm... I'm going say least million Americans. Maybe 2m. Americans desperately want prove part group stupid moron humans! California Blue Roy Orbison quite literally textbook example handle pandemic. elected leaders ignored smeared public health experts, argued dismissed (or outright misled) facts mask usage spread, decreased funding testing, even threatened defund schools didn’t open. opposite things would listen experts scientific community, promote encourage mask usage, make test funding priority, blackmail schools opening/keep school buildings closed. Behold, you’re way properly handling global pandemic.
Seriously, America Facebook incarnate, place rampant conspiracy theories misinformation, try demonstrate fact fiction you’ve got bunch Karens Chads popping anti-mask flash mob protests.
*cries American* Source “they sat hands months”?  

Specifically months part. Haha, try isolate kids. They’ll bang door try get hands tear open get like bunch zombies pick noses lick doorknobs. 1 hour later seen without public. knowingly infecting someone illness crime

I doubt much. could abused nth degree. took two extra clicks get actual source data: believe actually **more deaths** official number

31% believe actually **less deaths** official number

31% believe official number right

And surprise, divides pretty sharply political lines. 

When comparing survey 2+ months ago, Democrats become mildly less skeptical official number, Republicans become significantly skeptical official number I'm 27 I've flu twice life times legitimately thought going die. fucking terrible. Translation: ""I actually hard data! Hmm, do? know! I'll rude person asking question, perhaps one notice nothing!""

Why would expect data long-term consequences COVID? even reached long term yet - virus months.

Yes, noticing people recovered serious COVID still symptoms couple months later.  promising, prove anything rest lives. #Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

About time eh? Smh Really? many new illegal settlements Israel built since Oslo? many farms villages destroyed? initially reported May 12, Cheney tweeted: ""Dr. Fauci one finest public servants ever had. partisan. interest saving lives. need expertise judgment defeat virus. Americans thanking him. Every day.""

I couldn’t said better myself. immediate problem lot people ""our government failing us"" ""the restrictions fucking us"".

It takes bit detachment abstract far enough get ""the government what's fucking us, restrictions fucking us"".

Also like million times easier stop restrictions fix many varied issues government. *cries Texas* phenomenon called ""Superposition waves"" /s Sure called Kung-flu recent rally.

The Chinese connotation isn’t offensive s\ Roy ??  Land desperate really. think one shares living space 16 people work devastating illness there's another choice? positive come I'm gonna save like $8k food, transportation, housing staying home rather go college dorm fall semester. now. that's like saying ""my state's golf score way lower New York's, yay us"" played 6 holes. Still many go  rarely allow supply drop 50 rolls even normal times. would ever that? necessity, buy anyway, space. likely decrease price future. recoup loss stocking need buy less use supply, ever want that. there's ever shortage, I'm covered (turns was, although seriously expect one) 50 entire time.

I 78 rolls package makes intriguing dubious claims ""mega"" status equivalency four rolls each.

Downvote preparedness mentality want. better emulate it, though ♥️ little late imo, damage already done.  basically grew way. Old family farm, lots parceled uncles build (my aunt mom get land fucky, aunt managed buy original house property). spent years babysat aunt, running wild shared properties cousins. took test July 16 still don’t results. It’s essentially useless point. bet sample took isn’t even good point. Minneapolis Seattle  doable. back half classes, masks need worn outside social group class bus. Half class week. Half remote learning. Also social distancing rules.
Contrary expections student compliance high soon parents got message non-compliance tolerated could lead expulsion school.

We cases popping schools, local healthcare offices brought control quarantines TTI. Sometimes closing school 2 weeks. Sometimes quarantining classes home. runaway outbreaks date.

State govt still saying want get full normal September, informal channels say govt change mind due new incoming evidence Israel RoK.  Yes, fully agree. simple ""just go"" people facing homelessness, lack healthcare, complete loss income. Teachers US work long hours shockingly low wages treated like garbage.

The safety nets US stretched beyond breaking point. Many going lose homes eviction freeze ends month, tensions high tons unemployed people plain getting unemployment checks. explanation given; money promised simply never arriving. Many skipping rent keep food table right now. 

You seem opinion magically ""work out"" teachers quit, ZERO resources fall back on. work, eat. can't pay bills. can't afford see doctor. mass walk-out really much every one quits there's dozens lining take place, plus administration trying gut public schools years favor private religious education. give two craps public school teachers quit, weakening system they've actively working destroy.

This quickly turning Great Depression 2.0. look things certain angle, maybe there's problem covid all.

That angle ""head completely ass"" cunt happened Houston they’d point democratic mayor, elected republican judges left, Judge deciding everything young woman color use excuse. Things would ended exact across country. One side (or least 1/3rd) country hates science facts. 


Houston tried fucking hard. mask mandate stay home orders early NYC went shit Abbott went Judge Hidalgo’s head said couldn’t fucked everything up. Fuck Greg Abbott. deaths Texas. Pentagon want quick treatment prevention. somebody prepare war something?

Edit: saw USA kicked chinese diplomats (houston). Fuck. 5 adults 11 kids. Probably two couples 4 5 kids 1 2? I'm assuming. common roommates California live family. first mad read honestly understand why. Rent super expensive blame her. sad us live paycheck paycheck can't afford sick live debt. already fucked health system person charge making things worst. feels impossible make right choices bearly any. hope generation fix type situation never happens.  brother works red cross dealing logistics nightmare them. Previously evacuate people shelter people lost homes could temporarily packing gym school church. virus spread population like wild fire. way avoid spread people reduces capacity shelters significantly causing whole bunch new problems needing create even shelters. Im sure talking photo, taken back 2017 bunch pyramid scheme con-artists arrested.   Remember Diamond Saw Cutting Robots? Americans want enter Wuhan without segregation? killed people Wuhan come in.... Even closed travel China joke

The Chinese government already restricted citizens traveling even shut airports.

Trump joke. Nah. selfishness republican party put country position.

""Doesn't matter till happens me."" Peeing ground new ""your taking rights away"" anti maskers . words, pee. anybody saying"" yeah kill me"" probably really right, kill however mean seriously fuck up.

We idea long term effects Covid-19 are.

It could massively increase chances getting cancer example.. 16!? 

What piece shit, throw jail RIP Michael Reeves Pokimane.

You dearly missed. already

No can't CA cases mostly new takes long time die it.   bill matter producing vaccine profit? President Chump see, different opinions usage masks.

I call mask part ppe, ppe stnds ""personal protection equipment"" ""community protection equipment"".

&amp;#x200B;

And yes, feel confident virus needs transported way. P3 masks block transmission via air surfaces whole set different mixtures deal little friend, plus one way gloves.

So running around 20 years hostile environment lab, forced use ppe regular base sure know use gear.  dont see 65k daily cases deaths  believe “it news” refers Intel revealed November news April.

Evotec wins Covid order Pentagon

The Hamburg-based drug researcher Evotec develop produce antibodies lung disease Covid-19 USA. Evotec subsidiary - Evotec Biologics received corresponding order US Department Defense, Pentagon, worth $ 18.2 million (€ 15.9 million), company listed MDax announced Moregn .

The monoclonal antibodies used treatment prevention disease. aim provide Ministry Defense monoclonal antibodies quickly efficiently. Evotec share gains Tradegate trading platform. US president, also half country supports him. Trump exception, he's example.  Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* cousins boss knew kept going work . slipped mentioned fact needless say that's alienate workfore 

The craziest part type job could done remotely problem fine obey quarantine. Take three weeks work, self-isolate hotel two weeks, surviving delivery food, week vacation.

Or, know, stay home. site? Knock knock.... there?  Covid... covid who? Covid became endemic! imagine many unconfirmed cases going get worse hit maximum testing capacity idea true number be. 'would have', never 'would of'.

Rejoice, blessed CouldWouldShouldBot! Also:

3.) lot cases clustered immigrant communities/suburbs often language barrier restricts communication. Encouraging people test positive warn people community (family, friends, local businesses, etc they've contact with) likely much effective random outsiders come try figure everyone connected. Australia too, since beginning. number top universities dependent Chinese international students.   It’s flu every year. It’s different strains. He’s abysmal polls moment Look China haters saying wont trust news coming Italy. point Americans always hate China Chinese regardless virus origin. Screw say. Stupid point. Many countries handled well don’t deserve derision. countries handled poorly, absolutely deserve blame, many people selfish stupid. Poor responses terrible situation don’t give free pass China ROOT bad situation. 

You talk blatant disregard safety? documented evidence China actively suppressed problem tried silence whistleblowers. think lockdown response good, world bad, doesn’t mean China absolved wrong doing. don’t advocate formally penalizing sanctioning China, say nothing wrong response mess wasn’t good enough asinine. 

Here metaphor. fire started woods campground, campground ignored got control. fire spread neighboring cities failed evacuate, mobilize fire departments, etc. cities would bear blame managing fires clearly heading them, would “the whole reason city flames”. Mishandling bad situation absolve people responsible bad situation. 

Again, think responses show China difficult situation dint think punished, say fuck countries responded country fumbled ball first deeply insulting, especially many countries got responses right essentially COVID free.

As addendum, don’t like anyone calling Chinese flu, don’t think it’s necessary beneficial say fuck China, think hard penalties won’t necessarily solve anything, wanting give blame giving blanket blame countries deal consequences failure truly idiotic. Look posts /r/ketorecipes plus subs wiki benefits free though. French rioting gone long way ensure decent standards living. welfare state reforms come population demands them. 

The US considers socialism ridicule European countries. country worships billionaires. dug grave. Coronavirus shit getting real separate outdoor concerts.

Protests masks found risk, kind activity without spike certainly outdoor concert.. IMHO, antipsychotics widely diluted water paranoids almost psychotics thoughts time high, fascinating scary.   females

wait Instructions unclear. Infected whole household . He's trying best back peddle shitty lies behavior base practically gone now. people left voter base Karens. anyone surprised people act like this? Turns integrity, lacking it, actually matter. everything right... think UN objective infested feel Israel thorn ass past 73 years. tiny jewish state build amazing legacy science, agriculture, medicine help create device probably typing hateful crap on. Good luck keep close tabs success. Hopefully lose much sleep it. mean “being American”. themselves. much hospital bed space taking, time medical care providers could go people deliberately arrogantly put harm's way.
Idiots. work title 1 school. large percent kids live poverty. live grandparents. coached middle schooler couch surfing year. coached high school, drove every game practice. 

We supply food kids every Friday make sure eat weekend. 

Our district fed kids every week since got March. 

I one kids younger. 

My school provided computers hot spots every child need. 

Apparently district didn’t take care needed failed you. That’s good all, it’s still silly bother look religions fairy tales destined future myths mentally weak use crutch cope meaningless reality since can’t deal greater purpose. 🤷‍♀️ Must finally listened briefing knows COVID wave 2 going much worse.  swear going book title next years. 16 people living one house 😬 lady dumb that’s entirely many people. Yes no. It’s realizes shit hit fan covid wants able say “I told masks effective.” hoping he’d able play anti mask thing elections he’s facing tough reality longer invisible gaslighting. look like legitimate study. survey.

Two soldiers showed symptoms first. went vacation last month, one also off-installation travel earlier month, officials Gangseo-gu daycare center cluster, 3 family members patients diagnosed COVID-19. case local transmission reported Gwangju. woman 30s ( Gwangju Patient #191 ) infected Gwangju Patient #172, contacted patient cafe, belongs badminton group cluster, subcluster Gwangju door-to-door sales office cluster.

All remaining cases reported Seoul metropolitan first, that's still greater % revenue example lol

Second, that's fraud committed. That's fines paid getting caught it. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* He's crossed bridge years ago. promise make America great turning everything America used stand against. Yep, got rabies vaccine felt super sick couple days after. Seems potentially worse church mask wearing impossible eating. Everyone entering NM required quarantine 14 days. exceptions rules tourists want bit tubing. called 'mandatory' reason. may legal consequences disobeying rules. workmates smart people. Keep away people smart. I'm quite following, miss? anyone underlying medical condition obesity. know someone works there... can't train people overnight job. bad shitty place work.  I’ve never scared right now. 

What world say briefing scare Cabinet material charged Guess I'm ⅓, compare average deaths previous years see we've suddenly got LOT usual, counted Covid Covid related...

Yeah, numbers definitely way lower true death count. fact they're intentionally fucking stats look bad making things worse.

And Trump putting mask, he's briefed something that's scared shit and/or he's realized poll numbers fucked. give shit people health. Fucking Karen... wonder small caskets cheaper? 25% years election years! read comment another sub. want scientific study proving get coronavirus gym wear mask work out. Better deaths. Land free, home brave, ....and stupid, apparently. Also say: similar feeling. body clearly fought initial exposure long hard. Tested positive. Cold symptoms ~2 weeks. final sigh relief feeling 100% again.

But couple weeks later got “here comes cold” sore throat feeling progressed course day. time woke next morning feeling right back 100%. 

Note: initial infection, partner became sick progressed symptoms week behind me. So, I’m assuming germs definitely still floating around apartment. Also, here’s “it’s scientific” disclaimer well. happen celebrate Christmas? washable handkerchiefs? say things like want conversation. want say piece without contestation. tey really want talk word law without challenged explain anything. Do/did symptoms?

If long, get blood test somewhere check antibodies? favorite story tell lately first time read Stand. know plot was, decided take vacation Las Vegas. I'm reading plane hotel room get jave TV on. H1N1 thing, look see VP Biden saying want family go busses airplanes.

That bit mind fuck. VP saying avoid airplanes crowded areas, im Las Vegas well known sober uncrowded places. YET STILL TRYING NORMALIZE CALLING ""CHINA VIRUS"" come BLM protests apparently immune spreading virus LOL I'd like see comparisons countries. Based personal experience* expect Russia pretty high percentage believers. I'll bet countries really outliers.

*(With believers, ghosts)  2/3 adult women U.S. obese. 

3/4 adult men U.S. obese. 

Willingly giving heart disease U.S. I.Q. 69 ok. 

But wearing mask .004 death rate flu narcissistic?? 

Idiocracy average American. Would crime?  That's argument all. He's saying people already died March, people would scared taken seriously. We'd preventing deaths August later bring. Instead get number small background deaths point 1k day feels routine, August see many deaths. 

It's like people rush put wildfires imminent threat, dont worry small fire late. mean even early July would better. reason cares poor polling. New York's wave hit early, cases SEVERELY undercounted due lack testing start this. There's way compare total cases cases per capita state NY that. There's sections NYC hit hard near herd immunity levels antibodies population.

Even though NY near top pack per capita testing, timing hit higher per capita testing versus actually massive peak infections (total infections, ones caught) makes data complete mess. Wall Street big businesses probably crunched numbers $1.7b math hard ya? Entirely, cut trip short self quarantined home. Massachusetts, tested numerous times work 6-8 days norm, kind surprised hasn’t improved months happened several months 150k dead people ago. Could saved them.

Instead convinced dumbass supporters coronavirus, convinced corona dangerous, made ""cool"" wear mask (among supporters is), defunded people actually give shit, fired pandemic response team Obama set situations *just like this*. Why? like Obama.

It year 4 narcissistic asshole office, still believing support assume narcissistic asshole. idiot. Probably earn waiter US professional latin american country, least healthcare system. vaccine, treatment. way people downplaying get admitting wrong. two week quarantine would apply everything I've Unless missed it, still federal mandate. also said, last week, there's time &amp; place wear mask &amp; still thought individual choice, &amp; states, him. reading speech &amp; really surprised go rogue &amp; blather freedom choose. think many base ignore video, due past words &amp; actions &amp; say forced read it, stick previous line choice whether wear mask. It’s likely Trump prohibit import vaccine, buy one less effective costs 5,600 per dose, thee doses needed. tied together terrible way.

Disgusting lack leadership. Hospitalizstions spike Oh totally don’t doubt he’s sad. I’m sad miss friends activities. youngest kiddo looks yearbook watery eyes good week. understand (and explain him) important. It’s weird time world sacrifices much better made. Plus, I’ve never seen gaf feelings much pandemic. Giant chains always right employees. choose to. flat earthers aka deniers now? Hardly hoax it. Soylent Green. I'm going vote him. I've proud vote last time way, little 14 days since 4th July?! saw coming...

Edit: according reddit experts memorial day deaths. Haha good point! losers catch viruses!! Glad they're starting wake smell BS. man never given platform spout lies abuse. Same. got pushed back 2 weeks still going back. Aww, look getting defensive. fact openly state feel self-confident random person internet forum merely highlights insecure *you* are. I've mentioned before, projection posts staggering. 

If really felt need prove anything me, bothered multiple responses made comments. would ignored gone life.

This!! matter respond bad guy. try debate calmly, smug. get emotional response, asshole. refuse get it, pouting. always get quick covid test leaving. Well official number probably wrong.

Right, I’ve wondering too. aren’t seeing headlines linking community spread specific flights airline workers. They’re stricter environments, altho it’s enclosed, air cycled quite bit. mean, pandemic. feel like Americans arms up, confused, trying argue they're water near people. Completely trying step ignore international law Canada's serious tone serious issue. 

Its like American gaslighting/distractionary technique engrained minds culturally something. 

International waters go home, fellow Americans. True. someone dies home, get tested. ""wAiT nOV iT'lL oVeR!?!?!"" 

It's bad FL. FL many people fucking clueless think giant conspiracy help get Trump out. Excessive pneumonia, stroke, heart attack related deaths up, actual Covid-19 reported people still think Covid-19 deaths reported. 

The thing see(on news) guy died motorcycle accident counted Covid-19 death. know we're going wait autopsy see Covid-19 caused accident (heart attack/w/e) killed straight listed like people keep saying. Regardless there's way overly counting everyone, excess deaths certain categories linked Covid-19 added Covid-19 death toll. Oh absolutely know people didn’t take seriously it’s *infuriating.* cares Ivanka making look good (in mind) count? supporters start wearing masks number cases start coming take credit. claim great leadership brought virus control. conveniently forget delay acting cost thousands lives. can’t wait next week, take public bus public train job server indoor restaurant that’s open summer mask enforcement. /s Oh hate stories healthcare worker gets sick worse, dies. Condolences family. Yeah. understand frustration stay home parent already spend LOT time kids. quarantine home time kind suck little. Especially can't even take many fun places used order burn steam. midday matinees theater trips museum. endless walks bike rides. pretty limited spring summer.

My older one delays really benefits therapies receiving school, younger one used get lot one one time older brother class share attention time 3 year old (and second child) always share me. Sometimes tell misses girls time used weekday afternoons. son misses classmates teachers. miss break fights toys every 15 minutes day long.

She still naps used least solid 1-2hrs day eat hot meal, clean house, fold laundry without interruptions, maybe even something nice like put full face makeup, etc...and that's gone since March. 

I cleaning kids bed can't immediately undo hard work, eats adult time husband. I've gotten used constantly interrupted sharing meals never able go bathroom peace. 

It's like rewound time 3 years newborn toddler ways, right kids getting old enough become independent regaining time myself, we're right back square one.

Distance learning Spring difficult, made through, continue fall. I'm looking forward it, honest.

But annoying, mild inconvenience hopefully temporary. love kids, I'm introvert plus husband working home around day making extra noise mess means never get recharge time anymore ""job"" gotten much harder. 

So yeah, understand parents' frustrations. love family want spend 24/7 months end. 

But, husband still job. health. lucky enough able afford stay home kids makes distance learning infinitely possible, etc. privileged know it. could whole lot worse try complain much make best it.

I understand parents stuck rock hard place. essential workers really good choices here. people simply send kids back school get back work. really feel them.

But there's also families one parent work work neither essential lots flexibility work home still nanny they've boohooing actually parent this. 

There's absolutely mega rich families willing send kids potentially murder teachers Mommy still brunch whenever wants daddy keep carrying midday affairs poor them, nanny move back home care ailing family. whole lot sympathy folks. ya I'm northwest PA I'm getting bit worried again, especially bad ohio getting again... Thank you.  Holy shit  Give couple days forget he’ll back regular self.  good news test positive theres 2 days left 14 day quarantine Unless US one best recovery rates world reported covid deaths actually understated. OC really Florida California. rounded put concentration camps till comply. WE’RE NUMBER ONE! heard director EMS says negative tests 50% accurate. case 11% positive rate area, test symptoms, likely 50% positive.

If case whole COVID thing nightmare matter slice it.

We don’t fucking clue has/had doesn’t. Personally, household got hit got sick. Wife’s test came back negative won’t let back 2 negative tests negative wrong often.

We likely exposed point.

If you’re high risk group, use precaution. you’re not, you’ve likely already antibodies, least iteration virus going around now. necessarily, don’t know act long term long immunity lasts, could stay year long become seasonal (would odd given it’s worldwide time) disapear reaches containment herd immunity, disapear unknown reasons. don’t enough hindsight yet, maybe january it’ll full year we’ll good predictions sorry loss. 

A good friend mine also lost father similar circumstances, back forth months issues, COVID ended taking him. says peaceful expected long COVID, obviously hard too. 

Ya can't imagine people going family members healthy one minute sharp decline hospital ward can't visit. hope people find way feel pain sadness coming forth world right without lose someone close them. 

100% 14 new cases country 1 billion+ people Link meltdown?  problem CrossFit CrossFit knock gyms go to. air conditioning, small classes sizes, lines ground plastic dividers, mask mandatory classes wish, spraying cleaner everywhere bug killer looking device, lots sanitizing, sharing equipment, etc. YMMV outside DC metroplex, small gyms definitely taking seriously. Wait many young people extreme reactions ? States shut rest world? this?

Why leave phone on? Yea know side roads well, phone broadcasting position 12m accuracy. Wow. Wow. Government studies show people defy government entirely bad turn immediately....Hail Hydra! Arizona, humidity low enough could (and many do) use swamp cooler worry recirculating air. Florida high humidity... um, hmmm, anyone really want live Florida? Wow. Iowa allowed go half online without permission governor. old high school going back precautions wiping stuff. Couple things: 

1) Triad real criminal organization China, something saw GTA... It’s around hundreds years.

2)A triad also group things come 3’s, case Narcissism, Psychopathy, Machiavellianism. experience living south OC 90% places practicing safe guidelines 10% bat shit crazy want enjoy summer like it’s 2019. Wow. point testing longer beneficial? Like reach certain percentage population, safe assume patient covid-like symptoms covid? Bold assume graduated school, school first place. teachers would volunteer that. majority seem anything online only. point hypothetical if’s. Stop trying spread unnecessary fear, it’s pathetic. Point flu virus resulted anything like describe STFU. alcohol sales includes retail well, this'll result crowding 9:45 prevent people going late night theres likely less people

feels like excuse implement blue law use that, animal trials actually stop immune system reacting. study I've found suggested works 100 sebjects, that's barely data. According articles publish last moth debunked anyway. Hold still geht owr bullits stuff errr I’m fucking tired him. lean towards Republican policies beliefs grew Republican town want. Him. Gone. Every single piece news see man negative. It’s putting entire party bad light almost positive stupidity infecting well. voting him. Exactly. He’s idiot corrupt malignant narcissist. Nothing special going on.  husband gets flu almost every year too. Even though gets don't... except year. year February, literally sick dont know people deal yearly. flu joke. better told husband ,""if like gave flu really really hope get covid."" Yes. 94 Years young! amazing lady. God bless her. That’s literally every politician  Wow single narcissistic person FB feed announced flying family Florida weekend. Straight hotzone. Go big go home guess. official mortality 3.5%. wonder what's figure undetected cases deaths. mean degree good reason stop opening schools state pretty much stays open.

Uhh yes, definitely reduces spread huge amount... Well wrong. NYC trash, gross shithole city Going hospital. know guaranteed hospital? rona. ranked lower? Yeah think long term, start efficiency, like recombinant protein followed booster live attenuated vaccine. People like Peter Aaby suggested Polio, give recombinant protein first, get live vaccine, risk side effects runaway infection basically nil. 

The papers seen live attenuated vs recombinant viruses like Hep suggests less doses needed using live vaccines protection lasts longer etc.

Edit: ideally viral vaccines also boost non specific trained immunity, innate immune system fights pathogens better also. Yeah, got hair cut dyed, I've gotten waxed. never took mask off. Baffled comment. gym freestyle work out, classes they're regulated, spaced out, air conditioning, require mask. chart stupid.  think real argument keeping kids home stop spread. Shit going light like wildfire. Kids really significant risk death, they're going massively spread are. potential vaccine year up, think attempting contain little longer probably smart prevent downstream effects older people getting it. Ideally, risk youth could go school rest could stay home, know reasonable way implement policy like that. They’ll call kommunist wanting support fellow man. Oh god. We've truly begun explore extent damage. We’ll fuck right ass   work 95% believe that. r/oldschoolhot eh ? Sounds like bullshit make landfall. Straight FUCKING bullshit. pics recently going around actually bunch prisoners caught MlM pyramid scheme. I'm crying Texan, better way home beer midnight. (1am saturdays, woo!) 

Better hope forget pick whiskey, liquor stores close 9, sell anywhere else. 

Want grab champagne grocery store Sunday morning brunch? Tough shit, tater tits; 10:42 cashier make feel like moron, can't buy four bottles booze 12 noon. 

TX alcohol sales laws make sense. course: going BLM protest = low risk; protest = high risk. thought 190m care babies, literally hate women.  bunch people Arizona came party 4th July spiked cases. fine Personality disorder. official term arsehole. *ex-friend  someone almost hit 90% done turning lane stop sign (it turn). Proceeded pass double yellow slow down. Went grocery store parking lot follow yell ""You mother fucker"" etc etc. did, they've talking cases fatalities. blame stupid *a mask like peeing pants* memes. fucking kidding. Oh god Fuckwit. Kind topic anyone recent mortality rate studies? feel like anyone talked early I’ve barely heard anything past 2+months Many states getting New York numbers many passed Jersey much lower deaths. Asking virus getting weaker valid question, even case Soo much winning wuhan restes 9mil people 10 days I’m sure states same. /s Nail damn head. I’m kind angry society right it’s selfishness, :/ yea based this, i've already written stopping climate change basically lost cause prepare lmao.  confirm. I’ve low grade fever 3 weeks, developed cough, vomiting, diarrhea, body aches, chills, shortness breath, difficulty breathing. told docs I’m “not sick enough” tested. 

Don’t get wrong, I’m near bad plenty people I’ve read testimonies (or bad husband month ago), still sucks. sad. heart breaks family. mean, Trump...

It's painful read transcripts speech/interview does. Remember half people average, averages work. It’s honor, especially year! I'm coward wanting actually source bullshit? ask source pretty clear full it. Glad well. 

I'm raised borderline still trying heal trauma, still trying maintain harmony pwBPD even as, yet again, situation inevitably lead obvious conclusions. way always does. hurts see. mention it, try help, get told judgmental mean - person ability admit reality situation. judgmental person pass judgment disagree them. 

Even though I've done much healing, still really hurts continues hold back looking forward living life. 

While person plagued pattern, find difficult go NC still good person inside, intend best. trapped story. raised borderline parent - siblings siblings' children fucked up. 

That grandmother survived great depression. husband WWII vet, also kindest gentleman I've met. took back seat let run show cause conflict. Meanwhile, mother, great grandmother, went city work farm Wisconsin due dream husband, selling Chicago townhouse so. ended liking ""dream"" would drive town 13 children (grandmother 13th) sell goods farm - instead coming home cash he'd ask kids wait disappeared bar hours. 

So three generations trauma, four 9 cousins, representing 1 13 branches came from. 

The fact understand people refuse admit trauma means also understand cost letting go without dealt with. need face educate people change. 

Or gets worse...

Meanwhile, people even know BPD is, raised borderline children reach help, often told making things up, even counselors. picked take gone thru drive thru 4 months. miss restaurants. lot thought would. I've learned cook things I've using money I've saved eating stuff around house (like setting vegetable garden). country extremely selfish. America thinks maternity leave communism. wish joking. ”hi, I’m Karen Knoxville, welcome Jackass!” Got it. thought ‘the app’ would make work. Apple google part. Seems like state app builders haven’t. titanic wake call me, honestly never realised much people give fuck others struggling. Looking excess deaths inaccurate simply less people working travelling. ya now? guess give damn Covid. Selfish think could roam freely put others risk dying even quarantine order. would motivate anyone say something cruel stranger? asking something would NEVER get it. Feel better now? land American.   
You force poeple this. virtually nothing.
Unless count almost 45% (total) wage tax pay Netherlands, helps supporting social welfare system (among things)
We get 2 years unemployment benefits (and reduced lot last years) social minimum income long needed (but still required try get work).
Besides complete system ""allowances"" ""lower"" wages.

So, give charity since already good systems that.
I prefer helping people around person needed.

How yourself? still huge step forward. Enjoy it

EDIT : Also, 82% vaccinated enough herd immunity necessarily. Smart people narcissistic would stand smart narcissistic don’t empathy surprised people see something wrong actions. see difference empathetic smart people weren’t.

Edit: thanks answering Gotta collect tithes, amirite? Fuck safety regard human life. 

Dude, make YouTube account offer remote services. people kind fire code. 1 pos case.  lockdown lifted. indeed learned ecology. Or, better put would Herd Immunity protection infection susceptible individuals receive number immune individuals increases. Elimination disease possible provided certain threshold immune individuals met one aspect Herd Immunity. 

There absolutely fascinating history here. Like ground floor epidemiology. Take look [THE SPREAD BACTERIAL INFECTION.THE PROBLEM PDF FYI. term first used. 

They discuss need differentiate immunity individual overall immunity group. invented Herd Immunity:

_the question immunity anattribute herd studied separate problem, closely relatedto, many ways distinct from, problem immunity an
individual host._

They summarize experiment saying : 

_the results show decreasing mortality increasing proportion immunized mice_.

That phenomenon Herd Immunity. first time documented first time phrase used. simple relationship. studying eliminating disease population all. 

Now cringe realize count immune susceptible mice together. think would study way nowadays. Yes. Trump literally publicaly asked Russia help win obvious fuck paid shills started popping everywhere online. uh

you know COVID-19 influenza, right It’s edibles now. 

Why smoke irritate lungs times like much less lack sharing dangers. excess deaths still much higher though. slight overcount would dwarfed far higher excess death toll Depends they're getting tested. sure would post surgery, unless thought risk higher recovering think implication made people areas (outside cities especially) view Houston residents ""american"" NYC residents, whatever means. even think tracks Houston actually like. mean think fair say government completely given attempt contain minimize spread virus. would need nationwide hard lockdown administer tens millions tests prompt turnaround results lockdown.

It's made clear path hoping herd immunity works hoping vaccine ready able mass distributed quickly. even large minority population take it. they've bought conspiracy theories legit concerns rushed production vaccine human history. nice theory faith required, believe say look actions.

That's motto sub since February know, ""watch do, say"".

And moment China opening cinemas getting 3.2% GDP growth quarter. country competent leaders. Competent leaders would established quarantine hotels, minimum made available free cost residents nowhere quarantine risk infecting family members. Well have, answer there. prize gave money. That's all. Insane degenerate piece filth LOL, country, ever. dozen masks switch wash end week know plenty people same.

Have idiots power enough get desserts? “Narcissists may fake it, still essentially see others pawns egocentric universe — fail make real changes.” Narcissists also think rules apply special, whereas selfish people moral boundaries.” good job encouraging behavior ones blame. know man-children hate Fox News. people wear masks still claim FlU cAnCeR KiLl pEoPle  never really assumed were.

Others watched Europe observed ingrained sexism bigotry exist form maternity leave. Basically, young women hard time finding decent job employer's paranoid she'll take maternity leave 1-2 years, depending country. Sure, government pays it, women advance much slower rates lowballed first job (Europe US). Universal leave bust. punish unmarried childfree employees (male/female/binary) *their* choices. 

That said, kids *are* major impediment woman's career. Even woman ""returns"" mat leave, reduced hours, calling due kid, lack care father contribute. Men kids benefit, there's definite reason it. Aside gender roles, men generally responsible childcare household; nearly always woman. area hit hard, SEE called overflowing hospitals, clearly lying never hit full capacity. /S

Everytime hear get deeply confused people think hospitals work, leave sick people lobby, Healthcare workers saying overflowing. Call crazy, somehow doubt conspiracy. Ummmm... DUH!!! Username checks  soundbite going living head rent free next months. *Ugh* prefer Trump candidates, fucking stupid. VIRUSES INVISIBLE, CAN'T GET HEAD. Shit, Jared already took victory lap patted back well month ago. I’m sure he’s back fixing Middle East now. going comment ""what piece shit"" see already top comment. I- *irritated didn’t encourage masks like 7 freaking months ago*

hey, let’s look positive side! least finally wearing damn mask lot redditors California likely undercount tbh. pandemics uncommon reported deaths lower especially limited testing available etc. surprised years final death toll adjusted higher reported. honestly article say kids Well explains trump   Polls Stop downplaying it. America terrible. difficult wear mask hairdressers/esthetician? I’ve going regularly Italy months since reopened worn mask entire time every appointment. know compare two dates time?

Compete 1/2/3month averages. also trade securities based 7d also look recent historical data?

Again, you’re freaking +100-200 increase, want disregard it’s decrease 1000??

Thats use percentages instead actual numbers. A/C always external air input ensure ventilation without indoors recirculating.

I feel like countries everything except mask requirement. Ventilation important reason health officials basically ignoring this, we've learned nothing virus since March. much higher, particularly among people 45. COVID deaths spiking state, 14 excess deaths every COVID death among people ages 20-44 (51 COVID deaths, 728 total excess deaths). Let’s honest. Like anything scripted single ounce trump words. Yet another glaring shortcoming US system everything. right screw organs. He’s going wind alienating fanatic base thinks virus hoax wearing masks infringes rights. really missed mark election cycle. He’s simpleton. It’s like see 5 brain cells rubbing together speaks. Oh fuck sake...c’mon. You’re right dude...everyone going die virus!!! Careful...you’re resistance showing. Fake new, kids get COVID.

(This sarcasm, btw. shed light ridiculous notion kids get it.) Better safe drunk than, well, know.  Sure. go right back old self soon gets re-elected. 122,000? many Covid related deaths reported US?  dumbass move ~~calculated guess~~ Soooo ... freakout? I've seen one, ultra disapointed  AKA ex-husband. say Dude...how old you? gotta stand right kid. believe COVID deaths counted, anyone link pneumonia death statistics comparison COVID death statistics 2020?  I’m really sorry loss. hope insensitive, comorbidities? Maybe need 'make america great again' tar feather woman? Nice “diversity inclusion” example. guess doesn’t count it’s diversity opinion perspective. Yea actually getting bit hopeful movements started take past summer. Politics sucks... 130k preventable deaths I’m sure grandparents told mom 5 kids living stop babies can’t afford! Chaotic life? like irresponsible let parents care 5 kids can’t care for. 🤦🏻‍♀️ life isn’t shitty person made shitty choices. shut month? Congrats. doubt would make much difference. lack empathy great they'd one liners ready right got plugged vent. Trump marketing. That’s way make sense decisions nonsense says. doesn’t matter whether something attached reality facts don’t matter anymore. truth shall set free! talking about, Bay Area mostly liberal  Remindme! 30 days Biden wins, Trump's acceptance required.  
The 20th amendment makes clear little vagueness wording January 20th noon, Trump longer president. 

Even somehow stopped elections occurring, would still longer president moment. 
Instead, order succession would put either Nancy Pelosi Pat Leahy, Democrats, office.

That said, that's still 2 months Trump office dread he'll timeframe. gods name going country right now. Sadly seems heading direction. :/

Today's even got pending 230+ cases (still counting) Tokyo alone; definitely time promoting domestic travel. Okay, I'm delusional. Sell rot boys.

Could non-smokers less likely experience severe symptoms covid either contracting asymptomatic cases, severe cases, smoke less likely die? misleading headline since per-capita comparison done. Also, understand vast majority new cases Orange County densely populated conservative strongholds. similar flu. Always us, always dangerous, yearly vaccine needed. tested loads Brits. aware Oxford US? Oxford vaccine developed university Oxford England. I'm sure mean say ""our vaccine"". literally can't see name ""Kenneth Copeland"" without thinking anymore: [Wind God probably peaked cases (unless CA continues rising faster states dropping)

Not sure that. rate positive tests still insane, backlog huge. even US already peaked, it’s long way peak. deaths peak days later. 

In countries took around 1-2 weeks deaths go peak. Good thing needed study that. Money well spent It’s sunny days logic dictates virus Not. us.

Yea, agree you, said, leaders don't. many people read comparison, similar severity infectiousness. 

All together, wish people would stop making comparisons flu, rarely helpful all. Less talking, searching recent articles please 😘 sectarian class bigotry

most anti-vaxxers white, middle-to-upper class people; ones actually suffer choices poor. common sense. Another lockdown? fuck first? countries definitely lockdown, still bull shit ""essential* businesses open. pathetic American? LP stores, hire guards walk store remove wearing mask. bam people life.

Seriously, wrong people? can’t content use Skype meetings?? can't tell explain joke used source.  work high school comment isn’t funny.

It’s hilarious! 24th cases per million. 

30th deaths per million. Whatever, mature grown ups NEVER play action figures. Loving logic Sooo mask going kill you, respiratory virus? Got it. Burning people stake rubbing rabbits skin might also treatment option COVID-19.

These weird arse news sites getting click baity. huge jump South Africa's recent daily average around 100-200 deaths.

Does anyone know backlogged deaths old probable deaths? find specific information this. well, yes, everybody late, went recommendations. ordered tests december, anybody knew would become pandemic, wouldnt mess first place. 


Edit: also dont know production facilities located. guess since masks required state months now, people used it. I've seen one berate challenge employees everyone actually wear mask. suppose states mask mandate still don't, could see bad employees. still think could help people wearing masks not, even ignore person door. ""And huuuge"" Retroactive reporting? happened India today Eh, they’d never remove right-wing populist power, left-wing leaders. don’t disclose fucking mandate!! Either hire security door ensures entrance prohibited without face covering. *""Nobody could seen coming""* I'm defending recent trend CA's covid cases, pretty bad, ranked 24th country infections per million, bad headline suggests. Ranked 28th deaths per million

(Source  but...but...der trumpenführer *promised* would.

Where say right way? asked it, that's answer, realize time *were* England?

Horses also effective form travel, also used swords javelins battle would consider now, little armor. We've advanced technology problem look history darwinian eye. conquest way societies advance, works criticized.

See there's thing talking before. lack lot empathy sexually assulted, tortured, forced enslavement murdered time somewhere seem putting separate view morality it.

Yes. greatest country one wealth technology, useless living allow access even live comfortable life without breaking effect saying societies either accept responsibility horrors...or victim horrors. 

I absolutely saying need accept past atrocious, need make things right. 

By ""be victim horrors"" referring saying example accepting responsibility? so, *no* fucking idea like victim something. Accepting personal responsibility mature admirable, feel guilty sure, making right make one done wrong feel better ignoring hurt first means there's way society exist pride power. case, adjust standards. US, opinion, society proud of. 

You know Germany still thing right? admire shit them. saw we're ashamed happened. started paying reparations within 10 years, teach detail, many classes actually go sites themselves. Acknowledging history important repeat it. illegal memorabilia Germany they're strict that.

You know white supremacists now? US! (Well we're honest always had, follow said figure) We've also performed genocide, continue allow people opressed murdered due different *Land Freedom!* assume believe title, I'm curious means moment history.

That last bits favorite ""In case, adjust standards.""

Followed immediatly ""The US, opinion, society proud of.""

How low bring them?

Jokes aside, US could great country barely fufill definition Society.

""the community people living particular country region shared customs, laws, organizations.""

This could us, laws apply others. people sorts cultures living here, yet... scream learn English make fun traditions. true. far lower degree help exists today. Many speak language know customs. learn, make name. children taught primarily American customs, next generation knew nothing old country, quite ready call Americans equally suspicious new immigrants. That's right way welcome people. 

You're going need try wording different way rollercoaster confusion.

Are saying immigrants helped *now?* they're reason dropped culture? reacting immigrant suspicion ""right way"" welcome one country???????

Please specify beliefs want go huge tangent different interpretations words reveal character. said, ""my people,"" appositive was, ""my friends, neighbors, family."" that's took as. ""your people"" includes millions. millions friends? see part class millions? criteria class? cohesion have?

I'm Christian, friends, neighbors, family entire human race. moment people referring specific ones mentioned, told take ones want out. difference me, see class status, see beauty capitalism, adjusts. market jobs dried up, price would rise. case, construction factory workers tend appreciative country disdainful.

Would say cashiers appreciated right now? certainly paid like are. 

That answer question anyway? **WHO'S** going it? you? Everyone thinks going back work right need survive entitled definition. tell right Karen's going scrubbing prefer taxes lower, also want low 1% make money, bring products market, hire workers, raise investment portfolio, etc. 

That's thing though, use 99% money businesses. taxes get higher drown take chunk even affect loves 1%. change number.

You also realize bigger company gets likely outscource work countries? Look apple every 24h call center. lot cheaper pay day workers another country pay Americans work nights. cheaper pay child American adult because... rights! One things seem proud of. feel *insert gadget here* made people deplorable conditions think sitting thrones cash. Thrones cash grow. Investments do. Investments simply efficient way think future. those--efficiency planning--are call progress.

If stretched Mark Zuckerberg's earned 2018 throughout entire life point, he'd still made around $6mil DAY! obviously way knowing going, may investing it. Even so, stuck number regular paycheck schedule paid every 14 days he'd still make 21mil every two weeks. chose apply tax per day he'd still earn 1.5 mil day. enough invest, donate, living comfortable life. able find schools, feed homeless, economy would better overall.

The answer also aspects used here. Yes, found efficient cheap way make lot money. investing said money US economy. paying US workers make stuff, take money outside think lives comfort served better materials. either-or.

The blatant privilege show. realize majority US access materials? willing hold back those, even little, order better life neighbor shows care materials life.

Also remember listing, faster cars, better movies, etc. necessities, therefore, luxuries. Unfortunately can't look back previous comment without erasing reply took far long write check facts. 0.58% would middle confidence interval. someone Northeast whose wear mask months, it’s mind boggling places without mask orders right That's lock everything again.

This obvious solution since February anyone brain thought handle outbreak. whole *point* shutting New York City such. idea shut economy ensure *everyone gets bed get virus* absolute misunderstanding situation. 
 
And unfortunately seems even leaders (governors president) public health officials understand premise either. tested positive Covid-19? What’s story behind rise power anyhow? Didn’t Brazil legit socialist president within last years? 

I assume rise presidency happened model Trump’s, really don’t know much it. comes great steaks, I'VE RAISED STAKES positivity rate still little lowest ever been, definitely peak still. Patrick dumb. board program kids special needs, event recipeitns program parents, basically implied majority kids special needs way sue partes drugs pregnant.

Mind like 15 years ago, never left mind. One Co workers parent attendance day, child also recipient benefits program, hr students, students sever special needs. drug use induced, rare genetic disorders. definitely misguided dumb. No, don't, usually. nowhere near testing capacity that. Unless using screening test. Pussies. I'll party lose money shareholders pissed. Even broken clock right twice day. They've already admitted they're skipping parts testing peer review process. I'm anti-vaxxer want take vaccine undergone proper testing. right parents gonna take florida week graduating college year. 4 days Disneyworld hit parks. that’s window :( There's place send test free. buy bulk somewhere know supply chain change. I'm diagnosed MCAS (though ny symptoms fit fairly well), doctors really understand what's wrong MCAS seem consideration UK generally, like keep eye possibilities.

Anything suffer less 😒  shop I’ve worked children 2-12 years old next? Exorcism? Poor chap loves thread :D Northeast basically things right. infection curves look like places solid mandatory lockdowns. I'm glad resonated you. :0) long baby/kid knows he/she loved always be, shelter clothes food belly, kindly encouraged best selves, fine job. stuff secondary things.

My kids 23, 20 almost 12. stumbled along way know loved matter always place home need it, matter age. would trade journey money fame world. wish childhoods pass blink eye. look back two twenties yesterdays spent, feels like instant. goes 11 year old...it's like, baby ten seconds ago. :0)

I hope enjoy raising kids much did. feeling (and will). We've tried nothing work! I'm lawyer, ex custody rights all, I'd try taken away based believing videos site. Ooooo spicyyyy! Thanks translating. Ha ha New York. Get life losers. 3 month resistance infection, never getting rid this. cycle cycle infection, recovery, infection, recovery body breaks die choking liquids. 

Biblical shit right there. Perhaps time give people opportunity merciful end. catch it, put down. replied comment when?

Lol wasn’t one government either. 

It government dual citizen. Well smart thing would go back lockdown hospitals overwhelmed many areas.

The original lockdown prevent spread give medical professionals time gather supplies. 

Federal government failed people ignored China January. vaccine isn’t going eliminate Covid. Fauci said much today. forever, like flu. 

Let’s honest, spin people don’t hold logical position. Lmao, went safe space made post. Seriously, makes meless likely want wear one, I'm understanding

Such /r/LeopardsAteMyFace material right here. (for part)

For part operative words here. probably effectively eliminate virus major concern believe will. Assuming go animal populations, follow suit vaccine?

There’s still issue vaccinating enough population effectiveness vaccine. vaccine 100% effective. effective aren’t. don’t provide perfect long term immunity. 

One recent vaccine candidates read 80% effective provided 4 months antibodies, unknown immunity duration. impossible keep large populations current anything developed cooperative countries vaccine doesn’t convey long term immunity. according rumours... But, muh medical condition! Probably something like:

0.1% 0.5% mention, screw republicans? think oxford talked end year. i'm guessing they're assuming good treatments then, vaccine fails protect. Heads everyone glory holes aren’t like pornos it’s guy almost always receiving side. go Craigslist start searching There’s 60,000-100,000 test backlog feels like less testing done every week. Queensland Health responded request saying ""does meet threshold exceptional circumstances"".

By 20,000 AUD Why? changed? True. think it’s hard generalize comes whole situation factors must take account. I’m saying it’s hard believe millions protesting close proximity several days not, least part, contribute coronavirus spike. based what? every country opened spikes pic reminds past stupidity old people die""

Anyone thinks would change minds personally watch funerals/rehab appointments people spread to. There's difference ""I spread old lady died"" VS ""I killed auntie beatrice baked cookies whole neighborhood week, leaving family little dog despair."" Ah, okay there's basis action. mean testing people without symptoms, might asymptomatically infected. Absolutely, wasn’t really saying much disagreeing lack empathy, moreso caring infecting others may far worse outcomes. scenario people face infections continue grow. point, refusing everything possible reduce spread held accountable. It’s longer “accidental” point.

Beachgoing, vacationing, general disregard precautions really driving infections right now. may additional add protesters much media spinning.  Vacationers particular huge population...and often going indoors without practicing safe distances proper mask usage...and even two precautions foolproof virus insanely infectious indoors I’m buying surgical masks, provided free company. However talk supply could slow employees encouraged use cloth masks can. 

Also CDC guidelines recommend using multilayer cloth masks non-healthcare workers, surgical masks. I’d rather save surgical masks healthcare workers need most. Public health scientists known decades tell people things “won’t help,” end population gives safe entirely YOLOs it.

People congregate together home, too. will, fewer restrictions, continue try ban non-essential activities restrictions. Yea-I remember last flu season Lombardy NYC bring refrigerated trucks dig mass graves. Happens every year! pause phases either, going phase one phase two couple weeks apart. 

They instituted phase one, waited see effects would come (allowing drawn time frame virus follows course) even considering phase two. 

Couple lack consequence, enforcing outlines mentioned, perfect resultant recipe clusterfuckery... populations. point falls without even made.

Obviously need properly codified criminal offences breaking isolation quarantine. countries work. need public servants actually follow regular checking isolated people. Taiwan properly. call centre operators ring private number, nobody picks up, consequences. bother? needed mask rules month ago more, coupled government ensuring supply. surgical mask manufacturer Victoria. intellectual property machine use materials made Australia. capable million masks week stockpile public distribution. Again, Taiwan thing within weeks pandemic beginning. We've months masks price gouging. need non essential businesses closed everyone locked least four weeks. thing bring us back 400+. want use coronavirus implant tracking devices. wants implant tracking devices. /s agree, comparing April kinda pointless. Much changed since then. 

And think good point, community spread probably worse April. However destructive impact spread doesn’t appear bad compared April (so far), considering much know covid now, recent hope showing decreasing new hospitalizations last couple weeks. Experiencing Homelessness

Is new euphemism homeless people? No, know them. would better could get everybody vaccinated. vaccine people sensible enough get would least better current situation. totally get everyone right reproduce much want. However 2+ kids you’re poor financial state, you’re screwing kids future.

It’s hard give attention kids make sure succeed many. anything putting stress that. 

People need think fuck. want kids, free birth control provided government Planned Parenthood.

Now counter argument people poverty aren’t taught given ability really plan future. However, think somewhat common sense situation. 

People know abortions. People abortions know wear/take birth control.


Environmentally, believe families kept 2/3. Every year 130 million people born. far year Covid taken 700,000 people.

Reasons diseases like even exist humans push environment. want meat, dispose hundreds pounds trash. make available everyone, unhygienic practices.

The planet earth **carrying capacity** see prepare care enough repercussions growth. Shit interesting 50-60 years. “Covid-Organics” huh? 

Good luck that....... 2 groups ~~youtubers~~ people California.

In California I've found between. They're either taking seriously stayed home since April, huge birthday parties.  Yeah flew Prague last weekend, like 2019 here. Pilsners flowing strong, everything open. People keep saying pandemic politicized, really one side following science denying it. 

For example, Trump finally recommending masks, Democrats suddenly reversed course come anti-mask. KNOW got ass beat Easy. Close vendors stop eating usual bag thing bag check. sure people least drinking protests. First lot shit saw stuff sober people rarely do, second, heat, couldn’t active without getting dehydrated soon. fact saw news stands set people get refreshments police hunting destroying. protesters eating drinking. Aight

Look stooopid muricans going MAGA FREEDUMBS! RIGHTS! WANT TALK RONA MANAGER! CANT BREATHE MASK! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!

joke aside, masks asymptomatic, protection others.. someone without mask sneezes direction amount masks help you

Denmark 4% masked socially distanced back start outbreak 300 active cases reaching 15k active social distancing works I'd say hospital provable he'd never admit symptoms Maybe third time charm. didn’t help? dude basically working still weeks virus without major complications. figure ”no effect”? recommendation tip firm rule, according website."" Or, know, they’re listening science. sub likes science supports dreams living home shut inside forever normalized need put colored bracelets people positive quarantining. bracelet public, authorities called get fined, hauled home GPS ankle monitor. break quarantine again, get hauled secure hospital bed jail quarantine up. people properly quarantined, time health department officials remove band give clear. time bracelet tampered with, they're fined. Yes Lololololol

So lied months changed minds even though evidence goes back 100 years. 

Do even know lied masks? USA Canada?

When ontario institute mandatory mask policy since cared much people? Don’t worry, dumb asses plenty. Even Red Foreman would get worn out. respond person, bad faith actor trying garner negative responses. means given lurker reads comments happens operate emotional level logical level, likely give creedence depravity. Best downvote move on. talking adds spectacle. Usually can't ignore problems expect go away. different. fun mock 2) vaccines targeted enough virus easily mutate avoid vaccines we're sorta back basically vaccines all.

Don't worry this. vaccines targeting spike protein (the one binds ACE2 receptors), pretty mutate-resistant. probably need booster shots though keep AB levels ward future infections. Yes. want summer break. leadership keep DC want. many people US unironically believe causality Refusing follow public health guidelines also like punishing whole bunch people make decision. Refusing expand medicaid coverage state also punishing whole bunch people like make decision.

""I agree leadership's decisions, gimme"" get anyone anything level government. can't use argument access medicaid expansion state turned option, state explicitly said ""if defy us bail out"" are.

As always, dissatisfied citizen's option select different leadership. move. agree long said countries need use masks get really low levels really good contact tracing.

All rich countries failed that. Asian countries successful. Add New Zealand list.

Impatience officials ignorant brought us current place. way be. countries learning really hard way.

I actually called months ago eventually would wearing masks. saw Asia measure worked without shutting economy. predicted countries would start using masks realized either wear mask see economy go drain. Money talks, eventually.  Thought settled Rona DeathSentence ""undergrad"" physics graduate work quantum chemistry/physical chemistry. chemist physicist. got shot arm haven’t since, damn COVID! Yeah, I’m pissed 2 ways. vast majority I’m pissed people continuing die can’t get collective shit together. 

But also, I’m pissed lack empathy, mostly people literally risking people’s lives, know what?

Some also rest. people say big deal. Idk I’ve gone functionally mentally ill downright mentally unhealthy. broken. *have* panic attacks wearing mask (especially kn95, wear work) suddenly brain decides can’t breathe. *do* want nothing able go gym again, maybe get back I’ve lost hate shitty abused body little less. *have* become stir crazy neurotic mess feel like tiger trapped cage small (or maybe like dumb ant eater idk). *truly* miss friends thought introvert could, even though barely even text.

But still things anyway killing people around important destroying myself. I’m gonna sit act fucking high mighty I’m pretentiously enlightened isn’t hard.

This isn’t thing pisses most, it’s thing sub needs hear. % chance catching corona wearing mask socially distant extremely low. 

Them confronting angry person doesn’t want wear mask trying kick store bit risk that. Published April 7th. 

Seems little date. attaching first link came across referencing study Johns Hopkins, thanks downvoting citing reddit comment response non cited comment. seen article Dr's experience patient getting it, testing negative twice getting again, worse second time.

Sounds like false positive first time. officially tested? results? dont think understand death rate means border open anyone else without testing everyone arrival like Iceland? UK get memo. hate this. It’s supporting bad behavior, case wearing mask. We’ve become passive following consequences. Masks aren’t big deal one. Two, person isn’t wearing one, asked either wear one leave. refuse, police called person cited trespassing. Windows Pico running Borg nanoprobes. Yup, great union company, shut back end February. health insurance till September.  OK, increase reduction infections? true Finland's friend. &lt;3

Dunno see ""bump"" [official Suspect Worldometers polls total day misses date adjustments. ..., 4, 6, 5, 5, 9, 6, 6, 3, 10, 3, 0. couple diseases ever eradicated though? everyone country voted people currently power. seems big man charge keen getting way voted out. 

Not mention, realistic voting options president Dumb Dumber, doesnt seem like oppose truly vote interests. neutral never count them, unless bill needs paying. Bless man. me, would tempted say ""Why would track vaccine? I'm already tracking facial recognition since none wear mask!"" ""indian"" friend one behind Maybe collectively, I’m already seeing posts saying since deaths won’t surpass nyc/nj, it’s bad lakes getting low cases per 100k late June went - right around phase 3 yes people drive many people vehicles compared mass transit Yup. ""But know really working?""

Same way knew really working before, work gets *done.* 

If work getting done - reports late, answering emails writing stuff expected timely manner, got bigger problem employee's physical location. don’t know sure T-Cells seem provide immunity necessarily. studies prophylactic effect smoking seems Parkinson's. incidence people got PD lower among smokers people consumed nicotine ways. shoulder shoulder outside cheering favorite sports team isn’t either.

Have actually ever sporting event?

Good luck keeping people eating drinking. really dumbass

I guessed right Cause research first.  warned *last year* pandemic coming. leaders elected people. People need understand voting person, trusting official best interests safety mind. Saves money?
You dont understand even basic aspects economics work. 

Recessions happpen folks dont cash, credit spend. economic contagion people spending echoes entire economic system. 

Lets say 200 coworkers get laid jobs company. us used go get lunch coffee office buildings bustling cafe wont going cafe. cafe cant buy sandwhich meat one buying sandwhiches anymore. truck driver delivered meat gets screwed, gas station, mechanic lose business, trucking companies acountant goes lower, paycheck firm looses client, farmer providing meat, feed supplies providing farmer list fucking endless. 
Everyone gets hurt second someone looses job money previously spending vanishes tge economy. 
By putting $1 stimulus evonomy, get back many multiples spending dollar. investment instantly grows. Giving billionares causes tgem sit like smaug protecting gold. vanishes people laid off. upside, countries getting ready wave 2 since end wave 1.

So, there's chance wave 2 bad wave 1. not, many things go wrong, we'll see. wouldn’t it? It’s literally walking example such. Empirical evidence.

I love it’s science it’s not. meds on, any. HCQ? Remdesivir? Getting covid 50,000 closest friends stadium essential! YOLO! problem case like this, though, punishing every single resident county, I'm sure 100% supported local leaders decisions... Ok evidence every single state worse 99% world one SINGLE state (whose population cited incorrectly) worse one single place world? joke!

NY infection rate around 800/day 20 million people FAR better (often twice good more) entire countries lately:

Israel

South Africa

Iraq

Oman

Bolivia

Kazakhstan

Kuwait

And on...

And New York lowest infection rate country either. Various states better. Stop lying fear-mongering start looking data make stupid claims.  Thank compassion; you, non-citizen, showed care one sentence president five+ months ravaging country. lot people pride American deluded believing great country. Broken, example rest world different cultures people intermingle. I've always known something wrong country young age, always bullied part handful Asians hometown, current events brings public eye. 

You're wrong shitty here. days, wonder find another place settle down. guess we're willing fix problems encounter, we'll stuck matter go. Hopefully others feel way. Well talking directly safe assume say something me?

Yeah I'm Canadian figure out. read Russmans voice [spike deaths 1918 began 4 weeks school resumed. School closures effective means stopping spread back then. people claim they’re trying “Christlike.” perfect option! bullshit fear mongering, wouldn’t expect anything less subreddit 

WE’RE DOOMED Please give facts. consumers upset know government works. best way. try get involved, congress can't help friends easy. imagine actually paid attention? really unfortunate feel you, option Wolf collective punishment county actions county's elected officials. language people speak money, motivated ignore state government restrictions. act Wolf hits hurts really sucks collateral damage, necessary. Wanna know saddest part? 
increasing testing yet still far behind running testing resources federal government begun withdrawing funds testing

For example, Arizona backlog 100,000 tests running vials.

Also Chris Wallace pointed day, increased testing 37% positivity rate increased 190%. say since world end, bad Antibodies active part defence. may disappear pretty quickly. *not* mean body forgets threat. Next time, get antibodies right away, body remembers. even issue? celebs home secluded locations they’re spreading anything. Normal 94 100, pulse oximeter readings affected skin pigmentation, especially lower levels. Depending design may read children's fingers well. important try repeatedly see work accurately you, also know normal is. Mine right around 98. husband's closer 95. dropping 90 noticeable alarming say husband 93. even that, willing risk people’s lives.... drum circle! Universal basic income way, don’t need everyone working, good thing stupid waste much short lives slave money food shelter. expect living civilized society.  omg guy michigans associate professor psychology. LOL. things gets funnier

this stupidest thing read long time. like onion science. thanks good laugh.

i dont think even proof-read submitting it. used methanol, they? magical 🧙🏻‍♀️ serum cure Cambridge- shout eliminate outright? sounds like flaming piece crap well numbers increasing Masks never really advocated. distancing deemed enough. ( due limited supply feared toilet roll behaviour masks healthcare would without)

now voices getting stronger masks. especially indoors like bars etc.
(how work dunno)
but yeah population 17M weekly 900 positive tests (was 400 last week)
so getting worse people fed social distancing...
Which understandable anti normal.
but hell also pretty stupid. least he's marketing beans middle pandemic say going well would understatement.

Is meant say? would say CA still shitshow. Cases still rising. Hospitalizations still rising. evidence transmission dropped one. 

There slightly positive signs curves seem leveling off. However, would attribute mask mandate re-closing. think early say that's working intended not. Kinda whole point arguing higher unemployment bonus people aren’t making living wage go back. 

Nothing exists vacuum. people saying 6 months savings also say minimum wage $7.25 fine unskilled workers shouldn’t make more, yet essential economy... 

no business running shoestring budget pay employees minimum they’re allowed, are, go business replaced successful venture. People fine sacrificing individual, stand behind oligarchs “elite” make sure stay rich.

We billionaires got backs modern day slaves, whether it’s minimum pay U.S. actual slaves overseas. bogus argument put forward continue forcing people work maximum hours minimum pay, keep protesting fighting rights.

TLDR; $600 bonus seems extraordinary people used getting paid shit. reality, regular jobs always paid better. seem passing knowledge genetics biology. general agree sentiment, phrasing misleading best. say virus ""want"" kill host true, viruses shown ""want"" anything. general less lethal viruses spread better, always true. incorrect say viruses want live host. That's crazy. dumb

That's ironic IMO nowhere North America proper lockdown. Want see efficacy real, verily imposed lockdown political BS? Look East Asia post-first wave. Archive http:// archive. is/dFWCZ Yes agree extent, entirely.

Our system always partisan - emergent property rules system.  founders seemed (at least them) party system, too, again... consequence system itself.  Barring change rules, always two major parties, politics thus tend partisan.  That, far I'm concerned... way is.  

But agree strongly go far.  start demonizing using war-like language political discourse, think destructive society.  (Much competition; competition friendly, peaceful, compassionate context potentially rewarding enjoyable... taken seriously far, damaging many ways.)

I agree you, also, brothers sisters try see way.

On hand, think modern day right-wing politics much based inside/outside kind dichotomy process ""othering.""  inherent fascist politics.  significant portion population basically told second rate citizens best, belong worst (actually, suppose worst, people would advocate elimination certain people based ""other."").  

As see it, country built idea everyone equally valuable, see need willing take strong stand towards end.  also think belief interlinked human life value requires us demand better treatment women, POC, LGBTQ people, working class, poor, etc.  This, course, feeds back ""partisan politics,"" unfortunately.

But agree things gotten way poisonous/toxic, try constructive, positive, compassionate.  again, much agree post. Reality check.... it. comment idea.  novel H1N1. swine flu outbreak hit same, however genetically stronger thanks ancestors living it. got H1N1 affected immune system year. awful. Worst hit terms raw numbers, per capita? We're populace state union, raw numbers may tad misleading.  boyfriend coronavirus early March, quarantining home extremely difficult due this. quarantine bedroom sleep couch two weeks. one bathroom apartment clean approximately 10-20 times day every time someone house used it. One day doctor scolded said still sharing bathroom else supposed do? two bedroom apartment, entire time thankful didn’t live studio :( 10% population gets seasonal influenza year, 60-80% people predicted catch coronavirus (if vaccine allowed spread). that""s 3600% - 4800% deaths seasonal influenza. Great. exact thing. run everything risk calculator head. It’s tiresome keeps us around us safe. 

Cheers you. confess paying attention peer reviewed studies involve mask usage. We're early enough think science trustworthy enough importance me. 

We're also early enough rate reoccurance could 1%, likely noticed yet. Somehow someone getting infected second time really appear radar hospitals overflowing. 

""...reinfection SARS-CoV-2 seems long slow march denial many. eradicated one disease, small pox. Yes safe Need monitor blood oxygen level daily basis, probably several times day. I've seen many cases patient felt fine staying home, drop suddenly, death within 24 hours. 

Everyone get oximeter point (they dirt cheap widely available), test daily find needs hospitalized immediately. interconnected one hundred years ago. Perhaps causes discrete waves seem like one continuous flood. initial rise cases US due situation northeast. New York surrounding states enacted public health measures, descended peak cases, effectively lowered localized wave. effort occur rest states. 

As nation, yet dealt effectively pandemic. 

Most population gotten virus *a first time*. never gets better it? Seriously dangerous.

I also ready interesting journal study think somewhere 1,000-2,000 people. found stronger dosage/exposure virus severe wider variety symptoms have. Much like E.Coli even radiation, minor exposure provide minor condition/illness major exposure might leave like either doctors.

I wonder they're sick? doctors higher exposure rate? 

Shit, quick Google - even new educated this, speculating. hold fact.) trying tell there's advertising hell? Sold! I'm talking soccer football mate I'm European disagree sentiment, cancer killing 550,000 heart disease killing 650,000, really ""unfathomable?"" Even absolutely nothing COVID, we'd see lots deaths year trickle pretty much continuously much lower numbers, probably seasonally. Looking 10 years so, cancer/heart disease killing 10+ million is, imo, truly unfathomable thing going here. world locked 4 weeks time, extent New Zealand, might chance! Countries aren’t getting control dooming rest world. likely according statement already mutated I’m sure means. study tested 20 samples. exactly right.

Poor prognostic factor people coronavirus subreddit, despite sitting subreddit 12 hours day, understand antibody test positive test?

meaning he's completely fine? know vaccines take long develop test, considering sometimes succeed (AIDS vaccine?).

Call glimmer hope maybe authorities cutting protocols, looks like Moderna getting ready start producing 1 billion vaccine doses, guy know mentioned vials produced. Careful- that’s fantasy people. almost like country killed 50 million people great leap forward let's workers treated like slaves even let express opinions respect people. Shocking. many disease irradiated (for part), like measles, polio, chickenpox, etc... Assuming go animal populations, follow suit vaccine? Thanks Nope, I'm presenting such; that's incorrect interpretation. Maybe emotional. nice quantitative analysis shown naysayers. still belittle results say facts

Edit: Grammar also disinfectant everywhere least easily protect yourself

Heavy breathing reason. Disinfectant doesn’t shit airborne transmission. cure stupidity. ""Less inclined""

Easter, surely *What say you* I’ve seen, timing protests coincide reopening major cities, data bit conflicted whole. Wait minute here! mean say testing cause COVID? Give evidence, call hogwash lies! Lies, tell you! 
Totally agree social media.

Doesn’t matter area Columbus I’m in, people don’t seem care. don’t get it, stubborn stupid? 

My family continue distance wear masks making mandatory trips question long selfishness others? I'm sorry what? NYC, endured 2.5 month lockdown empty hospitals 20% unemployment going lockdown again? absolutely love giving credit, fact wish opportunities so. Lol irony. 

How everyone else keep $600 get extra $200. 

You obviously need bitching much money. definition ""proper testing"" skipping several steps testing review process order rush vaccine door. keeping previously established standards ""anti-vax?"" Americans: presenting scientific fact trying lend creedance insane claims pass scientific muster. RF engineer tell paper filled nonsense. good people sides. Sounds familiar, lol. Costco guy got fired. favorite local spots gonna get replaced “local” chains subsidiaries major conglomerates, offer unique flavor, dull artificial feeling like hotel lobby potted plant CDC estimate 10. Could little higher though depending testing problems. realize pandemic often congress goes recess. yet I'm lucky get even unpaid vacation. Bore da! almost think he's saying tested positive back stance big deal 100% fact. like we've forgotten take trash, ask trash please stop smelling bad. I'm still finding paper talking. Also make correction 90s. Mid 80's must remembering recombinant DNA, 4.3 RNA jump points, sure smart enough check References might help find particular interest. broad topic. Listen them, repeat points make. important, need know ignoring them.

Then ask provide evidence suggests believe in. Discredit evidence (after letting know sure read/watched it) telling truth. truth something like peer reviewed, 99% scientists think way, whatever actually applies.

Other that, can't much. would say confrontational it, ""win."" Apparently people didn’t like that. pass eventually. Lol one those? 

The people said masks work February told don’t? everyone wearing them? 

Those kinds people?

The ones wearing n95 masks knew Covid coming everyone else lol

K 24 probably places extremely bad testing. testing great it’s better study done. CDC estimate around 10X infected cases seems right.   USA:

But want sources, here's one: even quote However, outdoor events also implicated spread COVID-19, typically associated crowding carnival celebrations [65] football matches [66] suggesting risk transmission linked crowding even outdoor events.

For USA, 4,093,786 cases, 146,045 deaths, 1,932,089 recovered patients. 

So, 146,045 deaths / 2,078,134 completed cases 7.02% CFR. 

As see different measurements IFR. heavily misleading compare CFR flu IFR covid. According data covid least 29 times deadly flu! (maybe since 0.02% IFR flu highest estimate found, 0.1% use CFR flu) read gist Twitter thread: That's IFR currently based estimates. NYC alone crude mortality rate (Deaths vs population) .248%. rate deaths occurring country increasing decreasing. gonna lie, us ~~the first~~ ~~half~~ halves!

The truth world can't prevent every action someone negative effect us, that's life.  actions taken ever truly world ending, world end we'll lost.

However, even climate change world ending. going force humanity change, can't unlucky die.  Hopefully everyone realize way forward together learn act altruistically.

There surprises. Either late prevent something not. not, try prevent it. fail prevent it, deal aftermath try improve world ensuring people held accountable punished. way everyone aware happened why, learn species better. Evan Spangenberg, 22 ... not. take trip southern US vacation hotspot. judge to. drove through, brought food, never left hotel except event attend. could observe balcony, party everywhere. pool parties, people visiting rooms, masks, people eating restaurants, etc. highways crowded almost normal volumes. 

My opinion is: Even Americans try catch virus ""get it"". think outside need mask, matter close people. inside, think mask means hang talk people right next them. Many wear masks nose hanging out. Many think washing hands, wiping things down, using sanitizer enough. think safe eat inside restaurant long restaurant spaced tables out.

Even many ""official"" messages say wash hands, stay apart, etc. messaging back March ""stuck"". People realize strongly suspect virus airborne need avoid indoors especially closed air conditioned, stay apart people, wear mask. problem see people know wear mask. addition noses hanging out, people touch time, remove correctly, wear correctly (lots gaps), etc.

The even take account ""anti-maskers"". wish got galavant. ""On hand-picked metrics, want exploit pandemic political purposes, ""

There, fixed ya. Thats point. ZERO studies show lasting effects. Worldometer says hitting 1,000 early June well, shows last time June 9. Maybe un-adjusted numbers, know...

Either way, good.

It probably rare bad luck draw happen anyone seems. Bias slant don’t make something inaccurate. 

The person you’re talking taken weird time give accurate lesson headlines written bias used manipulate. 

The person you’re talking correct. it’s clear example headlines used influence, something apparently lot people weren’t aware of. 

Even odd time give lesson. Phase 4 reopening stage, sure get talking about, nothing herd immunity. 

Even herd immunity achieved low 40% population immunity NYC would gotten half way 32K people died covid! 

Also equivalent deaths 11 9/11's ""doing excellent""... Love much Absolutely steaming take almost spit drink Ha, good. Quite ways north Texas. Whatever improves quality life. would defer question since ones risk, don’t see anyone asking one two scenarios would prefer:

1: die isolation lower standard care never see loved ones higher risk C-19 infection

Or

2: would prefer higher standard care brief remainder life, able loved ones side support say goodbye, higher risk contracting C-19.

If ask ok with, ok whatever ok with. doesn’t affect one way another, slightly higher risk contracting chose option 2. think fair take voices consideration since ones sacrifice attempts suppress spread, also carry highest risk get it.

But don’t see anybody taking wishes account. hard time believing many would prefer option one, see lots owners choosing option 1 unilaterally cover ass. sell shit movie script. unbelievable.  bad lives now.

You get infected once, breathing back virus you’re shedding isn’t going change that. doesn’t wait accumulate reproduce anything. you’re shedding virus, you’ve already infected. You’re mistaken. Make fucking N-95 masks like making bullets war. That's going right now. Every American gets 2. ROFL!!!

in 9 weeks flu season starts, flu spread much easier COVID-19.  

So far last 6 months 3.3Million people COVID-19.  

From October March (6 months) 40 Million people get flu, getting flu weaken immune system making easier get COVID-19, getting time radically increase death rate COVID-19.  

October March make last 6 months seem like dream. Reminds movie guy ran like sex trafficking thing also daughters well. give shit peoples daughters, his. Selfishness whole nother level. Same. said started heart attack I’d rather die take chance hospital catching Covid. Still,same I’d rather go fast gasping breathe last. Use Ublock Origin, mate. people LOVE playing victim. They’d 100% call police right there. do, basically live lab. Yeah, absolutely. it’s hard rewrite history he’s record (and video) saying incredibly dismissive stuff pandemic raged.

They’ll try, actually don’t think work time. Also requires Trump revert usual sulky defensiveness, which....isn’t good bet rate, yes. Doubling every 40ish days, 4-8 million would take something like 10 days per million (even though it’s linear, rough). Images movie ""Carrie"" come mind. understand; meant they're turning back 1500s.

Again China virus shit. working mindless followers, associating China something negative, taking bad light him. Pathetic. America awful country. mean compared developing countries doubt better. amongst developed countries means best arguably behind things like lacking universal healthcare system etc. that's one thing America better countries convincing everyone country better America. Great salesman. outright refusal acknowledge science admit bad situation us here. pushing mask wearing shut downs earlier turning political issue put people ease virus. Instead encouraging people vigilant encouraged apathetic. ego refusal accept bad thing control sole reason got hand. disbandment former teams, transfer team members could better jobs. chose pretend could negotiate virus paying dearly it. Naw turns they’re usual stupid greedy fucks ruining America. 4chan honey first one is. Maybe try again?  think may gotten bit lost comment thread. talking somebody going necessities life, people going maskless house parties reckless social distancing. sad thing completely favor went 100% pro mask, donned one told everyone (including supporters) ""AMERICAN"" thing fastest way get economy back business, thousands thousands people would change tune wear them, proudly it. Don’t say sorry us, say older family members. Fuck Greta thunberg. 90k anyway? knew money I've got two guesses:

1. poll numbers sooooooo shitty he's trying fix them.
2. He's lying (as usual) creating soundbites fight next stimulus bill. look forward campaign promos.  Trump never opposed masks, simply made choice wear one publicly long time. certainly finest point, still much debate effective masks are, appropriate wear them, kind, even people wearing don’t understand wearing them. lot people wearing incorrectly aren’t practicing rest good practices prevent spread. think certainly could gotten much sooner seemed become chess match media. 

First, anything president political pr doubt election polls much im sure tracking it.At point think growing number people concerned wearing masks, calls federal mandates rejection it, probably led sees compromise. wears masks sign thinks leadership example, continues reject federal mandate masks. positions well play middle road federal Mandate still supporting wearing masks.

Bottom line, reddit media continue reject choice makes, hard really get behind anything point regardless think Trump right wrong indifferent.  aren’t exactly political statements. simply opinions, she’s entitled give; particularly show believe mainly opinion show. long CDC cuts chase advises everyone prepare imminent, inevitable death? bad, read comment wrong, thought said virus carried oil droplets stopped n95. They’ll call good old boy let warning. Yes shot foot considering I’ve four years...should less ignorant agree - unless they've also terrible pneumonia outbreak there, something like must going on.

US could done better. china always brewing shit , Virus claiming Sea Land countries. 100% agree; idea point. :/ AFAIK viruses never fully cleared; many go dormant while, come back. hope would reexpression would akin low viral load someone immunocompromised would end low symptoms/transmissability, one knows. still potentially killing immunocompromised people around you. terrifying implications ever end condition requires immunosuppression.

But meant like get symptoms, responsible quarantine test results come back negative - already burned 80 hours whatever.

That means get kind symptoms again, pool already expended - even time *is* C19.

Any kind limited sick time counterproductive. Oohhhhh that’s confused me, thought NYC (I’m Canadian) pharmaceutical executives supposed make $$$ ? Nicely paid.. 😉 think calmly explained people masks effectively shield wearer severe effects 5G, politicization would stop. wait 3 days brother’s test come back inconclusive. Inconclusive?! trapped Limbo. long guy? Two weeks?  Meanwhile, inside Trump's head: ""I took hydroxychloroquine I'm still alive. definitely works."" states parents opt kids vacinee either using personal objection religious objection. states medical exemption would pronounced like culling(cul)-(de) duh close enough-sack(sac) Dude, don’t. disagree Abbott want don’t make fun fact paralyzed waist down.  Actually think Oxford one sketchy one. They're participants take Tylenol infection x amount days. Tylenol group non Tylenol group decided use Tylenol group moving forward. vaccine requires Tylenol taken days following injection? Go ask doctor what's dangerous, unprotected sex HIV positive person undetectable viral load, unprotected sex someone know status. 
It's people know HIV, controlled viral load, actually spread HIV. Study study serodiscordant couples shown people undetectable viral load transmit HIV. believe me, google it. like zombie movies people tell anyone got bit. particularly middle east, hostile vaccination programs various reasons.

[Because shit like big deal MO. get it. That’s basically every cold flu medicine commercial US.  reason can't refuses follow kind logic adherence normal people would given situation. Trump's presidency movie, one would buy it. done things he's done suffered immediate significant repercussions unbelievable. 

It looks like farce see story, tragedy looking within reality. ultimate bad script, filled unlikable, unbelievable, unrealistic characters dialogue, alongside scenarios ridiculous numerous. try imagine could possibly come next, follow kind narrative continuity expectations realize predicting random number generator impossible. anyone know accuracy tests like Walgreens offer 2 HOUR return time? I've twice lie times. I've trying muse that. Would new inhabitant better? single three biggest things requiring masks, lockdowns, enforcement. makes masks mandatory (no exceptions), still refuse. bigger answer enforcement. happens sheriffs/judges refuse enforcement? thing that's happening now...which nothing. 

If new inhabitant imposes national lockdown requires enforcement (which we've learned futile areas), mention catastrophic economy. know ""muh economy"", degree that's accurate instances preventable. whole thing (USA/capitalist/political/structure) similar Mafia. We're various levels soldiers (local/state/federal) kicking earnings (taxes).  trouble arises appeal higher ups get relief Mafia godfather/boss type.  tight national lockdown new inhabitant occurs, means American people kicking much. Subsequently, there's relief get trouble. point, tips ruin. probably true daily death rate still way peak even total cases new cases per day way higher. huge increases reported cases 4-5 states hospitalizations fatalities increased nearly much.

I suggesting anything one way think simply looking positive case count really explain what's going on. Strict authoritarian methods work. problem many western countries would refuse level intervention. Looking UK USA. see getting 80% drop hospitalizations. said Hospitalizations 4X.  Pretty sure first come first serve could wrong Higher population density makes easier spread. believe they’re assuming population population density thing and/or unaware population density varies location. good. Economy stock market go dentist without mask less risky barbershop mask?  It’s late now. 

You can’t contact trace multiple ten thousands cases day.

Germany aimed less 1k make extensive contract tracing viable country 82 million, already tracing structures place (just way small). 

The US needed lockdown ended, nothing. Like shady dealers high school sold dub 40. 

""It's good shit bro, trust me"" Imagine saying Chinese government right thing locking citizens months time, celebrating it. Man 8 months ago 😂  Translation = Trump tanking polls, wears mask maybe gain votes finally something makes sense could say exact thing US then. 

Government policies scientific research thing He's sociopath, period. british group: Ten patients suffered new onset psychosis, six dementia-like disorders - four patients diagnosed affective disorder, i.e. manic depressive episodes. / 31% 125 patients (Equals roughly 40 patients total - 20 mentioned symptoms Equals 50% patients problems roughly 15% group mix it)

Can show exact study comes from? Because, offense, find common people interpreting studies incorrectly, leaving key information.

Just glance, say something like ""from 125 patients, 4 diagnosed depressive episodes"", show episodes result COVID, right?

In random sample 125 ""healthy"" people, strange think 4 might diagnosed depressive episodes well, right? 10 might insomnia. 15 might report ""anxiety"".

So sample 125 COVID patients, could also expect this, no?

So issue ""where cause proven?"" common error find.

When hospital cancer, definitely ""depressed"" ""insomnia"" ""anxiety"". doctor asked ""Are experiencing symptoms?"" would said ""yes"". would maybe put file. wouldnt say ""neurological"" ""psychological"" conditions medically caused cancer, right?

(If x-rayed lungs, would also found lung damage. used smoke.)

Later ... doctors looked data saw every cancer patient also insomnia .. every cancer patient also lung damage *then* maybe would think interesting. would maybe *another* study prove specifically cancer causes insomnia, lung damage, happens.

But point, data says ""Out 5000 cancer patients, 15% reported insomnia, 20% reported depression, 20% lung damage"" (or something like that). cause proven. 20% bad eyesight, doesnt mean bad eyesight cancer.

Texas many coronavirus cases. governor fucking joke. wonderful contribution discussion, thanks. warned wouldn’t get money voted.... save super high number lives. Good side pandemic. think issue causing public health issue liking people get pissed situation.

Yes people respectful bar street constantly serving people sending cars drive home drunk give lot leeway rightfully angry.

I think already highly disrespectful towards customers, especially option town, side taking mask store.

Once starts respecting public health leg stand asking others respectful.

She's one causing problem also one setting mandates others deal problem created.

But original post actual line would "" Keep closed till people choose eating exposed virus. bet start wearing accepting exposure."" mean flex, I'm trying say standard companies crazy pandemic time worry HHS new data reporting system ""take care"" rise hospitalizations! It’s really weird people don’t seem mentioning stores private property means literally tell do... republicans private property people’s rights property etc.. seems like might least sliver effective dunno No. number 1 cases per 100k 2 days ago. 2/3 count per 100k tab woah, genociding native people, causing irreparable damage earths valuable forests, mismanaging pandemic alright, *wishing someone dies?* thats far buddy.

Trump idiot. ever say good grasp context. killed kid transmitting covid.

Are drugs? Different opinion = cult 3 100. That's 1 dead person every block keep seeing news Russian Chinese hackers stealing data coronavirus vaccine studies U.S.

My question is: data freely available everyone entire world? global problem need many people working much information possible time. Really bums out! constant Sweden coronavirus response apologist posts sub? need #2Little2Late. jailed number fall significantly available given free.

Especially becomes required school enrollment.  Fucking class act TB really belong list...

We've good treatment/ vaccine US stopped using back, bacteria, time evolve enough resistant many treatments used it. Totally Resistant TB actually one bigger threats human health we're probably going face next century... called White Plague reason still kills 1.5 million people annually around world. (That number, 1.5 million, 2018)

&amp;#x200B;

The Flu going anywhere likes change genome every year point immune system ready response if/when reexposed year later. Piece shit Imagine dumb antibody titers gone Memory B cells gone host vulnerable reinfection again.

Where live, people told assume tested positive get test results. use must dropping young people

Or perhaps lapses social distancing, testing tracing. work bats? think mean food deserts. evidence lack access healthy foods far complete. Why? goodly dead. world would better without him. seen badly funded education system is? talking private schools public schools funded poorly teachers often often pay school supplies pocket. Add amount people drop middle/high school, later adding misinformation conspiracies internet plus leaders actively tell lies citizens, might 100% cause sure feels like it. way love doom gloom worst-case scenario there's 0 evidence correlation getting COVID chances getting cancer makes think otherwise.

Listen science, paranoia. It’s Atascadero. Take little piece Alabama, place central coast California. Redneck enclave. surprising. However would still Trump... Brazil universal healthcare Bolsonaro still managed make ineffective current scenario. seem like - hopefully testing backlog. 

In hard hit areas, really seem point virus runs people infect vast numbers. know masks social distancing help LOT, I'm discounting that, seems like something else happens hotspots conjunction masks distancing. feel good story /s Serious question: 

I’m planning go Monday-Wednesday couple weeks, won’t visiting restaurants, Lysol condo (not hotel) stay drive there, we’ll try stop gas stations etc. checked live cameras feel like safely avoid people literally indoors since March. much risk talking here, welcome opinion something thinking want hear it. 

P.S. Rude comments ignored.  happened 2018 cause spike? remember now... Yes. been, too. people household would already exposed tested positive unless moved test. may even caught asymptomatic roommate know.

But definately wrong tell them, entire household would quarantine diagnosis confirmed, would spreading pre-symptomatic. Also, bad notifying workplace, reasons, carrying going work.

But, time, sounds like could also consequence austere living conditions (so many people sharing) lack government support help people survive lockdowns (wage subsidies, etc). probably blend together. 

What expectations?  course, data point data point. I'd rather know he's actually going through, claims ""yes, I've got it, big deal, carry on."" Imagine random person wheelchair read comment. I’m sorry! Thats awful. aunt issue kids grandkids. wave car. don’t believe real issue don’t wear masks don’t care. she’s high risk. Arizona crazy high cases (almost 100,000 county). learn history dragged deaths didn't. far right politician spain got covid, problem. One month later operated developed blood clots  rare. Percetsnge low hospitalized patients. keep yearly checkup Lmao pretty much. God it’s depressing AstraZeneca's vaccine. Oxford University's vaccine AstraZeneca contract producte part said contract Oxford requires produce without making profit. charge production cost. Oxford University stated allow anyone profit vaccine. always funny meet Europeans want live America. Like yeah, live poor African nation going major step up, I've never anywhere Europe rather live (granted I've never east Czechia). Life great top 20% so. people live paycheck paycheck, work ungodly hours, little time friends family, scared going doctor new medical problem bankrupt generally slaves jobs. graduated college 2010, making income based repayments ever since somehow still owe education started. I've literally spent entire adult life massive debt quit job wanted to. I'm pretty well compared majority Americans make well national average. Everything fucking scam government never anything laissez-faire economics fiscal conservatism. Worse, there's attitude poor fault looked upon. I’m glad we’re following “everyone human” “remain civil” rules Reddit. ah, doesn’t apply you’re berating deem opponents. Okay. think people missing voluntary isolation. half people staying isolated homes going get virus, 20% among everyone turns 40% among going out. 

It seems quite possible among people going level herd resistance reached. course would end everyone started going back again. fault job pays shit barely afford bills? dont get culture blaming individual million times this. Death far bad outcome novel disease. sucks, hope alright.

We've come far, last years shown far go. hope turn things around next generation better go things. it, save bad boy sounds like weird mix kid's show host mental patient. worked service industry one time forced stay work even though throwing up, fever, stand long. make serve tables hold tray made stay someone else could come in. sat breakroom ,sick, around employees. left would gotten fired. people serve food.  real prize Friends made along way. WTF... this? wanted mad woman, actions likely kill someone. maybe entirely fault? Maybe choice going work. Maybe household lives close quarters way could avoided infecting everyone. 

But options people.

If federal government sense, would paying covid-positive people normal salary plus $1k week isolate. managing testing issue take multiple days get results. providing quarantine housing infected people. 

And (only place) charging people crimes break quarantine testing positive. It’s likely several families living together, poverty. drop stats without sources country definitely run like business, that's sure.  Sure. want people send kids back school. It’s easy see do. easy. deaths say cases down. cases say deaths down. It’s easy spin changes everyday. Hospitals full south Florida? Brag central Florida beds don’t say central. say plenty beds available. It’s easy. Lmao obsessed Trump. Keep living limited mind thoughts trump. may suggested it, Trump OBVIOUSLY listen.

The new guy certainly took Trump's entire outward veneer - resumption Corona press briefings announced weekend new guy took over.

Trump desperate, knows losing. would ask pharmacist. Mine said local pharmacy gets flu vaccine stock August (earliest ever late July) regular flu vaccine. pediatrician daughter's vaccines gets flu vaccine stock September. varies. People fucking crazy. lady turned lane without looking. managed stop. Didn’t even honk. proceeded try “race” cut various times. one point busy yelling hit side mirror truck broke off...

Point people aggressive shits.  bought one consistently measures 97 I’ve never less 100 office setting 87,000 rednecks believe it’s hoax. Sure work! headline post: ""There growing evidence helped weather economic storm 2020 better anywhere else.""

There evidence. Sweden positioned even worse nations region cut off.

You insist believing good news coming Sweden. isn't: economy taken hit body count high.

As dime store psychoanalysis, silly. Republicans ensure tax dollars go toward corporate handouts toward welfare poor. Where's rage rich people taking money? right forcing ""communism"" rich capitalism everyone else. I'm asking question clarify something me. 

No not. [asking entire comment history mindlessly attacking Americans based utterly ignorant worldview shaped entirely reddit.

You shit human leading clearly shitty angry life. one likes come internet act like cunt. fuck American websites make something culture anyone world actually gives fuck about? People need reminded reason promoting good news like irresponsible stock market. trying stop imploding since ""vaccine good news"" earlier. careful listening private industries. seen earlier pandemic company drug promoted cure stocks rose companies misinformation. 

Look long actually takes produce efficacious vaccine.. Look graphs new cases, graph deaths. see death graph rising weeks behind case graph. We're going seeing lot 1,000 death days while. Yup, one kid almost died last month. both. don’t *want* flimsy N95...I *need* every bit hot N100, baby! beds/s scared might lose job health benefits? story doesn’t add up. give facts names william ausman. pure “let’s scare story”. It’s pure click bait. Understood. We’re talking generational changes. I’m hoping generations longer default TV information less susceptible FOX’s misinformation Internet exactly fountain unadulterated truth. 

I think better education societal shift required. - took long time get mess. We’re going get overnight. Home-ownership rate US 65% close. Copy dude Ignorance. used live poor neighborhood amount ignorance among people quite sad apparent. Made China? respectfully disagree. amount cases justify it, case equal death. case might well asymptomatic person, times is. Also, definition case broad, much even people tested positive lab presumed case. know couple people 5 state gives more. Like obviously reason love children didn’t practice contraception even though didn’t enough money knew state fall back on. know that’s inappropriate say doesn’t fit ultra liberal Reddit narrative it’s real thing. Honest question, think they'd listen entertain thought?  Maybe use teeny tiny intelligence understand interrupted conversation already progress use term specific person specific reason.

If want lumped trump sycophants, stop acting much like them. Stop derailing conversations deflect blame conversations directly related actions. Ok gotcha, that's figuring That’s crazy. get tested work know 24 hours. wish media would hound Trump response ask far behind Germany virtually every country. Keep throwing numbers every day. anti-malaria drug frequently employed COVID-19 treatment since inhibits SARS-CoV-2 spread kidney-derived cell line Vero1–3.

Ahh... Sad true... fallen far flying spaghetti monster. Please forgive us, bless us noodly appendage extra meatballs. R'amen🙏 Idk man developed countries mandate sick leave provide healthcare wouldn’t situation first place. USA totally this, doesn’t want profit people. need research. doctors said don’t that’s means.

people get hostile sub absolutely reason all.

and dude wasn’t even study, that’s webmd reporting they’ve heard, webmd always gives extreme answer don’t face liability.

there study monkeys showed even though didn’t antibodies still reintroduced virus got fever actual indications reinfections. get one? point even care FDA approved not. Yes appear 3rd world country fraction America’s GDP per capita worse America. Except least attempt nationwide federally mandated lockdown lasted 6 weeks, face new outbreaks, regional lockdowns reinstated, mask usage mandated. Plenty mistakes clearly made India come on. want do! Saw something kids sit yards costumes on...it would fun drive around pelt people candy! need positive result get paid so. still worth get tested even results take month. locking UK like happened NZ would disastrous effects economy. London central hub UK, Europe.

Loxking stop incoming travellers effective measure, there's reason epidemiologists recommend it. “Free” meaning cost patient time administrating. Don’t act like countries aren’t stupid shit too

I see European redditors like Poland saying don’t take seriously either. Look Brazil. Even Italy talking reopening schools person found 21,000 cases random sampling alone month. Reportedlyy Germany somewhat immune fake news enormous respect experts. S10+ here, installed ""Pulse Oximeter - Beat &amp; Oxygen"", App, MUCH better reading SP02 HR.  read like Samsung Health does, give updated reading XX time. Maybe haven’t paying attention. ask, won’t believe proof people give you. dont think so. actively initiating policies lead deaths, suffering loss freedom immoral wish would die? obviously doesnt care deaths innocent citizens. always immoral wish death upon someone? Even enormous opportunity highly positive effect greater good humanity? vaccines reach us? I’m hoping August comment sounds like want fuck step sister mad made guy period. I'm kink shame c'mon dude. S20 doesnt sensor anymore. old S9 helpful. us case rest us, assuming minimum 60K per day, surprise 12 days might 4.7M cases, make 5M reachable month Science &amp; reason distrust rushed vaccine. saw happened swine flu vaccine 70s, aware unknown SV40 contamination early polio vaccines. Sorry Walmart needs press charges make examples here. big box stores. going long enough. Sadly removed heart rate now. stress test requires Samsung watch band. live metropolitan area United States, definitely require masks indoors. Rural areas adhere well. However, rural areas protocols metropolitan areas. That's beauty regulating things county county State State basis. federal government ordered sweeping mask mandates, make much sense rural farmers would metropolitan cubicle farmers. knows, honestly? I’m (perhaps foolishly) banking governors administration choice take strict measures reaches certain point.

275,000 guess. Ooh, fantastic! Thanks again! Exactly. Every vaccine I've seen far best booster full dose 28 days first. Unfortunately cant get flu jabs sep-oct. Also Trump: Nobody's ever peaks high. Nobody. three half years president's able I've done. we're coming back we're coming back peak nobody would thought possible. That's great testing, best testing world. test, able show chart. tested half much, numbers would down.  Well 80% cases mild might asymptomatic.... took virus, America destroying Ugh that’s sad. Rest peace. Perhaps. Deleted. whole covid-19 global response overall schadenfreude nothing get punched face covid-19.

January - China gets hit mass covid-19 spread, wuhan locked down. Nearly every country schadenfreude China nothing prepare countries.

March - countries longer laughing. NY/NJ gets hard hit, US states schadenfreude nothing prepare.

June - US states longer laughing. say Sweden better neighbors? anyone say that?

You're mad somebody... me. stop assuming everyone opinion.  People binary either.

I think that's problem. paint every person every issue wide brush. simple.  nice though, would make judging people issues much easier. ""Those learn history doomed repeat it.""

Attention spans small now, need textbook remember 1 week ago. even then, regions read them. ""The payment depends approval theU.S. Food Drug Administration ability successfully manufacture it, Pfizer’s Beatty said. ""

Many people suck. cunt. Oh I'm American... unfortunately without constitutional amendment probably right. gave vaccine thousands people areas large outbreaks, gave control group placebo. they're waiting see many people group get sick going daily lives. Look, seriously think takes test 25 times, eventually say 🙃

Tests work like that. completely missed point. People poverty can't choose relocate like nothing. choice huge chunk population. I'm Trump apologist, least, get little philosophical here...

We can't change past affect today - virtue actions today - tomorrow.

First all,[there 3536 unintentional drowning deaths America every [32,000 motor vehicle crash deaths [144,000+ Americans died covid since order magnitude higher. aside numbers wrong, claiming preventable deaths permissible ""this thing"" deadlier invalid argument begin - even right numbers, which, again, *extremely* not.

Second: direct chance dying risk. also stand good chance injured, possibly permanently. Also, importantly, fuckup propagates disease. infectious disease works one dangerous. 16 people infect people. [California currently r-nought value meaning 16 cases covid-19, average, go create 16 cases covid-19. Hopefully, particular 16 likely not, thanks testing contact tracing.

Third: [Base rate Maybe one's overall percent chance dying due covid high enough care (though maybe care know wrong were), chance dying *given infected* much higher.

New York March April two women street outside window said “it’s nice meet you” kissing cheek Sounds good. Alaska? Texas third largest state. Death rate seem great news deaths absolute terms climbing month well hospitalizations things still pretty bad getting even worse short medium-term. seem true. New York 900 quite awhile, CT 150, NJ around 250. need get lower there's wave going on. least states. low too. fucking cunt Trump is, yea great idea fuck head like people thought wearing masks months ago. Lol, plain surgical masks experimental coating.

These range effective filtration 35-65%.

This deceptive because, unless working hospital covid-19 soaked mask, basically useless. (They also use hospital, N95 wayyy effective).

N95 mask would give actual 95% **filtration** main danger lies inhaling viral particles. Therefore deceptive promote ""99%!!!"". article says, ""Who holding people accountable loss human life?"" asking individuals struggling survive capitalism, asking lawmakers crippled unions US protect corporations workers. 

Countries US beat COVID willing provide REAL sick leave help struggling folks survive despite virus. 

Making choice going work sick thereby losing health insurance ability eat housing, quarantining losing insurance, able make rent, able eat - pit working class one another manner, end disgusting situations like one.

Demand change. Demand protections workers. Lol look cases TX Florida mighty leaders comments inaction past months tell I’m fucking wrong. Oh, it’s patriotic wear mask. Screw republicans. Blood hand. .... peer review prior publication norm, though? We're getting lot reporting preprints right crisis. Based that's going (lots junk science getting reported later retracted), fully expect we'll go back norm over, sooner. point Belgium lot community spread implementing lockdown, leading lot serious cases despite pretty hard lockdown. UK Spain. Germany never getting lot serious cases suggest that, like Norway Iceland instance, community spread still relatively light implemented restrictions. 

I think real question isn’t much lockdown vs. lockdown, rather level restrictions theoretically keep community spread low implemented early enough. experience Sweden shows relatively light restrictions recommendations (no gatherings 50 people, stay home showing symptoms sick pay day one, work home possible etc) actually pretty good lowering R number, implemented community spread far gone. Norway instance might might well able get similar results Swedish style mitigation ended getting lockdown lower level community spread mid-March. AI likely good enough wait anyone next 50 years. advanced think.

It's always possible hold people accountable actions, even wait years.  familiar him, look name ""Simone Wiesenthal"". also see hard maintain quarantine. Mobility Norway Denmark starts going within week Easter it’s Sweden’s even. Finns expert level self isolating. It’s true, they’ve learned.

I'm 23 y/o healthy person two years ago flu spent good week half bed, took least 3 months get back old self. people say ""It's flu"" they're forgetting flu quite nasty indeed looks like people get covid (just like flu) fine, real chance could suffer. unlikely people mild cases see permanent damage part, spent 4 weeks bed thinking year two back 100% far impossible. Park could/should really think housing staff hotels own, feed them, keep families safe possible. almighty dollar. sad scary.  Good!   know, guy asshole. Got America HIV/AIDS epidemic, swine flu, bird flu, mad cow disease, ebola. totally full shit.  fraud Fauci guy is. Trump even calls Dr.Faucet, funny! genius! still fax machines? covid19 renamed 'Trump flu? &lt;3 Canada, response looks like dream compared pile radioactive shit Disunited States.

But might prepared what's come. one vaccines ""real"", things get ugly terms international relations. going play fair. expect US play dirty, esp president party involved. might coherent make sense, it'll dirty guarantee it. bunch politicians join dirtiness secure vaccine. They've shown they'll fuck us US citizens think keeps money/power. They'll fuck Canadians even faster.

As far tell, Canada attempting pre-buy oxford/AstraZenica “It’s entirely clear (vaccines) Canada access to. It’s entirely clear global availability is,” said Bogoch. “Hopefully get hands successful.” fact virus covered fat membrane lol  Nope, still hoax. /s Wow, strong president!   know would great said alongside this?

Give hope please I've lost mine going grocery store seeing people wear masks. this.

Can't comment general fuckupery that's going on, Queensland decided that.

And alone, result good times Australia generally - though we're slipping south moment due complacent. Places like Florida, Georgia, Texas accept consequences stupid fucking politicians people. deserve vaccines, medicines, nothing. Since people voted horrible leaders, let understand choices, need help medicine? Education answer, oh well, late that! Meh. 'known cases' 'worst hit.' Narcissist here.

I've worn gloves medical grade mask every time I've left home since started. assure value beautiful self far much walk around unprotected. Furthermore, look upon anti-maskers utmost disdain; assume (rightly so) they're low-IQ, therefore worthless human beings. 

I assure you, Anti-Maskers narcissists; they're idiots. that's expected successfully flattened curve. I'm suspicious sharp drop shortly white House ordered covid data away CDC agency controlled one closer allies.

Not saying numbers definitely manipulated smells slightly fishy me. That's hiphopanonymous Germs

People know, guy asshole. Got America HIV/AIDS epidemic, swine flu, bird flu, mad cow disease, ebola. totally full shit.

What fraud Fauci guy is. Trump even calls Dr.Faucet, funny! genius! TF Desant-ASS keep lying lying? thought contrast Norway's 47 deaths per million people, Sweden's 559 deaths per million people cannot possibly clearer. Norway pursued conventional strategy whereas Sweden went herd immunity. also recall Denmark, Norway Finland discussion reopening borders Sweden going shut (hardly surprising). aren’t really common they? Everyone know experiencing zero complications. Learning use algebra (even end using job) good learn deal patterns number abstractions.

Some people even said ""why even bother learn arithmetic?"" ever since got calculators several decades ago, come handy basic sanity-check. machines may come answer, us say ""wait minute, seem right"". We’re trying negotiate get away virus? telling us 20 days safe.  paycheck less grocery bill new taxes taken out? Link shit Turning back 1918 reactionary

You mean short-sighted. China 3 Covid Vaccines Stage 3 development, US 0. would China hack US?  reminder unique Japan. Although I've seen story dozen times quarter fax machines used people saying ""Oh Japanese old fashioned.""

**Bottleneck U.S. Coronavirus Response: Fax fax machines Austin labs blamed long wait times coronavirus test places use Fax machines still, rarely stories pick traction.

Only Japanese, reason.  buy new tanks missiles bomb hell coronavirus, work sure. Denial Hasnt CDC pretty much screwing pooch along too, though? Damn... second source I’ve found thread. Crazy times state three months ago told us record, live nebraska go look see few, know thats lie triple number state lie yours. diligent vigilant  even US (thankfully), like hope American's starting get message start responsible things.

I followed bunch links article couldn’t track down. large number studies proved China Europe almost simultaneous outbreaks. neither China Europe origin.

What country epidemic situation serious, tracking, lot people exchanges China Europe?

I think answer simple. Yeah it’s killed Trackers never got data CDC though, get states individually. CDC data usually pretty delayed. CCP free speech 😅

They live make voice heard 🤣 VIEWING EXPERIENCE!!!!!!! going get worse. remember praise Me. Noone could screw well me. Everyone saying it. USA #1 USA #1 Scroll Up. Read Title. Planning Make Public Good. respect Fauci, Im Italian Ive enough. He's bit Narcissistic. claim anyone reliable source? Speak yourself. Lock up, throw away key. articles I've read: exact personality traits (among others) make people likely believe conspiracy theories. really can't imagine worse case exercising gym. long till hit 328.2 Million? Genuine question considering thats estimated number us population.  think mean CDC constantly hamstrung administration we'd better off... called China virus originated from. Maybe stop PC trying get offended everything? Guess understand 'long term effects.' 

I trying keep 9 month (short-term) old daughter potential side effects virus point rest life(long-term).

Unfortunately, one knows whether occur not. interest letting child test subject something could deadly side effects. \*trade vaccines democracy Dude. article written April. Phase 3 occur anywhere close April. article even mention. Phase 3. specifically 1100 people UK. Phase 3 trials way 1100 people them. 

I can’t explain simpler this. literally right article you’re linking. continue think quote phase 3 point going back forth. saw play her.

Lol, can’t believe exists. Next big thing Hamilton! know?  Others stated virus global public good well. still insists taking hydroxychloroquine he's DUBASS Comments locked low-quality off-topic politics. applying race things nothing race fits narrative.

Mortgage rates determined credit score race. Mortgage applications even ask race. 

"" systematically extracted wealth black people centuries.""

Who ""we"" ""we"" done this?

You created system injustice committed people color based racism look facts back up. poor white people country race.

If born poverty matter color skin going harder dig ignore largest segment demographic order fit narrative ....well....racist. Pfizer shown better results peer reviewed research oxford moderna. forget African countries. much better Europe. penetrate border Canada Mexico, disappear.

We tend notice eventually. mind deporting Americans, either. Wow shitty! It’s like everywhere US. live San Jose got tested free pop site. Took 15 min get test got results next day. States/Counties handling well, it’s sad whole country page. Poverty number though. Someone making little money Western European countries comprehensive health care, access higher education, available housing, etc. AZ numbers messed up, gotta look hospital stats declining good amount past couple weeks. Also bars gyms closed weeks, people lot better masks past month too. We're still spraying groceries (while wearing gloves &amp; mask) removing outer packaging whenever possible. Items left sanitizer 24 hours shelved. fridge thing worrisome, spray everything (and mean everything), wash well, fridge it, hope best. I've wondering along: cases 10x high know ... lethality must approx one tenth bad since missing deaths. Doesnt put lethality nearer flu? Still shitty change things tad, no? heard too, still I've found. I'm Seattle get good ole Amazon. nice if, nation, collectively worked together rectify this. much food goes waste, many people need food, impressive technology point. think shit like Amazon Go, could accept EBT everywhere. k NYC LI 25,000+ deaths, area small compared size California.(LA county probably bigger NYC LI combined) 

These confirmed numbers well. 

I'm sorry competition what's going California worse went NY. 

Picture going California state wide cram Los Angeles. 

That's went NY could come easily cheaper mass produced N95 grade mask flood market them. 
Yeah, racing stripes would pretty sweet too. Wondering civil suits stuff start getting filed. Think means covid 19 magic prevents spread summer...

We many people still believing magic(religion) around world.  dont think ever time open places US without vaccine.

Not US. keep rushing open everything up, instead saying ""these things able open"". want plan that, try change models (the top restaurant Toronto currently take-out...), accept that's fact. Indoor dining indoor bars closed next year. combined vaccines tested less thousand people initial comment even clever, needs explanation. one got weirdly aggressive defensive pointed out. That's it. Thanks weird exchange. fantasyland allow be. government already funding significant portion drug development, pharma middle man. Take middle man. things, ones get decide, choose profit humans. NY followed plan cases going poor always fucked law. comment amazingly stupid. Unfortunately given size either diabetes. incredibly sad virus done world. Even age longer protective factor insofar younger populations getting diseases used found advanced ages. US sure around 40% refuse get vaccine something something 7-1 everyone works gets it, turns one going work cuz sick now. awesome foresight entered in, conversation people 49. also mentioned mild cases. stopped wearing mask around people lived with, notifying sick? yeah shame guys still first, end sight. It’s sad essential workers busy tired congregate protest what’s right. personally working like broken mule, accepting future poverty suffering. 

Gotta set bar low days want happy life ten obvious facts say seem smart one forced many kids It'd nuclear projectile poop, eh hope arrested, charged, convicted, put solitary. okay make partisan issue then. Except you’re completely fucking wrong. way could happen [R] state allowed split simultaneously chronic bronchitis, anxiety disorder, claustrophobia. Wearing mask sucks know what, suck wear mask every second I'm outside house car. I've panic attack mask before, left store went car taking off. personal issues deal with, absolutely make okay put people danger.  Yeah lifelong New Yorker don’t think ever fully get rage people current virus hotspots laughed us mocked

You New Yorkers also displayed lot unwarranted racism towards Asian Americans February-March. 17.8% positive 54,961 tests

at top page Military excellence super power country. marine boot camp, plenty people around world trying get green card honored able earn it. Regardless incompetent leader, still think America lot better countries there. Someone saying spent 2 weeks awaiting negative results unpaid, next time get tested, since that's incentive structure perceive. I'm try find comment, inform this. Mask use issue. 

It's never closed (technically, gov't cant declare full closure based post WWII constitution, recommend it). 

The gov't also trying keep economy going made ill fated in-country tourism push. also national social (non-governmental) push residents support bars, restaurants, music venues, etc, hard hit. thought tests margin error though? concede expert field specifically. said, familiar statistics... think *any* assays/tests 100% accurate 0 margin error. seems literally impossible (your example also seems imply bullshit). testing asymptomatic people exposure counterproductive. Every test two metrics -- sensitivity (rate correctly identifying positive) specificity (rate correctly identifying negative). tests 98% 99% sensitive similarly specific. Given specimen actually contains SARS-COV-2, test 99% probability positive. specimen SARS-COV-2 it, that's 99% chance test result negative. Sounds like good test right? 

Now imagine testing 1000 people, neighborhood 5% people COVID. means sample, 50 people true positives, 950 people true negatives. test PCR test that's 98% sensitive 98% specific, end 50*.98= 49 people COVID positive test result, plus one falsely negative person. bad, really. Among truly negative people though, 950*.98 =931 people dont COVID 19 people truly infected received positive test result. 68 people positive test, 72% truly positive. 

Since that's lot money spent test gives false positives 28% time, decide pre-screen population. testing ask people they're symptomatic, they've exposed sick person recently, work high risk setting. eliminates 60% people test population right bat -- testing 50 truly infected people another 350 truly uninfected people. test still identifies 49 50 true positives. 350*.98 = 343 truly negative people negative tests, 7 false positives. Now, 56 positives test gave, 87% truly positive. 

This much better, that's still 7 people inappropriately forced isolation two weeks. prescreening, 7 people quite probably low income essential workers health care works desperately need stay field treat others they're sick. decide confirmatory testing test that's 99.5% sensitive 90% specific. second test catches 49 true positives, correctly identifies 6 seven true negatives such. didnt realize long term side effects tested phase 2. search ""virus less lethal time"" google, general idea deadly virus either mutates strain less lethal version allow survive, die host, problem coronavirus infective enough deadly enough continue like Dr. Fauci did?

It amazes everyone forgets Dr. Fauci telling people ""masks work"" beginning. Belgium already seeing 1k cases per day April 1st. puts Spain/Italy/France boat getting hit hard early time implement lock down.

Meanwhile, UK also completely ineffective response virus. think anyone denying that. Lockdowns alone enough still need competent leadership. 

Unfortunately anti-lockdown crowd, probably stemming fact anti-lockdown incredibly selfish narcissistic stance, lack emotional maturity admit wrong even evidence staring face. daughter's preschool happy change diapers. Well, never claimed prevented transmissioj. ""Freedom Slavery"" - 1984  Germany. Hate break thinking handwave away research development feel like insufficiently tested falling anti-vax rhetoric. went two virtual meetings admins yesterday given basic overview procedures safety protocol person school. adults overwhelmed. kids absolutely traumatized constantly reminded ever present threat tragedy unfolding around them. anti-microbial coating affect virus? odd wording fine article. gym thing point keeping going back depressed. hope cant wait wet university pussys Welcome politics. numbers much like anything else. Humans nothing stats unless top matter. COVID become political either agree everybody else. I'm Massachusetts bad NYC also deal things described. ""asymptomatic"" enter conversation? time vaccine go regular trials becoming worst nightmare. Florida fiancé’s job two days minimum soap, cleaner sanitizer touch-pads, plexi shield.. social distancing enforcement stickers, mask enforcing standards safety.

Last week, two people called “sore throat” one hospitalized chest pain.. job said COVID symptoms would tested... Um, Chest pains sore throats many people’s first symptoms...
This fucking company going kill workers off..

Manager said didn’t need test return, COVID symptoms (sore throats - hospitalized chest pain) world exactly equate symptoms. Nope back work. tests nada Whatever US says - 100% right transparent! fact continued work seems irrelevant infecting housemates tell them.

In fact, hads home day, even likely would infected them. can't put 17 people 1420 square foot home virus spread!

The real issue either quarantine facilities chose use them. pay expedited test here. friend family paid $300 get results within 24-48 hours still took 6 days. there’s vaccine

the good news time there’s vaccine ~30% population developed herd immunity dumb asses we’ll need vaccinate ~40% virus random infections isolated. lead paragraphs:

Means less people died sources overall, means even deathes corona (presumably). Fair enough! That's climate change, Covid. lived NYC thirty two years. Left December 2016.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* True didn’t close borders quick enough, still managed infect entire world. True, went herd immunity downplayed it, instead social distancing, isolation masks Saying 1.72% tested positive meaningless look many people got tested. 370K positive 3.1m tests, 12%. can't scale total population. crap shoot. People get tested feel sick, 12% high? many people mild symptoms, 12% low? way sure test everyone.

 Number cases really matter anyway, want know trying predict happen number hospitalisations number deaths. takes time get sick enough require hospitalisation die, need understand fast virus spreading know much hospital capacity need couple weeks. 

If room, lot people die needlessly. people corona, also people need hospital something else.

So pretty big deal. that's considering hospitalisation death. people long term detiorating health effects can't properly gauge yet. 'fully recovered' might fully recovered, know yet. 

So majority people fine, total amount damage differ wildly depending control spread there's vaccine let spread unchecked. irony is, act like really big deal now, relatively small deal. act like big deal now, huge deal... 16 person household, sounds like someone living poverty. course person went work. choice have?

What nightmare. Protests started 2 months ago spike New York City Minnesota probably largest.

Regardless, still answered question. plan people lost jobs? feel chaotic stupidity maybe stirred deliberately due coming elections. Source. Stonks go up, says man colored like citrus fruit found Florida. (Gonna delete comment automod?)  good thing, difficult moments this. know going get worse. I'm opinion disaster currently unfolding south probably USA's Chernobyl. 

My mother friends say parallels happening country tail end Soviet Union uncanny. 

I young enough relevant memory standing hours bread line grandmother... lot doctors wear masks, pretty normal surgeons wear 10+ hours day perform long surgeries. caused health issues, someone medical degree would noticed long pandemic. worst studies able say masks associated headaches, sympathize with, preliminary report leads decrease O2, without supportive data. say studies suggest mask work fine, say illustrate masks dangerous quite exaggeration. call evil, people know believe anymore. completely understand mistrust government, mislead news sources seem legit. internet dangerous place days, I'm trying come responses bring studies like these. think great able move, want remind 1. Video interviews non-office based work rare pre-COVID, especially minimum wage service industry jobs. 

2. Getting apartment state eviction history (more likely lived poverty many years) poor credit scores almost impossible.

I'm trying create what-if strawman here, I'm relaying hurdles many people know faced trying leave high cost living area. Sure, way? state dictate Devin Nunes' bright red district impose greater restrictions? That’s freaking awesome! wonder many also trying lose weight covid. It’s sure inspiration me! people really wholeheartedly subscribe individualistic, survival-of-the-fittest mentality: like think either lion sheep.  


The irony obvious is, lions wolves predators folks compare live packs support one another. based assuming ~1k American residents die day.

That's current trend all. forecast based linear extrapolation, growth exponential (possibly logistic, significant slowdown infects 30-50% nation).

We even know bad COVID combined flu season. 

Maybe higher fatality rate. first time wish person death cause recovers he's going obnoxious affect US cause dumbasses going use example.  fear mongering guy legend fine Worse anti-science. Three governors Columbia's Amazonas region simply stole money earmarked hospital, leaving folks care. know think him, core? excuse, observation someone also grew narcissistic father, therapy, recognize patterns): insecurity stems horrible (and probably also narcissistic) father’s treatment family. child, zero control probably felt scared. developed coping mechanisms child purely survival, adult morphed need control never kid, insatiable desire loved wanted. It’s sad happens someone, someone elected run country, it’s terrifying. problem vaccine covid covid it, rushed vaccine accidentally releases active virus instead deactivated virus would mess Study body vaccine!!! Ok Al Bundy. many touch downs throw too? Uhhh.. little late jackasses. spring summer. morons stayed home position... Flaws system ourselves. many Americans telling Americans fuck worried this, stupid believing CDC, care get sick wear mask muh freedom. disheartening time American shame felt sure.  don’t care funds come social companies add small top want to.

Companies care probably bit stretch. really depends employee's role. employee key person whose work able quickly retasked temporary replacement otherwise absorbed team, question money. suddenly recruiting training onboarding question. lost time &amp; productivity bring new person speed. difficulty finding qualified person knows job expiration date. Given leanings present government, may ordered enough white people.  also data available us says significant number 97% could facing permanently damage bodies. 

That’s headline good news. It’s trading fewer deaths potentially crippling entire generation. Yes. fired anything religion race gender sexual preference. due virus, due government. ones imposed lockdown, result I'm one people lost jobs it. me, would never one. mom got tested thrice come back positive, symptoms, sick 3 weeks, go ER twice.

  44-year-old disease intervention specialist, lost life spring COVID-19 struck Prince George’s County Health Department Maryland suburbs Washington, D.C. coronavirus infected least 20 department employees, attended staff meeting sat close together, union leaders said.   
  pandemic’s early days, department leaders said, followed countywide policy telework devised 2016, one developed coronavirus threat. time, employees said, department failed provide enough personal protective equipment keep workers encountered safe — agency helping shepherd community worst health crisis century.

  Mack’s requests supported immediate supervisors rejected upper management, according union documents. brother Roland Mack, 38, said can’t understand why, since duties involved mostlypaperwork, computer work phone calls.  
  
Rest peace. Sad story.  
  
My sister make decision quit job March HR wouldn’t let work home even though people infected dying ALF worked at. wasn’t healthcare worker could easily done work home done previously new company took over. wish would known hurricane season coming.  It’s total shock. want even one person Yep cost $2k get ambulance ride hospital half mile house. Fucking ridiculous Why? reason can't bought control. look countries like Vietnam, Taiwan, South Korea - managed totally control much fewer deaths, controlled spread, social programs help people.

The US response pathetic. govt criminal. people stupid, country many idiots deniers.

A vaccine wont magically fix anything. People need learn responsible. Good point would argue approach i'm trying take people legit anxiety able breath mask.

That approach might work children, grown ass adults spend day watching OAN. people beyond help need forced wear mask. amount empathy leveled approaches help them. try find middle ground allow resume life without forcing something legit makes feel like going die

I'm sorry, idiots deal spreading around COVID-19? Seriously, fuck that. monumentally selfish them.

There middle ground this; either wear mask around people don't. refuse, able put low wage employees risk without repercussions. wear face shield alternative.

That already option, choosing ignore it. good news coming Sweden, claimed. seen proof claim Swedish strategy based economy considerations. say none.

But theory. agency runs strategy working public health population level. think look health care perspective problematic. health care professionals every patient important. never weight loss education kids risk Covid-19. excerpt:

Imagine full shit. zero infection, would still cases?

Now you’ve wandered tautology, go away. Add top deemed ""essential"". Working underpaying job includes increased risked personal well being, way unwind social means afterwards.

There's notice health app no, hospitals want higher. hoaxers believe ""that kill makes stronger"". nonsense course, car crash make lose limb, never mind polio victims suffered vaccine.

It’s sacrificing... Chinese border quarantine facilities limits capacity. It’s like welcome everybody flushing once. Californians elected president Republicans, although Reagan born here.  don't, still need doctor admit them, admitted cold. respond personal attacks calling out. No, killed more. Yeah, door weddings spread it, fucking protests. Give fucking break, bullshit helped spread it.

That study flawed fuck obvious biases.

Is healthcare I'm American ever afford? Well there's fundamental difference narcissism sociopathy even though many attributes exist end spectrum both. people's opinions valued narcissist itself, whereas sociopaths really affected others think outside means end. One way look internal vs external validation. It’s that- it’s massive amount heart attacks strokes clots creates well. Mask use almost certainly helps well. Residual side-effects much 6x common. Usually people either die flu (very rarely) fully recover. That's understood. Tough position in; would argue take hard line stance, time parishioners need ever, easy call.

Personally, church handle well front improved went along. I'm still disappointed see people advocating attendance fewer restrictions. I'm also frustrated fact still pushing communal wine distributed spoon (which downright insane given current state affairs). wish focus given truly need most, case also vulnerable population, elderly many cases alone. shut state, there's tax revenue. Meaning state unemployment coffers run everyone state laid burned funds. happens, get riots FEMA camps. tough situation. May 1, Arizona 7,962 cases 1,986 hospitalizations, hospitalization rate 24.9%.

As yesterday, 148,683 cases 6,894 hospitalizations, hospitalization rate 4.6%.

The rate hospitalizations fallen 24.9% 4.6% 81.6%. far 6 times deadlier flu. Everyone's trying hype flu's deadliness make kinda point COVID ignored. flu ain't deadly.

So, inject local's thoughts this...

A month half re-opening, community cases pretty low despite slips, e.g., bunch people celebrating opposition gains following elections, sans masks distancing. Fears new clusters materialise, despite daily lives somewhat back normal (theatres open again). likely thanks masks degree work-from-home. Distancing daily life difficult, thanks density.

The cases foreign workers housed packed dormitories remain uncomfortably high 4 months (considering community cases hovering around 10+ daily). seems like initial drive relocate workers better quarters allow distancing fizzled out, authorities (and locals) come accept slow-burn transmission, since hospitalisation fatality rates low moment, infected folks kept away community =/ I’ll say it’s worthless.

Importance: Rising Covid19 cases US attributed political leaders testing. Positivity-ratios (cases tests ratio) conjunction cases tests provide better overview. However, comprehensive overviews positivity-ratio patterns scarce. 

Objective: examine trends positivity-ratios, tests cases state mid-April-mid-July. Further, examine whether positivity-ratio patters associated state political-affiliations. 

Methods: State-level publicly available data Covid19 used. Seven-day moving averages (MA7) positivity-ratio computed April 21-July 15. States assigned four groups based patterns change positivity-ratio: higher end study period beginning (Group 1), initial decline subsequent increase starting Memorial Day weekend (Group 2), initial decrease upturn last 14 days (Group 3), consistent downward trend (Group 4). Political-affiliation categorized  President Trump state governor Republican. Additionally, proxy measure used indicate intensity Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests state. Associations tested using chi-square analysis. 

Results: Fourteen states Group 1, fifteen states Group 2, fifteen states Group 3, six states DC Group 4. 78.57% Group 1, 33.33% Group 2, 40% group 3, none Group 4 Republican-leaning. difference distribution statistically significant (p&lt;0.01). Distribution high-intensity BLM protests across four groups statistically different 

Conclusion: Increased Covid19 cases cannot attributed testing. Indeed, high positivity-ratios states indicate current testing failing capture actual infection rates. association state political-affiliation positivity-ratios suggests Republican voters may somewhat skeptical gravity disease emphasizes importance messaging political leaders.

Maybe he's lying said? like he's swell guy, anyway. kind policy provoke people attempt weaponize virus. know forced go workplace would find every possible opportunity face face decision makers responsible. Nature gives weapon, choose wield it. sad irony social media allowing us connect people family friends swiftly, also basically helped kill concept helping thy neighbor. hey look, ignorant grunt blind stevie wonder appear mutate nearly often, expend billions dollars trying make vaccine common cold tens hundreds times less deadly. [Dead virus fragments causing COVID-19 reinfection false That's popular equivocation here. point extremes like Stalinist Russia North Korea Venezuela want prove awful socialism is, want call someone socialist, use ""when government stuff"" definition. bunch nutjobs that's gonna hard that's can't trust anyone right thing This.

Hopefully, customers least pay attention signage awkward tell masks recommended, required. Considering they’re even going enforced, could’ve started sooner August 1st though. Wow, move US, got new contender. course get criticized like mericans reddit. Even though there's dozen ways India needs reprimanded. Sweden fine. know wanted piles bodies it’s happening. That's parenthetical  I'm worried lack concern well. also return large aggressive crowds saw store work, grabbing TP, etc, there's nothing left anyone else. Hard social distance crowds like that. People got carried away wrong thing. He's getting he? stop testing, goes away. immediately followed actual quote stating “new hospitalizations flattened decreased slightly.”

So person writing article says “those seeking care decreased drastically” health official interviewed said “those seeking care flattened decreased slightly.”

Which one it? trust person working Advent Health trust person writing article says something justifiable numbers back up?  definitely picked wrong painting cover image, much better work found inside article.  Oh btw I'm speaking generally specific company, sorry lol would better current inhabitant supported masks start followed science. masks painted unnecessary thing, recommended worn visible people government, maybe many people refusing wear them. course would still some. Instead many high visibility appearances masks, recommended/required, blaming countries, specific pushback mask requirements state level, public shaming name calling officials. even masks made required national level feel like many people bought ""no mask"" rhetoric. would better nothing though. agree, combination perfect storm lots people winter holiday turned highly infected areas Italy followed carnaval celebrations also underestimation RIVM first crucial weeks. remember reading interview one first confirmed patients stayed home sick week told could leave house symptom free 24 hours happy go cafe drink beers, that’s really felt screwed. yea lol hella pissed.

maybe werent busy trying make fun shitting mainland folks... see vaccinated folks exposed virus getting not? periodically testing covid?  WATER ISNT WET! - Brought Trump administration ""nothing bad happening look here"" committee don’t know even possible normal, functioning, non-deficient adults tap rudimentary mindset Steven grade dipshit. Death part severity equation. heart lung damage still concerning.  appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Came day this.

Basically took least severely quelled versus kind waiting shoe drop. read article first impression trying lenient “medical exemptions” masks seeing she’s even inconsistent description handling it. it’s pull mask breathe empty aisle, would anyone else need socially distance them? grocery store probably strict provide safe place immunocompromised people shop. taking first half sentence forming response

Oh, that's right, totally made up!!! population 3.5 million ... disrespect Ned's dad, situation like ""We half-heartedly listened scientists although want to, half-heartedly made mild suggestions citizens failed mandate anything enforce did, stoked scrutiny science, said nothing deter crazy people foaming mouth masks, followed demands business interests instead. Please spend money die.""  Keep spreading 'rona, fool. course, France, Italy, Spain, UK, Belgium, Netherlands, terrible job. terrible job part world? Portugal. Thanks this. I've making soapy water soak sounds much easier! so? Point site tracked reported. mean yeah agree lot times reason anything done pr reason. ""This really big deal people think let's put show"".

Pr even reasons keep employees healthy like said, many believe big deal (except reasons *facepalm*) read conditional probability.  Yeah, specifically left part don’t feel like arguing today. don’t good information many people coming rotator cuff surgery, example, test positive Covid hospital. countless anecdotal reports happening.  said **he would call nationwide shutdown, saying would** “completely unsustainable, produce debilitating economic fallback **lead catastrophic public health consequences.**

How exactly? compared going now? Good thank you.  question care chump doesnt want vaccine? rest us right?

I know there's issue stopping older/sick people getting vaccine, think they've included rest far. Oh definitely agreement. need apologise. Americans hire work bar bouncers stand front doors grocery stores 1 3 American dumb fuck! Detroit boom bust kind city. point lot city sat vacant aforementioned reason. That’s one reasons lot people think city “shithole” seems dilapidated, know, despite fighting racism, poverty, redlining, etc.

We also endless corruption deal with, special shout Dan Gilbert, Illitch family, Matty Moroun. We’ve months build capacity trump squandered time— They’ve found asymptomatic cases damage still occurs can’t tell virus induces analgesia (the fancy word pain relief). virus wreaking havoc within body don’t know get X-rays done. Doctors say inside lungs many covid patients looks similar lungs people escaped serious fires - lung tissue almost looks burned.

Feeling good guarantee health. Asymptomatic disease still damage, even can’t feel Yeah influenza testing super common US. Punch tiny hole paper bag got wrap groceries. Tiny enough break open right open car trunk. True. However, situation dire headline suggests.

For example, Bubonic plague still exists. still deadly, *far* less threatening because:

1. cure exists.
2. Modern hygiene.
3. animals current disease vectors come physical contact humans often.
4. people natural resistance disease since they're decedents plague survivors. google ""hospital reason hospitals giving layoffs financial losses. layoffs started weeks pandemic even losses.

Our neighbors two doors surgeon nurse. say 4-6 weeks almost work people either postponed voluntary visits afraid go hospital might actually catch virus there. ironically many parts hospital besides Covid ward underutilized. Bullshit. dems manage steal election Corona fade away. trump wins could seeing another 4 years covid

You think entire world, grip dealing pandemic, local parochial political obsessions. obviously completely wrong that. fine spat car, even spat car, tell wouldnt worth time call 911 lmao. 

But hey, call 911 right. joe biden defunds police kinda like IHME coronavirus models.

""By early August, state 3 156 deaths per day.""

Gee, thanks. 400 partygoers. Drone camera footage. way contact trace. 1% *all Americans* coronavirus. That’s pretty shocking.  Unless roommate covid. what’s happening right now... irony fantastic.

You need take advice look seven day moving average (the forest) instead daily numbers dude (the trees)

You really dysfunctional, right? trolling? one exactly, perfectly wrong many times row.  even bother that? Find place virus spreading, say attack. could pretty much throw dart map Florida, Texas, Arizona find suitable place. biggest problem. rampant misappropriation taxpayer money U.S. government would exacerbate that. Perhaps show working 5,646  think throwing money institution loses trillion dollars good idea either, fair. ... that’s south exploding cases. winter, see flip flop north stay cold keep windows closed. hunch. one tell odds. masks required high density area probably reasonably safe. careful around coworkers, lots workplace transmissions. safe don’t worry specific odds contracting it’s impossible tell unless gave lot information, even it’s guess. Take every precaution move on. wore photo op. wont even wear telling people wear it. usa spike cases. still call victory.  Maybe time Fauci breafings! That's debatable instead giving rich people money use coronavirus ran characters tweet. actually “your favorite currently elected President United States, option”. New branch military: 
C.R.A.P.T.
COVID Response Prevention Team feel like I've already explained this. Florida released daily number CURRENTLY hospitalized covid patients. always released daily NEW hospitalizations covid patients. Brazilian? Thank much thoughtful reply! I'll add super long response email surely read. Polls literally never achieved herd immunity virus without vaccine.

I replying specifically claim true. spread measles slowed dramatically people immune. phenomenon called Herd Immunity. Oh. bad eh. Mention moight toss maple bucks Trudeau worst happen. Holy shit... Americans pay get tested?? even occur me. starters, Mona Lisa never shit she’s holding picture... /s Oh. bad eh. Mention moight toss maple bucks Trudeau worst happen. savage burn! mean England gave U.S fight French? know right? English retreat firepower absolutely butt fuck colonies, attacked home French sizeable navy send boats home defend shores. 

Of course, take word someone absolutely cannot stand English gospel, google it.  pray daily lives lost,nice see compassion around world,as become numb numbers. wish limited Trump die-hards... went gay bar couple nights ago literally packed full people wearing masks, hugging dancing.  actual message trying share. say Obama sucks negotiation? never said emergency bad situation. I'm looking numbers I'm saying look bad lot people saying is. I'm argue, I'm listen. good nature ask if/why I'm wrong. So, would care enlighten bit means snarky analogy toaster fire? Americans invested truly daft? truly believe military answer questions? Race - military, protestor - military, war - military even Covid-19 - military? Really? magic word every crisis including pandemic? like circus managing pandemic thus far. results think alleviate aside deaths civilians, healthcare workers, essential workers military? Let guess - entitled privileged folks? seems like lives becomes meaningless mocked point death count rate infection rate highest world; yet even right BLM profess ALM troll rub salt sneer actually matters. part life matter 13k lives dead 3 millions infected growing more? much choice. many counties openly defying orders. dead cat bounce said took three months gradually drop recent minimum?

That dead cat bounce works dude.

You head sad. combo Fox, right wing radio talk jocks, social media echo chambers. need bring back evening news Walter Cronkite. probably going two wave create Tsunami Death. support family. support me. wear mask since became thing do. don’t support either candidates. support radical change society works can’t even get people wear mask don’t spread disease! Why? Well, blatant lies person position save us scary, unknown pathogen help. constantly divided institutions lead us case, save us. Fauci made pragmatic decision led people wearing masks. proven man use lies advantage. lie next? damaging be? measure past lies seen current rate cases befallen America. Fuck good night. approaching this, I’ve tried stick statistics published papers; however, I’m choosing footnote everything isn’t doctoral thesis. 

'this doctoral thesis' translates to: 'i'm pulling (mis)information ass provide source even wanted to'. enough stop reading entirely, knew nothing factual would follow. Covid cage match. ""We really mess up,"" says man really mess up. gives hope vaccine comes out, even decent chunk people refuse get it, able control virus effectively. sir, bigot

Nah. like nazis either. like wahabist Muslims either. people like Mittens speaking Trump *now* people enabled ilk. culmination party's policies since Goldwater 64. come trying give bullshit higher moral plane.

#You enabled this.

The thing interested ilk admit wrong, work asses get Trump office, *admit fault never get involved politics again*.

Otherwise, fuck right off. 10% military budget?! So... $354,847,836,027,647,748?! read second sentence, important contextualize ""unlikely"" means context. whole community becomes protected. likely protected. probably protected. Protected.  Canadian Trumpster, even better. He's getting something it, maybe votes, maybe money.

It's 40 flip 40 flop, since going cause flap, I'd say another 40. flat 40-40-40 flip-flop flap fee. Wtf mean one associated China? came China. Everybody talking Wuhan China pandemic started. wearing mask simple thing. put mask on. process. take mask. Put face. Stretch pinch across nose. Max 10 seconds do. simple. really means.

There couple implications:

\-A person infected bring home, infecting others household. (This consistent fact length contact proximity increase odds infection.) Groups people add risk spread.

\-It often difficult use contact tracing determine exact source infection

If Socialbutterfly Sally gets infected brings home virus grandpa Homebody Harry, pretty easy figure Harry became ill difficult identify exactly Sally got it. may able use contact tracing find infected people Sally's universe, know one source exactly many became infected. going see HUGE decline seasonal flu year. would like rough timeline. vaccine made one step. Publishing study results regulatory review another step. Assuming it’s approved (which interesting country probably process standards), there’s logistics making kits distribution, etc. time may vaccines going process. It’s complicated, it’s unprecedented scale. Hard imagine it’s going go smoothly despite best efforts. Something something bootstraps true, peoples eras bad side certainly well. would also point though generation integrated military, finally garnered enough support civil rights &amp; voting rights acts made large chunk congress senate passed laws.

Of course racist, moreso average generation today, collective leap generation made racial attitudes &amp; injustices entering adulthood retirement age biggest one generation American history.

Fairly judging era grew in, Greatest Generation incredibly progressive. comparison children (Boomers) proved regressive generation ever. Well, lot 40 million “first wave” north east west. New York City didn’t quite collapse, came pretty close. cases south probably occurred last couple weeks (yay exponential growth), they’re hitting hospitals next couple weeks. Meanwhile, none southern states locking down, cases (and hospitalizations) likely keep shooting up. wouldn’t surprised see hospitals overrun FL, AZ TX week. I've sent pictures :/ never said thought ever good country, replying someone seemed to, showing everything we've done wrong.

So again, everything wrong, become rich/powerful/culturally care change live dumpster fire. People dying needlessly, people, friends, neighbors, family.

Why work instead get people country tried word last sentence carefully, see could interpreted way. said ""Let's work make thought along"" meant portray ""let's work make great believed is""

Right, different idea great is. think involves healthcare. think involves businesses. want progress, everything need really one worlds greatest countries. need change system mindset.

So I. want faster cars, taller skyscrapers, bigger houses, better movies, new inventions. that's progress. Olympics still held possible, allow spectators.

It ideal athletes able compete anyway, legitimately could chance get compete best  FYI: everyone narcissistic traits, mean everyone malignant personality disorder defined DSM.

Trump wears mask (currently) definitely NPD. metric moot. 

NPD show presentation tell anti-masker he/she wear mask ...and person might perform anti-social behaviors told such.  number reasons main one - he’s cunt. Time normalize fucking weird adult obsession Disney clearly irony. Especially since we're Canadian! care provide example outright lied? Well seeing biggest risk wearing mask look dumb, id say cost benefit ratio quite favor wearing masks. major risk mean, awfully hard determine worse school viral spread...

Regardless, agree schools provide lots services. Maybe time re-examine model. Schools able focus making learned, productive, successful members society, focus replacing parents... don't. 29% voters get shit done government. Even counted 27% fence talking weak bill congress. get top level majority support.

Personally, I'd love it. government sucks make compromises top level babies. re-structure budget would line lobbyists pockets. Get new administration maybe we'll see budget changes, next 4-12 years.   thread end right comment. need say anything else. Dude many alts make talk defending known open pedophile? grand papi ate beans saved life, try new Trump Beans, White Mexico, they’re best. 

Covfefe Trump, Sure, what’s important severe disease/hospitalization/death rate. lot school districts making masks optional. along unable socially distance properly.  belongs CCP people said virus came US. Thank you, google practicing hedgewitch. 

Will come gather r/WitchesVsPatriarchy? mean that’s technically correct  Yup, currently explaining away Trump's well wishes pedo buddy's girl arrested 7-D chess. large number studies proved China Europe almost simultaneous outbreaks. neither China Europe origin.

Yes, takes weeks travel China Europe. * rolls eye * Herd immunity collection individual immunities. would depend risks rewards consider calculations, right? friend showed photo said ""Here's picture younger"". Every picture younger. Wonder like living country thinking ultimate global hegemon? Guess takes trailer stand trees suddenly oppressed person planet, regardless fact 20 firearms best buddy sits local board KKK you. Well think way.. 40 years could another 140 million people living right now. Aka roughly 1/3rd current regularly disparage people claim cases testing more. situations partial truth hides deeper meaning. However, case think truth it: CA good catching cases NYC/NY cases beginning adequate testing NY significantly undercounted cases. Excess deaths normalised per population would probably equal comparison. CA bad NY yet, increasing rapid rate. Name one. say get upvoted, essentially Bernie's version medicare-for-all healthcare industry, 4-5 times larger military, cuts would likely go deeper 10%.

Glad ideological battle, realistically path universal healthcare smoother public option intermediate step. might even get us near 100% insured faster subsidies high enough.

Basically nothing size done overnight without enormous disruption, seriously harmful. think lot people thread confusing personality disorder (NPD) trait. Everyone narcissistic traits everyone full blown personality disorder. 

The personality disorder closely linked anti-social behavior...which there's strong argument made anti-maskers have. Everything bigger Texas! article says .6% infections detected found severe. align .28% NYC whole dead? would assume every severe case died almost 50% population whole infected. Trump cares himself. much clear since day one Whoops back magic 2 million prediction everyone laughed back March. vaccine come reach tenth that. don’t think so. many subjects Democrats voted would best country. I’m trying demonise make people forget filibuster Republicans purposely blocking legislation. I’m trying put perspective. point last week hot 700 seeing steadily drop nice, even high number. Though think confirmed plausible, taking plausible takes number Note: According Worldometer, 50 states Washington D.C. reported numbers today.

Fortunately, deaths reported Connecticut, Nebraska, South Dakota, Alaska, Hawaii, Vermont today.

Also, please keep mind that, according Worldometer, 1,002 deaths reported July 15 (thank u/merlin401 catching this). But, according New York Times, Washington Post, BNO News, Reuters, U.S. announced 1,000 coronavirus deaths today since early June. guy poster boy able admit messed up. Looks like he's trying redefine goal getting half-decent outcome slowing spread now.

No one's terribly surprised slowing. Heck, might even noticeable immunity effect even infected are, though I'm skeptical. problem immunity largely irrelevant competent handling, since disease suppressed, everyone who's paying attention e.g. South Korea known since least April. seemed highly likely already March, [the Norwegians picked criticized two people liquor store, two people convenience store, two employees violating mask order, realized hope lost  “We feel bad caused *little outbreak*.”

Seems dumbass doesn’t understand infections work. There’s nothing little spreads exponentially. I'd surprised lot schools go back least hotspots. SC school districts already saying ignore governor wanting schools open. Oh excuses. Couldn’t hold puny little colony le French coming.

May relevant France **was United States’ first major ally openly supported England**. act like it’s shit happened America got lucky. No, don’t firepower buttfuck someone ally, stay buttfucking business. know two people AZ fully recovered even got positive test back. mostly asymptomatic amyway, joke. Well first find effective vaccine gobbling juicy profits. Good luck that. Venezuela surely is, like everyone else South America minus healthcare system.

Venezuela however semi-closed dictatorship lies everything, they'll never admit it.  Thank clarification. would make perfect sense, factors consider. 1. ny outbreak sickest could get tested case numbers super underreported. California anyone wants test easily get one. symptoms got one last week Los Angeles results two days, 2. Better treatments lead less deaths hospitalized, we’ve time learn treat sick 3. virus rampaging it’s way many nursing homes ny going cause many deaths general population, haven’t seen type impact nursing homes California, hopefully stay safe.

So may active cases, there’s story don’t think reach level death ny. point anything possible. I’ll looking closely things go hoping best (while prepared worst) another ten universal healthcare another ten free college everybody. wonder many mooches one last. Ya going cost landlords operators pretty penny. That's certain. Shit, maybe start wearing gas mask 40mm filters.  He's scared mind. Maybe job sit fat ass play around precious phone doctors can't always shit plus worry repercussions employer speaking losing job. water wet  Americans wouldn't.  I’ll pay get out...taxes, donations Biden, whatever feel disgusted Sheriff Lamb got ""clean bill health"" back minute now, we'll 15 cases, right? /s  would happen Edward Snowden returned United States? round Reddit it’s prepared fight get actual virus? replying comment Oxford’s vaccine percentage probably lower Reddit. That's said. Given there's confirmed reinfections, would difficult tell Sure flattened along wrong axis Sure, call wave 1 wave 2 almost states saw decline hospitalizations April/may increases many states increased that. Also nationally two distinct growth phases. Semantics though, doesn’t really matter call it. still gonna transmit place older people. Raytheon lobbyist Senator, “that’s real nice freedoms America right now. would real shame something happen them. real shame.” was. piece shit wearing mask problem here. ""past"" speak of? dont know getting downvoted lol. original artist based design cow. Sweden super well. daily deaths curve dropped much *on without lockdown*. That’s huge! It’s great evidence maybe don’t shut society thing peter erased history medical journals? Got it...🤣🤣 Good .002% die much like common cold. Yeah top this, booster shots required (which, way COVID-19 immunity shaping seems likely), immunity gained previous adenovirus infection (including initial vaccine shot) could interfere booster. Nuke it, uncle John Trump professor nuclear MIT, tremendous school, smart thing nuclear kills everything, could get everyone Rona stadium drop small nuke, big enough kill Rona small enough people die, maybe lose hair, seen hair? best, like mother father.... go Walmart day... Half people masks noses. omg i’m excited google right idea also take 10% military budget give NASA? First nuke hurricane, shoot virus Hmm, speaking Stitt, wonder happened AZ sheriff.... bit extreme tastes delivery, journalists get fired actually lie, so, believe reporting reinfection wasn’t thing Yeah, hear people saying ""we try"" like...um...it's like make soccer team pass math test, ""doesn't work"" people get sick, die. may permanently damaged health-wise. question ""let's try see goes""!!!! prolonged raging national outbreak going far damaging economy short lockdown would been.

We could safely opened schools fall, along businesses, narcissists hadn’t spent months refusing wear masks. Mmm mmm seems good understand anything abstract It’s scary knowing family members think it’s hoax, sit quietly know argument would ensue Ah, you’re fucking idiot well...didn’t attend fifth grade history understand difference fascism, capitalism, communism?  quiet youngling, you’re making loads sense!

There internal logic. whole thing paint numbers completed blind bottlenose dolphin jerked underage Russian spyhooker. get ass November. not, think we'll survive country another 4 years. Exactly. worked DOD contractor, short internship college. people company making 100-200K engineers. bad gig all. paid 10K summer. made massive report DOD. Tons code, actual results technology working on. end got paid crazy amount work asked boss they'd ever use come back looking technical help implementing it. reply, ""Honestly even know they'll look it. I've heard back 1 2 contracts I've 5 years.""

If stop funding things company goes 500 people lose jobs. growing growing growing, can't cut once, recognize bloat see trim fat. people could applying skills problems education, public housing, infrastructure, etc... CDC. 

Who state. 

Who governor admitted isn't' giving CDC anyone else.

Here's Florida givin:g overall hospitalizations, every type malady. That's it. Damn that’s lot Idaho. Wait...that sounds kind like caused pandemic, CFP sacrificed public health reputation. Operation COVID-19 Freedom ^agreed Dang pretty close control covid, data would going back daily briefings. 5G tower Well put way Yeah, virus 0.5-1% mortality rate def kill 100% population 4 months... India also almost faster growth rate brazil Texas extra unemployment week. Trump's idiot. use example fiscal sanity. China comes guns instead virus Explaining came one thing, calling ""Chinese virus"" another. meant brushing off. simple sends good message Trump's like nope, fuck that, it'll send bad message people. article mention antifa BLM. mention Coronavirus. Looks like liar read article all. beach town. link bring Dr. Fauci story. likely answer Hint: reason politician anything banned alcohol movement ban automobiles 1950’s. seen that?  Trump right thing, options either failed illegal.

Take Winston Churchill.

""Winston Churchill famously observed Americans always right thing, tried everything else."" [And data says deaths rest world: wow military went 730billion funding 660 billion. *only* funded 400 billion nearest competitor. excellent time attack, alliance next 9 military budgets needed reach parity rather 12. foolish Americans let open obvious shift power. could dumb Americans think silly virus already killed Americans military conflict since almost beginning Vietnam war worth trying fight. FINALLYYY let's put fires starting somewhere else UK universities already seeing massive economic hits *was* open idea reopening school. COVID-19 pretty low risk students--to point think pretty strong argument harm taking school larger COVID-19 risk them.

Then CDC released guidelines Republicans essentially said *too hard*.  Many conservatives suggested high risk teachers suck quit/be fired. brother-in-laws school decided mandate masks ""too political.""

Then realized even way keep teachers safe (and think possible one does), there's ZERO chance actually going it.

So schools stay shut down, bummer.  both. vote 90% military's budget True. mean, cowardly tactics work getting job done safely, can't blame them.

Honor ever done anything anyone. Mother nature cruel fuck shocked!!!  $100,000 student loan debt? realize would make republicans trust media less, right? absolutely right garbage, want Trump office, republicans continue draw people saying media corrupt even air 'science' bullshit like Could be. guess see assuming outright immunity concept viral dose variable overcome imperfect immunity. personal feeling situation seem change worse high number infections time. almost like becomes super exponential point. Yeah polling numbers lower whale shit bottom ocean. called free falling! Wee!!!!! People care *THEY* affected it. lose parent, spouse, sibling, friend kid, real. happens, able shut up. think best chance avoid said parent let chips fall may.

Make sure inform happy visit hospital deathbed wear mask. donate portion inheritance Biden’s campaign. 

If last part doesn’t encourage mask team, don’t know will. Trump problem, he's symptom problem. problem rampant intolerance anti-intellectualism among disturbing percentage population. Lana. Lana. LANA! LANAAAAAA!!!!!!!! Still, cool. Everything ok though, Orangeade said so.  That's fucking crazy 😓🙏 see familiar “assrape” standards. Appreciate detailed post. issue meets eye, certainly nuanced “air conditioning bad COVID airborne”. apparently given test turned negative. doc told fine, went home, boom ventilator. 

We need work false negatives. Wrong. Bad bot believe increase slowed testing bit last days. Well, GREAT BRITAIN war, fair cut Northern Irish out.  successfully defended invasion Falklands without committing war crimes, islanders stated intention remain British rule conflict. That's pretty concise victory.

Before that, played great role victories world wars, particularly battle Somme.

Before Boer war, Inkerman, Waterloo, Salamanca, Blenheim.

We keep going back U.S even existed want, really point mostly England opposed Britain whole.  Yep, studies shown people narcissism psychological problems less likely wear masks. Younger population less incidence obesity compared western countries? Well, Trump decided jump wearing masks bandwagon. Tell that? Love even seem get irony Yup. friend went Florida two young children within two days back covid. youngest husband hospital. Facts opinions vastly different. ""thought"" opinion. months screaming LIBERATE! states right thing telling lie lie masks everything else virus.

Does think deserves medal big business finally got need wear masks? doubt CCP wrote Looks like depends source.

I've using interesting close get right number fronts still far off.  tried figuring data coming from. says Johns Hopkins. followed there, said hospitalization data CDC. say states. then...I can't find Florida's state COVID-19 hospitalization data. governor admitted give it. article article says give it. 

Can explain? translator said "" literally think constituents want.""

I provided clear evidence care less constituents want. push needlessly kill children happens coincide views majority population (which I'm skeptical case) pure coincidence. Yea even close, herd immunity implies herd protected. Hence name, people immune, vaccinated ones can't vaccinated due age/risk factors protected herd general immune. 

We idea long immunity lasts Rona, pushing non peer reviewed speculation peices one favors. anything opposite idiots think everything ok.

We're immune yay. NYstrong 💪💪😍 clearly ignore daily reminders humans pretty shitty “Covid-19 Recovery Consulting” 

Saw opportunity jumped, didn’t they! one better success chance ChAdOx1 (the Oxford vaccine) well Ad5-nCoV (the CanSino vaccine).

This two vaccines recombinant adenovirus vector vaccine (hence ""Ad"" part names). problem using vector target population encountered vector virus might immunity it, immunity would degrade immune response vaccine too. adenovirus quite common virus among humans.

This vaccine inactivated virus vaccine. taking actual SARS-CoV-2 virus, killing injecting husks people. 30,000 US starting August well What’s “gallivanting” brouhaha? hope wasn’t willy-nilly, gallivanting.

Jesus. like talking brick wall.

I'm done trying teach compassion sociopath. know explain caring people important. guess mom teach basic common decency people never develop it.

Enjoy murdering people want party. Nope. exactly. ask? Say outloud try lol Some...  He’s good guy. Vice President eight years. He’s unknown. bubbles include two persons safe. thing bursting bubble occur one members contact outside. (similar nursing home deaths--they start community, nursing home itself) people educated won’t go status quo. don’t want happen. will, many hospitals capacity personal anecdote regarding prevention: used install security systems living. Clients would occasionally complain since cameras alarms installed, burglarized, therefore could gotten away purchasing installation.

People often fail appreciate much prevention helped them, much would regretted taking things casually acted. It’s infuriating. Part reason wear mask create culture wearing masks. everyone wears mask, everyone protected better wearing N95 mask. That’s best protection get easily. It’s infuriating people don’t seem get it. everyone wears mask, everyone protected, therefore it’s best interest wore mask encouraged everyone around wear masks. 

The preprint March far remember.  Guys stand ladies sit edge boat let ittttt goooooooo. two different things. People need wake realize fricked years ago instead defensive pretending we're still great, start trying make thought along.

So, US ever good country? never, A) become superpower B) care stays is? one point, virtues we've lost? kinda vote recruit guy say ""FUCKING EMBARRASSING"" Letterkenny say everytime govt something Losing polls drives 99% decisions... cares one Yup. I’m pregnant terrified teach 300 kids normally per week schools. HR said work kids resign/take year unpaid, can’t do. .6% probability .6 meaning 60%. model based finding 60% severe cases agree. Although definition phenomenon stated differently governor. case. much knows. Yeah, tends happen absolutely nothing stop something happening. Conservatives raised sacrifice elderly, apparently. dont go see happening then. would surprised 10% people US get vaccine end year. mean every 100 people see, potentially one infected?

Yes that's exactly means, reality depends are. Vermont lower number cases percent population, might see 1 500 infected average. Compare Arizona, would closer 1 50 people average. Oh, agree you. give 1 week base flip-flops, projects. Soon fault directly many died, poor trump tried everything could save us beginning. Disagree this. don’t think you’ve really got much else GOP highlights. he’s 15 points Biden Plenty medical reports observations confirming lasting effects.

Since enough time establish long term effects, take risk?

If flashlight burns exploring cave, say fuck keep going deeper? stop unknown situations dangerous? someone lost money Fauci announced streamlining production, confirm. No, Patrick. Obviously would silly, they're already task force they'd know stuff already!  hes losing points polls. Poli-sci good idea!  encourage dabble economics sociology well!  (My bias towards sociology, think good experience econ).  stuff learn classes like (or even good survey literature topics outside college... can't afford want attend college) seriously improve ability navigate intellectually world.

I think one big things constantly make use triangulation.  words, one source skewed however many ways.  comparing contrasting variety sources personal experience knowledge, decent sense true right.

But also, great constantly critical read grain.  exhausting, sure, must critical.  Critical leaders, critical thinkers, critical media, etc.  

College wonderful environment develop critical capacity well body experience knowledge use savvy consumer media, intelligent voter.  Hope good experience all! Yeah, would optimal scenario. goes history first one make it. still wave 1; never ended.... national coordinated effort masking shelter place orders, postponed states spike cases little while. saw US' wave 1 peak; peak several states (namely NY).

If anything - people’s actions pandemic furthered proven correct. bad! want ride rides! literally nothing stopping spread virus, protecting Americans (Otherwise would done @ day #1). salvaging reelection. already showing 1100 deaths US today.

Not sure last time while. takes 1-2 weeks get back test results, means someone could get infected time he/she took test, gotten back results. makes sense accept negative covid test result taken person already airport. latest US covid tests return result minutes. airports using. ""So long, thanks tax breaks."" Lot's people cramped conditions along spreading 20% (not believe it) reached. There's magic number apply scenarios. Bay County. It’s panhandle.

US military arguably strongest world, doesn’t need it? 1/3 annual government spending? amount weapons actually carry limited arms reduction treaties small number compared many physically bring bear.

Considering talking .5 megaton nukes though, still large amount deterrent force. It’s crisis actors, it’s obvious playing virus political gains.

“We can’t debates! There’s pandemic!” (Even though done virtually). “We can’t vote like usual, let’s use really flawed system mail instead!”

140k people die (which double record flu season), let’s 30 million+ Americans unemployed force small business close! Great plan ruin country even more.

And say “economy people,” **the economy people.** life got destroyed, poor lady.  like measles died out? Unless it’s dangerous population low median age. Even US, fatality rate doesn’t go 0.5% you’re retirement age. ever wonder old people get frustrated wound politics?

You never stop learning new ways shitty Well doubling every 40 days so. Let's back-of-the-envelope calculations.

oct 10 : 16 million 
nov 20 : 32 million 
dec 30 : 64 million 
feb 10: 128 million 
mar 20: 256 million 
april 30: 512 million 


So assuming US continues **fail completely mitigation whatsoever** (which even skeptical, doubt - even cheap-ass masks would prevent this), every single American COVID April Fool's Day. Fitting.

**With every single American getting it, could estimate anywhere 3-15 million dead** (1-5% mortality rate - rather conservative here), assuming mitigations. go timeline, hospitals overwhelmed nationwide sometime fall (mid-October?) causes death rate increase massively. 

If hospitals full, every person would need ventilator can't get one dead. Every person needs ICU can't get probably dead. People need regular hospital beds can't get die much higher rates.

**tl;dr:** Cult45 get heads leader's asshole, we're extra-mega-fucked-plus-ultra. much winning cant take anymore winning long US also buy stuff actually eat resupply throughout year FIFO stock management. large portion America Limbaughtomized. get number?  work this...

You read right, mis-typed.

Herd immunity real epidemics naturally conclude; vital part understanding epidemics century now. wanna talk eradication, talk that, rude people thread spouting misinformation herd immunity actually is.

We *could* achieve herd immunity coronavirus ran rampant population, would drastically reduce number cases end current epidemic (not good solution). However, would eradicate disease would continue cycle lower level populations remain vulnerable, would likely spark new epidemics immunity lost (if immunity lifelong) enough unexposed people join population (by birth immigration). Think like wildfire -- fire burns area, catch fire time even there's still fuel (in case, non-immune people) left, removal burnable material means fire can't spread. time fuel regrows area burn again.

I know gruff I'm simply explaining herd immunity is? I'm claiming viable strategy eradicate disease. likelihood, eradicate COVID-19 even vaccine (after all, we've managed one disease that's smallpox particularly easy identify vaccinate for, lifelong immunity asymptomatic carriers).

Please comprehend comment replying.  would seem Americans want reinvest tax dollars almost anything else war.

Avoid touching face. stuff seems obvious, it’s easy get complacent tired overwhelmed. You’ll best can, masks + proper hand sanitizing take long way. Quote: “You could tested positive February, symptoms, hit bus July you’d recorded Covid death.” BINGO!   that's yes. would indeed like suspend freedom disagree. suspend ability question extremely popular heavily-marketed narrative asked swallow.

For good, course.

Well look you. Oh no, company named greek mythological warriors. South American river. never done social distancing, mask wearing, seeing hand sanitizer/cleaning products flying shelves normal flu seasons.

We normally close entire gig economy enforce small businesses close every flu season? normally deny flights coming various major countries regular basis?

I merely pointed lie - deaths trending downwards. truth trending downwards. Now, trending upwards. sure, point future going go again, going *this point time. going up.* Therefore, point time, flattening curve anymore. five times deaths similar,neighboring countries.

One guess ignoring role contact tracing yo-yo'ing social distancing, difficult model SIR. Typically make everything geometric models, either everyone quickly infected virus dies out.

It's easy guess, though, IFR much lower March reason. Perhaps sun gives us Vitamin reduces mortality 90%. Perhaps young people catching higher rate before. Perhaps mortality hospitals improved factor two. Perhaps viral load plays role, places really hard-hit get higher mortality. evidence things, hope.

The optimistic take cases peaking Florida hopefully hospitalizations follow week two. still early say definitively. dad died non-coronavirus causes late April. long time coming, still far early absolutely devastating. can’t imagine would feel happened couple weeks. spend lot time thinking hundreds thousands devastated families across world. 

I hope people find way feel pain sadness coming forth world right without lose someone close them. 

I can’t imagine must like time. never thought sirens. plenty well spoken climate change activists also knowledgeable informative. Greta one gets attention though seeing little girl speak dramatically future resonates people emotionally boring adult discussing nuances around what’s causing climate change feasibly stopped. issue supporters gains won’t understand issue they’re passionate about. discussion strayed far inherently scientific problem. focus identity substance big part get many “environmentalists” largest opposition nuclear power example. em-mother-fucking-barrassing? refuse work sick trying protect families.  think means deaths//day US agree except forget long took right.

We remember come election day vote office. ...meanwhile, ***en******tire Republican Party thinks democratic hoax.*** Eh 9/11 barely 3k deaths. That’s like nothing compared population. What’s big deal?!  successful conversion therapy already 

So yes maybe need shield. 🤷‍♂️ Hopefully results one keeps popping YouTube advertisements... Sponsored supporters. guess serial killer murdering 1771 people per day cool them.  really think whole thing would different first hot spot somewhere like Mississippi. understand NYC feel like much country thinks rich,liberal,hipster,musical loving city folk aren’t real Americans vegan bodies overreacted. Obnoxious Yep, going back school September. really wish 12th grade year, thought lucky looks like school year shittier last. Really wanted fun last year school too... doesn't. share 49s virus over. younger people spreading place, everyone spreading it. It’s accurate say never control. 

They’re getting higher numbers actually test couple thousand people day... sure got downvoted, you’re probably right. everybody freaking virus vast majority catch develop serious symptoms. Everyone advocating masks without sufficient scientific evidence prove effectiveness. might well mandatory prayer entering every room. I'm scared big brother take rights away protect me. *in Mayan calendar heard ""they dont anything worthy deserving life"" Good thing Trump wants cut funding testing! impact state reports. easy catch semen, Mike Pence would walking around full face shield. never done social distancing, mask wearing, seeing hand sanitizer/cleaning products flying shelves normal flu seasons.

Yeah, near bad virus.

With shutting country down, masks, distancing, still several times worse worst typical flu year less half time.

What part much worse normally close entire gig economy enforce small businesses close every flu season? normally deny flights coming various major countries regular basis?

No. flu anywhere near severe ss currently facing.

Again, getting?

Your comments claiming 100% opposite examples say.

How perfectly, exactly wrong everything? I've already seen supporters flip-flop well. also seen continue hold ignorant views still supporting him. 

Not would start wearing masks get vaccine COVID-19. Heck yeah! jealous FREEDOM BIG get abducted supposed federal agents streets without cause!! Canadians can't that!



/s Absolutely! also cook fresh food yourself. People sub sure sensitive. mfw little girl money me... Interesting go back several hundred years immediately went towards nukes.
Yes nukes deterrent, one starts flying it’s game over. 
I’m strongest budget address militaries small budget percentage total us budget seems redundant talking cutting down. Right... Trump dictator action taken without right? States power they're beholden mighty God Emperor Trump. Go home. honestly can't believe people taking Trump's intelligence. party picked Joe Biden run president. mean come guys listening try talk lately? He's going get crushed debates. pretty much given true infections much larger actual infections, given possibility someone never presents symptoms.

i know 10 x....but early testing capacity.....yeah. positives indicative spread.

NOW? 

I think seeing slow states realized opened soon.

AZ, TX, maybe even CA.   

not sure enough people enough testing states robust virus growth present meaningful way overall numbers. going see see.\

in opinion. odd see governments paying citizens. see citizens following safety guidelines. seeing countries going back normal. government country says possible actually watching happen. people country say possible acknowledge going countries. Yo stock name buy? I'm sure 50 immediately started masking self isolating found (/s)  That's people plan bodyslamming people would say tho Zika Ebola found tears semen. doubt different.  way could prevented this... never saw coming. sorta unfair imply HK handling badly stage title?I prefer use boring title tbh.A second wave bound happen. Let's hold horses, see HK handles. far none statements HK officials unreasonable cautious enough.  Yeah, think understand bad talking here. bootstrapping business opportunities. end USA super power... Fall USSR-like demise. Defaulting debt promises. 50 states unable fulfil obligations. choose print money time would devalue currency point actual realized inflation would back paying people work. Majority small medium sized businesses would go bankrupt. able pay government employees. Banks would first go paper hold properties would go unpaid additional months simultaneously value would deteriorate due aforementioned inflation lack businesses ability function. house cards. systemic February, almost entirely systemic top bottom left right. 

There literally jobs go back lockdown over. would standing around looking holding cash worthless live. nearly 20 percent positivity rate florida. Results take average nine days. Every single day every site runs tests. aren’t even testing everyone numbers control. Fake headline, reported

And Kemp encouraging Georgians voluntarily wear masks public **months**. People really need taught Typhoid Mary Completely agree. Watch someone treats weaker sorts. That's true nature ones cost ton money likely would cost ton money end-of-life care. pulling costs forward.

Regardless, problem funding part Medicare. problem fee-for-service model provider side. need equivalent NHS US. Yes, embarrassment, considered joke last time, laughed him, (???) whatever happened, somehow made it. Maybe underestimate time. see dropping case numbers again, won’t see dropping death numbers.

it take month see dropping case numbers turn dropping deaths though. inging ? Alberta going regular schooling less teachers.

not masking suggested. guess maybe volume? Maybe Uber driver gets 30 40 fares day - go metro city rush hour, there's three four times many people time carriage. enough deal corona. head hurts imagining daily life right I've kid I've adult. much better adult. Ugh. need briefings. asshole going say inject disinfectant again. Fucking brainwashed morons support guy that's best fuck up. Chinese happy hear that. guess would come think bad economy. two month national hard shutdown prolonged raging pandemic? It’s even political statement, matter fact. I’m afraid economy looks like next winter close down(I small business) two months. 

I live part state avoided first phase crap. shut month. Business still sucks though it’s obvious go back normal shit rage. certain amount animosity towards states governors cant basic math. WTF think gonna happen? Looks like upside mcdonalds logo. See that's something know. That's huge increase. I'm surprised he's racist piece shit. Hawaii keep us let sane countries. Also less density. Everyone drive cars helps here. restaurants bars open, knows Yes, still objective fact Biden's *current* lead polls much larger Clinton's was, remains even adjust margin error 2016.

Doesn't guarantee anything, course, Trump objectively weaker position then. turn around say, ""I saying wearing masks since beginning look much things improved since have!"" [Simpsons Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) asked state’s residents “commit” wearing mask four weeks, **despite ongoing lawsuit Atlanta officials mandating face covering worn.**  suppose California's saving grace prompt/early actions policy, opposed states dragged feet (ranging weeks months).

One would think CA governed by, say, Kemp DeSantis? Things would likely far worse state time. Hospitals rio grande valley area Texas overrun. It’s relatively poor, unhealthy area couple hospitals begin with. 2nd hot spot still Houston world class hospital system Yup, nurses overwhelmed lot pulling retirement early, leaving rest us exhausted daily basis. plus many getting sick due inadequate airflow PPE, flu season tipping point lot states. understand perspective. agree bound Constitution. social media platform views users. merely provides outlet. think would concern people greatly, example, author's books banned bookstore political views. Pablo Neruda? Karl Marx? Adolf Hitler?

What museums barred paintings Frida Kahlo, Fransisco Goya, Banksy, somewhat controversial views? say every idiotic group Facebook impactful voice above. valid silence voice offends one group, valid silence every voice might ever offend anyone. case, benefit even outlet? Cute cat pics great, promote conflict debate learn. Unfortunately, going get worse, work city lot elderly people &amp; lot saying won’t get vaccine rushed &amp; won’t put poison body since it’s choice.....at point I’ve given thinking others &amp; care &amp; family. many believe flying spaghetti monster? need answers. true though....is not??  wholeheartedly agree!!  lives matter except elderly, minorities get shot police, white people also get shot police, protesters taken away unknown authorities, immigrants, people wearing masks, etc etc... Still sounds like selfishness me. Can't recall knowing selfish person, example, admitted selfish. define selfishness, comparison narcissism? tried explain dad cloth masks work, linked several virologists/epidemiologists urging mask usage. Got called idiot antifa leftist. Deleted Facebook immediately talking sister apparently hurt fee-fees whole family thinks rude one. 

He’s retired home zero exposure virus outside getting groceries takeout, meanwhile I’m constantly exposed every day work(in county jail ~600~ cases) official HR policy can’t make clerical employees test positive stay home “reasons”. someone fever checked door sent home. 2 people office mysteriously absent past 2 weeks told close exposure told wanted get tested. 

I’m done. don’t care think I’m mean. I’ve breaking point years camels back broke. Freedom supposed cost buck o' nine. Price gone up. lot people know this, elephant, snake aligator completely different animals, true. wonderful thing. File under: Duh. Trumpkin jesus god hope Average age much lower Latin America, they'll better fatality rate.  time over, deaths per capita correlate quite well average age. Saying ""some people"" vague gets. 

Yeah, that's usually happens NOVEL viruses. literally learning go. able right observe report. ""some"" people reporting neurological, brain lung damage, tells us death worst thing could happen. 

It's anti-science, point. looking concrete, set stone data many right now. happening every single person? No. happening people? Yes. rate? impossible say. Everyone reacts differently virus. happening? Yes! worry? That's decide. 

All I'm telling layers consider simply looking ""CONFIRMED/DEATH"" cases. telling read entire statement. obviously words, told say. That's rich. mocking Biden wearing masks long ago.  best mortality rate!!! Schools need reopen. mind absolutely cannot changed this. damage done children bad home lives much worse damage COVID demographic proven least danger it.


EDIT: Yep go ahead downvote, stupid fucking privileged know-it-alls. know like community half kids school get single meal home per day, FARMs thing allowing get close adequate nutrition. know like like community 25% students sufficient levels technology home participate online learning. fucking concerned virus politically correct thing (though admittedly fault turned political issue) even consider that, like many times life, solutions create problem solve. live hotspot? No, it’s not. last time 9 month preventative school shutdown? Spanish flu? Nope. WWI 2? No. Polio? Negative. Hong Kong Flu? Nope. Cuban Missile Crisis? Again, no. 

We never gambled generations education like right now.   Imagine thinking dead means consequences. whole family anti-science you? apologize already said...Trump Piece Shit! 6.9% Noice. like odds... Must mean school safe. maybe “are f’ing stupid?” right high got clipped off. Wait, think COVID19? That's place usually see people talking sub science-based, - sub discussion, specifically science-based discussion.

I say seems little facetious ask statistics long-term effects virus that's actively studied less six months. statistics anyone could find would necessity incomplete, think unknown side effects unknown percentage cases somehow *less* unnerving... well, we're page one. he's vain said interviews want press satisfaction seeing mask taking pictures. that's interested WMD again. even proof two person exist conmection organization. caught hackers, stating specific unit corp working with, using general term like Ministry state Security means know anything Chinese intelligence unit. Also, like they're getting social interaction school instruction. Remote learning sucks, remote social interaction sucks *nothing*, like formal learning anything approaching constant across human history. Homeschooling great, norm millions years human history world fall apart. Six months Zoom class screen time usual turning kids psychopaths. desperately want kids go back safe –– older daughter sad away school –– jesus christ reopen people act like three months away school going cripple kids life (I mean, assuming reopen people say anything good faith, which, lol). much could vaccine cost? even 220 dollars piece lot money (73 billion)

our military budget 760 billion annually. Dude cannot actually believe that... Come on!!!! Testing DECREASED!!!

Deaths slow reported rising slightly? They've doubled getting worse day. guys keep brushing hard evidence going get better time soon. Except he's unpopular likely turn regular intelligent folks wearing masks. doomed society. US living “prolonged raging pandemic”. reported first case January 21st now, six months later, still getting rising case numbers struggling hospital capacity areas.

This case countries like Italy Canada brought initially strong outbreaks control. recently discovered King Nightshift blown away! Well everyone bar wearing masks thing, social distancing hand washing mean make safe it’s rocket science dead people can't vote, go back wage slaves. I'm intrigued. common relationship early symptoms lifelong severe issues noticeable symptoms? We're still sure ramifications disease, early information stellar. Death rate super important, plenty viruses (or severe complications) take months play out.

The ""rare complication"" among kids called ""MIS-C"" turning less rare thought, kids developing complication months initial diagnosis (if ever diagnosed all).

Looking symptoms &amp; virus behaves, MIS-C looks like could caused severe damage thyroid. damage goes undetected long (which long all) could result mental handicaps, growth defects, etc. basically irreparable.

We know scope disease long time. Trump butchered handling pandemic straight ass. see small win instead ""fuck Trump! Admit us wrong"" That's actually thing showings Jaws float tubes.

I hoping finally make way one summer Gg would say school office would risk level Wait, reddit? thought Napster. download Enter Sandman? wearing hairnets team probably gave ultimatum re-election prospects That's ok, neither he. inevitably catch NY (in positive cases). Probably within week. 

As far deaths... never say never... Hence public part That's actually 180 tho. Never said ""Do Wear Mask"" made sure basic rights infringed. give basic rights, rest follow. woulda thunk it?!?  bought extra toilet paper. admit it. also wear mask, wash hands social distance. hoard masks. made sewing machine.   says 99.96% deaths adults. 0.04% children. Thus 144,438 reported deaths (as today), 58 children. politicians answer. can't say 58 children died. work hospital exposed find confirmed positive case gets tested comes back. told minimal information, possibly exposed date X (about 2 weeks prior). think happens? NOTHING! test unless symptoms. Even cases asymptomatic properly contact test FUCKING HOSPITAL. walking around, possibly sick, possibly spreading go figure own. Even order test immediately week waiting get get results. week maybe infectious idea. want quarantine well hope afford suffer retaliation employer, hospital unfortunately focus going bankrupt focusing FUCKING HEALTH.

When hear anti national healthcare people talk want piss them.  someone spits you, please spit face make direct eye contact Fucking hate living Arkansas sometimes. got pissed coworker today. Montana mask mandate inside wear mask. mostly work outside. share desk wasn’t wearing morning got leave shoved mask pocket. wearing end day least retiring next Friday. isn’t point. You’re one trying keep safe! Also parents went local marina weekend asked mom wore mask? said don’t county. Goddamn guys ones trying save! reason friend house since March! lib. weird way spell ""wild ass guesses"". Is...is real life, deep fake? Certainly explains certain President could get healthcare line with, say, Germany, we'd much better healthcare services saving around \~$1.8 TRILLION dollars year public private spending ($10,600/capita vs $5100/capita). 

Unfortunately there's thing free lunch. There's bunch reasons America pays healthcare, overnight fixes

Administrative waste really surest thing, using current costs medicare, really knock 2% total budget, 5% suggested countries.

The next drug prices. Pharma makes near 80% profits, can't cut random, still want incentivize reinvestment drug discovery programs.

Then defensive medicine. Doctors stop ordering tests Americans stop lawyering every trip ER. Also, price malpractice insurance gets wrapped rates hospitals need charge leads to...

Hospital procedure costs compared everywhere else. Part asshole MBAs run for-profit hospitals charging whatever feel like. Part extra tests run defensive medicine.

Finally, elephant room: Americans flat unhealthy require care tend culturally always ask more. fatter, sleep less, eat processed foods, stressed work, exercise less, etc... also factors largely worse outcomes. Pretty much every medical procedure increased risk complications patient obese chronic health condition. American attitude towards healthcare generally, ""I'll want fix later (so evident crisis),"" along healthy dose of, ""Do everything necessary keep 96 year old mother alive."" Crass, true.

So even cut admin waste (1-2%), pharma costs 30% (3%), stop defensive medicine (2-3%), eliminate for-profit hospitals for-profit pricing (\~2-3% drop), even cut doctor, nurse, staff salaries 10% (1%), looking max reduction 12%. Huge, Germany. big thing we'd lower costs Germany levels would complete cultural shift America.

Send people hospice earlier. Live overall healthier lives. okay taking drugs absolute top class, okay generics (many Americans aren't, crazy enough). Stop suing doctors hospitals. Etc...

The cultural shifts, much harder battles win. Hmm, ok, thanks. Yeah supporters change tune also along 
 What's brains? Shit Sherlock. known months wonder cases skyrocketing many states. I'm sure care tbh live time period nearly entirety human knowledge available finger tips. Unfortunately incredible amount people literally can't comprehend basics distort anything requires critical thinking. vast majority humanity deserves itself. attitude, that's get. Cool got something removed like poster made mistake summarizing headline accurate way. High five, snowflake. Tegnell says he's right? news? covering dogs biting men now? even care he's point. make end. Well think New York paved way, unfortunately, places learn treatment options, etc. That's we're working on. Millennials, gen Z couple gen X's putting differences aside try fix things.

Unfortunately history really support possibility... I'd love could but, see what's going on. point them.

Sadly predicted January, Poverty rampent, social issues getting worse, COVID starting show head. textbook. That's awful. ostracized community reckless. theory.

We know even thousand deaths wrongly attributed Covid? true USA. fuck ups pandemic frequently highlighting emboldens conspiracy theorists counter productive. opinion.. really matter point. I'm watching people pass around petitions change law Michigan ensures mask mandate. Republican members legislature still pushing anti-mask rhetoric celebrated it. seasonality significant impact would definitely consider pretty surprising. Could mean rough winter. NY properly overwhelmed? know got slammed also heard get point emergency ad hoc hospitals got used, true?  right case Pfizer. took money pretty much guarantee retain control.

Moderna paid development, manufacturing. vaccine already trials government awarded money.

Johnson Johnson even trials going, sure wtf they're even doing.

What mean: subsidies programs low income, wealthy afford it, middle class fucked over, always. friend mine got line get tested. asked fill form turned in. hour waiting, decided leave. couple days later, reveived letter mail saying he'd tested positive Covid-19. Gotta love that. surprising  Yea are... signed deals Corning June, tossing Manhattan project money several startups like ApiJect SiO2. SiO2 particular looks like they’re track make enough vials US.  Um, caught home, would literally immaculate infection 🇨🇦 Canada awesome think point okay paint China negative light this, specifically CCP, quashing earlier least give world head's serious epidemic. Yup... covid-19 already killed 1 every 2284 Americans. Meaning take mask head nearest COVID party 10 times less likely die? would collapse america know Put bottom part, leaving nothing exposed Yes, believe second strand original SARS virus. please don’t simply take word fact. Please research.  State Deep South here. Neighboring county starts school back tomorrow mask mandate, adamant teachers staff go back. 

That county’s school board virtual meeting tonight unsafe gather group. TRUMP 2021! *too amazing* face real consequences. Sounds exactly like US. Glad I'm one senses this. somewhat disturbing. 
  
If reading this, either: 
a) prepping. 
b) prepped. seemed incredulous idea would poll numbers. anyone half brain, obvious he's poll numbers. realized late people following this, fucked sure brilliant stupid. It’s average American citizens fault, it’s completely lays feet idiotic federal/state governments re-opened insanely early created public health crisis. Attacking random people wearing masks Americans, average, wear masks rate countries shifts blame parties responsible, White House multitude state governments beyond fucking incompetent claim science based sub it...isn't, news collation based sub.

and covid 19, unlike nearly EVERY.SINGLE.VIRUS.ON.THE.PLANET often causes lung scarring, practically untreatable right now.

To address edit: telling someone research problem absolute opposite 'anti science', want put effort researching -- likewise, him, providing it. People would still do. prestige. Working class jobs hard everyone even pay good.

There lots people would prefer engineer plumber (no matter pay). Yes. 

I say half people talk think masks stupid don’t wear them. sudden change heart?

He's desperate. Fucking do-nothing, blood hands liar. Biden hand working angle helping people got hit economically pandemic, like helping get back work. case worst enemy, worst enemy building platform it. pretty much backpedal work effective strategy next months. Again, personality traits empirically-based common names. Imagine pretentious you’d sound said “look, found rana temporaria!” chart says shopping fine. others I've seen say thing too. county judge lifted ban large groups (up 100 people) right rodeo. It’s absolutely ridiculous. came America planted China military. Keep up. die ass line, cares.

What utter failure. Right, weird thing is, mysterious pneumonia going around, people test positive coronavirus don’t have. feel nothing. matter well study done, laboratory results rarely apply real life uncountable confounding factors. average person following reinfection reports. confirmed reinfections long time = top whiskey. think talking putting bleach sunlight body calculated good Trump move, he's really, really, unbelievably stupid, product segment society nurtures inheritors advantaged merit intelligence. Worried, will, unfavorable, sorry

Good use breath. Nov. 3   think demonstrated schools closed less severe threats 'World War II'. 

As Spanish Flu, disease listed reached pandemic levels US far know, I'll say possible public health knowledge improved somewhat since 1918.

Also, doubt able send child school want to. schools actually shut fall semester seems unlikely be. free make whatever decision want there.

Edit: oh, polio outbreaks absolutely led schools close parents pull children school attendance. Areas quarantined parents tried keep children isolated outbreaks. Again, normal reaction potentially harmful disease existing vaccine. Getting plane US definitely asking get sick. Alrighty. countries listed ahead total deaths per capita. could benefit individual billionaires? lot people probably ones going around calling people narcissists  None us surprised 2 hour taxpayer-sponsored ad canned beans. Surgeon General sort supposed leading something like already? Also explains support current administration. push glasses they're face. know works.  Mayan’s 2012 = America’s 2020 think point he’s waiting hold governors - looking Kim Reynolds , Iowa - see go along recommendations. whole briefing sounded great like “I’m supposed say this, don’t believe I’ll say it. interject comments really think I’m reading.”  Translation: rich able afford cured

The rest us dead meat.

In words: Survival *richest*. evaporate air, right? leave (smaller than) .3 micron virus floating small enough get mask...? don’t seem understand. course amount deaths per day reflect amount testing, that’s laughable obvious. 

But applied broad population, amount deaths per day apply estimate number infections. also obvious.

If disease known statistically kill 10% people infects, end 100 dead people, it’s pretty easy infer must 1000 total infections (likely 2-3
Weeks prior) account 100 dead.

Same exercise here, difference don’t certain number mortality rate. months data analysis best recent mortality rates fall .6% .25%

I know you’re saying people really struggle ever admit fault concede point. I’m one people. Hope clears up. guess concentration camp pray G-d pray Allah? that's think Nazi. guess wants elected Yes it’s one infuriating things watching supporters. blatantly given flying fuck re-election, previous election far happened, supporters don’t seem see it. It’s crazy anyone watching isn’t cult, every day says things clearly coming re-election standpoint. put shade anything hear says see exactly much mean. COVID bad primarily due quickly spreads overwhelms healthcare, really Spanish flu. it, 50 million died like 2 years that? world's population lot less, lot less dense / rural (though, troop mobilizations WW1, living trenches military camps, definitely help there...). COVID probably kill 50 million long time, ever (being semi-optimist become endemic, certainly could endemic, sure, years it'll kill 50 million lot slower).

The Spanish Flu cut people youth early 20s en masse. terrible pandemic. standard flu, bit deadly, lot contagious, also Spanish Flu. Maybe mutates something deadly contagious incubation period issues still super-spreader asymptomatics, remains seen. would very, bad started case. Hopefully America feels way November.  April's fool loose speculation, wonder Scandinavian countries might ""easy mode"" general, since we're already pretty asocial bunch. :)

Maybe easy mode + light measures + summer enough get R &lt; 1.

Might immunity well, though I'd surprised big effect already. latest serological study Stockholm around mid-June found [around 17% though criticized possibly biased based voluntary testing.

Outside harder-hit areas, [it's looking pretty cases mostly going well. Oh agree completely. I’m 29 weeks pregnant 30s. possibility (or losing baby) haunting point refuse even see parents started dinning restaurants. wish people would take seriously. heart breaking. Yes, frustrated angry political leadership

It feels like downplays Trump's history call anything political leadership, like anybody could believe he's motivated anymore. miss good old days great points. You’re absolutely right, don’t know long term effects be. might well calling “asian disease” xenophobia racism perpetuates. knows he’s SARS kind fade. Look 29-nucleotide deletion. mutated way became less able infect. said less widespread mutating faster. ones refuse wear masks, yes. ""freedoms"" important tiny gesture would benefit entire fucking world Mars Years It’s sad many people live lives without taught teach read Trump's voice Hoping you’re correct, friend.  *does Mars calendar yet Elon? But, but, keep changing minds: wear mask don’t wear mask! keep up? /s What's that? Letting major national government track every movement going well? could possibly seen coming? live Texas. Everyone know consistently partying gotten sick. It’s matter time know someone Albany, GA early hot spot. traced back 2 funerals. scary fast spread overwhelmed hospital. 


 one family members infected, SUDDENLY saying masks helps?

Don't know mindwork Trumpians voted vote him

&amp;#x200B;

would love hear Trumpian/supporters defending He's trying save face?? /s 1% 1% faith misplaced. thing might make full disaster advances treatment. faith directed health care workers. believe Bannon back team recently saying Fox News handles pandemic decision maker Americans. guess he’s one banging table appease votes. know weird, old Boy Scout troop operated smoothly current White House. Like, waaaaay smoothly. people act like they've never run anything. too. would love buy one Shocking news Furthermore idiotic statement. 

Let’s really say numbers dialed far infections statistically true. 

Say we’re catching 68k truly 300k getting infected day 2000 dying day. 

If 300,000 Americans got per day, we’d looking roughly 1000+ days infection whole country get it. 

So knowing that, feel it? 

By stats, progressively get sickness, we’re looking 2 million dead. 

I bet feel great 2 million dead, right? It’s infographic. Helping teach them, teach yourself. part understand? Would help kids homework struggling with? I’m person replied to, family teachers, much want remote classes safety.

That said, simply things don’t translate well online learning many students. 

Algebra, example, much needed teacher standing shoulder showing exactly messing up, spent two days week staying school extra help. 

Once clicked, got it, could go there. college, trying learn calc (professor genius, mumbled incoherently scribbled illegibly), completely lost again, ended transferring course. couldn’t learn book, book. 

I’d perfectly competent teach child math, perhaps “common core” way. wouldn’t even know begin.

I think naysayers need understand, remote isn’t go-to, it’s preferable alternative “not all”. 

Everyone wants classes person, disagreement occurs it’s conversation acceptable deaths students (roughly 1% age demo), higher percentage teacher faculty deaths, given increased rates risk demographics. 

I’d say, losing months, even year, learning, worth avoiding preventable child deaths, preventable teacher deaths. 

Oh, teachers get paid double digit percentage bonus step foot inside classroom (should choose to). They’re treated shitty poorly paid begin with, this. Factor death/lifelong injury/potential sterilization, yeah, money better there. border ever really ""closed"". problem bad Hidalgo County, stretch assume hospitals across border dealing similar issues far less support. say far less support, seeing pictures stories nurses working McAllen, would remiss give even much credit way handled/supported side border.

Simply put, McAllen capacity, south border likely looking capacity issues well. turned away hospital there, gonna search immediate care closest proximity regardless consequences. sorry, mistake, insomnia weird effects! course not. Fucking right Nah, we’re intelligent shenanigans. Also predict he’ll sort step back forth mask line. He’s kind forced hates forced things he’ll eventually rebel say ‘freedom’ stuff soon industry like call “Well, duh”. clearly Spain. fuck 'former classmate electrical engineering collage Chengdu, China'? 

What name collage study? know name know chengdu even electrical engineering collage. court document use kind vague non specific words.? quality American court?  He's spoiled brat go hundreds millions father, lied taxes get money, surrounded yes-men entire life, never known concept failing grace someone something bail out. probably honestly believe virus would simply go away, would win reelection. I'd love see reaction wins November. Lol shut fuck up. least lunatics creative excuses, phoning in. laziest attempt conspiracy I've ever seen here. Throw deep state comment something. Unsurprised surprising still funny “standing line”? tremendous. Wow, you’re woke! /s That’s true politician. 

They supposed representative constituents. add outdoors crowding, i.e. protests, either. Thanks comment friend   we're pedantic actual number asshole possibilities 165,000,000 majority half even understand COVID-19 19 name. doubt would understand another virus 2. brainwashed. irresponsible tell vote two terrible options. people like wake hell up, continue problems. estimate total cases based coronavirus deaths + excess deaths, using fatality rate I'm confused. thought said ""Alabama""? Dumb like american.

She even knew...and still moron.

&amp;#x200B;

Land oppressed, home uneducated... One early hotspots Louisiana rest south pay heed happened there, Louisiana currently fully second wave. Economical environment set fleece citizens EVERYTHING have.

In countries, that'd considered symptom completely failed government. probably overly generous. Many people go week without losing job. Many low income jobs, including pretty much entire service industry, paid sick leave. [average 10 days service industry average 7. number likely pulled higher numbers hotel sector higher-level roles plenty entry level restaurant workers cleaners get bugger PTO.

You find interesting though incomplete debatable statistics around sick leave use. Around 60% taking 5 days past year. average # sick days per year less 3. can't find reliable source this, probably there's legal requirement provide paid sick leave, overall shitty system. Yes grandma problem. many stupid motherfuckers store really situation? people experience brain damage heart damage well. saw article said damage organs talking UN? point is, said, comparison isn’t fair make without couching uncertainties. commenter making comparisons, nobody mentioned erroneous underlying thinking end thread, pop in. Sorry seemed like calling specifically. Lots viruses symptoms. 14 days ridiculous turnaround time. Jesus Christ, 16 people one house? rumor circulating virus humans much longer infectious probably localized urban regions went unnoticed, thus adapted really well bodies mutated went viral. 53% tested positive told isolate tested not, probably talking us lol Rep. Candice Pierucci family sat small Sunday dinner close relative last week, said took precautions, including hand sanitizer ready. one inkling sickness, next day....

tldr: one safe. Stay away get shot US? Obviously neither going school sleeping bed safe anymore genuinely idea absolutely would. nobody would care. Glad well now, sounds rough. elective surgery, yes people's insurance call herniated discs broke bulging discs stuff elective, job left, living streets. got laid January unionized factory crazy good insurance. paying$1200 year someone knew lupus Humana paying $900 MONTH People like act like every states’ residents businesses monolithic entity. Truth matter there’s people every state right thing like there’s people every state selfish pricks. Charity solution, palliative sad tell live US crazy testing delay culture ""You're coming work anyway!""

This illustrates perfectly couple reasons long list reasons are. live Fullerton cannot understand people live OC. TAKE PEOPLE TAKE SERIOUSLY!? basically left house 4 months, college classes cancelled, leave house wear mask. I'm fucking frustrated, GODDAMN POINT EVERYONE GONNA SAY ""Meh fuck want go beach pay much drinks loud ass bar.""

Blaming leader expecting (or him, referring trump case) solve problem pointless.

If trump charge it’s got elected, blame voters (and didn’t).
If 1/3rd American believe numbers made up, earth flat, covid hoax... whatever shit want believe, it’s « leaders », it’s trump. It’s new situation appear magic somehow 4 years ago.

To paraphrase government officials topic: "" care today zero deaths, next day two 1 zero deaths. statistical blimps. care weekly downward upwards trends. death case count trending down, something right. starts going up, means something wrong, need change strategy"". Ok happy then. stay inside guess. right thing. Please get well. still going disappear like miracle someday he'll right. 

No, really. joking aside, ""at cost""? price individual dose? 

you still need cover doses made trials, lost batches developing process. pay testing quality folks operate support filing.

also pay engineering group found way manufacture vaccine existing equipment, and/or capital spent retool existing manufacturing lines new product.

then pay R&amp;D folks that.

so even without executive pay, there's company primarily self-funded. Companies don’t capital lying around ramp research production something even guaranteed work sell. governmental assistance give fluid capital *to perform research must faster would otherwise occurred.*

A company obligation lose money crisis. don’t see complaining PPE makers sanitization companies continuing make profit crisis. 

Maybe doctors nurses hospital personnel take one team crisis make exactly need pay bills.

It’s one thing company ratchet price gouge piss people. costs $50 make cost sell $75, $100, it’s fair allows money future crises research. costs $50 make charge $1000 it? Sure. Complain then. zero evidence plan charge. crisis

Sweet baby Jesus, ANYTHING right? mean God, put man moon can't even make virus tests work? WTF?

Wake people. Every place going second wave. Ok what's Virginia? that's I'm talking about. one hundreds reasons moved. STOP HITTING BUTTON!!! Ok. actually 6 excess every confirmed COVID, ages 20-49, March 15th June 6th. 366 deaths total age group, 66 confirmed COVID. appear updated methodology since read study.

Obviously deaths caused SARS-CoV-2. regards cause death printed certificates non-COVID excess dead, money majority MI (heart attack), stroke, aneurysm. sources USA, Australia, seasonal flu motor accidents drastically.  get anyone knowledge top scientists reddit. Unfortunately, noone knows stage. 2nd wave definitely real chance Europe, guaranteed. there's one thing I've learned whole ordeal far people much selfish ever imagined. feel embarrassed American right now. got tested DC (no symptoms exposure. Needed get test enter Maine going holiday week). Didn’t get results back fro 7 days. husband didn’t get 10 days. Though think bee symptomatic would gotten results faster. Let’s smart like Donald Trump let’s stop testing everybody nobody problem. Wait say Walmart closes Thanksgiving? country give shit able afford food would rather come work potentially infect co-workers instead paying stay home 2 weeks, I'm guessing free testing viable lot people. Otherwise starve. designed way purposely. Houston though? Seems strange location close. Typhoid Mary arrested multiple times. moved different town pseudonym. unfortunate power asymptomatic entire life. Freedom’s another word nothing left lose. Dutch guy living U.S I've heard insane stories Americans talking healthcare Europe. blame Fox news. good misinforming Americans destroying country process. Oh people invested enough situation scientific community notice that, let us honest, data already muddied enough is, tampering make data usable.

But, what's worse people invested enough, notice care. USA enough anti maskers crazies moment, would absolutely love government lowered case numbers one reason another. already running around conspiracy theories, imagine happy they'd something like happened. option additional 500 million doses (which would cover US population).

Since 2 dose vaccine, 100 million would actually little worrying.

Of 3 going phase 3s US, Pfizer actually seemed best immune response, probably one watch.  current CDC nucleic acid test kits SARS-CoV-2 generate 30% false-positive 20% false-negative results best state public health laboratory, Dr. Sin Hang Lee reported peer-reviewed article published   

Disgraceful. forgot Trump's strategy reducing numbers. stop testing they'll drop right down... [In May Ford fuck lives 16 people... 16 people one house hold - 11 children. sounds like nightmare Still manslaughter someone dies knew infected potentially deadly virus still went work. loved ones got infected, critically I'll, and/or died, household situation matter. 

I agree. difficult situation. still give right put lives danger. 

The solution unified federal plan pay people stay home 4-8 weeks virus fizzled out. Enforcing kids wearing masks problem.

Grades 1 3 keep pulling without thinking.

5 8 acts rebellion.

9 12th ""lose"" masks constantly cool.

Its really easy enforce short term especially long term Yup. I’m hearing secondhand murmurs behind scenes NE states real plan reopen. mean, they’ve announced plans, real plan close shop. can’t say parents would load pitchforks torches. 

Keep eye way schools shut last time: we’re going delay 2 weeks. another 2 weeks, month. on. 

The last part speculation part, can’t/won’t speak I’ve heard heard from, say I’ve heard twice people know live different states. Someone check math, 100 tested 10%positive would mean 18 90 negatives actually positive three ten positive actually negative net gain 15 cases.

10% turns 25%, fml ""Good News"" flair? wait constructively interfere become one giant plague tsunami.

^((Probably works pandemics, I'm sure.)) ends concerning, especially false negatives state in? contact local health authorities, there’s guarantee anything. 

Shit fucked US. live Canada Non-owner occupied houses rentals pay double tax (going 1.5 tax next year). I've never deal seems like decent way somewhat balance it.  Honestly sick hearing NY let another state take limelight   took UK weeks get shit together. ski trip 5 Uk guys early March. tested positive return Canada. Shared results UK guys still told go work couldn’t get test 5 days. That’s blew quick. tested sent doctors Canada proof. try feeding 16 people, didn’t give check least $2000 way door 2 weeks wtf expect do. I'd say going higher risk going. taking care back good long-term, sounds really low risk corona-wise.  That's completely pointless. idea tell positive cases isolate, would better go queue backwards. going get cases 13 days, nobody use info, well infectious period virus people.

At least going queue backwards *some* people would get results early enough act on. go work even showing symptoms? That's messed up, especially ridiculous waiting time result. followers start wearing mask start worried. I’m happy wearing mask would prove exactly whatever says! YOLOANFL: live long. communist propaganda? /s Good no? politicized everything death America. think issue one side common sense solution sometimes backed science loves side. Climate change might closest *all* science acknowledges suggests something side that’s mainly US keeps questioning it.

The root may early, “It’s flu” comparisons pretty much downplayed severity disease. moved “It makes old people sick”, “Young people basically immune”, flip flopping masks early (that even Fauci admits did) help bolster people’s doubts them, etc. I’m sure thing contagious currently deadly Ebola, different tune would playing response this. response would situation, goodbye country. definitely makes worried deadlier pandemics future. paying 1k live single room SF. cunty IGs too.. even kids. Easy avoid people eating especially know person living tested positive. depend excess deaths *cause?* highly excess deaths year recorded pneumonia, example, fewer deaths due accidents/traffic fatalities shutdowns people traveling much. 

So overall, pneumonia deaths strange reason, fewer accident deaths, number may little hard interpret. Oh sorry, thought deer. never exited first wave, peak downtrend everyone got complacent opened up. second spike up. sense, second wave even though first wave never ended. guess could say two waves top other. people worn masks federal government heavily contact tracing 4 months ago could’ve even better spot :( Weird slightly topic question - Canadians look people coming America live (legally)?

My wife talking couple years now, I've always wondered we'd always outsiders so. asinine. Deport that's half bad..... oh wait... Everyone counts, ignorant thing say! 

Mismanagement elderly lockdown separate.  New York. I'm sure numbers bother you. percentage deaths New York elderly..... hmmm sound familiar. 

One lockdown, one didn't. mismanaged elderly.  huge deaths population.  related right? Whose using brain now? need build housing people are, tell people go housing is.

Why?

Edit: ask “why” another way: people move existing neighborhood “develop” it, even cost displacing residents, (as “society large”) considers “good” thing (because economy! Money! Yay!). idea developing areas desperate need people, existing infrastructure, somehow beyond realm possibility. ideal cram people less space, versus making use vast swathes empty land (and existing empty homes) across country?  That's errrm, 25% entire population already tested six days discovery index case. wife test Ohio; waited hour get swabbed, got results hour. brother, lives city, waiting week results. 

It's like definition phrase ""Results may vary."" Exactly. fact employers obligation doesn’t change individual’s obligation. doubt change him. starters, Boris already introduced lockdown even testing positive. Also way announced testing positive different. Boris announced via social media recordings home safest way it. Bolsonaro announced reporters live person took mask. Also Bolsonaro still continues downplay virus even Trump changed tone yesterday. think anything change him. due combination open borders welfare state. Neither fault particular lady.

I think fair debate immigration, wall, welfare, hiring illegal immigrants, individual woman, likely, best can.

Jesus want us casting stones her. Literally anything build housing basically Yeah, happened me. Requested something nut-free, substituted something nuts. Went store &amp; there’s item requested. obvious available items picked. would absolutely tragic places got wiped turned apartments young working class minorities immigrants. confirming nobody contracts virus dies within 14-16 day period? geneva (Switzerland) 3000(ish) dollar 2 bed apartment that's meh

It definitely expensive Geneva. alternative Geneva, Alabama buy 3 bedroom house $90,000. 

I recommend anyone considering moving Alabama spend month first. medical opinion.  household 16? Sheesh. fine 130k dead. 140k dead draws line, apparently. post way reasonable. would never forgive best friend telling me. started hanging mine past month get tested, grateful transparent me, bunkered two weeks I’m already laid off. friends family need get clue, right thing. need start hiring bouncers enforce mask rules. someone doesn’t want mask throw ass out. going phase 3 trials. Basic safety established, immune response seen, we're looking effective now. Good luck isolating household almost 20. Unless lives mansion physical possibility admitting virus would likely landed streets. USA failed country.  obviously read comments Houston neighbors Nextdoor. imagine virus enact enforce stay home order? Maybe bypassing queue wrong way put it, separate service, separate private hospital. Someone using taking away resources NHS, slowing people's treatment. anything allowing spend money somewhere else frees space NHS. 16 people?? flophouse?

But importantly: expect people voluntarily comply self-isolating orders economic survival depends complying. happen every. single. time people getting paid trouble. US gripped deadly pandemic, save 15% car insurance. Floridian here, yes many people driving mean, general since took office, hasn’t gained new voters. still base, antics leading since he’s office chipped away people begrudgingly gave chance 2016. flu isn’t health risk seven days you’re physically sick virus—it also lasting effects could affect health weeks, months, even permanently"". shes dying wouldnt go see her. Seeing one Sweden's biggest failures late reaction slow response virus, keeping restrictions place would likely give advantage if/when second wave comes around, compared countries would need reinstate lifted restrictions, possibly take time come new ones. Corona marathon, sprint.

Edit: Also, look face. Sounds like outhouse needs thing, chance actually stamping right thing summer, vitamin uv light side. 
trying fight winter everyone's nose flowing pointless. might well say maybe next summer vaccine sooner.  Biden wins popular vote, carries key swing states Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan Pennsylvania decent overwhelming margins.

throughout four key swing states gave Biden victory.
Having railed Chinese throughout campaign, calling Biden ""soft China,"" Trump delivers narrative claiming Chinese interfered U.S. election.


Trump indicates major national security issue, invokes emergency powers, directing Justice Department investigate alleged activity swing states. legal justification presidential powers invokes already developed issued Barr.


The investigation intended tick clock toward December 14, deadline state's Electoral College electors must appointed. issue Supreme Court harped Bush v. Gore ruling election process brought close, thus forbidding counting Florida ballots.


All four swing states Republican control upper lower houses state legislatures. state legislatures refuse allow Electoral College slate certified ""national security"" investigation complete.


The Democrats begun legal action certify results four states, appointment Biden slate electors, arguing Trump manufactured national security emergency order create ensuing chaos.


The issue goes Supreme Court, unlike 2000 election decide election favor Republicans. However, indicates December 14 Electoral College deadline must met; president's national security powers legally authorize investigate potential foreign country intrusion national election; Electoral College slate certified state December 14, Electoral College must meet anyway cast votes.


The Electoral College meets, without electors four states represented, neither Biden Trump sufficient votes get Electoral College majority.
The election thrown House Representatives, pursuant Constitution. relevant constitutional process, vote House state delegation, delegation casts one vote, determined majority representatives state.


Currently, 26 states majority Republican House delegation. 23 states majority Democratic delegation. one state, Pennsylvania, evenly split delegation. Even Democrats pick seats Pennsylvania hold 2018 House gains, Republicans would 26 24 delegation majority.


This vote would enable Trump retain presidency.

[How Trump Could Lose Election—And Still Remain President wife hair, super strict salon. can’t even get door without mask 20 questions, clients can’t bring anyone them, wait outside it’s time one waiting lounge/waiting area. also client wearing masks whole time, wearing gloves gown type apron. everything cleaned super thoroughly client. wouldn’t consider place medium/high, dunno others tho Seriously, would think hospitals tons death would money PPE getting paid covid deaths.

The evidence points contrary. three months ago. What's update? faaaiiiirr🎶 NYT keeps decent vaccine tracker running wishing death one fuck boy. I'll come back this. California passed NY cases today. I'll come back you. seems like pseudoscientific personal attack used make people feel superior, science that's 20 per dose? Ha. I’d love see president candidate answer religion question say “huh?

Using statistics like we're dealing human lives messed up. anything 3,000,000 deaths boring uneventful? *HUGE* age range... 11 kids feed. better go work.

Sorry can't afford hotel room dip trust fund. centralized, federal government gives money states increasingly stupid. function like federation planets capitalism I'm wondering many died influenza them

Probably caused quite lot suffering, hopefully shareholders ok. that's really matters end. Good thing immune system doesn’t rely solely antibodies. names people issues work let miss without positive result. even read comment YouTube saying deaths true. people still believe refuse wear masks.

I really understand believe people dying this. LOL NO, hold beer watch this- merica none died. end. 

If test positive... That's set up. There's 70% chance positive 30% chance not.

The general population stats zero relevance subset initially mentioned. areas almost solely outsourcing tests private lab providers.

Idiots gotta idiot Stay safe well! I’m sorry you’re afraid too, awful feeling reasons even worse Half recovered patients among hospitalized still suffering post recovery. we've found therapeutics cut death rate severe cases, dexamethasone...

If take 50% hospitalized patients developing issues given, claimed article, becomes apparent 25% death rate among severe cases would enough ensure cases wind surviving issues dead - *even ""mild"" cases ever develop health issues*.

We also know certainty ""mild"" cases developing lasting issues, however calculated rate prevalence yet. Intuition tells rate likely low double digits percentage. really hope wrong. looks like child grabbed dad side, came sudden change behaviour No,

California one law knowingly transmitting disease intentionally giving someone HIV. apparently illegal malignantly give someone HIV ""discriminatory"" LGBT. repealed that. area close all? 3 positive infections every 100,000 per day. averaging 1 hospitalization per day. absurdly low rate transmission.

Are going tell three genders ""male,"" ""female"" ""I'd rather say"" next saves government agencies filing cabinet space recognize 3 profiling human being? I've thinking psychology this, different cultural norms, think really missing half equation here.

If right thing, get benefit except feeling done right thing. get extra support, extra kudos, paid stay isolated, nice canned ham, nothing. tell people? risk job, relationships (people could blame test positive), awkwardness perhaps shame contacting people?

I think probably different approach needed want people things *for benefit people*.

I remember reading South Korea giving people basically care package required isolate/quarantine. Like actually something people go huge inconvenience cost staying inside weeks. get feeling cultures respect others others respect others. Shit, acquaintance mine told keep going work employer girlfriend awaited results. wasn’t girlfriend came positive said “oh probably stop coming in.” business people stupid.

Probably going path least resistance bit blasé later long-term costs. hard create lot kids.


That said, also several parents house. And? Chins also welding people apartment buildings physically could leave. hindsight, sure seems like better idea ""go beach spring break wear mask"" plan many states. I'm South Korea we're pretty good here. US system forces 5 children? I'm sure 3 fewer kids economic situation becomes far better.

Right now, Central Florida around 26% availability, average across state. Doctors said last months high number strokes heart attacks people waiting long treatment.

Very encouraging us work areas predominantly viewed hoax, therefore hoaxers leading decision making (hence, zero precautions, business usual, full contact football practices). Also, areas keeping positive cases secret stigma attached proving real illness. example, kids football team showing symptoms refusing get tested they'd practice 14 days kne wants patient zero. False negatives upwards 60% labs. house three us three us tested negative waited long get tested. like analogy, like drug cure kill depending application. Nailed it!

But... even care themselves, care failed ego. feel bad anti-maskers would probably find headlines upsetting. wonder firms paying lobbying political contributions Considering sitting around 3.5% currently fell probably wrong. government make money! didn’t anything spare could raise inflation slightly make nothing! programs absolutely paid for. government refuses 90 144 positive results false positives Trump wore ""religion"" sleeve. didnt anything show believes it. care theatrics, proves they'll continue theatrical ""belief"" office. Obviously not? See: ""making anonymized data available hard"" above?

Your making straw man argument, seriously no-one would suggest valuable part data. Maybe women home laying around like third base this, taking life easier like people making another human doing. Folks. mask mandates took long. healthcare providers ample supply beginning. Former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb estimated would six months things start significantly improve, widespread vaccinations (but also monoclonal antibodies treatments scale) would become available agree regarding importance this. However basis sub metrics - solid/hard metrics this. wish did. Two three, though?

Edit add - assume churches existed b4 Christianity initial form school governance, full civilization took role. this. able mange symptoms home meds DR prescribed. going hospital overrun time get tested control.....instead wait week testing time slot regional testing site. week test results inconclusive note retest. retest
..i sure positive. lingering breathing issues months later never existed got sick.  lucky quarantined work without positive company awesome situation. sucks everyone can't.  recently? Nah, Guinness world record slow learner! It’s choice hide that. It’s completely unethical hide suspected diagnosis. Haha ivory tower, fuckwit. assume know anything u know nothing all. privilege, tower, fact barely anything u absolute moron. Ive worked whole life made homeless 17. go fuck sharpest object find, fucking coward deserve everything country gives you. Enjoy trump. Fucking useless cockend.  Seriously, someone drink often cooks wine, beer, cider, go second store complete recipe really frustrating! Lol schools busy teaching kids essential basics like simplifying polynomials. Preparing practical things they’d use everyday isn’t job. don’t doubt get better source Newsweek? really unfortunate lack PTO sensitive file unemployment even one week Covid quarantine.

Continuing spread deadly virus selfish reasons ok. according news reports, that’s actually true. entire article may bull, Russia planning vaccinate vaccine gets approved (which could also bull). poor things quite grasp cause effect, challenging world live in. can't handle simple rules eventually die take massive stupidity them. MAGA - Make Assholes Go Away matter. adults school. College students campus. Faculty, hourly workers, custodians, etc.... school open. Yes, evidence suggests children may spread virus parents, children 20% population schools (including high schools colleges). 80% still spread virus families home, schools remain closed. agree. hope changes. realistic option one hope gets impeached presidency. want dead. want office US basically entirety r/leopardsatemyface

Why safety nets? racist Aunt Karen hates brown people, stupid realize Obama Muslim matter was. let 312 positive cases TN walk around 30 days given results, fucked  Guess liable hospital bills? That’s another deeply frustrating thing, two make kinds mistakes early pandemic, ultimately pretty good job getting outbreak control. Conservatives tended focus early mistakes, doesn’t help anyone, particularly we’re already really far FL TX outbreaks. virus isn’t going spare Florida nursing homes July Cuomo put positive patients New York nursing homes March. They’re obsessed “winning” argument taking Cuomo/DeBlasio peg they’re unable follow blueprint fixing outbreak *after* it’s already gotten foothold. costs $0 tell roommates sick. Even post perfectly academically supported, still thinly veiled political insult helpful public discourse. Sadly think right. History look back kindly humanity's response virus. anything, virus demonstrated selfish shortsighted human race truly is. imagine reading history textbook fifty years features chapter opening Disney World middle pandemic? grandkids going think completely insane (and wrong). Personally I’m huge fan stimulus checks increased assistance recently due covid, said downside. know ton people college degrees graduated starter jobs laid off. people could find work teleworking company, instead they’re paid unemployment don’t bother trying get new job. It’s finding right balance someone making little enough incentivized find new job, also enough live off. Hard balance Yes, ""Americans stupid"" stereotype made thing.  widespread people go outside supplement. easy fix mean people bother (or even aware). Nothing stopping donating money cause choice. question is, you’re passionate this, aren’t you? Yes, understand cells important. That's reported numbers. irrelevant. Look mortality.
It's cherrypicked. all-cause mortality. cherrypicking done.
You clearly mathematician. Username comment relevance strong mean... would say u guys chose profit healthcare collectively country, u get u chose. beyond that, would little bit hilarious rest world achieves covid herd immunity vaccination look usa still knee deep it. basically ain't seen nothing yet. another two weeks death rate 4th July infections start ramping up. run testing capacity ACCOMPLISHED LET'S GO APPLEBEES.

Yeah, like month ago... why? Lack precautions always WHY. think fair take, Melbourne 5,000,000 citizens hovering around 400 cases day.

This means 0.008% people something infect someone else given day. 

Overall Melbournians / victorians lesser extent remarkably compliant. Part consequence personal freedoms multicultural make cohort difficulty achieving perfect cohesion. 

Without total authoritarianism we're remarkably well. People anxious, exhausted tired. Mistakes get made, even authorities slip up. 

We're still remarkably lucky even chance elimination, government supports us people support efforts stay safe.

It sucks much doubt getting ""better security guards"" would've saved us. long rest world still rampant infections Melbourne Sydney particular always vulnerable, even restrictions place.  20% total deaths NYS nursing homes... fact Cuomo targeted killer elderly following done much worse job disingenuous:

California: 47%

Pennsylvania: 67%

Minnesota: 76%

Oklahoma: 50%

Florida: 48%

Georgia: 44%

Kentucky: 61%

New Hampshire: 82%

Ohio: 56%

source:  mean virus. comes nature, COVID-19 death natural.

The way rattlesnake biting killing shark tearing shreds natural. see why. lot attacks name. ""Biden, hidin'?"" ""Biden, lyin'?"", ""Biden, whiten!"" vaccine coming Oxford.. Infection rate outpacing ability test, backlog growing, number tests able done day constant.

Story checks out. mean say does. Florida life support getting better. count absolute numbers. 6,000 death may sound like nothing compared countries. Sweden 10 million citizens... Germany 9.000 deaths 80 million people living here. That’s 48,000 deaths compared Germany. 
Nope, Sweden didn’t good job. all. - oh ya. 100 million doses something idea effectiveness political PR move Welcome bayes theorem Well least know listens serves him. always knew though, didnt we? think so. probably aren’t talking numbers much that’s many people. compared 160 plus thousand may actually died this. wonder 30-50% False negative False positive rate covid tests attribute approximate 30% increase excess death counts. like Abbott Costello. comments would explain political would right. would also like businesses deny entry people unvaccinated. Schools work too. Imagine Fall Winter everything indoors schools open. Imagine states counties moving Fall already setting record highs. Lol, this. People screaming deaths skyrocket hospitals overwhelmed bodies piling hallways, etc. Still waiting. Big pharma? no, never. Obviously little information make judgement, 11 kids single home pretty interesting story justify. deemed essential, wife severely risk due immunosuppressive disease. cannot take NSAIDS, terrified getting sick due fluoroquinolone toxicity. I'm reading vaccine, may damage body painfully COVID. know do, know what's going happen. first time life, hopeful future. It’s awesome students able benefit that. I’ve able learn lot post-schooling volition, teachers took time make sure solid foundation build upon. 

I’m stating suggesting, wouldn’t worked version existed time learning key things. very, concrete thinker end high school, anything abstract nature, would struggled with.   Fair enough! :) Yeah agree, COVID19 really bring stupids. also think second glance article could crap. death rate people age children still kids, probability parents dying incredibly low. That's I'm saying. cause increased deaths exact scenario wont common. defies odds. scenario happen thousands times.

Edit: probability losing parents using IFR typical age range school age children 8 per BILLION. Kroger added recently, too. key religion kept personal thing people lives, something even close part political judicial policy. Welllllllll article Sweden particular 1/3 (high rent) applies, big cities. 

But yes, young people worldwide almost certainly see similar problems right: worse US worry about. Expect people upset catching COVID deliberately pass on. people care. keep fucking mask TIME.  droplets breathe float air hours. take mask ""breathe little"" aisle alone everyone goes aisle next hour could impacted. 

If totally incapable wearing mask short grocery trip might prudent order groceries get friend family member shop you. websites show large collections poll results tell organizations took polls, ask, comment neither political ""incivil"". Whatever fuck reddit place ass. also put man moon big deal people community start dying. people community dying. still even know anyone sick. work. dealing public day work. Sure, wearing mask work, get struggling with. ok work, big stores open, restaurants open, still one around sick, really risk vector, minds, since home whole time. actually read post, fail comprehend it? $2 trillion? Wow 👀 keep companies afloat? welfare money going people printing money like brrrr meme? find allsides.com good place find less biased news. site make news but, topic, links one article said topic right, one left, one center.

I’m 6’ 157, that’s lean 157. lower back knees definitely hurt far working out, don’t support. Fuck

I try get yoga body weight stuff I’m piece shit. Somehow 3hrs week home harder 15 week before. People seem get hyped worst case scenario's social distancing, virus itself. tested 38 weeks pregnancy. got results 4 days. delivered 39 weeks take covid test again, required hospital gave birth in, they'll
now need put separate covid ward pregnant women.  every article posted one showing ineffectiveness masks several place posted them

Oh good post then. I'd love read them. supplied 72 sources say masks effective. easy reverse right? probably doesn’t know. waiting test result quarantining 2 weeks got unemployment. point really look excess mortality numbers, matter country. Hahaha, statement literally Karen it. Pykvtu5p also called scumbag....what country means nothing.....it's called stand human right thing.... must admit right, took stance recklessly. lashed frustration fact people getting upset actions clearly caught rock hard place, rather outraged outright failure society prevent happening. know excuse me.

I find anecdote rather intriguing.
Maybe super spreader theory - one says people spread all, super spreaders merit. possibility maybe cleared infection asymptomatically without antibody response, cells. IIRC study suggesting common realize, among families one person brings virus home. I'll try find it... really though? Another sensationalized headline. There's literally post right talking cases plateaued there, it? now. safe - whenever may - looking forward visit :) problem alot people waiting 13 plus days major hot spots dont gave enough infrastructure place get tests fast. lifelong New Yorker don’t think ever fully get rage people current virus hotspots laughed us mocked us going hell, instead learning experience preparing. never stopped stupid talking points (“Duh, expect happen subway?” “Cuomo nursing homes!” “Oh, guess virus magically avoids people protesting social justice!”), though one-liners going win arguments argued virus though liberal caller right-wing radio show, they’ve lost debate.

Um.. sorry tell people South continue blame you. See, according them, open early, fine. ""you yankees"" came South vacation infected everybody, even though Republican governors control. Nusing Home Cuomo sent infection another instance Northern aggression South. 

So, according them, Southern states skyrocketing Covid-19 rates still someone else's fault. Specifically Democrats' faults northern states. 

I wish kidding.  woke take health people? Probably mostly fine? Recovered? Job well done. Trump going tweet American hero now? agree Danish authorities overall *amazing* handling pandemic. think one fault. also concerned [recent slight uptick think hey *maybe* could avoided instituting masking indoors policies similar Germany's. 

But think like you: recommend fall wear them. Although may grumble DR's comments Facebook ha! ""Moms get sick days."" Always tough zig rest cult wants zag detracting point racism, lower classes worse place? can't afford lockdown either die virus die starvation. see data points black people lower classes blacks higher classes , mention, lower classes western world likely obese/have health issues, mention lack insurance lack available hospitals. Plus, live cramped housing

However, noted there's link darkness skin severity covid symptoms, however, I'm sure validity can't see data skew results  tax dollars already go corporations churches. small present goes safety net programs. mean already communist country? like human beings everywhere, believe many things obviously untrue.

Guy mince words lol think many people say don’t want people faith democracy. 

Voting matters. Vote every election risk idiots education picking reps. Oh won't. travel agency went bankrupt I'd travelling two people higher risk die. even gone bankrupt, we'd eaten 10k-ish loss anyway. Robots unfurling rolls sod, weeding flowerbeds, watering &amp; raking leaves.  Freedom... stupid employer let work remotely even though tools ability (based job role) so. tell ""I can't work efficiently home plan work 40hrs week home used paid time pay portion it."" reality I'm efficient home stress levels way lower since get 2hrs day back commuting. Meanwhile work wear mask whole duration day annoying shit I'm sitting office myself. online unemployment system? roomie hardly work. She: gets temperature tested daily, always tends average (it’s either natural body temp shit wonky), she’s sent home two weeks pay tests come back negative AGAIN.

She new job now. old job taking care elderly sure missing her. understand precautions, sending people home constantly pay despicable. Sharing ideas progress force everyone path. would allow efficient development different paths. No, race first make lot money. There's many issues testing, I'm saying someone processes them. Methodologies rushed, improper collection techniques, cross containment issues (leaky samples) pcr testing sensitive, etc...

The AB testing beyond useless, unless something changed past month (my department handle longer). Youre moving goalposts. said one would develope medicine, objetively would, time. 

So switch communism straw man. Cmon man game kids shit. believe virus Chinese lab assuming vaccines pass regulatory review. 90% drugs enter phase 3 trials make approval. imagine what's going happen cold/flu season everyone brother symptoms? girl office come heavy cough, right around beginning pandemic. 

She could taken time off, could worked home. Instead came in. 

She's unintelligent person either. smart person working cushy office gig decent size company. 

The work culture US suuucks. morality backwards. Groceries low low-med section. Sure. question whether willing take risk, deal complications, order ensure children get education parents go back work prevent unemployment, depression, poverty - also detrimental health. Ireland, UK, Netherlands Switzerland opted opening schools without limitations (possibly countries I’m unaware of).  Medicine profit, ANYONE rights medicine. can't believe people still this, defending system. Shame you. Damn. We're starting back full time next week state starting get really bad. place hiring? ;) 90 percent papers posted preprints. 

Do keep energy preprints talking antibodies decreasing? 

I bet don’t. 

If not, think might you’re suffering bias? uncommon area. Housing expensive Central Coast region CA probably multiple families undocumented workers share house order make ends meet. That's way always here. restaurant industry, I've never job offered sick leave PTO, I've always worked sick. that's 10% Americans work(ed) field, us option health insurance ACA. 

I honestly wonder we've without society crushing pandemic long, we've begging it. knowwww. going go someone fixed 3 week vacation time (every year close half company first 3 weeks school's holiday half second 3 weeks).

We definitely still go carefully suggested maybe move fall 2022, lol.  long media start saying ackthyually masks dont really work lmao constructive world view. self improvement ""self delusion"". people, yourself. 

Constant negative feedback plays real role mental health. 100% therapists ask address self deprecating suicidal humor, actually real harm. large portion US refuse; due distrust science reason. Actually Switzerland known meager social safety net. comprises 16% total GDP. total government Spending USA social services 18.6%. They're purchasing doses risk case one proven safe efficious approved, go red tape unnecessary time purchase/produce them. entire point producing doses ahead time. called risk guarantee picked benefits vaccine ready outweigh risk.
  
It's Pfizer either, US made similar contract Oxford's vaccine months ago. UK also made contract Pfizer recently countries made deals UK Oxford's vaccine Yeah. Twitter clip went sort viral month ago police officer putting spit mask black guys head cuffing ground.

The caption like ""These racists putting bags heads now! Look injustice!"" 

Unfortunately got lot traction. Stupid twatter. ""Not many"" proportion entire population still going thousands tens thousands families multiple members lost. didnt make news unlikely like said, fact would say likely alot lower income families alot heads household live less safe, crowded conditions, multiple family members get sick once. made news sad gets attention, happening enough seeing articles like pretty much everday now. many still going alot, half family wipped matter days going leave alot people broken. would never mislead anyone anything lol. I’m NY took test week ago. Still results, doctor said they’re averaging 10-day wait due national shortages reagents. outdoor option nice!! someone came home mobile hair salon, would pay double!! fair, although fact didn’t tell anyone didn’t even take precautions household concerning. Social distancing difficult schools open everyone meets outdoors forced indoors due weather. Indoor dining drinking may terrible regions moderate high level infection moving Fall/Winter.

Those countries regions next infection coming Summer far best, economically COVID. definitely won’t sell $200 million plus insider stock trading like Moderna..nope.... back March tested, sure now.  politics everyone knows attacked means. known certain. Theory farmer Kansas got pig bird even both. went cook war. Whaaaat?! 13 days get results? Jesus. wonder guys trouble. say 48 hours Sydney usually it’s like 12-13 hours get results. Easy self isolate day ... Hmmm, yeah Georgia's numbers weird. They've gone deaths stayed relatively flat unlike seeing spiking states. doubt would much better treatment methods would become less deadly there. Covid act put ICU space 97% high. skeptic makes wonder underreporting backlogs hopefully responding better treatment there. detect even cases ? system looks like. seen disadvantages decentralization before.

This true, large part what's gone wrong Sweden system functions; poorly adapted crises. article interesting oversight that. 

However, help matters government (the Prime Minister particular) weak terms standing going in, even weaker behavior crisis wherein basically handed control situaton FHM, run entirely incompetant arrogant technocrats whose mistakes legion (and even predate current crisis, [Tegnell Giesecke really messed badly last well). use eyes noses steady drip fine. 1480 square foot apartment $2200 rent/month (based Zillow's estimate). parent's job keep children safe. really tough kids right lead normal social lives, nobody control virus. schools open sports in-person learning, parent make decision feel right family either keep participating realize strong possibility outcome like family facing. hope family comes okay. issue polled. return person I’d answer okay it, priority workers don’t feel comfortable risk taken care of. don’t mind hybrid model education federal government providing us resources meet CDC standards federal government isn’t allowing parents stay home aren’t supporting aren’t providing funds schools protect communities. many union jobs left. say unions really like HR take money work company reality. strict Catholics Catholics assholes. think comes back previous comment pro control. Similarly narcissism, people care others assume already know best fit others. poor right pass misery along poor people. understand systemic inequality core issue destabilizing whole society- dont get tired weak start punching down. 

Ive poor many people probably think poor still living standard keep. Poor people take 0 personal responsibility day day huge liability around them. please provide source statement?

I quick googling found study, suggests (if I’m reading correctly) it’s 60%- number claim percent make phase 1 approved.  US like 64,000 plus new cases Covid yesterday lack regard science people dealing virus. case countries, many hundreds new cases daily. political post, science. Considering recent reports don’t get lasting immunity, neither herd immunity vaccine help make mistake generalizing world ""humanity"" Americas **Republicans** completely negligent incompetent response.

FTFY That’s scariest thing America maybe even good part world right now.. hometown (small town) rampantly scream FAKE FAKE IT’S MEDIA SPREADING FEAR doesn’t agree agenda. Sadly see sides it’s slippery slope. War next. someone works children already ask several times day put clothes back expect asking keep mask difficult thankful don’t live one [socialist hell holes universal healthcare freedom-crushing wait government!! assume everyone assume I’m around others. It’s probably mentally healthy way live, that’s 2020 ya. per capita India proves point, also make everyone grimace Re-read post carefully. sub take hard anti-lockdown stance? Jesus nobody comments even read article. talking Sweden, one lax lockdowns world, everybody comments plugging ears, downvoting OP, stating “it’s lockdown causing depression virus” explanation think that. 

What’s going on? older family consented adults, still apologize? Peoples shouldn’t shamed seeing loved ones. take much work find address. Atascadero house indeed $2200/month 1480 square feet.

You could fit people comfortably lots midwest. corona bitcoin? cannot know effects lasting longer 7 8 months virus simply existed longer that. way read study covid known cause neurological issues. Nobody implying study reads future covid. Use common sense. things. Yes, infection rate 10x higher, really problem? may end contagious less lethal disease first thought. NY something stop spread, FL nothing even tools experience disposal.

Destroyed economy destroyed lives.

For what?

Even Trump said Florida fucking up. Can’t blame them, live shithole country paid leave safety net. It’s dog eat dog, hey track produce worlds first trillionaire! something proud of, even sacrifice fellow humans grandma get there.

How feel thought experiment? Good China stealing intellectual property could charge vaccine? Seriously?  RemindMe! 106 days dont think ever time open places US without vaccine. 

Saying opened early redundant matter reopen, always spike states never even closed down. seeing PA, completely locked 4 months, super slow phased reopening, seeing spike. electrically charged. isolating awaiting test results makes eligible unemployment, testing centers really informing people this... That'd nuts. [Sweden] 2018, total 17 percent population aged 16 84 stated reduced mental well-being. Among women, proportion 20 percent, corresponding figure among men 14 percent. especially true people aged 16 29. 2018, six percent Italians stated symptoms depression, according study state information site Epicentro.

They list comparisons, arguably quite apples apples enough get sense. ""Reduced mental well being"" =/= moderate severe depression. read actual study yet see better metrics. 

But cross country comparison interesting Italy Sweden similar (30 vs. 32% striking). media sides, leadership, system brainwashed generations, many think shit happens year, dont realize slow process, brainwash, SYSTEM EDUCATION, ECONOMIC, POLITICAL SYSTEM failure, whole world gets see fail. dont alarm others world. saving lives. people going get rich?

[Disclaimer  they're banishing customers refuse wear masks, staff exposed much lower risk allowing people without mask sign waiver. think underestimating many people would self-righteously sign give fuck. 

It would work people give shit finances fiscally responsible, though! Like handful racially culturally homogenous countries Western Europe, sure. look Speaking indoors appear quite risky even across social distancing, may outside spray zone larger droplets, smaller droplets carried artificial air currents people get infected exposed long enough. airborne size droplets smaller contain less virus, statistically speaking would need inhale get infectious dose, masking would recommended even brief interactions indoors never know super-spreader. guys think cases start drop FL, CA, TX etc.? couple weeks away couple months away? Nice source article Tegnell states this? yesterday’s press conference question asked Norwegian reporter much careful wording. really understand whole “flattening curve” thing? Yes people it’s fatal. However asterisk next statement many survived COVID able got proper medical attention. 

So here’s really simple math problem. happens 300 people need ventilators 100 available?

100-300= -200 about-face Soooooo jail right?! math produces odds make statistically unlikely event already happened could happened math probably bad. Totally. It’s people many kids stupid selfish. kids born, kind take care them. know reading sub, one decent thing US Federal Government helicopter-dump money people.

This embarrassment state. Ducey held presser touting incredible amount testing going start release fucking 8,000 tests possibly 100,000 backlogged places 12-day turnaround times results? ridiculous. 72-96 hours turnaround unacceptable deep in, 12 days fucking joke. symptoms.

Thank dropping knowledge me! Honestly clue.. sorry asshole it.. kudos *not* stooping level instead proving wrong facts! Scary facts though, ugh :/ wife cannot take vaccine medical concerns, reason it’s important many people get vaccine (true herd immunity). many immunocompromised people live like full-time, reason anti-vaxxers dangerous. valid reasons wearing mask, stated CDC

- age 2
- unconscious/incapacitated
- physically unable remove mask without assistance. 

if lift hands face, you’re awake, there’s excuse There’s comforting myth tell age comes wisdom, though it’s self-evident truth. Wisdom comes life experience, age *often*comes life experience, always. people piss away fruits life living small unchallenged existences, grow old without wisdom. article say provide many clues, likely Hispanic household. Hispanics likely live multi-generational households helps explain would disproportionately infected disease.

Especially since legally, morally, ethically possibly even physically, way he's leaving Whitehouse unless he's forced.  Im guessing gonna pivot towards claiming ""I've always said masks work. I've always said masks worn. Etc etc evil msm took context!"" good media coverage AZ issues. cases less testing, good itself. hospitalizations today, looks promising! AZ lost grip contact tracing, think last week least momentarily got back. AZ's problem Phoenix surrounding suburbs, metro area cooperate, AZ's numbers inevitably follow. 

Florida really trending downward yet. unusual spike cases 7/12. Remove day, maybe levelling still climbing. Texas reaching new heights hospitalizations, cases need level longer know Texas peaking. 

I think overall, COVID news hit home, easy ignore. literally know someone COVID yet. (I live one two states shut New York did. governor done well.) people take license situations, less mask usage, going parties, etc. sister law feeling miserable, coworker's mom died, maybe take notice. AZ, FL, TX, would think people less 3 degrees away one person COVID. probably mask go less. That's like saying poverty choice, could choose poor. know, best save money move Midwest caught COVID. Boris Johnson’s rat piece shit didn’t learn anything getting virus. refusing give living wages NHS. I’m shocked support spitting people saved life. know happened CA. virus got CA NY, Gavin Newsom excellent job locking controlling it. People good job following directives. 

Now set worse NY. 

Maybe true that, despite good leadership is, noble intentions, people simply literally cannot physically lock couple months? Horrible! put jail attempted murder. scumbag! yet somehow commandeer masks PPE states hospitals ordered, purchase mass amounts unproven drugs push use, order CDC report data. may person charge deeming safe power means pressure person, fire people finds one incompetent enough so. doesn’t disprove racism. poor white folks. might even poor white folks poor black folks. white folks black folks country. that’s fair honest comparison. need look averages, control things like differences population size.

When that, see black families less wealth average. Black families less likely homes, stocks, etc. ghost racism past. systematically extracted wealth black people centuries. result, black people *tend to* less wealth white people.

Lastly, seem thinking racism exclusively personal failing. It’s something rooted finding Last True Klansman. It’s baked sorts trends, assumptions, patterns behavior. 

It’s present mortgages higher rates black people. justified “risk” result exploitation talked earlier. black people likely economic distress, they’re likely risky loan to. There’s nothing explicitly racist condemnable that. makes sense. nevertheless, leads different outcomes black people average white people. difference racialized. 

Issues like exist medicine, article, well business, law, justice system, etc. people mean talk institutionalized systemic racism. It’s institutions systems society, necessarily individuals, perpetuate racist outcomes. Addressing racism individual level ALWAYS going fail address systems incentives create disparate outcomes based skin color. again, reading comprehension. said all, glad laugh lack reading skills think speak next time. Hold phone. idea vaccines prove effective enough release. thats news, weve talking 33 % fucking retarded morons months now. Fuck stagnant wages skyrocketing housing costs give people option live 16 people. I’m one pay 100% earning, it’s hell lot $600. seems really unfair make hell lot less $600 week. 🤝 That's test much. Bigly. What, that's one Tulsa Oklahoma. gone, people dead. biggie right?

And that's also remembering people even get flu particular year, one much contagious, let run rampant far people would catch it. piece shit...yet time people weren’t struggling financially probably wouldn’t issue. ever Florida August? mandated start stay-in-place order back March. Imagine could right happened. Yes, virology engineering/astrophysics thing /s Awesome. Good you. literally says unable keep 6 feet. would mask outdoors it’s crowded? It’s way Michigan  True - UK, Spain, Italy massively justflattened curve, crushed mcuh lower numbers. spike US cases happening right now, insane. 

Now, there's 10-20 day lag onset death, expect death toll rise steadily next weeks, beat Europeans. Except all. Honestly cannot believe people still making absurd argument. Compare Sweden neighbors actually countries similar them, meaning demographically, geographically, culturally, economically, climate wise, healthcare system, population health, etc. Sweden 561 deaths per million. Compare Norway (47), Finland (59), Denmark (105, since connected mainland Europe). 12x, 10x, 5x increases comparable neighbors. Utter insanity call success comparison.

Now imagine zero restrictions approach US given enormous differences Sweden. Hell, even matched per capita fatality rate would put us 186,000 fatalities. add significantly worse healthcare system, far higher population density several dozens cities, worse population health, varying climates, massive economic disparities you’d recipe freaking holocaust. wonder pick choose virus attacked outdoor weddings outdoor protests. Hmm. Hmm. 🤔 

Maybe protestors wore masks? Outdoor weddings attendants typically don't. 

Are really obtuse? Trying make facts fit narrative never works well.  Yeah, I'll let someone else play lab rat official vaccine President ""Shove lightbulb ass mainline bleach"", thanks. Victim blaming. even hear yourself? Victims what? sex without protection? Victims parents bringing kids world afford? people victims perpetrators crime offspring. 1 million per day 2 weeks then. Per capita means per head. There's thing per head capita. given backup beginning. covid death bump several times higher flu deaths last five years combined. Multiply ten full mitigation scenario estimate covid would comparable maybe 50-100 years flu.

But that's total deaths, individual mortality, course know covid biggest problem contagiousness- whereas flu guess many it. common cite 0.1% IFR flu, number cannot right - would tens thousands flu deaths every year, years almost none. I'm sure, I'm guessing administrative reporting time. may able run tests within 1-3 days, takes time report out. they'll proritize reporting positive results.

Here's example timeline covid test:

Day 1: get swabbed health provider. Sent county lab

Day 2: county runs test

...

Day 8: County faxes result back health provider. Patient informed health provider. know person become blind eye corona, dont ask how. Wat.

AFAICT, nicotine may prevent it, **smoking** definitely exacerbates (if get it). not? Smoke irritates lung, matter slice it. Like miracle. tf infect everyone household theres 16 you? recall correctly, reports least three (3) idle factories, fully set equipped make N95 masks, owners offered start up. wanted government buy products, instead company taking financial risk. US government, declined. 

Here one reports:  Apparently :) issues sentence too, want bother rereading it, wans't double blind, placebo controlled, etc sure  believe it. I’ve never tested back January daughter went Seattle shopping, week later got hit cold like I’ve never before. like 6th time 2019 daughter cold. cold knocked ass almost two weeks, body hurt bad. heart felt like going burst chest, 101 degree fever days chest cold/cough. daughter mild symptoms, cough anything. slight fever days. husband didn’t get sick, 1 year old dry cough weeks never symptoms. thought teething.. didn’t know covid.. weeks March went lock down.

We probably spread hundreds people, knowing whatever thankfully didn’t mental stress knowing people today. think spreading weeks first case found. also believe way people don’t symptoms like husband.

My point since cold, diarrhea 3 months. I’ve noticed weird things vision, things aren’t there, move side eye. get random headaches never before. get sleepy sometimes can’t stay awake. week sleeping 12hrs day. forget things called. also heart palpitations now, didn’t before. knows really. bet we’re millions higher reported. groceries stores able pick still able pay ebt. Im saying really isnt difficult make changes. ""That kill makes stronger"" referring mental fortitude, physically stronger. mesh overwhelmed ICUs, though?

Great question (hopefully someone else downvoted BTW haha)

Simply put, narrative around overwhelmed ICUs that, narrative. undeniably see/saw instances local ICU hitting capacity, problem solved shuffling patients nearby ICU/hospital capacity.

I recently went extensive detail maybe take look risk repeating much? Yeah, they're saying actual number infected higher number confirmed cases. cite CDC saying 10x actual cases confirmed cases.

I think 10x CDC estimate bit high California, testing decent. [machine learning estimates true total number infected cases California (recovered current) 3 million. would ratio 1:7.5 confirmed:total cases. Graphic Designer here... need know web developer, web designer, print designer, illustrator, motion designer, video editor, special effects editor, social media manager... 

asking 1 person literally 7 jobs garbage pay insane. Even high pay amount work 1 person crazy unreasonable wife's entire family (4 cousins, grandma, uncle, 2 aunts) Pittsburgh tested positive 12 days ago.

It spread wife's 26 year old cousins girlfriend. sister brought SC 4 5 people contact tested positive.

This lines officials saying teens 20 somethinys primary spreaders. That's infiltrated wife's family.

Most longer symptoms except uncle asthmatic (he ok, yet) Yeah guess Kardashians make big bucks TV, is, however, high percentage customers although get news, behaving badly. behaving badly enough endanger safety around making workers feel threatened. see many day large establishment. Locale, type retailer, etc. could cause variation. like hope among worst. That's postulated reason article. actually shown cause. Someone really examine whether occasional children die vaccinated MMR. data USS Roosevelt well prison data suggest MMR may provide boost innate immune system may protect COVID. uncommon tragedies, ones young die, may hold answers would help us save countless others. it’s 6 times worse flu it’s really bad lmao can’t dirty little liar title post misleading. antibodies mean infected, exposed MAY infected. anything, demonstrates many people asymptomatic symptomatic.

Stupid Americans pretty big reason. one knows anything people’s situation except there’s arrogant asshat reddit making assumptions victim-blaming victims made-up fantasy scenario good measure. Nobody said that, always argue ghosts mind? good reason people still spending time instead exploring options *haven't* consistently shown particularly helpful? glib, I'm genuinely wondering still researched urgent. going down, 10 listed today. Norway never go thru lot deaths achieve numbers.   think statement like fair say. Sure, given current capabilities virus never eradicated, however know innovations come pass future. could nanobots programmed obliterate manner pathogens someday, maybe happen. also possible develop ways allow want prevent COVID infections protect without requiring others take protections. Ohhh yeah, tell!! I'm research beyond Reddit, worry lol. hard find unbiased sources, even exist. I'm trying take everything form opinions. Remember 2% US population 6.6 million people... right 10x number Americans died combat entire history country. 

Or 2,204x number people perished 9/11 attacks. 9/11 attack every day Aug 4th, 2026 match death toll.

That said, hopefully death rate meaningfully 2%. Likely closer 1%, hard say. happens everywhere. people may stupid dumb. seeing half year's worth dead within couple months incentivizes protect ways. live bible belt US, people think hoax, nothing ploy let one side win election etc etc go walmart evening big increase numbers, see lot masks days. almost like ""couldn't hurt"" argument come full circle. mean use gym now? people saying take vaccine right away. think want it, able get it. Except, last looked newer info, time show symptoms already contagious... Beayoootiful, HEALTHY, Green Tobacco!  Also getting earlier usually wont give immunity whole season best time sept-oct one reason available doctors offices. never available mid sept Ive lived different regions.

So somehow, surprised slightest. 10,000 day , imagine doubled testing got faster results. would imagine 20 thousand day easily.  Inddor, could see.

But going outdoor gets challenged. NJ people, even approved mandated indoors, question outdoor portion this. I'm sure many Ohio going question outdoor mask mandates really necessary. Well...yeah think might who's mostly responsible haha respect ability weigh facts change mind! No, Texas hospitals look like charnel houses. War zones would marked improvement.

Wearing mask something almost everyone easily force stay home, lose job, business go bankrupt. confusing seems opposition simply wearing mask effectively everyone house arrest. Go watch videos footage protests. things damn near 100% masked. went several protests, one admittedly *only* person masked forgot mine. 

People bars, weddings, church gatherings, beaches, outdoor parties never wearing masks high enough percentage prevent spread. know butthurt BLM protests lead spikes, that's truth whether like not.

I like also explicitly deliberately ignored 21 states housing meets surpasses demand “because nobody wants live Ohio” (paraphrasing). Like people literally never move pursue opportunities.

However, say times recently predominantly black latino areas, seen lot people wearing masks (even inside), socializing big groups, even passing around hookahs, sort thing. area people general taking masks social distancing seriously. It’s pretty stark contrast I’ve seen predominantly white areas live. never ""over"" everyone get vaccine. forgot:

* teaching general cost
* depiction violence lived violence (most non-US people feel safer walk streets random African city streets New York)
* depiction sex
* gender wars
* racism, sexism forms inequality (you guys still black ghettos??)
* poor median income people compared median income people poor countries
* health care, cost bound job, thus chaining people employer (aka slavery)
* social (in)security general (how fuck many homeless people sleeping streets major cities?)

There many more, came mind Y'awl dying alarming rate. I've seen is, understanding virus developed, rules. People take changes ""they understand they're doing!!!"" No, know X yesterday, they're acting X.

Just wear masks yesterday, mean wear today. We're late, that's whole matter late. quarantine best living arrangements pre-COVID 16 people? So, one advocates masks chasing people dont wear one mind business away you? C'mon, can't possibly think there's movement push anything like score toxicity. Point went way head.

^(Everyone dies.) election officer Virginia June 23's primaries, talk election day:

* changed procedure checking IDs touch item belonging voter. Basically place ID box table would take box check ID there, without touching it. means use ID scanner, process bit slower usual.
* Masks gloves mandatory us. Virginia mandates masks, told encouraged necessary voters use one. \~300 people voted day one entered without mask.
* Voting booths half usual number, plenty distance them. challenging general election. Also, booth disinfected every single voter.
* eight voters allowed inside building one time. easy since turnout low.

Sheeple God damn Steven. ""European"" strain we've heard before

Yes mean couldn't. simply means enough people get vaccinated. think flu shot sub 10% countries?

Imagine mandatory vaccinations Corona, everyone gets (Who healthy enough get it, obviously). virus would pretty much die time (Sure, might still dozen cases around, everyone immune response can't spread anymore). pharmaceutical company work bunch contract research/clinical trial testing Pfizer sounds like going *very* well I'd temper tempered expectations...but like, mildly excited direction. r/trashy delay inevitable. Beijing starting see rise cases Spain blowing country locked hell lot longer US.

It’s bad America consumer spending huge driver economy. Bars restaurants needed open back make money feed workers’ families cater subset population really doesn’t give shit anything willing ignore risks virus.

With said, extended lockdown USA would made things far worse much business closures, poverty, massive disruptions food supply chain. smart ? feel trump leader finally wore mask ?  article 2011 OFFS, 3 kids wife middle school teacher. still go it. worried asshats, genpop. look, need push deal china need whole gravity debacle sound like may mistake - trump

He'll inside bit. you’re right NYC data showing high IFR. also explains higher quality NYC’s data suggests mortality risk elsewhere U.S. may even higher. :(

I strongly suspect NYC (and everywhere world Feb-April), infection rate nursing homes considerably higher general population. would boost IFR outbreak substantially, mortality high.

It might accurate look IFR outside nursing homes. nursing home mortality high possible conclusion cannot let nursing homes. Unfortunately fail again, numbers going go two places best data AFAICT. Spoiler alert: fine Maybe call doctor take medical advice me, layman internet?

People usually around 95-99%. 92% could mean error device used. could done exercise. would worry 90%. also, again. I'm dude internet.

Yes, millennials killing another industry. (-: covid situation netherlands nowadays? better? people still wear masks maintain social distancing? They're focusing genetics missing main point.

Viruses bacteria (including bacteria gut), adapt host, want kill host, want live them.

Bats basal body temperature 39 C, they're overheated exertion flying reach 42 c).

The viruses survive outer part bat, get incinerated enter bat's organs get fried temperature.

But human basal body temperature 37 C. means even fever (39 C) virus can't killed bat viruses evolved survive 39C (and get killed higher temps inside bat's organs).

That's viruses jumping bats deadly, whereas viruses trying jump fish (basal body temperate 30 C) easily boiled death blood.  I'm responsible COVID-19 protocol job statistics are:


- 15% symptoms 

- 70% less difficult flu

""When go back normal?"" know?! Depends society it?

Your average doctor busy person, particularly now, know everything virus existed less year, epidemiologists.

And yes, know frustrating - live seemingly untreatable debilitating chronic illness least 3 years now, ought put shoes help prevent frustration unreasonable expectations. article indicated was, government, I'm sure bailout kind anyway. teachers incompetent children stupid.

No, reopening, suggest requiring masks impossible silly. narrative math trumps politics. clearly following that. might either. honestly, i'm sure do, alternative never get use excuse ""not you"" anymore. Nobody knows. happened yet. could still happen, one day next.

Even 100% sure would mutate harmless.. be? 2021? 2022? 2030? meantime people die. better stay home, wear mask, wash hands, distance get vaccine proven. Yeah, think going long time, ever, clear picture many people actually infected first weeks outbreak New York.

Testing California right perfect, hell lot thorough New York March.   defend can't defend themselves...

Republicans: ""Fuck you, got mine."" France: New cases 998.

USA: New cases 64,500.

Hmm. younger group. 3rd 4th economic recession/ depression. I've experienced fucking horrible things even turn 30. I've basically already accepted future fucked, chance getting home pretty much over, may chance retire, really world possible retire in. background environment, climate change politics. Looking future fucking grim. However getting disease control fully means fully fucked further. actual lock 4-8 weeks seem lesser two evils all, possibly another one second wave eventually hits. Vaccine production distribution massive scale probably going happen another year. virus want catch chance keep going long things continually get worse, side effects life changing beyond nasty. I'm watching friends live collapse slow motion, lock downs contagion control restrictions time tested method fighting something like this. I've accepted looked handled past. Well actually amount land no. It’s places people. California New York like half entire country they’re leftist. even knew teacher would talk infinite genders sexualities fucking 6th graders. surprised upstairs neighbor 24 people living there. original couple man's sister move 3 kids , another sister brother law 4 kids, another sister husband another 4 kids. womans sister kids . brother girlfriend. apartment upstairs. loud chaotic. get cultures living together thing toooo much. believe 100's thousands protests helped cause surge, I'm certain see millions going bars restaurants scales even harder. incentivizes protect ways

Right, specifically Swedes currently currently successful causing downward trend? 5 months later must care much cult following balancing risk coronavirus risk businesses failing people depressed isolation. personally could stay home 2 years fine. people get really depressed. missing point. I'm comparing, I'm saying due mismanagement, even universal healthcare fail. short answer Yes!  feel likely prioritize based hotspots major economy hubs. 'normal' time ultrawelathy likely risk infection due hyper-mobile. also present greatest risk increasing geographical areas infection reason. 

Personally would vaccinate healthcare workers, essential employees, business travelers reopening industries (this probably 50million less), focus vulnerable populations elderly urban poor (due lack ability socially distance)

If target people likely spread, also protect people likely spread to. places like assisted living, workers vaccinated continuing limited visits months worth getting economy going sooner. $600 much, companies paid people livable wage, issue. Cmon now... least Iowa. governor alcoholic ass-kisser know good decision bottom bottle black velvet. Well, fuck. tested ended 92%. RIP me. 10 listed today. 

Where find number? think heard somewhere reason Asians wear masks SARS.

I think covid-19 going causes cultural shift West. Facemasks eventually going widely accepted covid-19 affects enough people directly. chronic fatigue years now, stay safe take chances. takes one screw up, right fear it. Brain fog fucking suckssss Yeah point wouldn’t surprised reality Drinking water issue Africa bribery reasons lack trying. say vaccine would see different outcome, invalidate effectiveness vaccine. Travel bans would pretty readily contain virus continent infrastructure changes possible. classes outdoors there. restaurants, leave name, time visit telephone number, notify something comes up. 

The pub went last two weekends Bundesliga chairs upside taped table let know, ""don't sit here"".

The tables could sit number record table number contact info sheet too. fact, virus caused 1918 pandemic, H1N1, also never went away. changed mutated flu viruses, original H1N1 virus still us. immunity, flu shots, genetic resistance, it’s manageable (usually). 

Coronavirus likely going like common cold, closest relative. may tempered immunity fact people genetically disposed die die it, it’s impossible get rid virus completely without strong immune response vaccine (like smallpox) massive collaborative multi-decades effort. People idea much things cost anymore. used make 10 hour grandparents thought rich without morphine, heard allow video chats quite limited patients abilities. Wow even considered autoimmune disease. That's terrifying thought seems plausible. know girl autoimmune disease (since birth) immune system attacks lungs. Sounds relevant...

All reason people WEAR GODDAMN MASK STAY HOME. That’s kind problem antagonist amongst us. let get away things it’s easier less confrontational cave move on. emboldens escalate get want. 

Not sure fix also dangerous people others. Social justice equality isn’t essential pandemic?

Including China. Maybe respect citizens repressive laws world could innovate own. allow say anything negative government keep mental level children.So see either Chinese least understand support them. limited admission policy helps less people catch sick ones. Sometimes policies completely stop transmission, keep R0 low. did. 

I asked spike.

No one denies increase factor ever many new infections. 

Your changing tune clear it’s growing slowly. 

Your spike late coming. 

Whatever then. True Wow. Mission Accomplished. think, needed new data reporting system. Fuck masks. Gov go get apology??? Donald Trump's reaction speed faster Internet Explorer least. Despite late twenties working risk groups still get flu shot every year.

And every time hear ""But wrong strain? useless!""

So if? Even totally miss right strain (which past), still get immunity boost 20-30%. much, something.

It's minor discomfort, tiny prick, maybe slightly swollen arm night that's it. might protect one two weeks absolutely miserable (with health implications also risk infecting others). President Trump said people wearing masks signaling disapproval him, presto, became political         
Now, he's pickle even party telling mask wearing best way salvage reopenings, *only* way.   
Trump always two months late. squandered late Jan early March. Then, became ""wartime"" president."" Then, bleach fiasco, took 2 month hiatus. Johnny-on-the-spot back saying, wear mask. Nope. Emotions powerful things. Vengeance perceived injustices among powerful motivations.

It takes strong social inhibitions prevent sorts responses. think matter time anti-mask nut goes larger killing spree U.S. one reason I'm glad I'm essential worker. give dirty glances walk away... It’s almost like aren’t good solutions virus widespread, best ways protect **economy** would’ve to:

1. Keep early aggressive quarantine,

2. Lockdown first sign cases area use epidemiology models contact tracing control it,

3. Early, consistent public education basis common sense shit like wearing masks. 

You know, exactly entire public health community saying along. test covid-19 virus nasal passage. 

They're consistent positive results, tend lot false negatives myriad reasons, ranging lack trained personnel, difficulty performing test correctly, pressure, (unconfirmed) virus moves around lot might body moved away particular spot. 

We're also cautious positive results, leading potentially unnecessarily long hospitalisations because... really know long contagious for, new all. year so, safely say 'you're positive keep eye xyz, X amount time see family'. Right now, soon assume we'd rather play safe sorry. low $100 week some...     That’s level intelligence you’re dealing America Beyond Blunderdome expect stay home rest life. That’s fine me, raise daughter live together forever. feel bad people without spouses children, live alone forever.

Edit: [found state superintendent. “Cases per day” artifact testing. Daily deaths peaked April 12-14, suggest peak spread infection mid-March. fact, hospitalization death curve suggests community spread significant late February early March, significantly higher Nordic countries. Sweden implemented recommendations around time European countries (March 11-April 1), rate infection went pretty efficiently on. Deaths following ~3 weeks unfortunately already “built in”. 

The slower decline infection death European countries probably consequence lighter restrictions countries implemented. 

You could argue Sweden “late” implementing recommendations restrictions, probably would several weeks earlier see results nordics, point one knew significant community spread was. Hindsight 20/20. learned lesson Socrates..... educating people skill voting properly gonna write long reply I'll settle this.

Yup.... fucking hate here. You’re also discounting people poor buy several weeks advance Australia someone workplace tests positive, isolate whole staff isolation (and thier families) disinfect whole store....

I'm saying South Korea cheating, shows hard find cases likely even countries low level infection significant amount cases go undetected. remember opposite true weeks ago Cambodia reported zero active cases, Thailand/Vietnam reported cases arriving Cambodia.

And beginning pandemic cases found Norway travellers arriving Austria Austria reported total domestically.

It's also similar significant amount celebrities testing positive. Look list Covid-19 deaths Wikipedia. There's suspect high amount politicians celebrities African countries list, well South Asia compared many cases report. Denmark reports 20-30 cases day, two footballers highest division (a weeks ago though). People shielded individuals society. we're #1 destination immigration world, right? terrible people STILL flocking droves, millions, even Trump President. 

As someone lives state/city extremely high illegal immigration, whole story reeks multiple families lives undocumented. mention many employees.

Honest god question I’m smartest cookie. understand impeachment investigation crime remove president. isn’t isn’t system people call elected official removal vote?

Edit: understand 4 years. scenario majority people disagree blatantly obvious disregard human lives ethics, emergency removal? Let’s revive magical word called “context.”

The United States world’s largest economy. Specifically, nation deals extensively China, largest link supply chain passes US onto rest world. 

Californian ports import bulk arrangement, export massive amount agricultural products back China. 

I demonizing China arguing Trump administration’s nationalist protectionism. That’s another discussion. 

What trying point rest world uses US intermediary, mostly finished goods. hard believe (myself included), US manufactures creates astounding array economic goods global supply chain. don’t manufacture lesser goods like textiles zero-skill industries anymore. 

This means unfortunately exposed nature economy. one else will. Europe’s tech industry “sue Google”, Canada suffers brain drain best brightest choose live work jobsjobs pay better, Central South America many domestic problems they’re trying get (which mostly fault). 

The last thing want point shit US gets, country reports figures realm trustworthy, whether economic otherwise. lie like everyone else, course. leave US, accountability drops tremendously. 

Could handled better? No, actually, particular virus common cold. Viral pathogens like coronavirus cannot stopped. spreads like wildfire, VLPs nearly three magnitudes smaller pores mask. 

Combine factors, see ruthless evolution viral pathogens combined place global economy presents logistics problem complex risk. really shouldn’t allowed. I'm saying leader united states america saying masks optional. Fauci saying masks work? player still evolution points left, careful wave wave slowly drifting true, don’t think counts household definition right? Thank Trump GOP this. blame rests entirely profits people policies. I'd rather die freedom. Wish granted. Come NJ hear constantly. Guy work yelled Canadian cousin died waiting 6 months Canada sort treatment forget adamant he’d alive. I’d give hear constantly reason original post deleted fro political. explaining hear daily basis apparently that’s allowed Look replies. different datasets sets NY 435k, thats looking at.

Overall agree CA, TX FL overtake NY. *The art war* 1000 deaths yesterday fucking sack shit.

These people got infected weeks ago, thousand dead. like told over. There's growing mountain evidence people talking politician's religion positive, they're meaning ""I think he's good person.""  


They mean ""He'll asshole people also dislike."" fuck usa Highscore!! Doubt comment even seen got positive test results back spoke department health gave comprehensive list contact tracing, 10 people actually lot believe not. week dept began contacting people listed, received basically hardcore scrutiny. Best friends even cousin mine basically like “what going work next 2 weeks?”

Trust me, even though contact tracing part solution, don’t think won’t catch world shit it.

When explained “you know right thing do, right?” basically met random assortment political responses didn’t make sense me. Oh well, fuck everyone. way, everyone listed family best friends. get death penalty please? 16-11 = 5, hol up, something isn’t communist china quarterback phrase gentle way saying public health policy ideas sound exactly like come someone formal training subject, relevant experience, ultimately affected much. bet voted Trump it’s like open religion.

You point Trump really play shit needs get gullible morons side. large amount [prosperity gospel pretty much declared 2nd coming. making profit pandemic indeed immoral, especially government helped fund research. logic says must bad, right? closed space limited ventilation people stuck other's germs circulating air hours end. perhaps industry somehow forced people flying take lots precautions? also possible infections detected many days later immediately connected flight? sounds likely unlikely different perspectives. That's fine. plan getting tested barely tested shity vaccine make things worse. I'm fine limiting activities. I'll wait till shitt show's
 over. least wear mask results come back. even nj 11 days according people posting subreddit waiting results chosen job paid sick leave. 

😐 That’s villages, I’ve heard they’ve started getting coronavirus positive cases, they’ll probably badly hit place don’t take drastic action Sigh. Literal survivorship bias. thought well. muh freedom  long deal corpses, right. soon they're ones dead bodies block, becomes national emergency. That's less knowledge available back then.

One thing drastically reduced death rates knowing Covid19 infections cause blood clots, deadly hit wrong places. Blood thinning medication prevent blood clots produced large quantities, given hospitalised Covid19 patients. drastically reduced death rate.

If want proper comparison, compare France New York state, since main outbreak time. France 3.5 times population New York, similar amount Covid19 deaths. France much better regard. making right decision. hope rest pregnancy goes smoothly parents respect enough stay away. Much love.  Cool, maybe Karens Chads start listening US almighty spoken I’m thinking, possible motive would every state world deliberately exaggerate number deaths? doesn’t make sense, even conspiracy theory. 'Cul de sac' expression english speaker use ? might misunderstanding implications here, even disregarding t-cells etcetera, sounds like manageable length time build recurring vaccine schedule around, especially since vaccines usually developed evoke bigger antibody response catching virus would be? 

I impression point expecting covid likely become endemic either way, that, vaccinated regularly like flu is, doesn’t big deal longer term.

Is accurate? doesn’t sound like bad news so! reading yesterday many days took cases go 2 million, 3 million, 4 million. lot people saying tired can't take anymore. think obvious control.  think people careful you, country would much better shape Ew, pay test? Thats exploitative disgusting imo believe that's ""official"" numbers. Also start taking vitamin d. I'm low carb, weight loss stalled started taking again. no. easier government intentionally broken, without systemic corruption citizens well priority.  California fair, we’re 5 months shouldn’t prioritizing gets tested. everyone country tested. state governments power decide much restrictions state.

It's noted times correlation easing Stage 3 restrictions rise cases. 

That necessarily mean government blame correlation. 

I've heard people suggest relaxing restrictions leads people becoming complacent restrictions suggest think unwise Victoria ease restrictions quickly. trying lift around time states nearly eliminated virus.

I agree Victorian government bears responsibility think blaming irresponsible oversimplifies situation.

We need take responsibility actions well. assuming people quarantine without losing jobs US. can't. hell even take long? got results within 1 day country, barely *any* capacity shit got started.

I guess shows priorities ruling class US. first week July free testing covid sites closed kind revamp. next week booked, couldn’t get even tested 2 whole weeks wait results knows much time. go pay even takes 6 business day. Guess holiday perfect time right /s Yeah! exact thoughts. even listed reasoning choice either Thank you. great morning. Assuming everyone literally universal precaution means. Updated info NPR: ""In statement early Wednesday, State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said: ""We directed closure [People's Republic China] Consulate General Houston, order protect American intellectual property American's (sic) private oh gosh like talking wall. Good luck delusional might true new normal, I’m sure now. It’s basically impossible meet single people. genuinely prefer alone, time, rest life. I’m sure people like that, nearly many think. people want sex least one time die, example. 

I’m sure unmarried people start feel lonely years go by.

And clear, I’m including long term partners definition “married” regardless whether you’re legally married.

Jail mean Labs allowed improve testing? someone preventing I’m feeling really hopeless virus today. family high risk- long need stay home? always worried losing parents virus around? makes sick stomach. Wow, that’s interesting thought. lol call chona virus?

Edit: ah saying China virus. swear sounds like Chona  full shit.   

Themos-cow-times ... might onto something Gyms, bars, restaurants three least safe places be, ☠️ would strange really necessary. Pooled testing value there's cases reported, catch spread low, keep way.

My understanding value - 20 people think it, pool test those. positive result... clear 20 1 test 20. positive split group retest samples see...one pos one neg....then 10/20 clear. Retest 10...and forth til find positive. eliminated 10 people example 2 tests...or 20 one positive. needs something else, point, pushing masks he's got left. 

I mean could actually use power federal government combat virus. Recommending masks literally least could do, thing left long shot. Today specifically said press conference soldier guess Oslo Accords say think say.

that biggest betrayal Palestinians corrupt disgusting leadership PLO Arrafat put personal interest ego top well people end paying it. probably better finding another person engages low risk activity making regular partner. Everywhere world, including China, believes infections deaths higher stated.

Meanwhile USA, champion Chaos god Ignorance, believe infections deaths overblown. Australia. facing second wave tho...started Melbourne, biggest spike recorded last 24 hours.

WHY?

Because fucktards care whole.

I hate fucking planet sometimes think trump would care latter?  Vote ranked choice voting then. Oh know. Wait? takeaway here?

It's leaders, stupid people? post really confusing - unless wanted say. kinda wrong. Please feel free correct me. shit, Sherlock! used time machine, duh! Yes agree mostly. 

But never much sex education school parents still found way educate protect made decision sex. 

In day age, uneducated anything hard thing excused choice. wealth knowledge finger tips. even poverty line access internet situations days. numbers can't get access education, especially topic sex, likely small. Trump made political called hoax. jail mass homicide people argue imagine people repeat narrative hear favourite news source, politician etc point believe care point is, know people share similar views topics (probably damn immigrants) dislike universal healthcare. therefore must course it, even though there's really negatives plethora positives. Even live country free healthcare, there's plenty private options sometimes work perk. Compassion would whatever takes stop virus spreading. Anything else putting perfume stinky pig. I'm advocating stopping virus getting country back track - please, explain compassion 140,000 dead Americans. I'm sure totally understand weeks staying home far much ask. neither choice right country? want Joe Biden president, fuck bad Trump like you.  China way better tools deal US ever will. able quell easily comparison letting get control first place, due little gave shit people's freedoms. US government even power barricade people homes suspected contact covid power trace people virus without compliance due privacy laws, power get involved state level degree. end, state handle individually infrastructure handle due direct access federal funding. federal government even resources put 50 separate fires degree ridiculously low traceability. 

I'm pretty sure China directly fault believe deserve take major hit this. Would want keep good business country chose allow thousands citizens die, mention billions around world, attempt save face, endangering hundreds thousands, millions, deciding something admit screwed up. finally got control, far know none us live there, watching world burn allow things get worse due stopping things earlier, letting spread country, taking advantage situation try place pressure countries resources quell pandemic time need, well cases SELLING aid pandemic form faulty covid tests.  also insane work let go in. got tested breathing problems. live parents. dad told come confirmed don’t it, even though according doctor highly unlikely positive. took 5 days get results, I’m New Jersey.  Certain businesses won’t ever recover. time soon. little catering hall venue it’s almost unreasonable expecting people congregate like use to. 

As far buffets go, it’s gonna least year covid controlled even lifetime skepticism following.

New Zealand Taiwan eradicated virus early, strong response. Taiwan total 7 deaths form this, New Zealand 22 deaths total. Taiwan even lock properly caught early. doubt mask use there, create DOUBT mask use USA? saying never eradicated? eradication option never presented, never discussed, never even considered possibility, despite 3 countries less eradicated virus. take 8 week war like effort, eradication possibility. present ""flatten curve"" argument, without even mentioning eradication? Flatten curve dangerous thing say, motivating enough get people stay home. Elimination eradication real possibilities get people stay home actually commit proper lock down. started proper lock March virus would eradicated mid-end April, record cases control community spread.

It proves enough money make people want kill economy.  measure flu like measure Covid. CDC estimates number infections based number hospitalizations doctor's visits, estimates number deaths based excess mortality. 

No time human history counted cases deaths virus religously. he's still alive

Lol okay. Bet US hacking try steal vaccine research too.  link say think says. 2 things going antibody tests. One, early pandemic, FDA let manufacturers sell unproven tests. Many bad. might still there, FDA approved tests reputable lab (like Quest LabCorp) using. 

These \~99% specificity, pretty good. means 1 false positive 100 tests. get ""positive results wrong half time"" 1% population actually antibodies - odds testing positive tiny odds getting false positive.

But test right 98% tested negative, prevalence community increases, confidence positive result. example, population gets 10% antibodies, positive result 90% chance real instead false. test get accurate, odds getting real positive result larger small odds getting false positive. let guess, say this, believe god.

How often often? Nobody would care 0.01% time, it’s 50% time huge deal. don’t specify hope pay American. It’s Canadian way. Yes course. Although seem like Florida's cases That’s reasonable estimate. think generally estimates 0.5% 0.9% you’re ballpark, albeit low end ballpark.

I'm saying likely happen, certainly would happen current rates infections carry flu season doctors deal flu high rates coronavirus infections simultaneously. Absent outpatient treatments prevent hospitalizations system could enormous strain fall. Girlfriend work doctor covid patients constantly, 20% it. pretty low I'd say.  agree nursing home staff get priority, disagree residents getting vaccinated population. Aren’t nursing homes fairly isolated? course I’m assuming homes take patients COVID. seems reasonable better testing policies. staff visitors vaccinated won’t residents reasonably protected? protected exposure staff visitors, I’m sure would need vaccine priority. 

At risk sounding crass think since limited vaccines many younger people would beneficial use people may get exposed about. especially honest, limited doses first protect non-nursing home populations risk conditions like diabetes immunosuppressed otherwise long lives ahead them. 

Even people underlying conditions could get sick hospitalized develop serious side effects. people nursing homes much less likely leave surroundings, vaccine realistically buy (in many cases) years good health, think makes sense keep isolated bubbles priority. don’t think last, ahead young (30 without underlying conditions). speaking good people, considering fact populations usually isolated anyway, don’t think makes sense make nursing home patients priority. doesn’t mean important, towards front line. go 2020. hunter gatherers still hunt, still gather, lot smartphones cameras makes harder targets murder. gear coming way. nick, nicks others offered similar replies, appears algorithmically generated.

The serology NYC supposedly showed 20%. Based that's 1.4%. Keep mind 20% might lower bound, infection rate nursing homes could much higher general population. 

Interestingly [excess used considerably higher (than is) compared probables count, difference seems actually confirmed deaths. NYC retesting old deaths?  NFL test every person every single team every day season?? need muh football /s Whatever theres winning fuckers anyway. We’re seeing exponential growth deaths. Actually kind opposite far. rose fairly sharply first week rate increase subsided last week so. 

We’ll see goes 2 month approximation didn’t account slowing last week so. Figuring it’ll pick bit.  phones display corner store boast rather unique splash screen. test, increase number cases.

People going die. title intentionally misleading. quote article. 

“But there’s catch: participants must test negative SARS-CoV-2, virus driving pandemic, wear mask times aside snack outdoor breaks, according website.”

They studying people move around interact events actually trying spread disease. found cedar point longer requiring reservations closing two days week guess also experiencing low enough numbers need reservations still enough people coming they're closing two days week like Kings Island. government failed us. make choice, thrown us get us fight instead putting blame lies, piss poor response pandemic even worse support framework welfare. could absolutely help people can't make ends meet instead lining ultra wealthy's coffers. Cause course, Florida.

Edit: idiot read article prior commenting. Germany, research study, requiring masks. one time I’ve taken Uber since whole thing began, windows open he’d rigged plastic sheeting around driver’s seat lol. idea effective would been, also wearing masks.  He's pretty fun read. fun dude. quite trip! showing Batwoman?

Too soon? she’s gotta! I’m trump fan, 100% fair, first recommended masks [early April dialogue since lot whether good job reinforcing message consistently (he wasn’t) whether wearing mask (he wasn’t). 

It’s less full course correction actually showing level follow through, agree lot comments probably something public response he’s getting. Totally edgy man. Way stir pot get people thinking themselves. Sheeple amiright  Team America part 2 

It made. least face masks, gloves lab coats now.

For companies received Billions dollars aid, give money employees stay home instead risking lives $13-15 hour. could plethora reasons male female Karens wear mask right now. one piece puzzle helps understand reason why. bad US, Canada spikes cases past week.

Weird see statistics 20,000 recoveries, 75% active cases, one day. True people insist that's happened nyc Yo, anyone juicy video reaction supporters ""patriotic mask"" Tweet? wife intelligent person.

I know several people it, one go hospital (a totally healthy 36-year-old woman said suffered incredible pain every time took breath, several days). elderly relative friend died it, mother receptionist old job.

I live NYC. much March April, sound sirens omnipresent, hours day night. ambulances taking people hospital.

This something fuck around with. misread comment, based interpretation OP's. pedants lose day!!! 🙏 Thinking praying successful delivery! Sounds like everything right taking seriously. friend mine gave birth Baptist week ago and, despite high-risk pregnancy, everything went well. hope little one similar good fortune. could still roll windows wears masks uber....very low risk compared bus 10 people, windows up, masked. probably close even except bus air stagnant. Stop trying remove bias realize political science, politics simply product 7 billion different human perspectives reality. realize can't ever get handle 7 billion perspectives therefore barely know anything politics, start understand politics little. shit? Damn. I'd never guessed. Totally blows mind..../s think innocent deep state bullshit lied him. Brazil tapering bit. Yet. matters number people need hospitalized vs. number beds available. Anyone two brain cells understand number confirmed cases rise rapidly, number people who'll need hospitalized corresponding decrease number beds available treat them. mention hospital staff also risk getting virus large number patients. contributes total death number lags confirmed cases. think ""hoarding"" narcissistic afford afford it, people taking seriously wanting leave homes someone handed gun said there's 1 / 1000 chance bullet loaded, would hold head pull trigger? Exactly, let markets decide makes doesn’t. Good, can’t Karen see past end nose. generalizing make point, real issue social cost selfish bastard anymore, shame, approval envy. Everywhere got crushed early great now. coincidence. /s


It's combination people actually caring since affected them, increased immunity. Came say 😂 Gives time bail investments world speed. exactly happened. Remember GOP senators dumped stock right taking action covid? mean?? absolute last subreddit thread would ever expect Isaiah Rashad quote please start campaign say bloody attractive people masks on, adds mystery downright sexy? Yep African European swallow? Lol! Go smoke another blunt! also thinking Dinosaurs alive millions years ago. Number beast? hand, bringing lawsuit would basically end person's employment. Tennessee, maximum damages unlawful termination wages minus anything made new job. So, we're talking expensive lawsuits job middle pandemic.

They proven again, small companies get away almost anything. Heck, former employee call OSHA believed issues. OSHA sent letter, never actually sent inspector out. I'll never know real safety hazards, not.

Turnover extreme, aside that, actual consequences possibly violating law. worth anyone, even employees, call it. sparks joy Virtual education work, sorry. That's awesome but.. get kind money?

I add, read article, hoping someone could Tldr haha really weird consider people share ability empathy. I've always known real. I've always known people generally came different flavors. ever put finger different people. honestly realizing get older, empathy. ability feel concern things you. think something have.

So many people barely care themselves. hell supposed care others. Prove say. Yes feel ppl Reddit told kids obey rules wear masks better. article made perfectly clear. even included exerpt don’t know keep trying argue points I’m actually making.

I arguing schooling received worthless. tried supplement could, I’m teacher.

As parent crucial role childs education. parent need back school.

There pandemic going on, getting worse. Anyone half brain understand sending kids school bad idea get control. Knowing Jax, convention probably going happen since many conservatives here. know fact people protesting though. 3rd worst county, worst state, COVID. So, get protestors want express dissatisfaction Trump, Trump’s loyal supporters, together one place? hotbed disease?? Gunshine State??? economic crisis? unemployment benefits shut off????

God save us all. is, mean transmitted way. primarily respiratory illness, unless semen inhaled... probably pretty safe. But, *obviously* condom would make safer.

Several babies born covid-19 positive mothers virus. believe one reported case positive newborn kind placental transfer. 

Viruses weird. 330,000,000 / 2 = 165,000,000

“A majority half”

I agree made majority 165,000,001 (1 half)

330,000,000 - 165,000,001 = 164,999,999

Which number used. read comment several times see higher level pedantry missing, you’ll tell me.  like, covidbase.app hell say! Exactly. people diagnosed-because characteristics.
Seriously know one know like fucking robots damn things. creepy. Fuck off, eh think change attitudes anti-maskers. They'll say something stupid like Trump pressured Obama something. propaganda... real press. Exactly. people diagnosed-because characteristics.
Seriously know one know like fucking robots damn things. creepy.  Trump subhuman, serial killer! Yeah lifelong New Yorker don’t think ever fully get rage people current virus hotspots laughed us mocked us going hell, instead learning experience preparing. never stopped stupid talking points (“Duh, expect happen subway?” “Cuomo nursing homes!” “Oh, guess virus magically avoids people protesting social justice!”), though one-liners going win arguments virus.

Well, argued virus though liberal caller right-wing radio show, they’ve lost debate.

But agree, first hotspot Houston, maybe would taken seriously. craving normalcy all. problem bigger coronavirus. Kids much danger virus first place, kids bad homes danger would contracting disease likely even give symptoms.


Pouring resources trying make bad home life tolerable like putting band aid amputation. solution works vast majority time escape, school is.


We still put measures keep people safer school. Masks, distancing, sanitizer, staggered blocks (going school one week, online next, better nothing) static classrooms (teachers move, students stay put classes) etc. 🏆 Winning! Saving world twice! This! hate say started wearing masks, public transport, weeks ago Switzerland, far visibly changed anything, infection rate stayed same. (I still personally think masks way good harm)

The real difference government acted early, consulted actual scientists implemented stuff like social distancing rules closing kind mass gatherings, everything else kinda going like normal.

Even thought many people even wearing masks public transport (because literally costs attached wearing one) act unity done kinda well, even thought close proximity a) first cases europe b) first epicenter europe believe second strand original SARS virus.

It's called SARS-2 second strand SARS virus. Point fact six strains second sub species. 

But yes underlying point valid. third novel coronavirus outbreak (SARS, MERS, COVID-19) yes four species coronavirus continue endemic human population. 

Sorry - pedant. Honestly difference ""strain"" ""subspecies"" murky shit.  One family members full blown malignant narcissist LOVES Trump. Unsurprisingly, also downplays COVID. Lol White House routing hospital data really changed much. think reason French attacking English allied colony, made mostly former Brits, clearly deluded. saw opportunity take island went it.

I didn’t say point still stands. Keep trollery, shallow cold takes excuses. Don’t forget Spain you’re it. Nothing happens vacuum. course France’s actions weren’t altruistic support underdog felt deserved free. France plenty gain US alliance well.

So going back main point, really poking fun guy jabbering back forth wars, what’s head-to-head score again? That's biggest problem foresee election. need votes, need right places faith get them. Trumpets deeply entrenched fervor 2016, Biden landslide candidate, people less likely actually get vote.

I really, truly hope pull together get Trump out. much faith states need able that. Hospitalizations metric then. 

The big problem ICU capacity depleted sadly doctors make decision want states capacity ICUs. Covidbase.app good site Posted link below, think good share data well since validates need look excess death CDC link FT since seems altered they're selfish, they're self-deluded impervious virus. everyone wearing masks isn’t likely spread even false negative. -Throw fact viral load someone falsely testing negative would low.........maybe not. See edit below. -

Edit: false negatives early pandemic certainly issue. Apparently hospital patients suffering Covid-19 showing 20% false negatives nasal swabs. Wasn’t able find recent info sure tests improved dramatically not. live see it. mean, yeah. That's pretty obvious. people hoarded toilet paper definitely sort problem.  think one things count blessings know anyone contracted Covidbase.app mature. Ugh. I'm super big fan lungs. least 90% organs. interesting thought experiment it’s completely unrealistic. long sentiment good Trump literally exact kind inexplicable moral intelectual compromise continually enabled presidency destroy people's lives. comment see path reelection. Congratulations campaigning Trump. Yup. governor ******** worst. clearly care Missourian's health safety. cares economy making buck. think MO one last states close one first reopen....and reopen little care concern cautiousness. literally flew 3 phases matter couple weeks - even though STL &amp; KC continued remain steady rural cities state started see increase. 

My sister teaches district rural MO district told staff today ""make sure power attorney place""......WHAT. THE. ACTUAL. HECK. nephew goes district. I'm terrified them. town teaches threatened district withdraw child(ren) school virtual training. majority believes COVID fake serious care kids go back building close quarters (oh, district require masks staff students....and social distancing ""try touch other"") Oh. There’s money made fake vaccine real one. money=end story. Bezos making bajillions pandemic, buy anyone’s vaccine destroy real one. know it, cavorting population whole smarter ever (the next generation take control future) wealthier, likely employed better educated previous generations exception Gen X, equal 100% true. lived iowa moved kc couple weeks ago. town conservative. Whenever went always wore mask always least 1 person told masks dont anything... fuckin sad. Look dude I’m going honest, completely baffled you’re saying. want draw diagram *anything* showing said anything even remotely close that. admit wrong show incredible way said that. I’m even upset offended understand train thought here. 

Also would implication, assertion. assert something explicitly say something not. Say louder people back!

We hope achieve thing. I've decided focus change. One day cousin's descendants go this. Idk it'll happen generation next it'll get there. Good luck keeping masks elementary school kids. probably even higher. going eventually pass everyone doesn’t sort immunity. packing plant Oregon outbreak. 47 workers tested positive one actually got sick. get like $B us months ago? could one Mandela-effect-time-loop multi-verse-things thought died years back...?   Paywall Yeah, mean risk life every time want groceries? I'm tiered people walking right behind stores breathing back neck. can't make mask wearing mandatory stop that? tiered neck breathers. could keep us safe grocery stores, refuses anything. Yeah Twitter post amazing seeing many people say ""I know really mean is..."" They're literally projecting beliefs even he's saying exactly opposite. weirdest phenomenon Good!! /r/nottheonion everyone clapped Bride every wedding, corpse every funeral. always them. “i taking picture uploading government database.” let’s see fast get full gas mask mode going. “these people”? “*Invisible* Chinese Virus”

He adds ‘invisible’ make sound sinister. could spent billions still saved money economy money

But would require Trump admit problem, far willing do. right go trend either narcissistic sociopathic.

Or both.

The empathic people I've met right center ones completely oblivious life, healthcare, politics etc... see graph head coincides right go intelligence narcissistic. dumber empathy could posses.... definitely mother Theresa.

Intelligent empaths... Well one greatest think Noam Chomsky...I say lest get botflagged. vaccine take while. reason can’t expose people mild cold? I’m guessing there’s still risk involved. he's finally anyone room temp iq January. 40 years realizes need close everything get trump virus control Lots protests riots there. think things getting awfully heated. Wait, encouraging person shopping affect supply chain? talking going vs curbside/delivery? Says ""4000 less last tuesday... beginning drop"" guy. Yeah, spot on. someone summarize comment me? much read. we're actually spectacular front besides optimism OK well makes feel better life cease planet.

Eventually statement right. 31% usual MAGA conspiracy idiots think vaccines fake news 5G contagious. parent teacher good parent. Especially considering online resources available now. quoting GoFundMe page earlier interview, died. terribly confusing, looks like died Sunday problem US gyms going stuff. Like requiring masks everything aerobic exercises, AC vented outside instead recirculating. Also, many businesses start enforcing distancing / cleaning / reduced capacity weeks start relaxing measures almost operating procedures back pre-covid times. think safety measures many gyms US locker rooms open, limited timed workouts, bit extra cleaning. product approved release, yes, vaccines sit warehouse. still bit USA coloured think people always underestimate denial like living different planet. brains literally can’t accept things way are. *10,000 cases posted like 20 times already It’s going get worse. government failed you. Oh mean like what’s happening now? Every day, I'm hopeful next soon. I've seen. Testing grows linearly. virus grow exponentially know. Canada, think contact tracing managing cross-province movement lot good us. Another example functioning government benefit. shit Act like beast wild... Holy shit it’s real thing. saying word combination doesn’t work/is stupid concept but...no, people actually think way wtf No. death lags significantly number confirmed cases. number depends many hospital beds available, many infected high risk getting sick etc. number confirmed cases breaking records past two weeks, numbers also go up. Even though compared April, hospitals equipped handle patients also drugs work subset patients, sharp increase number deaths still likely unless somehow young healthy people ones getting infected. Wait Verizon store open? guess shouldnt call Zika virus Zika virus either? Even though ziika forest? Whatw problem calling virus way called years (from orignated?) People seem want make political issue. bet anyone wasnt trump said wuhan virus china flu nobody wouldve said shit. dumbest shit get angry over. Trump says tons misleading dumb shit judge calls virus considering that's labeled DECADES (Spanish flu, Zika virus, West Nile, Ebola) pretty pathetic reaching anything hate - dont even like trump! You’re saying “consistently” two week period. That’s nothing compared last 12 weeks.  FUCKED, could pick right one... maybe 25% Yup anymore. hope fulfilling life. Ok try ignore everything comes WH.

I think ""eventually"" got me. I'm tired, tired. could take pill sleep wotld back semblance order, I'd totally take it.  CNN impression “real” Rosie died years back. One study. Colorado. even top ten states education ""first world country"" rates 17th education. False positives galore also. surprised see headline reports 100 cases stemming mutiple fights Manifest destiny babay. Fête National. found virus doctor friend US contacts China mid-January. warning us needed prepared possible pandemic. need calm focus one million things time.  Yeah one ""makes sense needs done"" studies. take away work tho. say.. Thank Trump, blue checkmark neighbors stop wearing too. Well played! think mean get laid “mating”. Narcissists empty core want control, sex, booze, drugs whatever makes feel “alive”. Placer County. *and also linked poopie hands I've seen campaign booths sell masks $10 each. bet them. I’m sure it’s fair compare federal response dumpster fire. least dumpster fires put heat warm people.... tourism influx people city like 90 percent cities choose host. Making event place would make completely moot. fact probably like net loss millions billions. zero return Tokyo.  agreement. pointing support multiple reasons  Millennials (the next generation take control future) wealthier, likely employed better educated previous generations exception Gen X 

Tell generation experiencing back-to-back housing insecurity, largely gig economy, non-STEM degrees entirety Gen X screaming put deposit house boomers owned decades, gen x eye one years millennials know never own.

Oh. fucking global pandemic.

Tell Zuckerberg woman getting shift McDonalds. He's baiting people violence use proof ""antifa"" real terrorists. Lots comments reddit egging on. Wow! democrats kidnapped real Trump imposter spewing mind control!

/s People manipulable ... Getting real news happening gaza israel medium practically impossible, like al jazzera. main page already 5 anti-Zionist news ... even category called ""occupation"". sure cannot find news gives kind positive neutral information Israel conflict. headlines news written convenience create hatred Israel. reason, would informed happening area reading Jerusalem Post, tel aviv news. course people still mad him, he’s finally right thing should’ve done would’ve saved tens thousands people instead promoting alcohol light injection saying would magically go away.

I’m going criticize here, i’m certainly less mad already done, i’m mad i’d usually daily getting things worse. 

I don’t think responsible thouthands death suddently stopped adding pile i’d get praises, best people get relief strong arguments refuse masks president finally siding way may make much easier force understand it’s right enter shops without crowded places.

This minute took talk would’ve changed face pandemy US done early instead doing, well pretty much opposite, yes that’s good don’t see anyone would happy him.

As “chinese virus“ there’s reason he’s country leader call that, could’ve originated anywhere, name calling chinese virus serves blame china situation US, situation fairly little responsibility (slightly late communication, followed total inaction US govt anyway). serves 0 purpose government call way aside eroding political relationships china shifting blame poor handling Holy SHIT!! assumed week two because, know, 'MERICA, two MONTHS??? Living BC, Canada I'm used getting daily up-to-date numbers... shocking. 

I doubt you, provide source will? Hope get permanent paralysis Oh no, painting Christians broad brush. terrible thing Christians never done people ever.  There's still logical reason congregate person right now. people don’t like Boomers.
I’m serious. also think living/serving WWII living depression left lot people PTSD weren’t able deal parenting.

When people spout good old
days-there never good old days. difference people didn’t talk evil shit going homes communities. History work quite like used to. actually accounts things instead hearsay! interesting future Dad narcissist big time always acts like invincible. reckless daredevil careless entire life. type walk oncoming traffic saying ""They stop"" Florida Gov. DeSantis says gyms make people fit healthy catch coronavirus. People complaining wearing masks. think they'll accept side effects? 7 months incompetence regarding Covid. clean things election ... Right? 

/Sarcasm Yeah, know. Believe could leave would, country sinking ship let here. picked two jobs summer pay father’s insulin medications since he’s unemployed, highly risk diabetic. stimulus check got ran hell long time ago put towards bills live. Somehow try somehow afford university next semester even happens that, 
most people come contact believe it’s hoax flat don’t wear masks it’s infuriating, live east coast, tip ice burg here!!! everyone wore fucking mask shit would contained long time ago, Us whole self-centered country, may speak everyone still since MASK FACAL covering become politicalized statement infringed freedoms PANDEMIC highly infectious virus transmitted air droplets it’s rocket science it’s simple! believe even get virus future would shit luck thanks broken healthcare system can’t even afford health insurance begin 20 year old! 
My apologies rant, I’m done I'm happy university small rural town cases suddenly get influx 10,000 students disease ridden country months time!

How wonderful, love this.

Fucking christ depressing... Glad mentioned that. remember reading book 12 years ago vague sense dread Jimmy describes world outside compounds devolved anarchy, natural disasters riots unequal dog-eat-dog society. 
12 years later sense dread much concrete, we're good portion way there. Oh. Man. doubt it. Olympic athletes funded super well. like basically college less glamorous sports. That's sacrifice become amazing kind incredible. really doubt home facility train anything like need remain even slightly competitive. think quotes ""keep pushing!"" entrepreneurs shit..are made people luck totally ""made it"". :/ Roomers aka retarded boomers little, late. free.. people countries universal healthcare. 👍 No, want testing numbers make look like failure is. 3 million average die year US. people died unhealthy already. guess we'll get used see [Temperature Screening everywhere nowadays fair probably large six months ago, back highly contagious diseases used political footballs. cells cause B cells produce antibodies. cells kill viruses directly. HIV dangerous destroys cells, example. leads us becoming much prone infections would otherwise immune to. People wear masks they're ""uncomfortable"". think they'll take vaccine give severe headaches, nausea, chills? double? Honestly that's bad America. I'm sure companies drooling possibility charging way more.  FLATTEN CURVE ! Maybe someone tell governor that.  4 million coronas wall

I could explain bullshit statement. point conclude troll moron. Serum India also going profit. Imagine ENDING uni.

That's life right now. supposed last celebration. There's good chance actually bipolar actually borderline personality disorder. daily briefing via YouTube podcast. I’d tune frequently. trump task force meetings shouldn’t air live, nothing misinfo. I'd get me, he'd leaving ambulance self defense. They're shit. trump never sold country China accruing trillions worth debt, jail people derisive Facebook posts, personally start fake war drugs killed around 30,000 innocent people. Children included. Uh oh. Never argue idiot. Standard CON check five people roll advantage. modifiers high. think valuing human life highly purely American privilege. Think low value life poor countries. don’t understand don’t even want cold... hate sick!

We're already 4m. There's 0% chance we're still 4m week.

More like 4.6-5.4 week. hope you’re right. Doubt it, hope sitting 16k excess deaths. However, warned, Jama published 2 separate journal articles indicating preliminary research still uncertain attributing deaths Covid. number recent publication willing assign 65%. think bit modest. However, need reasonable accept many people probably required medical attention height pandemic avoided hospital fear contracting Covid. also psychological issues, drug overdoses, etc. HUGE proponent using excess deaths indicator full scale epidemic. However, would ignorant think indirect effects population throughout pandemic led deaths caused Covid virus itself. South Korea running rampant. guarantee numbers change people infected shedding viral load population. 

And someone else points out, someone brings household. wife stays home isolated, one going out, someone shoes, way get home. living alone. 

That statistic sounds specific study done.

Edit: Also, we're looking cases done contract tracing know source infections, course likely someone live vs others. US tons tons untraced cases. People idea got it, venture guuess people get asymptomatic family members roommates.  look history things burning out, much lower. remember precautions lower immunity needs. instance, wear mask, barely go contacts people, I've likely added ""herd"" without ever getting it. notion need hit 60-70% simple model fixed R value little interventions. Think like diamond princess, able take precautions end believe around 20% infected. saying that's threshold see effect. Could think worse place new cruise ship? Hope get it. daughter narcissistic mother nightmare. Luckily help. $$$$ Fox News seems starting distance Trump seem believe there's path him. air travel really bad? heard lot flight crew falling ill, would definitely environment high risk. maybe heard. Regardless, much talking plane, hopefully counts something. think reddit really isolated real world. real world, lots people think shit way worse said.   Pregnant women LOT doctors appointments. older kids daycare (which might financially necessary) lot germs get spread around. example, adult workers daycare could source covid. test results hospitals getting slammed? People still sick whether results come back not.   Okay, take care kid home day still full-time job. make sit front screen learn. Every day, months, months, months. can't see obviously difficult probably kids. matter is, it’s use test. right Israel tear down, especially it’s determined UN Palestinian Territories. 

And people wonder 1 country (USA) support Israel actions (hint: it’s anti-semitism usually Israel’s fall back criticism). It’s treat Palestinians like less human. cross immunity thing something I've seen thrown around. I'm really sure even study though see true.  behaviour Aussies copying? seem grandma would call ""a bit thick"".


Not Texans fat!


/s actually Texan Excess deaths one point available CDC website, sure what's now. Sad times sure lol. good. Maybe next time! I'd love win help fools out! Would make good story probably getting dark bit.

Are going deny sun went previous twelve hours day mostly sunny?

Or insanity boundaries? many 7. Elephants exactly it. Terrible fucking people critical thinking skills run religion magical thinking feel like chosen God.

The kicker don’t need God mind God. seen tax return yet. believe am. Also work enough hours time period get unemployment state. Fuck 'em. pay bills survive number hours work, can't get benefits covid causes lose job. glad savings. tangent, guy waiting get shot wearing mask thing first hit states. He's fucking useless, selfish, narcissistic piece-of-shit president... also person.

I cross road piss save him. chugged giant movie theater sized soda previews. LA densely packed special needs city nobodies literally put billboards themselves
  
??? also delay healthcare workers &amp; others working hospitals get vaccine first. really think fair &amp; first. Hey, question works. give name? assign number look up? Putin like, sure wanted conquer US, work land one left!? surprise don’t know sports several MLB teams either missed practices players miss delays testing results, lab. I'm sure someone love Nationwide hospitalizations surpassed first peak. detection rate improved, testing longer keeping up, people can't book tests undetected rate go again.

No state bad NY, far widespread looks worse. Anything creates obstacle supplying average home food necessary goods amps tension conflict potential. Curbside isn’t available universally, handled poorly. Delivery grocery stores spotty best suburban/slightly-rural situation, likely even less option elsewhere.

As stands - I’m using outdoor marketplaces, everyone decided that, supply would disappear day.

Grocery stores unsafe necessary evil right - you’re paying attention, aren’t likely using them. Winter much worse. white women losing minds masks? Mexico population 130 million. overtake UK deaths week two, UK half Mexico's population. Basically, Mexico well, worse. also behind US deaths per capita. really bad shit eating grin. Loving mask. Neat. Doug Jones voted remove Trump lose seat it. said patently true. mindset people support Trump use divide opposition. conspiracy folks say made numbers ""My anecdotal experience means entire country terrible worth visiting"" deaths two months, 63% deaths US reported 10 days. CDC indicates take 1 8 weeks.

Here's details CDC:

Why Numbers Different

Provisional death counts may match counts sources, media reports numbers county health departments. Counts NCHS often track 1–2 weeks behind data.

Death certificates take time completed. There many steps filling submitting death certificate. Waiting test results create additional delays.

States report different rates. Currently, 63% U.S. deaths reported within 10 days date death, significant variation states.

It takes extra time code COVID-19 deaths. While 80% deaths electronically processed coded NCHS within minutes, deaths COVID-19 must coded person, takes average 7 days.

Other reporting systems use different definitions methods counting deaths.

Things know data

Provisional counts final subject change. Counts previous weeks continually revised records received processed.  Please give man credit. Beyond headline, he's gutting country worth. attacking press freedom, implementing loopholes int law arrest attack enemies, makes living country living hell. appeals people's need change poses politician takes bullshit absolutely care fate country. Filipino following antics years. understand coming reaction reminds friends voted office regret so. motivations remain clouded me,

Oh, fill in. what's normal young girl Asperger's syndrome teenage years, utterly hideous. Instead what's normal, here's what's store Greta Thunberg going forward:

1. Knowing English speaking world using German phrase ""climate crisis"", her. 
2. Knowing legislation passed two countries, her. 
3. Knowing executive policies changed multiple countries, her. 
4. Knowing investment policies attendees WEF Davos changed, her. 
5. Knowing British Tories abandoned climate change denialism, her. 
6. Knowing motor barges loaded medical gear chugged upstream Amazon reached remote villages middle Covid crisis, her. 

Beats fuck sliding life quiet desperation like 99% aspies there. probably sign contract ... always protects Coronavirus.

Why people toy shit? like worse episode Black Mirror ever.

We also haven’t tested back like now, knows real number already infected heavily populated states fact around 4 5 weeks time States going cliff virus. Roughly 1 100 virus official numbers. also makes plain money sense. pay anyone else healthcare industrialized nation cover everyone. tf money going? Surely fiscally better way this. Let’s go! Jokes aside, US would probably squandered 2 weeks extra well. anyone even watching drivel anymore? Like seriously, anyone? might well ""don"" leather jacket hit ski jump circling sharks. 2 numbers hit 25 total (5 lines 5 numbers). Definitely win lol. Almost bad possibly could. Can't help fellow Redditors today! Maybe next time So, decided check Fox news conference see say talking points... surprisingly neutral. many favors. Now, want see absolute cesspool stupidity, go check Breitbart. included exactly 2 sentences worth statements rest filled opinions paragraphs anti-mask propaganda statements president made weeks past. fair, went Vox see end spectrum saying, overwhelmed able produce close 30 paragraphs worth writing conference ended 30 mins prior. ever see Again, watch video monuments absolutely adamant protesters would never attack George Washington monument. compares improbably child taking heroin Nah care ""right"" whatever right means weird morals.

If rest house already probably would cost effective like ""You live house 13 people? live hotel, pay room food there"" never think preventing things. reactionary country. He's seen wearing one ONCE. press get pic post, like Bible pic. Since mask photo op public event lots people, wearing mask. act one can't keep elction. Trumps gotta trump. eager ""um akshully"" someone first-grade math missed point entirely. point which, noticed it, would helped realize entire line thinking irrelevant.  Huh? fuck about?

no fatalities data think, come since believe Thanks lot! Current resident South Korea here. I'm armchair pundent best, reading three things really really well. 

1st target testing area confirmed cased. reduces need blanket testing, makes tests happen incredibly efficient. know test results MAX 24hours later. 

2nd use efficient digital contact tracing. confirmed case credit card receipts (ubiquitous use here, almost cash) absence CCTV records verify person's past movement statement. means also, usually within 24 hours confirmed case, list locations, stores, busses, subway stations sent everyone via emergency messaging system cellphones. expected locations go get tested. turn around time (here MAX 3 days results back confirmed patients contacts) short people identified become contagious. (So many examples the. One nurse got sick plane Jeju. Went work next day via bus saw 100 patients... timeliness information zero patients got sick.)

3rd. Cost. Public system covers Covid fees confirmed patients contacts. want get test can, $59. also belief system efficiency find someone around Covid. Therefore, people cautious, economy shit down. (Except kareoke bars large gatherings like sports)

Time informed important that... testing ... USA failing. job, working around public requires positive result PTO. Used savings taking 3 months protect family member. Expected country act together then... NOPE. Since can't afford 15+ unpaid days... Time get get nursing degree graduating high school  partially right. purposely built foundation Israeli side line, knowing it'd demolished.

Political theater. wish. NO, China 80k cases 1000 death per day. can't believe (wait yes can) doofus calls China virus. Another way try shift responsibility failures elsewhere  Imagine created already cure waiting right time use it! agree sentiment here, least use right “you’re” you’re gonna insult someone. Absolutes* Sorry came across jerk. upsetting. Wish there. It’s Arizona. butt fuck here. Climate change be/can stopped. USA. That's I've written off. think USA leader/global leader anything anymore, handle pandemic. think knees, shackled blindfolded excessive amount guards, cops Han Chinese prisoners Uyghurs. 

Also, able keep beards. beard probably got arrested.  one pretty good, month old though. thing could see chance good results climate would kind environment-oriented, worldwide dictatorship, forcing religiously tended new way life whatever population allowed survive. I’m confused many y’all expect random strangers give fuck you. None us entitled loved wanted. ""We're grateful privileges afforded us wealth, power, status...this darn virus sure stink!""

Props least acknowledging testing + tracing Good(tm) responsible (now) self-isolating. 

No mention masks, though. ⌛ problem friends like ""you go girl"" ... people like certain beliefs without lot reinforcement. Went chiropractor first time today, south OC. Neither chiropractor staff wore mask, even though he’s breathing neck adjusts me. None patients wore masks either except me. Whos say parents arent working? US gets 1555 cases faster pizza gets delivered. America China play sides. America single largest donor aid Israel Palestinian Authority. China moved back forth diplomatically depending world events.

Why would think geopolitics would Good Guys? *insert “well fucking shit” meme here* deaths crazy down, new cases matter, merely increase testing. Exactly mods hate hear 100% leadership. they're strict Catholics view abortion mortal sin lands one-way ticket hell. Apparently there's pretty big community Catholic Cubans Florida always vote Rep ""pro-life"" party, view Catholic Christian party. seem care little anything else. comment downvotes lmao see studied parents. /r/raisedbynarcissists bite tongue everyday, least say I'm utterly disgusted much going on.

Lol imagine save us. work condom factory They’d problem saying needs learn get ass take care herself, way 7-11 cash unemployment checks restaurant manager I've noticed one major thing pandemic; businesses adapted succeeding. ones refuse dying grasping straws like this.

The third week state's actual lockdown, sales started ticking UP. Why? I'd adapted. Fully embraced delivery options like UberEats DoorDash (which before). Utilized never used walk-up window patio area could provide even protection staff well customers, HUGE patio social distance on. Maximized online presence pushed online ordering, customers social distance; they'd come in, snag order, 10 seconds.

June HIGHEST GROSSING SALES MONTH store ever had. EVER. pandemic. wearing masks, gloves, distancing, plexiglass barriers, tons options customers choose comes getting food safely.

These businesses trying play old game old rules pissed they're succeeding. rules different now, hell GAME different, they're trying cry umpire fair.

Money made; needed ADAPT situation, didn't. Context: Nobody wears mask Vietnam right hardly anyone talks covid anymore. country less 400 cases 0 deaths far. simply true. hoard. blocked transport China Europe start outbreak asked states shutdown one asking refused weeks. Pelosi walked Chinatown saying trump racist calling Chinese virus. don’t think president could’ve done better. hasn’t outright said something doesn’t mean don’t it. It’s common sense drink water president shouldn’t tell you. Sith deals extremes!  What? see fucking huge was? size isn’t pre-existing condition?!? Yeah.

Positions reversed, I'm pretty sure shouting/weeping ""But wuz 'murriKKKan waterz!!!1!"". Like asshole.

American's alongside Chinese spend far money abroad nation 
 
So sounds like talking tourism? probably right (at least cumulatively). stage many countries tourism continents high priority. bigger issues deal with. Countries within EU rely tourism would happy get intra-EU even intra-National tourism back. Getting visitors US China fantasy point. Even EU allowed would come? much probably.  
 
If talking business (like seem later post), actually, Netherlands biggest foreign investor world: . 
 
After comes US, nowhere near cumulative Europe. China nowhere near. 
 
How possible? Well US plenty investment opportunities inside country, need spend elsewhere. live small rich country going take money elsewhere. 
 
It contest, US great country want ban rest world. currently crisis need limit travel, internally externally. 
 completely eliminating huge revenue stream option many countries. also money world, successful people globally. business leaders needed run global enterprises, saying reddit fantasy based reality all. 
 
Pretty sure tourism non essential visits. things like tourism Americans currently can't travel EU. personal insult, pandemic ongoing tough measures necessary. 
 
There lots exemptions essential travels. Diplomats, seasonal workers, transport personnel, people ill family members, healthcare workers, students, highly skilled workers, etc. I'm pretty sure great americans Satya Nadella, Sundai Pichai Elon Musk really need go Europe instead making video call, find exemption.  Uh, shit sherlock. That's super frustrating. healthcare worker got tested back logged bad Oregon. makes huge difference know positive negative. take 72 hours fever get results next day, positive, meant take time off. Now, could turned badly symptoms resolved hospital wanted back asap knowing test results! way... short term disability unless proof! saying years suffers NPD. quite severe. I'm glad one sees it. Actually educated fewer children. Better pissed pissed on. Oh no, course heartless non educated hicks. prepared country world! Again. think Israel worse schools Although seems serious fourish feet separation. modern ""world leaders"" act like fucking children. Interesting, thanks! think would improve throughput ELISA-like antigen assay detecting active infection (rather RNA- antibody-based assay)? would subject personnel constraints? research hold water slightest. rather preposterous, actually. speculates comparatively low number Covid fatalities Asia due previous exposure SARS immunological similarity Covid-19. 8000 people globally infected SARS. theory explain South Korea quelled cases, even though 3 people infected SARS South Korea there? China's 1.4 billion people protected 5000 got SARS? speculation previous SARS exposure could cross-beneficial Covid-19 interesting, would affect ~7000 survivors SARS, entire world regions. North Korea: save america world vaccine.

Also North Korea: ""prepares new prototype nuke call vaccine"" since prisoners much likely get covid jump early save us time.  Probably. even so, one side significantly fucked true? stupidity thing thing he's ever right about. still want force school openings... pay 2020. Many families fallen logic. children mean chances survival society like today. delusion leads poverty heavy burdens struggles. costs raising child adult hood cheap. They're hiding cases left, right, center Vegas. shit many places. crazy shut down. health department shut restaurants less. someone deemed essential working grocery store whole thing, can’t help first thought “quit whining”.

Well roughly 1 3 Americans also dumb fuck so. called poor. Situations like country. It’s also worth noting humans NEVER created vaccine year. Ebola vaccine quickest vaccine made remember correctly. feel like hopeful vaccine capacity next years wishful thinking... sadly. need wear masks perhaps implement even intense stay home order nationally 6-8 weeks. I’m talking National guard meal delivery type lockdown. dont see stop thing otherwise. lots female colleagues bosses England, hired female human resource workers.

Another issue children without management. pity parents children see shit happen. actually happening thought working gym makes shake complete absolute terror

and Covid sane thing I’ve heard say public while... FUCKING FINALLY dying covid. Indeed wash also. Stupid telling people low risk.. Cara Cara oranges

also largely grown california. Children cant get virus tho ""The best deals!"" Yes, everyone talks counting dying covid it. data shows otherwise. would like present side argument. Covid causes clotting issues various organ damage. bet excess deaths due younger people getting heart attacks strokes, counted covid, clotting issues caused covid may causing excess deaths due strokes heart attacks.

The excess deaths also account reduction motor vehicle accidents industrial accidents shut factories. reduce excess deaths, increase, yes excess deaths even 20,000.

There reason China eradicated virus two months hard lockdown, lot dangerous presented. survived [Black bad be?

However Florida closer 120 daily death 12'000 news cases (~1÷)


Could suggest positive rate necessarily means miss cases case Arizona Florida ? I'm hoping get bad - stuff grows exponentially along cases.

1,100 people died yesterday - that's 10% died last week 57% died 3 weeks ago. anything stop spread cases easily going reach 2,000+ day weeks. Take hanky.

They sat hands months hoping would blow world catch wind it.


I'm saying America, many countries fact, good even decent response virus. world proven selfish want all. said, CCP could done sooner, likely even conversation right now. Ended 1000 last Tuesday. still pee-school peed floor adult GDP growth due recovery efforts. Manufacture distribution supplies needed aid affected crazy flood season bump GDP. I'd gladly pay grand worry anymore. company make money, they? There's nothing stopping non-profits making vaccine. I'm happy pay grand though. although they're reading. They’re still taking seriously...still.

I went first time day weeks pick medication people jogging walking around like business usual. many people wearing masks.

It’s like haven’t experienced bunch deaths state. don’t get it. similar problems sister. told yesterday weird can't post YT videos improving immune system COVID healthy eating, taking vitamins. 2-second search lists hundreds them. FFS! u look real study Barcelona preprint big drawback. reported high viral RNA loads, high peak outbreak. doesnt add wastewater studies countries viral load clearly adds cases.
Also reason cannot fathom genomic sequencing, would say would great idea check validity findings. used 5 different pcr tests different targets consider contamination lab, likely explanation findings.

The Brazil thing also used pcr sequencing. also high cycle tresholds (low rna levels samples), u think false positives.

TheSoanish study widely criticized experts European media. 

I think needs research, taken huge grain salt.  feel like getting Canada going become much difficult soon. wonder America ever like refer post. large segment population always stupid obstinate? visible now? wonder he's seeing bad job numbers finally realizing go away summer. I'd wait November sure that. Rest assured USA eventually right thing, possibilities exhausted. Subtler putting bag head.:) suppose counting one two things happening August September: Either a) COVID dies things start going back normal, b) majority Americans get used becomes background noise. would leave time stir bullshit red-meat issues base salivate get excited go polls. Millions middle-of-the-road voters won’t care issues enough leave house. enough sit out, wins. 

That, perhaps, plan. masked sooner, would admission things are, continue be, shitty.

But seems he’s become least somewhat aware COVID going away August September, even January 2021. given it’s forced millions Americans jobs school, going stop caring. number one issue election. Yes, realizing this. dim. he’s scrambling make look like gives shit. Wow stupid chick! Orange County rising like crazy compared LA. face breathers gonna spread even here.  Even countries incompetent leaders better US actually. get shot, America. People learn loved ones die late... think says lot prejudices first assumption one 10+ kids article say hers. could well 5 adults couple kids each, saving money trying provide kids better life sharing accommodation. results? Again, yes. 

I'm really proud you. know politics, definitely using critical thinking. time seems like willful ignorance seems running rampant US really appreciate seeing young one put things together logically. us Gen Xers, thank you.

Edit: ""Spent whole time head sand?"" Kinda. sand trap. golf course. immigrants! FINALLY DOES/ SAYS SOMETHING PANDEMIC SITUATION FUCKIN STUPID Bill gates duh good news temperatures expect soon, virus survive. minor drawback is, hosts either. sure this? think impossible base assumption raw statistics like this.

Just consider indian immune response common allergies vs rest developed world. Thatd Koala Virus. there's one bright side this, wide spread mask use new normal lot people. It'll help future flus health general. country live in? fuck 16 people living one house question worth asking you’re paying private school tuition probably cheaper even long ago lol would protesting pandemic accomplishing DeVos could dreamed of.

Oh... Wait. Yank Federal dollars schools open... 

Could *guessed?!*.  Americans fine welfare long going poor people. color skin important. white go Latinos blacks ladder wish mom would stop going church. Like infographic shows, even wear masks merely ""just dangerous going grocery shopping every weekend."" far dangerous, mom, even mental health depend going church, LIVES depend going.  


Pastor, matter many precautions take, even everyone wears masks. fucking safe church right now, care become shut down. need shut down, idiot parishioners' lives stake, including dearly loved stupid mother.  also ""problem"". I'm Europe, well going ""look idiots"" lazy, damn site easier right thing safety nets place. Furloughed? here's money, sick? Here's unlimited sickness, lost job? Here's couple years generous benefits tide over.

Without doubt things would much better terms behaviour. Without think would fucked. No, no. Hands up, mouth open.:)  day late dollar short.  IM EVEN SCARED PLEASE GIVE GOVERNMENT CONTROL FEEL SAFE took ass long enough  Let's compare [what really know one lowest mortality rates anywhere. know Biden Obama stopped testing-- stopped it. probably know that. I'm sure want report stopped testing. Right middle, want, testing, much lesser problem problem have, obviously, respect to-- worst thing that's happened since probably 1917. bad-- world. 188 countries right are-- test anybody far. test, create cases. we've created cases.

I think got gist. point kiss Thanksgiving Christmas goodbye unless want see another massive surge exactly virus spreads International law can't changed words corrupt politicians sold people's rights fame money, paid price dealing devil life Damn, even got speech patterns 10/10! None frees parents return work. part goals reopening schools. trucks gone tour. Maybe everyone see they’d realize it’s real. much refit ac ducts n95 filters One Negligence Causing Death x 16 coming up! recent reduction CDC 10 days two periods fully aligned risk quarantine except severe cases. Finally good news. disagree here. gains supporters back wins election, he'll nothing lose he'll go right back caring pandemic. We'll countless needless deaths vaccine. 

If sticks guns keeps caring, he'll drive away voters, may unified federal response January. 

So practically speaking right thing. r/iamatotalpieceofshit Guys, tested positive coronavirus ive going without mask see lot evidence Facebook saying hoax. second account Seems like getting sinking ship preparing 4 years Biden attacks. considering kind risks people taking much lower. data showing virus lives surfaces, survives airborne hours spread much farther 6 feet unmasked speaker, considering many acting like staying 6 feet others wearing mask intolerable burden also single greatest threat freedoms can't really blame updating guidelines make restrictive, especially much research still preliminary. might save lives, prevent infections, battle focus getting masks faces much greater impact. relatives can't convince take reasonable precautions like attending parties (some infected starting listen experts). data rest us want stay safe. Don’t give ideas I'm church person, find strange something *need* person. 

It sounds lot like churches scared people get habit going find like never go again. I’m 80 heart terrible....profitable. Watch happened Atlanta media loves conflating statistical significance practical relevance incredibly selfish want child go back school right now. Yeh trump say fake news supporters believe it. 
Between Trump US Boris UK, populations seem lost critical thinking part step right direction. Albeit late Exactly. also depends region. Europe, areas smaller stores, often walking distance. example, go store every 2 days. ""stockpiling"" March/April, shopping week. tried make every 2 weeks, craving fresh produce. basically buying 4-5 times usual. Made feel like hoarder use shopping cart instead shopping baskets. Also plan meals writing lists felt quite odd. Luckily, situation got better I'm back shopping every 2, maybe 3 days. literally happening 

The sad part clear Orwellien headspace logic need longer apply 

Instead admiting right wing wrong trump encouraged beginning double think somehow hating ""the libs"" even though right months Gotcha. like chicken egg right? Normalized disaster, 140,000 dead. ok buying that. 40% nation cannot stupid. Maybe part brain vacation? Again... often often? would put hand sanitizer reminder side barrier facing me. Testing currently fiasco; i'd contact Leadership regarding established Corona Public Health Epidemiologic Protocol early advocating preparation received pap pablum response respond. I've progressively referring then, patients testing since April recently, past week, contact local ""clinics ED's"" again, learning mostly ignorant afraid expose corporate incompetence. ""prepared"", complexities completing evolution delivering myriad highly questionable claimed ""tests"" (PCR establishing presence virus, infection) ""crazy stupid"" and, know it. 

Eradication MUST HAPPEN difference always, when?

Remember; Obama eradicated 2 pandemics then, taught Trump.

Learn eradicate pandemic using World Class Interactive here; (notice link Official yet, best resource available, far).

Biiiiiiiiiiiiitch They're Atascadero San Francisco. may cheap studio $2200, find 2 bedroom apartments less that. mean anything time actually vote. polls coming anyway, polling? Lol even r/conservative mad saying conspiracy possibility actually giving hope. ""Maybe people plan beyond next year..?"" pretty much happened Wuhan, China Lombardy, Italy. sure got work? Life insurance denied wins he'll switch since can't get elected anyway. That's I'd rather stick guns drive away voters. can’t seem find reusable FFP3 mask. 3m, ffp3 Aura masks. great, feel kinda loose lately Oh yeah right. kept prove normal people. /s believe Trump win next election well. Majority Americans stupid supporters.

Rest. Monitor symptoms, treat like flu, take vitamin D, ready seek medical attention quickly shortness breath o2 dropping. Call doctor soon one. Self isolate let anyone contact know. 

Good luck. That’s scary summary. Appendix helps restore gut bacteria antibiotics remember. Hopefully possibilities... let anybody try bombing away! public health directors quit lives threatened trying mandate masks. 

But I’m aware politicians quit resigned. Yes, arbitrary patterns emerging know kind effect disease long short term. I’m means educated comment made think influenza, need flu vaccine year memory cells? I’m genuinely curious. Thanks! headline tautologic. cumulative case count, always hit new highs. that's uh... what? 3 months late buddy Haha...sorry Kind fascinating cant trust 100% info coming country. could literally claim anything would hard believe.. It’s insane people actively spreading conspiracy theories it’s fake plague planned government, they’re saying it’s hoax one it, they’re coughing people, they’re parties catch it, they’re opening schools, creating disinformation campaigns, spitting food, giving information agencies disease, suing stop mask orders, removing teeth mask laws, much more...

It feels like tens millions people US taken crazy pills. fucking hell going on? dip god damn depression everyone power acting like it’s happening. fuck everything making sense? Alot peoples assume everybody second house go live money side... far reallity, peoples would rather risk infecting others become homeless. literally tweeted this. 

Until sentence, thought comment joke. discovered rabbit holes Etsy last week spent 4 hours day browsing favoriting things.

Then went back another 2 hours evening favorite things.  guys mix samples thing get people tested once? meh impossible especially mainly prevalent younger population, look Germany large number total cases low deaths. Though think pointed there's lag cases, still rising, deaths, I'm sure deaths catch eventually 200,000, 20,000. really messed up, put perspective things UK, wife new cough booked Covid test next day online nearby test site (10 minute drive) last week

She 15 minutes swab, got results texted 01:00am, took less 24 hours get results. midlands rural town, close major city really impressed turnaround. 13 day result farce made Rosie historic sorts welp China give 72hrs U.S vacate embassy HK. Theft dishonest, long remove mask, wash hands potentially touching pastries, storage pastry mask likely ok. main concern would especially thick pastry would pull mask away face make less effective; wide one might also offer protection. Republicans survey (59%) believe death count inflated, 40% May.

We need teach credible source evaluation schools NOW. cannot afford leave Facebook ban misinformation. get test work. took 4 days get results back. work gave admin leave 4 days clinic ADVISED quarantine whole time. enforce anyway. weeks ago Oklahoma primary elections. Nobody would even stopped going polling place without mask. Maybe actually tested positive would cracked daily phone call. Semen vapour worst. wouldn’t lol respect you’re coming from, don’t consider equivalent. Singling license plate gross oversimplification issue (ignoring rentals, people recently moved, etc.). clear police bias matters US, expanding would risk lives more. 

The underlying irony simply restriction free movement within country, regardless mechanism, Mr. Cuomo's change attitude shoe moved foot. 

I absolutely agree implementation challenges. addition rental cars military personnel required register vehicles states domicile may retain residence elsewhere. 

I think police bias relevant least case directives come elected officials, state governors circumstances. 

I issue mechanisms support contact tracing although predisposed toward concern centralization private information public hands. victim OPM data breach understand nervousness.  Shouldn’t new isn’t patriot idea he's bothering. base fucking stupid give shit says does, would vote anyway. rest us going vote matter says know he's full shit. 

Ooooor would like hope. Mosquito season folks. lol immediately thought ""fake news""

also want funny fuck trump sorta stuff watch Randy Rainbow youtube Actual oranges Valencia, Spain ""Valencia oranges"" California, US. WTF virus even someone's political stance? noticed connection live. Roughly 1 3 Americans thinks DJT good job battling Coronavirus. Fox News Sheep smell bullshit :) 

Play Jesus want, sacrifice yourself, post results Instagram stop calling someone ""selfish"" prefers become ill all. live, 90% narcissistic?? That’s happens change way cases counted, especially include “probable cases”. doesn’t matter tested, came contact anybody tested positive, also counted Coronavirus. new expanded definition “probable cases”, course cases look like virus spreading faster. funny people wearing masks ever, virus still spreading, almost masks don’t work... What's 'chonavirus'? article almost 2 months old, summarizes another news source ( )

The Norwegian sources summarizing much cautious full qualifications dropped several layers politically motivated rewrites. discussion here:  fair though, many European nations count confirmed cases. 

That's true. besides that, many (if all) European nations open forthcoming excess mortality rates ICU capacity. US hiding data necessary evaluate severity outbreak. Testing subpar, death counts suspiciously low, valuable objective measures (such accurate excess mortality) reported. Hidalgo gotten *so much* unnecessary shit usual suspects. way they're going, surprised Republicans find unable elect anyone white house generation - provided country disintegrate long then...  pre-existing conditions, typical shitty reporting sub allows. least obese even morbidly obese, means also increase risk hypertension diabetes (or case gestational diabetes) top 3 comorbid factors dying covid-19. news, water wet. pretty clear narcissistic anti-social personality types give crap others collaborate gain them. Otherwise care less health others society. Attack ads shit Trump. people support gonna support anyway. need incite increased turnout among inherently anti-Trump demographics, demoralize pro-Trump ones, preferably turning other. Iraq declared war Afghanistan; Christian Bale diagnosed cardiomyopathy. I'm betting Donald Trump Jr's girlfriend well Covid. heard anything couple weeks.

That plummeting poll numbers made step actually say something useful today. mean, 4 months later been, better continuing ignore pandemic. turns probably 10x reported infections means 10x less deadly... hmm really makes think Aww really? broken ones Israel since Oslo Accord? pods arent gonna work infection rate USA currently. simply cant trusty neighbors thing growing exponentially.

""According information received Lao Hu, United States Government brazenly demanded China close Consulate General Houston within 72 hours, insane action.

Except actually live here. higher international law agreement two parties.

MLT previous life worst case scenario situation fucking thanking every deity sun I'm of. strong, brave soldier. That’s liberals do, BLM doesn’t show months elections sudden democrats surplus funding. Virtue signaling dangerous thing blank minds. Unpop opinion factual. get chair discussion table, lol. people tested ever before. 

Texas counting blood tests anti bodies swabs active tests “cases”

People get tested multiple times counted multiple times. 

The numbers fucked. 

Even knowing that...I bet 10million cases. Probably closer 20m guess. 

The sheer number asymptomatic cases virus produces means many people never get tested. Welcome politics Capitalism working intended, exploiting working class enriching ruling class. Well explains Trump mask rash, fatigue slight fever. Basically response people flu vaccine. That's pretty minimal every person tested. Like said people got high-dose worst reactions **that's part testing**. want know is, 1918 flu pandemic two years? way cases vaccine, just... fizzled out? They're trying distance themselves,

They're trying herd Trump. fact people need president tell masks help slow spread COVID lessen viral load would receive otherwise absolutely mind boggling. 1136 currently 4 min midnight eastern help   So, serious question: USA suffers inordinate amount narcissists, seem mostly boomer generation **and** [zoomer Pali supporters seem understand Israel controls Area C part Oslo Accords...of Yasser Arafat signatory. fair, one actually true. tiny minority huge number people still lot people. guys cancer serious chronic health conditions.

Idk answer spreading disease teachers multi-generational families. best way improve overall health preventing spread Coronavirus putting many people work possible, thus driving people poverty level wages, everyone knows leads healthier outcomes overall. Fatality rate always going drop dramatically. expected. It’s CDC estimating &lt;1% fatality despite much higher observed fatality rate observed right now. Main reasons are:

- inadequate testing, priority hospitalized/severe cases symptomatic cases
- early outbreaks long term care facilities hospitals, mortality rates significantly higher

As virus spreads general population, testing improves, rate going drop somewhere 0.5 - 1.0%...which going nightmare, given 60-80% population catch left spread unchecked. mention number patients who’ll left long term symptoms. forget tooth brush, we're coming too.

You scientifically illiterate. idea looking at. read studies try think it. 

If Genuinely want show works would love to. things stand think I've wasted much time time already. trying argue. pointing fact personally know someone 45 died. sucks. Excellent site!

Thanks Might well start counting % population we're already 1.2% Americans :/ I’m suburb near Fort Worth (just outside county). originally said would opening, Tarrant county delayed start districts county. district guaranteed community we’ll opening time. I’m hoping county steps in. crude mortality rate NYC back beginning may .248%. seems low, deaths overall population. someone tells death rate .04%, show statistic either scoff reality head explode. response call trumpvirus. Obviously mental health issues need taken care of. Hopefully get appropriate help needs. narcissistic left house 3 months. Ha ""China virus"" donating selling them? One weird, pure capitalism. Could least tried find less annoying way know talking about? Machiavellianism, psychopathy. personality traits make Dark Triad. nothing do, never did, gang.

And finally. Triad, word, predates fucking Triads. god. Unsurprising, given Dear Leader Narcissist Chief. much television. surprised, area 1-2 days medical workers, 3-4 days symptomatic, 7 everyone else. part reason can't control virus, time results come back late. knowingly wrong thing reason. certainly been. I’m late 40’s outrage button fucking worn last 3 years. doesn’t be. lot change country goes away starting neutering Fox News. I’m holding breath. Buckle up. ouch Co worker age 47 23 year old son died LA last week Ever stuck dong ignition accident? active cases. Need test thousands ppl Ironic considering people want wear masks would attractive wore masks. main point however, end boomers, DNA, DNA too. 

If global population wants walk path toward world peace, educate children let trauma DNA dictate decisions, preventing traumatic mass events like current crises go LONG way toward progress. 

The current crisis creates another wave trauma. 

However, we're still middle it. Right still good other. lot us surprised people reacting, shines light issues. support encourage healing process (enable courage), also turn healing event. 

This may biggest decision able make species.

Edit: looking thread, mostly people pointing fingers passing blame. Looking world history, same. Healing starts accepting accountability ability tolerate increasing capacity tolerate others. surprising, how? study needed come conclusion. Oh gosh country equivalent used car salesmen. 

Just we're lesser evil compaired countries make us good. highest number Covid cases world! 2million confirmed Brazil. 50k people died Brazil. Almost everyone who's brought better developing country mentioned Brazil... math population infected also 30k us recovered..

If look they're handled it, exactly are. people dying? Oh, yeah. feel them. feel them. people dying, many many more, economy destroyed lockdown measures imposed people affected badly? Yes, get country open get open soon.”

These direct quotes Trump Jair Bolsonaro. see difference?

This ""first word country"" mindset bull, money means nothing people thriving.

Currently CDC's best guess IFR 0.65%. said less susceptible. Doesnt mean cant happen, amount people 45 dying, atleast state less amount people 100 Years old died. can't even anymore...  title didn’t reward article either. Agreed. Winning?! USA #1!!...? I've reading comment since cases first started rising month now.

Something people miss numbers tests per confirmed case gone 6.5 13 USA we're getting lot mild cases CFR slowly dropping (still long fucking way go, New Zealand 368 tests per case)

California? think he'll still take seriously tomorrow? thought Trump, Pence Jared going best response. Supply chain testing gonna best ever! said months ago. Lol, believe whatever propaganda want. UN council recognized countries world tries ensure countries uphold basic human rights best can. Israel violates treatment Palestinians, often reprimand Israel. 

Why Israel annexing west bank? reason.

It's funny told someone ""Let's call H1N1 'swine flu' made people panic slaughter innocent healthy pigs."", people would go ""yeah ok makes perfect sense."" tell people ""Let's stop calling Covid-19 Chinese virus makes people attack innocent Asians."", people suddenly objection. Omg STFU. one closing anything. still buy booze - 10pm. People sudden gonna quit drinking, they'll get place earlier holy shit. Well works works False. wear mask like everyone else. I'm Narcissistic, stupid. conclusive studies data around whether countries higher mask-wearing rates (ie: Japan) lower infection death rates various illnesses (especially regular seasonal flu) vs non-mask-wearing cultures? 

Curious countries end fewer infections per capita better health outcomes get sick. talking COVID specifically, curious ""regular flu"" respiratory illnesses. Assume number cases 10x higher confirmed thus far. Delay getting shit long possible maybe eventually board real quarantine follow together, otherwise getting shit. Bought pack run wholesale store March. first run back store since March last weekend. Even everyone home 8 year old prolific pooper, still flush. mean billions people believe religion really surprising people believe ghosts supernatural things too? sound like amazing atheist im saying theres lot overlap religion supernatural Allegedly... even book appointment. took self-assessment online went Mount Sinai Toronto, maybe 30-45 mins. Got tested, results next morning.  know what's one thing common Greta Elon? took fossil fuel industry heavily slated smeared it. Almost like people feel threatened succeeding missions. kind stopped talking Trumpie in-laws. things say make sense. One example, kid's doctor said okay family visit long wear masks social distance. refused wear mask, claiming kids can't catch it. never came over. Sunday found went church wore masks. Priorities, right?  Donald Trump gets tested multiple times day. rich first say confirmed Covid. tests, anyone isn’t super rich. thought exaggerating. thought 'No, can't really say it'. Yet said, says it. look links?

Excess deaths measure infectious virus (for R value), number showing many people died 'due' virus, including collaterals. 

If fire start bar 5 people stomped death, died direct fire? really know, incident killed them, excess death is, best way estimate real damage Covid done. used method estimates flu seasons deaths decades.

Us excess death also 37% average, I'm sure refer 16k below... ? feel Team America monologue coming me. Thank sharing translating articles. unfortunately live USA surrounded people take seriously important read. please feel like apologize English. Even small mistakes could understand points well generous take time effort provide translations us. defeat batplague getting real, real offendid. hate knock high horse, death rate 0.50%.

&amp;#x200B;

Call really are: anti-sex anti-women. virus isn’t transmitted food food packaging

Obviously someone infected they're coughing food/packaging going risk catching it. That's CDC says shopping, handling food packages, preparing eating food, important always wash hands soap water least 20 seconds.

Last saw jury still transmitted eating. multiple studies may able get infected food eat research needed possibility [fecal/oral point, think safe say risk transmission though food seems low, especially careful maintaining good sanitary practices (cleaning carefully, cooking properly etc.) primary concerns sick person taking order/money, followed sick person breathing/coughing food (because can't wash it), followed sick person breathing/coughing bags wrappers food would come in.  

Ultimately numbers game. drive past fast food places around they've got lines constantly miss business. I'm everything avoid catching thing means direct contact (however brief) people likely infected something avoided right now, fast food workers likely unable stay home sick, less able afford medical care, less likely PPE (N95), likely deal strangers day day (often strangers wearing masks especially drive thru), likely depend public transpiration, etc. risky job pandemic. Bad hair leaders worry, he's gonna say something moronic balance soon. 😭 Pneumonia causes damage last months invariably heals. COVID, pneumonia may lung findings never detected patient come care. COVID incredible scrutiny everything sounds like COVID specific. not. article doesn’t good job phrasing I’ve seen articles said state moving last call back 10 P.M. Columbia/HCA $40 billion / year company time (which would roughly $71b today's $ value)... How's math working there. confusing net income revenue imagine. 

Synergy Pharmacy hand, responsible roughly $200m fraud incident listed, annual revenue $5b. Want math really worse?  Lol gold though Wait...what trying prove everyone tests negative wears masks?

Edit: bad. rest article loaded Friend Cochabamba say going well. says president know do. Either head Cochabamba department mayor city apparantly recorded saying covid something hoax. recall either one terrible. hard imagine said number people trouble even getting help hospital. People actual need treatment. number people Cochabamba died Chlorine Dioxide despite warnings government. legislature (abstaining political rant) may even approve Chlorine Dioxide matter [openly sold numbers look getting better. Hugs, Bolivia. Trump idea even going on, everytime speaks obvious give single fuck anything really, reacting ego. (a certain segment least) mythical view country elevates status global force good, anything working must work forces evil. literal dumpster hot garbage. literally cannot. 

The hospital friend works one bigger ones Mobile two patients currently ICU, theyve already opened ward Pediatrics floor (the floor works on) diversion protocols place. 

I hope mask ordinances city state help curb spread. plans try conceive next months. We’ve planning go ahead, I’ve wondering it’s smartest thing baby’s health. definitely gives something think about. Kids deliberately lick hands wipe kids tell to. means next 1 million take week? 

I understand still continuing reopen everything cases get worse worse. “Trees don’t make sound nobody’s hear fall.”

GUH Staying home equivalent entire school year little/no social contact and/or intellectual stimulation cause anxiety trauma lot kids well.

The reality really good solutions. God help us Regardless teachers (my wife one upset grim reality), students, staff... kids going get sick, spread virus, go home. Going home kill thousands. that's talking K-12, Colleges exact result kids go home - using public transport, airplanes, etc - spread parents.

None makes sense likely end happening lot people end dying shut ""omg know would bad!"" mothers prioritized family work... Good them. Screw employers understand appreciate necessity. harder manage family business hide office close door. Luckily kids old enough zone video games youtube. total fail getting adhd/asd kiddo online schooling trying work. enough education...

Of course design though. they're morons? hear anti national healthcare people talk want piss them

Me too. can't handle idiocy anymore. stupid average person is, realize half stupider that.

So, yes, 100%. According George's theory, 1/2 Americans stupid, minimum. curve implies brains, many without. Water wet Senate House Representatives every 2 years. Torpedoes. Thank you. Signed, us eh border security (the canadian version) unfortunately cancelled years ago.

how miss border hijinks guns, weird foods, such. trump made calculated guess 

Trump never made calculated anything. He's narcissistic asshole lie misdirect avoid anything could put negative light. Still wife's hair stylist come house. Yay, I’m narcissist Disneyland/California Adventure cancelled reopening. Disney World open Florida Gosh, given history, one would think we'd nicer species....🙄 grasp reality know everything political Right. didn’t even come Spain. 

We don’t say ‘Spanish Flu’ attack Spanish. Trump sure hell uses ‘China flu’ divert attention away catastrophic responses virus push onto Asians. 😂 thing separating us Altered Carbon living Gods life extension. billionaire cult joining? Death rate per cases? total deaths? death rate lower April still havinga rapidly rising death total.

Lower death rate whatever reason good, like negates rising death numbers.  Yup. Im glad it’s finally sinking people screwed are. many people, kids go back school. saying schools aren’t child care...yes...I’m sorry are. solid half reason invented alternative working sweatshops, mines, farms.

But...I’m glad bars opened June Maybe use quarantine time read cheap TVs poorly made sold price getting good deal all. Black Friday year insanity. (Not specifically, Mindraker) Yep cares getting people sick possibly killing making money. sure you’re getting downvoted, reading quote alone seem conflict title. agree, reading articles good Houstonian here, fair took pretty seriously specifically NYC poorly. shit ton international travel due diversity. Local government really tried keep Houston safe possible, Abbott got involved we'll are. he's dipshit *Charge em tests, extra expedite*

*Excess death relabeled delayed onset pneumonia*

*Fudge numbers here, round there*

*21 percent rounded 2 percent now*

*When comes fixing healthcare, there's lot tricks know*

*But time comes it'll someone else problem end* Relic pulling group drunk Americans behind tug...friggin' glorious crime sure. People prosecuted unprotected sex knowing HIV positive. same. surprise here, another side affect covid. something could rid now... someone spits like this, legally beat shit State Connecticut?  Wait... Onion article? They’re hosting concert discover virus spreads? research concerts planned? Yea realized recently. mom complaining people say shit like man haven’t heard anything all. Realized it’s probably look like bit douche bag bro. People cowards also flatten kurds that’s already done South Schools could way left open air classrooms combined distance learning. like masks probably gonna take 6 month countless infection death come conclusion gonna obvious.

And yeah weather bad open air point. gotta get creative. hot second, really thought indifference highly infectious virus could cut right deep partisan divide force everyone stare realities.

Sigh, wrong. Even politicized. give climate change. Sadly going alot articles like unless fed something soon help people, imagine felt choice go work.

Food ain't free. fatality rate 10 times lower

Sure account underreported deaths thousands pneumonia excess deaths states including order make response look much worse. Really, that's basic economics. Right now, people can't shop like want safe, everyone still wants everything wanted pandemic moment safe (if sooner fact) they'll rush spend money exact things. 

*The demand changed* every business industry making money started go right back making we've got control. Every employee necessary started necessary well jobs lost returning. There's doubt this. question if. say things concerned about. 

Small businesses getting support may able reopen. really even problem companies successful still successful afterwards company meeting popular demand one location can't return someone else come fill void money made. concern large corporations take advantage swoop replace small businesses. solve giving aid small businesses safe reopen help get started again.  

Another concern many older people decades knowledge experience working levels companies dead sick return work. Businesses spend lot time replacing take time remaining workers get level gone.  

The economy 100% recover. fact better better prepared next pandemic, recovery certain largest concern long going take. people dead left disabled virus, longer takes people feel safe running old habits, people negatively impacted government's failure provide disaster relief, longer recovery take.  

If work get spread virus controlled quickly, government provides relief people impacted going debt put food table end homeless, help small businesses recover safe open, throw little stimulus money low/middle class couple times months things safely reopened things bad. This. right here. Hold up, extended it? everyone starting talk ""second wave"", really even exit first? never huge decrease cases Maybe children suffering we’re trying force back schools unsafe many areas. Maybe they’re suffering see hear nothing blunder blunder majority local leaders. Honestly, I’d worried kids OK right now. fucking normal. guidance. you’re stressed I’m worried you. Yet still recommending, mandating masks. also add myesthenia gravis list. Let’s real. dumb asses would take seriously start. said 10 times cdc? link? Yeah, totally, meant even coronavirus cases US, we'd see California deaths per capita rise fair amount, whereas NY would stay stable. difference death rates per capital would narrow degree.

What arguing (due various reasons) increase mentioned enough get California close NY's per capita death rate, agree with. Months ago trump fans (or bots) reddit claiming trump always took seriously democrats calling hoax didn’t believe it. 

I know trolls kids, also know fan base read comments believe them. Whatever feeds ego Guess again. dont drink all.

Jut dint like fact order ""prevent"" deaths inevitable (sooner vs later), push many millions people poverty, anxiety, poor education. lead poor health outcomes.

The cure worse disease, unfortunately. can't stop Covid (not soon, anyways) we're slowing great cost society. That’s looks like everybody else  want fancy info graphic used president justify schools reopen blasted put high risk?

Of activities listed, schools biggest unknown terms spreading, given lack information regarding younger children whether spread not. Demand exceeds supply. Cha-ching! told quarantine. even think pro trump media saying things father believes.

Does father watch Fox News? they've pretty consistently anti mask. Tucker said social distancing/masks basis science. Laura Ingraham used bogus study say wearing masks actually harmful many hosts suggested Covid bad media sources paint be. one point, Eric Trump said Covid would disappear election(suggesting hoax) *Please fuck off, eh CDC chart feeds people want say deaths overstated. shows excess deaths 6 weeks. know that's result delay recording deaths look September we'll likely see them, that's anyone already convinced think. I’m sure teachers also want schools reopen. give want, can’t help resist helped. poorly written article. thought going talk data whatnot comparing three didn't. feel informed before. found Detroit pistons fan CALL BINGO! (BRAINWASHING) grandma's age boy hesitate think prison sentence might end would back. Weeeeeeeedddddd. fuck else gonna do?? Wait Government rescue us give us jerbs back?? Hahahahaha. sad bunch levels. days since 4th July?! saw coming

Not many 4th July creating deaths did, they're behind $2 paywalls lol  selected entire sentences, edited things context. really don’t know you’re realizes it’s hard gaslighting hospitals capacity, refrigerator trucks filling up, covid testing can’t keep spread. took press conference mask wearing grim sign things get bad many states he’s needing shift gears necessity. hoping could politicize election it’s hard followers vote dead. absolutely cannot read name medicine without thinking Cloudy Chance Meatballs. Let's forget 3rd candidate president. Jo Jorgensen running bipartisan member. bipartisan since 13th president recall correctly...look that's gotten us. never seen Eyes Wide Shut? Illinois high school trying reopen completely, stop thoroughly refreshing excellent act policing opposed usual mode, wrong things wrong reasons. It’s similar assigned seating activities medium/high category.

Numbers people approach high category, clustering cohorts mitigates. really, I'm using today's number can't find direct source Synergy making 2015-2018. time prosecution roughly $3b / yr entity. going amend previous post felt would wrong use number can't find actual earning statement company on. 

I'm still sure argument trying make point. I've showed happens often goes unnoticed CEOs. yet show evidence Rick Scott stole money. Lmao love see it. sure kiddin? higher, even go one day on. like people causing trauma won’t admit thus traumatize next generation. 

I think best try let positions power try mitigate damage. say friends narcissistic parents boomers nothing like raised kids different maybe personality disorders talked everywhere help people heal better job. sound like brick wall I’m sure. deadly. think it’s crime knowingly spread AIDS and, proper treatment, isn’t AIDS less deadly COVID? Check video maybe eye strategy worked, deaths per capita would've looked like Germany. Instead worse US. no, strategy clearly work. made clear care fact guess really said. agree still know wasn’t referring mask mandates... tied together. problem large swathe Americans highest office nation lowest dirt farmer mistakenly think know better entirety worlds health experts must done combat virus. could maintained quarantine till met criteria set forth health experts worn masks reduced transmission less 1% upon reopening. Instead this. America led disaster. None inevitable. something prior decades ""trickle down"" economics privatization brought us point. disagree gym grocery store much different. Gyms generally members only, one I've going way less people given time grocery store. Plus people, I'd say less chance spread. Also keeping mask whole time New campaign manager. People dum ..well shit. woulda thunk?

Also.. I’m sure understands difference survey scientific study.

Edited add: Wisconsinite too.. beginning. Winter coming. Trump recommends masks can't social distance. realise virus linger air like fart. Americans pissy wearing masks? Welcome poor America.  Bing Crosby's ""Brother Spare Dime"" recorded depression back scarily still relevant RN 15 year old article SARS relevant how? I’m guessing sometime replacing campaign manager. Didn’t Kushner fail times too? &lt; 0.31  Hey take test 5 days surgery make sure negative. told test stay home quarantine til results came in. telling people giving test? people listening? I’m wondering quarantining getting test, awaiting results would help people. guess there’s way enforce that........ Remind Me! 1 Month. Fantastic analysis Deggo. can’t definitely claim point it’s certainly range possibility.  millions unemployed Americans, hundreds thousands sick people, 143k+ deaths? 

He's quite clearly actual sociopath extreme narcissistic qualities care that. Nice strawman thing outside Archer ?! New campaign manager would good place start. knows, he’ll probably flip flop nine times send many mixed signals mouth ears like sound mouth. regular pattern him. gives speech that’s unusually measured non-horrifying, gets sorts praise pundits saying he’s turned new leaf whatever acting ~presidential~, within day two gets Twitter says something totally contradicts non-horrible things said. wasn’t even totally kidding lol, would remotely surprised tomorrow retweets mask-related conspiracy theory. be. Narc logic 101 - ""I care. liberties important. care constitution?! Probably not."" problem focusing specific number actually would regardless hospitals areas seeing surges like Houston parts Florida (the cities escape moment) running beds. result people turned away taken conditions okay normally. set number hospital beds trained people go along them. serious issues like wide spread. Point people may may dying suffering immensely.

Try ask alternative questions would feel like stuck one situations? feel okay put hall crammed room patients, might make it? Would feel okay knowing people care run ragged edge?

For conversations questioning specifics data surrounding covid I've yet see rational concise answer can't get people hospitals reporting capacity. I've even seen video intensive care units people beds almost touching one another cords hoses practically tangled trying reach outlets machines meant one person utilized multiple people. Nothing okay best have.

All becomes mute people wear dam mask stay home feasible. Adding caveat making issue person whose job done remotely works someone seems think managing people means breathing necks. capable getting morning, putting pair pants getting work time, chances pretty good able dam job home. Confirmation bias real. saw that. Still sounds extremely crowded. can’t imagine living that. understand that’s point post I’m seriously trying understand anyone could reasonably live like that. exactly hoard? Junk? died already. That's fine, sure actually follow public safety guidelines goes away considerably faster. That's we're asking folks.  Mega Karen  California full morons..but also double population. percapita...NY still winning. Doesn’t Cali also 1/4 number deaths. exactly same. Still applauding NY odd thing. Makes complete sense yet racist people don’t know difference chinese person asian gets wearing mask that's great news. right. said bacteria brains bacteria good you. ""Numbers looking great, much better"" twittered intelligent presidential scientiest contrary synch agenda. Yup. Greta one gets attention though seeing little girl speak dramatically future resonates people emotionally boring adult discussing nuances around what’s causing climate change feasibly stopped

Greta getting attention general public they're hearing everything need to. plenty people talking nuance minutia science none focused primarily her. discussion would lost public anyway. 

I'll admit environmentalists opposed nuclear power not. issue lack scientific information lack trust ability maintain high standards hold companies accountable them. people think incapable species building safe nuclear power plants, believe that's unfounded concern. unfortunate consequence number aging plants run companies continue used newer plants constructed. Damn. real regressive people He'll talking shit masks within week. happened today adult sat Donald got best behavior. Rest assured special needs Donny throw shit storm rail maks soon enough. basically...wait two weeks? none predicted happens...wait two weeks more? 

OK... It’s sad, nobody hates Americans Americans. entire society cluster fuck. need piss? Got tdap booster couple months ago arm sore nearly entire week! hey, better getting freaking tetanus. know flu shot every single year, right? live streamed services, risking anyones' lives. Sky daddy ain't gonna save Covid. mean far noticable effect July 4th. increase week pretty line last weeks. crime Welcome poverty I’ve lived people. never many. keep popping babies can’t afford? 11 kids rent sky high need least 5 bedroom that’s even enough. genuinely want learn read studies? looking fight internet... time play whack mole, bullshit edition you.

I linked 1500+ studies sight use key word ""mask"". many think support mask use?

Scientific method what? like 6th grade level teaching days right? Surly least think smart enough know works right? 

You get cherry pick one paper like still maintain credibility. New record, bitches! America's best everything!!! literally try anything. That's posted wearing mask. cares suddenly believes save lives, desperate attempt poll better since nothing else working. might surprise learn Greta regrets boat PR stunt since caused extra carbon footprints (the flight 2 crew members) flown economy class commercial flight.

Having heart right place equal mind right place. Remember teenager. administration [officially people wear facemasks public back April 3rd.

But watching CNN forgiven believe made recommendation. particularly stubborn, pretty common trend politicians pivot decisions towards polls leading elections make decisions whatever's popular. They'll also make incredibly unpopular decisions election finishing final term.  COVID-19 shown many idiots US stupidly mocking NYC. would think would learned prepared. think demonstrated schools closed less severe threats 'World War II'.

No, didn't. showed two examples single schools closed due localized outbreaks contained Spanish Flu, disease listed reached pandemic levels US

H1N1,H2N2 (58), H1N1 (68) pandemic flus US Spanish doubt able send child school want to. schools actually shut fall semester seems unlikely be. 

Not remotely true. name going oh, polio outbreaks absolutely led schools close parents pull children school attendance.

Very isolated quarantines schools closed days weeks, months years doing. He's closing like 2 hours early, closing stores/restaurants. Everyone still buy need, get 10 so? know plenty people flown recently, tested, seemingly issues (they wore masks, etc). TLDR: common cold doesn’t carry criminal consequences. intentional reckless behavior spreads disease serious public health consequences—such HIV, SARS, Ebola, COVID-19—can result criminal majority states communicable disease laws make crime expose another person contagious disease purpose. Even without specific communicable disease statute, states general criminal laws—such assault, battery, reckless endangerment—that used prosecute people spreading diseases intentionally recklessly. emergency public health orders place, prosecutors charge people violations quarantine emergency new coronavirus (COVID-19) spreads across country, prosecutors using criminal laws punish people purposely expose threaten expose others states, prosecutors charged violations specific statutes prohibiting intentional exposure transmission communicable diseases. states using general criminal laws prosecute people intentionally spread threatened spread virus. example, prosecutors charge “coronavirus coughers” (people intentionally cough spit others claiming virus) assault battery making terrorist Miami overtakes China. WTF Uhmmmmm...

If 16 people household 11 kids, think go work. joys poverty. Maybe afraid speak would make leave house? tell work get fired?

 Maybe needed go work pay rent? get food? 

Not everyone willful Karen, imagine living house 13 people probably best position life.

It's completely irresponsible regardless situation, country exactly known taking care people. Sorry, please fuck off, eh happened BACK MARCH. f'ing time! half year late, I'll take it. 145 thousand dead thinks good time. think reason LA actually shut again. Garcetti keeps saying ""it might happen soon"" happened yet. California burned surplus reserves already. Unless federal government actually steps assist, Los Angeles shut unless things get insane. first thought too. hope results replicated asap. trying nitpick here, IFR Covid-19 believed around .7% 1.1%. That’s 10 fold deadlier influenza. Weird Pfizer one showed stronger immunity, sub hard Oxford. hard daughter without common sense. I'm sure childish negotiation made reelection campaign:

""Sir, going lose start promoting mask use.""

""No, fake news, fake polls""

"" Sir, people using questions""

""ok fine, whatever, still get call China virus""

""... "" Hey insult people extra chromosomes like Yep. dumb. friend recently work ayurvedic supplement company told boss meeting UCLA USC hospital board directors told boss covid death BS bcs want 'covid death money'.
She believe number likely higher reported. 
I told BS unbelievable bcs dont big guy spit shit like risking theur credibility 'Dr' ayurvedic???? freaking dumb. Girl drinks turmeric suddenly become MD. Huh, shit eh. anyone dumb enough know this? 2M. usually end covered crusty really quick. sinuses become efficient snot factories add ""visiting friends/relatives"" indoors/outdoors here, something similar. That's even worse. 11 children many. Haven’t restaurant since started according co workers seats super far apart live PA Breathe, drink water, stretch, get political reddit couple hours. We're American, means we're hardy stubborn hell. got this.

DM need chat. Fuck living 16 people. give week tops something sets short fused simpleton starts railing masks. throw nonsense like flags, statues, canned beans go it. Yeah, would want even one minute conversation nation's top infectious disease expert pandemic briefings. shit show. I've seen organized high school governments. 7% among children, realize 56.6 millions kids go school US. equates 90000 deaths.

900 deaths assuming 100% contract it. Make mistake it, America’s bad. assholes everywhere know biggest malignant narcissistic emboldening narcissists wear masks, engage toxic, egotistical behavior is? Donald Trump. They’ve complained liberal books liberal schools past three years. terrible indoctrinate children. sudden it’s “we open schools. Education number one priority!” Huh, well least step right direction? Oh shit, imagine infomercials we’ll endure years this. “If loved one suffering complications COVID-19, may entitled compensation...” old tired conspiracy theory “they make money death”

The way theory would make sense got money confirmed patient.

Do really believe govt (inept may be) paying dead bodies?

Thinking government paying money hospitals patients ventilators would logical thing believe - heck would encourage hospitals put people ventilators needlessly.

But no, choose believe that, reason, govt wants give hospitals money dead body that’s getting shipped door. :( know zero business suing public health concern government shown zero leadership interest paying people stay closed really choice. 99% everyone boomers karens makes head hurt. Oh, one people extra chromosome thinks death rate .3% still thinks 990,000 preventable deaths okay. ROFL. explains everything. first thought was: much cloth left? Thank much. days ok, days really suck. crapshoot. So... repeat Obama's term. Yeah see it. He's saying would've better 100,000 people die March April 10,000 deaths afterwards current trajectory. That's 110,000 deaths better 140,000 deaths counting. Easy there, DeSantis. Houston problem? Ironic. hits close home.

So many family see think never happen here. Combine friends family traveling living like normal. viewpoint worrying sudden close family member dropped radar. family think I've started abusing drugs reality person spread Memaw... Thinking specific case (which sounds despicable) general problem, seems like something difficult legislate set punishments for. would like one decide kind behavior which, course, exists 'milder' forms well. pandering sides going since 2016 election lol. far beginning. Six month since first us case. That’s hope. Social distancing, surface touching awareness, masks might make flu season less bad. I’d curious see COVID “over”, people continue wear masks either they’re sick flu season.  think OPs point lot news articles calling “long term” “life long” effects, point empirically can’t know disease jumped humans (for arguments sake) 9 mos ago Whew. Lucky break. Compliance varies across LA. even high compliance areas, there's certainly tonal shift people behaving. People comfortable eating inside restaurant, still comfortable eating outdoor patio (that also may really follow proper social distancing), people going gyms. Basically, outright prohibited lot people itching it. Came post Empathy thing take it? Kinda like ""real men, real Americans"" get Covad-19. Maybe distracted Vaccines react proteins outside virus. Mutations may change proteins, susceptibility vaccine may change it. see link mutations difficulty treat arrogant shit? Also, I'm molecular biologist, fuck you? Trump administration [officially people wear facemasks public back April 3rd (over 3 months ago). thoughts exactly!!! explains it. devil's. Well technically workers aren’t grocery shopping They’re probably gonna end republicans anyways Idaho looking good... used think well understand theory pure siloed confirmation bias totally incorrect - human spectrum far complicated that. Cluster b’s wear hat whatever political persuasion gains power admiration immediate audience. You’ll certainly find lot covert narcissists (the worst kind imo) left, probably overts right - really, they’re everywhere. get that. surgery already done quarantined. 

I’m saying : test givers across US state telling testees quarantine waiting results? are, testees following orders? Even results delayed (which unacceptable IMO) people quarantine taking test getting results, shouldn’t cut spread? Unless people don’t care don’t quarantine test results come in. course Wonder idiots stop wearing he’s now? Charles Darwin wins ;) Whoever follows incorrect moronic interpretation bible doesn’t wear mask, win Darwin Award! mixing lot stuff together, hard watch. talking 100% death rate per ur previous topic putting death diagnosis somehow. different thing 100% positive rate ur link.

100% positive rate resulted inflated death rate either. 

Just like putting death diagnosis increase diagnosis numbers since low death rate is. 

At point, say u either intentionally unintentionally mixing data together confuse mislead urself people. Nah, I'll let experience stand people want examine it. 

What wish could take back contributing DNA mom. Otherwise thinks it’s tagging susceptible psyops target kind upcoming New World Order nightmare scenario. Still narcissistic, diff approach angle I’m talking places like cvs, Walgreens rite aid. don’t know anything clinic testing. It’s available, people personally know aren’t going way get tested unless directed board health close contact someone tested positive feel like getting time work sucks like wasn’t officially informed invited. read news like rest us knew. I’d offended too. re-election wins. election. “Anyone wants test gets test.” - DJT, March 6 ""your argument"" POTUS he, ""they.""

For someone writing teachers, seem pretty ignorant yourself. Aside atrocious grammar spelling, seem believe ONE (stupid) MAN responsible 50-year-old problem. COVID-19 expedited collapse education due longstanding systemic issue. 

Now, let adults talk. Gotta love pro-life anti social safety nets people. Makes sense. That's lol. I'd consider one big supporters.

Voted 2016, every intention vote 2020. However Trumps response covid19 awful. 

Truthfully idea I'm going vote. Meh, cares. gets half Karen's start wearing mask good thing.

I think first time I've heard anything sensible come mouth. praised might backtrack. forget entitlement eventually imprisoned Typhoid Mary. Maybe that's right answer cases. Bangkok babies wore face shields like March April. yeah, guess parents aren’t here, idk. going work though. Many pools positive many. groups five, average every single group positive. Maybe groups three might work. that's really enough downsizing testing volume. Article today South Korea stating virus likely contacted home. what. mean Democrats fighting too. Let's blame one party. today 139 Democrats House voted cutting defense budget 10%, that's votes bill. Obviously that's still better Republicans get partisan mindset one party blame problems. Right, it’s least bit comforting know overwhelming public opinion still small influence behavior fair....you guys Cleveland Clinic University Health system. distrust politicians government.

But let guess, completely trust Trump this? we’re stupid, that. Mine took 9 nyc. month ago. Pharma’s gonna pharma. Bingo Yeah modern diseases know about, need vaccine herd immunuty. Maybe specific strains influenza get herd immunity, mutation rate means daughter strains still circulate. 

Perhaps viruses recently become immune never noticed. science hard. Like would need sequence lots B cell receptors see ones bind react proteins every known pathogen. hard prove negative. sympathize parent, daughter part reason are. expect much sympathy poor choices. saw someone today bitching facebook gf going quit job NURSING HOME going require covid test every week “against rights”  Texas akin climate wise Northern Africa Spain. I'm Michigan live ridiculous hot is. thing value oc beaches freeways la sd mouse God sounds like real dick. 🤷🏻‍♂️ hope test negative break 48 quarantine avoid invalidating test. seriously refreshing hear. wish mindset spread moment, actually patriotic country. Seems like we've lost types values. get kind mask etsy. Lots grandmas making good masks. sell etsy. That’s literally Typhoid Mary Somebody /r/politics said could've come get-go MAGA-branded red masks base would've eaten up. Narcissist’s main concern avoidance shame. low self esteem. Someone selfish may want something moment. Ok troll.  came say. Fox News started encourage viewers wear face coverings, take precautions, etc. “if finally admitted it’s bad months downplaying it....then situation much worse realize” I’ve waiting 6 days test result NYC. Lost sense smell probably covid. today feel completely recovered. Wonder I’ll ever get test back!  Disney evil , people need stop worshiping devilish place. Who's gonna tell he's million cases late? Never said healthcare bad. combination good affordable Healthcare point.

I got tested yesterday - free.

I received 3 month worth blood pressure Medicine (2 different kinds) also gf (also 2 different types) 1 medicine hopefully allergic reaction. Spend around 15-20min doc. Doc free medicine costed round 20 bucks.

Few years back surgery (they needed extract 1 muscle), remember long Hospital 1-2 weeks. received 3 months physical therapy (training, massages on) twice week handle lost muscle. Cost = 0,00 bucks watch it? Oscorp's discount brother. Okay hear here. 
I said too, first started US getting big Louisiana. 
My logic was/is, hospitals still functioning full capacity still plenty ventilators.
I knew covid controlled US. knew rate going hospitals going overwhelmed month. 
I'd much rather hospitals help people still care, half US corona there's enough supplies/doctors treat them. know part problem, thats logic. Even think ""it's flu"", getting sick flu fucking sucks. I'm young low risk I'm still everything avoid catching it. That's exactly r/coronavirus was. SARS, MERS, NL63, forget.. CChD314 something like another similar it. Common colds mostly rhinovirus 15% one last two human coronaviruses. Covid-19 part common cold pool thirty years big deal then. Still kill people then. Fair enough! Thank much. Definitely kick rear it’s safe anything without mask, even it’s going casual walk. 328,000,000 New study: calling people names found persuasive. Must've bad contributing. anyone even ever change mask become harmful? 
 
What winter likely tens millions die coronavirus harmless summer? need immunity. disappointing. saying this...and getting shut many people. urging protestors stand protect themselves. need ride take streets virus gone. title mean less. tons information there, many healthcare professionals unhappy constitutes “Covid death”. admitted inaccuracy involving false positives negatives tests... world would logical person skeptical inaccuracies. don’t think it’s political though... kind another thing Trump terrible lol Oh no! Herd immunity would end lockdowns! Again, try find another job? Yes no. graduate degree science marketable skills like engineering tech, really difficult.

As striking, 90% workforce lose here? competing illegals migrant workers. I'm still waiting breakdown, I've asked twice. Wow He's masks months. Putting people danger, allowing people risk lives ignorant, bullshit, false claims virus. he's changing tune wants get reelected. even words. say man evil, mean EVIL. Everything gross ass administration calculated sinister. Ugh government fucking sucks. Smh. narcissist try prove statement wrong Ridiculous. We're number one! We're number one!💀 don’t live South somewhere that’s hotspot, you’re looking something safe friends, went mini golfing earlier today lot fun! find outdoor course wear masks whole time, it’s pretty damn safe. still see people live life, smart it! Uh, found one. I'm better anyone else. try, reporting third-handedly? suspect latter. people still posting snake oil salesman says??? First COVID deniers said “well death rate still low”.

Now moving onto “well it’s bad area area there”.

Jesus. many need die stop trying downplay this? thought meant reported all. Good point great article. seen before. Thanks! Internet Explorer person.  takes longer die.  thinking getting sick. numbers starting come in. prepared. Testing tracing rolled got first cases. Four months ago, 8,000 confirmed cases. Today, South Korea 13,800 cases 4 million. This. someone virtual funeral last week suspected Covid blood clot death, alone messed up. can’t imagine actual death loved one way. 

To think spent money obvious. people support Trump doesn’t mean wear masks stupid.  everyone follows blindly like Fascist Leftists Politically Correct fascism identity politics propaganda BS. us think one never wearing mask period. want gov/wannabe fascists telling wear masks that’s decision keep one cares Thanks trying enlighten can't bothered shit. say government made sense. said works.

And disagree want. Nobody cares wrong.  larger question though, public need guidance first place? Maybe i'm ignorant society, seemed like basic science time wear mask, regardless anyone said. Respiratory virus, confirmed community spread. Huh, majority people coming direct contact, maybe aerosol/airborne transmission. Huh, protect threat? Hmmm. sound like jerk, damn. still first wave, go way curve. dipped, came back up. annoying preteen much money? think person person infections happen cases sustained contact large amounts droplets released, sneeze. burps really release gas, large fluid released, velocity get mom high enough viral load infect passing by. outside also benefit. also assuming person passing even coronavirus first palace stage still highly transmissible, statistically unlikely hardest hit places. 

So really nothing worried about. understand anxiety I’m anxious level paranoia people sub little unsettling. good lesson aware surroundings times though step away put mask see someone coming close towards you. turn head away. important note Florida’s reporting shady hell. think lots better things throw Well article one. Tests stratified urgency, usually health care workers first, admitted patients, outpatient tests. doubt much non-admitted pt got pcr done less 24 hours. Antibody test sure, easily, PCR. friends used sit sun park Norcal, watching kids play 3x week. One time discussed five us table vitamin deficient, us extreme. 

Your assumption wrong, assure you.  briefings contradicts it’s strange didn't.  historical context see Spanish Flu. graph clearly show never got first wave.  second wave would likely mutated virus us getting case count lower contact tracing testing ""discover"" back. big time this. People latching short-term data points extrapolating long-term conclusions. Fact much unknown. Could first hit virus low vitamin levels coming winter higher rates mortality result. summer went on, people's vitamin levels rose, faired better. 

Not saying that's case, merely could reasons things aware yet. 

Correlation causation; right everyone working correlation. understanding downvotes this. MEE ties Muslim Brotherhood Hamas. They're exactly crazy Israel Jewish people. What's even ironic lack free press Palestinian Territories. safer unprotected sex HIV positive person undetectable viral load share living space someone covid. Charities often inefficient, whether donate bearing whether advocate systematic change NYC 10 times many people, counting bordering cities driving every day. comparison moot spend far far much time money finding interesting shit Etsy. Lol I'm watching Lee Min-Jae film called *Zombie Sale* right now.  FYI several Joon-ho films Hulu. kind worldwide yh comes social media. much fake information around especially social media sites like Facebook, Instagram Twitter people fall it. remember seeing poll quite large number people said get news social media. simple example ""plandemic"" documentary went around social media sites. shit like goes viral bound get people believing People shouldn’t rely charity survive. government taking care vulnerable people using tax dollars help rather give tax breaks billionaires.  Notice switch? probably told lose landslide continues himself. Yup! like incapable picking elephant picture refuse drink water one hand now. even listen yourself? said anything political party? brought pro-life bullshit, doesn’t signify specific party, though course easily say Republicans overwhelmingly ***pro-birth***. Pro-life religion driven, least churches offer help children they’re born. Unlike Republicans.  reminds late night shows ask random people questions street know pick dumbest responses include, embarrassing.

In one, big map asked people name county US. country all. Full grown adults couldn’t think one. Half pointed South America called Africa. looked ""selfish"", still sound me. really important - curious.   caring oneself;  primarily one's interests, benefits, welfare, etc., regardless others.  manifesting concern care oneself: *selfish motives.* Love reading stories like  I'm advising anything. I'm simply emphasizing president stated recommended required. girlfriend fever super tired. getting tested Thursday live studio. Pretty high chances get no? Weird way spend much time saying ""I would like children die meet arbitrary checkpoints"" many countries managed flatten curve point could reopen large parts daily lives rather safely. first wave passed, US managed turn never ending tsunami. Fauci begin recommending masks? True narcissists definitely give crap families way normal person would. type coherent yours.  Blame businesses terminating employees then, blame government helping people extending CARES unemployment benefits, etc. business can't survive close down, oh fuck well, shed smallest tear poor company can't survive employees opportunity near death experience. dumbass friends going I’m responsible getting black drunk comfort home. never, ever went math lecture college grad school nothing me. fault people teaching can't adjust pace everyone room, mind wandered day. Nightmare someone attention issues. 


Videos much better, rewind drift away, play 2x speed concept know well.  Based this? Man, must young! Many us wrote decade ago more. :-/ took new campaign manager get wear mask, scientists medical professionals. Think that, lmao. Misleading title.

This chapter every anti-mask Christian read. Everything's bigger Texas Okay, I'll try bring comprehension level. 100% death rate stupid surprising came you, only.
If hospital makes x every COVID patient, add COVID patients list, whenever possible. means every person dies gets classified COVID, means every death gets classified COVID, hospital makes money claim patients.

Are . . . still lost? think mother, father, grandmother dying would leave better off? Ah yes, nothing shows good leader like throwing chief health advisor bus pandemic... turn him, knows. disgusting part CDC longer gets information hospitals, go directly White House doctored make looks like everything’s right. Blasphemy. see you’ve made multiple replies thread casting judgment person. Maybe take break reflect lucky born situation choice life laid front you? blessed, hope appreciate that. say hate, mote like, disappointed. Well get worse then. semen inhaled

 bet I’m trying hard believe Chinese statements, it’s faint-hearted. real believer, know? yeah, go get food outta nowhere! terrible advice Wouldn’t coronavirus considered “major illness?” _laughs Las Vegas_ 

He said before... get probably 100 videos it:

hes random one 3 months wife literally spit face yesterday like 8 symptoms COVID waiting test apparently deserved walking away yelling thing spitting face. According her. I'm perfect person wronged before, feel like way line I'm scared know do. I’m hoping I’m dead really gets bad. curriculum thrown together emergency response thing intentionally prepared remote learning, disingenuous compare two. started to, one side began politicize followers happily ate shit up. completely borderline. 666 comments this...

Also, dude could transparent plastic wrap.

But whatever. gets people covering up. Nah, like 175k died due complications covid. suggesting people die causes labeled covid deaths show death numbers dropped 175k.  /r/Moronavirus imagine able feed family, losing home cant pay mortgage making 16 people homeless, children. 

All 0.02% fatality rate. said before... get probably 100 videos it:

 Yeah, r/coronavirus  Wow. winter splendid. /s God Twitter better one. hit nail head. lot judgmental individuals call person stupid selfish she’s living 16 people, choices probably work starve. type inequality virus exposing. 100% really hope kids stay ok I'm surprised many said wrong private even try push stay online. Mate, works, works, matter Chinese. always buy hear tv, many political agenda/interest. 16 counts reckless endangerment, manslaughter deaths. lives inherently political, everything economy work political affected it. ahistorical must one understand that? far gone individualist rabbit hole gone come conclusion politics place discussions pandemic planning. It’s like live lives separate anything everything refuse accept don’t live within vacuum, historical society process conscious decisions. think stumbled countries ideology. really want know anyone actually explain moderators shitting diarrhea idea, enforcing it, eating slop up. anyone explain I’m ears I'm grateful Europe keeping safe is. deserve better. That’s do. nothing trophy him. trophy talked looks, body wasn’t father would date 🤢.
No wonder much plastic surgery- installed worthwhile looks. doesn’t pay attention boys. co worker told buddy tested positive. Got results 13 days tested. time still go work like nothing going on. time got results already keep working. shit fucked man. assume anywhere go people it, stay fuck away anyone. much net worth gone charity last 5 years ... zombies? steel man, doubt used political reasons. great job America really showed world handle global pandemic think lot people think public health issues affect attend them-not covid, line thinking common. 


But creating super spreader events affects entire communities. think part reason one person dies, multiple news articles writing in-depth person's life, background, exploits, loved ones, death tragic loss community.

When millions die, there's way write every single one them. essentially become ""faceless"". Old ain’t dead. Many us still work, lives would like get back without threat death disability. Younger people aren’t vulnerable, older people certainly shouldn’t last list get vaccine. Healthcare workers course 1st, however. Repeat Covid testers ""just keep swimming!""  one thinks Obama president who, appointing trusting right people, stopped Ebola infectious diseases dead tracks despite case. keeping people safe fundamental function centralized government. mf’er gets credit saving us election finally fucking listened.... ironically biologically successful people ever ""They believe effectiveness behaviors see barriers adopt them,” Zemojtel-Piotrowska said. 

Huh? narcissistic? person makes sense. That's avoid second wave let first one carry Feels like ignored 14 research papers probably got Covid lol Ego empathy. Sad. Damn....I even heard anyone mention LA, MS AL. Offices really variable right now. Fir example go work, closest person sitting 200 feet away (in different room). that's 95% workforce working home given time. I’m sure nazis saying shit, needed job hanged. Trump ""conservative,"" though, sense. could argue Republican party exactly ""conservative"" anymore.

Edit: clarify, mean super disingenuous people voted vote play support conservative politics he's farthest thing it. thought too. he’s wearing encouraging masks now, bad things really? United States vast varied country; dunces tempt fate go Canadian waters? sir makes shifty-go-betweener. That's horrible. county would let doctor's office act way? 

I felt confident going offering appointment scheduled COVID test order allowed. 48hr turn around drive thru testing. 11 children. Hard popping babies” Dude. never heard pro-life bullshit? Also, way show ignorance chaotic life actually is.

Oh yeah, always pro-lifers pop 11 kids Democrat-voting Catholics hasidim /s. 

Religion religion, regardless political party. Religion usually inhibitor common sense birth control. forbidding employees wearing want?? every number new high too!  You’re lucky, work letting people work home want cramp many people building mean humanity, right? Thx Even countries ls close other, demographic really different. look immigration. stockholm, worst affected areas problem areas suburban many immigrants. immigrants poorer living conditions, example many generations living appartment. van kids, parents grandparents living 3 4 rooms.

In swedish families, nordic familys dont live several generations. think reason. Sweden much, much immigrants nordic countries. Like die heart attacks strokes caused Covid blood clots. wonder... people, many republicans? That’s simple diagram? Airports hella roomy sure hella disenfected. Everyone still wearing masks. shitty airports maybe need queue long, modern ones queue get one gate boarding. Possibly security check never mins good airports. Thank you, too. think take one day time now, even though it’s hard. Meanwhile, think deaths under-reported. Wait  Yeah re-election. win people over, dodge blame. opposition would said anti masker stuff, well trump say Nope even actually one. Cause pretty sure even realises he's going win anyone, hand end losing core fanbase move. amount money I've put towards stopping AIDS band-aids.  I’m calling - mods republicans get extremely testy even single hint criticism leader. easy say perspective ones riding around shouting “white power” golf carts? elderly Republican voters? Yeah. fucks give realized looked cool black ones.  Well, donated plenty tax dollars several mega corporations I'm sure really needed layoff many people. Oh, there's wonderful golf holidays helped pay/ donated know among things... That's nobody talks much friends opposing views. I'd rather stay friends kill asshole going least shittiest shit. Lol yeah shoot me. AKA ex well. Nit solely based virus fool. Everything thing he's done last years changed alot ppl minds. year major leadership flaws exposed! can't lead fn horse water. answers questions everything gripped nation year. also cuddles sworn enemies around globe. Theyre advancing strategic plots world domination sit backs brushs Intel concerning them. totally using smoke screen fact. MF git head ass far can't see does, cares less understand what's going on. Ppl sick shit show!. know am....🤨    Everything bigger Texas fucking time. Wonder mask defying MAGA assholes going say now. consider countries centre world? Seriously non American sometimes wonder Americans idea rest world actually exists. cool there's clearly ton, sorry guys. Yeah, I'm (was) way Iowa. dense population mixed people knew stayed in, took while. in-laws neighbor (Male. 90's) got somehow survived, that's case effected personally. got hired current job, sent another state training. everybody training hired Texas wore tons American flag clothing. Pants, shirts, hats, insane. guess that's got idea patriots.  Likely million deaths... know hate him, know he's right reasons, *please* make sure people life refuse wear mask see this. might really big them, might save life. remember.... AstraZeneca may able help.  Y’all make sound like American made vaccines made Trump know getting downvoted; butthurt NYers, perhaps? 

Both sets numbers way (underreported), though speculate much. agree situations specifically, choice really household depending income survive? Harder criticize harshly imo. living age narcissism. truly wonder protests early June TOP states open made horrible combination states OPEN woulda brought.
It seems many state cases started going higher around time. Tell coworkers friend’s late father died coughing blood alone 2 weeks without son really appreciates them. (Sorry coworkers like that.) would thought would happen? It’s like happened everywhere else months ago locked /s ""Get use disappointment"" That’s first good thing he’s done Yea ain’t one tryna smash Makes wonder deaths Wales, Scotland, N. Ireland understated. thought had. couldn’t understand death tolls lower comparison England (based population, numbers). Probably 5 adults 2-3 kids   Thanks. better. Sadly, Aunt Grandma also caught it. I'm hoping make it. tested April Los Angeles County. instructions waiting test results email received *with negative results* almost two weeks later. hope process quicker detailed now, man, clear back then. isolated symptomatic, WFH anyway, always wore mask/distanced afterward, case, I'm sure MANY not, especially go workplace. Agreed! struggling people don’t give fuck people dying! Yeah that’s cases Japan slowly rising again... I’m sure rates keep climbing. Everyone know northern CA careful, wears mask, socially distances even outdoors. keep peaking?? people doing, where? Damn. I'm sorry. Stay safe. heard keeping windows open and/or getting HEPA air purifier could help keep healthy roommates sick. Long term chronic lung damage could life-ruining. Take someone like me, asthma added lung issues would mix well god also fiction imagination. 
But way u would believe would u. agree, rare moment sane words even motivated actual caring people's health. actually helps things get back normal would huge relief. also helps win though would pretty depressing need education contraceptive options, absolutely, would think kids number 7-10 would maybe start see shit works... font think give much credit, go suppose manufactured problem simply could later solve order gain popularity? people start wearing masks supports it, becomes popular move him, better way emphasize create problem first place? worry time enclosed &amp; crowded airport (generally full 2 hours flight, allow security, bag check, etc) plane don’t think true. applies person willingly spread virus. sex, comply unprotected sex complying possibility getting infection. Well, knew would happen. California resist spreading around country back March/April, certainly pass killing residents. tide turned he's desperate. already better educated American politics average American voter simply questioning thinking critically.

Thanks registering voting idiot! SF's numbers really low. People around really good using masks staying away one another. really thar hard figure out. Testing atrocious limited start pandemic limited number cases really identified. Also depends catches it. example care home outbreak expect horrific death toll mainly young healthy getting infected death toll bad. mean CDC say actual case count could like 10x higher what's actually confirmed   nieces private (Baptist) school recently reopened, granted small town really large outbreak yet due spaced nature houses around here, think tallest building town 3 4 stories, think case count going drastically rise even public schools open private schools already No, said thought people wearing masks show disapproval presidency. mean masks work. first day Trump serious

Did something happen today? average citizen supporter Trump. 

There 2 types support him: corrupt stupid. stupid louder corrupt money average citizen. Hence situation find now. Thanksgiving, everyone know someone lost someone... ""Busy schedule flinging feces"" 12/10 roast adding vocabulary. Thank good sir Yeah, circumference. Time boycott stupid asses. Identifying makes easier. Sorry hear that. hope buddy okay. Straight don’t let end casket u cough even around  displayed understanding 1-99.96% less 1%. I'm genuinely surprised.

That’s fatality rate don’t spread fake news. numbers flatten run tests. guys! found way flatten curve!!! Oh spare me. Trump administration long history classifying documents info damages reputation narrative. information leaked public right know. warn friends family time. People dire situations aren’t going tell people sick. They’re going go work desperately need money. might actually convince lot stupid people finally wear masks. can't hear high horse. 45% voted (S)Hillary Clinton. time big RNC convention! 

Everything’s totally fine. ""Well heard someone dies car accident COVID-19 count COVID-19 death"". world time grab dead body, swap them, test see COVID-19? takes week test results come back people US. OP conspiracy theorist troll. I’m old enough remember first time trump “took seriously.”

It lasted 3 days.

As soon sees stock market falling, bad poll numbers difficult question reporter, he’ll right back “woe me, virus hurting election, it’s actually bad, mainstream media exaggerating it.” Extinction level event Read first sentence last comment. never free. Brave? Folks wont even put masks keep mother grave. **dark triad** refers personality traits narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy. called ""**dark**"" malevolent qualities.

From Wikipedia   talking someone lived severe poverty, think parents made horrible choice children could afford fucking livable house.

Downvote oblivion, don’t get people pop kids 1-10 can’t pull shit together.  Anti-vaxxers laughing us (as yet) vaccine tell need get. (sigh)

Anti-maskers - social distance them. Feel free take notes. I'm good. city summer 70-75% means less road accidents, saying toll even higher excess deaths figure? fuck 11 children.

Like 1 like clockwork -- trying start new dynasty? without financial backing it? seriously irresponsible. Knew since kid. Especially person part majority. hear sounds coughing gasping due Trump's failure leadership resulting increasing COVID cases. quite bit stocked well. live earthquake country warning go couple weeks without much help least long lines help. Right store runs buying extra food items there; feel like month fall winter want go store all.

I keep need even emergency, goal help others time comes. example bought roll thick plastic sheeting windows inevitably break, bought larger roll need help neighbors might think maybe can't afford buy things case live small apartments without storage. reason large stock first aid supplies extra tarps. lived major quake, sucks can't see coming like hurricane, localized strip like tornado. widespread damage people can't safely enter homes. night one lived poured rain.

So guess ""hoard"" acquired slowly, times panic buying, eye helping friends neighbors. dumb question. Even favorite anime"" became minor meme making fun Reddit, I'll say bothers hit Trump's account yet declared war coronavirus sub times I’ve cast good enough charm keep going definitely thing I’m meaning likely see Mars civilization, highly doubt completely paid off.

Fucking good would've prevented competent leaders. I'd argue little higher... Maybe 38-39% look state state data google ""coronavirus stats"" shapes curve states hit earlier vs. later states two peaks, one much higher 

It can't really comprehended national scale rate infection state different increases different times  find something new. /S  dine mask free barbecue joint. Freedom! Fear pandemic eat up. It’s highly recommended take care mental health times, especially you’re home day. Exercising cooking new meals helped tremendously, strongly suggest it. Indeed. eBayers sometimes dropship Amazon. Shit shows fast meet minimum purchase get free shipping, typically. They're making money arbitrage. Awful fuck divisive one? news: water wet. want say assholish way, tens millions Americans live situations probably expect maybe can't even imagine. 

Americans indoctrinated ""USA #1""...""richest country world""...""pull bootstraps""...""personal responsibility"" happy horseshit realities wealth inequality (among many, MANY issues) quite stark go mostly unnoticed privileged.

There millions American citizens little access quality education decent work opportunities. make starvation, indentured servitude level wages. can't move, switch jobs. live 8-20+ people house make ends meet. live cockroach-infested, mold-ridden squalor (assuming they're living car). even refrigerators. I'm talking backwoods grid Appalachian redneck town, I'm talking major metro areas.  society doesn’t enough help vulnerable, sure. schools one places actually getting right. Plus schools provide kinds enrichment even things going well.

Despite that, agree shouldn’t open now. Pandemics create shitty options, badly managed pandemics even worse. yeah, kids going miss one social services have. lives house 16 people 11 kids

i highly doubt 10 room mansion lady felt like *had* go work oh, going double ignorance relevant studies citing COVID-19 transmission.

Do think viruses same? think wearing condom might prevent COVID-19 transmission happens work HIV, all, virus virus? I’m rural California NY suffering San Francisco Bay Area everything could boat. rural parts state refused take seriously. want recall governor facilities rural areas closed cases. Fast forward areas open Tahoe tons cases tourists leaving cities avoid shut SAY?! Lol. Happens best us. order never enforceable without judge signed order. need study know that. Def! Lol

I can’t talk people’s money mine. thing do. Hopefully others join, not. good. people Florida voted Gore. election calls election reform. Current governor 30k, 80k ballots thrown out. It’s hard know actually won, take wild guess. Oh, psychology. Always ready spend time money researching something already blatantly obvious. America. work enforcing strict mask policy, everyone gets email check in, it’s front door, attached doors waterpark EVERYONE mask on. guy yelled boss today saying policy doesn’t exist. 

People retarded. cannot think anything worse retarded. would interested know adults would fair marshmallow test. money would would eat first marshmallow throw tantrum others got second waiting. uses different figures calculations. Namely, himself. Roughly 1 3 Americans fucking idiots. Sweet mother god people please take seriously 😭 Grocery shopping: low/medium risk. graph sponsored local grocery. Flatlined 3.6 roentgen Im glad dont kids!😓  We've known efficacy face masks long started advocating them. defensible. Read ""historian"" split second ponder whether pandemic months turned years without realising. Republican. TV star cares ratings. Sadly, rest Republican Party problem getting Trump’s bandwagon push agendas. That, opinion, makes majority Republicans valueless vain is. Yeah bring argument? outlier. Outliers always exist matter much might suck. eBay orders came Amazon boxes. don’t understand wtf Yes. supports dead, win? wholesome, someone send spiderman guy it, probably already do. need panic, get tested quarantine get results. like never made past diapers. Fuck stupid rule sub, fuck you, moderator specifically trained working sport psychology. Keep things closed, sports bad choice. Facing mental health challenges though, dying (or grandma dying) worse. think people quarantined getting tested getting results good. feel like ask everyone soon test given. feel like people resisting masks stuff. hope virus ends soon. feel horrible people died. point, think admin believes infection works favor somehow.

Not sure seem heavily pro-virus Yea, people feel forced struggling times painted bad way seemingly justification.  smell flyer troll. likely win 

Don't take granted. Vote November.

Also: Remember elections one every four years. Electing state local representatives may impact daily life often stepping stone higher office. don’t think actually said kids related kids, it? Texas Peep Show -- Debbie Dallas....From Afar YOLO!!  ""Where God went wrong"" LabCorp.  everything you.

Take me, love you! exactly trying say? LA hottest spot CA. 

Not everything Democrats vs Republicans Civil rights movement: Boomers aged 0-20 years. really driving force here? Seems like Silent generation. I’d interested proof driven boomers, that’s hard sell since born years cited. 

Vietnam war: well yeah course protested—they ones getting sent fight! don’t recall protesting war Middle East, recall driving SUVs bumper stickers said “kick ass take gas” 

Yes, technology progress adulthoods involved them. That’s true every generation. It’s like discovered penicillin put man moon. Don’t get wrong, iPhone cool, but...

What boomers years actual power (1975-present) was: war drugs, protest “welfare queens”, drive costs housing, healthcare, education pocketing difference, totally trashed environment despite scientific evidence really doing, divorces broken homes generation, tank America’s international position reputation, skyrocket incarceration numbers could look “tough crime”, outsource American jobs developing countries inhumane business practices, sensationalized news media...

but yeah, like said iPhone cool. anxiety (exempt UK) wear mask. son exempt autism, still wears mask. toddler also exempt, wears mask. children understand importance masks lot better I’m seeing adults. list dominated college towns. low incomes current college students would really skew data study like blogspot.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Could perhaps give scientists time write results up? phase III started May publishable manner right now. sum money connected huge get even pharma industry. fuck read results little earlier. 

The phase I/II results came last week rather clear indication one dose works cases, two doses turn knob 100%. them, would try two doses well strategy. uncommon well. TBE requires two doses create sufficient immune response needs freshened every years.

Also, contradicting bit here. move trials hot zones, yes. However, US biggest hot zone all. reason there. fact, rather perfect infrastructure would resemble almost every first world country. Theres multiple adults household, roommate situation. Maybe kids definitely arent read COVID-19 positive says roommate infected 16 people Atascadero home, including 11 children.  two-month-old baby boy, he's barely two months yesterday, got COVID-19, know, right there, that's alarming me,"" Satterfield said. absolutely worth making stand over. give in, family come see big deal soon enough. Judging said probably live one states declared disaster area. think still big deal people community start dying? Melania meant “Be Best.” sounds like snafu real lockdown. seems someone know hwat doing, posted order even signed copy???

Am missing something? Yea noticed. say trials. could siblings.  Wut? biggest boldest ever see, reckon. That's kinda thinking almost like they're trying make country socialist guarantee everyone 40 getting really tired american opportunity bullshit. Starting doubt mans word... lol That's bit condescending isnt really.  one parent both. I'm sorry. can't imagine pain. Well Chinese experts David allan covid 19 right ?  response airheads start spouting MUH FREEEEEEDUUMS, simply ask last time went grocery without pants drive without seatbelt watch go blank. “Well that’s different, pants cover butt”. 

Yea, wearing pants public protects seeing ding-a-ling...put damn mask. yeah ppl pass high school bio think know MDs PhDs years specialized experience read conspiracy theory Facebook  See study - case.  need start getting paid study obvious. Trump actually found something inject you..... bleach. /s  people alive die. hopefully soon bolso. know said said 

*Sigh* No, think disagree 

With what? Making estimates closer reality?

An example, let's assume 600 deaths people aged 80+, 500 nursery home residents 100 lived own.

Further let's assume IFR age group 10% (in reality significantly different male female, purpose example matter).

If estimate number infections among people aged 80+ *in general population* deaths 600 / 0.1 = 6000, however estimate deaths people lived 100 / 0.1 = 1000.

6000 vs 1000 seems lot difference.

In opinion places like nursery homes, prisons, ships sea viewed special cases (a lot people constantly living close proximity) naturally higher infection spread can't used inferring number infections IFR.

P.S.

In similar vein can't extrapolate different regions country (except something like Monaco Luxembourg) region country whole - different conditions. biggie;) 100% ex like this. also ADD OCD would essentially reiterate lie head head many times became true him. knew lying said thing time memory otherwise trash. remember happened morning, could clearly recite lies he'd convinced true months years ago identically every time. second wave much worse. company developed high throughput testing goal making money, lab resources sitting idle could better utilized help pandemic sooner it’s sooner business resumes normal. biotech, one’s making money patients hospital covid patients.

Edit: company company work I’m sorry understand.

Yeah, understand, I’ve trying. whole thing shot coping strategies shit. social interaction completely dead except SO. Moreso since quit FB. Maybe 3 friends text within week, that’s it. 

I used spend 15hrs week gym. can’t even make half hour yoga video time. structure gone, body image issues much worse body literally whithering away.

And job one sometimes work home, sometimes go office, sometimes I’m living hotel different state week. never know basically morning it’s gonna be. Sometimes there’s nothing others days 14hrs long.

But recognize lucky gainfully employed young healthy, feel like shit feeling like shit ""I’ll deny deny reality push headlines don’t even support narrative. 

lol lot stupid choices. Like
Lying usefulness masks. lying statistics helps one.""

Apparently lied said two easy things prevent spread wear mask physically distance. Lmao California 3rd world. aware US multiple vaccines, countries well? Notably Oxford's? fact, UK made purchase Pfizer vaccine China allowing test there. makes great headline that's it.

Not state obvious California twice many people state new york.

Here better picture problem CA comparison states.

California 24th number cases per 19th People shit indeed deserve extremely forceful punch. sucks hosts didn’t know though. looks like previous complaints least. Don’t get wrong- shut fuckers knowingly let people party there. couple months old, here's one answer question China portraying America right now...

 little ironic, coming people 4 months government funded summer vacation. patient zero something? Ahh, interesting - guessed testing respiratory viruses less, mention it, seem make perfect sense. Thanks reply. Exactly! get way free-market enterprise. best [estimating mortality number infected best [paying attention There's one original link! Exactly.

Get line 🐑 Jesus Christ. max 214 AZ 8 years ago Nah, that’s bs. ~~CARES~~ cover sick leave since awaiting diagnosis.

edit: correction , would believe yes. you’re positive pronounced dead even car wreck would covid related. course. doing. intelligent thoughtful society works.  whole states crammed selfish assholes! I'm pretty sure president genuinely stupid. works. best think mean additional 40% vaccinated whole population instead already immunity. add 70. That's spike new. Go look deaths, mirror spike perfectly, delay 4-5 weeks. capitalizing words middle sentence? Reminds grade-schoolers learn grammar. reason can't google them? Ah, see you’ve read articles, too. know common situation is, given I've never special medical needs, I'd imagine uncommon. typically run 95.8 96.5°F. Even highschool, hospitalized Mono, peaked 99.3°F fever, that's still highest fever ever had. 

In scenario would make something like silent carrier. Even followed guidelines. Interesting say originally release last lifetime recession. also know testing soon disease process substantially increase false negatives, too. 4 days infection typical time symptom onset (day 5), probability false-negative result infected person decreases 100% (95% CI, 100% 100%) day 1 67% (CI, 27% 94%) day 4. day symptom onset, median false-negative rate 38% (CI, 18% 65%). decreased 20% (CI, 12% 30%) day 8 (3 days symptom onset) began increase again, 21% (CI, 13% 31%) day 9 66% (CI, 54% 77%) day extra crappy states like Florida don’t track negative results. Getting hard hide dead GA?    patient Daniel Griffin mentioned couple times TWiV. one really starting watch reports. ME, NH, VT lowest cases anywhere country. closed states ever much lower levels states seen since march Hell no. unaware illness causes issues immediate direct death? Maybe research plethora evidence showing long term, potentially debilitating, lingering issues result contracting virus, even mild cases. get you’re saying. Another redditor point though thousands gets pushed general public (currently 500,000 people needed last round). 

Unfortunately, don’t really another option. It’s either get vaccinated don’t. wonder people said polio, measles, smallpox vaccines released consumption? 

COVID-19 requiring us put health people’s hands. It’s scary empathize that. terrifies too. running risk calculator, think better getting vaccine not. 

Just $.02. Meanwhile state governors banning cities making mandatory. Hard hide many dead singling US, fact, survey reported people Western Europe lowest confidence vaccines world, one five (22%) disagreeing vaccines safe, followed 17% Eastern Europeans saying same.

Muh glorious Europe crushing curve? guess Southern West Coast states punished 😬 ""If scared"" bullshit, lets idiots control narrative.

Stay home *if prudent*. hell prudence become bad thing? testing lag Arizona awful NYT, categorises 14 day rolling average calling state cases dropping. reality, almost caught resulting tests taken 5th Yes assuming parents choose 100% virtual, stay home parent home schooling. get tested? I'm also Bay Area (Peninsula). I've done two tests. One gave results 30 mins less 48 hours. drive thru. know phony ass video coming. probably working already, fake tears all. resolve challenges beliefs trying marginalize critic dismiss always remain ignorant. clearly understand, virus becoming endemic anything mutations virus, everything human biological response virus. **Every last one 75 products made Mexico** many products made company(s). Lolol fuck say masks don’t work. 

Please quote me. 

Are retarded?

You can’t even stay topic. Thank receptive new information. Yeah, pretty much gear go store live risk ppl. NY, there's reason keep everything right vaccine even though area bouncing less 1% infection rate 1.9% high recently. lock properly therefore lockdowns work No. not. Could provide sources results lockdown? alluded to, follow lockdown closely. You’re treating cases though comparable 3 months ago. Yes, double cases, much due increased testing. hospitalizations early peak think it’s safe assume actual infections early peak. death rate cut half, expect wave 2 deaths peak around 1200/day 7-day average 300 known active cases Denmark - need wearing mask point. still issue false positives symptoms pass due RT-PCR test picking dead viral particles. testing patients isolation work well. coworker liberal exact argument comparing Nazi Germany. understand people anymore. Yeah go ahead forget reasonable chance trick treating year, I’m sure try another kind stupid absolutely.  analogies apt. science.  Thats viable strategy. dont aim vaccinating everyone, youre bound continue deeper economic recession. People feel confident safety around others ""we fine"". Ignorant take everything told granted, without asking single question. tell lot mutation rate 6 months. Except forget also ""missing"" deaths, deaths would occurred things like car accidents occuring people staying home more. boys'll home Christmas! 


*\*3 years later foxhole...\** way get masks internal like injection, maybe powerful light?  Pretest probablility king. Correlate clinically. already 2015. 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆

Only 5.

But Bolsonaro well. one would accept “I went bar didn’t get COVID” prove bars safe, they. Bad science doesn’t become good science agree conclusion Pfizer got $1.95 billion production 100 million doses vaccine already exists appears effective initial trials. amounts less $20 per dose, since Pfizer U.K. counterpart AstraZeneca pledged produce coronavirus vaccines not-for-profit basis. Despite never even produced working vaccine past, Novavax got paid $1.6 billion produce something doesn’t even effective. So...who friends whom? I’ll masking orifices, don’t worry! wish true. Wait another five years moronary here. many people boiling fake news surface, soon connect wont different US too. Can't kill lung already dead withered!
Safeguard lungs COVID nice protective tar shield. There’s lot fear, understand part it. People reaching something make sense all. 

But makes sad infuriated time. would compare influenza? probably lot 10X due people infected longer detectable antibodies. Also large percentage population likely susceptible begin with. Check Sweden now, new cases deaths dropped off.  epidemiologist Anders Tegnell public health agency said rapid slowdown spread virus indicated strongly Sweden reached relatively widespread immunity. think it’s gonna different next time? *May odds ever favor! /s* 

In seriousness though, please careful. think yet, really hard ""look back"" mourn. Spain able largely (for now) me, sounds like really bad season allergies. (I'm allergic to... well, plants animals) China hoping steal enough information come vaccine first try save face starting shit fest spreading around world. Good luck Pfizer. information freezer trucks, sister nurse Dubuque hospital that's cancelling surgeries require overnight stay starting next week hospital beds full up.... government.

And said way back start entire comment thread commenting on. saved trouble finding it. sort coup underway... 

""Yeah, yeah, still got it. know, crazy... one week"" Covid turned political nightmare

It's something happened though. turned political nightmare one person, Donald John Trump purpose. 

Getting Americans understand need get used wearing masks always going harder Asian countries already norm people cold want catch one crowded trains would political issue all. fashion one could easily overcome. 

Somebody run commercials tough guy actors like Schwarzenegger wearing mask saying real men protect around them. wearing mask. Appeal macho mentality keeping lot men, around least, wearing them. lot men around they've framed ""I'm afraid nothin'!"" Nah, test it. 2020 whole ball game Live better part state Trump last night: ""the virus dissappear"" lol joke orange jello man is. eye pain left eye minor corona symptoms back March. I'm mostly fine occasional fatigue lingering cough. got antibody tested twice though negative times. coworkers ""If die, die"" attitude infuriate me. SJO website say flights? It’s apparently updated. healthcare system wasn’t even good begin with. People don’t Covid already avoiding routine hospital visits. ten day drop bugaloo He'll coronavirus testing 200 times. youve forever. Thanks immume system.

Luckily, coronavirus yet, weaken immume system staying inside wearing fresh air blockers/bacteria homes/face masks. way die easier faster. 

Thanks great government measures though, get great depression chaos come.
Imagine let virus deadly themselves.

Don't worry though, economy collapsed, theyll vaccinate us go back normal lives again! can't wait! There's telling virus long haul. ever really gets body. Os much smaller government rights. Right?

Irony people voted Tex governor, many say becasue believe small government. Yet also support Trump wants rule all. I've come realize articles talk US, exclude northeast Excellent point! Glad brought up. I’m sorry looks like cross-eyed dipshit holding Barbie clothes found garbage. Stuff leveled proportionally testing now, period June positive percentage increasing. Mostly uncontrolled spread Yakima. Find local store shop at, possible. incorrect. conflating crude mortality rate population infection fatality rate.

The CDC estimates 10-50 million flu infections year. That's \~10%, 5 6. COVID 248 times deadly flu, would kill 7.5 million people US.

No matter spin numbers, bad math. IFR influenza around 0.1%. Antibodies equal immunity. It’s perfectly common antibodies fade away immunity remain. That’s course certain it’s something unusual means I’m talking *different strains virus. Less risk shot stabbed Idt love USA really stands stand doctatorship fearmongering Stop treading store workers. Ah right, makes sense 2020. person responded made sound like guys haven’t tested previously like states. But... know... americans kinda deserved happening them. New York, still lot people believing virus hoax. even people still incredible stunts avoid wearing damn mask. virus running rampant country two things: 

An absence leadership

A lot idiots think wearing mask pandemic hill die on.  pandemic really allowed crazies come woodwork. think half people used social media accounts gone, completely nonsensical hatred conspiracy theory bullshit.

Turns takes crisis really see people's true colors. DeathSentence Excess deaths florida around 10,000 counting covid official count. Probably 8000 truly covid deaths compared 4 change report. yeah probably 50% definitely will, might President Biden Hey man- bathtub molly distributor, don’t take kindly that. Would count three cases one?.....asking President. wrong shrug bit hearing news considering slow respond news covid broke out? Worldometers, brought countries up. scorching 100% humidity, currently thunderstorming. ideal outside classes. whaaaaa!? wayyyyy! ... /s biotech, one’s making money patients hospital covid patients.

Reminds ""Covid Truthers"" saying infection numbers pumped hospitals wanted claim Covid money. completely ignored hospitals losing ton money elective surgeries done. can't nice things

Like outdoor concerts name one thing. Damn that’s like $6 per person... racquet  $100 week top, total. I'm advocating substantial decrease like pointing out. live conservative area liberal state (CA). pain real. I've bail couple regional FB groups assholery scroll past every day.

I like plot steal election. Right whole rest world it. pandemic, type people would eventually refuse wear masks others' safety quick call people ""snowflakes."" Turns out, types fucking assholes snowflakes along, especially masking virtually effortless, affront ego. won’t shop anymore. 7 day average daily death rate currently 829. April 2000 month peaked bit 2200s. love test vaccine people around world use girlfriend similar experience, negative result well. I’m *certain* it, it’s definitely strong possibility. did, must’ve myself, though never recall symptoms whatsoever... still, I’ve socially distancing older parents immune-compromised pregnant sister regardless. Ah missed one. yeah. four kids keep busy also cannot believe long since anywhere. sucks wish people would stop selfish. 1. still asked attended large gatherings. told stick script.

2. NYC outbreak, making tired old lie completely irrelevant. please get exact amount shitty things person officially okay wish death? mishandling crisis, rolling back environmental protections Amazon, encroaching Native land shitty towards LGBT people enough seems. OUI That’s true lol. actually hospital flu too. hospitalization death rate flu incredibly low, sure getting idea. understand flu much adept avoiding complications healthy people especially caught early.

Acting like anyway comparable novel coronavirus disingenuous best harmful worst. Yeah people die flu obviously, tens millions cases every year. Flu mortality almost always involves co-infection preexisting condition.

The point unknown scariest part novel coronavirus really doesn’t apply flu. Winning Fantasy Football League already pretty much luck based, deal players potentially getting sick missing couple weeks, even play season all. Yeah I'd save money you. universally masked? Look Melbourne, dumbasses thought they'd skip masks deep trouble. appreciate random anecdote, I'll take cues data... Easy now- don’t need kind inflammatory statement! I'm saying citations, I'm challenging assertion 'this science', way people challenge unfounded statements wikipedia.

That's [citation needed] is. amount PR compensation they'll get pull enormous. also conspiracy theorists claiming testing swabs infected, spreading infection. “doctor” idea she’s talking about. [I’m ready] How'd find out? Antibody test? so, since work store I'm dreading crowds grabby dingbats also slowly building up, instead make multiple trips take everything. types crowds spread virus create shortages. live Washington state, even close Seattle, mask usage north 95%. It’s still bootup phase believe it! Yes Fauci said wear masks, nay anti mask! Luckily Trump saw scheme best mask president ever! Trump's legacy. Scrolled far this. public lining get rushed vaccine. Even now, month. I'm surprised stayed, walk person mask nose. Like dickhead beggar today. Normally hand money stoplight, today ain't masked matey. profitable certainly profit hurting. goodwill alone worth companies. Maskless customers also risk worker safety... Right. Vaccine plus Tylenol better vaccine. there's 3 vaccines available, I'd pick non-tylenol one. types people vote rest us. know sounds silly son backwaiter Golf Club never shut pandemic. Today, came home reported Waiter come contact Saturday, tested positive. He, son, feels fine isolate days really concerned Club communicating anything members. in-laws (in 70s) members telling stay away awhile Corp runs Club anything. legal obligation notify members? IMO , also go deep cleaning son aware either.

Holy shit America fucked lol Fuck bats, save humans! I’d like see scientific study following blood gases course day wear mask
 (for 8-12 hours).

I’m masks, dude putting masks watching O2 saturation fun experiment, it’s science. similar HIV? Genuinely curious trying argumentative. business less 500. Right. entire hometown employer 500 know of. Maybe 1. act helps rural businesses, small business.

If includes schools districts, urban sity school teachers fucked rural school teachers much. Right? Okay thing. Deaths count towards county patient from... patients Tunica, Greenwood, Crittenton Ark, deaths ( even die hospital) count infection originated. many parts country studies showing 10-15 times many cases reported. NY estimating much 25% population, numbers reported 5-10%. get okay’d used replacements 95 type masks available. American Hospitals using KN95s needed last knew. Jeah kinda crule, fact americans always like ""eh america great superior country existence, countries pathetic"". joke world still people think way. 
And fact never anything ignorant stupid people country astonishing. Thats still shit us. Cause going drain claiming greatest best, litteraly nothing


But anyway, wrong person make fun of, really shitty situation. offended saddened way, sorry. Seriously. Maybe doesnt seem like it, really am. hole family/friends stay safe healthy.  u/undeleteparent Yes, I’m aware. 

At time, 20-40 (or worse) false negative rate, even small population pool, poor. 

The vast majorly Florida’s testing PCR antigen. numbers reported together (minus negatives). Antibody results reported separately.  talking about? *where* talking about? I'm scared catching virus, I'm scared family/friends catching it. Good luck man, hope feel better. Lol gonna happen. know guys wanna stay pillow fort forever let’s get real here. Please insulte Goldfish. Even longer attention span.  I'd say something comfort nothing magically make feel better. care though. oh mean get kids sick too? incredible. good thing allowed within 500 feet school cause certain they'd dumber hearing speak. Yeah, that's uncontrollable within test system itself. breakout, it’s yet. niece go real school ffs. going back lockdown, simple.

That may want happen, doubt actually will. ""The DeKalb mask ordinance also contains unique “conscientious objector” clause exempts person penalty swears written affidavit presented court, wear mask health-related, religious ethical reasons."" people natural resistance disease since they're **decedents** plague survivors.

This true, [being confer natural resistance plague. believe people say organ harvesting? sincerely want know far seen regard Falungong China Tribunal sponsored affiliated Falungong. Yes I'm 100% certain I'm saying indeed correct. quoting people symptoms flu.

This article comparing flu's CFR COVID's IFR, incorrect.

Most people symptoms common flu. 65%–85% population (unvaccinated) antibodies season's strain. correct; 9 - 45 million develop symptoms flu 221 - 289 million exposed year.

""CDC estimates influenza resulted 9 million – 45 million illnesses, 140,000 – 810,000 hospitalizations 12,000 – 61,000 deaths annually since 2010.""

The keyword can't compare apples oranges. Thank you!

Signed,

The Lazy I’ve spraying everything 99% ethanol/iso wiping goes freezer. stay wet etoh/iso 30 seconds work Exactly. Don’t worry won’t lose fucking handicapped True US issue goes far beyond Trump: political system entirely dysfunctional. two parties longer able work together even face global pandemic.

Merkel certainly better Trump, handle own. people involved levels government, federal local, political system general find solutions, handle situation best possible. Even private sector part help restructuring production help early spring shortages critical goods like disinfectant protective gear became issue.

Meanwhile, US inept federal government led idiot. state government varying degrees competence ranging decent like NY brain dead like Florida. media outlets spewing propaganda, contradicting scientists discernable reason. finally public that, large parts, believes people, amplifies insanity. Consequently, pretty straight forward way handling things turned absolute chaos. news outlets reporting ascertainment ratio topline number instead actual prevalence estimate?? outdated now, ascertainment ratio April almost totally meaningless today... Everyone’s going get sick Shit right sincerely happy you. real. like good portions country also also fully acknowledge there’s many fucking things wrong it. referring Loss Prevention. store undercover security, least store worked in. DeathSantis 24 times higher would mean 96 million people US contracted, supposedly closing almost herd immunity. seems unlikely? Especially given transmission rate? Lived China couple years, sex Ed Asia joke lmao talking about?

Here’s source don’t want take word mean live that's pretty much happened. list essential stuff relatively long, people could reasonably tolerate. Beer weed friends. I'm clear Covid. Works like charm. wear mask puffs chugs. flu causes things California 4x less deaths roughly number cases comparison New York?

Ideally, looking reliable sources / analysis looked DETAIL come data based conjectures.

My source WorldoMeters 1point3acres.

There couple causes think of:

1. NY sharp spike cases short period time, day \~33 getting \~2x (500+ cases per million) CA (225 cases per mil). overwhelmed medical system ready. 
2. testing totally time, actual number cases way higher indicated. would point lower CFR/IFR. study NY suggested this.
3. different strains virus dominating coast prominent one CA less deadly. Seen anecdotal data.
4. viral load infected people less based combination PPE, social distancing, cases emerge petri dish type activities/places (e.g. hospitals).
5. weather something it. virus ""weaker"" since warmer. purely wild conjecture.
6. learned treat virus better. Hospitalizations level NY step deaths would seem indicate support this. 

Any potential causes sources back hypotheses?

 
Cheers love Dr Fauci respond publicly Trump’s stupid comments. Like voice reason remind Trump stupid is. Places protests spikes don’t really tell us much own. plenty protests Boston cases flat. ""The neighborhoods included Miami urbanized area [massive economic disparities exist within different Hispanic communities.

She osteopath. virologist, epidemiologist. proponent 'holistic medicine' whatever is.

People like ex want believe everything conspiracy. Probably understand video confirmed wanted believe. many people like nowadays...

edit: revise said second viewing, talking genetics, genome specifically think, maybe misheard that, video even shocking, starts talking Bill Gates pivots talking brain 'your thoughts', also compares MMR vaccine (there still people that??) mean come on... tests hideously high false negative rates. mean, sort unavoidable. asymptomatic presympomatic like got infected recently, might enough virus sample get successful test. can't even possibly get positive tests day infected, means get infected, tested next day, get negative back week means virus far enough along give positive. last weeks infection. Considering theme parks Florida operating, likely won’t disclose staff sick. mean really, really sick. could put number exactly many employees currently virus say department park immune pandemic. departments upwards fifty people positive COVID, others 12-20 per attraction. number give take recent COVID leaves taken coming week. HR forbids disclosure employee testing results anyone, seems advise departments tell remaining staff employee ""on vacation.""  funny that's guy meant said football, lmao.

Look NY NJ Connecticut Mass many many others compare infection rates right various countries. Gonna need citation heard anywhere they're foregoing safety testing. Lol first line made seem like referencing comment Bolsonaro. rates ten times higher means there’s roughly 40 millions cases US, ~10-15% population.

We need 80% minimum get herd immunity effects. reach percentage normal inoculation (IE spreading virus, vaccinate) almost 1,000,000 people die.

This herd immunity solution without vaccine viable. many people die. That’s deaths 1918 pandemic.

Wake fuck people guarantee, im 36 fine opportunities afforded system. figured it'll end yearly shot like flu. DIY stores making killing soft lockdown. 

They're one bright spots retail, along liquor gun stores. test medical personnel back March.
now virus deep throatswabs work. confirm gets less less cycle duration also shorter cycle.
I ""healed"" certain point. 2 days average (and feel fine concerning alarming tgat moment) however Covid immediately rebounced. harder last couple cycles!
so means awfully limited options even pruning bit garden considered ""hard work"" 🤔 need national standard like Canada. bought 20 surgical masks crazy around February. took month arrive. manufacturer listed cause deals site. came able verify met Canadian standard surgical masks. 

Then armed forces bought millions defective ear guards like 7 years ago. kinda hard avoid problems. I’m mistaken news dropped right one family members getting trouble. Diversion. chuckled nose. could. wrong asking. Sorry trouble you.  According [pew average anti-vaxxer low income white. I'm sorry somewhere along line, probably insults others others me, point lost. last paragraph exactly I'm saying. I'm means trying give free passes people anxiety. think that's getting abused along stores afraid mandate masks fear getting sued someone medical condition.

What I'm saying make face coverings mandatory would include masks shields. situation can't see anyone leg stand saying can't wear either/or. I'm anti-mask, think shields better masks, think making option makes easier get everyone covering face.

My point heartless people say others wear masks considerate others considerate edge cases actually breathing issues.

Sorry dick, getting alot hate thought better situation trying get point across know people feel suffocating mask anti science people hate told do. I'm trying come something compromise nothing.  TP still rationed live. Preach brother Pennsyltuckians. I’m planning moving North hopes finding Union encampment. some, others look like second waves. Waves tend look like steps! Hospitals losing millions dollars revenue coronavirus taking away resources profitable procedures. father doctor salary essentially cut half pandemic. Also, hospitals don’t profit vaccinations. Pharmaceutical biotech companies do. Damn, already past 6k deaths today, last time happened beginning June highly recommend checking podcast ""Knowledge Fight"" Spotify. break tons Alex Jones nonsense science hard facts. episodes go back years I'm sure could find looking *any* time ex comes garbage. excerpt:

Early whole northeast, Chicago, Detroit among worst hit areas. it’s south California. 

While right certainly isn’t good necessarily, neither trend, think we’re downplaying bad April was. testing capability now, it’d appear obvious widespread was. 

Hospitalizations one best metrics see it’s spreading (lagged is) [CDC weekly paints much worse picture April. happened every single place hit hard virus. say China doesn’t respect people’s privacy. ""And so, fellow Americans: ask country you—ask country""

I guess could also said: ""wear mask, fool!"" think going need wear masks , keep business closed forever. Continue social distance engage people. Indefinitely. least let’s give 10 years right thing together. Omg guys still saying Yes. Yes can. hate America less hate ignorant people sides. foundational level America allowed go dirt poor extremely successful. Nothing handed work ass off. yeah agree lot sentiments regarding inefficacies government, living America largely amazing. seem indirectly talking herd immunity. human biological response virus (common strain different) *negative*. Even covid-19 symptoms mild none, unforeseen health consequences (in pulmonary, cardiovascular, nervous systems; perhaps more). yet understand virus. need understand situation rush blindly fire. ~~Wisdom and~~ Prudence better brute courage. Meanwhile, Finland recent confirmed covid death [around 25 days think going get worst him? 80% people test positive asymptomatic means there's high chance he'll fine. I'm trying downplay virus since significant amount people still dying/suffering it, doubt he's going learn lessson Presidents power lead example assemble teams people figure deal pandemic. know deaths reported know 100% percentages actually are. Chrump publicly insulted people wearing masks months suddenly patriotic plummets polls. WIC used online. sucks Lol would selective one sure. cant even put jail officials violates quarantine protocols turn blind eye failure Health secretary arrested Yes, double confirmed antibody tests two others sphere developed symptoms time (all us within week other).

We didn’t really think recently February still super early US. % applies every country absolutes generally exist. always find outliers. done week 2 yet? Much worse me, case fairly mild. Capacity without size population served even percentage beds full really convey much information. three supposedly hardest hit counties look ""good"" compared small counties cases lot ICU beds start with. false negatives still worse

Can give evidence? article said mild fever days since dissipated. That's ton per capita. Brazil going face huge number deaths coming weeks.  Kloooop. like wearing cloth masks pre-covid 19 studies thoroughly done peer reviewed compared studies promote cloth masks, flaws found methods studies saying effective are. saying masks warn, cloth masks effective advertised. 650,000 people die flu every year worldwide. another escaped Hoosier- chiming big don’t it. NY horrible testing early on, meaning missed massive amount cases weren’t prepared this. biggest reason difference numbers. can’t really draw solid conclusions besides NY ton cases officially counting. 

Look positive test rates NY March/April it’s really obvious missed massive amounts cases time. want avoid fogging need airtight mask. Elastic means ears hurt. comfortable ones valve means protection others. cover cloth paper mask protect others. agree saying, initial claim. encourage use hospitalizations per capita main covid metric comparable across time regions. Confirmed cases skewed time change tests/capita comparable across regions different testing/capita levels. favorite website look per capita data state (tests, cases, hospitalizations, deaths) talking mentioned masks. 

Please tell Canada.

Get fuck bullshit. COVID-19 serious disease get serious people. That's main problem. 90%+ people who'll get fine, many undermine seriousness everyone else. 10% get serious due it, family/friends (and too) acknowledge serious really is. sure call tell bother.  think Americans already tracked via phones, crazy. NSA admitted it. thought ploy put tracking devices people ridiculous. Bill Gates gain it? guy everything world wants unleash deadly viruses people produce vaccines chips vaccines track people....sure lot upside gain see there. Real incentive want this.......

LOL TROLLS COMICAL think mean military curfew-style lockdown, movements strictly limited groceries &amp; medicine. going exercise, business, errands, etc. includes shuttering vast majority deemed ""essential"" sectors. company 3% raises already books come March, eliminated 401k contributions account 4% ones salary.

That said, *kith* ! I'm starting believe Karma actual real thing. better careful say Ha. Prez US MuRiCa !!! assume?

Quote know that. Immunity still researched. [An article Antibodies last body limited time T-cells take over. coronaviruses immunity documented 17 years.  reason think one different.  Reinfections documented. Every one seen attributed false positive earlier false negative after.  tests ain't great. Even anecdotal reinfections, absolutely evidence re-infection significant scale. sure one way another, sure one thing, standing shoulder shoulder outside protesting isn’t dangerous, sitting shoulder shoulder outside cheering favorite sports team isn’t either. common air condition Israel? everyone heads inside scotching middle-eastern sun breathes chilled recirculated air, might explain uptick. No, death rate computed reported deaths end April. real death rate bit higher, since people infected end April died May.  Oh wow way don’t even know got number from! Thanks!

The “infotainment” nationalism zelotry news last 30 years completely destroyed people’s ability decipher facts real science rumors context bending half truths. ask question every day. Eh, debatable, regardless masks mandated weeks ago, immediately shut downs lifted.

Whatever though, glad finally something was(and still are) significantly worse ideal, much 10% false positives. However, false negatives still worse, especially considering similar symptoms Covid-19, early tests come back negative within first week contracting virus.  low skilled worker education.

But US actually something results. Donald Trump right one thing: USA done tremendous amount testing. that, results pretty much ignored. cases, serious contact tracing, serious masking, serious lockdowns.

So, testing using result good. Testing waiting miracle ridiculous. lot words English borrowed languages, often aquire additional nuance implications usage part original word. Lolol amazing country live in?

Lol homework. one assumed shit. Even commented would irrelevant point lol

If say Canada going laugh ass off. Thank you. sick apocalypse clickbait shit. Here's Ohio's latest case/death pretty well, cases spiking deaths rising bit.

Property taxes suck.

They suck less California states (like Texas), they're basically regressive wealth tax hits middle class poor harder rich.

One reason love California afford house here. house Texas, I'd worry able afford taxes.

Income tax? Sales tax? care, definition enough money pay income tax (and bad), make sales taxes low want spending less.

""Low tax"" states need funding, too, rearrange make room marketing slogan. ""Low tax"" means low income tax.

Quick retirement arithmetic:

Assume $20k per year health insurance. $300k house Texas, might pay $10k property taxes retirement.

So, initial retirement expenses going cost living *plus* $30k per year. obeying 4% rule (make retirement funds last spending 4% per year), looking $750k saved cover initial taxes medical expenses.

You lack empathy. We've seen Wuhan January February, entire households wiped out, kids surviving alone. Seven months later story changed. Source impotence? Damn. That’s fucked :( need wait there's vaccine. need wait case numbers get back control. we'd held one month back beginning, could achieved then. Now, going take longer, we're still talking period month two most. Ohio. mean much. Police county told enforce mask mandate, likely case counties outside big cities. disturbing amount Ohioans still think masks ploy control population. It’s also sad 2%-3% infected doesn’t seem like “big deal”. Trust it’s rare people live house filled 16 people especially it’s 11 kids. 

Assuming 2 couples 1 guy single (who mentioned pissed kid sick). means 2 couples 10 kids.

It pretty safe say 3-5 kids it’s literally fucking impossible truly poor giving birth 5 America.

Unlikely it’s house filled 5 single parents way unlikely. point, would questioning people. single average higher 2 kids per parent lot. Also renting home big unlikely bigger - 4 bedroom. Pretty sure parents sharing bedrooms.

Worth noting IFR snapshot look future outcomes active cases study.  

The study showed 61% infections active sample population. sample representative full population, virus still active 61% (about 115,000) estimated 188,000 cases.  

If percentage 115,000 active cases died 73,000 completed cases, actual fatality rate around 1.5%. didn’t answer question racist, bigot. Maybe post attempt solicit posters name important figures, groups three, made similar claims? cool, Jethro Granny told listen fancy city slicker doctors, sun wind kill Covid-19 keep everyone safe, like Florida.


/s tag line better : ""It takes one tenga"" Sure. Point risk level.  much misinformation....still. think we're saying things. mutates slowly, vaccines targeting binding proteins virus, vaccines useful long time (thus mutation-resistant). 

Maybe worded poorly first time. 

The main concern terms eradication long good immunity 1st generation vaccines? need boosters every year, still get infected (just sick) still pass virus, yea... eradication going difficult. lost it, guys. Heard mom AZ died giving birth. told fiance everything would okay....This okay. 25! toddler five year old asking crying. :(

Edited - died COVID. indicates kids less likely *diagnosed*, yeah. agree that. seen much way testing data tests, positive negative, broken age.

When Florida recently released data, showed positivity rate 30% among 54,000+ children tested far, even though overall positivity rate 20% state. lot reasons could be, points fundamental reality actually know real rate is.

If kids make 23.2% state 10% *diagnosed* cases, might good. However, make 10% diagnosed cases 1% tests, could really bad. That's especially tricky already know symptoms present differently children, doctors deciding whether test child based criteria decide adult already know data unintentionally systematically altered. washington opened gyms experiencing increase similar others states. thurston county got phase 3 spike even though gym opened unlike counties stuck p2 1. let’s blame weed.

Of course prison technically housing slavery legal prisoners 13th amendment really get both. Fauci said back in...April? “We don’t determine reopen, virus does”. Trump allies didn’t like all. Yeah, turns viruses can’t ignored. don’t care politics got important election coming up. mention it, believe parts Florida something similar. total absence coordinated federal response tragedy highest order... then, solid source? Perhaps used birth control couldn’t support family. Great job keeping conversation civil.

It’s clear speak emotion point engaging you. What's wrong people? Tf. breaking news 11 US? never Fed bought whatever could. wonder much 2.3T left. Says guy made assumption blame Trump literally first sentence first comment. Looks like need basic lessons learning read too. jury still those. 

For memory, think lack focus call. It’s doctor speaking responding information isn’t registered brain. ""May"" they've facing shortages since beginning ok [""Texas ranks 3rd best state America **for businesses** survive COVID think that's stupid, tone-deaf thing gov. tweet we're loading corpses refrigerator trucks, get load commenters think aborted lockdown attempt make-believe mask order wild government overreaches.

Thanks. New Orleans high desert? I'm asking question clarify something me. mean?I'm American I'm asking job security able call sick/take vacations. 👏 👏 ""I'm quite whack yet."" COVID tests actually test for? inconsistent ? getting deliveries since March it’s great.

I’d little hesitant all-out ban customers coming store though. grandmother interested getting groceries delivered ordering website hard understand. sure could accommodate people like unless start taking bunch phone calls, order sheet, etc. IFR factors asymptomatic people though. Asymptomatic people significantly less likely die develop symptoms. Poo-tee-weet? misinformed. actually pretty sad many people lack education understand.

Once Trump gone, conversation shift damage. like either, hate trump reason put head sand.

The UN already documented current damage predicted wide spread, long term implications.  US can't accept yet. anti vaxxer makes frightened abiut rushed vaccine. News reportd coming millions vaccines already made, waiting trials finish ship next day. long term effects still misunderstood. misdiagnosed sir. 

They fact anal worts entire society. Yeah, nobody likes quitter.

/S too. larger responsibility falls upon larger businesses help keep smaller businesses afloat providing assistance.

If healthier people obligation keep at-risk populations safe wearing masks/social distancing, apply businesses. psychotic corporatist model somehow treats separately, convinces many people insane sub people economy somehow completely separate. Corporations course want us believe continue exploit. hell claim anxiety tell people fears real? go around claustrophobic's tell get shit together walls actually caving them? stop tool.

i never said let whatever want said give option wear face shield. afraid around people without mask use contactless delivery yourself, hell guys dense can't see ridiculous double standard have. signing $2 billion deal supply experimental coronavirus vaccine U.S., [Pfizer [BioNTech setting price ceiling less $20 dose impact much companies charge protect people Covid-19.

Sounds fishy Correct. It’s basic game theory. Yes. Asymptomatic people less likely die get symptoms. Small pox completely extinct worldwide, polio spreading Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nigeria rural communities. possible wipe next decades, there's barriers overcome like lack medical infrastructure distrust foreign medical organizations. No. fear. fear damage false narrative do, ie Trump's ability *to claim* right/has expertise one issue results claiming expertise areas ignorant people assuming correct claims, fuels crisis pushes death toll up. plenty karma burn, people can't figure /s that, is.

Please wear mask idiot. poor crime America?


Oh wait actually lmao. Let's see q-anon crowd argue way one. thought Trump secretly fighting sex-trafficking? Well, flagship years ago may features like cheap(er) phone. phone that's 400 dollars cheaper bought compares release. Cost living much less UK. study definitely needed. I've seen enough anecdotes suggest cardiac abnormalities way limited older patients, merely anecdotes someone proper study.

I think get studies looking mild cases among younger people, findings may well cause panic. disparities COVID deaths excess mortality among younger age groups point cardiac injury common occurrence, speculation - least see study examines causes death among young people whose deaths excess. expect MI, stroke, aneurysm.

More study needed ten times over, hundred times even. shocked [autopsy run PCR tests samples taken organ tissues kidneys... reason Astra Zeneca’s stock [is related Covid Im sorry loss. 

I bought gas mask, chem suit, hydration pack minuscule hope level protection outperforming hospital PPE, parents get sick, hospital let them. bought SGE 400/3 drinking system, CBR X Camelbak, MIRA protection suit.

I post case anyone idea wants know buy. think bigger issue much opened up, guidelines open many people ignored. ""shit's open, life's back normal"" seemed immediate response entering phase reopening, people just......didn't things asked make reopening work. Restaurants fucking table spacing, workers flatly ignoring distancing mask guidelines, secret church services, BARS...... can't tell many too-large, no-mask private gatherings gone state despite order permitting reopening called for. 

IF actually followed guidelines letter, wonder would done.... welcome.  absurd, laughably ridiculous, clearly politically-biased really ashamed repeating it. luxury cutting back work hours take care educate kids, would say it. love idea homeschooling, going suck (while working part time) safety health family. idea. could train cab.

You're angry trying make feel bad work.

However believe mandate gives higher compliance suggestion It’s like USA systemically set make virus bad possible. Working intended btw. lol he's favorite player tho. Old counterstrike 1.6 handle begging someone else make decision take responsibility. 

No haven't. They've begging Federal government alleviate NATIONAL bottleneck testing. They've asking Federal government help coordinate make sure supplies testing kits get they're needed most. They've asking Federal government stop competing PPE essential equipment. York got coronavirus control first time took action. Donald trump didn’t anything slow coronavirus nyc still got slowed. 

Yes did, tens thousands died across region. shouldnt governors NY, CT, NJ, band together develop coordinated regional response complete absence Federal one. 

You're right wait next year, that's exactly we're going Trump completely abdicating responsibility whatsoever. 4K upper safe daily limit, RDA. There's almost certainly safety factor that, good reason. recommending doses anything unless doctor. Also, Brazil, developed country, best standard quality life healthcare system. Granted president would better care. Corruption/mistakes thing too. He's pretty old 65. Yes didn’t bedridden. appeared 4 days later runny nose KN95 similar effectiveness, right? not, I'm going disappointed, ordered several them, lol. sometimes wonder it'd worthwhile least individuals higher risk oximeter? worked retail manager upon time, well support positions require enforcing policies. understand picking battles, gotta consistent. inconsistency mask enforcement causes specific problem. avoiding one battle, started whole new war.

That excuse people assholes, consistency give manager ammunition honestly say, ""This rule, everyone follow it, we're enforcing way everyone."" Sorry loss. majority Filipinos work healthcare I’m surprised 😔 abandon local grocery stores stuff like this. staff kinda sorta mask thing (noses out), taking life hands going battle customers. even premature deaths, higher risk future heart disease cancer. thing wrecks havoc internal organs ACE2 receptors, cells destroyed need grow back heal (some grow back quickly readily others may require stem cell types regenerative therapy) !RemindMe 1 month realistically capable so, would seriously move. can’t imagine living far right community - say someone self-describes “center-left moderate”. mean respectfully possible, amazing needed 'study' this. relatively risk free manufacturers though. deals involve purchase going ahead, regardless phase 3 results. small price governments pay potential vaccines horizon. ""scientists"" ruled unequivocably thousands people congregating streets weeks end perfectly safe. Coronavirus woke, afflict obey narrative. suggest otherwise is, course, racist. elderly, highest risk group severe complications think point gives justification kick passenger saw without mask, they're trying track everybody. 

Also, number people going follow policy even enforcement low last thing want headache rearranging trip. Ok, time COVID. think really fair compare retail workers deal now. Confronting somebody without mask legitimately putting risk catching life threatening disease. 

Again, like inconsistency get it. workers put horrible position selfish anti mask people.  recommends it, sheep sure wear it. might actually able get next year.  states yes, would qualify unemployment Yes, outcome goes deductive inductive reasoning equally likely one supported germ theory observed data. clogging ruining run grocery store. Hang sucker week reuse pretty safely. guy regular miss cleo close friend is. nurse 6 years, base pay around $40 hour. Working around 5 hours overtime week almost makes six figures. celebration going left. basically commercial democrats. say like China central quarantine facilities? There's middle ground putting positive cases somewhere like this, one. Even cutoff subsidized quarantine hotel rooms made people someone high risk cohabitating them, would make huge difference. Even run lottery actually gets one rooms, would still worth it... Proven false cupcake attempt tho trying argue difficult? isn't.

A shocking amount commercial farming already extensively automated. John Deere one largest robotics companies world. technologies starting trickle commercial applications strong cost driver today.

My uncle saying masks don’t work generally conspiracy guy, wearing mask goes stores (a bit mandatory) lives grandmother high-risk aunt. doesn’t leave house anything else. made comprehensive list places product could kill corona virus? Personally, I'm interested mouth, would like know effectiveness kitchen surfaces agar plates. comment proof expect average idiot properly dissect information. can't process experience everybody's. hard time getting it, understand everybody else making big fuss it. 

I expect fairly good overlap people insist racism/sexism exist they've never felt receiving ends, seen it, exist. come studies. Immigrants.  That's easy politically already killed many elderly population.

Harder US. Anyone else surprised twisted words again? Sooo..... Black Death Friday then?? disagree. look numbers deaths categories (Pneumonia, heart disease, heart attack, organ failure, influenza, ect.) see uncanny spike. numbers intentionally skewed seem like things bad looked. 

By end going see ugly results. 2020 census going something else.. see demise many counties populated areas. Loss doctors, nurses, teachers, engineers. Understaffed businesses ect. Boris Johnston good wasn’t. even behaved like human sympathy weeks thanks use word ""orphan"" correctly. claimed children two living parents killed covid count orphans. 100% factually wrong. embarrassing pedantic clearly wrong. Well, still tens thousands die flu every year. 9-year-old girl Northeast Florida youngest COVID-19 related death state, according data released Florida Department Health Wednesday.

The girl, lived Putnam County, recent travel history known contact confirmed case.

She first reported COVID-19 related child death Northeast Florida area.

Only five patients aged 17 younger died related coronavirus: 17-year-old Pasco County boy, 16-year-old Lee County girl, 11-year-old Miami-Dade County boy 11-year-old Broward County girl. make sense unless knew beforehand would contract Chinese virus 2019.

She known.

She support kids. went work. socially distance rest lives. Political figures want numbers lowered, hospitals want higher. Honestly, unless get thing control, can’t imagine taking kids door door reach communal pot candy. state’s numbers increasing ever steadily one seems care. Good thing kids young know they’re missing. s9 im pretty sure s20 does. water counter samsung health app talking Sweden, could someone explain Worldometers numbers work?

For countries, take total cases previous day add today's new cases, get today's total cases.

For instance, Belgium, today July 22, 64094 + 164 = 64258

Sometimes, rarely, numbers get adjusted, there's notice bottom page explaining it.

For Sweden, that's happens. Every day, frequently, there's jump, couple hundred more, never explanation.

So again, using today example, 78166 + 132 = 78504 !!

What gives? Extracting wealth workers funneling straight top. always. Possible symptom. SARS-Cov-2 virus respiratory virus, meaning tends primarily target use respiratory system, exclusively. uses primarily, exclusively, targets ACE-2 receptor, possible receptors, ACE-2 receptor everywhere. potentially cause stuff like kidney failure.  based data statistics? looks like it’s extremely biased chart. Air travel shouldn’t category concerts. It’s part truth.

You can’t separate actions reality environment in.

There less infections because:
- early stages (the infection rate exponential, smaller initial number slower spread)
- state emergency, schools closed, large malls, cinemas sports venues closed, curfew restaurants entertainment districts well shops close early afternoon.
- Companies favored WFH staggered hours much higher rate (it dropped lot now)
- Pretty much one went unless essential shopping (I live Shibuya, eerie walk crowded crossing world see completely empty, weekends)

Now, since lifting state emergency, restrictions over, including large sports gathering.

Schools even talking reducing summer vacations pressure put “attendance”, learning.

Companies pressure perform, including longer hours strongly discouraging WFH.

Trains crowded again.

And it’s summer, like flu, UVs reducing airborne viruses stronger immune system = asymptomatic infections, contrary winter it’s easy feel weather isolate reduce infections.

Finally, spread large enough, government STRONGLY testing means free card infections increase unburdened. legal company fire you’re waiting test results “it took long”? wish 100 come august Texas. Houston city grew air conditioning became popular. pretty much nothing crying? charity moves people California midwest? article rewritten every days real life equivalent hiding zombie bite. We're high risk family got decent oximeters couple months ago. trick check periodically sick know normal meter, tell dropping. Careful comrade, following narrative. might need censored reeducated. Well seeing woman lives poverty reason she’s cuz she’s poor, doubt 10,000$ fine help situation all. What’s really stupid is, people applied won’t get $600 weekly payment. see sides debate extending needs done. cases falling states weren’t shutting I’d say don’t extend it. However gotten way worse since July people going need help. tell one thing though, person that’s White House won’t November. Probably time mentioned people brigading sub. Theyre long gone thankfully tho, couldnt bring patience would also let handle pandemic properly xd checked see listed sensors. phone $200 years ago. love it. care drop it. point. know plenty people can't afford it. know government magical entity grant unemployment benefits enough worth sustain current living. there's gotta way spread, right? Mask wearing, working remotely possible, etc. lot studies mean Alot Yeah, Sweden's decline began April despite late winter. Yes agreed, frustrating. lag time getting test results still poor well. looks like CA drove Hospitalizations today I'm Irvine go see lot people wearing masks.. also rarely leave apartment now.  Honestly I’m sure. 
The KN95 denote Chinese version N95 understand. Great less people give vaccine ;-; free net-negative society. People work pay taxes already bought this. never said decisions educated. reopening Texas clearly effort restore sales taxes. talk Sweden? confused Sweden. 

I can’t find good data analysis this, occasional editorial either condemning lauding plan. example, [this USA Today focuses bad numbers (and *are bad*) ignores dwindling death rate. Sweden declining COVID death rate trend since April, zero deaths Friday July 17. trend cases also consistently decreased since mid-June. experiment obviously heavy death toll (which quite clear relative neighboring countries), COVID situation seemingly improved significantly? hit herd immunity, despite 10% antibody presence? apparently don’t wear masks Sweden, things help?

I add promise I’m bullshit conspiracy theorist, physician honestly don’t understand trend represents, don’t know tell patients/family/friends *are* bullshit conspiracy theorists. sorry, hard see what's joke  Happens ages. overwhelms you. seems people rest hearts give in. hard race body made it.  cold comfort. knew system, knew Republicans cheat ""slight"" victory enough. yet lots lots American's lazy even bother voting. 

I'm sad American's continue allow Republican's ruin country. I'm fighting way. recognize history reflect ""American's"" kept republicans power. reality need face it. true all. give snapshot situation now, useful. bet 500k read economic data.

Sweden sucking wind, neighbors.

You live bizarro Fantasyland Sweden faring better. evidence whatsoever.

If anything, rest Scandinavia better shape, open borders Swedes kept out. nations get back normal, Sweden isolated neighboring economies. Dumb idea. Instead following cautious responsible COVID-19 model motorsports like F1, course Indy car put tens thousands people risk. Stop spreading calm porn, that's much dangerous Pandemic. currently movements censor coronavirus numbers, presumably theyre damn high. theyre falsifying falsified numbers? Honestly, even religious congregations boggle mind. put pagan satanic mass rituals hold safety community, can't religious groups it?  mean US pay even turn needed? example someone else develops vaccine faster one effective. think parents would able live close quarters me. respond personal attacks point out. Thanks Oscar. doubt experts clear head, doubt reliability. Feels good company dipshits. :( wth, im slowly losing faith humanity. hope that’s case Yeah probably doesn’t solve lack empathy. However blunt effectiveness Fox News astroturfing gaslighting public voting self-interests. 

Just getting people vote self-interest would huge improvement status quo. (Universal healthcare, progressive taxes, etc)

Getting people vote benefit larger community country... don’t know that, assuming it’s even possible. doubt that’s accurate. can’t find good data it, COL UK 6% lower US, Mississippi significantly lower rest US. get it, everything wrong everything still went wrong sounds like played enough data able find something noteworthy. Lol what? idea even referencing. links daily discussion thread. Yes, trackers use CDC reports change data fact - worldometer changed count USA several times basis CDC reports. administration theoretically manipulate tracker's data fact. roughly one third american redditers believe number according this.  admit less satisfying less good prompt prosecution. worthwhile matter long takes, though, shows everyone criminals corrupt people held accountable actions, matter long takes. 

In fact, taking longer find prosecute side - means effort stays public's consciousness longer would everything quickly. Neighboring countries still seeing fewer deaths though... Sweden still seeing effects disastrous decisions shut things down. another good certain point, reasonable person might say ""Why bother?""

We're past now. family friend share video facebook...talking GMO's vaccines ""Transhumanism""...How even try counter claim/ conversation sort thing. woman identifies ""Dr Carrie Meyer (unsure spelling). get responses shit just...help mass reporting it? comments full ""Thanks sharing truth patriot"" Crap...this shit sad.

 Serious question: What's difference narcissism selfishness? ""The DJ would play two songs girls would dance stages. Guys able throw money. buckets put ones in, sit car social distancing."" Automatic transmission required. amazes many comments keep reading today saying “looks like peaked.” 

We ain’t seen nothin yet schools reopen. necessarily call 56% increase nearly doubling. Something fishy. Watching sports high risk haven’t traced cases BLM protests? be? US esentially lost 2 months progress. rate wont 2nd wave winter first wave still going on. absurd Bernie left. need moderate Democrat. guys told deaths would surge two weeks ago date. 3 weeks hit lowest daily death tot

Deaths surging. Care eat crow admit wrong? wish conclusive data this. fully believe lot people ongoing issues, many cases around world, ""a lot"" 50,000 people, still *relatively* rare. ""a lot"" million people, much scarier.

I personally know 4 people who've tested positive recovered fine, know thats meaningless sample size. I'm glad did. downvotes are... numerous.. lack better word. sure watching propaganda closely.

The truth keep uploading cannot control ~ Yes, long live good middle-class neighborhood USA, schools generally great. long afford college want shoulder massive debt even get adult life started, generally great too.

""Most people"" - again, assume live neighborhood worry rights much.

The word describe point view called ""privileged"".  need studies scientists indeed hypothesize viral load initial exposure correlated disease severity. Example: We'll see soon enough truckers start refusing go south.
They park rigs thats that.
All USA hot spot, certainly qualifies.

In end individual decide safe them, hell gov says. quit find another driving job...or protest (here's kicker bud...the smart way) border transfer station setup US drivers drop load Cdn driver picks up. simple...yet seem insistent forced (in fashion, whipping? Caning? Taking away class 1 refusal perhaps?) long hauls deep USA.

We're slaves, half stupid them. charging 100%. Seriously, though, reason former Disney employees call ""Mouseschwitz.""

To clear, think comparing conditions Disney World Auschwitz bad look, best. really go around trivializing Holocaust.

But meme comes real angst caused decades pretty terrible treatment many workers.

Side note trivia: cast member ever tells ""have Disney day"" that's Disney speak ""fuck you."" subtext, guess, ""Disney"" day would awful one. Sick 2 days sick months counting?

Fine, give 2 days. I'll pop acetaminophen till done. I'll find nice mass gathering enjoy. confused woman pictured posters. Standing people trying preserve public health pandemic bullies toxic masculinity? guess that's then. Headline writers rejoice would fairly simple verify epidemiology big correlation initial infection load severity. People living home would far greater chance receiving low dose community somebody lives multi-person house receives household member intimate partner. see chance severity differ dramatically comparing single people living people multi-person households. know internal numbers really really bad claimed Chris Wallace interview “we polls showing I’m ahead every single swing state”. 

Trump goes *biggest* lies even narcissism isn’t able hide truth him. Gonna need really loud I’m Long Beach Belmont Shore. I’m seeing 2nd street packed people beach packed people. keep saying going happen I'm still saying it.

It’s happening. proven unreliable. Attempted murder charge? not, fuck country! bad idea, started something like lockdown Europe. ordered delivery groceries, even go store two months. Anti-social behavior plain simple.

These people malignant cluster b personality disorders. 

Narcissism sociopathy. Get familiar using terms. faster Americans realize culture puts people pedestal reinforces anti-social behaviors people participate behavior, betterment society future. what’s alternative explanation? Looking study, stockpiling defined “Stockpile bigger amounts food [e.g., flour, milk, eggs, canned goods]; Stockpile cleaning disinfecting supplies [e.g., wipes, toilet paper, soap, spirit, etc.]; Stockpile protective measures [e.g., gloves, masks]”) 

But stockpiling loosely defined here. people might buying stuff first time ever long time. people (our family included) buying bit time go less often. beginning shortages, lot supply issues straightened out. better question might ask people buying 4x 5x needed x amount time.

That said, outcome study surprising far principles go. Oh boy, well...you would probably prefer know, since asked I’ll direct r/amibeingdetained Trump never share podium again.  Yeah, unfortunately Fauci's statements probably misled even reasonable people would otherwise convinced. 

Those walking around talking masks taking amendments convinced anything, matter many PhDs.

However, could convinced likely listen doctor's opinion masks. Honestly, I'm disappointed lies mask effectiveness. pulled thing Netherlands effects lingering. place good mask compliance public transport illegal ride without mask. Japanese build things efficiently still use FAX machines late 80s.  dont get americas fucking wet dream. slow stable pandemic easily transferable. would, governemnt, want every single ounce data possible transmission rates. keeps fucking wear mask dont wear mask, like data skewed worthless century type ordeal. One thing sure, worse, know could definately count matter what.

I'm okay traipse long done safely. oil would fighting lot harder now. Industrial Military Complex never give \~$60B. happening. DOA. hate say it, moment Trump said would right eventually going away moment actually thought Covid might never completely go away. We'll get better dealing vaccination efforts reduce spread, I'm thinking Trump jinxed us short-lasting immunity. many U.S. citizens residents symptomatic--actually feeling unwell--right now?  Wrong. They’ve started. Yes, [ONS report acknowledges recency June number deaths causes generally lower five-year average, exceptions beginning month; however, number death occurrences increase receive death registrations.

Even happens, seems like expect additional reports bring mortality rate match 5-year receive death registrations, number death occurrences may rise five-year average days June 2020.

So seems even everything fully counted, whole month little excess mortality. find surprising think people would given scary headlines we're still seeing regularly. wondered could hear pigs screaming pain.

Initially hog said masks, surgeon general say masks, disrupted supplies, he’s saying wear mask. 


Too little late dotard, response like doctor ignores dying patient family shows up, putting oxygen cannula corpse shitty attempt make look like tried. fat fuck doesn’t even care lives lost lives ruined medical bills unemployment, wants keep spoiled, nothing ass White House. place publicly called “dump”. I’m personally two weeks away insulting people instead continuing pose potential explanations

Here’s big fat “told so” 2 weeks later. 🤦‍♀️

🖖😷 want know actually answers polls. better things time, like waste Reddit! Smh. RNC next month well. not. apologise. I've long day hospital I'm physically mentally exhausted everything that's going on. heard Fox News virus Democrat Fauci aware lot things. want know actually answers polls. better things time, like waste Reddit! Sweden’s high death toll read mostly due lighter lockdown much due fact switched palliative care nursing home victims sooner have. 

But kinds shutdowns required keep totally nursing homes entirely might cause worse suffering otherwise. median life expectancy 5 months admittance, nursing home patients would almost certainly prefer higher standard care ability say goodbye loved ones final limited time lower standard care, dying isolation, lower risk getting C-19, even smaller risk dying it.  I'm bazillion percent...it's heartbreaking bc happen way. Gender always brought mask debate. Notice even though men statistically likely wear mask public, pretty much time someone mentions anti-maskers refer Karens shitting things up. unemployment. doubt they're running 0 percent profit. billions dollars, defending them? could close allow employees keep health care. happens large chunk population conditioned trust bullshit ""news"" sources. longer reached. think agreement people selfish, still acknowledge ""tough shit"" effective response goal minimize societal harm. think anyone disagrees you; they're interested discussing realistic solution.  lol toxic masculinity fight toxic masculinity I'm sure America Nazi style death camps harvest organs religious minority.

Not mine, found YouTube comment trump video Hillary given like 76% winning 538. still means Trump 1 4 chance winning. think generous. think like 10 % hit it. 

Probabilities different polls. polls pretty spot besides Michigan, Ohio couple places. Hillary’s state loses supposed win within margin error could causing case numbers stabilize? re-closing bars along voluntary distancing? Increased mask usage? 

I'm hoping hard starts come control see future daughter gets see grandmother asks every day. really want real. I'm struggling see lessening spread coming from, though. Sorry tone reply, asshole trying throw ""gotchas"". need stop accusatory troll-like responses. easy fall trap days. realize point even specifically pandemic generally spending priorities, reply misdirected author article.  Florida Texas: ""Just give us couple weeks"" study based something happened today? know comment linked isn’t doctor researcher ? also talk fact American taxpayer raped doctor's office hospital whereas everyone else goes ""Ladida, stupid Americans pay much drugs!"". research occurs, who's paying subsidized drugs others enjoy.

Just I'd like see someone grateful benefit they've enjoyed expense entire lineage.

Oh...um...I literal. literally book stuff. here. always keep hurricane stash. long one sensibly, small amounts time, opposed cleaning store shelves, stockpile unselfish thing. means needing scarce relief supplies later on, means able share neighbors.

BTW, already, stockpile glowsticks. White yellow brightest. They're much safer candles. feel bad kids can't activities year maybe next. sports. daughter found week marching band cancelled state speech. rough day. 

Feel bad young people lose activities they'll never experience again. They've robbed. Yes!!!  nailed it.

Here's something else look r/boneappletea haha American, it’s like 4 3 also live LA. wonder at.

Here's I've seen:

\- Everyone grocery stores wear masks, rare see anyone who's wearing one times spot I'm like 'WTF that?!""- Malibu beach work (and wearing N100 mask) 60-70 people saw within 3 hour period, everyone except 1 couple masks.

Basically everyone see wearing masks they're public. fair, see people wearing masks they're taking walk SO, nature around neighborhoods.

The exception misfortune Hollywood Blvd (work again) saw 60-70% wearing masks. worst mask-wearing percentage I've seen.

I see posts characterizing LA California 'over lockdown' wearing masks that's frankly bullshit. live complete contradiction see eyes daily. O.C. might different story. Build battleships!!! Bring back Iowa Class! Nah mask would prevent followers able gargle balls sums us Americans right. beautiful. ❤️ NY  ugly road, sure. set remindme bot tell 4 months later check post. alarmed surprised fast things went downhill United States, even everyone hopeful early on. truly sad world live now. What?
They opening...department transportation allowed stores set outside dining using parking spaces. lot restaurants/semi-bars taking offer Depends crowded city is. im walking outside crowded anything generally wear mask pretty come close contact others really. shops crowded areas outside yh I'll wear mask doubt wearing mask someone lied? That’s pretty sound logic. Not. Hopefully grandchildren catch take home him. average IQ Missouri go weeks. ten? know live China now? county 6 deaths total almost 200k population. 

My county 800 cases past month.

Would like guess many deaths past month? ZERO!

I know doctor area. 2 months ago (near peak) 3 major hospitals 20 total Covid patients.

A days ago, company owns 2 3 hospitals released current number Covid hospitalizations 2 hospitals. 

Would like guess number patients?

Also Zero.

It real virus. rapidly going away. testing increases causing artificial increase cases.

Everything currently political hoax get rid current president.

Please wake up! slave! says all, even Trump needs put ego side tell truth, shit got real! appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* can't wait 300,000 days many infected dying?  Fight club end scene?  Yeah, narcissistic people may care families strangers,. may still care less family normal people stranger.

They also tend much clue reality mind already know best. COVID ain't got nothing them, danger. imagined advisors taped chair explained it, think he'd actually ask anything since never hears wants  No, let explain again.

They created propaganda piece using leading questions get survey respondents give responses wanted. easy do, anyone it, results mean nothing.

As result, survey means nothing, headline true. I'm guy. seen would punched kidney hard he'd piss blood rest miserable life. main question have: would want US's research? can't even decide think *is* virus, China thinks we're going cure it? Found absolute gem comments video: 


“Look, dragons — uncle great Maester scholar, Grandmaester Steffon Baratheon Citadel; strong seed, strong seed, OK, smart, full chains iron gold, good, smart — know, you’re full-blooded Baratheon, Targaryen, if, like, OK, took throne legitimate Targaryen, would say I’m one smartest people anywhere world — it’s true! — you’re Baratheon try — oh, number — that’s always start off: Went Aerie, good student, went there, went there, this, Gods strong — know give like credentials time, we’re little disadvantaged — look dragons Dothraki screamers, thing really bothers — would easy, it’s important lives — Dragons powerful; uncle explained many, many years ago, power 35 years ago; would explain power what’s going happen right, would thought? — look what’s going whore's two dragons — used three, it’s two — three even now, would said it’s messenger; fellas, fellas because, know, don’t, haven’t figured women smarter right men, so, know, it’s gonna take another 150 years — Lannisters great negotiators, Lannisters great negotiators, so, they, killed, killed us. open field, Ned.”   Turning back Europe 1349. many sure provided quote severely undermines thesis headline could be... wonder pro military people US realized war written history books changed drastically countries afford longer fight using tanks missiles anymore. mean we're traumatized 2016 predicted win one either folks want rule again. realistically, he's constantly shooting foot past months. Honestly, election Trump president, president option would good chance really hard see turning around high case numbers. Even substantial lockdown would probably bring back 20k per day 6-8 weeks, starts again. one things possible collective benefited individual suffered. difficult say made correct decision, intention behind it. need explain Dr. reality absolutely alarming . form $100,000 medical bill? federal coronavirus response dumpster fire.

Tens thousands lives could saved told us February mask up. even March...possibly April.

But I'll take tiny grain good news. Better late never. That's $73 Billion...about 7x NASA's budget Deaths pretty well trajectory cases lag apart 30 days. take best case death rate US (Before rise started) 70000 cases translate 1750 deaths day.

That's best case scenario. However know detection rates getting poorer testing gets overwhelmed. pretty hard assume bad rate getting. assume gets bad first peak could see 5000 deaths day. worst case scenario, assuming 70000 top new case curve (it probably isn't).   guys wait six months see doctor cold year get cast broken arm! /s Masks don’t work Universal mask usage commonsense preempt need almost stay-at-home order. importantly, fully re-open economy enraging!

The fun part get choose want enraged. 

You republican enraged anything everything democrats do, whether makes sense, make believe, something morning.

Or democrat enraged republicans hypocrites enraged everything want bow corporate interest seemingly benefit people.

Thats it. choices. Please dont enraged dont vote though. Thiccc probably get medicine. Qaly real. I'll give example. 80 year old hospital needs heart transplant, get one? answer obviously no. limited resource, reduced number years person use heart, coupled likelihood mortality, combined incidence problems (stroke example) answer resounding no. Responsible ones. us mask shame one else will. People LIKE you!...

Fixed ya. 


But context without mask order place real social change happening communities slight downturn numbers purely anecdotal broader numbers testing catch up... 


there's HUGE backlog test reports people ignoring it. would love see graph death numbers date death date reporting. Wonder relationship bit wack given Fauci Birx's mentor. Man ASSAULTS woman say. good news cases stabilized.

the bad news schools start 4 weeks. anyone glasses know ways stop digging wearing mask? I’m wearing mask desk job fogging huge hassle. usually take glasses.  going see increase mask wearing POTUS said so?  Remember, whenever something happens like, hoax! bunch crisis actors darn liberal media. 

Honestly, people stupid? SARS didn’t fade away. contained aggressive international effort. Oh, there's big surprise! That's incredib... think I'm gonna heart attack die surprise! least dodged bullet. Probably told economic impact. Also wants rate higher limelight. Maybe, depends testing delay is. Arizona example 3-5 week backlog. may even seeing July 4 infections yet. don’t understand.. old tell you, even spit ground grandma would box ears even landed. spitting PEOPLE become something anyone would even consider doing?? Tell me, control Saudi Arabia Russia? first time happened, largest impact, Presidents stop oil wars happening? almost Saudi Arabia Russia give 2 shits say wow.

People saying going pandemic last 100yrs every president time would blunder it. roll dice enough times eventually hit snake eyes. 

He really cut pandemic response teams place quite way lead believe. people moved different teams jobs direct access materials staff needed, simultaneously cutting waste removing teams redundant. people moved different teams time advised administration could best serve intended duties. network execs brave enough create Covid daily briefings likes Dr. Fauci, broadcast time WH ones? relevant 70 years family running joke mypillow guy moms boyfriend (honestly idk started) found trump cannot explain disappointed family was. He's already blaming Fauci; something tune ""Fauci said wear masks"" Lol dEePsTaTe Oxford furthest claims track September release. likely general public medical personnel, high risk individuals, certain essential workers. least one vaccine candidate hopes release October groups. Best case scenario rest us would November EARLIEST much likely sometime Jan-April 2021 developed countries. knows long distribution take rest world. Hrm, lot friends vacationing, going household something like rent beach house rent cabin go camping, driving get there, mostly sticking eating outdoor restaurants wearing masks stuff like that. Yeah understand get pretty complacent cooped up, good mental hygiene. used addict many years ago sorts things demons started resurfacing. 
Not I'll ever go back it, still there. Everyday fight. get tougher though, enduring things like give thicker skin mentally.  really understand conspiracy. Like none people carry cell phone use credit cards drive car? burner phones stolen cars cash-only economy? Cause not, guess what: people already monitor movements. TF would Bill Gates want know Aunt Lois Bumfuck Iowa anyway? What's endgame? Lol lockdowns?! 2 weeks eat indoors get haircut April, that's state. DJ Trump ever notice care direct refutal assertion given enough time, corona virus disappear... would imagine wants get re-elected memory Indiana indicator fairly rural republican, know, republicans reason hate masks. problem people including &amp; especially chronically ill avoiding doctors offices hospitals whenever possible. document cases people visiting physicians? sure figurative? Well Home depot smells better anyway I'm 35 everything sucks. Yeah 37% rewritten 3+7=10 equal 190%: 1+9+0=10. makes sense, percentages hard, took sophomore year US schooling system figure out. 1. read it?

2. understand they're trying say? wish Yelp would close permanently. horrible horrible business practices. You’re right, survey done CivicScience showed this, pew, references both. That’s misspoke. 

Your article doesn’t, opinion, back it’s claim they’re wealthy. says outbreaks happened upper income clusters assumes anti-vaxxers necessarily clusters. don’t see anything supports I’m open correction wrong. can't look opinions single vaccine, look actually vaccinating population.

I agree haven’t even seen anything shows anti-vaxxers indeed less likely get vaccines first place. C’mon know why. narrative sub quite clear.  Wow, really busy work today get keep counts today.

Some crazy numbers put up! Georgia pretty big surprise, Texas well. US past 1100 fatalities again, likely cross 1200 fatalities day first time May 29th, Texas almost certainly going cross 200 fatalities per day mark first time well. utterly embarrassing catastrophic failure. get $11/week state lose $200/week. allowing employees confront customers avoid confrontation.

They need hire security worry, wary. far easy lower guard loosen restrictions, get hit bad outbreak. Corona marathon, sprint - getting zero guarantee one stays zero. yea makes sound ""less horrific"" actually is, pathing problem instead fixing :/ Yeah Marshall’s wife! omg adorable. seriously, thanks posting this. mind mindbogglingly stupid can't wait show colleagues.

again, thanks laugh. 

i particularly love part dna supposed get like charged rf energy create holes it. random dna pops existance fill holes. holes cell DNA makes sense like 2 dimensions. like 4 dimensional stupid. like stupid stupid inside stupid wrapped stupid. world want live don’t need think it. wear masks day. PROVE non believers, don’t send back anecdotal evidence. ""aren't hot"" real nice way say worst response developed nation world. Irrelevant statement. isn’t going kill us all, isn’t going away. 🖖😷 work guy owns corona testing lab saying can’t keep all. trying open CA demand outrageously high. still clue longterm problems Lowe's kicks people out. Big Hawaiian Maui looking motherfucker lifts handlebar mustachio's maga heads like dirty laundry Carry's store like newborns. I'm surprised there's gunfire. fucker much meat could bullet proof, dunno. Well, true, still pretty meant flu deaths usually exacerbation conditions, whereas covid deaths actually caused sars-cov-2 itself. virus actually attacks cells. People conditions may less able fight covid, problem still mainly virus itself.

That's still debatable point, depending define ""causes"", want contradict you. Oops.  ""logistic growth multiple growth regimes"" model I've developed past several months holed property continues providing uncannily accurate short-term projections. posted Sunday blog (not linked lest commit unpardonable sin ""self-promotion"" something receive absolutely compensation) July 18 data New York Times, projected would 3,911,793 reported cases today's update (July 21 data). actual number 3,910,398.

The model accounts weekly variation reported cases due weekend backlogs. course, periodic component reported case numbers nothing number *actual* cases. I'm trying model reported cases, actual ones, according study reported NY Times recently somewhere 2x 12x common reported ones, depending where. comment reply blows away. 

Why teach simplifying polynomials exponentials?  simply can't. Perhaps prefers problems simpler terms (mathematical pun intended) getting lead long-term health damage.

I tend think people thought, good thing. Means IFR might lower think.

I reserve right change mind discover something like every male who's gotten permanently infertile, though. guess Americans even know closed Chinese consulate Houston, ridiculous speak language themselves

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

David R. Stilwell, State Department's assistant secretary state Asia-Pacific affairs, said interview Chinese consulate Houston ""headquarters"" China develop student espionage, economic military intelligence. Echoing Stilwell, Marco Rubio said Houston consulate diplomatic post, ""spy center.

&amp;#x200B;

U.S. State Department spokesman Morgan Ortagus (Morgan Ortagus) earlier morning recognition United States asked Chinese Consulate General Houston close news ""to protect U.S. intellectual property rights private information U.S. citizens"".

&amp;#x200B;

White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said, ""President Trump unhappy state China's handling outbreak, virus outbreak killed 140,000 Americans"". Conway said, ""I think president made clear he's happy China - they've released 'China virus' country world, there's little transparency honesty little information obtained "". added: ""We still information China. still know exactly many cases, many deaths, etc."". understandable, reasons choosing that. need know understand anything choice. 

I thank opinion time took. I'll apologize using post means convey message, slight person. meant anyone see hopefully understand people within nation selfish, hateful, ignorant. people fought life could lost everything process.

Edit: Spelling/grammer Allowing assholes continue assholes consequences going get people killed. need hire security. chickenshit kevins actually stand someone see authority. bully employees they're allowed to.  Without litigating mask-wearing issue, it’s hard take Mulvaney’s point seriously given months Trump refused wear mask. also overlooks still learning virus infects people. recommendations public health officials began issue February based far less known — consider early public health recommendations based virus infecting people surfaces, via airborne transmission.

Why ask Fauci told Americans wear masks instead speculating? Oh, wait, Fauci actually admited lied, knowing effective, worried lack masks health ""I regret anything said context time said it, correct. told task force meetings serious problem lack PPEs,"" said. much following science. everytime Fauci opens mouth, people wonder political reason says, really scientific truth. sure you’re downvoted. true means CFR actually 1/10 say is. hidden clues sides buildings like he's batman villain?

&amp;#x200B;

/s we’re going allow complete breakdown logic inability hold consistent point view due bias stand, huh? 

Nah. me. Damn didn’t take long. Maybe 1300 talking deaths/hospitalizations ratio declining. provide chart, give minutes

Edit: shows percent hospitalized covid patients dying given day. Back march/April, 3% patients dying day. Now, 1.5% patients dying day. I’m wondering COVID something else. I’ve never heard “transient” symptoms long. Yes, population size matters. California bigger European countries, comparing states via raw numbers giving good comparison. Hiding anti-science opinion like anti-mask behind image demand civility projects really disingenuous. Free tertiary education plus well many Germans take pride good reputation engineering &amp; science. 

Other countries national identity closely tied education science anything really. Yay us.  We've stabilized deaths 4 times amount 3 weeks ago. It’s disease highly contagious specific scenarios. studied extensively know transmits, know transmits extremely poorly outdoors. outdoors, it’s reduced capacity aid distancing.  They’re “ignoring precautions,” they’re taking exact precautions public health officials recommended. 

I think football game 50k people probably overdoing it, there’s definitely ways make pretty safe using science told us disease. feel like ""lie"" bit disingenuous.

Highlighting lack evidence effect different highlighting evidence lack effect.

Furthermore, numbers first started escalating concern half measures would worsen outcomes due emboldening bad habits. lockdown logically would work infectious illness coming water/food supply, mask helps certain infections varying degrees efficacy.

Not mention initial PPE shortages.

Sledgehammer approach first flatten curve, collect PPE data, scale testing tracing, use evidence guide nuanced approach... half ass lockdown end early economy nothing situation escalates. I'll point scientist peer review great authenticity work, really want body papers supporting particular conclusion feel confident. Good step direction. care ""think"". Facts science there. Figure yourself. PCR tests unreliable never meant mass testing. Source: nobel laureate winning scientist invented fuckin test lol Welp quit got covid I’d screwed either way thought chronic fatigue syndrome, turns I’m lazy. Hard Nobody actually measures number, guesstimate. Further, developed country flu vaccine available catching dying flu much less likely decide proactive. many people know died flu last year?

And numbers accurate US serious flu problem people claim US 65000 flu deaths year one tenth number US one tenth world population stand corrected! Absolutely, unfortunately I’m piece shit. gym 2-3hrs night pre-covid. I’m lucky force lazy ass 30 minute workouts week.

And I’m 150 fucking percent aware I’m privileged, financially secure, whiny, selfish shitbag can’t stop feeling shitty **hundreds thousands people fucking dying**. suck I’m fucking blind.  I'll take source then. 

As new question, one assuming point closure business must reduced infections within two weeks (or done effective). why?

In case, given often delays testing results, reported cases today could several days before. confirm. approaching 120 days since onset symptoms, positive antibody test May (it false positive, exposure infected individuals I’m essential worker experienced classic Covid symptoms) still experiencing brutal cough gets worse humidity, exhaustion overdo it, today started feel muscle weakness back then. *brutal*. I’m scared permanent damage I’ll never feel healthy again. already autoimmune issues it’s done number psyche think long term implications here. truly get bad humid weather it’s going forever, strongly consider moving much drier climate.  Dammit... mean hey dont deserve guy made original comment deseves gold Yes! case, experienced small accident work knew related trauma. 

Just curious, long take feel better? didn’t even break it, it’s year still gets pain. unbearable happened, course, lingered. crazy. many started smoking? work ICU don’t worry people employer protecting me. see people comment work office nobody wears mask employer doesn’t enforce it, makes fucking blood boil. excuse employer protect employees. It’s criminal book. I'll note age group 65+. UK also better U.S metric -- slightly. 

For age groups, know, number seem tracked official data anywhere. lockdown months?! state 2 weeks half assed restrictions April. that's it. Please keep updated. friends already sharing Facebook. like completely dodged question! I'll give three guesses. wish could.
now virus testable anymore. Sore throat lasts hours.
testing per appointment usually next day.
If test right smack bang hours negative (had 2x already)
so prety useless.
(antibody tests taken country deemed unreliable ask seems heaps fraudulent tests)

aaand.. test positive?
they still can't treat waste money system can't say yes it. Send quarantine including family (whilst also back March recovered)
so imprisonment help really.
I work home hardly leave home venture days cough or, symptoms. keep social distance plus mask..
what else want free person strange perservering symptoms? really could care less face pandemic erodes trust also listening who/cdc decided tell public truth believe finally stock piled enough.


So argument isn’t government isn’t willing sacrifice life piece cloth, it’s aren’t right anymore. 

Ohh still listening got caught lying time time time time time again. 

Soooo much better. hope so! Feds can’t that. lack authority. know deaths gone up. comment responding mentioned lung heart damage COVID cases *didn't* result death. I'm saying seeing go roof they're common among COVID victims, especially fairly severe cases. poseurs. quit back February COOL Replace household gym know someone would exactly that.  People like single US understand nobody several European countries UK wearing masks. girlfriends family UK refuse wear one, London acting like it’s totally back normal.

I think places outside states huge spikes coming soon Thats liberal fake laws true americans support god emperor trump

Dont ya know naysayers swayed facts analysis mess we're in. still, good have. sue hospitals price gouging well. point policy willing enforce it. instigating confrontations within store. Ask pharmacist picking meds, know ton. call ask. Gotta love everyone takes msm word. wish people would instill critical thinking, instead mindless robots spewing CNN nonsense always thought US would hit 100k per day first. Brazil India seem likely now. Easy. New York terrible testing beginning since hit early California probably extensive testing US today. NY testing March/April level California today likely would finding like 50k cases per day. Word! They're talking radioisotope ligated monoclonal antibodies. They're shooting radiation.

The antibody binds target antigen radioisotope damages surprisingly accurate way. NASA can't make space suit, last saw American Mars FREE!!11 Pretty sure absolutely nobody else even PCR tests mass scale like US understand PCR tests meant used mass testing. Sigh. There's nothing special making tests unreliable, unreliable period. believe people like charged attempted murder said, im grateful have, dont take ask Im blessed have, people world facing allot damaging times right go, floods, damages things had, plagues destroy crops leaving many starving, plagues even killing thousands right leaving children without parents. see things around globe watch much suffering, day day basis. dont even realize tell words. idea good bless wealth have. others dream have. im talking materialistic bullshit.

so sound empathetic actually realize look around complaining, even realize lucky bless are. sound hateful dont care cause people speak truly see others go through, lost, said above. need get form reality check fast instead complaining inconvenience. like education, masks,online shopping, sports.

want try again. feel free. remember grateful realize blessed are. useful, though. “obvious” long time heavy objects fall faster light objects. somebody actually tested it. it? shitting Dope 'Rosie Riveter' made warplanes red bandannas. makes face masks cloth

She must good making war plans. think they'd structurally sounds made bandana material. Agreed, however quite bad thought. told isolate pending results, takes two weeks get results, eligible file unemployment/pua claim two weeks. I'm peace getting either, date science HIV transmitted used work safe sex educator. tell roommates 
 
FAIL. Come people, nobody's mandating tell whole world, people living deserve know test came back positive. factually based reply. Someone asked many, replied, using statistics, many. 

There's nothing controversial it. Maths, logic viruses care feelings.

""Oh no, terrorists hijacking planes!!! wonder many terrorist attacks happen re-open airports 9/11""

""Not many"".

""You monster!!!!"". Welcome America!! That’s one big household... 16 people?! knows many others 16 went infect.. Uh looks like ""cool-duh-sac"" sac pronounced like first sound eye. That's asked. person responding merely said pandemic exposed flaws modern (especially American) capitalism

But specify American capitalism either. said modern capitalism. true modern capitalism give us vaccine, modern capitalism also part reason country's response pandemic first place fucked up.

No. would poor government. also sort bagged together German, British, American capitalism one category, think that's helpful, they're three different systems

As first person. responded claims capitalism capitalism, gave examples capitalist countries. It’s unfortunate, really. UK seems down. fulfill online orders warehouse locations, stores open public. least larger chains do. 
The 80% living paycheck paycheck kind misleading though. know plenty people make great money make sure bills paid blow rest fancy toys vacations. includes people living way outside means reckless cash. article:

It’s merely earning low wages struggling. CareerBuilder reports nearly 10 percent Americans salaries $100,000 live paycheck paycheck well. Trump: best peaks, highest beautiful peaks ever seen Thanks info, I'll pass along.  get temperature checked work handheld laser things reliable things world entirely possible low grade fever week. temp normally 97ish itd pretty easy couple degrees hotter week pay attention it. tested Monday 9 days ago heard nothing. It’s completely useless right GA. provide source? American here. quit too. seems really stupid smoking respiratory pandemic (and economic crisis). Smoked ten years. something called COVID brain? Maybe virus hijacked reasoning centers forced social control it. Maybe asshole. mean others fears

Their fears legit bullshit. need coddle unrealistic phobias propagated fake news. really can't breath mask on, COVID actually afraid of. generally good practice destroy samples particularly cultivated strains something, case ever need go back it, use branching point science. reasons might ever want go back smallpox vials, doubt they'll ever actually materialize. 

With said imagine stored CDC purpose, USA Russia demanded one well. 

[Did quick google search CDC nice summary page history America’s response was/is certainly among worst that’s say countries could’ve handled better right, world. see year half dozen go stupid, sick anyways...in Italy sick get paid sick leave...here Covid considered like accident work, still paid state, different public authority get sick leave COVID scare (turns virus) SICK. Muscle aches pains, splitting headache, appetite, etc.).
I let people came contact FREAKED told get test ASAP. 

That's works, can't drive testing facility get test. wait day get appointment amount text messages received time astounding. need 5 messages person telling get test faster. ChucklesSovietly.jpg said did? Learned lot video, thank much putting together! dick I've proudly voted Bernie twice. Bernie's platform normal Canada alot Europe. Hell, Europeans even worker protections. work ultra conservatives 3%ers get along fine, even though political views based fear.  enforced? issue order enforced announcement means nothing cause death directly linked via symptoms suffered, indirectly linked due say person able see doctor fast enough they're tending mass covid-19 cases medical supplies available, certainly.

In survive case covid-19 caused clotting blood cuts blood flow. Many patients lost limbs due flow cut extremities, victims endured damage essential organs. Trump smart! invented mask! world leader Asian countries follow us. people die charged murder. Heard anyone?

🤔

Not criticising statement BTW. Stop cherry picking. said retail sales, [overall retail sales year retail segments **people allowed shop**. **want** to.

Ok, nothing lying year year sales way tell, compare companies allowed remain open (like big-box retailers, home improvement stores) niche things like cosmetics games. Allowed remain open? Up. Forced close? Down.

Ok, point trying make? never said drop year year sales due shutting logic there, hoss.

Seriously, point think making lying, changing subject entirely instead actually defending lies? &lt;pushing old wooden yer whackos! Bring yer whackos!"" anyone know economy rebounded? felony knowingly infect people potentially fatal disease? He's realizing bad cases are, he's realizing bad polls are... No. presence antibodies makes one immune. Rather, body's ability make learned response appropriate pathogen. active infection long time, reason antibodies remain system functioning immune system produce needed. all, would joke? I'm going randomly pick candidate. want make educated decision, wrong that? many folks thought south got mine genetics. Pretty huge dick = phd right? 

Just kidding :). everything America. respond personal attacks. Sureee ""FREE"", like pay taxes ""That's secret, I'm *always* angry"" state would negotiate wholesale rates hotels kind use, subsidize further. least passing cost along everyone, providing subsidies need cannot afford. 

It would expenditure tax dollars would pay many, many times over. Plus, would double lifeline hotels, many struggling hit business taken pandemic. Oh be, encouraging coworkers same. may ability affect travel directly, I’m one known group one listen things travel. tracer advised people likely source infection? That’s it’s supposed go. Seriously... last 70 years, Vietnam able beat France, US, China, track beat Coronavirus.. Gotta give credit due... Yup. Grew SLO county. Bay Area. Completely unsurprised article comments. work retail US south. made manager buy store thermometer gave us instructions take employee temps every shift. laughed. shifts solo, person opens store a.m. alone til 3 4 p.m. next employee come closes alone. Yes, let’s monitor closely, company offers insurance benefits pay time become ill.

Thankfully, escaped plague far, wearing masks, cleaning well, enforcing mask policy customers. two big uncertainties Tengell ignores: potential permanent harm even mild infection, unproven lasting immunity. take months years data collection know sure factor, plow ahead confidence without answers best big gamble, worst insanely reckless. guess good time start smoking think hospital numbers look now, daily case numbers place. Umm, no. Modern capitalism don’t vaccines diseases like RSV first vaccine failed. money it. foreign army killed many people virus had, people would lose shit.

It’s much worse it’s government - yet consequences? can’t wait vote. That’s carrot stick point. murder. Can't imagine husband going through. love life dying childbirth. words describe that. ...did he? actually difficult prove whether vaccine efficacious not. issue initially low prevalence UK. 

The timeline could change, makes sense would confidence would enough data approval September. hafta kinda forget last two seasons one based science. IIRC keep around incase another pathogen similar smallpox pops up. Best practice keep samples case. procedures place prevent ever getting out.  That's America you, everyone thinks special.

Everyone thinks better driver average everyone thinks drive safely drunk, guys problem  Ahhh. Thank clarifying. missed part discussing this. Read comment again. nice day r/politics Broadway Nashville (photo article) excuse what? mask? food. Yes, individual facilities seem this.

Why earth go one Covid tracking sites pull current historical virus levels nationwide heat map?

Every community (followed pooled mass PCR testing virus detected area).  reopening phases automatically tied community virus levels. Well lefts defense, Gerryrig cheat much possible. people voted Hillary. know. Maybe people mildly less stupid shit taking somewhat better care lockdown? injection 

You triggered drug addicts. Imagine many kids going lose lives open schools mass shooting takes place. 1 dead kid already 1 many. Online teaching mandatory ever since Columbine. catch reckless endangerment charges WNY Finger Lakes region saw increase line right phase 3 reopening process becoming legitimate vaccine research proving safe.   owner store one saying ok wear mask. 

So even get groceries delivered store, would groceries exposed mask wearers.  keep saying kids less likely get (which total nonsense whatever)

I heard people saying that... kids usually mildly affected it.  rate lags behind infections around 10-20 days, start rising soon. case fatality rate \*should\* bit lower , like mentioned, getting better treating it. Unfortunately, rate daily infections currently double last peak, means even fatality rate half last peak, that's still going mean amount deaths (140,000+) brings death total least 300,000. took 3 months leader admit; 1) virus real, ploy make look bad 2) Masks good idea 3) ""gonna go away like magic""  pointing truth personal attack

fact think probably stems reason unable admit Sweden fucked despite fact 5k dead DoNt UsE wOrD consider patriot confidence America time low. Trump brought worst country fear he's gone, legacy remain. 

He's emboldened worst among us. could also read article learn kids roommate, mention husband. mean, he's still alive, least, HCQ necessarily responsible that. info treatments might undergoing, symptoms he's showing, beyond ""still positive""? I'm fucking mad school thing. fucking people taking much children. tried curbside start this.

I set order two weeks out. redirected order store 20 miles away without alerting me, go 30 minutes way instead store right next apartment. Fortunately, *also* running behind miss pickup window. got half stuff, half got wrong (smaller sizes, similar different product, etc). also include medication, OTC important (PPI's, miss dose acid reflux comes back twice bad), upgraded items bought expensive versions easier grab (prepackaged instead loose, expensive *and* spoiled faster). one yogurts leaked.

So... no, again. I'll gladly wear two masks face shield, use self checkout, socially distance, that. even ask, officially recommended, back CDC saying wear mask. I'll even shop odd hours fewer people there. trust grocery store get order right best times, right best times. even top 20 median wealth per adult. Mississippi even worse. Mean wrong way analyze there's massive inequality. NY, client mine lost parents within 2 DAYS covid. funeral 2 caskets. Totally devastating stuff. I'm really close her, listening story brought tears eyes. I'm sure old were, early 50s. got people brushing situations like saying ""just stay home scared"", everyone privileged even option.  already learned live without it. Gotta adapt. I’m sure really rely data primitive places... understand, virus catch virus? happens world, many people think fucking flu... We're even close, even possible all.

I think people realize herd immunity without vaccination would absolute disaster millions would die. feasible option. Im Maine. Vactionland. Id like point 2 things. started list state license plates. numbers, state from. I've almost completed chart due influx tourists. 

Im Portland grew small town midcoast maine population fluctuations season. went back visit mom last Sunday went get food beach eat. refused get car saw parking lot beach full. small, little known beach full towner summer folk. 

It's small Republican hot spot. fucking last Maine governor bartender local bar. saw masks worn packed areas. poldering since immaterium... Watch video - says feels appropriate people pull masks isle mostly empty like stay 6 feet away someone wearing mask.

Yeah, good idea, viable option many.

Beyond parents young children needing find child care even riskier school work, there's also issues like one sparsely populated rural community, half households area internet access available there's terrestrial wireless service existing satellite providers beyond capacity already area months long waiting lists get service, they'll even entertain signups.

In March, New Yorkers still packed subways elevators like sardines, without masks officials telling us specifically wear masks.

Inertia hard thing overcome.

This biggest public health blunder modern times, thousand lost lives result. Reckless endangerment? He’s already started path. yesterday’s briefing said always carried one pocket wore  Unless refugee that's works like, everyone Actually, last week sank 69k tests, % infected week 81k tests, theory running people feeling need tested.

Maybe draw straws whose poor nose stick thingy get numbers reason.  That's fancy way saying we're poor. good news. Great news would've administration endorsing masks beginning. could've already possibly past this. make ***volume***. 

in words.. go 2 3 something like that.

MLB using spit testing. every 48 hours.. plus symptoms (temp) 2x daily.

&amp;#x200B;

if test kids like that.. miss ""one day time""

&amp;#x200B;

one pos? 

stay home day.. 

high temp - go home.

pos again? 

stay home get swab test

&amp;#x200B;

MLB guys can't even park temp.

&amp;#x200B;

this sounds like *ideal solution* schools think process broken three phases - prescreening, arrival screening, regular monitoring - **with diagnostic testing done saliva.**

The ""covered individuals"" submit questionnaire regarding symptoms exposure days prior arrival. **Shortly thereafter, subject temperature check saliva nose-swab test diagnosis well blood test antibodies.**

After that, individuals temperatures **and symptoms tested least twice daily.** uniformed employees, plus trainers physical therapists, undergo saliva tests every day.

The frequency tests change depending need.

**If someone found temperature 100.4 degrees, allowed enter ballpark required self-isolate.** teams identify people close contact employees either show symptoms test positive.

**Anyone tests positive must remain daily communication team remote location, permitted travel around covered individuals. test negative twice least 24 hours apart, exhibit fever 72 hours, take antibody test order return.** That's proven all. jury still COVID immunity. Anyone saying know sure talking ass. 

Their data showing antibodies could begin fade months in, mean subject antibody immunity left all. tcell immunity looking like could important COVID. 

Not mention SARS survivors still immune response 17 years later, that's similar virus COVID know of.

I doubt guy actually took Hydro, claims did. known along. think state governments providing people place quarantine, staff informed risks, issued necessary PPE, consented working there, receiving hazard pay.

7 day rolling average deaths steadily rising also can't measure directly Memorial Day weekend. handful people getting sick crowded beach party going deaths stack up, come secondary, tertiary, beyond infections, need community spread.

Think like this:

- 10 people beach party 2,000 people infected, might infect 300 people. 300 people get sick next 1-2 weeks. **(1-2 weeks initial infection event)**
- 300 people go lives transmitting virus next 1-2 weeks. might transmit 6,000 people get sick next 1-2 weeks. **(2-4 weeks initial infection event)**
- 6,000 people go lives transmitting virus next 1-2 weeks. might transmit 120,000 people get sick next 1-2 weeks, large enough increase people start noticing. **(4-6 weeks initial infection event)**

After 4-6 weeks, FINALLY start noticing death count moving large enough infected population people actually notice. math Memorial Day weekend, puts us at...about mid-July, right see mortality rate start go again.

So yes, increase likely Memorial Day infection events. Mortality increases July 4th infection events likely start showing mid-August...right we're getting ready open school year.

The solution quarantine. That's got levels before, way get now. issue become politicized though, likely option. fall going tragedy. Go Nationwide mask requirements public. hard breathe mask get oxygen tank there's mask trouble with.
It's start. test kids like that.. miss ""one day time""

If 30% tests false positive, they'd miss 30% school days. Bay Area homeless... bought weed booze stop leaving infecting everyone.    Varies state.

So basically every comment every major subreddit? lol I’m sorry hope things get better you. 

I’m position help anyone promise I’ll vote Republicans every election remainder life helps Geanine Eisel, insisting everyone wears mask right thing do. nice, insist safety. 

Mask wearing prevents covid spreading lessen exposure encounter infected person. Lower initial exposure correlates milder case virus. 

There actual medical reasons wearing mask. might consider asking person use pick cannot wear mask. needs say that. spent whole time declaring guided science, economics, wouldn’t open till safe. residents dying record numbers. watch video owner causing issue allowing customers pull masks putting onus others stay far away see someone wearing mask. personal attack responding call such. made mistake. Thought suggesting cov-19 virus would evolve less virulent. sounds like dream! Jeeze, turn around sucks. tested recently got cleared 36 hours later, thankfully. took day send lab hours process. Small kids, (in)famous flu vectors, usually wear masks. It’s super common religious families. mom 12 kids, parents mormon. 

That said, don’t faith Mormon church think it’s made up, don’t think parents crazy anything believing it. mom wonderful woman treated everyone kindness, nothing great person. lot big families don’t shitty parents well. Smallpox effectively eradicated. There's like handful vials labs otherwise gone IIRC.

And Europe, China, Vietnam etc reopening schools comparable kind thing happen often countries competently controlled spread. end sight, lot people lost years hard work, many lost everything financially, houses careers they're basically saying fuck point

..not saying right wrong what's happened bet strong whiskey would also kill pretty effectively.  ""We're New York"" - CA Governor Newsom, April 2, 2020 California need take measures NY stop spread COVID-19. Yes. still never eradicated. point. Yeah safety important though, know parents don’t feel comfortable sending kids school middle pandemic even that. small town facebook group. whole thing is, think mask protects wear one wear one. understand mask helps spreading it. flinging mud heroic either, granted entertaining. 2 weeks, deaths spiked. acknowledge wrong? bet something inject election. safe effective? likely. rushed market without long term testing scrutiny vaccines typically subjected to. massive scale clinical trial. said employer doesn’t let take work test negative, illegal. still take work get paid feel COVID symptoms. must considered full time salaried apply. take sick employer didn’t pay, show HR department ask reimbursement.

Incivility? even read comment? OP people wearing masks post explains why. Yet, somehow post removed “incivility”. That’s rich. Source? Idk man. There’s “pride” you’re stealing family feed addiction. It’s literally mental illness. lose pride gutter point self loathing don’t think even deserve happy keep stealing lying. muh conservatives. muh conservatives.  think like: 

""Hey Canada, remember we're together.....until we're serious trouble, fuck you!""  6 10 days results now, used 2 4. refugees doner amounts cash people DIED US INFECTED China! It’s American virus now. way cost living nowadays US it’s required you’re getting paid well. Well wrong definitely tests 100% accurate, one them. I'm talking specificity vs sensitivity. test specific towards SARS antigen rate 100%. sensitive rate 87.5%. Meaning statistically never confuse actual antigen another antigen(specificity). antigen present, 87.5% time detect it(sensitivity). Thus false negatives, also goes prove point assay 100% accurate. Good know! It’s something I’d even looked into, covid positive subreddit even first saw related vitamin k. give damn coronalympics.
The fact flu season 2019-2020 covid epidemic Sweden combined killed people normal flu season. plague wiped minimum 1/3 Europe changed entire socio-political landscape continent, plague? actual president (not someone plays one TV) able implement national strategy contain combat virus.

It’s actually good pandemic less need go outside stable group. like philippines conflating ""America region"" ""America, people."" America region richest country world -- majority American people living paycheck-to-paycheck worse, words *poor*. high GDP per capita meaningless poverty 30-odd countries. mainly Rio Grand Valley struggling now, mostly shithole even best times simply many excuses AZ trust reporting, especially backlog consistently running thousands tests processed.  Wait, comment political? missing something?! Four months... damn. RIP. lag appears pretty long many cases younger people. concerns part low fatality rate younger folks may fight much longer, much less fatal time, case fatality rate younger people might creep time.

What need stats hospitalization lengths people age. Looking age breakdown hospitalizations states whose outbreaks controlled might provide insight.

EDIT: Looking data least, appears total number hospitalizations still low people 30, concern outlined appear valid. difference - first major pandemic digital record dipshit it, like individual level. easy access. Back immediate aftermath Spanish Flu (I guess could dig old newspapers find anti-mask league something, still feasible people). Hopefully time anti-science morons held account friends family. Hopefully phrase ""didn't oppose masks?"" pretty powerful way shoot politically scientific topics like climate change such.

I might optimistic this. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* denies it, roommate said continued work. would believe? fine works. people dying illnesses lack medical/surgical operations would least match that. UK we're set see thousands cancer deaths usual this. Keep closed till people choose eating wearing mask. bet start wearing mask. Screw joe Biden. Trump 2020 It’s relevant point white people obsessed race like suggest. There’s way telling whether black person slave descendent child immigrant came 20 years ago. two different people go job interview, interviewer isn’t trying decipher whether slave descendant, hiring based that. It’s absurd assertion kind thing happens. Looooool, social security, education job security. direct comparison made rates moderate severe depression now: rates similar. One would expect country soft NPIs would feature lower rates depression, case one compares Sweden Italy. Yup death rates finally catching exponentially too. knew day would come. making allowance excuses.

This virus incredibly susceptible UV damage destroying seconds. outdoor activities blamed spread. Viral load level also seems important determining patient outcomes well.

It easy tell realize wrong, refuse admit it. keep flailing looking things try argue insult over. None justifies lie everything still locked restricted.

I sorry deny science, personal problem yours, mine. That's true though. number deaths US rising last weeks likely continue hospitals ICUs capacities.  Look man, get it. get government truly fucking people over. woman gotten *sixteen* people infected choice, minimum. many people sixteen contact with?

So yeah, I'm judging her. woman sympathy actually question poverty here, I've lived poverty. I've homeless. I've starved. I'm *still* going knowingly risk infecting god knows many people potentially fatal disease. sympathise her, understand potential motivations, *is* still selfish. risking deaths around her. lack governmental support might putting people like woman untenable situations, everyone's still responsible choices.


And let's forget, even going work. infected everyone lived with. even tell them. question needing go work, absolutely *had* get money, again, I'd sympathise. tell lived with? 2month old baby, tell anyone? even isolate home, even wear mask. *nothing* try least damage control shitty choices. forced stay home Would sharpie wall work? Pretty much.

We've also spent decades measuring antibodies proxy immunity great success. Yet bunch people read single abstract entire life clinging one study citing constantly ""nuh uh"" whenever anyone points possible issues waning immunity.  debate:

Trump: told everyone wear mask. did. really did. told Fauci said need everything possible beat invisible CHYYNA virus...

Biden (interrupting): \*cough\* *Trumpvirus*

Trump: Like saying before... invisible CHYYYNA virus....

Biden (interrupting): \*cough\* *Trumpvirus* I'm Texan see things improving. still see Instagram feed flooded pictures taken crowded beaches masks. think we've hit testing limit. anything, expect increase deaths. tested 5 days ago. Results expected take 10+ days right I'm halfway mark. Makes contact tracing pointless. 

I'm feeling better now. took 5 days work. I've never taken much time sick. Returned work remotely Monday. both. sure downvoted I'm NY exactly happend, go get tested.

At first testing recently travelled Italy China, month later switched severe symptoms, told stay home ride out, 

and finally started testing whoever wanted tested, took months get there.

Almost cases NYC Long Island (Metropolitan NY) area, big area all, 25,000 deaths small area. 

I know I'm live NY called NYS Coronavirus hotline day one get tested way get tested then. 

People outside NY idea went here.  asthma. still wear mask. think people peace mind. wife really sick back late January absolutely fine. would nice know virus not. think could argue 180 that, go even asking Russia also stayed Afghanistan. middle east fucked perpetually via foreign policy could economic paradise, may become religiously progressive decades ago, may essentially terrorism compared now.

Perpetual war profound effects.

You could argue US world police perhaps would empowered countries, created stability prosperity, perhaps even letting socialism set roots unhindered could allowed exploration alternative political economic structures revolutionize entire globe. think everybody point. mom RN front line worried sick mental health..... numbers using shows much money average person has? I'd like see official numbers using. claiming keeping masks kids possible somehow myopic? chance, bad reporting Jesus, that's fucked states different.

I got test last week Delaware. Drive up, took 20 minutes, got results next day (late night though).  free.

They mobile testing centers state every day. _Plaguenami_, SyFy movie nobody wanted everybody lived through. four sentences captured big part American society fucked right now:

- took *two weeks* get test results highly infectious disease.
- automatically get paid sick.
- *were* sick get paid sick right disease.
- We're middle lethal pandemic century US policy causing *healthcare professionals* avoid getting tested fear getting paid.

It's absolute lunacy! Haha, intentional! Throw jail test talking about? pcr test antibody test, requires sample blood? shut state  pathologist one medical subs week ago explaining tested autopsy - previously tested positive, died complication COVID-19 hospital test positive death, covid19 listed death certificate. vent long enough clear initial infection died lung damage anyway, would count towards covid19 death toll. 

It wasn’t clear deaths home tested standards s/he following either government (national state) national certification group. didn’t learn face Masks effective late May early June. 

Yea, that's countries around world recommended wearing march made mandatory close spaces. statements true.

It concretely known 1% US population gotten virus. case 10 times amount people its, 10%, 90% people still susceptible. literally says: think would little easier autumn Norway measures primarily back pocket, take measures already place easy upgrade something hand, therefore would drastic changes country like Norway one intends close schools, close businesses,it big consequences, way **I think hopefully get away easily** get similar scenario Sweden Norway increasing number cases precisely whole approach less dramatic many different ways.

He goes say: case significantly people Sweden immune Norway also matters, course, even think total herd immunity may never achieve that. diseases seldom disappear way. clearly levels big significance large reduction see quickly speaks strongly fairly large immunity population makes spread infection along everything else together actually held back stay level time think makes us probably get away easier, might say better equipped, **I think get away easier** get new &lt; inaudible word fall. 

He's saying Sweden better, takeaway here. Yes spent 7+ hours day child uncomfortable. depends testing

The bay area really good organizations turning results around faster, free CVS testing like myself, results took ~8 days Oh, sorry. anybody actually waiting it? feel sorry people did. took test Ohio last week. took test Friday 4:30pm got results automatically released “my chart” Saturday 4:20am. negative. explode liftoff think hiv coronavirus good comparison likely good long life days evidently dont believe virus dangerous

If purposefully spread disease pandemic reapply citizenship fuck job better. Thanks comment, made day. duno bro.

Let's become together.

Conspiracy yes.
A conspiracy vast n pervasive 99% see place inside it. citation this? 10,000IU vitamin safe daily dose. suggesting people brains actually use them? 16 people house lives four adults, means they're paying hundred dollars week rent. Sounds like poor person's situation me. shitty situation. one, China outsource capabilities countries.  y'all right? discovered looking past cases. mo large block false positives reported anyone seen information semi-private pools? condo complex pool, limiting number people allowed in, wear masks swimming, there's chairs try reduce time spent hanging deck. really interested testing myself. What's crazy old ladies going swimming together. They're supposed maintain 6 feet distance even pool, perfect that.

Thank advance anyone research information. hot lately, understand people would want swim, matter risks might be. quite reached level comfort yet. complaining. making complaint something doesnt work inconvience due pandemic. empathy said food right shelter. count blessings grateful, thousands losing homes dont even get eat. moment. complaining cause cant make work you. pandemic. thats LACK EMPATHY. Still, easier spread ventilate areas summer. everyone crams office buildings limited air circulation closed windows bad news. Maybe brain, something alive inside skull.  Well yeah, that’s relatively straight forward process population 5 million people page actually care one another. I'm quick judge. Fuck sixteen people living household. level poorness can't afford work two weeks. yes  Sure whatever. US always finds excuses said another comment worth repeating here. 

SCT 8% likely irrelevant predictor compared issues Black americans face. things know anecdotally, Black american whose family since slavery, supported medical publications. well thought meaningful response. love countered logic facts rather devolving petty name calling like people often can't think actual arguement. takes lot pieces work. small 4.8 million people, island nation. key factor people trusted leader, divided said plan. Everyone best country hold Constitution scream rights. took seriously, locking down, stopping travel quarantine outsiders. We, America, exact opposite. First leader sounding quote I've seen him. we're almost half year Pandemic. story coronavirus constant string someone watching disaster hitting someone else, getting hit disaster. 

I know there's anyone hit yet, but, so, we're begging believe: coming. Please take cheap mitigations now. Child endangerment much That's interesting shit may want use capitalization punctuation you’re going preach education worthless. 

Also, reliable information online comes highly educated people. doesn’t appear magic, it’s result years study, discussion, experience. swear people U.S. spout ""freedom"" ""choice"" defense act wear masks pandemic ones strangely confuse precautionary measures fear, fear weakness. People like dangerous kind mindset. downwards spiral them. Instead participating unity overcome, fight win lose. ""Go store without mask, choice decision you. Everyone else stay home fear."" ignore going around cling onto status-quo desperately seek restore cost health safety around them.

Attempting explain reality situation we're think way is, instead, deciphered challenge them. them, even much give consideration acknowledge need temporarily adjust instilled minds everyday life admitting weakness thus losing imagined challenge they've invented. Everything fight must weak. agree weak. ponder alternative perspectives weak giving in. flat-line, minimal range knowledge truth accept within parameters everything established within even absolved logic. ""Masks dangerous extent understanding Hypercapnia without research solely based circulating image text spoke inhaling CO2 affects body."" someone could explain masks commonly worn throughout long catastrophe many occupations cultures without issue. Explain Hypercapnia prevalent without pre-existing condition respiratory chronic illness turn, pose threat them. Explain hopes clearer understanding perceived argument dissected alleviate worry, person spoke challenged. win lose fight. fear weakness agree.

The truth is, never cared research claim, actually concern words. cling barrier sounds well-meaninged utilize front stand behind ground freely stake opposition regardless actually means.

It's always turned weird self-appointed victim perspective they're ones danger they're main cause spreading virus danger themselves. Unable comprehend actions main contributing factor worsening state world.

They literally unable understand care people actions. need learn live locking isn’t long term solution. experts assumes would learn NYC.

Europe least Asia. Rest Europe learn Italy. NYC learn Europe. these, would anyone assume rest US learn NYC? They're tipping towards kleptocracy/fascism, country needs eviscerate power November send message. way beyond whether lean conservative liberal election. Republican Party leadership rotten core current form/Trumpism needs destroyed November, US done. That's hyperbole. Hmmm... bought online Canada large, prominent online pharmacy retailer here. Delivery 3 days. identify 68k cases per day, even deaths climb back 2k official mortality rate article alludes would less half March / April.

""Mortality rate"" rate deaths compared overall population. That's going keep increasing people die. Unless want compare mortality rates shorter time slices, even so, number cases identified nothing it.

You're thinking case fatality rate - article about. right that: simply higher number deaths raise case fatality rate, also depends many cases identified. entirely possible deaths rise case fatality rate remains much lower March. 100% specificity unusual laboratory testing... esentially says going mistake square circle, per say. 

Some methodologies precise accurate. almost always study included package inserts assays describe manufacturer's attempt trying prove disprove sensitivities specificities. go along explain try include potentially interferring substances, anything similar might obscure results, wrong swabs, potential contaminants, Etc.. 

I feel comfortable 100% specificity. sentiment isn’t true. safe that’s Oxford vaccine able go Phase 3. Phase 2 makes sure it’s safe Phase 3 measures effectiveness. There’s nothing worry vaccine. Yes would. matter political office, dipshits would still dipshits. let political bias cloud judgment. can’t tell - 100m $2b (rounded) 500m $2b? 
As pessimist, I’m reading mean $2b gets us 100m doses choice buy another 500m doses would likely $10b. 
In case, sounds like $20/pop hook for. 
I know nothing R&amp;D costs develop mass produce vaccine - figures seem reasonable? Today's republicans absurd stances trivialities really looking like late Soviet politburo. quit retail job March boss sick two weeks coming despite fact told handled. told got least bit sick wasn’t coming in. Sure enough, sinus infection days later, came back told CDC said ill employees shouldn’t in, said “I don’t *care* CDC guidelines!”

I’d sick January unknown thing turned really bad sinus infection, work, attitude, couldn’t take. would far easier allow loophole. wait line panderers support making serf? Way clump government organization together private enterprise. 

Not clever you? fact ‘ medical tourism’ actual thing says American healthcare. Nah san Antonio also struggling There's minor cold started going around neck woods time COVID cases really starting ramp around here. General stuffiness, coughing, sneezing, etc. everyone's playing ""Cold COVID?"". testing line loooooong past weeks. needs isolated, idiots clearly can't responsible actions. come on, that’s happening f.cking everywhere.. americans only. people europe claim “ wow look states, sooo inconsiderate” tell live (considered rollenmodell fight corona) people don’t give shit! dont kniw getting crazy states 59% say: “fuck masks it’s decision aswell” That's San Francisco downtown Los Angeles stereotype. California expensive rest country, exaggerated amount.  Maybe. people seem fine recovery, people side effects months later, one really knows long term consequences. 100k per day already several times past. days tested 70k+ 80k+ Always love edit get downvotes try make feel better  It’s bottle bleach new sticker slapped plus insider stock trading 

Part 10b5-1. Likely planned year 2 before, like people stock options... tech companies like this. Go get skills demand like night day way employer treat you. Womp womp. selfish! rational reasonable people went back work lockdowns ended. Send’em back school say! Everything’s fine say! ""oops"" rushing devastating debilitating side effects.

If vaccine based existing vaccine proven safety, risks going lower. AFAIK, ones later stages development fall category.

Some risk, small one compared novel approach. Well, frequency people stating long-term damage likely common greatly outsized evidence supporting it. looking evidence substantiates asymptomatic people getting long term damage, mild cases causing organ damage Imagine viruses everyone show symptoms. move along. Link proof? Post evidence, let's see have. See find people ever hurt vitamin C. much take, harm come to, link harm vitamin C? can’t deny that, problem I’ve read line incredibly slow politicized. make easier get green card, long stayed ‘in line’? According state DOH report linked 102,190 test results reported today. 1 365 it, 0.27% fraction percent like said.

1 13 trait 7.69%, also said.

Now realize 7.69% 100% Black population. grabbed random sample 100 Black americans, 8 would it, yet Black americans dying higher rate that. 

If SCT feature statistical model, would likely little predictive strength compared issues Black americans face 10x common SCT. He’s wrong. Shutdowns temporary suppression measure, soon open back spread begins anew. Because, argument made hospitals suspended elective surgeries, postponed treatments suspended cancer screenings plethora services hospitals provide preventative measures given local circumstances probably over-reactions given level community spread. lockdowns isolation result protections virus. new york city, watched fell apart. rest country laid business shuttered basing decisions death rate spread rate almost entirely located northeast small clusters major cities. numbers began subside peak reached metro area country whole breathed sigh relief USA hump. actuality, specific areas accomplished goal. States started opening beaten back virus actuality even scaled testing dealt issues ICU capacity, etc. 

I much realist comes virus. nearly enough protect country whole. ""All None"" mentality really really hurt us. nothing might worked smaller countries Europe, National mandates even State level mandates negative impact economy without question. absolutely organization Federal level states themselves, never supposed plans place deal situations like this, forced react fly. 

The problem discussing economy pandemic POTUS tried apply opinions economy macro level solution likely lied micro level. open EVERYTHING back up. Certain governors heard message took heart. ignored reality possibility coming states currently paying ultimate price. lockdowns occured states currently facing widespread community transmission almost entirely naught.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Shutting everything country benefited places widespread community spread exponential growth virus, simultaneously hurting places next cases. period time, contact tracing testing could scaled places without community spread prepare possibility resurgence neck woods. Instead went back business usual. People died completely preventable causes due overreaction places require strict mandates. nothing happened, lightened restrictions paying price. Knowing one infected going work anyway? Possible public endangerment charges. Though DA probably important/urgent cases prosecute. disagree masks worn everyone wear them, say ""there medical condition"" disengenous. Mesothelioma? COPD? grandmother Mesothelioma restricted house can't wear mask all, hardly walk 3 steps house without getting breath, wearing mask question, lungs weak point obstruction causes struggle get enough oxygen. Everyone wear one should, say one earth can't wear one ridiculous. mean... don’t apply Donald? met people Florida. adjusting behavior. get rona get rona. flu bro. C'mon EU NYC stopped indoor dining phase reopening far, curve still flat. hope lasts! smell lawsuit coming calling feds step respond appropriately, includes taking care everyone's needs pandemic. Extended PUA kickers, free healthcare anything covid related, monthly stimulus checks, whole nine yards.

Why lying position ***to me?*** really think paint positive light?

You need calm fuck lay playground insults. Judging way conduct here, looks like world better without business anyway. source claim viruses tend evolve less lethal forms? I've always assumed opposite. That's war crime right?  contract it, I’m basically screwed permanent damage body? flight August, anyone info air travel lately? i.e. many people average flight? retarded need positive result test 20%+ false negative rate ensure get sick leave

Take one step realize retarded get sick leave sick, regardless disease.

In rich, Western democracy, OP would've need post this. responsible reporting preprint Yahoo many suggesting deserve there? Since 1 enough, assume set number many children feel deserve orphans? comment baseless bc he's never done stupidly suggested would. are, whining Trump I'm sure that's really cared first place. I'm going bc good news regardless obsessed babies want. Go r/politics comments. get karma e-jerking there. case closed police unions? seem really protect own. never get vaccines I’ll getting one sure. Maybe first day, actually go ahead read comment, did. address instead ignoring American way. here's thought: test positive COVID text message sent contacts CDC. Maybe least written places follow rules. Often times employers try side employees start getting fined. there's still plenty places employ illegal workers care rules. mix across board. could reopen everything full capacity, wearing masks socially distancing. Work hard regain full employment mitigating viral risks. Unemployment checks can't last forever. thats actually good point discussion....

what good mental help youre high risk gonna catch anyway probably die?

and yet get downvoted? children here....  appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* 

## Abstract

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may occur multiple routes. collected aerosol samples around six patients admitted mixed acuity wards April 2020 identify risk airborne SARS-CoV-2. Measurements made characterize size distribution aerosol particles, size-fractionated, aerosol samples collected assess presence infectious virus particles sizes μm, 1-4 μm, &lt;1 μm patient environment. Samples analyzed real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), cell culture, western blot, transmission electron microscopy (TEM). SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected six rooms particle size fractions μm, 1-4 μm, &lt;1 μm). Increases viral RNA cell culture virus recovered aerosol samples demonstrated presence infectious, replicating virions three &lt;1 μm aerosol samples (P&lt;0.05). Viral replication aerosol also observed 1-4 μm stage reach statistical significance (0.05&lt;P&lt;0.10). Western blot TEM analysis samples also showed evidence viral proteins intact virions. infectious nature aerosol collected study suggests airborne transmission COVID-19 possible, aerosol prevention measures necessary effectively stem spread SARS-CoV-2. GBH Intent. obviously good thing, pissing wind bringing positive outlook round trump somehow caused  probably counting people's neighbors report them, see right arrive state.  get permanent damage Yes mere inconvenience reason can't TEMPORARILY go school attend sports activities.

Meanwhile people can't even eat work day, get grip. Happy Birthday hooman!! Take care 👽🧃  Regardless well kept quarantined far, traveling erases that. planning drive across country probably fine quarantine; however, packing food, sleeping car, pissing shitting side road, stopping fill gas sounds like hell me. part? pretty good job controlling within country. west actually leaders didn’t laugh virus wearing masks might better position right America winning cases, new cases per day, deaths, much winning; might even get sick winning. People leave phones home... electronic anklet. Yeah, didn’t US like UK did. opposing viewpoints factually incorrect. fucking arrest something. She’s clearly danger others, believe there’s crime called “Reckless Endangerment” something. People intentionally endanger others criminals. really first election! Politics utter nightmare Yea tell first time read notes. advisors shoved hands poll numbers. 1950's, perhaps. modern times. usual California spend 50% monthly take-home pay rent. 20% thing still true 95% California's population would homeless. That’s insane. California (San Jose specific) got results next day. testing breeze. Literally one line sign paper instant walk-up testing.

It’s fucked state response thing. *global* pandemic federal government can’t even step duty. former foster child difference lot college kids support net parents. can't afford pay kids rent per se absolutely can(and almost always do) support children ways. 

It infuriating seeing kids getting phones, insurance, food, etc. Paid parents saying get financial aid basically support net. #Tldr

around 31 percent 125 registered patients (british group) shown psychiatric abnormalities - hallucinations delusions, confusion disorientation, epileptic seizures, paralysis, headaches even brain infections (symptoms added article mentioned studys reports test group understand larger different test group germany reports) - 55-year-old woman example wanted seen lions monkeys house.

from british group: Ten patients suffered new onset psychosis, six dementia-like disorders - four patients diagnosed affective disorder, i.e. manic depressive episodes.

There already known cases Covid-19 associated brain inflammation. could triggered psychoses.

Edit: headline first Part proper spaced. Maybe length restriction fix it. Sorry that. Formated little bit (the tldr) make easier read. Added numbers tldr british group (erased also mistake made, sorry. Claimed 19 patients problems - false) still quarantine hotels... Even want enforce mandatory quarantine arriving travelers (which really really should, takes one person disregarding quarantine order start cluster), set quarantine hotels make available residents free least reduced cost. people dont anywhere quarantine without risking infecting families. wow #2 tldr different comment

The researchers found so-called light chain neurofilament (NfL), structuring protein nerve cells, increased infected, mild moderate Covid-19 course. saw sign Sars-CoV-2 cause damage nervous system even slight courses - possibly also permanently. ""This important closely monitor long-term neurological consequences persist Covid 19 infection,"" quotes ""Ärzteblatt"" study director Sven Wellmann.

Post-traumatic stress disorder

 chairwoman professional association German neurologists, Sabine Köhler, assumes coronavirus long-term impact psyche. necessarily due organic damage: ""We already seeing increase number patients mental illnesses practice,"" says. ""The corona crisis attacks people many levels life: many lose jobs, unable cope new social situation existential fears."" fears extraordinary mental stress could lead wave post-traumatic stress disorders.

Studies past pandemics shown psychological effects appear outbreak subsided. known psychological complications even previous pandemics. ""Especially among doctors nursing staff, i.e. people lot infected people,"" says Köhler. ""But affected relatives also suffer psychological complications."" That's next level stupid... you‘re fucking idiot 2% death rate .2% death rate people still want country shut joke #1 - tldr different comment

Possible long-term corona damage Covid-19 cause psychosis Covid 19 infection affects almost entire body - psyche. Researchers observed patients hallucinations perceptual disorders. Katherine Rydlink 07/19/2020, 10:12 p.m. learning new details Covid-19 since beginning year. First all, virus said trigger respiratory infection lungs could become inflamed. became clear: Covid-19 affects lungs, also heart, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract brain. know virus, becomes clear extensive disease affects entire system.

Scientists observed addition neurological symptoms, Covid-19 apparently also trigger wide range psychiatric symptoms. already known many patients complain smell taste disorders. Strokes, epileptic seizures, paralysis, headaches even brain infections also reported.

Several studies suggest Covid-19 also trigger psychosis. survey British doctors, result published specialist journal ""Lancet Psychiatry"", showed around 31 percent 125 registered patients Covid-19 shown psychiatric abnormalities. Ten patients suffered new onset psychosis, six dementia-like disorders - four patients diagnosed affective disorder, i.e. manic depressive episodes.

Scientists National Hospital Neurology Neurosurgery London also similar neuropsychiatric symptoms: study, described confusion disorientation Covid 19 patients. also recognized Guillain-Barré syndrome, lead paralysis. also observed psychosis: 55-year-old woman wanted seen lions monkeys house.

Many Covid 19 patients still symptoms weeks later senior physician reports: coronavirus attacks children's hearts Recorded Johann Grolle coronavirus attacks children's hearts term psychosis stands series symptoms affected perceive reality different way. Often hallucinations delusions, also thinking disorders, strong fears ego disorders. former British study specify type perceptual disorder patient in.

""A distinction made primary psychoses, cause unclear, secondary, organic psychoses,"" says Götz Thomalla, senior consultant neurology University Hospital Eppendorf (UKE) Hamburg. ""Organic psychoses result brain injuries inflammation, example."" already known cases Covid-19 associated brain inflammation. could triggered psychoses.

Permanent damage nervous system ""The question extent virus directly attacks brain,"" says Thomalla. ""The inflammation may also indirectly caused body's excessive immune response virus."" uncommon serious infectious diseases affect brain. ""The studies record psychiatric symptoms occur - actually causes them,"" explains Thomalla. ""The exciting question whether patients retain permanent damage whether organic psychoses heal completely.""

In past weeks, cases mild Covid-19 courses sometimes serious consequential damage become known: patients reported relapses manifested severe symptoms. far, doctors scientists yet know triggers them. According Thomalla, permanent damage nervous system brain could explain symptoms felt everyday life. ""The next step investigate that,"" says.

Doctors Kuno Children's Clinic St. Hedwig Regensburg similar view examined 100 doctors nurses, 28 tested positive Sars-CoV-2. still didn’t understand told read paper don’t add Trumpisms it. usa people politicians beyond crazy since fight logic science prove point! We’re headed next depression. Would awesome get vaccine think it’s going lot damage first. estimating millions start thing we’re months in. exponential growth heard lot certainly becoming noticeable devastating another 6 months. vaccine thing stop this. lived 8 people small 2 bedroom condo. to. probably like get used it. becomes reality.

I'd suggest get house order start judging others. simple ""stop kids can't afford"". agencies actually try combat issue fucking work. ain't birth control pendejo  semi related note, anyone else issues pharmacies meds stock? I've different pharmacies I've wait days meds daughter come huh wtf talking  Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* happens tell peole ""work, starve."" work. people voluntarily starve death.

A friend mine China says quarantine actual quarantine, in, escorted home door sealed food basic supplies next 14 days delivered leave home neighbors instructed call police get quarantine lock key solitary confinement cell catch you. guess that's happens functioning government play comes protecting people jerks. actually go quarantine moved provinces (like young Americans China he's English language teacher), theoretical thing him. 

Which one reason China mostly beat COVID-19 now. central government realized something could ignore sweep rug, sent whole state machinery play beating it. play around. took. that's happens there's actual functioning government, versus... well. one main reason west got caught flat footed pandemic exactly distrust 100% china says without looking mentality. yeah still lottery racist trash. ;-) Honestly, reports side effects (blood clots, neurological complications, chronic fatigue), thinking I’d take chances COVID, opposed vaccine. 

But info comes this, I’m thinking vaccine better bet. ""they're going get infected go home get better""

🙄 buddy mine lived Germany year work. described ""Like America everybody actually followed rules."" idea peoples lives come profits foreign concept US foreign agent trying destabilize US, yeah, would probably pushing conspiracy theories trying spread pandemic much possible. say 1/3 usually gross right? take home? know really thing right? Even was, talking MAYBE 5% error rate? positive COVID19 test required cause death needs listed COVID19 supporting evidence; falsifying information criminal offense, doctors would lose license. absolutely evidence happening. 

That said, numbers? percentage ""fudging"" would required? deserves jail sentence. That's attempted murder!! inside elite have. Let's real, thousands dying every day... single high profile anyone? single congress member staffer reports? big artists sports players? 

Come on, that's bit odd Covid ""doesn't choose"" extremely dubious claim. 30% population contracts virus, ""herd immunity"". They’re giving many companies money right now. Basically government willing spend whatever takes make sure enough doses approved vaccine also include probable cases deaths numbers. Whats new this? Even ""black plague"" exists 7 centuries. Trump would probably try claim victory saying ""I told Mexico would pay it.""  Let's stick topic👍

Expert believes recommendations considerate Denmark autumn. Stop friends evil people. Imagine reading TFA. store **doesn't** enforce mask mandate risking lives, too. Everyone's lives.  business owner can't say ""let's avoid conflict letting anti-masky people whatever want.""

Agreed! also want thank providing really good suggestions! Whether hiring bouncers, understand risks inherent employment, following surveil report protocol like generally case theft prevention, seem like pretty solid solutions. Oh, wish... :-/  another layer look at. step 1 is, getting virus. Step 2 goes two directions, symptoms symptoms. symptoms, journey ends likely. Step 3 symptoms either goes mild severe (obviously varying degrees). Step 4 Hospitalizations severe. Step 5 discharge death. steps go, higher IFR would go. Step 1 overall IFR someone else mentioned floating around .65% seems hard know many actual cases missing guess. happen every. single. time people getting paid trouble.

Or maybe paid alive.

It's cheaper feed house people let starve streets. need UBI. Look respect fact it’s religious thing

I don't. never respect ignorance idiocy able hide behind fairy tale book. Nobody should. Yup. last 10% cases would probably take around long first 90% (assuming immunity catching virus, anyway) live Texas, HEB curbside allows use food stamps. saw option last time got groceries. since concerned friends help volunteering shop since wear mask? can't shop mask alternative SHOPPING, need wear masks anymore.

If ""friends"" agoraphobia levels anxiety wearing mask, unfortunately probably used taking extra measures life accommodate anxieties (and sympathize), another instance work around it.

Do think would reasonable kick every person store shop peace fear crowds? no, course not. likewise reasonable allow anyone wear mask, except even worse case anxiety can't kill people around coronavirus can. Yep. library work keeping high risk folks home. workers contact tracing county.

You understand something vast ton variables play, right? E.g. kids single parents? one parent passes away COVID, passes away something else? death rate inevitably increasing hospitals start reach capacity?

If life simple multiplying 2 numbers together, pandemic, kiddo.

Also, getting mass downvoted usage math terrible, entire post incredibly tone deaf. pandemic even over! let's see much wealth society give billionaires. Sounds like report backlog.

I'm sure express disapointment strong enough words.  US ashamed they're handling this. Absolutely ashamed. 

I asked begining crisis, many people die get sick magnitude seriousness becomes obvious everyone? We're 145,000 dead that's it.  quarter half million? we've lost wars?  many people need die big deal? read article.  understand.

Prob didnt even wear mask. made kids orphans. That’s typical cases. sucks there’s justice good people die Pretty sure shouldn’t 11 children live poverty line. maybe line thinking didn’t exist her, hence poor first place. public health economic costs getting people vaccinated far outweigh costs vaccine itself.

Trump Virus  Live purple state. “Blue area” virus exploded first stable/decreasing rest state “red area” surging. Nearly 100% mask adherence indoors...I think past three weeks I’ve seen one person without mask gardening section Lowe’s “technically” outdoors think crime knowingly infect someone else life threatening, contagious virus tell them?

Seems pretty good society me, mention pretty evil.  4 excessively large me. Especially poor share living quarters two families. coronavirus different. lose taste smell things happening nose mouth coronavirus. taste smell going virus brain.  Speak everyone. Hang there! anti-science uneducated individual simply understand basic concepts scientific method, correlation, causation. 

Your science teacher ashamed. more-or-less use term freely already. social welfare programs. forced pay taxes. that's definition communism, already?

It's accurate view communism, seems one already prescribed to. contradicting said?  yeah actually

There batshit crazy homeless people DTLA  perfectly logical. used one cheap early antibody tests, would gotten incorrectly high number earliest test. happened many places, know antibody test used Indiana.

To get good numbers, would select group random retest every ~2 weeks. Since people may lose antibodies within month, regularly repeating necessary. Fuck him. Hope Trump next. world deserves better. time, rural health services generally level resources metro areas, local hot zone rural area may quickly overwhelm hospital. EG South Georgia early on. still good idea limiting spread rural areas wearing mask, imo. Seizure World? Heard funny story them. Apparently, 75 year-old residents hate 55 year-old residents noisy, argument 95 year-old residents 75 year-olds. Imagine ignorant.

Edit: take upvote friendly gesture mean roomies prob poor might huge medical bills now, fuck her. People hostile towards spreading misinformation without sources claiming people need research Dude, entire conversation interrupted based trump's use word.

If want discuss trumps use word, fuck butt all?

Next time use tour teeny tiny intelligence join conversation want have. start charging people attempted murder Yes.

There studies already, happened know it’s case SARS.

But largest study China published, far know. called thousands initially infected males follow up, it’s crickets since.

Interesting known large studies countries fertility (both male female, especially know SARS caused [high risk early pregnancies especially first second trimester). * Prior yesterday, Nevada's previous daily high COVID-19 deaths 22, set back April
* current death toll stands 704 Nevada Honestly, even frame ""only."" 24,000 62,000 flu deaths US last year per CDC. else equal, would mean based metric alone, 144,000 372,000 people would dead COVID-19 within years time, we've already passed first number four five months.

145,000 deaths horrific own, close 400,000 dead just... unfathomable. I’m aware. smart people aren’t rush go back spending hundred per week dinner drinks out. I’m hoarding cash peers Mitch better fix asap... rushing liability protection desperate give rich friends /s wife talked similar things recently think top-down problem. initially hesitant spring told masks help, find much later medical workers would enough masks. also issue Dump seemingly anti-science many want inconvenienced follow along that. think also aspect ""It happen me"" denial many people taking. teacher brought concern going back school told survival rate county 98%. understand people OK deaths schools hit point can't continue person anymore. terrifying. Right. know spreads stops it, take targeted steps. know, go might cause spread.

Next want see report saying could invested better stock market know stocks performed. probability test correct P(true positive) * P(true negative), would 70% * 80% = 56%? right? Meaning nearly half tests incorrect? Yes, we're going need one way another. Assuming vaccines 2-dose, we're going need 660 million doses vaccinate everyone, one company give us many once. Even end leftover vaccine, we've always got babies born need vaccinated, else fails, sell excess vaccines another country needs them. one cares. Worthless news Make decision every day? I’ve working home past 4 months, never leaving except essentials. It’s sucked is.

I didn’t think we’d go full circle end wind back square 1, comparing flu. difference flu know flu. We’ve studying century. vaccines it. know risk,the comorbidity.

We know JACK SHIT virus. long term effects? risk? people getting dying, others perfectly fine? effective really ventilators treatment? effective really masks? effect smokers? People vape? dangerous inside outside? MANY QUESTIONS.

It’s like people gambling lives families lives, hoping it’ll fine, what? eat chili’s? make another buck corporate overlords? (May relevant Americans).

If get flu, KNOW happen. I’ve before. understand risks, know I’m sick, shouldn’t go around grandma. happens get COVID? die asthma? girlfriend, history pulmonary embolisms risk? visit grandma asymptomatic get sick die? Tell mask reverses aging. time figure that’s true, vaccine. reality city Indianapolis state heavily rely Indy 500 drive tourism tourist $$$. Hotels, resturaunts, bars, etc absolutely surge sales weekend. 

The city/county/state/businesses severely strapped cash desperate carry event. 

Unfortunately, absolute doubt mind cause spike Indiana. can't 87,000 fans sharing food stands, bathroom facilities, etc come contact one another spread covid...don't even get started fact probably anti mask folks well sufficient people enforce this. Untill Donny manages fuck somehow. Even vaccines US soil I'm optimistic people going shot getting next year. Heh.....and ""positive"", probably meant simply antibodies.

Hope lessons learned there.... Stock markets hitting time highs guess true looking deaths per day multiply based mortality rate

The death rate heavily dependent age sex, also obesity plays significant role, ethnicity seems noticeable affect probability, calculations need complicated. personally would exclude nursery homes' residents calculations, among group people live close quarters percentage infections higher general population.

But yes, crude estimate number infections inferred number deaths divided IFR. study actually makes sense pretty much kids young adults fall NPD spectrum, 20-29 age range seeing spike cases engaging risky behaviors lot locations US. also help frame argument young adults need reign age based NPD. would 'main resistance'? Seems like banks intelligence people concerned about. comment touches question thought ask senator said hospitals claiming COVID deaths could get federal funds. can't completely counter it.

But want make one thing clear research topic:

COVID deaths give hospitals money perform billable COVID treatment patient.

It also makes zero sense would funds set aside hospitals sole reason someone dying COVID. still enough faith mankind immediately 99.99% doubt anyone would even propose idea, much less collection people approve it.

Hospital billing extremely complex. enough stories insurance covering treatments mistakenly coded incorrectly. may business know details funding going down, know enough immediately doubt research silly claim hospitals inflating death counts quick buck. There's way simple. absolutely heartbreaking. tearing reading this. religious services involve taking candy mouth sharing friends, walking around snot hanging nose, wrestling other. Rio Grande Valley lot people kicking screaming it, pretty clear plan worked. right severe cases go mild severe,give days... simply accurate.

Smallpox virtually eradicated.

Rinderpest 100% extinct. seen case 20 years officially declared gone.

Also ""never"" really long frigging time. government give shit anyone outside pocket. Oh male nurse basically write ticket. Everyone wants male nurse. is/will useful detecting emerging hotspots places drastic measures suppressed community spread.

Wastewater testing identify existence. pooled PCR testing identify individuals.

Completely doable- need leadership make happen true! anything hurts one ""own"" could anyone care -whatever affected by-??? Shocked Pikachu face Yes, agree. I'm primary pastor, plus by-laws extremely limiting, hard-line stance would take far. 

I agree, things deeply concerning. agree elderly. isolated, targeted misinformation, seem take risks, unable life online. tried helping people specifically, offering grocery shopping, etc. usually refuse it, since less afraid us. 

Also, sharing communal wine increasing capacity right insane, agree. purposely making policies intent kill (like Hitler Stalin) yes.

In case dereliction duty negligence believe choices this.

I believe case wishing forcefully removed office maybe prison time would non psychopath wish for. can't decide ice skating would fit list.
Maybe medium/high?
It's indoor activity indoor space pretty cold (my rink actually rather warm time year), people breathing hard aren't. 

You usually near people long, know much air gets moved around refreshed. 

We wear masks lobby social distance switching skates shoes encouraged stick around longer absolutely necessary.

I thought hard yesterday found family member another state covid (and preexisting health issues) taken hospital. thought ""I'll keep mask unless I'm far away everyone cuz plenty space group lessons"" it'll fine, I'm anxious it. I'm definitely participating starts cool though. Flu+corona go. Agree, general use masks Denmark current situation would immense waste ressources. god dumb... mean seriously, messing around.. really moron.

Fucking hell Thank you! Whoever downvoted tool. exactly point. Americans need take close look themselves.

For decades, Americans criticised places like China Vietnam saying ""life cheap there"" government people care people.

But none nations tolerated hundreds thousands deaths virus, tens thousands gun violence, easily Americans do.

If ""life cheap there"" said nation, US. 

If US badly, US government large proportion population simply care fellow Americans live die.

Americans Americans worst enemy. kill enemies combined. important (especially non-Americans) remember US really thought single country entity even though that's says map. US states large larger many nations, either area, population, economic output. 

Here's fun breakdown: http://www.decisionsciencenews.com/2015/02/20/put-size-countries-perspective-comparing-us-states/

In fact eight countries Earth size larger United States (Russia biggest twice size US). Almost quarter countries Earth size smaller Rhode island, smallest US state.

In Europe, travel 10 hours Berlin Paris, there's going lot difference two places. different architecture, different languages, different food, different politics, different *everything*, easy think two places different treat separately. US travel 10 hours am, whatever city end going essentially carbon copy different attractions restaurants. yet despite pretty much appearance level, underlying political social sentiments very, different.

Tl;Dr: one USA, several USAs connected thinly veneer appearance. get criticised extent people Anglo-sphere focused know jack India's situation politics, even compared East Asia, disproportionate amount Americans compared Indians. Also people quite sceptical could ever properly controlled India's slums. would guess situation India fatalities far worse reported. plenty Latin American countries horrible time main focus Brazil criticism Bolsanaro made ridiculous figurehead enabling virus. think understand why. rest us, vindication worldview somewhere region reality. us connected. islands unto ourseleves. Government role play global crisis like this. Etc.

For moment, ""other side"" reeling cognitive dissonance. must've painful. confusion silence felt like everyone one page. defense mechanism kicks we're back denial stage. piece shit. Speaking of, hear “welcome back kotter” theme song Applebee’s one fucking time... *Mexico starts building wall* really shudder think long could go without vaccine. people say it’s next year, vaccine not, man...there’s many people haven’t yet, doesn’t seem spread rapidly Spanish Flu. 

I really can’t imagine anything 12 months. Lost months one thing, lost years life-destroyer. know we're ""fuck China"" phase reddit hivemind, there's legitimate reason think China poorly far vaccine development concerned. Everyone going get sick. Everyone. goal slowing spread medical services help many people possible. Sick camps slow rate infection point. may made sense 3 months ago today would drain resources treatment facilities. Bud going get worse gets better. economy going collapse person toilet paper win. #madmax   chance. We're even phase 3s yet.

Hope early 2021. It'll still fastest vaccine ever gone market mean, already recorded dead guy hanged himself, else expect.

You 2 groups youtubers California.

The one group gone months, ones holding parties. Imagine denial much.

Edit:

You guys acting like party science. Science supposed biased like this. blatant manipulation facts.

Even agreeing protests absolutely arrogant ignorant say effect uptick.

Literally watch black lives matter protests, mostly maskless, chin, short ass bandanas best. I'll literally youtube right click first (tons people wearing masks background (again plenty people wearing (more people wearing masks/wearing incorrectly sides.)

Lots news clips like this, protesters wearing masks/wearing incorrectly (on chin count wearing it)

You guys genuinely disappoint me, supposed better. leads one willfully stupid?

Not Darwin'ed early enough. Without sort feedback mechanism, there's incentive course correct. Every behavior A-OK isn't. jail following quarantine child endangerment? 132,580 closures listed website July 10, 55% permanent, 14 percentage points end June, according Yelp’s Economic Wednesday. 72,000 businesses permanently shut down, California, Texas Florida accounting largest share.
 children irrational fears work help overcome fears, instead letting fears control life. child fear dogs, reasonable strategy would help get acclimated dogs let understand nothing fear. go rest life afraid something generally harmless, could actually positive affect life.

Good point would argue approach i'm trying take people legit anxiety able breath mask. Allowing face shields would similar introducing child dog. take kid throw kennel bunch dogs right? woudl ease it. Similarly ease people face masks getting use face shield maybe would able wear mask. I'm means advocating need let people shop maskless all. I'm trying find something help feel comfortable still helping others around adults fear mask however little different. irrational completely idiotic fear encouraged people like you, addressed. Instead helping overcome irrational fear, apparently saying let spew 'rona place of... feels guess?

I'm encouraging fears i'm simply trying make feel crazy fear can't understand. I'm trying, stated above, try find middle ground allow resume life without forcing something legit makes feel like going die, head. stated i'm saying get face protection card, way help others feel safe even yes is. somebody afraid somebody they're woman need accept that? black? walking kinda fast? afraid wear mask accepted tolerated; ignorance fueled false information. call is: bullshit.

This good point understand saying would venture say word use fears tolerated. fears still bullshit legitimately get anxiety situations, fears real. like teaching moments blasting moments, tolerated. blast start dropping n-bombs calling women tricks ho's, blast cross street see black person approaching leave room woman walks into, teach nothing fear.

Anyway main point i'm trying say people fear wear masks i'm saying try help get fear allow wear face shield alternative. secondly i'm talking people use anxiety excuse mask anxiety, people shitheads. recommend reading oxford vaccine. They're starting scratch. new process. methods use develop 'new' flu vaccine every year multiple strains. actually far safer perception 'rushed' vaccine. makes challenging identifying right strains tuning sensitivity COVID-19. Unfortunately trust science successfully deteriorated much days hard filter BS, doubt, skip tabloid headlines go source: thought free market supposed efficiency sort thing out? worst worst. Sad part many children look want like them. literally nothing special losers. Nice! comment makes sense context article. I'd like go staple mask every Trump flag neighborhood. School obviously missing. Kids way less sanitary, much physical contact less awareness risk office workers. High category. 6x deadlier might deserve “good news” tab. Nationwide, it’s hovering near 30x deadly. Though 2.8% isn’t nearly enough start talking “herd immunity”. thing makes much sense, ultimate unsaid goal corporatize economy fully. seem ones raiding coffers, ones capable withstanding bad year. can't nice things! Mask deniers need shipped island. Go run society. I'm considering starting again. could get Walgreens deliver bill FSA card, I'd happily light per day. 

I'm reminded scene *Sleeper* future Dr encourages Woody Allen stop silly smoke tobacco best thing him. said thing brother America, watching collapse. said covid even thing, fast forward. Nice article April, quite outdated, dont think? cute attempt 😘 Username checks lol  food ain't gonna microwave itself. Nope. completely different technology compared vaccines far. Maybe Trump knows he’s going lose reelection, he’s trying crash burn everything democrats? That’s bought 3M full face gas mask Kevlar vest. family thinks I’m legitimately insane I’m considering getting too. Strongly considering buying gun well, I’ve never gun person I’m sure point would anyway. Yup, everything internet conspiracy now!! fun Indeed. I’ve working site whole “event”, helping keep organization running. demand take rushed vaccine would asinine. Crazy! Yeah healthcare workers anyone 75 first line, questions asked. watch America tear apart Trump decides Republican states get vaccine first, whole sports teams get vaccinated first America get back entertained old people die, etc.

And going anti-vaxxers refuse let elderly parents immunocompromised children get vaccinated. many ways say respond personal attacks beyond pointing they're personal attacks. Hopefully mutates soon something less lethal like Spanish Flu did. see fellow Van B Boy. commented “testing” got something like 24 downvotes. said need testing. People sub testy sensitive say 😂  tried order high quality tests wuhan, amazon sent knock-off cdc crap. Lots things including lower quality health care, lower rates follow (common among poor), higher levels obesity. Higher levels undiagnosed issues, higher prevalence working lower wage facing public, lower education levels etc ‘Prevention’ higher priority ‘treatment’. important. actually one! monitoring thanks anyway though Yeah it’s shitty companies handling whole situation can’t put 100% blame them. you’re person can’t go 13 days without pay check need seriously look budgeting managing money better. Employees employers working team get employees shouldn’t expect employer lay take huge hit. Smaller businesses can’t survive that. opinion matter take leave it. not, could go wrong seeing current inhabitant really make others want wear mask? segments American population indecisive processing medical information need see wearing mask so-as make call themselves? Lifelong best friend mine anti-mask, thinks COVID completely fake, hoax, etc.  Someone showed current inhabitant's clip yesterday wearing masks instead marginally agreeing instead doubled down, ""awwww....he's become sellout now! whatever China telling him!"".  base turning him. People pulling neck gaiters too, careful put hands, touching people objects. 

And get started pulling masks go use public bathroom. proceeding cough, yell, talk, grunt, etc. exit little handwashing. see daily job. see careless.

Assume retail worker shopper infected, avoid public restrooms whenever can.

Don't let Americans visit countries learn manners. might SIX times deadlier flu, it’s also 2-3 times contagious.

The flu also doesn’t often cause strokes, lifelong lung damage neurological conditions many patients never fully recover.

The end result devastating. Kansas mostly rural low level Infection already? seem bad idea...especially since majority Kansas really densely populated compared states like Florida California. believe something leader doctorate quantum chemistry working scientist.

By contrast, US President brags fact identify picture elephant. needs law . Even it’s serious fine. testing positive failing isolate considered endangerment .. test positive goverment also needs make law employer still needs pay reembursed fema .. start taking serious people studies country shown this. antibody studies Florida, Indiana New York. CDC tests 10 areas. tests done everywhere they're working it.

Why would true 10-15 areas everywhere else? virus. percentage people exposed varies based population density factors almost certainly way higher reported.

Some we’re talking!

That much accurately depicts handling coronavirus case mismanagement rather incompetence scared see pandemic average life expectancy number already trending due opioid epidemic. wearing masks properly obesity rate black folks particularly high. India's death curve purely exponential. Give month. help them, complain, let like, complain. Fuck people.  see eerie rant...now im branded suicidal. 

but yeah dont understand people right now.....maybe suicidal? That's terrible. could nothing done these, government spit tax money put work this. Unfortunately mods slacking deleting edited titles. understanding logic either. would much cheaper US eat cost purchasing free vaccines citizens drag economic disruption. see joke. Back 1300-1400 cases cities shutting back down. Everyone supposed wear masks job one coworker still wear one. said day, ""I would probably wear thought would actually help me."" energy try explain help her, wear might help others. What? January countries taking seriously good reason time so. hand armed reopen protesters several cases traced protests. successfully invent vaccine soon China gives them. woman living 15 roommates California responsible health entire nation. So, saying is, study says body forget deal virus 3 months matter body remember deal virus even forgets. OK. think understand. Yes, absolutely mean susecptable reinfectuon. overseas citizens

after looking overseas, wouldnt want go back either time...especially us... No, really pick two only. People confusing sensitivity accuracy. PCR extremely sensitive test -- way sensitive needed surveillance. less sensitive test -- one shows ""positive"" person lot viral particles inside -- what's needed. 

Why? folks transmitting active virus tiny amounts inside them. transmit active virus folks viral load high. folks want find quarantine surveillance testing.

Less sensitive tests *way* cheaper faster PCR, that's need right everyday testing. Right, suppose *did* children would accused wanting teachers die I’m lazy homeschool. allowed opinions. ratio pure toxic vitriol versus actual rebuttals sources comments really something

Edit: add, opinion isn’t even controversial outside echo chamber. Schools opening everywhere  change CCP vaccine... Listerine? Right, that's kind quality-of-life thing motivate immigrants move countries.

San Bernardino County reported 222; Riverside County, 256; L.A. County, 281. Wednesday, trio suburban counties fared worse: San Bernardino County 408 new cases preceding 14 days per 100,000 residents; Orange, 399; Riverside, 391; Los Angeles, 372.

run headline way run headline. *&lt;fingers Issue know tell they're real deal paper masks stamped ""KN95"". binary. lockdown help economy, avoid lockdown screw economy. Depends stakes. 

Winning free soda? Yeah, pretty low. Dying? don’t want 3% chance dying.  I'm going ask source Tegnell stated certainty 6 months. based question boss press conference last week asked question (while Tegnell still away vacation) immunity said something along lines coming many reports around world different numbers know, say 6 months see re-infections yet (it relation risk groups anti bodies might dare move bit society) Try watching something Breitbart. heavily funded companies want keep economy open, people still spend money pay taxes. totally agree pulling kind scam doubt would drag 3 positive tests like this. would one done leading triumphant return holding rallies shaking hands saying ""see took week I'm back 100%. proves virus biggie!"" 

Drawing like makes stance look worse true concern. 

Also way acting leading problem believing could legit contracted it. Reckless doesnt even begin describe actions.  understanding see others view actions bad but, incapable processing guilt remorse, view problem others, themselves. may see others moral compass, even enter picture decision-making process worldview. Dueling banjos I'm kind glad country collapsing, want civil war let's get started already people going die November speed lot people know, mostly rejection ~13 rooted corruption. Workers Party became pretty much epicenter corruption political class many people saw alternative.
Backfired thought son heavy investigation suspicious bank activity, due Bolsonaro recently tried intervene Federal Police snoop confidential files investigation Genuine question, long spend phase 2 long vaccine typically spend? didn’t find anything google suggested average time vaccines phase. I’ve seen however, vaccine typically takes 10-15 years total. Phases 1-3 take “several years”, I’m going assume means 3 more. Right aimed what, 18 months start finish? It’s ridiculous someone hesitant kind medication rushed aren’t immediate threat. terminal cancer, yeah you’re going roll dice. you’ve already COVID experienced minor symptoms, may worth you. everyone got vaccinated! one said deserved die, factual fat, asthma, put much severe risk. endorse discrimination level ignore blatant truth. either. That's politics works. think we'd get support came say Trump big bully? agree. 

I Ontario too. mean, seem lot pointless sports. America #10 deaths per million, behind UK, Spain, Italy, Sweden, France. course deaths raw numbers, large population. mean country would leave documents behind?

according fb US would, maybe know get hacked easily lol. make face shields. People people leading shit.  One issue pre screening example true positives meet criteria pre screening. symptoms know exposed infected person. Say 10 50 true positives. 10 people quarantine be.

It's difficult complicated situation think perfect solution exists. We've got try find best one Ok, literally get money afford deposit rent new place I'm asking. I'm saying they're incapable, I'm saying poverty famously extremely difficult climb of. propose people literally savings relocate? India one lowest deaths per capita. population huge deaths still less 30,000. ""This virus go away eventually done does, stop worrying get back school, work, socializing.""

I'd say something Trump would say, many coherent words. depends prevalence disease people testing , overall pretest probability like every test. 


If none corona positive false positive. corona negative false negative. He's two weeks yea basically whole south, everytime went ppl florida drove way here... Also, keep fluids like normally sick body much better chance start deteriorate all. Arm best nutrition wise! fine, think!  one state though, rest country practically virus free besides NSW well, 10 cases per day. find KN95 masks almost effective N95 masks.

Edit - added N hate Trump don’t take endorsement administration. 

The Feds agreed purchase 100M doses option purchase 500M more. standard practice base purchase options. also purchasing companies. allows government flexibility purchase ever source ability deliver effective fastest also giving company guarantee minimum purchase make work worthwhile. never seen vaccine trial require person take Tylenol injection. Like part trial. masks negative reactions virus, it. fine recommend already approved matter patients reaction is. street name may ""court"" plenty people (at least Ontario) would describe area ""cul-de-sac"". living 16 people, I'm going guess absolutely could afford work rolled dice lost everyone around her.

Meanwhile McConnell laughs premise extending pandemic insurance (the $600 p/wk).  respond personal attacks beyond calling such. tbf, asshole everyone Russia North Korea I'm work read article. Please someone tell charged *something!*

This Grade bullshit.

Edit: reading thread, understand people *need* work. bad situation, that's case. That's govt company can't take time paid situation. Really sucks. Uhh build wall north LA. LA far cases. Yes. vaccines 100% coverage always legitimately can't get one medical reasons. need herd immunity. Hopefully antibodies developed vaccine we'll enough coverage. Good luck different BoJo responded.  Figure present regime gets reelected November USA goes full shithole status good.

That would safe bet. Yup. That’s me. Someone pointed returned vacations summary consisted entirely ate:-). live Florida, eating currently, go extremely times, eat outdoors much possible. wonder like HIV. people seem susceptible virus go dormant infection keep reoccurring.  northeast keep trying help south figure do, half time come back ""yeah deaths!""

No fucking shit. like watching bunch people walk traffic get hit cars, we're telling stop! they're saying ""don't worry, I'm dead yet..."" appreciate advice! live California getting really expensive. would like move another state similar politics climate California we'll see ever comes fruition.  crazy thing way around people dying pneumonia labeled pneumonia covid testing readily available death count HIGHER LOWER covid deaths. didn’t invent virus. cause spread though. Notice we’re country world numbers high? 20 percent unemployment acceptable you? needed lead didn’t. Still isn’t. It’s fault. I've spreading word. Thank clueing in. sounds like house full illegal immigrants. younger worked restaurants common talking cooks send money home families. binary. Economy vs Lockdown.  

Totally mortality important consideration.  Public health policy based many factors. one stays hospital common cold. Exaggerated comments dont make strong point. guess i’m overwhelmingly disappointed ohio. broke standard handling this, bullied director health resigning, people driving level 3 counties lower level counties don’t wear mask, every night bars restaurants packed, governor quote bit bible says “alright wear masks y’all see ya later”

it feels like we’ve forgotten danger, know either stupid afraid look this. cling people medical background saying it’s big deal absolute truth, rather american thing looking one another keeping us safe.

i’m ranting, young person getting glimpse world people age inheriting, shit sucks big time. thats crazy here, im eastern idaho neighbor exposed it. time got test results back would middle all, luckily neg still. heard Twin smaller towns around test less 24 hours turn around. 

&amp;#x200B;

Im lucky fact company pay stay away get neg test think exposed  accuracy, sensitivity. tests designed find cases people transmitting -- huge loads virus.

If borderline detection limit show ""negative"" today, virus replication inside you, show ""positive"" tomorrow. stay home. people teeny tiny intelligence think countries US suffering Pandemic well.

I know countries suffering well, first world country suffering way U.S. is. 

Why refusing acknowledge this? making shit whose fault that?? 

China response. countries took precautions early still suffered thousands deaths . Shall blame Trump too?

No, never said suggested to. said rename effects American populace him. country Norway, 255 people dead. took precautions early still late 255 people died. China had, instead covering facts, warned world early massive fuckup made people many countries US would probably alive. 

Absolutely, china held account that. never said otherwise. obsessed US even think that.

Again, making shit up? absolutely acknowledge Chinas role fucking world.

Why refuse acknowledge Trump's role fucking U.S.? Could also “we bragged decades ability hol’ house elements apocalyptic world months years. reality beat last boss Netflix pretty quick, wife needed haircut words ‘new normal’ annoying let’s go die economy!” keeps testing prove testing wrong...how working? Rabies terrifying, also requires direct contact via bite. could get rabies around infected animal while, think Europe would able contain handily. Ooh, Steven must thread, got downvote! Hard /s there. Unfortunately no. Think playing hockey puck virus. far side rink shooting pucks teams net....pretty easy goalie even pretty far away (A whole rink distance equivalent someone room, shooting puck like sneezing, infect people across room)

Now think putting goalie net. harder score goals side rink, shoot enough shots, eventually get one in. also makes difference goalie kid, schmoe street adult, professional.

Now imagine goalie right front blocking shots another goalie net across rink. shot blocked pretty effectively.  Governor Abbott, Governor Ducey, Governor Desantis enjoy/ like death. reasonable explanation I've able come this. Seems like he's now. possible he's recovered since re-infected? America don’t let science dictate decision making. 2 weeks ago 15 years old got tested positive town next live. told stay home, went party wanted see friends. Results. 70 people infected town. started her. Late stage capitalism work friend mine COVID continued test positive month longer feeling symptoms.  Cunt subscribe guy Medcram. great channels timely info virus. Poverty that, man. Try living minimum wage.  People need look India's curve really wanna understand pure exponential growth looks like morning learned resources available appears first glance, light that, I'm done defending her. agreement. anything, line defending reckless actions got infant infected. 

I think definitely lot room improve means making need aid aware available need it. would compare HIV easily transmissible virus like coronavirus. happens magic Interestingly, quite people Spanish Flu knocked back completely first, felt lot better got bed, died overdid quickly. Actually I'd much rather tax dollars go keeping small businesses afloat country collectively lock actually gets thing control. alternative much worse small business owners. Many businesses could survive month lockdown can't survive year revenue even 30%, hospitals fill bet revenue going down. Ah, makes sense. New York here. expecting control pandemic billion people extremely densely populated cities U.S, third population spread evenly knowledge virus months early, even handle getting people wear masks? Since can't even understand difference paragraph sentence there's point back forth argument yep infertility cases Well can't help think scenarios like Infected person picks bag potato chips. Carries around while, decides get puts back Shelf. Along comes another person picks bag chips, brings home half hour later opening bag gets germ hands stick hand bag start eating chips. Boom, infected. 
Like stated before, literally takes second spritz item. Covid germ however, live surfaces Week. Sociopathy (or psychopathy) pretty much untreatable conditions. manage them, aware personality disorder helps avoid situations, clinical sense, telling people like Trump Bolsanaro ‘get help’ essentially means admitting something severely restricts ability get life without causing damage everywhere go. problem friend. Here's link CDC saying fact makes lawsuit super intellectually annoying.   I'm sure anti-vaxxers help reduce competition lot :)

I think people happy healthcare workers vulnerable (e.g. 80 elderly 5-10% death rate) go first new vaccine.  Man, that's fuckin' bullshit.  time place disgusting discussion. Admittedly, laws negative effect HIV awareness public health general. seems like good idea surface, backfires put practice. Even cases overt recklessness, personal injury lawsuit better remedy criminal charges. world's slow learners, horribly acting greater good. understanding protecting others also protect ourselves. It’s effectively free far average American concerned. something paid taxes, “feel” free, largely taxes aren’t optional. refusing ineligibility certain government goods services doesn’t mean tax bill lower. Damn. guys hiring? certainly contaminated places say local gym right now. gym smells like Clorox factory employee non-stop cleaning things. Never seen grocery store clean anything soneone touched except shelves. watch people pick up, read ingredients put back item item leavinh germs it. encouraging reckless behavior economically driven decision making? political decision making. 

Economically driven decision making would adamant importance wearing masks opening could sustainable. 

Please stop saying reckless governors prioritizing economy. idiot governor GA said suing Atlanta requiring masks sake businesses, businesses want everyone wearing masks stay open employees willing work! prioritizing politics. Coronavirus still Bolsonaro testing positive third time   studies coming SPECIFIC REGIONS, infections 10-15 times higher reported. different claiming. I'm telling finally support building wall.

Between LA Orange Country.. county follow basic protocals...is difficult? You’re losing November probably going jail. Fix virus lose.  yet see one valid arguement nicknaming ""the China virus""

It spawned China.

It predicted spawn China.

The factors leading virus' birth known, presented Chinese authorities. Chinese authorities represent Chinese people.

China chose uphold tradition ignore danger signs. again. Even know, wet-markets back up.

If Switzerland wet-markets scale, declined heed warnings potential yet another Sars branch spawn, Coronavirus spawned there, would definitely Switzerland virus.

The reddit hive mind hipocrisy appaling. already said before. anything new say? think spamming message someone distract fact think failing lock properly allowing 5k ""success""?!?!? already saw New York east coast. need see repeat that. wonder Americans feel shame embarrassment point. whole point people oppose don’t care. *laughs nervous Russian traitor accent* problem idea deaths even though cases currently up. Deaths peaked around April, severely testing point. likely many actual cases March April compared even today, that’s deaths high. can’t accurately compare confirmed cases testing poor March, positive test rates reaching 50% back then. “But don’t want wear puffie shirt!’ Putin told protests generally happened outside, lot protesters wore masks, protesters presumably drunk. significant mitigating factors. Well, duh. course safe go school among thousand students without mask social distancing. rocket science figure out. lot people (me included) believe complete eradication smallpox may greatest technological achievement human race. required tremendous expertise, vast resources, long-term commitment, ton international cooperation - exactly nothing like ever happen again. Yes. first thought too. Lol. Viagra win! Poor Spain literally ZERO idea talking about. act like gym universal design everywhere. gym uses sprays kill viruses surfaces 30 days. spray everything twice month. also specific air conditioning units installed filters kill viruses air. also limit amount people gym, mandating masks use. mask = cant come in. California plastic mini rooms setup never come contact anyone. weights everything private Norway, Gymgoers Avoid Infections Virus Recedes  unusual experiment, researchers found coronavirus infections among thousands people allowed return Welcome Dumbsville Yes things explain 80% drop hospitalizations. many hospital beds, Arizona 80-90% while. 5x many hospitalizations would show somewhere.

But think are. think simply many serious illnesses. millions protesting streets didn’t? hey! hung someone yesterday outside wasn’t wearing mask (dumb decision know thought would wear one). woke today feel like shortness breath idk it’s head bc i’m freaking virus. tell, know it’s early get tested it. need study prove that. obvious. parts Italy Sweden double figures Bergamo Stockholm. Living conditions population density incomparable Europe anyhow. headline saw free **OR AFFORDABLE**

$4,500 pop saw first We'll wait see. cases patient felt mostly fine condition suddenly deteriorated. no, share bathwater. Clearly I’m American prefaced saying acknowledging article wasn’t America comment.

Congrats read.

Edit: typo former roommate something like me. process moving back apartment week. go apartment grab bed see roommate living greet her. week later start feeling sick went get tested covid came back positive. ask friend roommate tells sick week that's found got covid her. friend happy her. What? In-person teaching insanely important youth development. Granted, it’s less important keeping safe light pandemic, rewards highly outmatch risks going school anomalies like one described. Considering many anti mask folks I've seen also saying refusing vaccine, I'm sure I'll still wearing mask limiting activities yet Donnie?  Struggling cope /= coping completely agree, think estimate coordination. can't get majority US population wear masks time. may never able get everyone injected something time.

Try creating law backfire, attempt forced immunization go much worse typical plea get people vaccinated. Same! I’m currently working home. people office opted keep coming in. even remotely ill (or even runny nose) sent home. get positive test back company giving us admin leave since unprecedented shouldn’t use sick leave pandemic situation. don’t know people aren’t employees. Currently paying ~$3200 755 sq. ft. including utilities, gotta love SF. love people mock small business owners who, God forbid, don’t want see business worked build collapse fail. post one, here’s another: also nurse recall fb live videos infection recovery, ended newly acquired diabetes died couple weeks later. Oh, probably not. kneel blm, let whole state die covid kneel sight. Well, they're wrong. multiple anecdotes under-reporting COVID deaths multiple anecdotes labeling patients COVID deaths w/o even testing them.

That's using excess deaths determine true fatality COVID logical approach. dick. fan Joe Rogan all. 

It’s like Trump- gets tested daily everyone around gets tested daily. reason doesn’t feel need wear mask since daily negatives. least wear symbolic way lead followers!! everyone fucking luxury test DAILY get daily affirmations close social group negative. Ugh See Donnie! wasn’t hard! Yea. Baby shower gonna Zoom. real bummer her. believe put pan moon  nothing Bernies platform person. issue supporters acted. I'm uk tested 7pm, results emailed 6am. California behind? Subjective wording, course, it’s obviously killing lot people millions catching virus. 

But wouldn’t ever call 3% chance something happening “extremely high.”  believe referring current daily rate total cases. Sounds like South Africa say people like this, knowingly go way endanger people charged terrorism charges. Remember stupid challenge licking ice cream putting back freezer store?! people charged terrorism charges, idiots like person.? Gyms indoor dining opening Ontario weekend certain areas province. really hope doesn’t mean incoming resurgence us late pandemic. considered phase 3 us meanwhile Toronto immediate surrounding areas cleared yet phase 3. heard ""two weeks"" many weeks, way past point getting back work. Well, think understood hospitalization rates falling, big news potentially good news.

There studies coming showing 10-15 times many people virus previously reported. simple explanation lot people virus symptoms find test widely, ramp testing find lot cases severe, overall hospitalization fatality rate goes way down. Florida: ""Hold alligator"" guess got tired two weeks narrative decided ""ah fuck 6 months."" never vaccine? common cold vaccine we've trying get one since 1950s. type American need of! Imagine anti-mask idiots WW2. Wear mask, limit number people, keep gym doors open. People need work stay healthy. Thanks living user name egregious false equivalence. somehow places south east Asia kicked corona dick can't ever truly eradicate virus resvour wild. could eliminate smallpox try polio measles exist humans. May need halve vaccines using boosters. Without new lockdowns? school open? 2021 later. Norway opened back long time ago. still much better Sweden didn’t get new spread.

So definitely mistaken, actual proof instead rely belief system. either quarantine facilities chose use them

Health care workers camping tents put household risk. selfishness level least.  oop north. say something like culdy sack Clearly you, American, commenting American European thread. Thankfully guest bathroom that's plus. 

And viral dose biggest concern. wear masks careful go out, get small dose get it. one us brings home true infectious symptoms even show up, 2nd person could looking much significant load I’ll honest, flew last week (granted, American Airlines) noticed everyone around really adhering rules. Northern California Texas...so, expected worst. Everyone wearing masks terminals, one real Karen-esque moment 4 flights. thought finally cleared crazy hump, show Reddit bunch horror stories. Guess got lucky? THIS. f'ing angry.  take money gave away airlines build factory(s)! could given damn thing 3M said Run It. airlines might actually able fly safely people could found useful employment. again, expect nothing I'm still disappointed. concern people *aren't* getting reinfected. Chronic infection would soooo much worse potential reinfection mere 3 months. least defend reinfection PPE. definitely abuse term free designed make drug companies look good. headline say U.S. government buys 100 million doses distribute free. Forever? It’s going away. Thanks, president rest world. Labs* 
There fixed personal attack responding *other call such*.  already waste, btw. Well got infected COVID19. Vaccine free. Delivery charge: $1000 $10000 depending... everything political usa lol think might confusing lower death rate low *amount* deaths. It’s thing. Kind like vaccine common cold? might one even flu vaccine around 20% effective. mean, happen, sure, explain everyone FDA historically one strictest agencies internationally, many drugs approved countries allowed US.

Obviously things change, see much reason distrust. play devil's advocate, sounds like picking battles. I'm saying right, much policing low wage store employees expected do? Polio smallpox eradicated United States decades. Completely eradication definitely possible countries countries, particularly middle east, hostile vaccination programs various reasons. Polio essentially already eradicated worldwide outside Afghanistan Pakistan. R never stable.

This mistake early Imperial Colleges made. ""Assuming current rate holds, 40m people die.""

Yeah that's works. Rt matters. Rabies eliminated Europe obviously disease wild animal reservoirs. 

Vaccinating wild animals vaccinations bait food possible. obviously Rabies absolutely terrifying disease corona-virus inspire fear. think would worthwhile invest resources. Right. Get fat become susceptible severe covid! Hospitals likely need bailed find can't collect people dead work due health issues. government bail out, accidentally discovered public health care, way many extra steps.

Bravo! McConnell quoted giving hard ""no"" asked extending $600 ui benefits. 

Lots unemployed Kentuckians ears seemed perk fun little fact...hopefully remember time vote.  28 year old cousin found cancer lump neck grow sore wouldn’t heal doctors would *finally* see him. got put several months.  Still don’t know kind cancer is. yea I’m kinda camp maybe things (like doctors offices) open.

My fiancé got dental care Thailand said super clean cheap good better dentist saw US. good bad people fear winter COVID, social distance. Obviously slow spread. it’s also gonna destroy economy. COVID-19 care ideology political affiliation. affects everyone.  
 
I know popular narrative moneyed interest groups trying push right political 'fear porn', reason freaking right political advantage (at least America, also seen false narrative pushed UK, probably true countries I'm watching well).  
 
Nope, reason everyone freaking 600,000 people died worldwide, 146,000 died United States far, another 60-80,000 expected die November 1st. countless thousands/tens thousands/more die America that, well 2021. Even vaccine developed, takes many months distribute, even know effective be, there's disturbingly large number say REFUSE anyway, enough throw concept herd immunity window.

Dude, pointing ONE GROCERY CHAIN accepting online orders ebt therefore stock many basic items people need option order another grocer complaining? JFC, dim. want hate someone badly missing entire point comment. 

Let break you:

1. Wal-Mart currently grocery chain U.S. cities accepts grocery pickup delivery orders rely EBT feed families. Either people order long wait times also able get necessities weeks time, shop person.

2. article talked needing grocery stores stop letting people inside shop. 

3. Wal-Mart chain U.S. cities accepts EBT grocery pickup delivery, grocery stores switch online ordering only, many Americans difficulty obtaining basic necessities Wal-Mart cannot possibly keep things stock people would choice use cannot access another store person order elsewhere online. 

4. know, option places order pay EBT pickup delivery majority grocers majority United States. 

5. simply pointing idea ordering online would put many Americans disadvantage. points March-May, wait time grocery pickup Wal-Mart tiny city, week. stock way better stores accepting online ebt orders shop person obviously.

6. thankful never said wasn't. reading way much comment want angry.

7. Even people use EBT difficulties obtaining pickup delivery time slots. happened get lucky times logging early morning hours snagging spot. 

Shipt, instacart, Kroger, Wal-Mart, Meijer, name it. damn near impossible sometimes get necessities without going person points previous months. previously worked shipt, system completely overwhelmed many weeks time. dropped orders left right. also even accept ebt orders. Wal-Mart worst stock necessities sheer amount people using ebt get pickup delivery since grocery store entire state takes ebt pickup delivery. 

The idea good one, work unless grocery chains accept ebt online. People still keep shopping person meet needs change. commondreams.org may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

You first. Quiverfull people. reason nightmare them. logistics effort behind trying get shelters would backbreaking immense. time, keeping shelter situation past would let disease spread like wild fire get caught rock hard place. Six Flags too! forcibly jail people like pandemic over? detectable neutralizing antibodies they've lost immunity reinfection. thing. us state school district actually taking seriously many starting online still, policy one kid tests positive one kid quarantine. staff kids class. nuts. Unfortunately... saying deep fake? want believe it, I'm hard time. Rt places 1.0, indicating exponential growth hasn’t occurring recently. can't. hospitals running 100%+ capacity. Funeral homes completely booked. Crematoriums running non-stop. Mass graves used. bad. Really bad. Pretty much nothing sickness death far us see. 1000 deaths yesterday- they’re starting catch really high case numbers you’ve seen past weeks. It’s going 1000 today. plan disease &amp; anything else threatens humanity way humans really ever ( killing millions indiscriminately) close eradication possible think polio smallpox. No, they’re eradicated, came sooo close, many people anymore either. plan one. I've started hearing versions last month so. CDC one I've heard though. think true, curious CDC even sends letters. said Agree. food won’t help they’re dead. Schools open months Switzerland, Netherlands Sweden criminal offense infect people covid19 intentionally? Yay that’s birthday! You’re ignoring whole part black people likely worse credit score why. That’s evidence you’re ignoring. can’t even acknowledge reality you’re ignoring order argue something never said.

If can’t address I’m actually saying, stop talking. You’re talking past order avoid talking issues discussion.  reminds college kids Westchester outright refused quarantine talk contact tracers. 

They give shit. Parts Phoenix higher rent per square foot. mean high risk kids kids high risk parents? right. I'm sorry. actually close 0.4% death rate.

**10-19 years counties higher obesity rates might lower population density. Compare bowards obesity rate similarly denties counties. Death rates hard compare temporally initial wave testing criteria changed.

Lead-time bias creates effect people appear living longer, reality increased surveillance catching cases earlier disease course.

We getting better keeping people alive. study quality life survivors have. many weeks, months, years full lung capacity (if ever).

The ongoing cost care covid survivors become insurmountable Americans, especially without insurance. Hospitals likely need bailed find can't collect people dead work due health issues. government bail out, accidentally discovered public health care, way many extra steps. want make freak more, built bug-out bag, look it. perfectly responsible thing anyway regular old emergency management(storms, floods etc)

Edit: make sure hide hard cash it, can. didn’t give father though. gave step mom baby sister too. think mistake assuming right decide impact. 

It's like bar owner thinks get decide someone drunk drive. 

That's works.

She thinks staying 6 feet away good enough. 

First customer watch for, second likely good enough especially people start taking masks off.

In close environment recycling air conditioning like grocery store, someone sneezing, coughing possibly even breathing heavily could release virus particles would stay around long time products shelving. 

I idea person mask shopping second 'I minute ago. 

The point mask wearing time, yes that's almost certainly overcautious point sure base level precaution necessary.

Masks 6 feet apart magic cure disease, lowest bar reasonably impose people significantly help. even adhering even take basic precautions. 

This like taking 1 10 layers rain coats. like poking holes thin plastic bag using raincoat. Except comes boobies. Breastfeeding bad holy hell anyone dare even think sunbathing topless. thank Trumpzilla slowing testing. Half-assed measures ignorant public. Sounds familiar?

Some beaches HK packed last week visitors said exhausted new measures wanted take break figure way. Everyone's situation different, disposable income make sacrifices sorts make happen. problem people get stuck accepting familiar, even best them, rather make kind sacrifice positive change. That's patently false.

I specifically questioning OP's presentation Florida's data believe misleading. Hello fellow asthmatic. Every inhaler prescribed pricey, even GoodRX coupon promotion, it’s $200. grab OTC one CVS $25. course that’s using, cuz lungs past point affordable inhalers, pinch keeps dying. wanted let know OTC one slim chance could help. take 13 fucking days get result? got mine one day. Measles almost eradicated antivaxers ensured would never happen. Coronavirus going anywhere, along polio, TB, whooping cough, flu....  Shocking country absolutely fucked healthcare system struggling health crisis. Dead end alley would work. pronounced looks. Cali rent state 4 months prepare, including getting testing supplies.

If prepared, malicious, they're ones make sure state supplies need. live 16 people, hell even quarantine? That's also bit meaningless epidemiologically since people without neutralizing antibodies still contract again, get sick again, spread it. T-cell immunity immunity sense general public employs word. noticed one committed troll post. 

You absolutely bigger moron idiot infected people. 

By way, sheep following idiots minimizing global pandemic.

I going block won’t deal nonsense. Honestly? Yeah. I've brushed homelessness several times last year, still can't imagine withholding something like this. thought even occurred me.

How even expecting hide it? house 16 people, odds someone going symptomatic. Withholding something like housemates *worst* thing worried homeless. assuming one January cov2? actually get tested back then?  first requirements test required lot hoops jump mild friend likely gone trouble try get test imagine. People often forget California Republicans sets three ""red"" states.   honest sound pretty awesome.  1/3 cup bleach 1 gallon water best friend I'm arguing facts. I'm using numbers based New York studies things got BAD. Plus treatment outcomes better numbers actually pessimistic. 

Of course tragedy stop letting emotions overrule thinking. agree finally got right. 

*Nice job absolute bare minimum telling people wear masks months became accepted standard, President Trump!*

Now let’s vote fucker November. I've said repeatedly myself, responsible parent would send kid school usual raging. means they're year older expected graduate high school, it, they'll live. 

But it'd preferable safe way ensure kids get educational needs met pandemic quickly decisively implemented Nationwide support coordination Federal Government. yeah, ain't happening anytime soon Government thinks Constition begins ""You, People"". may right. Unless maybe thought might wind street (with kids eleven hers) find out? 

I actually find particular action damn near indefensible, many thread attacking her... deserves benefit doubt deserves judged anyone unfamiliar circumstances. headline says hospitals ""overwhelmed"".

The text says Brazil struggling cope influx coronavirus patients,

Struggling cope, ""coping"".

And nothing actual text says people dying cannot get treated. would think case, would maybe mentioned article.

It's another example clickbait headline, accurately reflect contents article. seems like drug helped people Covid, universally. Like many drugs, guarantee even work people, may bring enormous improvement others. keep we've continue study it. Wait, response led preening narcissist attention span goldfish done worse response led Ph.D. Chemist? Really? shocker!

""Many hospitals also shared data federal website map supply chain needs relative facilities "" Federal? strange word?

""Many Germans agreed Merkel, whether support politics not, right brand leadership pandemic. scientist training, Merkel provided data-driven updates public **deferred wherever possible expertise herself**."" germans crazy! Noone noes moar ME!

""many Germans pride extremely fact based cautious "" FREEDUM? Facts? Huh? I'm confused. meant alarm people.

Spraying food chemicals bleach possibly harmful.

We can't eradicate completely. way so. things can't spray Lysol bleach. Vegetables instance could absorb chemicals. seep coverings meats, cheeses, plastic wrapped food items.

UV probably safest alternative disinfect. simple. side spews nonsense, ""apologists"" come trying set record straight. Tegnell never said thinks hopes Norway fare badly come autumn. Instead hypothesized Sweden might slightly easier time considering apparently sustainable effective measures place well higher level immunity (not enough herd immunity, enough beneficial effects) population. flip side, Norway might need enforce stricter measures, likely inconvenience anything else. None seems suggest thinks Sweden better way.

Discussion important, think Sweden done great job, discussions must good faith. one side spins one way, must spin opposite way. result there's ton shit flinging benefit. never understood... people can't understand entire point dealing Covid... defend can't defend themselves... Like protecting perfectly healthy may get fine (though studies show may case)... protecting may complications... protecting elderly... Protecting underlying health conditions... Great people long lasting affects Covid... that's fucking point... 87k them? federal leadership incompetent ineffective implement something magnitude nationwide. Mr Hankey ""Hi de ho!!"" Almost certainly: combination factors nobody really wants completely acknowledge. nation clear history systemic racism involved tying race poverty. Lacking social systems involved tying poverty worse education (including nutrition), less access healthy food, less access healthcare, turn helped create culture go doctor emergency vs. approaching health ongoing lifestyle.

On top that, heritable factors probably involved. Plenty diseases impact racial groups others, even know why. genetic, explain it.

Kawasaki disease often comparison made MIS-C (a dangerous complication children previously COVID19). Kawasaki disease also seems heritable component - tends ""run family"" even always clean-cut parent child. Whatever component is, result frequency different different ethnic groups.

For example, study points Even residing West, East Asian children 10 20 times likely develop KD. worth while. Give electric chair go work needed money? Largely asymptomatic always probable outcome. getting best possible medical care afforded president, too. Oh yeah really get downvoted that?

Yes. Multiple times (one like -50), every similar comment downvoted well. care community telling people suck up. delivery, curbside, call ahead also available people want around people without masks well right? great options i'm glad giving people options see harm allowing face shields lieu masks feel like can't breath mask panic attacks. people want go someplace allows masks shields use options pointed out.

The thing people stuck ways realizing double standards. Everyone saying options options ""pro-mask time"" people use feel safe going store.I honestly understand pushback much possible make everyone comfortable? ok someone say can't wear mask use online ok saying like peolpe wearing mask use online?  even put little ""motivations"" wrappers lozenge. Things like ""get back champ"", ""power through"", ""buckle push forth"". 

So basically encouraging customers go work sick. Even regular times pass flu bug coworker immunocompromised relative/child home could go suffer even die.

This reprehensible corporate behavior. Miami alone beaten every county 14 day increase, 40k+ new cases last two weeks. LA county 45k.  


Miami : crazy numbers. Bolsovid-19 Right... Good point. Single use PortaJohns? keep hearing possibility, yet nothing proven conclusive even many people. 

So far theory coming fear-porn articles unless solid source? China's fault

You kidding right? Look, like Trump much next guy bid put blame Trump seem forgotten CCP did. censored Taiwanese reports could confined Virus within China. Instead advising world seriousness disease early on, government wad busy trying surpress facts. saying China's fault. Give fucking break. Another facet I'm seeing people gloss over: child gets sick?
Your child, you, family quarantine home anyways.

Not hoard people totally going ignore quarantine... poor things quite grasp cause effect, challenging world live in. 

It's challenging though. know know. case already one. right, dependent afford do. point is, might need get creative, would want knowledge least attempt protect myself. Even afford strap mask face home splash bleach counters that's would knew living someone Covid. Cali twice population. easily say something hasn’t proven wrong right, even right, get downvoted lot.

“Guys don’t think let 12 year olds go hormones transgender” - someone 10,000 negative karma. never even see anyone opposing viewpoint here. Ok punishable crime. trip Europe around June-July cancelled. Now, there's hope nation idiots. still, Trump done past 3.5 years, still ""need info"", there's really nothing discuss. That's joke. clean glass drinking water needed cure everything wrong Africa?

Half Africans would still die.

We're also running glass vials vaccine kits. exactly plan vaccinate everyone? charged attempted murder. I've couple great shoppers texted pictures items replacing, guide right spot (like, favorite honey fancy cheese, rest honey). right, like majority never store before, even themselves.

I'm thankful continue avoid stores, though. realllllly gotta ask question...

&amp;#x200B;

With Florida falsifying 90 percent cases, know even close truth? saying wrong, cases USA inflated, number would incredibly off. I’ve got real bad feeling one narcissistic woman work with...

Husband works hospital she’s fucking dumb wear mask correctly. went home day unusual symptoms “something” don’t know yet. Criminal. thought NY one nursing home issues? maternal grandmother 13 kids paternal grandma 9. I’ve small army cousins. imagine testing 1000 people, neighborhood 5% people COVID. means sample, 50 people true positives, 950 people true negatives. test PCR test that's 98% sensitive 98% specific, end 50\*.98= 49 people COVID positive test result, plus one falsely negative person. bad, really. Among truly negative people though, 950\*.98 =931 people dont COVID 19 people truly infected received positive test result. 68 people positive test, 72% truly positive.

&amp;#x200B;

but shit wait 2 weeks results.

&amp;#x200B;

spit testing much faster.. go 2/3 something like that.. 

check MLBs testing protocol.

if high temp, go home. leave park. 

if turns went home reason, it.

false positives acceptable name game paranoid, take action 100.4F 

&amp;#x200B;

why bother getting swabbed need wait longer incubation period get results?.. 

""hello - yes.. apparently sick.. hope stayed home whole time""

&amp;#x200B;

They got tested coronavirus. Now, wait. Growing delays put lives D.C., Virginia Maryland, patients told tests would take days waiting **two weeks longer get results**, erasing chance meaningful contact tracing leaving limbo. difference make?

Why use intentionally inflammatory language try distract blatant failings federal government.

That vast, vast majority suffering U.S. right blanket refusal federal level respond early days insistence real problem.

If going name things source means need call Trump Depression cause Trump outbreaks china virus. American's dont think government going let die, better think again. many bathrooms? way look ""excess morbidity"" i.e. deaths significantly average. would account cases misdiagnosed, undiagnosed, indirect causes.  Max level Karen rest world urges deaths... USA least buy amount could let countries buy some... least emergency cases. Jail!!! Wait live many people? lol  Probably unfortunate. Elections consequences. oppose many actions elected officials suffer same. What?

Are saying people living certain towns can’t impoverished?

Do think every t-shirt shop gas station college classroom filled wealthy people?

You idea talking agree, another poster mentioned above, think could PR move say “See? big deal.” Please ban Karens sport would love options doubtful happen lifetime US :( wouldn’t say economy depends it, fact hurt economy past, like housing bubble. Several sectors stand make lot money short term overextension, encourage it. 

The argument “Americans far poor people realize” yeah, it’s relevant. wouldn’t consider someone living nice house bunch toys vacations poor they’re living paycheck paycheck. American way lol

Independent fault. guy? Age city matches Basically everything. I’m disagreeing that. I’m simply saying individual level, single person “extremely high” chance dying COVID-19.  Remove snark literally vaccines pharmaceuticals sold.  America =/= humanity thank much. think try see Right!? cares 80 85 year old could still potentially lived another 10+ years enjoying life kids, grandkids maybe even great grandkids. Sharing laughs, hugs creating family memories. care would died soon enough anyways... I’ve literally taken mask since pandemic started except sleep, shower, eat. guy pathetic. Oh yeah really get downvoted that? surely made snarky comment US never actually locked down, like even close, didnt get downvoted all.

If look numbers ""first wave"" never ended, slowed little thats ""reopened"". 

The area thats locked sort NY imo.

Edit: remember sub brigaded anti-maskers anti-lockdown folks couple weeks ago though. problem phrases like ""very few"" ""a lot"" ""spike"".

Currently number positive cases US 1.2% population. people think lot, others don't. 10x would 12%. thing, people think that's lot others don't.

They eventually estimated 20% world's population got Swine Flu. really see reason virus wide spread. Nah, worthless selfish bastards want wealth power. Wealth doesnt make selfish cunt, already. sort stupid headline this? COURSE still he's testing positive Agree yuuuge push “open economy” aren’t necessary? That's surprising, considering look solely LA surrounding counties - they've almost 100k new cases last 14 weeks alone.  


LA County : Honestly doesn’t seem bad. $39 2 doses treatment cycle seems fair. Especially since isn’t explained looking cost goods. amount development vaccine also infrastructure manufacturing massive. They’ll able use older tech since mRNA vaccine never produced definitely plenty changes, especially throughput. That’s interesting hope result M4A I’m seeing answer question. Lead time bias account week two extra time infection death, nonetheless death rate fraction growing quickly before.

So numbers worse before? Insanity 

Totally nonessential 

People problem Shut state 2 weeks.   hard that? anyone miss fact Dr. Sin Hang Lee currently/was legal battle CDC claims CDC ""deprived"" $57 million dollars? Also, sample size based 10 samples abstract, I'm R&amp;D, classified low representative section able scale sorts numbers population size?  apparently victim covid weather died it’s reported covid death. lady died car wreck last week town reported covid death. Brother coroner city.  Nah, ""Evil"" faster. forget death rate factor. 

&amp;#x200B;

The virus right fucks ups survivors. Life long complications. “We’ve tried nothing we’re ideas!” virus catch yesterday. takes 24 hours infection symptoms appearing. take two weeks symptoms get all. Living house 16?? Yeah inevitable sorry. certain percentage spooked millennials going permanent anxiety this.

FFS dude, get him. SOB, even it, hanging him. link found cursory google search. article linked also mentions bioterrorism reason. People still gonna think hoax. much misinformation top early on. recall vaccine read recommend taking acetaminophen every 4 hours 2 days? can't that. blood pressure would drop point would pass never wake up.  watched counties, numbers increased turned hospital covid wings. percentages good way gauge. want see many patients admitted compared month month. According another thread, hospitalizations time high Oh sure, correct! Denmark advising pro face masks political decision end detour right away. Holyshitovir. explain told none people lives with. Insane jump previous record circa 700 believe. course population counts 1/5th worlds population compared countries still much. type vaccine quick turnaround flu shots nothing like flu shot. There's way pivot flu Covid. vaccines use different approaches (which good, ups odds good one) lot approaches totally novel. old candidates Sars/Mers retooled analogy fit. like pivoting apple pie chocolate ice cream. much worse that. guarantee people immune months. wish could comment shared cause dangers without breaking sub's ""no politics"" rule. Wishing magical thinking. live Harry Potter universe wishes come true sometimes? /s Don’t worry it, idiot threads dumbass new account. likely troll already banned once. Entitled little fucker, isn’t he? RemindMe! 21 days.

Want make bet? place bet hope, life, optimism, science. you? damn millennials wanting real food, wanting breathe poison smoke, wanting stuff made things give cancer! end! Next want super rich pay proportional tax normal people coloured folks treated equally!It stop! wish people dead?

Let's start easy one: Hitler. wished dead? Realize not, basically wished dead millions others.

After realize ok wish people dead, start discussing deserves doesn't.

But basically anyone directly intentionally responsible innocent person getting killed, ok wished dead. Stalin, Pol Pot, Mao, Putin, Duterte, Erdogan, Bolsonaro, Trump. yes, Bush, Obama fair game, too. We've 40% population anti-vaxxers, anti-masks, believe 5G Bill Gates injecting chips. skepticals make easier everyone wanted get dose get one. think places US Yeah healthy helps immune system..

But introducing broken versions virus build fuckin immunity lol  I'm sorry loss. lost father weeks ago due too. family grieve suffer living new normal rest lives maybe comfort knowing passing least ended suffering may lived healthy life post-recovery case dad. Wishing best, stay strong. Exactly. worst always there... marginilzed relatively silent. Trump gave voice. Even Howard Stern rightly points out... would hate followers ever meet them. says ""no politics"" buuut... say ""no economics""... 🤔 Wicked smart definitely safely managed virus Germany. attack Trump! /s Yeah, you’re exactly right. Unfortunately many people don’t care others. That’s becoming clear this. It’s scary. someone actually severe persistent anxiety disorders I'd like say, fuck whole paragraph, complete asshole. telling chief executive office power whatsoever influence federal agency who's commissioner appointed office? 

Interesting. Oh please, condescendingly wrong me. bit mentally regressive, admittedly somewhat funny. 

Stupid hell, though. creativity.

Definitely okay pushing failures China. Depends read.   

The articles said Sweden badly neighbors data (unemployment, consumer spending), article said better based *projections* GDP, I'm inclined trust first article actually see GDP. yeah doesn’t mean they’re susceptible reinfection. they’re immune system still better prepared fight virus actually infects them. unless they’re exposed high viral load cough sneeze.

doctors said months away knowing reinfections possible, it’s like said, virus went dormant re-emerged.


Certainly, antibodies one component immune response virus, albeit important one. like pants. longer doesn’t necessarily mean left completely exposed, especially happen wearing Spanx underneath. kind immunity virus may remain even don’t detectable antibodies blood. checking antibodies blood serum currently easiest way measure level protection may have.


Is case similar cases actually cases re-infection? represent situations false negative test results occurred positive test results? cases, seems like two separate infections could instead simply one really long infection. Also, chance person could positive test longer infected. test viral genetic material (i.e., RNA) could detecting fragments virus rather whole live defense, China *does* reputation going invisible time time I'm gonna look Facebook later get back home cant guarantee gonna there, rolled around facebook around April-may.

Edit: wasnt able find video, scouting probably taken now, bs happening related drug cartels wars president state saying disagrees president country videos I've finding now. Thinking people going vote liberal policies conservative policies based one party dealt coronavirus. think someone anti-abortion gives 2 fucks whether party likes masks? think liberals jump ship Cuomo botched New York Nursing Homes? 

&amp;#x200B;

Biggest lie America right ""your"" politicians best interest mind tow line respective parties. goes parties Counting total hospitalizations whole country lazy best, doesn’t help us observe patterns adapt.

Why? stop us counting things too. could always say data coarse. pay attention numbers Illinois Chicago? Chicago South Side? whole South Side 60623? 60623 Lawndale? come attention, burn 80 hours, isolate again, eligible unemployment isolating. That’s “high level” means... seem unfamiliar terminology Well, least know whether *had* time test gets back.

Ridiculous. sounds scary af considering I'm postive felt mostly fine like little confidence teachers able manage classrooms. What’s fucking human Plague Rats running amok society?

It’s enraging, seeing kind behavior.  bad viral load lungs.... either clean use.

LOL 

And serving food drinks? Lesnikowski pretty unusual name. Good detective work, sir. meanwhile philippines 77,000 cases president advising people reuse masks rinse gasoline...



and realizing covid number one problem :/ ignore everything said besides study, simply say ""well people mentioned flaws wrong"".

Wow dude, convinced me. OH WAIT DIDNT Thanks taking first half sentence forming response. could handled lot better months ago deaths cases fraction today. China shady stuff trying silence problem covering up, nobody's arguing that. zero leadership handle problem presidential administration standpoint. switched juul march, significantly lowered number cigs smoke week. Went pack half day heavy smoker 2 packs week. Trying completely eliminate super hard especially drink usually every weekend. It'll fapivar forever. I'd happy read obituary. guy killing thousands people brain-dead dick. Hmmm...no, don’t think many people would responsible enough test someone peer reviewed lot scientific papers grad school— doesn’t catch much would expect. don’t repeat experiments, read say data presented supports conclusions (and decide care enough good job). Often it’s put youngest/most inexperienced lab members. reviewing first year grad school didn’t know anything really was, prof slapped name sent out. It’s one million things researchers plates it’s unpaid thankless. Sucks, one million things academia needs change— unasked comment. Ahh finally  evidence suggests natural  ""yes, I've got it, big deal, carry on"" anecdote. individual's history tests taken, treatments undergone, symptoms experienced, etc., data point. though ;-p Lol, they're gonna distributing Oxford vaccine several months phase 3 ends. Oh raised American Midwest, I’m sorry misunderstood asking lol Ooooooohhh, know, actually even think that. I'm glad shared super understandable sometimes like weak headache thats it, least rn. Reported foul language. Lmao people teeny tiny intelligence think countries US suffering Pandemic well. whose fault that?? Even countries took precautions early still suffered thousands deaths . Shall blame Trump too?


In country Norway, 255 people dead. took precautions early still late 255 people died. China had, instead covering facts, warned world early massive fuckup made people many countries US would probably alive. obsessed US even think that. Well bad news, assuming US. failed lock properly first time, virus control states. two issues, virus spread economy, inextricably linked. economy *will not* return sense normalcy people afraid normal activities. way alleviate fear get virus control. 150 patients Phase 3... 

This Phase 2 best.  one thing worries originally approved US fetal abnormalities associated it.

That means may appropriate pregnant women women planning become pregnant.

That need bit attention Using data currently available us, two common outcomes survival overall 97% death 3%. don’t know much numbers fudged falsified. Hospitals get paid calling common cold COVID case. It’s interests fake numbers inflate cases deaths.  That's anti body test that's chargeable (£70 I've heard), test currently free thanks NHS educators. jailed least decade. mean going ""disappear?"" Multiple people stated cannot man-made virus that's hysterical bulshit. 

I know hard understand could evolve wild happen us since started domesticating animals. Anytime people close contact different species wild animals animals could sick chance transmission. Making bunch stupid racist statements China get us closer stopping food processing plants dangerous filthy there's guarantee you. lot comments saying vaccine priced reach average American. That's idiotic. I'm cynical US healthcare politics anyone, *this plague costing rich people money*.  want us go back working consuming. Farmers charge cattle upfront vaccination rinderpest, would penny wise pound foolish.

All vaccines diseases like measles *could potentially* cause expensive outbreak available free children, although people afford generally choose get doctor's office instead county health clinic. First time seeing video.. security took way long come this. least 3-4 mins showed up. think pay hospital bills end getting covid. die covid-19 go prison murder. ""free"". Americans pay $1.95 billion vaccine. think governments money comes from? called taxes. That's all. Americans payed advance vaccine may may work may may used. Remember italy thing police/military force everyone in? yes legitimate fears! illegitimate illogical fears! get yet? psychological condition prevents able wear mask, can't go fucking store! delivery curbside pickup require wear mask minute. emotional distress wearing mask even moment truly crippling get contactless delivery! solutions! solution not, ""jeez fellas heart masks make feel bad let whatever want"" flaws study ilk constantly cite laid bare. know talking about. Also LOL @ thinking there's magic substance spray everything kill viruses lasts half month. HAHAHAHA. site research this? say confidence? SARS eradicted  Apparently Baptist, least coworker, he's protected thru faith Exactly, it’s entirely subjective term. simply wouldn’t call 3% chance anything happening “extremely high” chance. Don’t worry, history books edited people won’t study this. vulnerable group exactly? people obesity? America that's 40% population. People 65? That's 15.2%. people immune diseases? That's 7%. Almost *half* America kind cardiovascular disease.

You say protect ""vulnerable 10%"" that's easy-to-select, mutually agreed-upon number. political / social fight gets vaccinated first going much political shitshow every part pandemic. Sociopath Bolsorona Governors begging someone else make decision take responsibility. 

They willing take action now, work together accept chance wrong. 

New York got coronavirus control first time took action. Donald trump didn’t anything slow coronavirus nyc still got slowed. 

Waiting next year bad move. time act now. disagree that. seeing congress /senate getting fight. state changing it, hot political topic states want touch. reason states medical exemption only. Even California large number doctors willing write medical exemption Absolute Chad I've worked two unions (albeit 2000s-2010s)

The teamsters fine. got good pay benefits, one time got injured work place swooped made sure management knew *exactly* fucked they'd tried make part situation fault problem. 

I also worked under, *think*, UFCW - can't remember since long ago, covering local independently owned grocery store. Anyway, literally nothing - never met union rep, made basically minimum wage, nepotism still rampant store, protections hours, workplace conditions, anything like that. Literally drain paycheck. 

I imagine view unions would different second experience vs first. California incredibly expensive. uncommon many families live one home. many people died flu last year? many pneumonia? many COVID19 past 4 months alone.

One like “The Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act (HIPAA) 1996 protects privacy health information. workplace, HIPAA ensures employee health information provided parties, employers, without consent community news must ""good news"" flair, make sure translate monkeys language One reasons NZ made short tight lock government dropped wait time requirements claiming unemployment provided wage subsidy employers people still got paid lockdown businesses fighting chance surviving downturn cash flow would result. 

They also increased benefits (some increases made permanent sneak some, all, overdue cost living increases would otherwise objected to) rescued homeless people streets (also intent make permanent). attitude ""this build surplus good times, prepare rainy day, definately rainy day"".

Things probably would gone badly NZ hadn't. lockdown succeed everyone board play part, everyone safety net necessity make sure happens. like spending dollar save ten. ensured economy would bounce back quickly lockdown ended.

The thing quite striking though businesses (even bigger ones well paid executives) also living hand mouth fall trouble hits, even rich people often fall trap living hand mouth spending limits income guarenteed forever (buy expensive house/car, eat restaurants, take overseas holidays, rather invest save).

In case, money government spent used attack (pre-election propaganda nasty subset conservatives opposition - yet ray hope lot decent intelligent conservative voters abandoned opposition planning voting keep current government in). test 3 times? value? say ""the number patients **seeking care** COVID-19 decreased significantly last week"" seems imply result increased selectivity admissions. I’m insider pharmaceutical manufacturing. basically making vaccine prior validation approval need capital front. risk, obviously, there’s anything found wrong validation manufacturing process prior FDA approval, cannot release batch. risk vaccine manufacturers making right though obvious reasons: $$$$  Depends count extremely high, think one would play russian roulette chances I'd say based comment pretty good handle things OP. Yeah real high level analysis bud "" dont think we'll get vaccine soon""

Youre pretty far ass lmao whole narrative long time kids less likely infected, less likely severe infections event they're infected, harder time passing disease others. always sounded like nonsense me, lot people really latched onto silver lining. No. Outside people wouldn’t worry it. live quiet block little traffic walk street cross street somebody coming towards side. Ofcourse mean eradicated, achieve level unobtainable without vaccine. took 40 years ""eradicate"" measles United States vaccine. Yet seeing outbreaks lately antivax jackasses. 

Measles lifelong immunity too, even know we're immune month, 3 months, 6 months year this. we're careful turn worldwide wack mole. Hes done nothing increase National Debt, anything ""saved"" went wall award loyalists. true. Double record flu season.... unmatched steps taken mitigate it....

What get purposefully trying mislead people lying data? Italian study breaks needing critical care age group well asymptomatic.

 

**Probability symptoms critical disease SARS-CoV-2 rain cause thunder? thunder cause rain? answer neither. One confuse correlation causation.

In case, Sweden's numbers rise quickly measures even fully implemented. Different measures change - faster implementation would. That's herd immunity. That's individual immunity. still provided example OP. Asian countries second waves, one disastrous unceasing wave. Thank much! super helpful. Oohhhh, last part really good.  I’m sure got upvoted got downvoted. hit nail head. Hell gonna run excavators dig mass graves rate personally consider fast food higher risk since workers often can't afford stay home even know they're sick exposed. I've seen reports people tested positive still came work personally know someone continued go work fast food job even multiple members household tested positive. Fast food worth risk spread area decline cases rare. dad retired ER doctor, Trump lover, can’t even bring talk COVID, know would utterly piss off. 
I try avoid talking Trump thing, anyway, great change me. 

But. Seriously. He’s fucking DOCTOR. 🤦🏻‍♀️ lol do, cut budget overall government, start paying back 26 trillion debt, keep government small don’t see what’s happening happen again. keep using graph proves point.

Last three months super downward trend. want freak slight uptick last month?

How waiting least another month see levels goes back outrage?

Please don’t invest, you’ll end capitalizing losses. mean? No, 30,000 US ChAdOx1 (aka AZD1222), Oxford vaccine.

The vaccine mentioned article Ad5-nCoV, vaccine CanSino running with. similar adenovirus vector vaccine. published phase 2 trial result Ad5-nCoV Lancet yesterday.

This vaccine trialled Brazil Sinovac, called ""CoronaVac"" inactivated virus vaccine. Millions work.. hundred thousand old people dead, cost ton money died. numbers help Medicare. cut projects could transferred competent agencies would receive state funding likes we've never seen, could invest welfare people lost jobs, could start production non military related things See, that's thing, couple months ago people saying we'd need least half million tests day US. anticipate virus surging many places once, experts assumes would learn NYC.  Touching. 

You would probably get shot US trying this. Press 3 days difference atm lol. JHU uses different data sources. Slightly different sources. think worldometer uses presumed cases states. Presumed also likely case aswell btw   There's always individuals groups immune one reason another, biology full exceptions every rule. certainly rely part ""strategy"" though. Oh sure think also aware information comes from, especially they’re highly disingenuous/conspiracy prone group. get point agree it, already see [tipping triggering like thawing permafrost melting ice arctic antarctic. happening **now**. events wait people become educated, damage irreversible self-accelerating then. NOBODY associated China big mouth did. There's even incorrect association Spanish Flu, origin unknown.

It's pointing fingers making others look bad, best.

I'm glad he's wearing mask hope continues so, totally brush simple thing long really immature displays lack moral fiber. Stating something he'll thousands citizens died, setting poor example everyone shameful.

His handling pure negligence. another one can't basic arithmetic let stop voicing 'opinion' internet.

2020-94 = 1926.

Let's forget, actually. get intentionally downplaying severity happening?

Seriously, cases skyrocketing, deaths following, doubling rate keeps roughly halving meaning uncontrolled exponential growth...

Serious question, suffering discalculia? thing would explain complete lack understanding numbers work fear data. sell dog cat masks? pay federal debt, use billion dollars per day interest payment something productive. Dude... even read... First freaking sentence. Please people.... ""A relationship infecting dose risk disease severity demonstrated COVID-19."" Total viral load infection something completely different... 33% population low. least 50% country complete idiots. Indeed. region state considered reasonably well compared rest country, 190 cases day (nearing 230ish). dream day US cases get 1k, even 20k, seems far fetched right now. I’m it. Hell let’s number. 

Problem is: 10% end lining pockets trumps cronies. government already spend money military defense? type crap already accounted for? remember 9/11 USA preparing biological type attack U.S. soil. Yet are, global pandemic, still game plan (even though knew coming months advance). apparently home defense went nothing. even public safety. ahead China enemies. Whoever control virus bounce back fastest leverage enemies. want this? Also, war someone released chemical weapon USA, mean masks supplies fight it? I’m sure government agrees this, would take money service members’ pay. literally said got deserves - said deserve that? 
Which it? tomorrow it’ll 1000.

It’s zigzag downwards straight curve. Quit cherry picking single days prove something downward trend prominent.

That’s friend, intention subjecting nonsense.

Have good day. Personally, think problem lies people educated enough make proper descisions, government forcing people wear masks. that’s opinion. Interesting numbers magically started improving areas right reporting change CDC White House.

edit: correct I'm wrong, areas starting triage people, they're sending old people sick people low survival chances home may die there. count ""hospitalizations,"" correct? another passage time again. Quit hyperbolic.

Makes laugh really. Huge steep curve downwards last three months, nada. Slight uptick month it’s end world? Jesus, take Xanax. Ya, sucks people dumb. saw bunch people idiots bar night turned around left. distancing, masks, nothing. seem close vaccine responsible little bit longer thousands lives saved. Well, bit pedantic, CA way *active cases* NY (per capita), turn lead deaths *assuming one else got infected.*

That said, difference deaths per capita drastic moves CA inch there's mile left go. observed barista hotel coffee shop blow nose serve person without washing hands (she donned one glove)

This shit right here, even COVID rarely ate out. food make cheaper, better quality, full control sanitary conditions kitchen. 

People tell need get more, stuff like mentioned \*shudders\* think would said something. think could peaking cycle. school starts back get things motion field, moving goalposts. like it? Keep small defense force must need offensive military 2020? Especially shit going right like climate change, poverty, healthcare, starvation, homelessness, underpaid teachers, private space companies overtaking national ones, prison reform, college, stuff would handled enough bank oligarchy go golfing while. perfect it'd start Yeah thanks. proper source: past weeks still inaccurate. Choose Florida example set ""Excess deaths without COVID-19"". see even without covid excess deaths already far normal time year.

Other countries also shown excess rate usually matches accurately recorded covid deaths little extra excess deaths caused lockdown changed schedules hospitals. Differences likely due lack reporting. people claiming Chinese people gullible see Chinese propaganda laid front them. post goes beyond scope sub average going think going fast, we've really light days terms deaths. 

The next days could prove wrong, though. thoughts fucking retarded portray jackass. Faaaaake newwss deep state got etc etc

You literally can't reason conspiracy idiots. dad one, stopped talking him. needs samples? Everyone it! 0.25%. You’re factor 10. NJ 0.18% entire population died. I’m saying it’s important. I’m saying can’t compare 9/11. Wish could lie tell know people like that. I'm almost 40. Take will.  pretty cool article; purdy pucker lips ""It's frum CHI-NUH- CHINA""  asked question Sweden magnitude higher daily death rate Nordic neighbours. What's that? old people, cares? 

/s Thanks , Panama city matter died, old.

Never mind previously living fine contracted covid

Also going spout nonsense, back source. estimated 28 million actually everyone would bet large percentage. Young people die make news seems like it’s bigger is. makes even sickening people dismiss hoax try politicise :( actual Nazis charge concentration camps China moment.

Here's AMA's press release FDA AMA plenty good want hear sides story, make mind? Well survival usually takes precedence luxury. Education, healthcare social security need people use it. overvaluing human life? Yea even close, herd immunity implies herd protected.

Yes. herd protected protection absolute. Herd immunity occurs roughly proportion number individuals immune.

See Herd immunity occurs large portion community (the herd) becomes immune disease, making spread disease person person unlikely. result, whole community becomes protected — immune.

Note says spread person person becomes unlikely. absolute. occurs range. 140,000 bodies later... #ThanksTrump tend disagree this. many variables can’t account (community spread sitting bar hours vs community spread quick liquor store run; multi-person household families coexist vs spend day together, etc) think trying make blanket statement demographics would inherently flawed. mention, it’s always easy pinpoint infection actually took place. India sure accurate 15% population exposed (I think probably meant reply someone’s comment.) seems civil war basically became cold civil war racist traitors infected law enforcement kept perpetuating things guise ‘law order’ ... politician utters words it’s basically admitting r fascist  Importantly, demonstration MBC induction SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests durable form B cell immunity maintained even circulating antibody levels wane. low pay means minimal reserve fund. Yes, market practices unsanitary, cultural thing needs rectified greater good humanity. China's fault happening country right Eh. clear new infections risen nearly *10x* deaths flatlined ~100 per day (so roughly 2-3x small number). Compare shitshows saw New York (where ~800 people died daily similar new daily infections) 

If asked guess happens next month would’ve told expect *some* increase deaths, hardly par hysterical non-math majors expected. Low behold, Florida hasn’t turned morgue. 

Also note Florida’s new cases deaths haven’t changed much week. happened exponential growth? 3 people supposed infect 3 infect 3 everyone dies according geniuses sub. Golly gee happened lol? Yes, serious. first 100K people died. Quick, need get message end country immediately! Saddle horse! Facepalm

The headline paper misleading. look titre rate look pretty stable me.
We know couple studies antibody titres rise (more slowly mild asymptomatic cases), plateau drop least 50 day mark overall titres remain stable (95%) 75 day mark. normal common cold coronaviruses, SARS-COV-1 MERS know IgG drop stepper common cold coronaviruses titres return baseline 4 month - 1 year mark 1-3 years SARS-COV-1 MERS.
The paper's suggestion 73 day half life suspect papers longer follow-up periods show strong stability 90 day mark. possible could drop strong evidence support see paper provide any.

Meanwhile Chinese people quite amazed Trump running US ground, benefiting China process.  Every developed country handled well.

But say care anyone else.

Are irony-proof? agree you.  better late never.  Yes, frustrated angry political leadership, think be.  again, better right thing late never all.  Hopefully, say, new stance masks save lives.  

In big picture, political engagement right showing people wrong.  like see war.  prefer think striving best possible outcome, best possible methods.  think normal disappointed people stupidity recklessness malevolence, think supportive people turn away things - people eventually try better.

In case, likely orange one changing tune purely selfish reasons, saves lives, I'm still glad it. Well firstly study determine percent severe, that's literature search. mathematical model based people's data OPs title wrong. Also present probability value .01 means 1% would potentially line NY data assume much higher documented infection rate point modeling shows. vaccine things like dengue either, world continues run fine. countries seem adapted covid now, lack vaccine big deal. seems like dumb study me, live alone worked well 2016. 10%? 

Could *far* more? then, if/when Coronavirus dealt reinvest schools, health care, welfare, housing, mental health, child care, food aid, water Flint, college, global climate crisis, giving every unhoused dog &amp; cat pet hug, making sure trillionaires, billionaires, millionaires pay taxes everyone else...

So answer question, either suppose actually article Orlando Sentinel saying exact opposite. Someone died motorcycle accident originally classified covid death tested positive. I’d go look article, reached article limit month. 

Mind you, exception rule. course people Covid die due completely unrelated circumstances, instances far between. 

There’s evidence suggest Covid deaths reported something else. *is* evidence we’re missing cases people dying. see looking excess deaths. we’re testing 20% positive, means we’re testing enough many people go undetected. thing deliberately changing cause death make governor look better. isn’t anything make DeSatan look better. see it’s shit show epic proportions.

Again.

Sad. sad. biggest worry M4A. government deciding reimbursements payer, might well give healthcare budget make government service. look happens basically every public service America. Public schools, public transit, public housing, etc... programs work well, government neglects public sector large voting population want see tax hikes reason. already see regular neglect programs like Medicaid. mean fuck's sake children's healthcare fund it. Even great idea theory, can't envision America maintains mean lean healthcare system. VA great example. *could* work, America... doesn't.

Pretty much departments see high levels funding consistently military police, one federal local. clear levels American politics nothing gets adequate funding unless there's oil involved politicians getting greased lobbyists. 

It feels like *this* government probably one want trust health yet. feel we've shifted left enough guys like Biden true conservatives, *then* we'll able go broke big social programs. keep government hands instead pass big subsidies can't revoked get everyone insured. covid wipes projected census gains Well lie, don’t want 10% 

I’d good 50% hope enough hospital beds medical staff this. literally don’t even seem care themselves. “If get it, get it!” Even Covid bad, long ass cold, would think narcissistic people would want avoid it, apparently not. Corona viruses typically mutate quickly significantly, combined need mutate, unlikely it'll change significantly.  Can’t believe stage pandemic, people like still manage downplay severity ignorant selfish manner. antibody rate indicates even worst hit areas less quarter people infected, puts CFR nearly 1 percent, rate rate severe symptoms claimed Well settles it, bar go. 

/s Yeah, take 10% budget annually/every year following:

\- Take 3% (or $20.58 Billion) annual US Military budget invest hospitals/medical care update medical system nationwide

\- Take 2% (or $13.72 Billion) invest K-12 school systems nationwide

\- Take 3% (or $20.58 Billion) invest infrastructure upgrades water, utility, roads bridges

\- Take 2% (or $13.72 Billion) ensure every child poverty US (15 - 20 M) gets breakfast every day 

How much would things improve 3-5 years? many jobs would provide? People confusing herd immunity herd “resistance” (still herd immunity think differentiated). I’ve seen lot scientists say 20% enough slow spread enough cases decline, don’t worry hospitals overrun. would also explain seeing New York Sweden. think Republicans fighting tooth nail block stuff like this. people experience programs better spending tax dollars, there’s going back. ACA fought long, people general pretty happy it, despite flaws. right, absolutely plain. would go far say using defense funds choice could made USA leader coronavirus recovery beginning, reason huge defense budget is. least they'll buried precious 'Face Rights' intact... straight ratio, percentage. misleading almost always sub express figures percentages. .01 1%. I'm r/raisedbynarcissists confirm narc anti-masker. South Korean epidemiologists found people likely contract new coronavirus members households contacts outside home.

Deaths lagging indicator, I'm afraid situation going get worse see improvement.


They opened soon need go back lockdown People loveee use percentages numbers small. would 50% increase, would 10% increase yet 50 deaths. See flaw perspective?

The media didn’t cover deaths per day falling 2.2k highs sub-1000. doesn’t generate clicks apparently doesn’t sell panic porn.

I don’t care media asks president, they’re bunch talking heads. Look data. That’s reality, Jim Acosta gang want peddle.

We’re 70% peak, that’s awesome. Sure it’s coming little let’s see next month. can’t ignore 3 months steep decline freak 1 month worth slight uptick.

If China warned us 2 weeks earlier, could use 2 weeks build testing! deaths lag cases. Deaths got infected like 2-4 weeks ago I'd say. also slight reporting delay weekend(hence weekend death tolls much lower). doubt backlogged whole week. Maybe Found narcissist. Let guess, years training something completely unrelated psychology means know psychologists. Doubtful. Per day deaths best looked 7 day rolling average account day day reporting fluctuations. last 16 days we’ve gone low 516 per day today’s 7 day rolling average 829. rate it’s two months away.

According census data, 32% population 50 older, seems line up.

That said, worth pointing 19% population 15 younger. People keep saying kids less likely get (which total nonsense whatever), we're discovering proportionately fewer cases among children (for whatever reason) logical extension would we're discovering proportionately *more* cases among 15-49 folks.

It would easier look case demographics.

If go state see 18-49 age group makes whopping 60.2% cases.

Going back census data, see 23.2% state less 18 years old, 18-49 age group makes 45% population 60.2% cases. best laid plans mice men often go awry.

The worst thing proof everything changed better, government corruption people afraid change refuse. Stock symbol: CCP employe got sick would sue based damage unsafe working conditions Plus lag, especially younger patients. take much longer time die COVID. impact contagion - virus spread easily school anywhere else! Good advice, u/Cat-penis read it, doubt didn't. fair, technically measles.

So many people got it, really became childhood disease. However, extremely infectious, kinda guaranteed get child, sucked.

The vaccine stopped cycle could use RNC instead ""more people die [car accidents/cancer/starving Africa/meteor impacts/alien abductions] every year, what's big deal??"" ""It's [old/young/fat/black/lizard] people anyway!!""

Is ANYTHING caused 750 deaths per day blue like virus? surely can't think anything.

This PREVENTABLE. Look Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam see could've happened real public health effort. Testing 7 day testing average peak. I'm trying combative right now. need stress life. good day. it’s photo op. That’s stupid. jobs. Nobody going die going Disney. Learn read. indoor gathering avoided. We've already got tropical depression Atlantic they're eyeballing system gulf... Send help (of course do, there's long term effects EVERY.SINGLE.VIRUS.ON.THE.PLANET

This true. mean can't even catch viruses earth much less long term effects virus.

Also many viruses reservoir species get sick virus, often bats, many organisms virus bad effects long term.

Hell, going back humans, catch colds time without much way long term effects.

The point going pedant, make basic errors.

or put another way:

Got source claim? Seems optimistic. give 12-18 hours retweets bullshit masks dangerous breathe CO2 whatever current nonsense  thought 2020 get worse, reddit finds u/vistavick embarrassed. Illustrating matter perceived threat, we’ve never decided shutdown public education. They're still saying deaths down. posting data CDC lagged death. mean weeks ago said nobody knows number 19 name.

p.s. mean you, mean lying bastards UK government.  typically covered insurance medicaid, large city live in, many free testing sites throughout city. may everyone's experience entire country however.   many states maxing testing every day though? much. Also, what's backlog results? states taking 10 days result, we're looking backwards time. like adults shitting young kid anything doing. disgusting. ask adults what's disgusting behavior, ""I get saying like way saying me"". adults saying this. young girl making adults act like immature kids. shameful seem self awareness embarrassing being.

Are tangible corollary aspects, sure? 

Is damned defined explain it? Hardly? 

God people look argue anything angle try feel “right”. 

You’re damn fool. Literally surprises one. Found someone doesn’t actually pay attention events. may wrong think US intelligence China knew chinese officials casinos *are* open.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  kind mask? cloth upper hem void there's nose strip, fix:

1. Buy stiff strips, like these: Buy make ear protectors tighter fit bonus less ear strain
3. Made slit void area, sewing/stitch line, near sides/ear loops area
4. Shimmied old flimsy twist tie one out
5. Shimmied 3x strips actually spanned entire length upper mask, overlapping pattern nose one sits top ends two/i.e. away face: \_\_---\_\_
6. Fiddle getting bend pattern good fit

The better nose wires + ear savers worked pretty well solve problem Caveats: use/duration somewhat limited I'm mostly home thankfully good rubber mask use longer stints/higher risk situations.

&amp;#x200B;

I also read people discussing using soap rubs, various anti-fog chemicals, using surgical tape hold mask down. also wanted exhales blowing eyes want fiddle tape could avoid it. think, 1 person like 7-9 months ago. could teach them, wouldn’t sending school.

And rest kids elementary school. didn’t learn anything. that’s exponential growth judgement 150,000,000 based reported actions 1?

There's shitty reasoning everywhere. I'm pretty sure Trump must told early somehow today look really, really bad things really heating terms people receiving end-of-life care (not mention ants crawling sick people Texas field hospitals)... Soooo planned press conference today show nation he's willing bare minimum here, more, also maybe less anymore.. It’s worse 9/11 Wtf Cali Unfortunately never know right call. worked retail, I'd quitting. Worked retail years corporations care employees safety best times! Proooove get fuck out. Sounds like church. There’s much like tbh Jokes you, mines even long. God! They've trained baboon speak! Put stocks let everyone spit him. call china virus... I'm NYC. *didn't* lock right away, *did* lot deaths! awful. Imagine like three straight weeks nobody outside, cars, people, city sounds all... except sirens. sirens hours. eeriest fucking thing.

But no, we're bunch weak amoral liberal antifa LGBT race traitors whatever, deserved guess?

We warning rest US take seriously, half country eyes shut hands ears. busy shouting shitty leadership much deserved pain notice virus growing unchecked communities. tied pride identities *not* taking steps delay mitigate spread, *we* forced take steps pathologically committed opposite whatever do. prepare. late. believe thing vaccine coronavirus? basing solely fact one before, actual theoretical justification? know vaccines even work? Remember it’s “new cases” “total cases”

Still bad Exponential growth assumes infinite population. finite population, believe growth would fit sigmoid curve. pretty unlikely we'll reach point things naturally slow due population limit, people react crisis slow spread (even want to, point disastrous ignore). Oh care alright. They’re clever catch pleb virus. Hmm that’s plausible. makes worried things isn’t reading every network days? wild act like overwhelmed. Americans travel turkey Tanzania right now. one else let us Yeah, POTUS despite majority people voted voting him. We're protesting police brutalizing kidnapping citizens. system stacked us voting protesting nothing. I'm honestly worried lead revolution. country still relatively young. wonder we'll survive this? boss made clear everyone symptoms waiting test result supposed stay home till results clear. Results finished 1-2 days however. Moscow Times article reporting Bloomberg assume anywhere go people it, stay fuck away anyone. 

I feel you, work hotel receptionist even though entrance sign says guest wear mask, people give fuck. Whe drawn line infront reception desk guest stay behind chech check out, everyone give damn. people cross line without wearing mask, lean reception tell follow rules get irritated. 100% sure i've contact someone virus go work every day fear. pleasant experience yesterday threatened company's owner transition remote work back office one social distancing wearing masks. claimed that, executive orders laws, anything right to. bringing high-risk family can't afford infect met ""everyone's going get eventually, might well happen now"", evidently believe masks anything first place.

It's disgusting we've come point. definitely need baked-in set laws protections cover future pandemic responses. Slim, isolate regardless stopped hating ""other people"" would realize much hate themselves. can't. Wtf CARES act ensure compensation anyone misses work they're waiting test results regardless results eventually receive. 

Can contest antibody test? ~~retarded~~ insane need positive result test 20%+ false negative rate ensure get sick leave, especially symptomatic. Creates wrong incentive structures. Companies denying paid sick leave people position going suffer outbreaks...

Edit: word. Also, I've learned people isolating pending test results eligible unemployment course self-isolation. government actually something right sound it, naturally neglected tell anyone... whole test pointless?
Because people work anyway, little point testing them. mandatory sick leave look like countries?

This year stuck there, probably football TV, excuse leave early, watching extended family wear masks noses cough hands pass turkey. way make without flipping out. feel well. I’m terrified virus family feed. It’s risk I’m really taking far going out. work pretty hard sanitize go in/out, touch face, stay away people, go inconvenient times there’s low foot traffic, limit trips every two weeks so.

No, you’re getting flu „a day less“ every single year.

hopefully someone goes back makes secondary primary cause death given overwhelmed system going be, dubious Same. Sorry. That’s gotta break kind fire code Would pretty boring purge, 99%+ people survive.  way we're handling this..your assumption likely correct depending location. Thats crazy. US Healthcare System overwhelmed. decided want test. Called doc ""sure, want come today tomorrow? come till 11 Clock get result next day 8 Clock"" worked like charm. Yes! Ranked voting win! need ranked voting. fire marshal would shut down, justifiably. thought joke couple months ago, seems like plan. reduced HIV CA felony misdemeanor. problem people would get tested legal deniability. could see something like happening Covid too. people going jail quarantining properly, they'd stop getting tested could say know sick. currently holding bimonthly sumo tourament tokyo even let spectators Everyone who's met knows true  Different countries, unfortunately. MI, we're UK. Technically could visit quarantined whole stay, high risk enough want expose flight (and us flying, four us including one year old, seems way out). I'm sorry, nobody mentioning, previous 2 days 4xx 5xx people died? deaths suddenly spike, still weekend.

Deaths relatively stable past weeks, despite rising cases. wait 13 days positive results well. quarantined whole 14 anyways even though symptoms 11 days. Every state own. Testing paradox here.

I live impoverished county northern California almost testing. partnered testing Co Verily created Project Baseline.

Baseline makes appointments took 20 minutes get tested free. Negative results back three days.

Verily works lot areas -- might worth looking into

Behaviour bad California. I'm hiding couch type this. Never estimate stupid. It’s powerful drug!  Frequently. Wanna get scared? EMTs private services make 9-10 bucks hour area live. Guess drives people dialysis appointments nursing homes? That's right, people barely making enough get likely health insurance one company 3 operates city even offers it.

America  guys decide healthcare best whole world US large widespread work. Aristotle - “It mark educated mind able entertain thought without accepting it.”

Is psychological cost wearing mask? sending signal people afraid? 

Individuals mimic behaviour around - crowd psychology - person it, need too. person buying toilet paper, need buy too.

If reached conclusion fear response disproportionate danger, reject wearing mask natural conclusion. Perhaps ""mask rejectors"" think people around kindness signalling - ""you afraid"" say entire post looking going work (probably fear losing job) covid positive. living situation touched privilege choice financial stability. wait Boris sells NHS US corporations, we'll understand bad US system is. Trump sent God vessel! wife’s relatives tell me. That’s longest I’ve ever heard take anyone. go get test done? Dumb question. contract contact tracing? I've seen versions stories. much pay read message? doesn’t sound like him. lady absolutely charged irresponsible. love cedar point  16 people household?? started showing symptoms two days ago. getting tested Friday, earliest could get appointment. work still expects come in.... live Iowa, anybody direct official document stating proper protocol? I’m social work considered “essential”.... feel dumb even typing but... yeah I’m going work also trying lose job. work places handling horrendously. 

At work, even much minor sore throat runny nose, allowed come work test negative. instructed work home feel alright enough it, job can't done remote - get paid sick leave. 

If test positive covid, get much paid sick time need (and come sick day bank already get every year) get two negative tests. (Again instructed work remote physically feel well enough it). 


AND pay medical bills significant medical care due covid. 

On top - remote abled employees remote *at least* labor day, said fully phase everyone pandemic (vaccine available herd immunity). Well, know -

*\[Launched chasm\]* different thing time, like religion, hair, supposed business sense, color. almost never politics. can't really turn phrase it? even make sense me.

I told wait year see panned extra year kids mean anything compared growing without mother (or mother permanent physical damage) none I'm Maine, one states well took 6 days get test results. employer though cover 80hrs though CARES act 32 hours missed come sick leave. Im denying rise either. texas didnt 200 new infections daily. way higher. also applies many things life. 

Just like idiots ruining everyone whether religious extremists making whole religion nation look bad play devil's advocate, also privilege issue? 

As in, knowing better relate poor education poor exposure much else? 

Because ""better"" typically costs money outside realm. Therefore someone never owned privilege essentially know better. even research afford know better.

Edit: Again, I'm opening discussion. onslaught downvotes. sued civil court  Hit refresh got tested 6th go work unless exhibited symptoms. didn’t get results today negative (YaaY), fact took 2.5 weeks get results ridiculous. could positive spread many people. Yesterday someone office brought USB disk. met street, us masks, took USB went back home. took like 4-5 seconds most, exchanged ""hello"", stand talk all. office doctor called told person felt sick afterwards tested today, results available tomorrow. chances got virus him, provided tests positive? I'm kind worried. I'm 35. 3 year old 6 year old. Husband always waffled 2 3 kids. wanted similar age gap second third, time act now.


So yeah, we're stopping 2. Sucks, lucky enough thusfar, need test fate. terrible tragedy whole family. everyone same, many flip flop along Trump. like logic behind reasoning. They're trying rationalize vote nutjob nutjobs either. employers US grant time without positive test result. Yup. Mostly people. It’s shame don’t level confidence facilities. America, didn’t get answer either way, would think lost sample. UK, part government's emergency legislation measures, Statutory Sick Pay paid day one sickness support affected COVID-19. employers pay lot basic. would get full pay six months needed would step stages next year so. Also, Government quickly put place furlough scheme step pay paid 80% workers' salaries, including self employed, avoid job losses. believe similar measures across Europe nations. Yeah learning new language also fun. learn culture borders open hopefully next years, maybe chance use it, vacation. I'm excited learn Korean might pursue time missed February March, government entered chat. Even true, good, information kept secret. there's good use spying shit, yeah, go get everyone's vaccine development info. ok one dumbfounded 16 ppl live house?? Stupid. Fucking. People. American living Europe (France), see dramatic contrast. Here, one income household fine 2 months quarantine. Companies choice ask offer employees take ""technical unemployment"" government would pay 80% salaries, amongst things. 

As know, unprecedented, aside history book black plague. came social management jobs. watched types ministers, health, interior, education, etc. etc. expected them, answered public. line regional, department, town mayors, charge micro management needed town town basis according decrees moment. 

Then there's US weeks behind Every unfolding events unreal. like watching TV show except hardly entertaining. real poison anglophone world (saying annoyance also English, Australian one Belgian old dude FB feed, anti mask crowd) idea doubts establishments, hand hand populous ideologies, brought people came powers, twisted sense exceptionalism, on. shit show become, impossible amounts heartbreaks people lost loved ones. makes question reality anymore.

So bizarre sad scary, really. Naive, stupidity, ignorant (thinking members laws eventually bring home left house 5 months safe essential errands precautions) already dangerous - I'm saying relatively safe country ok handling - denial self righteous pricks prickettes everywhere like states US whole layer careless destructive action. 
The world connected. doomed. Day 15 boss still gotten results. took mine last Wednesday I'm sure rate I'll two weeks go.

It noted keeps reported Australia largely one city/state state borders closed. Much country eliminated community spread completely. Geezus. got tested Ontario doctor requested it. results next day. Long term, plan prevent free plan deteriorating. America, public good rich use (basically everything except police) gets defunded destroyed time. There's way they'd limit cost. share market value would plummet overnight. think voting RBG's replacement. love Biden, lot job nominating qualified people, qualified people go near Donald Trump.  misinformation suppression facts done major damage. better informed positive result takes time negative Canada least sites looked at. people get result 2 days many getting day results despite us testing many people. Oh, said? isn't. weak pathetic can't control realize that, may WANT see them, personal wants important making fucking pandemic go away. Stop trying counter point even make. They're going deaths lag 21 days behind infection, average. certainly gotten better treat patients, pretty quick we're going see deaths start tick again, matching infection curve started going back weeks ago. answer, grew like Kansas, great kid, horrible teen twenties, I'd kill dog go back late thirties. typo. Anyone's dog. That's First Past Post works. nothing tribalism. want ranked choice voting know well enough that, meantime, voting Democrats gets closer rather throwing vote away. Also, surely prevalent gets harder keep care homes, workers get infected. eat humble pie already ask mainland help. hear Shanghai already organised medical team (that is, addition team deployed Xinjiang) bags packed ready depart moment's notice case Hong Kong needs help.  Bermuda. test results take 5-8 hours. Biden doesnt know whether coming going half time. I'm pretty sure getting dementia. seem wife come get stage??? standing staring ""snapped"" grabbed him. Well makes feel better, regular flu along myriad diseases kill 23 year olds time. personally know 3 people age 30 died flu lifetime. saying virus worse know thing sudden kill you, never invincible. Nobody 11 kids. absolute numbers, course not. per capita numbers, better, behind country like Germany. believe called ""rock bottom"" US illegal disclose medical conditions co-workers. sure trying cover butt avoid potential lawsuit. may true, none us answer, I'm also allowed make comments without grilled solving said problem, point comment first place. many people discussions thread, person could easily engaged someone constructive conversation he/she wanted engage that. That's probably true. #NYstrong saw three times many deaths Covid entire country Germany. Florida 40 thousand fewer cases Covid NYC roughly seventh deaths.

Chances going much better Covid long term, matter morbid cheerleading. Weird times. Education system failed us countries talking sure fuck aren’t ones you’re talking lmfao Bro thought different republican party always stood for, blind. right always stood defiantly denying science disagrees preconceptions. right always stood worst shit world. infected 16 roommates per article. That's eht entire cause people hating Got tested Belgium Saturday afternoon, got results Monday-morning even though loads company making bridge Sunday national holiday Tuesday. apologized took long. Actually, that’s scientifically proven. stayed home 9
Months ZERO social contact zero learning, would cause set backs? Yes. 

But hope situations figure authority, child’s parents, teachers, loved ones, would able provide two things least capacity. let bill pass Republicans continue actively try repeal it. There's clear distinction here, even neither party enthusiastic leadership level RCV. Home. Thank you! Who, I’m sure, came told exact thing guy fired. “You need embrace masks immediately you’re going lose bigly”. RIP. happening there??.. u know need self distance wear mask.... mainly bcoz stupid ppl. Shitty education systems fire start bar 5 people stomped death, died direct fire? really know, incident killed them, 

I dont agree. ignores human error.

What 5 people could easily escaped, lock door? still killed fire, killed stupidity?

Or look something like flu. ""X"" number people dying flu. could something policies. could say (stupidly) ""If flu patient hospital, cant allow anyone else treated hospital."" going bunch extra people dying cant get treated whatever. 

Did make flu deadly? people die result stupid policy?

I know town closed hospitals even built emergency field hospital. hospitals remained almost empty field hospital remained unused. really low Covid numbers. someone operation cancelled died result, really blamed Covid? could treated. There's much evidence showing rise anti-christ, digress. Ok. many comercial flights transport bodies. blood? test via sample taken mouth. possible establish rules make easy lf legal concerns. Yeah saw lol. checked made comment.  joking... Yeah, nothing showing anything prove point. politic tribalism end. They've gotten many brainwashed, even realize it. HIPAA, employer probably allowed disclose information. Ahhhh.. old Loony Tunes trick..

Covid-19 July:..... still risked life. That's something minimize. That's ignorance. That's reckless endangerment. agree. also like point reason, old white men appear moral arbiters people. leave he’s trying philosopher act like he’s digging little deeper rest us, fact he’s throwing guessing game mortality rate around. 

When brought even lowest scale would bring everyone caught Covid, tried pull Kyrie Irving “I’m saying lot, saying anything” kind moment. It’s exactly election. polling continually lower, he’s even getting Fox.

Make quick guess, many Americans died 2019? one saying that, please god tell post joke.

[In case someone wants original, less compressed image Eh, thr American way. better everyone else better virus. cannot hindered. worst possible option either two major parties remaining power. voting them, choosing perpetuate problem, hoping people one day fix issue you.

I personally think recent surge cases roots densely populated community housing (generally residents live paycheck paycheck), ones felt sick may position stay isolated effectively. housing specifically communal bathrooms, amazing vector even infected people sharing others. Additionally less 20 new cases day country thought may swung towards there's 1 million chance it'll me, need go work feed kids.
I believe isolating more, large portion recently infected may right thing best could staying home, homes woefully equipped situation. (United States): What's happening directive send hospital data HHS processed private company instead CDC?

The second wave could much fiercer first


VUB biostatistician Kurt Barbé sounds alarm again. scientist updated graphic model illustrating forecasts hospitalizations due coronavirus country. cautions: turn tide quickly, second wave, actually would already started, may well fiercer first.


In Facebook post, Professor Barbé points planned update model quickly. latest hospitalization figures released Sciensano show larger increase expected.

“My model maintains current R (the virus reproduction rate, editor's note) 1.2064. Yesterday (read Monday, Editor's note), colleague Geert Molenberghs gave overview projections made mid-May second wave could look like. I'm afraid data line pessimistic forecasts made time, ”Kurt Barbé explains Facebook.


Thus, according Professor Barbé's new model, country fact already struck famous second wave. number new hospitalizations still increasing gradually, everything accelerate September reach new peak beginning November. According graph, peak November almost twice big one experienced April. time, 6,000 Covid patients hospitalized. figure could reach 10,000 months. number patients intensive care would follow curve, say least, frightening.


The VUB professor fears local lockdowns inevitable. “We facing exponential growth yet sufficient awareness process multiplication. He's slow, makes easy downplay, that's exactly danger. still July 31 reverse trend. Stabilizing enough ”, warns biostatistician. getting paid quarantining?

Maybe bills pay. so, failure capitalism, individuals. good point brought up- wasn’t even aware issue. hope things start looking soon. Ok?
Damm.

gl guys...seems like need lot right :( treat USB disk though may virus it? I.e., wash hands handling touching face personal items, keep disk quarantined 2 3 days. be. article people narcissists tend follow COVID health guidelines. describe behaviors beliefs narcissistic. study came 1 town though. means guide. know bunch narcissistic people wear mask cleaned Costco back March might something. go people got $1,200 handout nothing. fine. /s Tremendous job- tremendous job- efforts heroic Yeh, potential spread country's apathy, also dangerous, *idiots (nonvoters, folks stay engaged least minimum (voting) participation keeping community/govt healthy), spread countries make less safe next pandemic hits.

Besides, think they'd let us point.

I wonder I'm seeing number pro masking stuff/posts suddenly. plans visit countries cancelled.

*edit correct...use word idiot, thought original ancient Greek term one self centered, selfish, participating democracy, read refs calling word origin question, may wrong there, though think anyone voting/participating causing harm democracy, country low participation rate. Depends place kind job. I’m wfh indefinitely.

Edit: like method mentioned though. It’s mandatory place work. America constant propaganda teach people America free country every country third world. got pledge allegiance, singing national anthem non-international sporting events, constant flag waving, course, fox news.

So anyone ever tells America #1, well must conspiracy bring country. case able charge 500,000$ single vaccine. what, communism? MURICA! Sweden: 559 deaths per million
Germany: 110 deaths per million

What trying accomplish this?

It looks horrible Sweden. Plain simple. course, total lockdowns exist - Populations people cannot trusted. listen punishment. upside ‘not killing people’ enough people self-absorbed assholes. Season two got weird.    Fuck woman. Living Destin/PCB years back it’s really hard understand why. Saying ""experts"" headline extremely misleading. experts interviewed union leaders labor advocates, public health experts. They're saying anything preventing larger outbreaks, keeping workers safe. admit even work converting online-only may completely solve safety problem either influx gig workers would store pick fulfill orders. generate data necessary epidemiological analysis outbreak. one ever said two percent, anyone brain, also death rate 0.6% tried Google? I'm Iowa, want give bad information. found this, *March* take grain salt: Google search type ""Site:.gov"" pull search results Iowa state government pages (assuming word Iowa typed elsewhere search). Good luck. Oh cool, asshole finally recommends maybe dad stop plague rat wear mask. 


Hes going home depot grocery store daily. anything specific, hes narcissist thinks liberals made Corona. Regularly. kung-flu. Something water sun makes people stupid. Username checks live NZ. shut country down. 22 deaths. America 145,000 deaths...

We masks, social distancing, sports games crowds stadiums, malls, schools businesses open. took 8 weeks stamp it. 10/10 would recommend someone who's Indian family moved USA. really touch what's going india.
Edit: also wanted add, that's weird thing Indians say indians know moved USA get medicines shipped india turns much cheaper quality drugs. like AIDS late 80s. Everyone it. Recommend obstaining sex, sex wear condom.

The US one big unprotected orgy right now. already baked estimates, good try Hospitalizations 59,316 yesterday, probably April 15 Well dumb cunt fined Must awful mother. best positive negative it? can't give result run test, dont know whose tests definitely positive run first. Charge attempted murder That’s husband cousins grew up. grandparents large amount farm land everyone family built houses it, parents, aunts, cousins, etc. live area. Honestly, ymmv, husband HATES it.

When family constantly (and don’t jobs), gossip day. Every time go there, hear bunch drama horses week. There’s actually privacy. husband’s parents moved away got bad and, house grandparent’s property, couldn’t even sell lost ton money. grandparents pass away, expect whole family going implode inheritance drama. That’s normal size family. 4 lot people community.

There nothing cult like 4 5 children all

Edit: saw reply. Sorry got defensive, mistook intending office doctor sounds like violated coworkers privacy takes ingenuity, takes believing science also shoves burden entirely onto women. know plenty women wearing masks giving dozen--no men. yet ""Karen"" one still criticized enough. 

Where's Kyle's sewing machine? idea detrimental second lockdown would be? stupid people understand, much (younger) people die lose livelihood second lockdown, (mostly old) people die Covid.

120 deaths state 39 million people... everyone savings live 2 weeks awaiting test results. pay people come work wait test results, voluntarily. pay stay home awaiting results dont let work awaiting results, create incentive structure discourages testing altogether, company suffers outbreak. would even able quarantine house 16 people? Trump's PR team employed specifically stop public thinking villainous dictator: ""Since Donny Boy finally mask train gotta design something really says 'benevolent genius saviour people' I'm think... BLACK""
Other PR members: ""mmmm yes ! put sigil terrifying eagle side!"" anti mask/vaccines people finally get board.

Let's fair man: anti-vax problem long took office, even base anti-vax, rather bunch Paltrow/McCarthy-type Facebook users thinking homeopathy, quartz, detox valid demonstrable scientific solutions health issues. Sounds convinced local health department call. Tell story, ask official quarantine order send peak pandemic April, 59,538 people hospitalized nationwide April 15, according Covid Tracking Project. number reached lowest level June 15 27,772 people hospitalized. July 20, number climbed back 58,330 -- hints beneath April's high. Wait exactly sound like owner anti-mask. says feel equipped kick people out, reasonable. People assaulting workers throwing tantrums store, refusing leave, even stabbing/threatening shoot asked wear masks.

Why business owners enforcers mask mandates? Even theft prevention generally taught try apprehend offenders own. # USA research publicly available anyway. fuck working competetively instead cooperatively. think, school shootings amuse bouche. UK, mostly used bypass queues waiting lists. There's also ""better"" service, like better food, nicer private rooms, etc. 

They also get money/insurance, we're paying tax money fund fancy healthcare. Maybe *deserve* children, can't *afford* children. 

I *deserve* outdoor kitchen, want buy credit I'm waiting. common sense, compassion others, decency gone?  Well well. turn tables. Even still, that's two half families 5 kids per family. Absolutely insane.  don’t think that’s true. It’s unethical, don’t think it’s illegal. I’ve unpopular opinion long time areas need evacuated hurricane, occupied. Don’t build floodplain; Don’t allow construction, vehicles parked, landownership there, even camping hurricane season. Treat floodplains like would downward slope active volcano. habitable land. Welcome American Healthcare. 1 major reason want catch COVID, leaving young ones behind without anyone taking care them. several coronaviruses circulation, SARS. Also wow didn’t know NIH wasn’t good source now.

Seriously criteria acceptable news pretty much starts stops “does spell disaster humanity?” Yup slowed right week too. saying actually knows fake, putting facade boost reelection chances. think got horrible forecasts next months going look like realized something change numbers going bad he'll chance getting re-elected. Make mistake - reason said determined self-interest so. fair two types test viral one antibody test. antibody test takes like 15 minutes get result viral takes 24 hours short time frame ones hear likely antibody test aren’t accurate test positive virus coronavirus family includes common cold. viral test accurate takes long time fair, it’s highly possible roommates kids already Covid given close proximity living quarters. 11 people one apartment insanely cramped.

She told can’t held legally liable. ""they're already?"" 16 people household? live rock lack sort comprehensive ability can't figure I'm talking Dominic Cummings. Good real estate options months! Anti-maskers going become threatening violent. told people die actually stay dead, although think working that. Something call ""undead."" (Translation Google. Let know spot faults I'll correct them!)

**Slightly fewer patients receive hospital care covid-19 region compared Tuesday.** 

The number inpatients confirmed covid-19 Skaraborg Hospital seven people Wednesday, one intensive care unit. two fewer Tuesday number nine.

If look region's hospitals general, figure total 66 patients. 11 receive intensive care. means number decreased five last 24 hours. Two fewer receive intensive care.

Up including Tuesday, total 17,500 people tested positive covid-19 region.

This distribution different hospitals Västra Götaland region Wednesday:

**NU healthcare:** 8 people, 0 IVA 

**Sahlgrenska University Hospital:** 39 people, 8 IVA

**The hospitals Väster:** 5 people, 0 IVA

**Skaraborg Hospital:** 7 people, 1 IVA

**Södra Älvsborg Hospital:** 7 people, 2 IVA No. HIPAA, covered entities (most health care providers, health plans, health care clearinghouses) may disclose protected patient health information permitted. add this, he's pushed people federal agencies deems ""not loyal"" co-worker's girlfriend tested positive. I'd astounded relations... went get tested told they're low tests get tested shows symptoms self isolate 14 days return work symptoms arise. Well 2 guys work muster hope start seeing symptoms too. I'm frequently standing right next said coworker. Fun times Slightly topic - live state medical cannabis, medical marijuana card, covered HIPAA? reading bit /r/conservative today... lots folks acknowledge expressed support Ghislaine Maxwell, hate done.

But they're still voting Trump he's Biden. WTF. video? Surely link. addition early outbreaks hit age populations evenly somewhat effective protecting 50 crowd.

Remdesevir might helping well. 

But end virus virus I’m sure people rooting victims shaming one state another. link following cooke popup caused pause.. 

 traded 5000 lives eating restaurants.

It trade eating restaurants. risk took keep children going school youth university, keep families friends meeting, keep economy working, avoid elders isolated. Etc. 

Could prevent 5000 deaths? likely. risky decision swedes say whether worth. mean, long history hacking international online fraud record ages back decades ago thought costs buck five? always, Trump late action. provided free hotel room could quarantined without exposing people cohabitates, paid sick leave top that. 

You're advocating throwing people jail refusing become homeless let kids go hungry. That’s still one nascar race worth people. 

Maybe 1.5mil people would consider caring.  always claim do, direct way show past. GOP time ok coronamerican curious one people always one thing another going on?  coworker lived house 11 people once. 5 adults 7 children. 2 her’s. save money. don’t want ever situation. talk pretend stuff politicians do.... sentence say religious. Hint: religion pretend bullshit made junk too. want tell experience. wife tested positive. employer made quarantine soon doctor advised too. quarentined onset symptoms. test took 5 days come back. employer allow quarantine untill positive result. fucking US situation in. cunt. Seriously. double deaths still less 1 thousand each, Sweden 5x more.

Edit: put ten times five times quick testing common yet? Places 24 hour results Congrats geniuses Yep - starting 2016 election... bet people sex guards hotel quarantine would let go outside live interstate. Also, paradox *needing* go work keep healthcare lest get fired pandemic leaving insurance.

The whole idea forcing people go work get/afford healthcare abhorrent. I’m even Bernie proponent! OK Imma this. When? Guess updated. faith Texas. able get thousand day September. Cowards die many times deaths; valiant never taste death once. Nope. HIPAA apply employers. 

Good employers won’t want blast business around, health care providers. Doesn’t matter island , amazing job forgotten downplayed. mean CDC also tell people wear masks monhs too? nothing lockdown. Southern parts Sweden excess death rates Denmark (hard lockdown). High death rates relate parts Sweden overwhelmed infection combination catastrophic organization nursing homes. People aged 70+ without need help society increase death rates indicating strategy correct. 

Don’t confuse increased death rates compared neighboring countries type lockdown correlate. Nothing indicates causation.  clear, even were, there's long way go yet plenty chance get worse again.

For instance, mask usage UK actually proportionally half U.S. still mandatory shops Friday. extremely difficult enforce, clear much effect have. There's also expected lot resistance vaccine. mention huge number people rushing abroad holidays ASAP, realistically going kick things again.

Cases currently dropped managablely insignificant, sure, nowhere near bottomed hoped. makes believe firmly China innocent one here?

Also, evidence provide reason US one it, shouting air without single evidence?

Lastly, ""trick"" use predict future? worked well? No, mismanaged nursing homes home care elderly. (Almost badly New York did)

Over 75% deaths let's least honest. relaxed shutdown may responsible deaths much smaller percentage.

Not mention, second wave + casualties related COVID-19 lockdowns, may end better totally mortal rate. 

It's way early drop mic.  California loves sanctuary cities, illegals, anchor babies, future Democrat voters. RAPID ANTIGEN TESTING SOLUTION. 

Go listen TWIV podcast episode 640 hear say testing. Basically antigen tests detect virus par PCR tests cost 75% less results 15 minutes. article mentioned is. Although find hard believe could prove children contracted Covid found positive, beforehand.

That said, probably can’t afford lawyer. Anecdotally, harder many get tests be. Almost like money slowly released trickle testing slower? Nah, can't be. Californias rent outrageous, takes 16 people pay bills?? I'm talking you. clearly never worked before. understand compassion, he's son all. need protect though. Give choice, wear mask, come over. love-hate relationship reproductive organs.

I suspect people issue (with theirs). waiting length days California. 2 weeks testing &amp; result. man third wife, who’s accused sexual assault rarely goes church (too busy golfing). definitely plays evidence weak. ignore that.  Oh god role models growing up, wonder smoke now. Fuck man...  I’m pretty sure say “an employee” instead outright naming them? Like everyone small workplace probably figure out, but.... idea? Fuck you’re moron. Things happen wore mask 3 months ago. Today: lack space forced quarantine. world runs honor system. think there’s much widespread abdication even repudiation honor. She’s going need new roommates soon. Hopefully nice big storm targets ft lauderdale. get rapid test it’s hard do. people lazy don’t give shit drop /s I've waiting ""big reveal"" virus people countries worse affected others. think (BBC):

  Man, children truly greatest joy greatest heartache.

I that. We’ve avoided pandemic due daughter laws father dying unexpectedly Arizona mostly. dad 10 years older u am, turned 53 passed away floor one knows autopsy report back. reason mention told son don’t know died COVID not, live Texas spent lot time back forth Arizona worst hit. I’m babbling crying right I’m overwhelmed admit strangers online I’m truly scared never able understand either. read gospels clear side on. know people really read though. could happened ANYWHERE WORLD Hi, I'm sure post question. likely think risk infection working public gym completely alone? apartment building small gym free weights, single squat rack, ect. 

I've going early morning workout week now. wear mask covering mouth nose completely even though sealed room doors nobody else me. bring rag spray bottle wipe everything bleach water touch it. Felt fine far. risk high though? Everything I've read online public gyms related around people.

I'll probably also get flak taking risk right now, scoliosis back exercises weights helps less pain I'm standing walking. also work 100% home live 1br real risk infecting people. seen another human outside grocery store since March lol politicians media deal fear. That’s testing helps tease out. testing likely thorough past vaccines, order get idea safety. Also, suspect General Public first population group receive vaccine. Front-Line Healthcare workers, first responders, teachers, etc be. used like Beta Testers. Probably unpopular opinion but, preemptively kill roommate. anything weird body. son got person, undeniable symptoms. test came back positive, came back negative. I'm little skeptical accuracy tests. People children can't afford? Agree! fact people told assume positive isolate awaiting test results, nobody pays (unless come back positive case get paid retroactively) next level stupid. fact state set quarantine hotels people can't isolate without exposing others home stay free charge next level stupid.

The fact poor people choice expose families coworkers want children go hungry become homeless something else entirely. sitting directly air ventilator? It’s small town, it’s Minneapolis. Yeah whole idea hospitals given money covid deaths beyond ludicrous. Like, rewarded losing patients? nutjobs even think?  sad weak way live. loss rest America must unusually cheap. prefer middle America get nice ass house yard $200,000 People refuse wear masks go wishes doctors Prosecuted. Corona effects every one, you. Seems like kinda relate. We’ve pretty much hunkered down- dine restaurants, grocery pick up/delivery drive target. Nothing social. mom working home stepdad retired. working preschool teacher, couldn’t justify going back classroom setting 1000 deaths state today, blessed get private home nanny position, full time. Much less risk.

I get frustrated cause I’m getting age worry losing parents. They’re 60’s pretty healthy, virus wildcard. don’t want go stage lives constantly worried brink tears.  Touché. I'm honestly somewhat fence mandatory quarantine armed guard, absolutely need quarantine hotels people unable isolate without exposing others live stay quarantine *for free.* tests connected able make profit.

In USA, profit involved, it’s going slow painful wait, like TSA line Miami airport. Infuriatingly painful slow developing nation backwards underpaid lazy slow disaster. still arguments, bs. knew every state 2 senators, never clicked meant less densely populated states got representation. sucks. mean general Employee know (including myself) extent is: fever = Go work. Mostly none us want waste PTO could using vacations tad sick, especially first years office work get 2-3 weeks year. Bump people kids want save kids sick. takes truly ill stay home. Granted, count right WFH guess that's perk. Wallace always allowed neutral stance Fox.

Reality none watch him.

Primetime Hannity Tucker 90% bullshit comes from. saw similar poll last week said 31% people think Donald Trump honest. estimate 366 (95% CI 110-655) excess deaths 20 49 years age substantially exceeds reported number COVID-19 deaths 66.

I'm seeing seeing. 5.5x ain't good either. get pregnant unplanned. Others trying years. Yeah, may best time, long people refuse wear masks practice social distancing way people waste medical resources worse reason.
I'd rather help pregnant woman times, idiot ""believe"" corona wear mask. I’ve heard stance lot. interestingly enough many people America taking it.

As American, I’ve seen first hand devastation irreparable damage happened country inability push regulations lockdowns keep everyone safe page. sure, say lockdown could consequences own, listed. looking around, it’s hard imagine things worse right lockdown. Maybe economy sloppy growth decade right middle depression make public debt skyrocket? fucking selfish be. historians going look back able figure fucking EAT Southern Hillbilly Gomer Face due poor social security US? easy call sick still job security? remember reading also right vacation days. really tricky go vacation sometimes. generation taught better last. Even missing year next generation citizens knowledgeable generation them. California bigger state. understand semantics this, also like saying Rhode Island Idaho can't serious problem absolute numbers never reach big figure. Well used brains would known virus care politics wants feed spread hosts... Apparently word if... becomes someone comes different conclusion mean thinking independently. know. couple weeks ago, would said ""armed guards"", saw well worked Australia; I'm pretty sure armed eunuch guards would sort human rights violation. People numb now. 140k dead? K. That's attitude absolutely horrifying stone-hearted people are. care one own. see alot customers leaning side plexiglass masks chin. Unless put cashiers enclosed bubble protect stupid. Minnesota things like describe. Less 24hrs results short wait. situation radically different state state, frustrating. I’m scared too. alone! depends pregnant workers allowed stay home aren't. Guessing workers can't stay home ones babies NICU. humans fighting back!  receive money government stuff? It’s scary deaf support facts. It’s like past didn’t happen even it’s tape. also live Alabama. wife tested took 4 days get result. told self-quarantine results came in. employer also required self-quarantine situation like this.  
Both stayed home waiting results. employers payed days. total employer 2 weeks allowed quarantine full pay 10 weeks 2/3 pay. Citymd got tested almost 2 weeks ago exactly wife mild symptoms wanted safe side everyone work with. got results back negative 1 week later (different testing center), hear back all. finally called work said already risk window come back in.  completely sealed room

In case, biggest concern airborne transmission. Someone COVID could use gym you, exhale small droplets containing virus, leave get there, (especially poor ventilation sealed rooms) droplets hang air minutes hours. cloth mask filter (60%, depending material, one study) droplets, good measure. 

This personal opinion, think working important health worth taking risks. Kinda weigh risk-benefit yourself. Oh look, like didn’t understand two week lab also don’t understand always faulty tests. 

Not news worthy. commented second ago, bears repeating. Rapid City, SD saw slowdown beginning (March/April) we've pretty much full every day since Memorial Day weekend. summer traffic slowed, seen it. hate subway argument. lived Boston three years, rode time. never got sick subway because, oh, right washed hands didn’t stick fingers mouth, nose, eyes. It’s like people taught basic fucking hygiene never even learned first place. Ugh! That's means. positive 70% chance negative 20% chance study right. remember reading studies shown suffer narcissistic personality disorder constantly deluding themselves. really good taking responsibility actions (many times malicious ones too) projecting onto people. 

For example, narcissistic ex might abuser relationship might go around saying abused. One might assume merely lying, that's thing, memory serves right, studies show capable editing memory incidents delude believing fact victim. 

One see people gravitate towards delusions talk wearing mask number reasons. Sure, meant least tell them, try minimise damage. Otherwise see knowing AIDs telling partner. wrong. Rural Canada seen wave yet anyone got positive test result took week get back? Maybe stopped rushing things used low-tech solutions now, like social distancing shutting economy, wouldn’t rushed products market assert whatever like, I've provided links declared disagree you. ""ALLEGEDLY pees""? China, damn virus first place. suppressed initial news virus allowed flourish due poor sanitation policies.

The United States one-party, oppressive dictatorship able contain degree were. Nonsense. get queen size bed private bathroom prison. No, 50 million people- 2 dose vaccine.

There option buy 500 million US think so. levels worse, plan leaving container candy outside. think many same. Sorry hear this. many bodies recovered, must frightening time. Parasite absolutely INTENSE. Loved it!!! dentist high risk? literally inside mouth can’t wear mask. Seems like right highest risk. That's interesting. specifically denied least 20 times Tegnell think weighs heavier slide. people quarantining get results. guess testing capacity overwhelmed would mean 14 days quarantine lot people symptoms (and longer isolation turn clinical symptoms).

A receipt Covid-19 test serve order quarantine take leave work 14 days receive negative result (which would serve legal purpose lift previous quarantine order). worry, rest world math figure become shithole start sending aid offering refugee status. People get test performed that’s ends. Every single test goes lab, think situation go through. someone worked testing lab (not covid) sample volume like hits get SLAMMED it’s probably taking 8-13 days they’re understaffed due covid freezer full 10000 samples. don’t get extra pay, LONG days working fast human possible boss says need day won’t change anything. It’s stressful labs need funded they’re not. I’ve seen many arguments testing one ever mentions helping labs actually tests. Ramping testing without ramping much labs increase test time even longer. president sign executive order directing money equipment labs (this lowering wait time test) know won’t happen. He’s busy unleashing army people. It’s frustrating there’s simple solution problem feels reach. anyone knows someone actually processing tests, please thank efforts let know it’s vain. easy forget tests mass produced quickly. things medicine created distributed manor. Yep. you’ve gotten positive test, still less 50/50 odds feeling Elizabethan times would got branded huge C. Regardless HIPAA (fuck btw, insurance co work around fuck us over) employee tests positive give permission inform coworkers possible, it’s right thing protect coworkers &amp; families.   generally, staying close home appears plan COVID-19 crisis fourth month U.S. expect travel anytime soon, 82% saying unlikely travel Labor Day holiday.

People travel. hope like hell I'm wrong, though. :( dentists say brushing teeth 2 times week place Okay next argument child I'll mutant supervillain. going beach fall this? Go it; actually reading published results, know Pfizer may actually robust immune response.

Oxford's really good publicity, look promising, may effective one. wife works hospital. presumptive positive (turned bacterial infection symptoms COVID). told come normal isolate receives positive test herself. Thankfully worry it, honestly could infected half office time get results back. decades like polio

Yes, level polio transmission low, least highly developed countries availability vaccines, people, effectively gone away.

This one generous plans American workplace. Two weeks might mean fired. Nobody yet knows many people die symptoms lockdown. decrease cancer diagnosis treatment, depression suicides, spousal abuse, poverty.. there’s long list reasons death don’t know numbers for.

Definitely not. School insane proposition. We’re middle plague. vaccine large complex instrument. needle serum.

It needs administered someone medical training, likelihood needs booster shot two weeks month.

Amazon alone delivered 3.5 billion parcels 2019. Every single one complex endeavor. Coca Cola ships 1.9 billion servings per *day*.

How may flu vaccines think delivered year?

I'm saying manufacturing logistics trivial, equipping everyone jet powered rollerskates training use here, either. NY still top mountain NY cases came NYC area tested people symptoms. Gyms city NY also banded together sue state open. feel kind badly however, state ripped phase 3 day suppose open - explanation - put phase 4 haven’t hit yet. It’s 6 months since they’ve closed doors one word governor open. friend spent thousands dollars putting new hospital grade air filtration, plastic barriers, social distanced machines, self cleaning handles doors etc sits watches STRIP CLUBS indoor malls allowed open not. would take anything , even 1/4 capacity. becomes even outraging whenever look common nazi propaganda tactics realize often used. main one cultural wars. shits big old dog whistle. likely significantly higher since many mild symptoms seem getting cell immunity without antibodies. Yea, Sweden almost bad Spain, Italy, UK, Belgium. Terrible. Good thing US Brazil handled Covid responsibly effectively compared Sweden. think, Donny Dumbshit? thought going go away. fucked open economy. economy fucked already is. Great job! 16 roommates, go work careless whatever- went work broke and/or get fired don't.

The blame fall woman. falls capitalism Finland get text message day test negative. Positive test takes longer get ready, 48hours positive doctor call you. 10 lot people, damn. sounds tough. hope China anything it! incredibly naïve. america's economy would benefit greatly way eliminating poverty, good luck passing laws required achieve that. 
shortsighted tax-averse idiots always bring down, makes america. 16 people home? That's many people live wouldn’t want mask dang airplane? feel like must different species sometimes. Living 16 people something.  I’m guessing seeing well mask mandating countries they’re starting rebuild economy really got endorsers.

“Hey mask mandating countries making money us!“  Cant disagree that. seriously happens time?

I've information need work going constantly pandemic technically government based. annoying shit disruptive.

Seriously, gotten bad even use internet connection work personal devices. think idea take every day, get something unusual possibly per day confirm, chance getting string false results lower. kind thing especially apparent look back old magazines. Look advertisements companies selling average person. Brand new boats average person could afford, etc. Look magazine see days long gone. average ""working man"" (gender used boat ads targeted) go looking brand new boat days. Joe Rogan audacity say Masks pussies push conspiracy theories Covid. shit precisely why, country, get choice self isolate. sent quarantine facility can't interact anyone else regularly tested test negative. Oh, look, South Korea also like 99% mask compliance we're stupid asshats.

People simply cannot trusted follow health guidelines. President Twatty McFuckface Nope beach, resturants, shopping school ever elese may went. CM. Thank you. understand Disney helping. reason moved Florida taking many trips year. would fly points stay sister's. Hell back could get $40 round trip tickets last minute made one trip like ""I'm going watch fireworks tonight, see tomorrow"". 

My partner said ""look hate jobs miserable here. move probably watch fireworks work"".

So get need, even legit people putting mental health physical. fucked that? think important. wonder stop using nursing homes excuse? amount deaths (in percentage) nursing homes less Scandinavian countries “Lets pretend doesn’t exist make seem like there’s pandemic “ Awesome! literally recycled Soviet propaganda communism making wait lines everything. 

Since Americans believe socialism = Communism lite 

And since Canada universal healthcare socialist. 

And since socialist problems communist dictatorship would have, slightly less severe. It’s county. It’s particular group that’s lost it’s sanity humanity. Reddit: Reeeeeeeeeeeee need way employees handle without people wait weeks orders. ~12 billion cover country. wonder markup’s gonna be. regulation many samples tested method testing? Safety? yet one ever actually provided data back up... strange. rate, accrue three million new infections within thirty days. August 29 USA hit 7,000,000 cases going pace. believe sums part reopening plans made sense me. Virus spreads easily indoors masks used. So, let’s open indoor dining bars can’t wear mask eating drinking. Brilliant.

It's getting business running, keeping people safe. assholes charge exchanging people's safety minimal tax revenue. need indoor dining, small restaurants can't seat enough folks make ends meet.

They're denial scope this, amounts science evidence convince greedy narcissists important money. Easy, aerosol droplets. settings bars restaurants salivating conversing force close confine spaces drinks food exposed droplets. bars restaurants music converse people closer 6ft. Studies show yelling singing happens infection rate increases R factor. Digital security, potential fuck data trials, personal health information trial participants...

Let science work. We'll see published data ready. big secret.

Also, I'd much inclined take people seriously calling Sinovac Cansino put data open source.... Uh, like tyrannic regimes historically killed 30 % population purges.

Covid killing weakest individuals society; elderly people health problems, plus people poor afford decent care. point view eugeneticist/social darwinist, perfect purge. dream brother went tested positive stormed room beat ass. can’t imagine angry would someone house went without telling tested positive. heard they're starting relax regulations test FOUR! samples once. gonna long year. unlike dumbasses south, learned situation improved. all, whatever reason decided best course action pretend over! want people impressed, want us pat back feel better stupid are? 0 deaths, contributing 70% daily 800-1,000. even gonna need vaccine rate? anticipate virus surging many places once, **the experts assumed would learn NYC.**

Yet another thing experts got wrong. Plus I’m sure experts also didn’t expect we’d president would bury head sand, essentially pretend (and still pretending) virus go away. expect governors would suing mayors prevent mandatory mask orders. 

How could experts wrong everything?

Thanks experts. can't find Louisiana map?

Like... how? never states Elementary school? Youve never wanted see long drive New Orleans?

Different question, many states put map? Texas, California, state neighbors? actual capital economics article shows difference Denmark, Norway Sweden small.

Another report EU agency shows less same, economic damage -8% non-euro countries (Denmark Sweden remember corretcly) Poland -8.5% euro countries. Approximate numbers, I'm going look EU report again. makes complete sense. state really good job locking opened way early. Also AZ, day 16 waiting son’s results. (He’s totally fine now.) Herd immunity right around corner. Where's beef? want know many people dead. LOL. TL;DR? late talking spread, economic impact. Countries get 10% GDP tourism obviously suffer regardless due virus. Countries like Sweden/Denmark/etc get lot less suffer less. nothing lockdown vs lockdown decision make. expect countries rely tourism better off. going compare countries (regarding strategy), probably need adjust that.

That point making. Right, factor odds actually it, don’t know take test. there’s 10% chance it, four possibilities odds look like this: 

- 90% odds don’t it, 80% odds get true negative = 72% chance get true negative

- 90% odds don’t it, 20% odds get false positive = 18% chance get false positive

- 10% it, 70% get true positive = 7% chance get true positive

- 10%, 30% = 3% chance get false negative.

So general population, 7%+18%=25% tests return positive. 25%, fewer 1 3 actually positive.  ~~Not California longer~~ *No longer felony California* Pretty much look TOTAL death averages 2019 earlier versus 2020 like 200,000 discrepancy  google trump chris wallace. might disappointed though, commenter kind overselling it. anything norm Trump. Wallace hardly soft interview either, he's become pretty famous specifically grilling Trump one-on-ones. It’s Arizona. wife got test Chicago 14 days results. Luckily she’s fine test precautionary, can’t turn results around quickly, tests completely pointless. lot countries helping quarantined people delivering free food don’t go outside. friend husband got tested Florida. 13 days later still results.  Yeah people get disproportionately angry violent asked wear masks. time pre-2020 people wouldn’t even walk stores without shirts sign door, even did, well experience cashiers served anyways time left.

But people wearing masks spreading deadly disease violent angry. way dangerous situation shirts. mask thing enforced, bunch 17 year olds earning minimum wage. Businesses need armed guards point safe asking dumb fucks wear masks solved. 6 month time frame solve also makes easier. know, unless nothing invest solution. would stupid enough that? and, well, idea communism is. Sorry, bud. fiancé’s son mother got tested. waited results job forced come anyway. also hid positive case building everyone CDC forced disclose it. I’m sure lots employers this. According health department done. wish ignorant situation could angry ""idiots."" Instead feel totally powerless identity motivating force humans have, aside protecting kids danger.  We're gonna get control anytime soon, we? problem. linked original article additional source press Source dpa.  Well also option Private insurance plans copay things.

But talking spending 8€ per month physical therapy 20€ bag various prescription meds pharmacy cases.  shame incidents like fall squarely US government. 16 people house woman without paid sick leave? hell person supposed do? supposed successfully isolate? support children several weeks without paycheck? would necessarily understand need make gargantuan sacrifices message top bad?

Answer ""here, tested positive. We'll ensure get paid sick leave work quarantine recover. place isolate others? not, here's room nearest quarantine facility. Staff provide meals health monitoring. Feel better soon."" End story. 

We putting people impossible situations here. everyone work home right now, personal space isolate sick, magically take hit working weeks. FIX THAT, rather yelling vindictively prison. old article, logic sound. Fewer people driving = fewer car accident deaths. People social distancing wearing masks = fewer flu remind people cities survived plagues think he’s pointing China might lying handle COVID-19. unfortunately US behavior immediately election matters earlier events. Trump correct earn votes even though insane academic article claiming children found transmit disease teachers. verify indeed 10*10 = 100 emotes. numbers based check 20 samples. much larger study needed actually useful data. So...the virus going overcome testing capacity, mainly ignorance......and course stupidity. dont know say. masks worn protect others. Shocker Yes! friend works casino sick. He’s home trying get better. Plus 300 million Oxford vaccines government already ordered enough everyone wants injection That's point though. Children seem spread virus adults within school I'd say charged criminally, time, probably couldnt afford isolate, 50% her, 50% gov't. free choice whether would like temporarily move

Nothing personally, idea people living 11 deep apartment somewhere else go laughable. Yeah I’m always gonna mask I’m sick run errand. Also committing flu shots never did. Well, no. Try reading again. Oof. shit? first I've heard loophole would really like avoid whatever asshole company can. I’m operating observation drug prices treatments work United States.

How mich cost make vial insulin days? Couple dollars point? Can’t really mich technology proven streamlined.

They sell shit $1k month. buddy wrong. Testing states takes 3 days that's presumed positive already. Ifbyourbpresumed positive(show symptoms contact) 24 hours. told go work carry usual told isolate stay safely away others. Unless friend randomly decided get tested, symptoms reasons get tested went life usual cause reason otherwise.

Stop spreading stories friends dunno talking about. math based assumption that's impossible prove, even example right right one case would redone every possible percentage hypothetical averaged come 50/50 business

It's moot point anyway, ""study"" sample size twenty accurate critique argument. Mississippians still richer Europeans. wonder what's going inside heads people...but think I'm better knowing Global Times editor-in-chief denies blocking US diplomats entering Wuhan Weibo

One worst things America dominance servile customer service culture. Retail employees need able defend belligerence unreason. customer almost always wrong.

Wait sec...16 people household? Would've liked see N. S.

That’s enough 1/3 total US population, think it’s front line workers. I’m responding comment 11 children; arguing something different entirely (and something one disputing begin with) effort save face. Except retail sales look nearly retail stocks.

The places hurt ones forced remain closed. 16 people living house? probably knew place ""isolate""...lol. Govt start paying hotel rooms really want poor people isolate... I’m sorry, hate division caused many people families. It’s sad we’re made feel guilty something like good luck hope understand American personalities linked defiance coronavirus prevention guidelines hoarding.

Fixed youse.

 problem America ignorance correct procedures, intentional negligence best-practices, sake bottom line. punish Corporations Government? create Human Slaves tortured Machine. Took sister 12 days get results Denver. 

My husband got tested week ago results Kansas City, said 5-7 days. 

Our current numbers great picture happening... two weeks ago. fair, that's outside norm Philly. Thank you, much appreciated! time, many people biking less densely populated areas may pass one entire ride. think that's classified low additional risk considerations (if crowding/passing others, risk increases). California girls used early 60s. inaccurate criticism point Nice yesterday Heads up, children ones schools. faculty, high schoolers, colleges... STOP thinking CHILIDREN ones schools!!! bit Catch 22 ol'Jair, it? want wish anyone death, reason... nothing short death stop Jair spinning ""... See? told nothing! bit flu!"".

Same news Oxford Uni vaccine break through. Half joyed half dreading Trump going use information way validate assessment pandemic. like person see paper goods, sanitizing supplies, masks go missing weeks time people panic-shopping, grocery stores remaining open.

I come back sub then, almost immediately regret it. bad pandemic been, there's always overprivileged genius whose well-meaning measures would make everything 100x worse. Netherlands done things right. aren’t ones it’s 4 million cases. America embarrassment world. disagree. HIPAA important protecting health information certain covered entities. want doctors office handing medical records pharmaceutical company without consent make money me. includes COVID. imagine much they’d love get hands data? health data isn’t related COVID? don’t know point... it’d basically free all. much greater things need handled first start picking apart HIPAA order try “solve” problem. Wasn’t slow response (ie non response) intentional?  intentionally obtuse?

Kept poorly managed (i.e. causing deaths) also synonymous.

It's binary. Calm down

EDIT: took wall text trying convince hill billy town great saying fucked America. thing people remember look sheer amount people United States. systems place place testing never meant test massive amounts people. 

Not saying government shouldn’t created labs ordered testing systems. small country compare something like US one states likely population countries there. exactly story. Whole office got sick round time, went doc, fever docs Corona tests.

I got sick, lied doc make symptoms severe ensure got test. Tried self isolate 100%, results 12 days later everything cleared up.

Every single person know sick point last 4 weeks. conformed positive. I'm curious; deaths count COVID-19 related deaths listed kidney liver failure? makes wonder part reason COVID-19 fatalities may low. instructed....and rebelled. fuck wrong people......  “GDP per capita” ""essential"" workers often hired contractors, covered things like FFCRA. There's also issue test results delayed several days burn two weeks fairly quickly everyone around contracts virus several periods uncertainty.  In, what, 6 months? located? would help context. General state county would help. start spiking cases? Places like Florida, Texas, Arizona took time cases went hospitalizations increase. Also average age infected people could lot lower seeing less hospitalizations. far scientists found evidence suggest becoming less deadly. /*shudders* 

I remember one time balls swelled began hurt years ago, fun... Lol wtf... upvoting damn actually case people literally lame... Ahh bummer :( oh well confirm, live Texas.

A friend mine Lupus bad things. multiple heart attacks spend months months hospitals kindsnof reasons 34. would dead wasnt system. thx paying pot people like live pretty damn well worth extra % income. think we've downplayed tragedy keep insisting everything fine sake economy, apparently. keep perpetuating lie can't harmed virus 60, all. probably 4th lol

Probably not, try 18th: averaging 500 cases day 10-15k 🤷‍♂️ ? 

Why? Possibly already burned population. silly think disease proceeding way. Remember flattening curve hospitals overwhelmed? 

That's Texas, Florida, California did. may tough times ahead, see anything like experienced NYC. Absolutely gut wrenching. Listening kids talk hits right heart. worst part kids grieve, millions fools continue tell people 'not wear masks' 'just flu'. Nobody go something like this. Yet another reason Canada great place live. Right wing populists too. Thank much. love lol. Yeah it’s media living laws think entire thing fake cost trump election get money people. Please stay safe!! SARS-CoV-2 test developped Prof. Drosten (the guy co-discovered SARS sr.), endorsed used literally every country around abovementioned German validation study 15 1930 samples showed false positives RT-PCR vs. 1 Target. Due test looking two targets standard lab version real specifity results get 99,9% i.e. almost false positives.

Can anyone across pond explain CDC went inferior solution?   giant signs say “masks required” nary mask sight. know voted for. Right. law even states don’t need test result. go employer claim using Covid bam two weeks. Reported misinformation. headline ""poll"" good information. prison. Yes. already knew this, US ordered roughly 500M doses 2021   employer 500 employees FFCRA apply unfortunately I’m CA. work, symptoms, allowed return work show negative test. time takes get test results covered emergency PTO whether result negative positive. positive, PTO continues test negative again. Constantly storing 50 rolls toilet paper asinine. would emulate idiotic behavior? go local ER. Test came back negative. Even insurance deductible met already year $1600 bill. one day brother Right. believe talking snakes garden Eden...not science facts. False positive bad say cannot get sick stuff spreading disease soon enough spike still coming COVID slow show people get tested contact tracing happening like anywhere level should. actually much worse 5 months ago really way get back control Federal leadership note sources mention cases schoolchildren seem transmit. However, seem far between, mostly associated adolescents rather young children. zero-fucks generation. Oh yeah, winning since 2017! summed ignorant, stupid hateful Trumps voters look. Sigh. length immunity, well strength immunity, question sure, though worth noting found people SARS STILL strong immune response 17 years later.

Also account things like cross immunity Coronaviruses well.

My personal guess probably closer 60 million cases 40 Million Unfortunately politics become polarizing sides seem want say, ‘I’m right, fucking idiot’, instead getting together putting special interest side solve problems. We, nation, need done partisan politics remember brothers sisters linked other’s fates. Trump done great job much anything besides working rug his, venom directed would better converted positive action. bad that’s unlikely happen unless run politicians town good. US population 5 times larger UK, increase UK cases proportionately get 2000-4000. it’s something like 20 times worse US. Also cases deaths UK consistently declining months now. point claims UK attitude accurate. don’t really know compared much Reddit, attitude Covid could hardly different UK. overwhelming majority population took seriously full lockdown people complied brought cases way down. clock now. I'll get back u this. think people previous generations would held better virus attacking brain via...the power macho stoicism? ongoing mistake need correction. story information? And? still insufficient, correct?  supposed quarantine waiting results tests. Assume positive hear sure. think need widespread info campaign this; lot people seem understand part testing. schools actually thinking implementing talking exception cubicles obviously. Classes split half, 1st half attends school monday/thursday, 2nd half attends school tuesday/friday, wednesday deep cleaning day along saturday. kids school watching home. course teachers ones getting hosed here

School complex perfect solution hopes make safe find way accommodate many people can. honestly know help teachers feel safe though unless make plexi glass wall around teaching area.

From talking teachers area difficult thing kids get correct support home whether neglectful parents working parents can't help child's homework. kids going left behind one help difficult assignments unless leave 5th grader reach teachers help. applies companies 500 employees though Heartless twat Gotta libtards/s

Trump proof overarching mentality Republican party. think ever much like ""quoting"". civil war that's still litigated among populous. test July 2nd, second July 14th.

To answer last question, yes. honest? don’t think us really accepts things are, system brain ignores ”unimportant information” biased since might find unimportant actually important. 

Maybe kind people would accept reality ”forced” it? drug LSD aside giving trippy visuals also inhibits system start see things actually influenced think them. good way describe would start seeing whole picture part like look at. Like thought good looking reality you’re average even ugly? quick glance mirror LSD would break illusion rather quickly. personal example would first trip LSD made realize eating meat wrong.

People call phenomenon ego disollution there’s also something called ego death said complete ”loss self” happens high doses. Pretty cool stuff read makes wonder would happen everyone world started tripping time lol see next year look much people died compared average last years. think that’s way tell now, testing capacity overwhelmed US. looks like we're still studying now, simple search found still hobbled severe viral infection struck March left coughing months ago, 28-year-old environmental researcher United Kingdom, road friends band toured venues French thing didn’t anticipate virus seems accelerate great deal scarring lungs. lung tissue replaced scar tissue, longer functional regular pulmonary tissue, translates poor gas exchange. really fear long-term shortness breath could extend anywhere mild severely limiting. also disturbing report looking computerized tomography (CT) scans asymptomatic people found left scar tissue.

yeah thanks telling time possibly die far I'm concerned, [this final word graph). see stable trend deaths last 3 years. see covid affecting this. Anyone thinks deaths exaggerated needs explain extra deaths coming from.

What need patent renewal reform reasonable limits cost, medical communism. definitely don’t see bigger picture. directly impacts them, don’t understand. statistics, Finns Swedes avoid wearing masks most. 83 per cent Finns 85 per cent Swedes say never used mask public places.
In UK, half never used mask, 19 per cent say always wear one outside home.

I think actually wrong Danes wear least: 88% wear according [source article I've heard said many Finns often give much thought goes Denmark maybe oversight example that. 

Anyway, anti-mask sentiment strong throughout whole Nordic region. probably comes small ""c"" conservatism feel necessary now. said, public health agencies region mostly blame since recommend them, public would probably fall line. *all* ignore pretty much settled science mystery.

Mah freedumbs, doh! guys done de-railing thread? 16 people infected, 17 total. 6 adults (3 couples probably) 11 kids sounds fake. thought poor people poverty direct result laziness, zero compounding  Nobody saying risk though - rewards seem significantly outweigh risks schools. testing staff issue, good hygiene cleaning work spaces help protect staff.

This 3 days slower last week, rate spread slowed slightly.

See [this post formula Realistically many. made news unlikely. It'll still lead increased infections deaths though. That's pretty much certainty.

In Europe, countries tightening mask collections due rising infection rates. research evidence extensive use masks would reduce infections.

The hesitation governments mask policy may also influenced people’s mask enthusiasm.

Initially, governments reluctant impose mask packs provide good mouth-nose protection health care workers, Lavoie, interviewed BBC, estimates.
Conflicting messages usefulness masks made people hesitant use them.

In Finland, government decided early June issue official recommendations use masks. companies, Finnair, outlined use masks themselves.

The Department Health Welfare (THL) says website cloth masks prevent spread droplets, misused even increase risk infection.

According THL, surgical face masks prevent spread virus better cloth masks, reserved healthcare use.

#The example matters, experts estimate. That’s Trump Johnson’s appearances masks important.

Robert Redfield, director U.S. Center Infectious Diseases, said interview medical publication U.S. infection situation would go away month two everyone wore masks.

Redfield said saddened politicization masks, public health issue.

The tsunami disaster. Forest fires. corona pandemic.


Extensive commissions reviews following national crises pointed similar problems.

- general hope learn something, says Per Molander, general secretary disaster commission 2004 tsunami chairman equality commission, soon submit final report.

The possibility political system learn shortcomings failures corona crisis ""decently good"", believes.

- always temptation exploit crises politically. general, political system relatively humble face crisis.

The pandemic permeates entire society, well entire Swedish administrative system.

- important overall issue division responsibilities state, region municipality. brought fore crisis many ways. state perceived many invisible, says Molander.

But mean government state authorities made fundamental mistakes, points out.

- system looks like. seen disadvantages decentralization before.

In Sweden, 21 regions, bears operational responsibility healthcare. 290 municipalities responsible elderly care.

- optimistic believe operational responsibility normal circumstances also able plan unusual challenges, says Molander.

Similar problems highlighted connection major forest fires 2018.

- Sweden sufficiently equipped cope large forest fires disasters. overall point view, says Jan-Åke Björklund, led state investigation fires.

The rescue services fought put fires faced challenges stretched across municipal boundaries, placed sudden demands coordination higher governance.

- decentralized society works well everyday life. crises, clear take command. problems territories downpipes organizations. want step other's toes.

Some forest fires fought effectively others.

- worked, large rescue services MSB stepped forward taken command, despite fact may lacked authority, says Björklund.

Expert authorities responsible know-how, Swedish Public Health Agency. government always ultimately responsible leading crisis, points Inga-Britt Ahlenius, former member commission inquiry Palme Inquiry.

- decentralized management model places demands center strong capable governing. think government show corona pandemic, says.

The impression instead Public Health Agency taken command, Ahlenius believes
.
- government's responsibility strike balance different sectors interests authorities. Denmark Norway, instead seen prime ministers personified government's authority.

In Disaster Commission, appointed 2004 tsunami, Government Offices' organization received scathing criticism failed crisis management.

- Large parts Swedish people better informed tsunami government, lacked sufficient external monitoring, says Molander.

In final report, Disaster Commission proposed crisis organization built Government Offices.

- set report still exists. Prime Minister's Committee many years, moved Ministry Justice.

Ahlenius again:

- opinion, wrong, crisis management, subordinate Prime Minister. However, unproblematic crisis management team without day-to-day operational responsibility.

The great scientific uncertainties completely new virus complicate decision-making. difficult constitutional nut crack Corona Commission, Molander believes.

- required something innovative. government acted agreement administrative structure around political agreement. question one ask whether right structure.

#Facts: Corona Commission

And on. I'm sure complicated you. Unfortunately reddit option could write crayon you. limited testing India infected/death totals nowhere near accurate.

-apparently Americans 1k first time months yesterday. yes obviously decrease death rate good news. Yeah, doesn’t seem like “Karen” situation someone deeply troubled. People likely donate less average neighbors watching put money collection plate. reasonable question.

*If* Florida's 10k cases per day 10% true total (and that's big if, testing way better four months ago) then, population 21M 380k confirmed cases we're already 18% infected, perhaps 10M 100 days go herd immunity.

However, 10x ratio massive assumption one I'd huge amount faith in. ratio drops 3x we're 5% infected 30k/day, means we're year away herd immunity even still strong enough immune response within period.  assume anywhere go people it, stay fuck away anyone.

Which isn’t necessarily wrong parties somewhat screwing everyone over. doesn’t even compare though Democrats Republicans. clear lesser two evils Democrat party, they’re party doesn’t squash dissent unify around core set beliefs - makes open ideas also less effective political force. 

Most Americans don’t pay attention details. example probably aren’t aware PPP loans (their tax money) meant small businesses absolutely plundered large corporations due Republican wording bill. teach less involved moderate friends almost every time discuss Trump’s pandemic failure. They’re aware less important shit like Trump’s latest gaffe - media focuses on. Gaffes easily brushed away anti-Trump hysteria people ignore blatant corruption going behind curtains.

Capitalism: tell anyone make it! tell works everyone can't make it.

I mostly greenest category, member household 99.9% green category. However, 2 3 days per week, 2nd-highest risk category (I go office). However, office, lot attempt mitigate risk:

* 95% time private office, alone.

* vent door closed window open.

* times I'm common areas, wear N95 KN95.

* never private office another person.

* wash hands every time outside office, really probably far frequently. people would sanitize, wash possible.

* sanitize hands high-touch surfaces every time get car.

My office access controlled, generally socially distance okay. contact general public. tons sanitizer, building occupancy limited. knowledge, nobody office contact virus. downside, one wears mask indoors. Plus see social media coworkers distancing/masking outside office.

Anybody got ideas reduce risk days must office? feel terribly at-risk; I'm alone almost time I'm common areas, I'm properly masked. 1,926 cases appallingly low 8,005 tests positivity rate 24.1%.

Not that, largely hippyish either. People leftist views often view ""the progressive state""...no, that's somewhere else (Hawaii, Oregon, Washington maybe?)...living here, personally consider neoliberal state.

The hit job right-wing done California blows mind, far taxation concerned advice would check actual numbers saying high taxation state, progressive taxation tax brackets work way think do.

Progressive taxation (IMO correctly) targets high wage earners regular working people.

For (or maybe even most) households, taxed ""low tax"" states state local take fixed % paycheck. East Asia would like word lmfao. Yup got test results 1-2weeks. dick big deal Apparently write everything says officially brilliant wise person alive don’t want miss it.

Research shows exact opposite. unlikely get surfaces. shes alive! reliance low skill job means gets put others risk? joke. Okay Karen single death tragedy. million deaths statistic.

We'll cross 150,000 deaths sometime next week. yet we're still talking ""when open movie theaters"" ""should school hybrid next year open completely?""

COVID completely politicized administration. People longer looking medical science data, they're lining along political lines. I'm willing estimate politicization COVID Executive Branch end costing 200,000 lives top would seen simply said ""quarantine makes sense, let's wear masks stay away other"". could done short-order, long-haul.

You're equation. No. way passing judgement impoverished person shows idea reality living tough choices make order survive. assured daughter Dick Cheney knows well doing.  wouldn’t rule bid 2024. getting onto national stage. saying see. 🥳 really know many times need say this.

NOBODY saying children spread virus - much lower rates. age range experts say children 15/16 spread significantly less. vast majority school children. Honestly, wouldn’t take way. definitely trust Cuomo, staff proven us they’re trying best. need give degrees freedom greater side numbers (for example, report 5,000 cases, chances more, that’s cases *confirmed*). don’t know scope virus yet America, need keep eye numbers general rule “increasing/decreasing” adjust plan accordingly.

Is common US? 

By Anubis’ wrath. wonder guys can’t control there. US northeast starting see second wave, way states really able keep control virus keeping stuff closed.


In US, dont think able open without spiking without vaccine. mean, currently seeing PA. data date, Mar. 15 June 6 USA might underreported 21,400 Covid-19 deaths. found psych experiment discusses 2yos formed identity around preferring grahn crackers green beans. liked doll claimed preferences. also thought one dolls punished liking green beans. supportive evidence, I'm arguing observations backed science. that's makes sense me. find arguments stupidity entitlement explain intense anger people feel around masks coming *one particular culture others.* 

**Every culture stupid, stubborn, entitled people.** (almost) exclusively specific identity fighting retail clerks regarding mask order. What's going there? can't pretend groups also idiots therefore know value masks. There's cultural identity happening here. I'd open ideas sure. I’m like four months past due molar extraction. Lol, don’t want abscess get first . . taking amoxicillin cephalexin tests did, cases found per day. Daddy Trump told slow testing down. people see 9k positive instead 15k think it’s better, despite fact positivity rates still ridiculously high. Nothing really better, sadly. told 1/1000th number lies virus President? seems playbook. work places handling horrendously. 

And GOP way, employers released liability related irresponsible actions crisis. Florida seeing testing capacity shortage testing starting go lower. 

Someone mentioned yesterday r/FloridaCoronavirus less people going test. link comment: thought I'd let know: Private clinic, Pasco, testing less patients coming testing. 100+ nearly every day past weeks. we're around 50-60 per day. think test result wait time discouraging everyone testing. However - insurances notified customers cover cost testing, even private clinics, may see resurgence testing numbers soon.  According friend works Florida DoH testing backlog ginormous.

The reagents use testing run low, federal testing sites closing/have closed. limiting amount testing lack test kit reagents essentially. public transit riders black here. made enter crowd rear buses stay clear drivers. social distancing attainable. I'd love see Rosa Parks try sit front. Well anyone brain knows that's lie

You're assuming supporters brain Oh please. wealthy propaganda machines everything make sure shit stays broken. Dark view: time get vaccine, we'll need 100 million doses, we'll 220 million case mark.

Light view: that's first tranche, likely vulnerable populations/health care workers. There's apparently options 500M doses total. Median age death 78 years old...that's literally median death age virus hit us. Oh sweet summer child :P HEB throughout TX, people using it.  sure. roughly 50% time, 30% home delivery 20% store things listed online. kniw people using it. Maybe 5 dollar upcharge. article link say England likely follow Denmark's footsteps, think highly likely Wales, Scotland etc. well. idea did, article may.

It also seems likely eurpean countries same. understand it’s always convenient, far safest option. I’m student last thing would want spread peers, teachers, family Trump re-elected doubt it.  tragedy grief kids........and go street store today motherfuckers without mask look story say face fake. adjust admission criteria, send patients back nursing homes, cancel elective surgeries preserve beds last sentence wrong.

The vaccination tetanus stimulates antibody production lasts 11 years. significant difference antibody concentration tetanus disease vaccinated tetanus, get tetanus booster every ten years so. 

Antibodies Sars-CoV2 coronaviruses last 6 month year. We're unlikely able produce vaccine Sars-CoV2 immunity lasts months. Maybe got problems own. Quit bitching. Work hard quit asking people help you. thing even pr altruism anything.

It MAKES SENSE protect bread butter, workforce, let damn thing spread it.

I believe problem even greed putting money people (except cases laborors discarded replaced new laborors large pool uninfected candidates, even long last?). problem seems far wide people believe big deal. is. 🤦‍♀️ study recovered patients mild symptoms disease. correlate amount antibodies generated vaccination? known severe cases disease induce higher antibody count. 

Also, antibodies going away main concern vaccine induce cell-mediated inmune response. vaccine generates ""double protection"" (both antibodies cells) problem antibodies going away would mitigated.

We also information yet effect memory cells (B-Type Lynphocites) re-infection. respond quickly presence coronavirus? generate antibodies fight infection symptoms start? Even patient start presenting symptoms, likely develop severe case Covid-19? know mild moderate cases disease successfully treated right now. thats good news! It’s decision, it’s prediction. harsh, rough, valid prediction

Unfortunately, barring really questionable tactics (see: welding people inside homes), can’t actually force people things, agree them.

As much hate think way, study study shown human beings, willpower, resolve, plain old fucks give finite. It’s seige warfare, guerilla war, protests strikes work. goal run side mental resources do, cave demands.

Some things increase resources. Strong leadership. cohesive message. Support (emotional, fiscal, etc). sense community. united moral imperitive. Fear.

We none those. although fear, human brain *fucking awful* weighing risks statistical risks long periods. brains wired “this Bear trying kill me” “if don’t get food tomorrow die”, “am putting 0.1% risk infection going outside today” “is cheeseburger going take one statistical day lifespan”

It’s hide basement thunderstorm chugging soda.

Without things, biological supply adrenaline exhausted, country resources another lockdown.

That doesn’t mean shouldn’t it. doesn’t mean virus doesn’t demand it. means squandered resources option table. that’s good thing. specific business still restricted mean others reopening.

The reopening businesses relaxing guidelines causing current increase.

How sit lie saying things opening up? I'm due October 6th. conceive January kept trying. tell friends 0/10 would recommend pandemic pregnancy. prescribed anti anxiety medicine, sure I'm going take it, doctor said patients anxiety time high. second pregnancy I'm lucky I'm missing first time mom joys like shower 10s learn development skills like communication emotional understanding home. Children learn early years. easy say think single parents need work balance childcare - households access multiple computers. 

Home schooling widens inequality. OLD NEWS, G variant spread throughout Europe US since spring. I'm person responded I'm industry well far I'm aware, one pooled samples public testing US; samples correspond single person. Mainly currently people suspected exposed tested pooled batch almost guaranteed positive rate high right now, would re-test everyone individually anyway. individual testing thing makes sense now.

There companies pursuing pooled testing method employees (not companies developing covid-19 tests, companies operating want ability quickly determine anyone it) where, say, 50 samples pooled run positive sequester test person individually. issue cost, interpretation, turnaround time. Places nothing diagnostic testing trying figure get infrastructure in-house, hire workers conduct tests vet different testing platforms. I'm giving example type place, though I'm speaking direct experience know this, think someplace like Walmart Target online order fulfillment they're high volumes workers many shifts lots people working space. want able know sick ASAP.

I'll honest, whole scenario sounds dystopian think many types places willing pay livable wage fine spending millions tens millions dollars viral testing mainly alleviate liabilities. Asian American wonder what'll happen displaced rage starts disproportionately start effect people maybe start fearing life. Particularly someone's constant 'China Virus' relabeling incites xenophobia.

6,900 BIGGER number 2,000. Going less rate hospitalizations

Now getting somewhere. rate hospitalizations per confirmed case down. overall hospitalizations, 350%, grown less quickly confirmed cases. 

As that, biggest difference probably number tests. Back earlier, testing widespread available. People hospitals received priority testing, would overrepresent hospitalized covid cases compared overall population. 

In addition that, factors like:

-Arizona sending hospital patients New Mexico room,

-Some hospitals clearing non-covid hospital patients make room covid patients, using stricter standards admissions,

-and hardest-hit areas basically hit ceiling hospitalization numbers numbers longer go up. SAYS positive. known liar nobody knows really Put mask one exist bats... like vaccinating bats...  Rich countries, think, get relatively close eradication there's political intent so.

This going totally depend efficacy vaccines. reduces symptoms common cold, still infectious, we're going issues vulnerable nursing homes (people vaccines always work with).

Like Santa Clara, USC, Miami studies indicated 0.001% IFR - ramping number positives factor 1,000.

The 3% Indiana always felt high me, never published antibody test used. Indiana 2500 deaths late may per [excess though. 1% IFR would around 3.6% state infected. 1.5% IFR would 2.4% state infected. far sanity check gives.

""Oh NY, Jersey"" confirmed. people heightened immune response [thanks particular gene Black Plague killed many Europeans fundamentally changed DNA. Unless incredibly creative counting/reporting way it’s 300k Election Day. Statewide, new hospitalizations increasing. Although entirely clear, think article specifically talking Central Florida area. 3 people age 63,57 30 COVID positive. Tablets prescribed 1) calcitrol,calciumcitrate zinc 2 times day
2) Doxycycline lactic acid bacillus 2 times day
3)Mefenamic acid paracetamol tablets ( fever ) 4) Dexamethasone 4mg ( 2 times day ) 5) Antiflu (only cough there)

Is okay? Anything doc missing??  Yeah, consider **extremely** fortunate, employer paying 100% copays costs associated healthcare anything COVID-19 related.

Unfortunately, people likely need kind support aren’t likely work software company. Likely much 300K. Third time. second time make wear mask. needs hug kiss trump. Yes let's say example antibody test positive virus symptoms within past 2 months.

That would exclude huge number positive cases people either symptoms 2 months ago. point 6-7 months pandemic would lot.

I think needs explanation certain hard-hit areas like NY, NJ, Italy seeing resurgence even re-opening. wonder lot people got thought, like way more, maybe enough herd immunity. maybe people naturally immune? didn’t address specific questions food agriculture, husbandry, intermediary steps, ultimate distribution (within imagined 10-mile radius transportation), electricity, sanitation. justify absolutely farcical idea cram 300 million people (i.e. US population) (whatever arbitrary measure cities choose employ). 

Beyond that, transportation hubs connect remote areas city centers already exist. 100 mi commutes cities basic supplies highly unusual first place. 

I’m wholly support public transportations there’s reason jump sloppily arranged hoops argue superiority - doesn’t address numerous shortfalls herding people onto Kowloon Walled City-type environments. merely redirects conversation.   Even daily death rates higher neighbors

The relative rate higher, absolute number deaths essentially same. Google it, last 4 days you’ll find 0-1 deaths per day Norway 1-3 deaths per day Sweden. different approaches, essentially absolute number deaths. Roger. Thanks. Yeah, laid work nuts. laid 60% department. people left indicated cut projects, fact, added 60% less people. 🤣🤣 even read post...

I said OP post anything hope Sweden hate (because fall line).

""You"" perfect example referring to.

You know anything Sweden... read post article.  apoplectic hate Sweden thought saw opportunity pounce.

""You"" what's wrong people today. Wednesday night party night /s first thought, seeing photo children, obesity. 

that's fair, seemed like wrote seem match thought. anyone know: grandma hospice NC. 

The director told mom, COVID hospice allowed come twice week hour each. 

Which really make sense also, mean people getting appropriate end life care? Like said Mid August death minimum case say least. 

Lol, bet ages well. Give exact number “told so” later. Mark words free distributed fairly... day vaccine comes demand vastly outweigh supply way products ever before. say 1 million day 1 (rosy estimate) globally billions people wanting one honestly expect happen? supply catches demand expect wealthy well connected eat up. Personally - belief almost never visit sub people respond well - believe SARS-2 already mild enough virus could live life without artificial slowing spread totally fine societal level. (Exceptions care taken elderly care facilities aka nursing homes, course, I'm talking general population here).

How mesh overwhelmed ICUs, though? No. proper vaccine people actually using probably get size diseases pertains importance every day life. may wear masks LOOOOONG time tho works Germany seem degree respect expertise.

Conversely also degree shame exists America seems completely bereft of.

We ashamed stupid. Moreover, anybody claims exercise expertise authority put down. 

America societal problem. don’t need many active cases, cure. need healthy population.

In fact, you’re risking getting false results population endemic spread especially many asymptomatic detectable time administering vaccine. might test positive virus (or antibodies) shortly after, would impact observation.

It would make sense vaccinate people Beijing example, especially working imported meat industry travel staff serving highly infected international destinations. ""You seen single high profile individual die Corona past months. ""

Talks 4+ months ago honestly watch much news. try find multiple places get info read lines. seen whole FL thing tho? another link somewhere else place question skewed numbers.  i'm assuming would data security issues also. 

but aside that, countries trust whatever answer china gives? russia? US? country declares random plant cure, many believe them? etc 

just like BoJo got sick, there's way england would risked taking someone else's answer China, people ain't hardly got nothin'...

No possessions? mean, make sense weigh risks though. completely novel vaccine isn’t risk free proposition. 

It’s symptoms we’re finding COVID think risky. depends writes them. Trump Trumpism win flourish, right. Otherwise, sane people take back control we'll looked back horror. thought loved :( Yes, am. Anything need help mathematically? sounds like show Big Love....minus sister-wives. Maturity table wear diapers. Oh yes, that’s it’s always worked. ever another peak though strategy proven wrong. scandi countries catch sweden's death rate, sweden proven right.

I totally agree. *this* decline occurred? Wow. Never thought I'd say fully understand vaccination that. scumbag move. need either. virus could literally disappear tomorrow forever traces sub would still find way negative it. No. still running around saying it’s cold. fair, it’s loud 30-40% Americans that. may likely impossible anything like ever happen again. world continues become smaller smaller, happens believe see fewer fewer nations. able thread needle survive civilization past point one nation rules entire globe entirely possible could see worldwide achievements like this. They're wasting precious hydroxychloroquine non-human primates!??! I'm essential work site dealing working insane amounts overtime. actually really helpful gave something got paid. realize everyone can't though. Probably higher. False negative results consequential, infected persons — might asymptomatic — may isolated infect preprint systematic review five studies (not including Yang Zhao studies), involving 957 patients (“under suspicion Covid-19” “confirmed cases”), false negatives ranged 2 anyone article posted days ago Texas field hospital literally ants crawling ICU patients? post appears gone can't find anything via Google. Yea sue Nothing Democrats instead? Pretty much everyone eats without mask. wonder he's given convalescent antibodies. goes trump, one talking possibility? made drs give hydroxychloroquine would taking something actually works relatively benign it? ones pleading following CDC guidelines asking mandatory face masks/shut downs.
The rest loving resistance, ""Murica! Mah rights! HOAX!"" they're, well, literally stupid consequently gullible five year old.  Woooow took long realize president IIRC researchers working vaccine developed two variations different vectors avoid problem (administer one person vaccinated lower resistance).  NYC data suggests 1.2% fatality rate (when including confirmed + probable deaths) sick end march, still can't sleep back, still get excessively tired days (though assume due poor sleep), heart races randomly, feel pulse arotic artery try lay down... shit's fucked. good applauded far I'm concerned, there's little enforcement corner state one already effect weeks (LE area told folks take Health Department). doubt sadly going change much anything overall. would never say this. Even know you, assume lovely, nice important human being. think Sexuality thing important fullfill needings. supress imo healthy. antibody titers gone Memory B cells gone

Your links say nothing this. host vulnerable reinfection again.

Reinfection yes. reason believe disease mild subsequent infections, provided immune system healthy. Taiwan? island, hard. New Zealand too. reason.

Germany surrounded Luxembourgh, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, Poland, Slovakia, Czechia, Austria, probably forgot one.  Gold medalist mental gymnastics. public schools, colleges different areas - going stay closed either They're sensitive people.     
But I'm actually surprised there's thread. Trouble situation person office concerns all. entire organization anti-mask/just flu bro. rural area/community/county way, save handful I've seen local FB page always get vitriol max. Livin' bizarro world!  math correct ignoring significant variables.


You're randomly selecting two individuals every person 100% equivalent chance catching disease. know that's true. partner someone catches disease likely going increased risk contracting themselves. 


Additionally others pointed single parent home needs one adult die.


If factor adults kids person school increased risk exposure well might see yet another increase final orphan tally.


Lastly, although I'm sure more, cases clustered evenly distributed across population. stands reason partners exposed likely interacting population. seems like first little different. chance catching partner live area 50% infection rates (exaggeration simplify math) parent individually 50% chance catching it. Meaning higher 50% chance least one get it. I'd need source user intuition now, one gets sick likely will.

Tl;dr math wrong also oversimplifying. math needs make assumption entire population equally likely become infected. use straight death numbers. math would useful using death rates specific community predict many orphans be. also use specific community death/infection rates. exactly. i’m advocating people get infected they’re immune, saying there’s enough sound research either side make definite claim that’s absolutely zero medical professionals made claim.

regardless you’re “immune” body going better prepared fight virus off. California getting pretty well total population dense cities past month so. Probably they're doctors know better. reason Dr. McDougall's system works he's removing Omega 6 fatty acids highly inflammatory. Here's main problem, replaced stable saturated fats highly oxidized delicate Polyunsaturated fatty acids. use vegetable seed oils cook, break highly oxidized trans fats heated. McDougall causation without correlation. high carb removal fats solving problem, removal omega 6 fats helps bring omega 3 omega 6 ratio check. proven time time true effective way reverse type 2 diabetes strict high fat low carb diet. Diabetes related insulin resistance. Carbohydrates cause greatest spike insulin. eat high carb diet consistently spike insulin, become insulin resistance. different drug addict develops resistance drug use. Fat causes almost insulin response thus stop spiking insulin, insulin sensitivity increases eventually cures type 2 diabetes.

It's amazing many people push idiotic studies like Dr. McDougall's. I've read studies poorly controlled. studies basically like taking someone eats ton cheeseburgers pizzas processed foods making assertion fat diet causing heart disease, meanwhile completely ignoring sugar processed carbs/processed foods individual eating. f Go Corona! comments.  Im well, time come make fun guys 

Oof really sad sentence. Hope figure soon bud.  everyone around got sick ill end December. Me, mother, father, young son, mother, one good friends. tested positive antibodies June. ex tested negative twice May even though could sworn must due seriousness illness. Here’s thing though... she’s always extremely weak immune system several ongoing health issues prone couple really bad viruses year. personally barely ever fall ill. Could people retain strong antibodies can’t. that's I've mentioned all. said anything pushing something through. I'm saying companies getting payments whether vaccines pass not. antibodies result immunity, yes. literally say things posts. Like said, good day! Sure, I'll sort shit out! oh yeah want refillable pod system. One thing noticed juul pretty finicky, especially get bubbles near wicks, take pretty huge hits it, way bigger cigarette that's sure, took getting used figured how, take pod lot tap get bubbles out. think brother actually caliburn koko. think I'm going get one, they're price juul anyway. main reason went juul could buy pods convenience store. Yeah I'm sure drive roads build call fire dept house fire get bucket instead. weaponized variants went missing collapse Soviet union believe. could totally wrong.

Troops still get vaccinated reason. Could understand indoors, outdoors still big question mark even pro mask people. know pushback one NJ outdoor part it. Doubt gets enforced much indoor one. think part issue impressing people importance long term complications seems happening small portion people get virus. know several people 60's it, sick couple days felt fine two weeks felt fine since. I've read people long term issues seems around 1% people get sick continuing problems. might seem insignificant, consider millions already already gotten COVID US millions get - 1% quite high terms total people knock out. novel virus need alert, could even impact everyone longterm understand yet. Therefore significantly less likely die, point. bullshitting Covid, reinforce point. Building data estimate scale spread point useful.

There problems throwing amount money solve faster. far Republicans minority country. They're really good suppressing voters ruling minority position.

Remember, last two Republican presidents (Bush Trump) **lost popular vote**. Republicans accept ""our country **Republic**, **Democracy**."" Dewine issued mask mandate! America bad  He’s definitely getting convalescent plasma infusions well Remdesivir best care treatments. wealthy powerful benefits.  New York different beast, little testing back then. 30K dead matter couple months. true numbers probably millions. Therefore significantly less likely die, point. supposed provide that? law state that? Define ""security"". Take look courts, covered already.

You're idealistic. people street. 1000 people inside Costco walking around 20 people restaurant what’s causing spikes? death rate down, we’re curb. Surprisingly, evidence lockdowns effect spikes pretty skanty. human beings careful. People started staying home wearing masks mandatory. Hey doomers numbers Texas stabilizing say? Like said Mid August death minimum case say least. Maybe mask helped didn’t need shut like many predicted. Exponential growth big lie! Thanks people I'm working wearing masks despite rule. I've already brought once, bring today. One ladies tried tell follows Dr. Drew Pinsky knows many people got spread anyone. 

I'm go HR shit. Fuck people. live vulnerable people communicated people work with. ? bad comment? research literally internet confirm. Flu/strep tests first things I'm given go sinus infections.... even telling sinus infection lol  live Florida seen lot people get virus. know 12 people friends, family, co workers acquaintances. 12 one “bad case” 70 year old uncle. fully recovered however. 11 ranged symptoms mild symptoms couple days.  must depend tracker using. often cited Worldometers show New York 436,379 California 413,576. New York still 23,000 ahead, California overtake 3 days. Florida 379,619 Texas 357,127. Confirmed numbers states pass New York too. REAL cases, however, NY's numbers much undercounted others back March/April testing capabilities anywhere near now. believe state ever pass NY's 32,609 deaths. Many low wage employers awful too. Try take two weeks you’re sick, don’t job go back to. hard say population density really important. Sure NYC got hit hard second dense city l, San Francisco didn’t.

Also internationally many extremely dense countries like Japan Korea fine. Yea, rely Brazilian media.... country allows gene modification fetuses, pet cloning sterilization minorities? (I’m even starting borderline crazy stuff happened outbreak)

I’m sure ethics part least concerns. mean that’s always stance, leave stuff states. ever actively masks wearing one pandemic ? infectious supposedly stomach symptoms young people haven’t seen one study suggesting infectious months. anything, there’s many disproving that. looking good, guess. Stay safe. think he/she meant public. ""When twist math way, ignore everything else, says""

ok buddy stay uneducated estimates many people stay home recover own. live OC, county report 6PM PST, LA county. can’t nice things  American Healthcare free pharma stuffs?

The conspiracies became plausible. meanwhile, France, 998 cases deaths NY mostly NYC. NY much higher population density France. Like much compact French major cities.

California also higher population density France. 

Idk Texas. ""A-holes ARDS"" cut testing almost half it’s still terrible. Lol really typical American. Well fun catching covid, going bankrupt paying it, know rest world laughing can't stand yourselves. That’s awesome! hiring, I’m RN hospital near kind. get test results back quicker, use time wait. dead grandpa got stimulus check (and death properly reported post-mortem taxes properly paid 2018 passed). 

But still sent (republican) corpse check. care stimulus dead republicans lives claim began conception. I'm construction. One guy crew got it, didnt spread anybody. Instead praising masks, social distancing, guidelines put go work (I'm complaining them, takes lot longer things), everyone attributes ""immune systems, eating right, taking care ourselves."" 

I want ask much pizza, beer, cigarettes consume home, see firsthand shows dont eat right, treat bodies right, nothing. 100% believe would gotten without social distancing measures mask wearing. saying UK example country locked successfully fought virus using herd immunity? one highest death rates per capita world? *Shure*, actually best consideration! everybody underlying conditions stay away public transportation. Denmark must indeed theme park solidarity itself. said! “Consent” one party position power isn’t really consent, it’s coercion. Ask around see many workers actually job voluntary basis, vs it’s option part limited set options alternative starvation homelessness. starters, natural supplements used adjunct therapies. Something putting money LONG time ago! ! Also. Diet. “eat healthy diet” foods inhibit growth corona viruses?  frontline workers better protect besides masks hand washing?  Drinking water? Bathing lavender? Hell, don’t know. existing research build on. fucking “lots corona cases” studies. Wrong comment bud. I'm vegetarian. 

There lots ways classify evil. poor leader allows people die one. disease become endemic without vaccine, too. That's bad thing, becomes another bug floats around. Even there's reinfection, unlikely second infection would worse first, time, could become another version common cold. im talking resturant concept like 15% us, scientist estimating 65% survivors permanent health conditions.   say toxic. I'm going sit pretend either side best talking either.

Just look sub. many people here, right now, see go ""mask casket"" shoce latest Karen video faces? many downvotes someone else get message even slightly questions anything majority believe? story Newsweek Costco guy ended mob contact job get fired outburst? REALLY showing safety, push something else can't exactly explain yet? can't answer one question without saying someone care thinking worst them?

Seriously, freaked said subsection side acting toxic horrible. side still made human beings capable acting way. think there's way happen? FWIW Newsome openly criticizes Trump time time CDC longer getting current numbers. data least 30 days old. Though may talking two different numbers. number based cased admitted hospital.   Well everyone see pictured simply selfish asshole. 

I got called sheep letting media make wear mask. I've never heard media tell wear mask... started wearing one March drs CDC told to. Even Republican governor president recommend it. So... There's that. 

They want separate counter whatever everyone else saying. yeah ppl things - they're meeting want to. risk tolerance, like commenter said. feel comfortable with? know lot virus - want meet someone, ask steps take mitigate risk. go overboard, small simple steps go long way. seen family members outside 6 ft apart seems safe me. might never effective vaccine - never going see family again? make decision balancing protecting virus protecting mental health connections others, especially loved ones. That’s precise things doomers good doing. Lmao even GET unemployment period time. Hell MD unemployment website &amp; system fucked COVID, well post -COVID, fuggedaboutit. Good, maybe understand pain inflicted others... kidding, he's fucking cunt. Low o2 sat awake talking normally. Bewildered docs. like 3 hours later dead. Meowy meowy poo poo pee pee mask mandate mean anything unless willing enforce it. said, went large chain mandating masks middle day yesterday pleasantly surprised nobody removed entering store. neighbor still literally huffing 2 packs day lol. Picks blows nose without tissue, touches door knobs. Goes everyday. He's still going good. Guess people luck lets punish residents two feuding morons? Big closets. genuinely jealous sad time Vapes help quit smoking smoked two years like pack week, really say addicted? dropped vape today gonna see long this..I feel like vape hurt cigs.. Pfizer manufacturing drug tested Germany. Vaccines incredibly safe. lots problems Pfizer. vaccine shouldn’t be.  See comment below. Good news! Holcomb mandated mask wearing state! much hope people following order, hopefully change. took trump saying good governors fall line common sense. Also Russia still samples, China whoever could potentially steal smallpox Russian US lab breed labs.

Or someone could taken sample eradicated told anyone, find frozen somewhere. troops already vaccinated sorts makes sense add smallpox there, even scenario little forced.  That's reason taken extreme precautions, lungs already weak, asma sinuses always clogged. Despite love walk jog run. 

If get virus, even surviving ruin lifestyle.  Using cancer bit poor example though already know rise people arent getting important check ups treatment. Perhaps took photo own, assuming photographer would done it. 60k annual flu deaths USA

About 140K deaths covid-19 6/7 months USA.

I'm sure people still say flu kills that's easily debunked. fucking annihilate comment downvotes please

Thanks, clear care downvotes numerical sense asking getting long discussions people reflexively downvote always ends waste time (I've bit many times there). Thanks much Arizona's statewide ICU capacity 85% full weeks now

This totally normal capacity, though. ICUs commonly operate ""close"" (relatively speaking) 100% capacity, fact surprised learn.

There wealth evidence Arizona Texas hit passed peak recently, situation improve two states restrictions place slow spread. closed bars limited restaurant capacity, addition theaters, concerts, sporting events, etc, closed.

Right, assumption situation would true overrun without measures, hard prove one way other.

It's clear case, general seems measures taken done little materially impact spread. reductions seem logical result increased seropositivity.

It's scope note presence T-cell cross-reactivity individuals *who never exposed SARS-1 SARS-2* suggests true herd immunity threshold around ~20% unchecked spread would quite crazy might imagine. (Note though even without findings, HIT 80% position change suppose entirely Also, ICUs staffed real people, fatigue, burn out, get sick themselves. Even ICU that's 100% capacity running sustainable level. can't expect ICU staff handle 90% full ICU months end.

Yes, think long-run fatigued burned year+ long dragged affair rather letting events naturally unfold. is, course, assuming measures we've employed truly helped reduce spread. I'm saying haven't, saying position insofar work slow spread, drag situation longer increase damage accrued via economic destabilization, lack exercise due gym closures, irrational suspension elective surgeries, decrease sunlight exposure due ""stay safe, stay home"" mantra, can't expect ICU staff handle 90% full ICU months end.

Again, ICUs actually operate quite close capacity.

I already said linked comment summarize, vast majority infections lead serious cases therefore require hospitalization. utility invasive ventilation positive incredibly high. utility presumably comes giving O2 people bad COVID-19 super severe COVID-19

Well, vegetarianism hardly ethical. fact, egg milk industries may produce *more* suffering per (animal) capita, hens squeezed last egg cows squeezed last drop milk, become economically non-profitable get passed meat industry, longer meat industry get go getting relatively *early* death. good news bad?

I'm sure there's ""progressive"" state left union honest. say progressive vs neoliberal I'm talking simply (or even primarily) taxation policy...I'm talking public policy.

There's kind hoodwink committed commentary California right-wingers.

Actuality: virus, although dangerous, generally deadly killing 2 3% infected something like 50% people asymptomatic? bad reddit tries make be. expect yall ever admit cool. people struggle find affordable housing California, need stop complaining move Ohio literally whole argument. Dont worry man. got Kush it. [DON'T MENTION Tolkien wrote *The Hobbit*, named place Bilbo lived ""Bag End"" reason. lived cul-de-sac. particular case, namely, estimating number infection population IFR number deaths, nursery homes deaths skew estimated number infections higher. said post I'll elaborate - large group people living close quarters higher percentage infections general population, especially people weak immune system. Basically, 80-year-old gramps living building old people (with common lounge room, staff servicing etc) higher chances contract COVID 80-year-old gramps living apartment. affect one's chances death per se, rise estimate number infections population whole. reason (a bunch people close quarters) outbreaks prisons can't scaled general population.

So, go crazy, ""nearly"" incapable unable wear mask whatever reason (e.g. severely autistic). cases, mask swapped face shield. (This districts.)

I SAYING REOPENING GOOD IDEA. merely explaining ""nearly."" Question: made possible morons inhabit White House? got joker answer. They're gonna try conceal much possible.

Anyone come UK able whole time.  Mr. Tegnell AKA guy always proven wrong admit mistake

Could least point mistakes he's made instead populistic vague? Lmao FUCK talking about. infection fatality rate 0.5% 1.0% 95% confidence interval. Stop spewing bullshit. someone constantly least one nicotine pouch mouth, would welcome news Guess zimbabwont wear mask Well, wouldn’t wrong spent weekend researching coronavirus face mask efficacy

Wow, full weekend? must know everything now. don’t either. obviously social interaction important people better find safer ways this. experts recommend, small group, maintain social distance wear mask. Shouldn’t problem Look works, fine. notable hospitalized patients, 72.7% pneumonia. noted showing recovery symptoms similar forms viral pneumonia. question still ""having COVID-19 leads slow recoveries potential long term damage"" ""having severe case COVID-19 leads slow recoveries potential long term damage""? top 1/3rd working class.   got 69, turn around. So...nothing changed. indoor part, unless police actually want enforce (good luck getting to), know one's going actually comply outdoor one.

Keep mind I'm masks deterrent. I'm mandates seem good faith keep public safe taking sides account instead pushed respond ""Karen"" videos put social media, reason pushed for, seemly. becomes apparent case, going see major pushback rollbacks mandates feel like got info could get felt forced angry mob science things. Universal healthcare Brazil comparable first world though. people job afford private insurance like unimed get (at least circles). shit still get flu every year suppose news know 600 much. know many barely covered anything, life problems/ emergencies could mount (think busted car/AC/etc.). really talking UK? feel like me. Admittedly, contact tracing much effective now. Thank link! much luck finding peer-reviewed studies specific America, let alone ones study Midwestern United States, link quite helpful. 

Maybe I’m looking doesn’t fully exist yet. Midwest infections took later NYC’s Ca’s. 

And you’re right NYC data showing high IFR. also explains higher quality NYC’s data suggests mortality risk elsewhere U.S. may even higher. New York City among complete reliable data COVID-19 deaths—specialists review death certificates rapidly record deaths unified electronic reporting system. reason, new estimate likely accurately reflects true higher burden death due COVID-19. Further, given likely stronger public health infrastructure healthcare systems New York City many places, higher IFR estimated new study suggests mortality risk COVID-19 may even higher elsewhere United States, likely countries well. ...

I live Midwestern metropolitan city state data isn’t nearly effed as, say,
Florida’s, quality considered *lower upper half US states.

edit: *correct “lower upper half” damn, guess I’m pretty lucky. I’ve basically gone gym pretty frequently (wearing face mask course) tried best sanitizing equipment using them. Decided get tested flew back trip Yellowstone commercial plane basically full. got test result today saying I’m negative COVID-19 underestimate power bully pulpit, especially supporters fence sitters. would still refusers, would fringes normalized. 

A nationwide mask ordinance would given immediate cover businesses instead patchwork mess seen.

Unfortunately, think right passed point national lockdown working again. opportunity, 1/3 - 1/2 way basically wasted lockdown. Much world opening back up, US still barely starting gate. lot fundies view politics religion one.

Your religion greatest need get everyone follow going save going hell, vote people whose stated ethics match religion says going save people hell. life far, far less important eternity spend heaven hell, religion says make sure many people going heaven possible, need act live like you, since god made clear following correct path. Therefore man's laws must match god's laws, vote promise transition.

Add somehow, remember though might started Moral Majority, many fundies truly believe war Christianity. push back making man's laws god's laws, say people following path, correct path according god, also good going get heaven, well that's clearly spiritual battle fought souls people. since people overwhelmingly flocking path helping coerce force wayward onto path heaven, waging battle god himself.

So save everyone right path, war extermination going them. end religion politics fused, end goal political voting eternal salvation.

And yeah, there's whole lot religious things conveniently get forgotten conflicts fundies' rules salvation. little thing know, super bothered Christmastime people say written Xmas people trying cross Christ. possibly twist attack yourself??   even read paper? sources end, references usually listed.

I would willing guess 37k actually going turn underestimate since CDC basing previous years. However, probably change number much. non American, didn’t realise Parks Rec documentary I've heard people dying [things like cancer surgery postponed issue. elective procedures important others postponing put people risk (personally, honestly get they're postponing life saving ones, like cancer heart blockage procedures). definitely lots excess deaths directly caused Covid. “Science liar sometimes.” - Trump administration sorry dumb question, mean never developed antibodies first couple times? possibly develop went away months? im genuinely curious possible. sure would love see lot criminal prosecutions so-called leaders depraved indifference human life. crap pulled politics gotten incalculable number people sick dead. traitors nation, every one. answer this, fucking insane!!!!!!!?????!!?!!??!?!?!?!?! know of. gotta way higher Huston problems: name iconic duo. Okay reach much? Maybe changed mind masks? Children Men come. Fuck options. pharmacy administration funded local govt, think.

Sometimes get offered flu shot I've told name, always ""It'll free""

But I've got insurance, might bait switch ever caught me. Darwinism already kids passed genes. cannot comprehend risking life attend *drum circle*.  People practiced religion home. Also virtual congregation form live stream so. least congregate outdoors. Thought said “Lil Cheney” like also secretly rapper. Damn can't imagine living like basically privacy doubt will. Perhaps given $1200 live past 4months wouldn’t feel like go work remember looking twitter two week ago. refused write ""coronavirus."" tweet tweet ""CHINA VIRUS.""  Yea listen everyone else. Please don’t come here. good, yours. (When things right want visit Germany. It’s birthplace.) promise come visit aren’t risk killing entire country result panic buying empty shelves, one enough eat. know food supply chain works right? There’s 7 8 times usual stock lying around? understand right?   know zero resources? people opinions like yours, fight change, given away free. like charge, like treating like shit getting away it. fuck said magically work out? hard people like roll die ""boo boo hard can't it"" win lose. Mass walk outs work working long time. even word. called strike problem people like stupid opinions cannot stick together fight better tomorrow. Invisible China Virus!? Really!? Seriously, guy... I'm worried family first - easily afford grand make sure they're safe. people love taken care of, I'll start worrying population large. case numbers peaked March, since fallen recently, almost 0. restrictions lifted, almost nobody wore mask anymore. number cases rising again, that's mask requirement reintroduced - people wear 1000 cases whole country. also find masks uncomfortable never wear one except compulsory. far, single case infection attributed supermarket, happens within family church congregations nursing homes. surprising, since pass people short time supermarket, around sick person seconds most.

To stop virus would massive restrictions worldwide 0 cases occur several weeks. one single case overlooked restrictions lifted, virus massively present months later. live virus vaccination widely available.

Fuck, yo..... shaking head stupidity infected person’s decision first, comment reminded reality MILLIONS people. headline doesn’t immediately instill possible poverty angle people’s minds. 

The U.S. government failed provide adequate financial support protection citizens. bet voted Trump it’s like open religion. also bet didn’t vote Obama even though spoke religion.

I think it’s excuse. Here’s crazy thought. Don’t 11 children living paycheck paycheck. Odds likely killed several people already.  I’ve riding bike, camping, generally enjoying beautiful summer! lockdown order doesn’t force hunker down, it’s cull spread reduce facilities usage nonessential businesses. 

Now maybe you’re outdoors person, maybe you’re looking go clubbing such...well things get tricky ya Assuming sort hedge get first, makes sense. Still thinking 100 million one vaccine must mean expected need 2 shots. Silly. *They* live it. I'm shocked people look assume &amp; tell take mask ""It's okay! it."" Anyone this. know I've been, I've contact with, vice versa. someone tells take mask I'm keeping &amp; staying far away them. 

My brother told ""Don't trust anyone"" first time I'm following advice. assume everyone it. Follow universal precautions. largest study Spain hospitalized covid patients resulted half (50%) neurological damage/problems, include headaches, dizziness, seizures, insomnia lightest symptoms, 5% considered severe. actually suggesting pay cuts enough money open conditions plays slow spread virus. Schools: Around 20 - 30 people cramped indoor area relatively long period time. Statistically average rate infected low symptoms, high chance active spread infection school detected late. Especially younger children unrealistic social distancing, mask wearing etc. rules followed.

Overall would guess risk pretty high. something else think about. important activity. quite easy forgo leisure activities schools far important society. Maybe missed comment. announced week two happens everyone stock up. proof transmission ever proved. Accept things can't change.

Change things can't accept.

Maybe time focus. Find change want work that. Put everything else aside moment. Taking action really helps limiting problem space. Shocking, they've reasonable people far... happens underfund education decades. hear details? see details household number people living there. people cannot afford pay ""few grand"" ? need start thinking global scale , something everyone world access to. Speaking impartial foreigner, Mrrrka still ~~some~~ best prestigious universities world. long everything transparent, studies properly documented peer reviewed, would confidence. It'll gone April.  Yeah, actually, say ... guy FB told two family members died heart attack one pneumonia said listed COVID-19 FAKE. like... wtf (???) guess people go lengths believe something don’t want to. I'd argue even larger group people rely lungs breath.  


Also, nothing diminsh mental health faster potentially deadly virus gettig system. course have, explain everyone supposed eat total shutdown month hell going US A? Order closure consulate official announcement? actually functioning government left US Mad Max there? Seems idyllic. totally see living kind arrangement good everyone involved (sans super contagious pandemic going anyways.) Means always people around babysit kids adults work, always support network someone gets sick laid off, etc. individual houses shared property families people also still privacy need it. Atascadero apparently. Gatherings unnecessary travel still restricted. Try again. would've thought anti-choice makes sense.  Nah dawg, put test faith. #checkmate  Considering another human corona virus, HCoV-NL63 (\*) suspected cause Kawasaki also uses ACE2-Receptor, development surprising.

(\*) people causes something similiar common cold. I've thought through. far best way stop virus tracks. infection rate continues is, grocery stores going shut anyway - may well planned. look extremely old 61. 
L.E. I’m retarded can’t read title. stupid selfish. roommate household, article says nothing children hers. Even were... chose children. chosen job paid sick leave. 

Going work aside, tell people shares home spreading potentially deadly and/or life changing disease them. that's stupid selfish ... definitely psychotic. point needs highlighted more.

In case Irish app; geolocation used all. uses bluetooth collect ids devices come within range (a meters) stores locally. test positive covid HSE request upload ids; even control choose to.

The id device changes regularly prevent tracing. also enter personal information app either. tell you, anonymous user, within meters another anonymous user tested positive. Better risk commit murder. fuck 16 people household? Her: opposite true. Virus Sauce Michelle here. Average 15? Something similiar happened Austria. person stands trial court. That's problem Americans, least Leftist Americans - look problem go 'can't' there's legal cheap way go it.

You *can* leave. *can* penetrate border Canada Mexico, disappear.

It's thing 'I can't vote work', like imagine enslaved can't take time participate democracy.

That's difference Left Right - left whinges rules stopping something; right goes anyway. That's keep winning. Civil War happened, got butts *did something* government tyranny.  Yeah big surprise huh? scumbags killing people along afford insanely priced drugs. made people think suddenly would grow conscience right thing now? Big Pharma wall street look pandemic great money making opportunity gouge living shit American public like always doing! experts figuring bit higher that.  takes real commitment. Peeing front people easy. Sounds like something 'Karen' would share Facebook... Lowering viral loads. No, psychosis caused malfunctioning neurotransmitters. 'psychological'. Someone living many people probably couple options: Work starve. Similar parts country politicizing now? empathy richly deserved fellow American may share different politics ? Perhaps practicing change want start.  sentenced 5 years prison. Absolutely. Flu endemic infects roughly amount every year odd exception. epidemic pandemic scale meaning it’s highly infectious nothing stop it. exponential growth starting kick numbers become devastatingly high quickly on. Where's protests? Bit odd omission days Test capacity static. NFL investing means tests, taking away tests someone else. told 15 years ago Cheney family would branded liberal conservatives would laughed face. world gets weirder weirder  course usa mean literally politics lol name. 

You dont get level solely merit character, some...well, politics lol. Probably cause gays diseases worry about. S.T.D. ones oh honey, tell you’re extremely compassionate fellow people. ❤️
when people get hungry enough find food, doesn’t matter travel miles get it.

+you also forgot farmers would loss don’t people sale food to
+when reopens farms hit hard they’re won’t fresh food
+I imagine truckers pissed getting money weeks hired again, maybe truckers don’t deliver 
+Even hungry people humans like hoard hard times *Takes mask sec**taks pic moments*
ThE DeViL WoNt LiSteN fail see would stop cyber attack? like US hack US companies.

Alternatively could say US spitting dummy China refuses allow US Wuhan consulate staff back without undergoing quarantine PCR test, US barge revenge.

Or hell, maybe White House fishing shooting war China, Trump could actual wartime president thus rally around flag effect. Fortunately Xi dumb fall obvious move that's frustrating Trump enough he's going sorts crazy moves trying spark something.

The point without official announcement allowing anyone spin narrative want. trash. people trash. Human excrement. Oh i’m telling that, it’s world leaders industry tycoons sides pond telling world literally decades... words lots money. one grocery store town. hope people follow rules here. Eh, would depressing cities suburbs started look like Hong Kong. ""Oh Gweg"" - Barbara Walters Greg Louganis dived pool banging head. Hard get around ears? Government officials function filling pockets money. easier government govern small country super diffuse population density? r/NoahGetTheBoat Thats crazy, got test Monday. results 11 Tuesday.

The nasal swab fucking sucks though quick turn results. 'Contact sports - ex soccer'


Wut?   illegal? feels like illegal  words: Survival richest.

Been way forever lies going exposed millions Americans usual. symptoms Summer lol. test reliable. look symptoms act accordingly asked wife, know would eat first marshmallow, ask could go stuff do. wife would wait marshmallows gloat got two got one. 

Then would pull bag marshmallows bought way home. Likely said, damn near impossible get food online reliant food stamps. Apparently Amazon fresh cities option use that's available everyone. I'm reliant food stamps. can't get aide. lost job back beginning March started get unemployment due paid internship (don't get started that). I'm facing homelessness due it, lucky friend funds help lost job, one thing. wish would make possible use food stamps instances. wish lot things right now. story unique one thing makes whole situation fucked many. thing Florida. Got call health dept kid exposed. Earliest testing appt 4 days initial phone call. Then, 10 days results. It’s mess. people criminally prosecuted I'll never understand well *get* one It’s bad. I’m thankful live master planned community north Phoenix city limits. wear mask social distance. get tested due friend temporarily living us works Intel. It’s huge obviously many cases. whole team came Covid. tested family too. us came back negative. back day (tested Mayo hospital) tested free site car took three days. gets tested every two weeks now. Still negative thankfully. seems like you’re agreeing me. one good parents one likely access enlightening useful information like taught think future consequences actions. Less ignorant. everyone equal access caring parents, sex ed, even planned parenthood. Every one us made mistakes growing mix factors like lack information young person ignorance. baby stuck fork light socket. fuck up. 

And I’m also trying say that’s factor make excuses. There’s plenty examples people every opportunity, biologically environmentally horrible things whatever reason, people difficult neglected backgrounds overcome amazing things. 

But, numbers game, lot people well provided necessary tools manage figure without mom saying people coming work sick management batting eye unless workers come positive test. Sick people without tests still showing up. 101 unrelated fever ONE night work told stay home 72 hours fever went next morning. lack consistency rules enforcement country exactly bad shape. burglar's eyes, everybody looks like burglar. happened state supermajority state legislature. That's way decades. indeed. much general problems..with maybe less time, though magnitude could worse heavily populated zone cone I've moved around work UK quite bit, always factor cost living locally salary. 

It's London never makes sense. 

Assuming mortgage around 4.5X annual income, earn around £70k per year; allows borrow £315K, 10% deposit that's house around £350k region. 

London pays around 10-20% London jobs. I'd maybe looking say £80k income London. Meaning around £400k buy house. 

The difference is, London 400k gets tiny terraced/semi detached house looks like shit shit area. Poor air quality. Poor scenery. 

350k Midlands gets 4 bed detached house large driveway, garage garden space nice semi-rural area good transport links, fresh air nice surrounding scenery. equivalent London would millions, even driveway garage probably reach. 

Seems crazy people would want live expensive cities. really can't understand it. Moderna, Merck: Fuck America, give shit, pay die! Gawd bless 'Murca! Wait, people instructed self-quarantine, get paid time? I'm sorry, that's true, country shithole. They're saying put fuel fire. lot sitting president's talked give seat first term. say plausible deniability later want spin election manipulated. end trump get re-elected move out, without much fuss. think ""if vote one, vote other, 3rd party question. like either."" situation now. Four months ago? So, developed vaccine virus spread? Or, they’re full shit. Oh sorry, Vox puts lot. Yes, settlements Area C, Israel paused decade ago allow negotiations.

That's told you. Instead addressing that, post simple overview basic stuff. guess Oslo Accords say think say. Holy shit Tourette’s Guy reference. Thanks that. means catching virus, yes? socialist states faring well either. mean yeah, course blame China. totally fair blame Trump's incompetence too. Chinese leadership censored quelled doctors warning world it. could gone away like SARS 17 years ago. mention disgustingly unhygienic conditions animals wet markets kept/slaughtered.

Blame China virus, blame Trump response virus locally. Every president pretend religious get votes. way haven’t atheist president. Drives crazy religion interwoven politics, especially religion demonstrate true. It’s beyond absurd. Grow people, time give Santa Claus. It’s 2020 fuck sake. little late, trump. trust China saying? I’ve seen reports saying two Chinese foreign nationals trying get information vaccine. Honestly, considering bullshit China pulling last weeks, long time coming. watch Donald Chump's news conference now. horrible. ratherr watch Fauci. Old age? happened continues happen blue supermajority state that's way decades.  Yea Ive got 2 bedrooms/2 baths central location San Diego. Really bay expensive. german here, also heared bad things ours. andwhile perfect im pretty damn happy it. 

few years ago 8day hospital stay surgery herniated disc, also therapy after, kinds meds. whole thing went half year. paid like 100€ overall part hospital wlan parking. oh picked specific specialist perform surgery visited 4 different docs get different oinions options option left got wait 5 days.

also first 6 weeks full sickpay job, insurance paid ~75% regular salary month till could work close 6 months.

Thank much girlfriend. Actually both. He’s dead (And, course, actually cataclysmically dire) enforce E-Verify nationwide  think coincidence US #1 Brazil #2: leaders politicized pandemic. last week guy pulled gun asked wear mask grocery store shop most. normal selfishness, political statement. Aside LA, mostly Republican counties. big Pikachu surprised face. Damn actually avoided questions like politician. I'm surprised launch 15 minute rant nothing ends blaming Biden personally photoshopping pictures. dumb. It’s difficult wear mask hair/nail salon. Grocery shopping definitely medium risk come frequent close contact people may touching things others touched. reads right. Found narcissist! Life post-truth era wild. Oh damn. issues Batman punching black Chinese guys?

I quit reading Batman Nolan took movies.

Kinda... anglocentric tastes. Lotta Frenchmen also died Dunkirk. Probably Nolan's fault, trusted Nolan take care puppy WB trusted Batman.

And Miller went right fucking window. Dude went fucking psycho. nontrivial number stupid, angry white people live sparsely populated states. There's much smaller number smart, evil mostly white people running GOP.

The Electoral College problem. Hillary popular vote. yes, understimate potential leverage above. caved loud gun-toting mob Agent Orange supporters. shame. I’m pretending answers suggesting imaginative less defeatist mindset. example, regarding money, would assume would money saved able reallocated empty classrooms lower indoor utility bills. don’t see Florida red section. Welcome Japan. Haha That's literally one reason someone may wear mask Japan, weird there. parents insane. I'm sorry Bless heart.  Good point. actually spent time old farmhouse (Germany) roof petrified tree trunks support. 
Fairly large home 1, heater main living room. kept warm winter cool summer. draft. Great construction.
Far better cookie cutters much US. that. thing suck up. way better burying family member. winter going hard we're going indoors, windows up, living enclosed spaces, sharing circulation. gotta survive this. end. right now, everyone needs suck survive. go visit grandparents. wise them. Easter come late next year, like November?  would except others get sick collateral damage. salient point, one honestly forgot account for. data I've come across says actual 5-10x higher population prevalence average vs tested numbers. definitely lower death rate &lt;1%. would maintain hospitals fill (which really seen scale yet), death rate increase that, without treatment outcomes categorically worse. 

Can point seen 70x? I'm assuming that's absolute failure testing infrastructure. happens let lifetime legendary scumbag reality TV star run country. Motherfuckers better show vote, make sure mutant/toddler hybrid sad 4-year chapter history books grocery store considered low risk? Everyone city heading one point low risk? According CDC masks 14 randomized controlled trials measures support substantial effect transmission laboratory-confirmed influenza. similarly found limited evidence effectiveness improved hygiene environmental cleaning. identified several major knowledge gaps requiring research, fundamentally improved characterization modes person-to-person effect hand hygiene combined face masks laboratory-confirmed influenza statistically pooled analysis, found significant reduction influenza transmission use face overall reduction ILI laboratory-confirmed influenza cases face mask group significant either household studies reported significant reduction secondary laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections face mask systematic review found significant effect face masks transmission laboratory-confirmed find evidence surgical-type face masks effective reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission, either worn infected persons RCTs hand hygiene face masks support substantial effect transmission laboratory-confirmed influenza, limited evidence available environmental measures behind barrier cash register there's constant flow people moving pretty large building chances getting pretty good. worst case scenarios staying room person people low ventilation long amount time lots talking. trump made calculated guess virus bad. want ruin economy. guessed wrong America people suffer Go ahead, please do. point way people willing engage change medical industry country subjected absolute dumpster fire insurance, pharma, medical policy United States vomited you’re last 4 decades see it’s face absolute catastrophe nonsense real time. emperor stopped wearing clothes long ass time ago. genuinely believe he’s sending DHS Gestapo rile people create big protests. needs something blame failure contain spread. (The original protests caused small uptick, Chicago New York proved didn’t cause wildfire spread like FL &amp; TX). also gets boogeyman rile base against. Well know would say badass, insist. pisses off, that's even voter suppression.

Why can't register polling station? like even want vote! /s way he’s gonna win elections. he’s handled covid many died aunt passed, cremation. uncle army yet scraped option could afford. pointed “factual evidence” obviously wrong making predictions based would lead best estimation. fact anything lower factual evidence would inevitably correct.

The difference .25 .6 huge, it’s still frustrating variability still high.
Personally feel it’s actually .2 .3% people argue theyre blue don’t come aggressive.

I don’t really point expand someone’s knowledge actually happening right now, expect moving forward. People react dramatically emotionally official case
numbers even though component equation. seems clear United States identifying cases much efficiently past case per day death per day trend lines don’t follow path. 

Anyway, think you’ve thought things little deeper might normally reddit conversation nothing else take away this.  slow occur 60 percent infected mean 12 percent hospital think CNA handle 60 million patients balloon knot. seen drink water one hand? Switzerland. Give call, drop by, get results next day. household taking risks, us tested twice far, reason go third time either. hard fight against. cousin heroin/meth combo user years. sad truth plenty mental health experts rehab facilities would happy help her, going get help wants herself.

Florida probably terrible also fact deaths outlier compared people develop lasting health issues. I’m sorry hear 😢 Hope you’re family stay safe sending hug way 🤗 state CA population. 2x amount people Florida. Imagine Florida pulling 20k cases day. That’s basically adjusted CA population. Compared Arizona, would equivalent 20-25k cases day. agree.. course come main question.. would money come from? mention, Wisconsin gets -25 January. (I actually never heard outdoor restaurant. Sounds interesting). Heater wouldn’t cut space big enough social distance. Sadly, there’s right answer. definitely could work southern states, would cost much winter states impractical. again, I’m hands-on learning. go back, kids outside much nature art haha. problem Trump anything even remotely related fucking job description, people fall feet like kind deity. Like congrats something right I'm going start sucking dick job. tears semen

These 2 go together far often anyone admit. That's crazy Texas may starting improve due requirement wear masks public. wants take credit that. know can't officially strike, hope least informal talk teachers TX walk-out sick-out. support understanding nation, I'm sure. 

Either way, good luck, try stay safe!  wasn’t trying toot horn anything — think I’m trying say agree you. can’t become anything want go rags riches anymore. many people think working long hours life get there, that’s realistic society — that’s often enough get by. 

Trying say American dream something eventually put grandkids better life doesn’t sell “ra ra” speeches kids America great, lie perpetuated. said March 5, we’d less 100k cases. I'm feeling pain, mate. 

Nurse here, company work regular testing staff: swab tests voluntary instant blood tests (not accurate PCR, course). 

People instant test anytime, repeat want.

I'm trying healthcare flex, friends. giving alternative experience comparison. 

I also live near large hospital, free walk testing. 

For context, over-run cases state. Hi Australia, we're thinking same! work sick get replaced, theres plenty job market looking right Oh see, meant virus spread faster tests administered, number tests relative number cases decrease. Makes perfect sense now. caring themselves...? wearing mask risky life.. no, I’m asking actual solutions

The solutions offer born. really missing political will. per capita map makes going evident. (time sensitive data red districts CA? largely central valley conservative strongholds. LA poorly, LA densely packed special needs city nobodies literally put billboards themselves.

Florida? Florida *fucked* right now. [left leaning] governors make masks illegal states end week.

That ""no true Scotsman"" seem running themes yet countries around managed fair far better...

You deny facts want. change truth: Sweden fucked up. Shame unable admit Perfect comment, spot Fucking terrorist stage I'd prefer Turkmenistan vaccine anything developed US. I'm dead! course. destroyed country they'll run off.

If nations smart allow entry. That’s pretty sad Ohio, ~~14~~ 6 excess deaths among people ~~45~~ 50 every COVID death. paper's authors updated methodology since read paper, change numbers one consequences. COVID-19 members only.

/s NYC pop. density 27K, SF 17K Still, NYC 1/370 people die, SF something like 1/17,000 people die. (in SF) shut early hard, great. Now, though, cases climbing worryingly, still nothing like NY. Would love see Ages deaths survived many hurricane (and pandemic lockdown) b/c “hoard” supplies. always 2-3 weeks supplies family eats don’t burden charities government programs come feed/supply either unfortunate means prepare themselves, naive, stupid. also wear mask, distance, use sanitizer like crazy. much reasons. protect family first foremost secondly protect vulnerable idiotic. either reasoning makes narcissist article wrong. mask wearing makes narcissist, hoarding does, article wrong. 

Does occur anyone else media trying attach negative terms like “low IQ” “narcissist” non mask wearing order pressure nonconformists comply? mean...whatever works guess, seems fallout people wearing masks feel like somehow smart caring. maybe scared, naturally compliant, health issues. whatever. love mask wearing, hate oversimplification human behavior. promise closed vs. vented system - AC AC, ensures increase severity prevalence. really. would say closer bars night clubs list. Kids sit still, run around high respiratory rate. also yell/project voice. ""Nobody""? I'm thinking nobody. still goddamn album brown people /s Agree fronts. know people take seriously pets also carry virus? Japanese contained 99.9% mask wearing instead lockdown.  States too.  death long term disability rates massively higher since started masking later, people get fined wearing mask public, contain without shutting businesses. help things governor Florida goes tv says motorcyle car accident deaths included official count. Zurich get 87F average.

That’s pretty clear indication September/October realistic. mad focusing important metric matter bullshit people throw ignore higher death totals?

lol okay. keep chugging conspiracy theory juice.  read link, actually giving vaccines kids, process kind March health workers administered vaccine poor neighbourhood edge Abbottabad called Nawa Sher. hepatitis B vaccine usually given three doses, second month first. April, instead administering second dose Nawa Sher, doctor returned Abbottabad moved nurses Bilal Town, suburb Bin Laden lived. sure that? Many COVID deaths ""caused"" secondary causes. Even directly-caused deaths may pneumonia, blood clotting, 5 states COVID-19 deaths experienced large proportional increases deaths nonrespiratory underlying causes, including diabetes (96%), heart diseases (89%), Alzheimer disease (64%), cerebrovascular diseases (35%) (Figure). New York City experienced largest increases nonrespiratory deaths, notably heart disease (398%) diabetes (356%).

In five states affected COVID, deaths diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's nearly doubled pandemic period.

Getting guess number yearly flu deaths obviously hard. likely flu vaccines vulnerable (aka nursing homes), dropped lot ~10 years ago. want minimize impact flu society though - one good thing almost certain come pandemic we're going kill flu years decades come. Uhhh... seen ""kids"" marching streets lately? “I testicles that.” rules, aren’t telling you’re getting tested should. people common sense. live consider extremely fortunate, **Government** paying 100% ~~copays and~~ costs associated healthcare anything COVID-19 related.

Yay universal healthcare! quarantine someone send air bnb couple weeks?  Hold folks. conspiracy theorist house. Except he's wrong. 

He gave stats entire state Texas specifically referred patrons people going bars. 

Not every single texan tested went bar, stayed home gone work. 

If OP provide stats show 9/10 negative people visit bar would correct. Ok, seems pretty clear cut he's recommending wearing mask.

You're making look even worse posting original video. looks like buffoon knowing know now.

Big mistake made. I'm biologist I'm related biologists scientist.

Best case scenario get vaccines, enough people willing get vaccinated get herd immunity, mutate outside parameters, disappears. That's unlikely. 

More likely scenario get vaccines two things happen. 1) enough people, particularly US, willing get vaccine herd immunity happen anyway 2) vaccines targeted enough virus easily mutate avoid vaccines we're sorta back basically vaccines all. 

The issue remember there's chance illness protect getting again. seems likely conclusively determined yet.  Lovely. way suggest.  Hope sue everything has. leadership failure people unable mentally deal unprecedented modern pandemic end sight?

People dumb shit they're scared, government answers right now. government action could prevented this? someone died. government cant prevent deaths unless lock everyone homes. solution?

People need understand government keep 100% safe right now. Nevermind. Lockdowns? Where? 


Every Jethro Granny complaining fighting get things reopened since end March. actually lockdowns, things looking bad predicted. dipshit local government started listening Granny Jethro, started reopening beaches, bars, gyms, barbers, etc... requiring masks, etc... scientific medical advice. Covid-19 getting bad predicted. many local governments realizing fucked starting shut well mandating masks. wonder many people fired jobs catching covid second time, accused lying first false positive.

My point though, false negatives. think place 10% rate bad really fucked, means likely right containment measures infect animals eliminated every human could still hiding animal populations. That’s course hypothetical. reality can’t eliminate every human. could accomplish feat still weren’t enough could probably eradicate given bit time clearly we’d resolute cooperative people. 

These viruses diseases moved cultures resulting behaviors biology. push populations wild areas we’re likely encounter novel viruses. densely populate areas. travel extensively quickly. tolerate maintain social economic inequalities. makes widespread mitigation difficult. 

It’d easier stop pandemics ever happening lack even that. Pandemics aren’t like hurricanes happen move along path people may occupy, viruses inert must move toward pandemic. Translation:

Till 24:00 21/07/2020, Liaoning 164 cases COVID-19 (33 imported abroad), 157 recorded 2 died. Currently 5 patients still hospitalised. currently also 4 asymptomatic carriers undergoing medical observation treatment dedicated hospitals. isnt unique America realized popular assume so. Flu deaths rare. years it’s super high. I’ve 500 many times I’d argue good percentage people go party - sport. lot scientists experts expressed concerns reliability antibody testing. [The CDC said Instead attacking people internet, try discussion them. Name publicized.  people this? anyone even believe stuff? (Germany) going fast. overwhelmed test capacities - called doc day yesterday ""do want come today tomorrow? come 11 clock get result next day 8 clock"". Tested yesterday, Today got result (negative). Time test result 21hrs. Worked like charme.

USA need help. man power asks nicely think many countrys would help. military saying - expensive weapon soldier - costs 18 years get new one. goes workers, citizens, human beings. You... We... people important thing. would happy goes better you. would like help know how.

Stay safe, you. wish best. Everyone you. hope, hopes proven useless past, think year Democrats *finally* break Republicans' stranglehold California able rescue people Republicans trapped poverty there. They’re pro-birth, pro-life Like is? near bad people pretend. going up? No, deaths going down. Fine, explain lack covid surge NY, MA, PA, ME. 5G, conspiracy fan vote think Putin wants that, hope right. also hope goes prison instead going home. we're supposed make statements need operate abundance caution. Testing unreliable still unavailable many instances. Treatment ad hoc good day, left hall tent outside bad day. Vaccines works long way away. treat is: completely uncertain. Wear mask, avoid going much possible, distance. quarantine comes back... home me. I’m risk severe symptoms. Don’t sure trump administration want general inoculation program election.

His whole MO try disenfranchise enough voters, scare people showing polls take USPS apart.

I’m hoping greater minds prevail. AMERICAN BAD said people, SLOW testing dooooowwwn. bosses do. ones force come office pandemic job could home, though... dunno, man. sounds pretty fucking stupid me. State governments liquid funds levels endure whatever COVID gives vaccine? No. State's chip least third whatever unemployment now. shut down, unemployment skyrockets, State's stay afloat long declare bankruptcy. 

Why else think places like Florida, Georgia, Texas eager open early? wanted sales tax revenue (however little may be). Could care less small businesses fire everyone owners working monster debt. matter long sales tax revenue there. right report weekends, that's it. That's usually mondays.

I think put finger it, still. daily new cases chart Worldometer reporting +227 yesterday, yesterday's new cases figure main page +20. 
78166 +227-20 (already included) + 132 = 78505

I guess they're reporting weird schedule causes worldometer constantly go back adjust.

It bit confusing, though. one looked headline figure, they'd get impression Sweden control than, say, Belgium, days neighbors even. they're.. not. Maybe brain fog nobody noticed yet one supporters leave hell alone fuck fuck every one support . take time train staff, order masks stores available someone one willing wear one, etc. 

But yes, done many weeks ago. Yeah, I’m judging? Like said, there, done that. Don’t want - don’t think many do.

I’d argue one things “essential” however. Attempted murder. God tempting sometimes, use plastic more, hard without noticed. You’d lose. Vaccines usually free. cheap much better thing spend economic costs people getting disease. think there's still polio Africa, too. Bill Gates might vaccination program trying eradicate it. last couple years, think bad vaccines actually caused polio, too. fail patrons infected, hospital, dead?

OP talking businesses bars. 

You gave stats entire state texas. assuming every single texan tested gone bar that's false. 

We talking bars here. 

Where's stat says 9/10 come back negative go bars?

You talking general pop. talking bars... hence patrons. People need seize day quite literally, use social isolation starting point get poor eating habits bad lifestyle choices control. I’m confident looked shelf. obvious item hadn’t restocked based number available appearance shelf surrounding items. description verb “wandered” “fancy word” genuinely makes one wonder talking linguistic poverty seriously income disparity. 

With respect statistical analysis, subset select group cases—infected individuals sharing characteristic— taken population selective analysis. post title refers group within population (population referring statistics definition, IE complete “global” data set), appropriate label subgroup subset. 

I believe something requiring explanation, please, continue abandon defeated point settle admiring basic competence written word. really apples apples though. hardly testing available New York worst cases doubt massively under-counted. see difference mortality rate NY's sky high testing patients deathly ill. 

The number cases California obviously problem, really fair comparison. think travel recommendations implemented earlier. Still, hardest hit regions far Stockholm surroundings.

When comes nursing homes. official closing make much difference Sweden cause already closed visitors several weeks earlier.

(Dear karmic system, please take moment consider Bolsonaro's karma and, shall say, act appropriately?) vaccines too. Oh yes schools grand. actually decent salaries teachers students tend pay attention see happening covid coming years tbh Something like 10 days symptoms. 10th day start getting worse quickly. Im going soon finds government seems competent response facet pandemic basic math go ""$20 per dose times 400,000,000 doses.... JARED!!!! Find way get action!!!"" fall shit. people children children... People allowed go maskless long way stubborn selfish start now. Allowing people get away months enabled keep it. Absolute nonsense. idea thousands people packing tight areas screaming magically spreading virus asanine comparable narratives coming white house. media outlets reported amazing politically correct virus within days- words, would even possible see increase hospitalization even testing absent mass random sampling. right shows they're engaging propaganda- ignorant disease's progression.

And since contact tracers instructed ask protests, expect?

And surprise, surprise- places like Atlanta, LA, Chicago, urban centers protests seeing big rise cases exactly would expect it- weeks inciting event. That's lockdown! That's what's brought rates down.  case many people test positive. remember reading study done months ago majority people tested positive area san francisco working class people essential jobs fair, Spanish Flu got name Spain one countries hiding numbers, one originated from.  run trucks, Russia provide Lend-Lease?

It’s months since I’ve even hugged another person. It’s driving crazy miss human touch :( I'm 8.5 months pregnant. found back December, remember watching Wuhan wondering government could mess badly. Next month get bring little one dumpster fire. 

Pregnancy enough fears own. worry catching covid, baby catching it. Death scares me, sure, chances low. However, potential life altering affects really concern me. 

Now 10+ months could different place. done best wait prepared baby - happened. never know. choice now, would probably wait vaccine released. also strict timeline. Good luck! we'll fine think odds happen die within weeks catch covid19?

On separate note, take yearly averages deaths causes past years, add 140,000 extra covid deaths...our current deaths 2020 still 20,000+ deaths previous years, meaning almost chance counting covid deaths, likelihood covid deaths significantly higher official numbers.

It virus already killed people USA western Europe pandemic last 100 years, killed worldwide least 600,000 people months (with data excess deaths suggesting real toll already closer 800,000) still killing least 5,000 per day, *despite largest containment efforts conceived human history*. overwhelmed healtcare systems plenty countries, including first-world ones.

Truly, true victim COVID. honor sacrifice. seeing anyone wants lock forever. think arguing ""lock forever"" would recommend browse read people actually advocating for.

I tell though: countries states locked bit others better economically reopened quickly.

It never choice economy lives. things helped saved lives also going help economy. Even said goal 100% preserve economy costs, recommendation would stay locked cautious reopening. Here's clue: incompetent government response ongoing health crisis keeps people away restaurants tourists away visiting. Using hard work discipline manage situation mitigate risks gets people spending money again.

As known studying previous large scale pandemics opening economy soon worse choice economy choice lot governors seemed go with. r/leopardsatemyface Short answer - yes. true infection first time, mild second time. 

And post stories X person mild disease March/April hospitalized now, people likely false positives first time never rid disease first place (meaning false negatives meanwhile). Maybe answer go college get better job. Absolutely. Sweden know better population overall stupid population overall US. least used think that. Man, work keeping Americans ruin relative excellent performance this, y'all gonna ruin yourselves. literally reason go office

But boss micromanage aren’t there?  break you:

Don't forget, started seafood market Wuhan too. else expect win conflict nation field 4-5 times manpower 10x industrial capacity? Total War must fought reservations. state secedes woods, make sound? fully agree you. comment totally tongue cheek illogical people comes children safe. non-lockdown countries like Sweden (which never suspended classes), COVID 19 killed grand total 0 kids. Makes sense everyone paying double paid countries.  flaw expecting intellectual honesty people insist virus real. chloroquine worked. Thoughts prayers send, mass death receive. A) may lasting immunity

B) herd immunity could high something contagious. spread doesnt magically stop hit threshold, overshoot. overshoot significant virus spreading rapidly.

C) relying herd immunity would invariably overrun hospital capacity death rates would go -- covid noncovid medical issues. Unless also wearing mask* It’s time!!  lmao. seems, by-and-large, Americans care virus living life like doesn’t exist.

to contrary - seems, ""by-and-large"", seen single credible survey regarding Americans' attitudes survey elected officials' mismanagement that's pretty good incentive get one. Think I'll go vape store next payday sure. heart attack feels several times day (my heart weird shit every days maybe), crippling migraine-like headaches average every day, hours time, past 2 years!

Always expect aneurysm one days lie fantasizing trepanning :))) Remember prepare medical directives, also, case still alive incapable making decisions regarding treatment.

Everyone this, pandemic no. CDC.gov numbers explanations. lock enabled UK protect hospitals overload, work treat virus better (including steroids reducing death rates third) put track trace system place. sort things enabled partial reopening needed time. Gonna second reply comment said: face shields effective unless also wearing mask

That said agree sentiment post Ok, democrats still wants $600 weekly.

The question percentage needs get immunity herd immunity achieved. 30% way low herd immunity. Well ideally elect people listen experts fields represent make decisions public’s best interests.

**Of course know that.** Every single person involvement fields psychology sociology knows that. Every single person. 

So, congratulations. discovered something every living research psychologist considered every study they've ever done: people give different results depending format study.

I honestly think narcissistic behavior sociopathic behavior spectrum.

Neither really create empathy emotional connection human beings. teacher much wants return school, understand saying. (Caveat: mean WISH could return school safely,not think answers complex mess in). 

 Teaching, learning, built relationship student/teacher: trust, camaraderie, kindness, academic curiosity, etc. hard replicate keep tabs distance. course varies based individual student grade level!

But examples person teaching best: Example 1: lesson person, 'read room' see interest/attention span waning--I adjust activity, energy level, insert anecdote, break movement, etc. 

Example 2: taking time explain something child grasping concept--we use formative assessment immediate feedback person often far difficult distance. Kids people--and people formative years that. jump volunteer enthusiastically asked need help. Often--and can't state strongly enough--OFTEN--when asked need help, students decline assistance insist understand concepts ""fine"". formative/summative assessments tell different story. person, literally use teacher tricks charms get student accept help therefore improve/learn. distance, again, difficult. Kids shut screen. Insist mom dad well. person, face facts strive learn, even difficult.

Example 3: often use 'gradual release' model (I do/we do/you do) learning new concepts. best used person teacher ensure maximum engagement ""I do"" segment, collaboration "" do"", immediately check understanding ""you do"" part lesson.

I could go on...... know already like ""blah blah blah"" lot people. screens computers could teach people, would using years would teachers (see Ray Bradbury idea might look like!). can't. trying best distance, one know REPLACEMENT teaching live miss like hell. want feel kids going it.

If man shooting bunch babies school create change makes think would? .. mandate people wear mask...Don’t “leave states” want “some freedom” say you’re going make schools open, doesn’t make much sense... lab tests via serology it’s prob based antibodies/antigens well PCR via Panther, also used state labs. enough people trained run 24/7. hand hygiene, face masks might able reduce transmission infections therefore value influenza pandemic healthcare resources stretched.

Seems specifically note effective infections, influenza. COVID-19 flu strain. read things cite them. another chemical company make reagents? sad. Filipinos play integral role healthcare system. nurses. CNAs lot roles.

It always problem clumping Asians one group. lot southeast Asians don’t fit stereotype people view Asians don’t struggles vocalized compared Latinos Black people. 

This another reminder can’t unchecked pandemic. We’re losing lot skilled labor human beings dying young. get one bomb masks politicians seem wearing? I've sticking delivery curbside pickup groceries and, risk low, wiping everything comes house outside. I'm lucky option. Apparently saw pandemic something vehicle loot taxpayers spread idiotic conspiracy theories. This. Sad reality, way get by. ""no shit"" award? I've year, yet. No, flattened while.

**This** second wave: Yup, fuck done insider trading. blatant insider trading I've ever seen (might one two instances 90s), nothing done. end people can't afford it. ones likely get sick insurance high risk. think insurance beholden cover cost vaccine. remember mindset back March. insignificant everything else looked, comparison monster door shared purpose fight it. shone light fact us connected, whether admit not.

Now, I’ve pushed right back pit apathy cynicism, it’s like didn’t try either. 

All watch monster feed. ... benefit genetic family, mother must labour, literally figuratively keep alive. Israeli side, whole West bank occupied territories belongs Palestinians Society/population also plays big role. USA trains best mental gymnists whole world. one make sense Nondisclosure crime anyone proven undetectable viral load, widely accepted can't transmit HIV undetectable viral load. y’all still complain ma. Jesus fuck. Can’t expect anything less though Long term health issues Covid19 lot extensive lung scars. Maybe write Oxford NIHR explain argument. UN council recognized countries world tries ensure countries uphold basic human rights best can. Israel violates treatment Palestinians, often reprimand Israel.


This isn’t true, UN consists plenty human rights abusers - countries decided better group vote according interests UN, creating blocs. 

The way went decades middle eastern countries wanted reprimand Israel via political pressure following failure winning wars Israel. 

I don’t believe things “propaganda”, UN ‘bias’ Israel well documented, it’s even controversial UN. 

Just give scale ridiculous is, statistics;

The UN human rights council total 135 resolutions countries. sum resolutions Saudi Arabia, Iran, Syria, North Korea, China and, actually - combine literally resolutions countries world - still less resolutions Israel. 135 resolutions - 50% Israel, around 70. 


The UN General Assembly around 97 resolutions 2012-2015 period - many Israel? 83. almost 90% entire resolutions. Previous years worse similar. 

UNESCO around 10 resolutions criticizing Israel per year. Israel nation ever criticizes - 100% resolutions countries 1945 since creations Israel - exception ONE Syria. 

The annual assembly, Israel singled condemned - country gets this. 

The ILO annual “Israel report” - it’s country specific report Israel - also criticizing it. 

We’re even really scratching surface issues since they’re deeply rooted system - consider fact human rights council includes freaking Eritrea Bahrain. featured Sudan Somalia - SOMALIA one criticizing Israel. 

It also included Saudi Arabia, Rwanda(half million dead civil war), around 20 countries way worse Israel ever has. believe whatever propaganda want.

When say sort thing, think may apply you. Ewwww listening talk turns stomach!! Fingers crossed daughter. Growing someone screaming you...sucks. lot more, really hard tell much more. New York city they've counted 20% positivity rate antibody test. So, add 2 millions not-counted-cases least. Anyone else half expected follow “and don’t forget buy support favorite beans company ....!“ ? seem live rational thought don’t like changes world seriously think US divided would good thing. would like Idiocracy rest us could watch TV show laugh. found 5 minutes googling, read 10, gave later day. There's reaaon every single fucking student country, exaggeration, complaining much zoom similar platforms suck learning. actually cared anything appearing right, research find plenty studies like one. sleep, find tomorrow think would good tonight well. ""We must reopen schools, costs.""

""Then us?""

""Shut up, COSTS!"" think really depends kind gym. 5 PM Tuesday? Nightmare. zumba class 10 spread entire basketball court? Probably bad. 
I go small gym 40 members. Class sizes limited 6, we're spaced 6 feet apart, equipment shared, big garage doors always open. figure probably medium risk. keeping going absolutely stir crazy. think I'd much harder time continuing stay away social events without it. I'm working home, rarely (maybe every month two) seeing friend family member. trade I'm making. creationists, Flinstones documentary. There's presidential election every four years. 1 4 exactly slim odds...  Where? tiny percentage “overcount” vastly dwarfed excess deaths. Americans think everything conspiracy theory? Isnt nyc like 20+%? actually read article - there’s huge section end incompatibility flu vaccine Johnson’s health advisors suggesting deployment Covid vaccine *after* end 2020-2021 flu season. always turn already thought knew correct. I’m thinking Donald trump setting something big close November get re-elected. could’ve done something wait it’s close election something. every fucking state goes beat drum. national system what’s covid death what’s death covid. report positives differently neighboring states. It’s literally biggest clusterfuck I’ve ever seen. second whole shit show became politically charged sides, fucked. guess what, happens I, along others fuck mode, wearing masks public indoors Anyone going well known store without mask point premeditated intention something like this. July 1st 2020 99th birthday CCP. Must 


/s?  Yeah, certain appeal lost teenage boys 2016, it’s sad see haven’t grown young adults, despite three half years shitshow.  Shhhhhhhhh. ^(don't tell him.) Florida currently trying depopulate. Genuine question. death rate .0016% among children, realize 56.6 millions kids go school US. equates 90000 deaths. even though would stop far many does, problem also number people survive inherited long term post viral inflammation May cases long term hard monitor micro clots. Imagine recovering disease left brand new preexisting condition know about?

I agree thos damaging kids. I'm worried happen kids mental health know brought home mom dad? Watch slowly suffer get taken hospital last time ever see skype..... real scenarios unfold friend. options suck complete ass... 

And keep making point kids bad home life understand really do. much worse would kids condition caretaker died disabled this? would go? top mental damage traumatic thing.... even one friends die?.... terrible. America. Home Bra-.... buried post Chapo means probably CCP Fans know! I'm bit terrified everyone really hard time. included. mainly due surge cases 10 days ago. We'll seeing 1000+ consistently bit now... Nice deepfake. Looks rather real, know Trump could never make much sense long clip real life. Nice try! airplane high risk? social distancing, absolutely everyone wearing masks times. mingling, touching movement. Air filtered. vectors see touching stuff toilets licking hands. actually planes seem quite safe. mean state tends stay home hurricane. course would bad pandemic. came Quebec result changing something active case / recovery reporting methodology. far know details released, immediately took 20k active cases changed recoveries. degenerates basically. Gee, feel better already. :| 

I know narcissist stopped wearing masks public pregnant wife. got covid. Neither super sick thankfully recovered. stopped wearing public parties friends going eat etc, got it, Narc fb criticizing others wearing masks acting like covid big deal. big deal happened him. point, care it.

and record anti-45. yall stop blaming 45 supporters Hey win man? “Literally nothing do”

Only ignore fact getting bad worse entirely preventable. Compassion . Altruism. Societal responsibility. Wear mask . Keep distance . maybe nameless, faceless person narcissistic self could care less won’t die Also alot consolidation occurs economic downturns. Lots investment firms collecting everything everyone loses rent back 1.5x 3x price. Ha! heard about. that. Pretty damn funny...and smart. biggest issue Covid turned political nightmare. wish United States real leadership Top wishy washy nonsense. Everyone ‘come together’ follow rules. faith humanity ceased (seriously) I’ve good run life would peace dying. feel sorry really want continue LIVING immunocompromised. Unfortunately, selfish, maskless jerks walking around, without one care anyone themselves, ones bringing country number 1 covid numbers.
No one knows long term effects virus; seen irreversible lung damage, organ issues, amongst others survive long term ramifications really?
We don’t know. You’re allowed opposing thought also allowed inform you’re disgusting person result. See works? don’t need academic report prove this, I’m glad there’s one prove it. Dimwit changing tune he's finally realizing largest support demographic dying.. jackass needs every vote get point.

100% self interest, usual. waste time. 31% demographics group show certain tendency call facts fake.   article notes, lab equipment. swabs, reagents, everyhing supply chain.

Funny, NBA, MLB, NFL, NHL, PGA, college sports programs problems getting supplies needed tests. That’s also government flaw country social safety nets, one partially trump it’s deeply rooted US state funded mandated time sick people forced isolation job protection along Seriously lack empathy compassion point think making? trend line bee consistently going lag, exactly predicted.

Things dropped country locked down.

Then locked down, numbers going again.

There causal relationship number infections number deaths. Infection go up, weeks later deaths go up. Infections go down, weeks later deaths go down. daily infections go back like time now, guess happens daily deaths?

Seriously, part confusing keep embarrassing like this?  mean ""you people""? I’ve wanted leave awhile now, last years really solidified idea me. realize nothing perfect anywhere, recently I’ve felt bigger disconnect country fellow Americans ever before. lot good lot bad too, don’t want deal bad anymore. want live somewhere feel proud citizen of, isn’t place. ideally end somewhere Central America live small, supportive, cultural community. Could Mexico, could Costa Rica...who knows. It’s immediate plan everything obviously air right now, future goal!  wife’s teacher like kids basically prison. Kids Socially distant,can’t groups, stuck room day, yelled constantly stay apart keep masks on..teachers don’t want there. Tensions high patience run thin I’m afraid. It’s sad kids don’t think parents realize it’s going rainbows butterfly’s. parents something say teachers teaching skills, turn ugly.
They evaluate everything quarterly bases..see everything vaccine status. Halloween, winter break, spring break about, know, church right now?? Yeah that's need government money. get hand fist government done... Students sit way closer together office workers cubicles. suppose vaccine could sure thing, even takes while. Imagine vaccine granted immunity coronavirus colds, due broad cross reactive immunity sick shit. need reference something like this, moron.. humble opinion.  25 total numbers, got 2 lol. Definitely lucky day! I'll stick hoping vaccine sooner later Nope ordered became public sold many Obama added stockpile (that trump raided) January people really think understand need chart? ""For study, researchers surveyed 755 individuals Poland March 15 29, 3rd 4th week governmental restrictions. found participants scored higher measure Dark Triad traits less likely engage preventive behaviors (such washing hands often leaving home unless necessary) likely engage hoarding behaviors.""...

This sounds like pretty unsound study, NGL. 100% back line need critical care body shutting down. Sorry assholes! “Oh no. need take crap” narc never stops thinks ""am jerk here?"" feel shame ever question whatsoever remember way back twenty-teens galavanted whenever wherever wanted to! Mother would never allow that. Wearing face shield, is. like Griffith gave Guts lollipop Eclipse. Coolcoolcoolcoolcoolcoolcool doubt funny thing me, mask wearing stranger around her, cares family does. she’d danger would family. protect people like don’t lift finger protect me. I’m diabetic would probably rough ride got it. funniest comment, like EVER, pissed myself. think it’s actually people Florida driving influx rental cars? feel like rental cars tend Florida plates. 😂 😂 😂

I can’t fucking breathe. take care other, even less intelligent. don't, everyone going lose, friend. No, not. 100k died first two weeks, everyone would terrified compliance, we'd able lockdown properly we'd already done now.

And population filled anti-intellectuals country run malicious moron, way we'd ever got compliance killed bunch people quickly.

The fact came spread slowly made everything much worse. quarter teachers US high risk, we're opening schools month, people scared enough yet. Awesome reality, California's cases may undercounted factor 5, whereas New York's cases may undercounted factor 20 more. Look difference deaths. March/April surge Northeast WAY bigger even current surge. difference mass testing available then, Northeast probing dark. one point, NY/NJ positive test ratios around 40%. respect you’re coming from, don’t consider equivalent. Singling license plate gross oversimplification issue (ignoring rentals, people recently moved, etc.). clear police bias matters US, expanding would risk lives more. 

Here “rule” absolutely isn’t fully enforceable. get caught, get fined. It’s like parking ticket. roll dice, okay. That’s choice. many people dissuaded fine. 

Also, forms you’re asked fill airport similar arrival cards filled arrive international flight. streamlines contact tracing required. Maybe he's suddenly making up? doubt crowd though, since also says people freedom it. must confused. California’s blue sky. 


It’s virus. It’s going seep whatever crack find literally nothing unless want never leave home 3 months come back waste land  always bought bulk stocked long started. got Sams Club membership year ago since getting large amounts food cleaning supplies paper products one time. changing pattern pandemic. 

Everyone buy bulk so. better environment less gas delivery trucks driving store. clear: Bill Stepien since first campaign. role White House senior political advisor informally supposed guy helping keep President line. listed certainly issues many face society move assist, paint picture majority, not. vast majority Millennials fine shown data. Could better? Sure! let's pretend EVERYONE starving barely making next payday.

No one compared wealthy elite minimum wage worker you. realize ALOT people fall two extremes. People incredibly short memories attention spans. one semi-decent thing month prior important election, he's golden.  people long term memory lobotomized gnat they’ll remember last thing rather everything wrong. ignorance showing. Unlike they’re actually wearing masks Gees, things really escalating strangest ways. I’m letting sports guys hook, Feds pushing Stafford Act reagents swabs March. always war Eastasia. SARS MERS coronaviruses. many common cold-like viruses. Bong Joon-Ho guy something special! keeps up... might win Oscar! Americans. humans. I'm unshocked shocking watch weep. Pay attention though, know reject first watch twice 👍🇺🇸 co-workers thinking going tubing New Mexico Rio Grande. really want go feel iffy would traveling TX NM New Mexico seems pretty clear wanting Texas tourists come NM. also mandatory two week quarantine. Co-workers seem think apply us since we'll socially distanced we're tubing I'm still paranoid. Also one people made fun young folks partying Spring Break despite quarantine, feel go tubing NM weekend... would become people made fun of.  


Am paranoid since outdoor activities seem low risk right sit one out? co-workers making feel like I'm overly cautious this. eVeNtS Including dumbass unelected Missouri governor. headline way article structured garbage science journalism. almost guaranteed leave impression 'official figures' seen reported days significant estimations true death toll claim true. 

The ONS total figures still *higher* PHE ones article about! trying add verification smoothing PHE's method messing time series worried lead overestimate deaths *in future* don't! article, jammed last 3 paragraphs! far ""Nobody knew would bad virus"" ""People saying everything right pandemic""? think mean appetizer Toilet paper bulk makes sense too. Especially you’re working home, don’t realize much work toilet paper really relied day. Although secret mini pack toilet paper garage case. always seem realize need buy right I’m run completely. Nice way prove you’re totally sane hoax conspiracy Masks don’t work Oh, look came around! short memory, flu always killed least 15 000 americans day year, even outside flu season one talks /s guess? Lol you’ve got two accounts don’t you. guess two accounts kind like friend, someone cares you. guess get way. hope you’re better days. know hard gets. Yeah, districts planning going back person month (for now... I’m fairly sure won’t actually happen) yet already multiple rumors (nothing news, reliable sources) entire summer school classrooms quarantine and, news, kids spreading like crazy summer sports practices. don’t know think going happen we’re trapped inside hundreds kids (who social distance, matter tell them) day long. country holding elections year multiple countries Presidential election 2020. hear kind talk them?. try avoid listening anything says. I'm saying opposite, pay mind whatsoever. agree Dr. Peter Hotez; clear White House running coordinated misinformation campaign, safest thing America disregard anything comes Well keeps shitting Cali lifting entire US shoulders. think gonna happen. like bile I'm good gallbladder. I'm ok losing kidney. figure two. assisting liver anyway. I'm biologist, guy offered grand minor surgery. Worse, since kids staff 7+ hours, 5 days week. That's fair point also think important remember US isolated, virus litteraly everywhere. remaining steady 65-70k last week least right? think numbers already plateaued like remained around 30-33k while. like narcissistic personalities running coranavirus reedit scare campaign Maybe they’re actually visible, start conversation mental health people personality disorders? raise kids often recourse protection—many narcissists stick destroying victims mentally/emotionally rather beating them, CPS couldn’t care less. sucks. 

Signed, one (adult) kids. Im assuming mental illness mean, see happened AstraZeneca announced vaccine would made loss, stocks plummeted, even great phase 1 2 results released, US would get CEO removed. live Phoenix AZ. AC thing keeping cooking myself. 🤣 It’s longest shots, trump spins american mask culture we’re able live reduced numbers vaccine... glory office. 

Should happened lightyears ago? Yup. care anything except COVID reduction right now? Hell. No. fix damn country unify please. 




Edit: forgot answer question Yes, fucking coincidence, 50% chance, election every 2 years. Wow wild watching trajectory sub. 

I joined sub early March late February covid shit ""began"" wanted latest info virus. Definitely got first awesome... somewhere along line went informative posts comments priggish, sanctimonious comments bashing dissenting views. 

Seems like r/coronavirus got infected hateful, echo-chamber strangers r/politics. 

Downvotes expected.  paranoid yes problem lower legs feet swelling, wear shoes. doctors loss, tests everything checked normal. yet felt like near death. somewhat athletic, was, forcing move, keep moving, matter exhausted painful movement was. four hour stay ER cost insurance company $7,600. heart goes without medical coverage.  love way think. Oh god entire state Florida red... along South Carolina Alabama. actually see outlines states red that's genius plan bypassing CDC comes play. can't increases numbers getting fudged top *taps head* Absolutely delusional. wear mask, 60 rolls TP. mess! 

This article seem lot truth tho. evil world UN made mission spend 90% work Israel. tiny country tries survive thrive surrounded hostile region. UN driven hostile countries tremendous ironic thing actually cared themselves, they'd wear damn mask. 

Even nobody else wears one, would still substantially cut risk. 11 midnight neck woods. apparently misinformation campaign works. Amazing reality distortion field. Repeat something long enough people believe it. Amazing facts like death matter opinion now.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* im pretty sure youre wrong since, iirc, us intel intercepted chinese wires, mean chinese officials us intel page   Question, South Korea differently allow high level testing? take stand this, pressuring visit them, sorry that's bad family dynamic go, get sick visit cards turn make family dynamic worse. cut trying keep family safe, deal it, eventually see things go back normal. would rather lose contact parents live consequences getting loved ones sick. think best estimate total deaths month per region 2020 minus avg total deaths month per region previous 10 years. difference would Covid deaths.

The deaths obviously higher reported. Many people died home without even making hospital. That's borderline, bipolar. IIRC borderline also develop response trauma. poll numbers dropping faster mouth cheeseburger. care fetus, want mother say happens it. think there’s real chance secession time. one mind. Yep. approval rates dropping abysmal handling pandemic (here's hoping go soon.) he's trying save face, tell people wear masks try win back supporters. Basically; he's ass. Imagine headlines would pissed dicks. One major symptoms first discovered COVID irresistible temptation go world tour. Every country better job controlling this, well almost every country. Brazil mimicking US, deep shit too. people saying ""Trumpvirus"". Trump making things worse US. Many people going die inability lead us effectively. First world country I'm Washington state. Signed test online ~ 5 p.m., test delivered door next day, courier picked 2 hours later, results within 2-3 days. free.

If could take every medical test way, I'd ecstatic. It’s complicated discussion. It’s clear government officials letting virus spread don’t care healthcare workers. AKA Fox News Nation 
AKA Trump’s base 3 months, finally. Lol  Sorely outnumbered. *shakes fist Kim Reynolds* Flatten curve, flatten curb...same thing, right? quarrel raw numbers idea “it’s little bit scary.” Since it’s impossible know either widespread effects become time likely individual person experience them, don’t think worried outcomes unreasonable way talking point implies. know what, feel great it, somewhere way depths soul *know* comment deserves upvote. Damn you. Oh yeha people sub chicken littles lots time.

But i'm even american know testing bottlenecked texas florida cases per day relatively flat even though expect cases least doubling weekly. thank you! hear one teacher Reddit tell selfish want child go back school gonna lose it. school want infographic thrown around highly contentious back school debates. memorial weekend deaths, july 4th weekend beginning August  It’s new thing, took test last week nyc got results within 5 days Yes they’re similar. difference orange guy hit parent wealth lottery. Would interesting see protesting attending school chart Chonavirus? family Corpus surprised higher numbers sooner. Naval Air Station, Padre Island, Padre Staples Mall...or La Palmera now? 
Hell, even SPID packed days surprise stuck traffic super spreader event. So, telling people think - think themselves??? Surely jest! that’s people lived!  asian disease gives different meaning chinese virus. Since came China makes sense. Calling Asian virus sounds pretty damn racist  High correlation, absolute causal relationship. country epidemic situation serious, tracking, lot people exchanges China Europe?

Plus mystery flu going around us November many researchers suggested. Corona circulating months discovered Wuhan, obscured flu season.



The U.S. much closer herd immunity mainstream media ""experts"" would believe. Oh absolutely right. that's need foundational change -- stop happening. Pentagon wants keep wasting money, taxpayers let it. Whatever takes. majority anti mask league membership died within span pandemic. Go figure. Low/Medium, Low. wish couldn’t read. Someone watching Czech Fantasy... polls toilet. really care.  Yeah remember, ""recovered"" catchall - serious viral infections kind often present lifelong problems sometimes debilitating conditions. honestly think 1/3 number low. Many, many people I've met almost conception states laid out. pretty nuts honest. proves point even further, virus actually come china, makes sense call Chinese Virus. I'm taking side, say mother works U.S. hospital, every death remote possibility COVID related reported COVID death, hospital makes money per death basis. 11 children, including 2-month old. dont experience using app, self-quarantined SK. points mentioned above, shows strict self-quarantine imposed SK, think SK ppls feel safer knowing this. :-| ""It's [old/young/fat/black/lizard] people anyway!!""

I always point people Trump 74 years old morbidly obese. :shocked face: Ah yes, clearly work Secret Shadow Presidents Obama Hillary. went one health + hospitals free testing sites near ft. Greene park got active antibody test results back day - wait either. YMMV guess 100% agree. Well put. vague, argument sounded claiming overall amount people dying decreasing. using argument reopening schools, complaining rest media unfair still focusing covet despite numbers dropping instead giving attention shooting Chicago.

It damn ride. Soon somebody arguing mortality rate children acceptable amount. “I never said anti-mask. pro-mask along! show screenshots contrary say, it’s fake news!” featured infographic yesterday Gotta wonder Intel got made concede point. Yes, approval rating, think maybe there's something else it. fact states notoriously late reporting New York: got confirmed cases US.

California: Hold mask. worse that, even people would theoretically choice, don't. Asshats like Elon Musk opening early *in defiance of* lockdown orders actually legal teeth, means they'll laugh ""suggested"" lockdown.

You necessarily need _that_ much asshole -- lockdown would literally drive bankruptcy, that's lot harder pill swallow *suggested* lockdown. convince okay fire anyone come work (even work home rest executive team), ""no one holding gun head"" bullshit.

All means lot thoroughly nonessential workers faced *suggestion* either come work risk Corona lose jobs.

Making mandatory really way get Corporate America value human lives profits short term. mean degree good reason stop opening schools state pretty much stays open. Like futile imo. resteraunts gatherings allowed stop schools. least equally applied. IE schools closed restaurants. jurisdictions, assault and/or battery person age 65 automatically felony. 

Besides which, attacking little old lady makes one candidate r/iamapieceofshit. I've thinking regarding wild fire season. premise forced evacuations coupled premise tracking least mildly containing pandemic seems laughably impossible. feel like I've missing something... ""Rest world"" 

Or basically UK.

The country scale testing per capita US. Unless want count Russia, really trust numbers? GTFO I'm sad say can't tell sarcastic due comments thread. Wow! hope doesn’t last! Good luck!!  keep updating Yeah. I've basically stockpiled items, mostly empathy instead narcissism:

If stockpile items, keep amount times leave house minimum, thus would able practice social distancing well possible. wonder wait time results though demand may high. Narrator: *they ran out* news story get clicks. Anyone brain means mean much, need go deeper numbers determine actually means. terrible obviously, true Giant police grocery stores enforce aisle directions? This, interest contracting COVID SIP’ed exception weekly grocery trip, like half dozen socially distanced outdoor hangouts single friend narrative “but long term effects!” seems bit alarmist.

At point appears manifest small amount infected short breath/low energy/without smell taste 3 mos undoubtedly shitty it’s death sentence part anecdotal evidence seems suggest 3-4 mos limit. Time shut again. Maybe selfish fucks actually listen time. guess point arguable.
 I'd say yes is, rather small. hope goes well you. 

Wish best fast full recover. broke quarantine order yes crime. quarantined flu broke would also crime. say “test positivity rate.” It’s misleading lack specificity. Moreover metric generally misleading availability, requirements cost testing varies widely different communities. Test positivity rate mainly useful give rough idea infection rate trends specific community time. don’t understand don’t large-scale, random seroprevalence testing point.  Rents high here, wages low.

San Luis Obispo (20 miles lady lives) [#1 entire country list people paying rent relative 43.43% renters spend 50% household income rent. Total literally don’t fucking spit people. third can't find Louisiana map.

Aren't missing much tbh Americans. Happens everywhere. makes worse social media like Facebook like echo chambers them. That's get information that's also get feeling majority people think like them. frustrating every normal human being.. Inoculation dose Time bring back shunning. Question - guys sort antigen testing? ELISAs, etc? not, know not?  Weird flex, ok. Never fear fellow pedant, effort counts. Although I’m technically right, would proud share victory anyone else shows grace defeat.

Go forth bother people “um, actually” like :)

Take care well  air travel high risk? cabin air highly filtered changes frequently hospital. medium low risk category.  thought catering base (by ignoring deviant virus virus liberal Democrat) would improve poll numbers. didn't. 140,000 died covid. covid. 30-40% population rally right starve death gutter.

“Stop popping babies” Dude. never heard pro-life bullshit? Also, way show ignorance chaotic life actually is. 

Primary example - one best friends’ raised grandparents life shitty. also raise 4 sisters, 3 cousins. 3 bedroom home, US, major city. Learn world live in. Outdoor protest mask lower risk (especially socially distant), outdoor protest without mask probably medium, indoor protest mask higher risk, indoor protest mask highest. Doesn’t cause. I’m high risk heart defect autoimmune disorder. way, schools would going back period. I’m peon within district one first chopping block bc I’m going year 4.

I autoimmune disorders LEFT precisely I'm undesirable. found better job -- 100% remote higher pay. What's excuse graduate degree 2 undergraduate degrees science, I’m science teacher, WHOLE HEARTEDLY (better average Joe) understand ramifications unknowns disease presents people age groups.

Uh-huh. Hence barely communicate written logical forms. repeated caps lock lines, means “CDC“ screaming me. I’m used people life able write, forget plenty people still write like middle schoolers. Houston extremely liberal empathetic city. consistently one of, the, philanthropic cities United States, first lesbian mayor major metropolitan area country.

I think deserves unjust implication citizens cheering New Yorkers died taking seriously, given long they've pushing serious measures taken around virus. They're victims this, too. Deserves lawsuit. live Greeneville, surprise all. Maybe 3rd people came work tonight mask on. tried get owners close dining room go curbside said governor ok fine...yep, rooms fire we're throwing gasoline it. Bill Lee probably worst governor yet. would like admit. don’t tell him. camera going show up.  went dentist month ago secretary wearing mask, chairs waiting room distanced (there 3 people waiting) assistants mask on(no shield) dentist even mask talked (before looking teeth)
The woman cleaned teeth tried make conversation schools opening(I work school) like, ""I think really need get back normal""
The whole experience shocked me. Turns virus going virus matter hard spin anti-science message. Yep. BYOP now. Yeah you’re attempting say diagnosis squeezed ****death**** reports “pad” numbers.

Again, what’s incentive pad ****death**** numbers?

It’s even remotely logical.

Swap around say “hospitals falsify overreport live COVID patients order convince govt give money treatment” got conspiracy theory (barely) makes sense.

Trying say get bonus money dead bodies simply moronic. Obviously wasnt enough since Cali surpass NY months later. shocking he's finally recommending wearing mask, even shocking thing sound like complete moron once. huge accomplishment him. won’t ever wearing worthless mask period still support Trump everyone rabid Blind supporter like Fascist Leftists identity politics propaganda BS like 9/11 happened election year... oh wait. (i'd love hit retort) Yeah. I've home months constantly (highschool student) Mental Health down, better getting sick spreading infection. Sadly one gives shit incarcerated people general, regardless reason there. 

I live immigration detention center one largest outbreajs country stories coming absoutely appalling.  Pretty good forgot beans. Without federal wide response go state level look waves.  look current closed cases states 8%. rest world may mortality rate, look talking about

Edit : 7% point still holds Nah plenty capitalist countries Nordic model fine. I’m worried we’re going learn it’s enough. That’s huge ass range would assume 24x would place like Texas, Florida, Arizona. 6x place like Colorado Becuz stupid karens like covid become major issue.

Me fresher college student, excited made lot plans college started. I'm sitting home attending online classes. planned much college, ruined becuz people like her. wrong believing ghost, demon, spirits etc actually..


its scarry... Diagnosis considered death, death considered diagnosis. 

Agreed, results would near 100%, know, [like  commercial spaces residential well? Don' throw moron jail, waste tax payer money. 

Make perform janitorial duties hospital area/wing Covid patients cared for. give mask begs, crying it. coworker awaiting results test recently guess went 4th...the fucking lake. Posted social media. Unreal. performances empathy alligator tears Oscar-worthy... [These article near beginning presidency saying use small sentences insert name every often keep interest briefs. He's child.  Says who? Many NYC public hospitals house labs testing. Seriously, Japanese government?

What hell? think people need realize last 24 hours. Everyday NJ adding deaths June. Last week reported 9 deaths, 2 happened June, 2 previous 24hrs. means two things...when states going up, likely worse what's represented, going down, likely bad. even recently added 1,900 probable deaths since March timeframe.

Counting positives tests, Hospitalizations, deaths pretty complex. best data point Hospitalizations hospitals self report states DOH every day/night. Deaths certificates need issued need reviewed categorized, takes time, reviews make, worse lag. also noted worst 24hr period NJ 428 deaths. going another painful slow decline, hopefully sooner rather later. going probably sound retarded but... deaths caused things virus also added count long confirmed someone even asymptomatic ? shit, Sherlock create paradox? basically lying. kind God thinks cool infect others? Also trying best avoid jail. knows another 4 years would give immunity enough time replace prosecutors with...""his best people"" (just like fbi cdc) Trump toilet paper? 🧻 likely 10x many actual cases tested cases. ability produce testing kits limited much $$ round build capability. Opportunity knocks! mother grandma exactly same-right alcoholic husbands nothing stop worked time get away leaving kids mercy disordered mother. easy though mother nice person.

Have tried EMDR? helped lot! Sort of. said accept elections, push mail ballots, see why. Honestly, Trump win, think will, left blame mail ballots.

Some recent examples: Jan already said health emergency countries needed prepare detect contain back January basically repeating urgency pretty much weekly countries needing get prepared test detect Uh, ordered coffee...   non-stupid governments globe paying people work it’s safe.

We country full people choose safety survival. sit call stupid can’t figure feed kids without going job. Sounds like kids living cousins aunts/uncles/grandparents. Translation: he's boycotting masks past six months like wearing one. damn time! Oddly enough 666 comments wrote this.   WTAF? Florida voted Bush, Trump Corona fiasco guys really well known narcissistic hates masks.... nothing article states can't done.

These H+H sites specifically public use labs. specific article cites average turnaround time 1 3 days state labs. private labs causing issue. ACA made using pre-existing conditions disqualifier insurance coverage illegal. However, refuse cover pre-existing conditions that's nearly bad. Thank you, I’m glad appreciate it. Empathy humility two traits appreciative taught life, whether parents objective obvious not. lazy hell, overly distracted everything days, procrastinate ton it’s hard focus lately, end day, goal wrote really linchpin every day I’m alive right now. add list 👋 I'm going third party year. antibody tests reliable yet? someone works data statistics every day, it’s life’s mission good enough communicating data stakeholders don’t look eye say “stats mean nothing”.

It’s tough communicate uncertainty statistics response strong anecdote true. need immunity science. Ironically guy looks like sees bottom Doritos bags would know. This. cant enforce quarantine without guarantee livelihoods wont affected, includes salary stay home, positive,caring kids ensuring still employed recover.


This would apply even without kids. We're getting sick *from* American shit.  brought flaws stupid corrupted work / health system light.   
She prob pick keep working bring food table.   
Stop working stay home sick lose house job.   
Well easy pick Agreed. School like 5th level, stupidly high risk. learn hard way, painful lot people. Must doesn’t affect people protesting police “Might.” What? owe anyone money, work hard take pride work also use money pay things debt (like vacations). Especially considering turned made ""patriots"" look like complete idiots. how? Didn’t isolate? Seems people don’t get virus household long infected person isolating, no? Good way ""slow testing""... spikes protests? SF didn’t spike them. Chicago didn’t seem either. 4% maybe 30% people. that.

The 60-70% world perfectly happy lock down, wear masks socially isolate outside.   crux even article. Pfizer wants profit without federal help - fine. really dick move capitalism, maybe little.

To receive federal help still profit it. Major dick move. Maybe affect USas much Merck lagging behind. Still, Moderna relatively track think. Looking distance perspective, it’s actually kind scary easy would’ve take neutral stance it. political fate would’ve absolutely 180° now. Even deaths large case numbers, decent honest country, rational respecting Science, chances reelection would’ve much higher right now. It’s spectacular much fucking screwed up. Maybe government something take public transportation don’t feel unsafe, mostly people riding live now. (Usually 1-3 people entire bus) Someone probably crunched numbers realized much could make campaign themed masks finally. Religious freedom greatest! doubt reach New York’s deaths. check CDC's data, number pneumonia deaths many states WAY up, 300-500% cases. surprised see stable death rates general. lets say last 10 years given state normally 450-500 pneumonia deaths per year, year even state 3000 pneumonia related deaths? cannot ignored. recorded hospitals label person died covid (car crash, stroke) covid death antibodies. Shame 94 years old still doesn’t enough money retire.   That's good, something wanted while....as opposed feeling pushed everything that's going right now.

At point, started looking ahead 2021 next year would feel normal again. every time think that, next thought 2021 might normal either....as in, knows what's coming next. 

I hope everything works you. meantime, stay safe there.  Also, world leaders going immediate access top-level care leading-edge treatments us commoners won't. I'm pretty sure president genuinely thinks recent Daily Podcast people view possible vaccine really eye opening.

Half people r/coronavirus ""not me, first"" attitude talked podcast. see ""yeah i'll wait little bit get vaccine"" ""i'm gonna take Oxford vaccine"" type comments see here. Thank you. really dislike confrontation (it makes anxious stressed), worried gullible misinformed friends family believe stuff others sharing. And, I’ve friends spamming “facts” conspiracy theories via messages / emails. I’m so, concerned upcoming election want get reasonable person elected. misinformed. Look San Francisco It’s almost like one complete total moron, control hostile foreign government worried re-election deaths million countrymen elected protect. Almost. April switched online semester finished. May called telling school would online Fall. June call say they've changed mind would require full on-campus attendance. Right 4th July called asked would ""prefer"". flat told online. 

Her guess overwhelming amount faculty gave university shit caved offered choice. kinda crux issue, aside covid. Say anything contrary echo chamber everyone assumes youre sociopath incapable empathy/love etc. ok, understand. 
 
I say though, leaders approached safety practices side ""patriotic"" whole ordeal would different. Except course protests riots common last 60ish days. Disclaimer: family never tested active infection late February/early March began get bad, due limited number test kits available state time, strongly suspected included probably number cases county. 

I starting see long term effects: stage 2 COPD, however, ever cough morning subsequent shortness breath coughing. Lasts hour get bed. Except both. shortness breath begins soon open eyes morning eventually cough sets in, day. still break sweat going stairs home, definitely new. moments utter confusion, reason them. middle adding numbers making list I've head three days, forget middle calculation even middle word doing. (I stroke 11 years ago, confusion brain fog worse 72 hours following stroke. hits, hits.) Neurology find cause appear second stroke point. Scariest all, still experience petechial bruising arms, chest legs. random spot skin itch, absentmindedly scratch it, watch purple dots break skin bruises. painless, occurs without extreme pressure trauma. common causes, low iron cancer ruled out. initial symptoms 3 days fever 104 gastrointestinal distress (both ends). less full day shortness breath, symptoms set couple weeks following ""recovery"" yet resolve.  


As rest family, one show ill effects initial illness 7 year old. spiked fever initial illness would come medication, eventually resorted wet washrags cold packs hospital. 24 hours 103, hitting high 105.4, finally broke, cough low oxygen saturation started, lasted 2 days. Since then, randomly spiked fever symptom. 101-103, lasts 12 hours, respond medication, he's it. Unless notice feels warm, can't even tell fever. 

So, honestly, symptoms far surprise any. surprised people do, attribute allergies another condition already had.  friend works Pfizer. Interestingly, CEO went saying wouldn’t profitable endeavor, they’re pushing forward anyway. No- everyone encouraged get tested. can’t tell whether something flu vs covid history. Everyone even mildest symptoms - blocked nose, slight itchy throat tested   bet still time stupid tik tok dances though. What? claiming death rate 1/3 was? You’re full it. don’t understand hospitals work. work epidemiological data hospital. watched someone almost get fired accidentally sending test patient result (just used testing hospital information system) state daily positive count. literally thousand eyes every test result make sure shit like you’re saying doesn’t happen. Fingers crossed got enjoy good concert least. Worth lives. worked shopping mall permitted work got results back. hadn’t really shown symptoms still allowed work (which happy could asymptomatic time). use sick time week too. 

I’m furloughed shopping malls aren’t open due rise cases CA. 

I feel like case since work home you’d still work actually developed symptoms. I’m 100% sure though would mostly depend company work for’s protocol. it? 

Am lying fact masks work work? 

Who's one changing tune now? vaccinated measles, very, difficult catch measles. vaccinated, exposed someone else it, almost impossible catch it.

That’s dispute. MMR vaccine one one guy claimed caused autism, that's cases measles US, people believed baked study instead dozens studies since support claims.

According CDC measles outbreaks due travelers small populations aren’t vaccinated. There’s indication reasons aren’t vaccinated. show study explores reasons I’d happy read supports it’s due anti-vaxers I’d happy accept that. doubt anti-vaxers anything immediately obvious targets. going happen, people taking seriously, would imagine wearing mask must keeps getting bad rate, non-essential businesses shut possibly close shop good. literally worked every developed country so...

Maybe Americans stupid lockdown properly. 45 rise age death maybe. Sure gamble take though previously unknown virus. one saying air filters going stops spread 100%. However I'd go there, home depot, 100% open everyone touching everything, zero restrictions amount people going out. 

And literal bubble person inside it, prevent spread? get covid 19 literally alone? Please answer that. 

It seems argument every possible indoor activity matter what, isnt happening begin with. Either masks social distancing answer, never open, solution. Yeah antibacterial resistant bacteria one biggest looming public health threats. Imagine bubonic plague bacteria became somehow antibacterial resistant. We'd fucked. get. mean there's whole world outside US struggling get handle it. People died. Lots people. could anyone think real? Brit laughed, cried. Trump never issue federal lockdown. 

Unless he's sure he's going loose election. 

Then he'll issue nation wide stay home order November 1st. Sadly not. crazies. 

However, strong bulk people reasonable enough accept government decisions based scientists. commented pathetic memorial day performance south things would bad 4th July got lots caps little letters replies. response horrendous end June deaths would take month start registering charts. sure giving police rights obligations force people wearing masks going right direction.... necessarily, gulf Middle East countries lagging numbers make look like cases increasing. top massive reopening, opening international flights. many people talking it. real pro mask required laws gulf countries.

 I'll try finding source bit. patients worked saw great improvements follow visits, tell works lol You’re making classic logical fallacy, false equivalency. diseases comparable. Bubonic Plague result bacterium. Covid-19 result virus. different. real comparison make smallpox. fantastic job eliminating smallpox, higher R0 Covid-19 virus. However, smallpox doesn’t issue asymptomatic spread degree, antibodies smallpox last years. Currently don’t much evidence antibodies lasting longer months year COVID. may end correct end, can’t really compare bacterium virus way. every hear popping new york sewers Oh midnight read (australian time) didn’t see “more” bit. Yeah work doctor. test ask specifically. lot tests knocked back beginning plus they’re stool PCRs anymore due using reagent tend ask respiratory viruses sparingly It’s Florida. expect? Intelligent life? Lol thank x100 Time go stock TP. surprised shortages hit again. second wave always inevitable. Hong Kong getting hit hard right now, pretty well Spring. thought this, past weeks since went effect local stores went ~30% mask usage ~90% mask usage.

Social programs outlined federal level state adopts program varying degrees, all. programs like Social Security (retirement, disability) strict variation state (however states personal income tax may tax social security income states not.

So, USA problems since began, really went waterfall Trump administration. Interesting sister son undergoing cancer treatment oncologist said coronavirus affecting cancer kids caught nearly bad flu. major city's children's cancer unit. told needed much worried October flu season comes around.

I wonder age difference. Amputation. flu also doesn’t often cause strokes, lifelong lung damage neurological conditions many patients never fully recover.

Actually does. I'm researcher studying therapies respiratory viruses (and COVID) focus cytokine storm. known, major part flu pathophysiology since basically forever, leads imbalances serum levels many proteins causes thrombosis clotting fairly often.

COVID pathophysiology really interesting diversions flu (like lymphopenia), part COVID like influenza way likely cause serious side effects like pneumonia + ARDS + cytokine storm.

Obviously lot know COVID. Also, point 8 months \~3 months since major volume infections hit worldwide, early tell much damage lifelong. Strokes whatnot, yes obviously. lung damage, it, likely small amount. neurological damage, complete toss up. assumption people vote even care first place.

They'll either dismiss fake news perpetrated liberal media vote anyway alternative would voting liberal. knew phased reopenings joke bars restaurants included earliest phases. last reopen. Like 6 months it’s safe reopened. understood. virus could mutate slightly deadly (but appears mutated slightly less)

You hear me. Here's another paragraph May article many places **the new strain** appeared, quickly infected far people earlier strains came Wuhan, China, **within weeks strain prevalent nations**, according report. new strain’s dominance predecessors suggests **more infectious**, according report, though exactly yet known.

[COVID-19 Antibodies Disappear 2-3 Months Nahhh. like 10-15% right wing idiots. Many conspiracy crazies. Funny enough also left wing radical anti-american conspiracy nuts, far fewer.

The good thing right wing party AfD freaking stupid looked like total fools crisis. party leader demanded parliament lift restrictions weeks ago like Texas. Considering premature re-opening played several US states look like bunch greedy wannabe granny-slaughteres, established major anti-science party, together climate change denialism.

This milieu annoying. today met one man rambling Bill Gates conspiracy basis youtube-crackpots. Thank God rest sane Germans rather listens state media actually giving voices real scientists epidemiologist consensus treat people like mentally challenged. must say really like state media, make lot shitty TV content science reporting deserves praise. like three regular podcasts weekly 1 1 interviews virologists epidemiologists. renowned discoverer SARS sr. Christian Drosten, also advisor federal government.

In general reporting well transported humanitarian crisis Italy France. Also overhyping cures. much better German commercial media. think that’s intrinsic contagious number number function we’re currently social distancing. number website would spike went back normal. least that’s understanding terminology (not doctor). asshole agenda. They're pieces shit think Bolsonaro takes first place. He's way dumber well. Well exactly far treatment goes. take tamaflu end hospital flu, typically come alive. way there's another widespread lockdown. Mask mandates closing bars, indoor dining, etc yes. Huh? let 15 year old whatever go dance cause flu have? Implying one would ever drink other. hope  I'm arguing idea. government needs provide support people can't (or shouldn't) work due industries. However, think targeted better people actually need it.

My wife good, stable jobs remotely since March, still got $2,900. donated Covid relief programs, still seemed unnecessary.

All said, money directed towards testing absolutely minuscule compared scale needed support people working. Like difference $2 trillion versus $20 billion. much different probably reference one discussing other. they? Would help reopened schools full capacity mask requirement?


Let’s try see. lose? Go place take two weeks process then. got mine 24 hours 1/4 African Americans Thankfully, New York allow overnight camps summer. Also make masks mandatory spaces fines one, matter stupid people are.

That doesn’t work. Local sheriffs refuse enforce state mandates already. sounds like testing right now, agreement US supplied pass testing. I'm disgusted, surprised.   Caaaaalifoooorniaa reeest iiiiin peeeace. 
Rhcp, anyone? Haha edited couple mins posted. meant says now, things *aren't* going well. Sure, location matters. Boston, protests started early reopening stages. 

I familiar scope protests Florida Arizona. call ask covid infectious enough silent enough asymptomatic cases pre-symptomatic silent infectious period make like measels. We'll eliminate large portions, it'll remain long time. Yes Australia - work doctor Australia say much worse March/April? tell, almost exactly amount infected people, half death rate much closer vaccine. price gougers certainly *deserve* sued, I'm sure 3M legal standing so. Sounds like absolutely solid course.  anything, imagine already much better equipped engage politics many Americans.  IMO, smarter folks tend also humble aware limitations - that's sounds like are.

Keep good work! Many many many people are. r/loseit inundated people terrified way coronavirus decimates overweight people great things lose weight. paranoid hypochondriatic Thanks correction. read day $200. others thread pointing out, necessarily enough vaccinate even entire human population virus non-human reservoir. Got it.  Lol it’s interesting hear states mandated this. months Chicago. kids formula fed turned absolutely fine. think people would realize important thing babies fed growing. hope they'd realize lucky live time place safe, effective substitute breast feeding giving babies good start life. guess lucky hosptial 3 kids supportive either decision wanted make sure educated matter route took. formula mixing bottle sterilizing class bottle feeding moms nurses never made us feel bad. found formula coupons us sent us home bottles, several cans formula choice, bottle brushes, travel bags rest supplies. breastfeeding moms classes I'm sure consisted of.

All say--what matters kid loved fed. decided go feeding infants nobody's business partner's, making choices worked best family nothing feel guilt over. people desperate feel like leg someone else unfortunately bottle feeding target breastfeeding mothers feel superior cover insecurities. People secure choices feel need others theirs. I'm sure seen play multiple aspects life-the truly confident people stop give encouraging word helping hand needed. insecure people stop sneer hopes inner doubts drowned little while. I've also seen play vaginal vs c-section birth again, thing matters mom baby made okay. cares baby arrived long family okay healthy?

You well making sure baby fed loved. matters end.  Herd-vulnerability. hope right, we've lost far many people already. looked hosp stats, can't speak them, certainly relevant, however think needed ""peer review ready"" argument answer question worse April. April peak mostly limited locations, majority states showing increased cases, recently, support leadership one simple act makes major difference spread, cases went nuts. really hope people start wearing masks whole, maybe next spring things settle down. even fatality rate Falls miniscule number, still idea long-term effects are. adding multiple thousands cases per day bad situation regardless outcome death. know someone infected March still can't smell. Seems like minor thing really idea neurological implications disease lasting effects. even jobs.

And one reasons America shit greatest country world.  “We best tests world” -Trump

Eeeeeeeeeeeehhhh........  Due reagent used test respiratory viruses/covid/stool PCR. prioritise ask covid. beginning pandemic would ask respiratory viruses COVID would test covid due lack reagent. test asked specifically. they’re stool PCRs anymore all. true infection first time, mild second time. 

Based exactly? exist viruses contracting second time lethal survived fine first time. Dengue instance.   Thoughts + prayers Lolol 

That says masks don’t work. 

Lolololol

Reading comprehension memory clearly low 

Who first group say masks don’t work? 

Drum roll please.......


The government.

And fuck say wearing masks? fuck say lying say wear them? didn’t think so. I’m glad platform reasonably discuss. opinion comment?  “You see, would mat would put floor... would different CONCLUSIONS could JUMP TO.”

“That’s worst idea I’ve ever heard life, Tom.”

“Yes, horrible, idea.” depends mask.. every single company putting masks proprietary cloth blends. say ones mechanix, hard hell breathe in. throwing things right trash. Ok guys stop giving gold wrong people lol almost laughed kids school said big kids stay outdoor tents December. Dumbasses refused open early allow long xmas break, though. number years would get debilitating abdominal pain, gone. course need fairly low histamine diet, artificial colors preservatives. Eat small meals often. doctor given small supply anti-nausea drugs case. face flushing anymore either. lists acceptable low histamine foods line.

If want read Quercetin, quite bit info line. might want go National Institutes Health page, believe time, Quercetin taken Vitamin C best way to.combat MCAS. also take antihistamine every day. take 20 mg Zyrtec daily, 10 mg., lesser problem condition. since MCAS causes elevated serum tryptase blood, morph full blown mastocytosis, serum tryptase blood test done yearly, compromise bone marrow cause blood cancer. actually Monoclonal Mast Cell Activation Syndrome. could cause multiple myeloma leukemia. year go Dana Farber Cancer Institute Boston, Ma.

When saw post remembered science article read, knowing organ damage done Covid, activating large quantities bodies chemicals harmful, decided send post. 

I also read report Singapore hospital observed patients took supplemental Magnesium, Vitamin B6, and
Vitamin D, recovered much sooner people take supplements. Hope helpful.🙂 two major parties rarely anyone worth voting for. Example 1: next presidential election. Example 2: last presidential election No.

Not going away means like Polio, Measles, Shingles, Rubella.

Those still there, significant impact peoples daily lives we've got control.

(So long antivaxers dont get way....) Totally wasnt packed people protesting #blm. spaced outdoor restaurants!!!! people drive insane Aww, wanna move America get shithole Australia. feel controlled government, giving free education, healthcare, support payments pandemics. want freedom choice either paying life savings get burst appendix removed, dying dignity negative-equity house borrowed 150% value buy (not including using 12 platinum credit cards)! Well well well... turntables Maybe blood clots major organs good thing! Maybe we'll get superpowers! suck less California states (like Texas), they're basically regressive wealth tax hits middle class poor harder rich.

I mostly agree this. I'm sure better way is...I've heard things like Georgism may offer least partial solution, unlikely ever get ""Low tax"" states need funding, too, rearrange make room marketing slogan. ""Low tax"" means low income tax.

I disagree slightly, lot ""low tax"" states consider fixed percentage income taxes state local levels low. low apply every dollar make especially fall certain income tax brackets. actually wind paying less California depending upon tax bracket fall into.

However, also exactly saying take income tax, aggressive regressive taxation models property. think mostly agree.

Cheers! intention accurately portray facts. 

A virus hovers infects non-human species also become endemic. Highly virulent strains virus may less likely transmitted due death host, logic apply current viral case because, example, kids may transmitting virulent strains virus affect less cause worse health outcomes people comorbidities '09 H1N1 one seasonal flus last year. another endemic flu Care try set aside strawman? You’re welcome provide helpful links, though urge read commenting, silly. Yes, data reflect even higher mortality rate elders, expected point, imo, due increased health age risks higher risk infection. 

The findings line serology surveys. 

Also link: new study finds mortality risk highest among older adults, IFR 4.67 percent 65-74-year-olds 13.83 percent 75+ year-olds. Younger people far lower chances dying disease: 0.011 percent among younger 25 0.12 percent among 25-44-year-olds. However, risk young people taken lightly, especially given cases post-infection Multi-system Inflammatory Syndrome Children, researchers caution. would guessed twist late fourth season? news possible new stimulus check America? That's ok. need vaccine reduce transmission therapeutic reduce risk. We're track distant future talk statistics constantly sub. Statistics important understanding facts. doesnt make deaths less important. kind attitude bad right ignoring facts isnt want hear. that's concern even small fraction mild asymptomatic cases, see incidence heart lung issues going absolutely roof across country given widespread study suggests minor cases are? understanding issue problem already severe cases, much likely get counted traditional tests. I’m special ed assistant high school drive-by visits students May. happy see parents gotten kids used mask. Including couple sensory autism issues. We’ll see things look like month.

My comment wasn’t going anything. saw “autistic” wanted chime in. person downvoted supreme joke ashamed themselves. Absolute balls. right lot people power do. Economic mitigation, support supply chains, forced manufaturing. yes, mask mandates. SF Jan June. 

People adhering stay-at-home restrictions. policing was, Marin.

The data reflects continued growth cases people started ignoring stay home orders. happy help, receive thousands dollars. free programs available hard get limited number free beds. easy wanting go rehab, wanting extremely important. Nah BLM protests happening suburban Florida, duh! /s Covid deaths preventable temporary lockdowns vaccine. Permanent lockdown prevent flu deaths addition vaccine make much sense. go. wonderered long would take Reddit made leap “if get sick deserved trying hard enough”.

Given reddit feels fat people, saw coming mile away. not. resounding shift policy I’d pleasantly surprised! No, know anything anti bodies either.  dare state fact runs counter anecdotal fear mongering goes love people still act like choice. 

The boost unemployment ends week well PPP supplementing millions Americans pay. Despite numbers, largely insulated economic damages crisis, case going forward additional stimulus passed. 

Money aside, we're talking collapse entire healthcare system. million new cases last 2 weeks continue grow something. reach herd immunity years. There's reason every single country lockdowns...

We going back lockdown, simple. don’t guys test flu? Freedom! treasure freedom America Devil went ~~Georgia~~ Florida missing something, 6x underestimate? Here's snippet calculation, divided number COVID-19 deaths Indiana – 1,099 time – total number people determined cumulatively infected 2.8% population – 188,000.

But 1099 going understimate, people infected time yet died time, right?

What really done taken ratio died random sample far people tested positive?

So unless I'm misunderstanding, 0.6% floor mortality rate (within Indiana early May anyway, ho well generalizes outside state debate).  current inhabitant correct calling fake news years ago. lot journalists need checked learn can't crank whatever myth want. real problem came suggest authorize worthy news source. Soooo....that's people distrust what's told via media. 

I mentioned mate day, ""I watching story CNN..."", immediately dismissed CNN gullible, fake, ""not real news"".  folks listened start mention agree, we'd totally different scenario now. could also mutate something far dangerous. longer let circulate, likely becomes.

Edit- meant response different comment made. fucked posted wrong place. $2 billion=not money maker? Coronavirus existed 2019. totally different tone. Masks best wearing them, things get better they're going get worse first, etc. RT-PCR tests slow, high sensitivity point scaling approach, defunded. need instead low sensitivity antigen tests detect people infectious, get results 10 minutes, cost $1, done home. technology stuck waiting FDA approval scientists incorrectly thought low sensitivity problem (it's actually big plus). Heh, started feeling sick 16/07 though bit understandable took sick leave. don’t know help helps me. perspective people 80 years ago thought world gonna end ww2. people 100 years ago thought may end ww1. didn’t push forward. death rate covid near 1% + - 2%. hospitalization rate less 20%. Overall likely fine. control one person worrying won’t help.  Seek therapist talk psychiatrist prescribe medication. wonderful drugs help balance out. taken needed like propranolol help get anxiety control. Sometimes people get caught feedback loops anxiety makes anxious. Get second opinion someone help break cycle. Look american needing make themselves. Give pat back heres cookie. stfu. banned city month. really flavored vapes highschool kids whatever, go way find dip flavored tobacco. Amazing difference happens nation takes virus seriously nation decides ignore medical experts yolo it. Americans learn WW1 happened school?

The entire Austria sending question ""do backs"" Germany, getting blank letter back, sending impossible demands Serbia, giving 24 hours, Russia wanting show they're tough strong losing Japan. etc. etc. person talking stanford/usc antibody testing. antibody testing determine percentage population come contact disease, relevant question deadliness. 

It pointed tests high false-positives, said also high false-negatives (btw, means tests really bad). give evidence antibody tests Standford/USC studies high false negatives, tell that's didn't./ Decedents: dead people 


descendants: future generations given family Yeah NY estimated 150k day alone. UK estimated 100k+ peak Saying something based best information time lying. wrong lie. New cases stabilizing good start Texas....hope starts go soon. turn, post scientists recently talking surprised outbreaks occur. make up?

Yes, carriers. That’s it’s safer outside reduced capacity.

If closed merch areas, regulated bathrooms, mandated masks distancing walkways, would suddenly ok game? 3M f*cking play. End first quarter. like don’t want bunch faulty shit.    Jail ass extreme exercise, rarely feel like I'm breath mask. can't even remember miracle occurring, take minutes. would anybody go kind trouble? us carrying around poorly secured tracking devices right now. Organizing easier said done need one coworker willing willing strike you. call union organizer teamsters, IWW, etc.. try could well case. think likely immunity keeps safe, still open possibility. 

Maybe less lazy am... standard tests used, false positive negative rates? fearmongering fuckers need get away from. fucking heads living little bubble terror. We're getting point people dying got sick things started explode mid June. August horribly grim. again: noted people long pre-exposure HCQ.

&amp;#x200B;

The claim long pre-exposure ""confering protection acquisition infection"". claim, original one, hardly anybody long pre-exposure HCQ actually dying Covid-19.

&amp;#x200B;

Is really hard, now, actual numbers actual death rate among people long exposed HCQ? wednesdays new tuesdays. think deaths would worse 24 hours ago. I'm 100% masks wear mine even around household members. question. Covid particles small typical cloth covering/surgical mask protect catching it, protects others catching you. possible? they're small enough come mask infect me, would covid particles expelled mouth/nose contained mask? I've seen videos/articles particle spread vs. without mask, assume larger particles/bacteria reduced. I’ll believe see it. Seriously, hope happens. I’m optimistic going done properly. reported 197 new COVID-19 deaths Wednesday, setting record deaths state reported single day.


Highest number I've seen while. assume SARS jr. play rules? Lol want misinterpret that’s one you. potential spelling mistake due auto correct phone ain’t bad misinterpreting entire sentences over. 

Expect aren’t mutually exclusive. could told people wear normal mask saving n95s doctors close proximity patients long periods time need higher levels protection n95 won’t help people anyways cause won’t use correctly. 

The US isn’t listening still giving money one thing. 

Oh dear leader Canada scandal scandal. 

For payments contract allow China put equipment embassy’s worldwide. 

All listening saying nothing Chinese concentration camps. There's need lockdown again. Mandatory masks best way combat without fucking economy causing unemployment.  REFUSAL WEAR MASK LITERALLY OPPOSITE CONSCIENTIOUS. think US bad everybody want come celebrities hate much leave? take 1 million immigrants every year, freedom compared countries. See next year! :D Boy neat Fauci lied country masks, admitted it!

He knows fucked big time respect he’s letting Trump push around, it’s hard trust someone dishonest, regardless whatever good intentions were. esophagus, larynx, trachea, lungs... Yay!  struggle breath mask imagine feel covid I’m not. stay vigilant symptoms though. continue check blood oxygen. Bout fucking time. Neither seems they. enemy leaders... Rise Americans kick made horrible situation leading. positive % rate? heady mix quarantine seeing cancer person, likely caused smoking. Either way, I’m 4 months 1 day now. Since someone invented something ever accurate read would end used?

What earth characterising ""quicker, cheaper reliable"" PCR based tests? Abbott now? allergies. It’s definitely allergies case. Where's Americans drinking gutter oil eating god-knows-what wet markets?

The spread nothing dirty, spread easily pretty much every single country. continuing spread US impossible actually stop something contagious flu country 330 million people spread across vast country freedom ingrained culture. Funny can't stay long words. I’m personally ok that. Give essential workers first. deserve studied extensively 

6 months They’re “ignoring precautions,” they’re taking exact precautions public health officials recommended.

Except aren’t. 6’ apart would ~15% capacity. mind numbers.  focusing good attitude general feeling collective well-being. Nobody said kids hers! got better word doubters ?????? TIL....but can't use Tenga.... would matter time bouncer customer escalates uses excessive force leading potential liability, viral videos, bad press etc. There’s probably even substantial anti-mask customer base they’re losing business even it’s 10% something, businesses want every dollar get days. wear actual respirator work day, I'm overweight smoke. 

No issues mask annoying, stop crying wear mask. know sometimes enter country, border police makes fill form, one questions ""Are terrorist?"". I've always wondered actually answers Yes. Following Donald's logic, actually making sick cuz testing.

Dude must also 3 microchips sinuses now. Fun fact. Cancer 12x deadly flu apparently 2x deadly Covid. Heart disease 13x.   Mine getting better last week gotten worse previous cycles. I’m nearing 120 days, positive antibody test, know wasn’t false positive I’m essential worker worked closely swab test confirmed Covid survivors experienced classic symptoms. thought almost unnoticeable it’s back big way. could regular exercise routine right now. I’m barely scraping days. Statistically probably are. Try worry much it. Oh do, quite few. like infection rate probably ratio 1/100 compared live ;) *this person sure knows hows Texas* USA USA USA #1 Exactly, that's list we're counting worst us royally fucked beyond belief. logical response, thank it’s mask suggestion, speak knowing play system, they’ll probably get way soon. 5 years long enough fall outside window criminality. knows he’s doing. Scum fuck. Trump encourage consistent. Wear MAGA ones sell followers. care. stop idiot. 

His followers anything says .. could rest us favor. Worldometers us 1068 Cali Texas like 102 103 each. 

Either/both could added another 20+ would put us it. Polls Republican Senators facing election.  Ttump potential lose near 50 states unheard of.  He's taking career Republicans him. went rolling shit they're shocked stink. ""I wish well, I've met numerous times years lived Palm Beach.

""Distant roaring""

Sargent Nurse Arms : Enemy AC-130 above! vaccinate workers around elderly. one plan I’ve read Ahhhh one those. makes lot sence now. 

Good luck! That’s frightening... “can cause blindness absorbed skin.”  trolling. He’s still mad said would like flu months. Well half NY already it... That's got illegal. assure American living America (Florida) right surreal people protesting life saving measures. Like wtf?

It's like living Uncle embarrassed never see since always out. gotta live together awhile realize much asshole is. 

Time corrective measures. obese, puts high risk, even young science? LOL. Maybe tell journal published science, universities scientists work science. 

You clearly know scientific method is. Hint: Hypothesizing theorizing huge part. Yeah need pay 10 minutes nurse's time administer shot brief means + supplies doctor's office/pharmacy + time document got shot add medical records.

If insurance free. think states run ads doxxing violators. Mask violators, people throw parties etc. Nope. becomes like flu, every year fucks portion population kills chunk, basically try mitigate best can. entirely possible becomes ""Worse flu flu"" groups bigger, would suck.

The take-away best practical case get vaccine, life shifts back something akin pre-pandemic status, there's one thing list stuff going risk taking cancer does. prove help? Sadly, you’re right r/e reinforcement part. Something Brazil ill afford. again, live country whose President started advocating wearing face masks...yesterday. Trump would probably say Bolsonaro’s soft testing much. Wtf? mom made miss dance teen due flu? It’s small group people: 68 million + Americans 65. Add people comorbidities. 100 million Americans diabetics, 2 million cancer, etc. military get vaccinated well us. average American get vaccine quite time. reality.

Edit: sorry typos I’m working. thought main reason stopped causing pandemics Western developed herd immunity.  think Doctors trolling point? Don’t it. people southern Indiana willing comply this. Hell walk Walmart mask remove soon get in. That's America said 🤣🤣  tested positive around July 8, within 1 week would seen severe symptom any.

Since longer that, probably experiencing milder version disease.

Perhaps he:

- wearing mask exposed, got lower initial viral infection

- may taking HCQ, ivermectin, zinc, vitamin d, vitamin c (anti-oxidant), even NAC (N-acetylcysteine) - individually together may reduce chances severe form (compared zinc vitamin deficiency example).  Huh? Same, thought bad flu February, recently found covid. attributing chronic sore throat fatigue anxiety pandemic stuck inside. I’m scared happens next.

Wear masks. Can't stress enough. FHM (Swedish CDC) tried targeted survey hardest hit area Rinkeby, failed even though talked press conferences much wanted people participate. simply interest population.

Most know done test either shielded ""work-from-home"" crowd, less likely infected average, people curious. clear-cut symptoms already know bothered even though free.

The reduction percent likely due antibodies faded many people now. We're protected T-cells instead. Keep mind even though Sweden highest confirmed amount cases per day June, people actually sick late February early April. get tested time.

Considering disease reduced sharply past month, social distancing staying home completely gone there's one reasonable explanation that's sort built-up immunity Stockholm. 

Doomsday preppers -

The mask edition night went store, walked entrance, couldn’t move pain.

Scariest thing ever, experience.

A broken rib *really* difficult tell apart heart attack.

Suffice say one point life very, happy learn broken rib. right. Birds free. pedantic all. paying albeit indirectly, giving us free even. Dont let become diluted think government giving something free. Someone somewhere paid it. around 4% mortality rate right now, might closer 95%. 95% sizeable population suffer chronic illness afterwards, ranges minor issues fairly severe debilitating. want catch this, even survive wreck havoc cause life long injury.  


So answer question, survive, well cope via feeding tube, lifetime prescription anti-inflammatories, dialysis, myriad ""coping methods."" lucky, avoid long term health issues. cost? many others infect knew disease? people also survive? people infect survive? horrible thing ponder, consequences taking seriously, unless sociopath. assuming government behave logical responsible way. dumb non-smoking ass gone 2-3ish 1wk periods vaping get panic attacks slow down. 

It’s like drink around clock (actually working trying cut back. March June were... rough unhealthy). days chest tight breathe right, barely sleep even though used good sleep habits, I’ve entire weeks pulse never really dips 100 (as mildly athletic, avg weight 20something often sits 60-70 even adderall), either eat like shit don’t eat all, lost ~12lbs muscle, yet doc keeps rushing eDoor saying everyone anxious right now. 

There’s much deep breathing (Which hurts) exercises telling “it’s ok” world falls apart around do. irony palpable Horse. Door. Bolted ""scientists""

🙄🤦‍♀️🤫 Lockdown 2: Electric Boogaloo preppers -  mask edition CDC still lying effectiveness February. Would've great done too. also test still produced, thats why. charged attempted murder. *properly made KN95 masks effective. 

There's lot cheap crap labeled KN95 there. really? Operation Warp Speed? removed comment response political grounds.  essentially ask: would rather say opposite said - horrible orange one wear mask?  Would rather advocated death followers?

Remember, even wish death followers, people wear mask reasons tribal politics still infect people perfectly moral/innocent.  I'm favor getting many people wear mask possible. Weird, go away... OK - prove 100% economists disagree this. America 90 heads-up still bungled response. January, American news making fun Chinese saying poorly they'd handle virus Democracies better.

Well guess what? 6 months pandemic America still responded formal fashion. 6 months Americans still wearing masks staying home. What's worse still? None ya'll able holding accountable. Even blame China instead piss poor leadership shitty individual behavior.  One way worse earlier pandemic, cases much clustered around specific spreading events. E.g., cases concentrated. appear ""spread out"" less clustered, particularly D.C. Instead 1 person infecting 5 people, 5 people infecting \~8 people.

It easier control highly clustered spreading events closing large indoor venues, offices/buildings, etc. much harder control high levels community spread seeing. see progress, would likely return much stricter guidelines.

That one way current trend community transmission worse April. I’ll deny deny reality push headlines don’t even support narrative. 

lol lot stupid choices. Like
Lying usefulness masks. lying statistics helps one. Hmmm... European feel kind like citizen vassal state Ancient Rome.

While Nero setting city fire. doubt unfortunately virus community countries. there's option Democrats besides Republicans. Voting third party completely useless akin throwing ballot trash.  Trump declares martial law maintain power pointing widespread riots civil war.

If Trump denies results election civil war.

The way see us civil war provide real relief people Trump voted out, [which look buy gun, civil war probably inevitable. Try different fingers too. One thin silver linings miserable pandemic. Disease goes down, favourability goes up. store started enforcing mask rule Monday since sure going yet. Luckily armed security now, since riots (Minneapolis) get enforce instead poor lowly employee.  Oh god. sufferer Ulcerative Colitis, know fatigue brain fog well. wish best. also hope condition doesn’t help Covid affect me.  continue? Yesss. Seasons 1-10 gospel home. 11-13 diamonds rough pretty much became different show gave up. god Karens! Trump? Yes, American houses tend bigger European -and people know bathrooms/toilets one, even families four. also bought millions doses Resdemsivir. Ah yea, Bolsonaro Hitler II .. comment responding **more** influenza testing number cases dramatically,

So one wrong here. Sounds like work medicine, I'm guessing you? hope isn’t case give doses every months would totally different ballpark Wow would thought that?!
/s Talking disinfectant sounds like talking different disease, surface contact disease usually spreading

They could talking disinfecting inside like trump suggested. 🤯 Latest speculation: closest thing sure-fire prophylactic. I've curbside pickup Sprouts Instacart. fee like $2 think reasonable compared delivery. However, sometimes feel guilty curbside pickup sure why.

But! great service thankful it. allow protect household, also protecting others going store. werent protesting. virus pro protest spread then. own. like seasons, activities them. Lived south couldn’t deal heat. Cali weather definitely peachy though.

I certainly generalizing. makes sense tons workers move industries. Like really debated SWE opportunity college, couldn’t justify COL difference. people making mistake move without industry scales compensation. anything end big payday executives?

Not bankruptcy

Not fraud

Not lying massively addictive opioids... misunderstanding comment. Viruses mutate become less deadly. almost always become less deadly. That's point.

This virus could mutate slightly deadly (but appears mutated slightly less), change I'm saying. second wave 1918 pandemic due deadly version flu. People getting reinfected - new people were, unlucky enough become infected lethal version.

If I'm infected Covid tomorrow real rough go stay bed couple weeks go hospital, body produce antibodies defend virus. body hold onto antibodies time. know long yet, appears vary based severity. antibodies disappear probably become reinfected, body forget make antibodies though. infected something similar again, quickly remake needs fight virus. second time get it, maybe I'll cold asymptomatic.

How quickly happen kind depends long body holds onto antibodies for. Even Covid became deadly, body still roadmap beat it, unlikely subsequent infections would severe first, UNLESS exogenous change health.

The virus continues normal virus stuff eventually long run become less deadly, mutations reduce lethality encourage infectiousness encouraged virus survival. note time H1N1 longer like 3% deadly. added new categories spreadsheet State Negatives, State Positives, Total DoH Tested, State Posivite%, Minus Dipulates Positive (from Total State Testing), Totals Testing without Positive Duplicates, Positive % without Dipulates Positive. Since people confused agreeing metrics I'm using. According subtract duplicates positive state would counts negative duplicates data people confused since state count negatives new. Like today 98,166 Negatives duplicates positive rate 9.97%. NY here. Med staff heroes. Cherish them. guys know need? governor. Seriously government thinking? 

What makes think government engages many people call ambulance

True. I've made decision before. drunk driver hit me, glad conscious able request take ambulance hospital. 81 highest since April 20. alarming. Georgia lucky Florida next door one talks Desperation mother re-invention.  submitted ticket PubMed's helpdesk see take down. Pretty sure prank. brand new technology. thinking AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine. People still visit VN. However, that's making assumption that's reason contained. measures precautions place.

Like I've said earlier, authoritarianism works contain this. something people UK, USA etc want. empirical data regarding main protest cities? hopefully one love, even capable that, dies it. Grief never goes away, becomes sad, permanent part you. havent boughten firearm extra cash ill prepared anarchy next 6 months. Sars go away killed people quickly staying power? truly cannot repeat \*cannot\* use logic rational thinking extremists. proven here. could say, ""I love puppies kitties"" people like would go ""ummm basically saying HATE cats wish could die???"" gonna go anywhere. world black white, extremist, is. all. I'm vaccines, long they've properly tested. pushups go jog. don’t need gym workout. reckless source spreading. rock wall home coincidence. happens one day Trump officially changes message mask usage. means governors allowed people home states die simply want right thing issue order president would against.

It's sort like pundits like declare U.S. Post Office liability rule pensions funded 75 years future.

So, California big rainy day fund budget surplus, pundits still shout ""Bankrupt!"" over. indication SARS-CoV-2 going end like human coronaviruses. They're entirely different species virus likely millions years evolution isolation other. Prime /r/LeopardsAteMyFace/ given tons, dismiss since already made mind. way enlighten someone sure correct dumb realize stupid are. 

April bad NYC. bad ton places. Future spread way worse latter. April peak. not.  sound excited asshole science 

🤣 also need consider probably enough data yet make determination. virus runs population center things calm due precautions taken seriously, lockdowns, anti-bodies, etc combination many factors. We'd need see resurgence one large metro areas like New York City months downtime could potentially compile dataset indicating one way another. hurts back smoke so, easy quit. coronavirus type virus. stuff people call Common Cold, caused coronavirus. happens Covid-19 specially nasty type coronavirus. Lots different viruses cause runny noses, sneezes, coughs lump together 'having cold'. things coronaviruses. long salt rock lamps well, good dunno. due respect Tonya, I'm sure take expert.

It says admitted ""to emergency room"" . OK, went emergency room felt like shit. Got it. say admitted hospital ICU. doctors deem necessary. says ""nearly died"". Probably felt like it, expert opinion. 

So recovered. exactly teacher schools re-open. risk zero. said believe safety protocol would safe enough schools reopen. 

What teach? That's pretty sweeping statement. listening opinion expert disease? quoted pretty sensational headline?

I'm prepared downvotes. I'd prefer discussion points wrong. [A rare audio recording territorial FloridaMan Paging President Madagascar It’s one size fits all. Every measure population takes reduce transmission capital spend activities increase transmission.

If area lot mask wearing, social distancing, etc., maybe opening indoor dining brought R 0.7 0.95 cases still fell. Maybe another area less mask wearing R went 0.8 1.05 cases rise. advocating permanent lockdown flu? Thanks lot!! too. cure yellow flavor I'll take Covid  “We’re turning thing back good direction.” think they'll put significant effort stave hospital collapse, pretty much that. cant lower R0... R0 based ""no actions beeing taken"". R rate one changes fingers crossed *(not friend)* still dies it

edit: yes, particular asshole that's feel.

brazil 80k+ deaths 7 (couple weeks ago 15) times less testing US. Bolsonaro responsible give fuck whether piece shit lives dies, preferably latter CA's population also twice large NY's. still much lower per capita basis. things defiantly trending we'll see. argue want ask defense attorney it’s smart lol....

You don’t want look like getting arrested great experience. can’t get ‘god’s beautiful breathing machine’ woman brain.

I genuinely can't imagine close minded judgmental. Part feels sorry brain even works way. Let us go ahead safely assume made bad decisions yourself, therefore flawed logic close-minded rationale, must also selfish asshole. Must difficult seeing world judgmental ""this that"" extremist lens. lockdown skeptics think they're gonna look smart ""blows over"" annoys people wear masks, low like chin nose pretty much useless! someone ELI5 virus persists indefinitely like that?

Anyone option keep kids home still send kids danger terrible parent front end, they're basing development prior work Sars, mers, viruses... cuts big chunk development.

3 years terribly wrong guess phased trials, cut good chunk time overlapping phase 1 2. phases test: hurt people, illicit right response body (and dose).

Now phase body response actually confer immunity (plus expanded safety larger population). Corona virus infectious prevalent, likely see pretty significant data early control group test group. would suspect would see control group enough cases within 3 months, tell whether treatment group faring better.

For trial might take much longer, take something like chicken pox. treat test subjects, hope get exposed see body response effective. bunch kids vaccinated 6 mean would exposed short period time; might take years look control test groups see significant, meaningful, data. 

The interesting thing see data overwhelmingly positive treatment effective, becomes unethical allow control group access drug. happened truly effective vaccine, surprised see occur.

omg figure 6. train wreck. 

probability: 0, 0/2,0/4,0/6,0/8,1, 1/2.

so get right vertical axis labeled 0,0,0,0,0,1,0.5

OMG chart even dumber thought.
as wavelength hits visible radiation chance mutations 100%. basically exposed light start mutating war peace, freedom slavery, ignorance strength.  Seem fit US bit much. US government ordered 300 million Oxford vaccines? never heard this, doubting that’s good hear. 

So AstraZeneca vaccine “back up” sorts? Like extra supply? Well then, virus feel right home Bolsonato's head, heart. popsicle? Popsicles usually give time relax brain minute, helps find solution problem. Please link proper professional critique, personal opinion without proper referencing. Guess ill one lucky ones make 99.9% world survives. ever cope? Well yeah, people plans...so hit grocery mask free. Quick. Get toilet paper. Haha jump conclusions mat. love movie! Every country society people acting irresponsibly. problem many reasonable rest it. 

The problem ain't Americans bad stupid people. problem lot people acting irresponsibly part media acting like 19th century snake-oil salesman since decades time many people fell it.

Btw actually really enjoy among Americans. Good thing wherever go travel could find Americans. hope come back again, seems best idea. idiot looting Scottsdale fashion square ? issue also makes alot worse aswell. Ta butt guys fucking arrogant, also bad reading comprehension problems.  fact remains accepted published prestigious journal, still science 

no. editorial. science. better ad placed viagra journal. conclusions drawn pure fantasy, actual research testing.

edit: figures hilarious start finish. Fig. 6 trainwreck neither axis right. take face value exposed light immediately start mutating. ordinary visible light 100% chance mutation.

dermatological antenna. lol. whats ground plane? wait gotta check dielectric constant dead skin cells gonna hilarious.

hehe, skin depth decreases frequency increases, paper backwards...waves less likely able get DNA hit mmW likely. absolute opposite shown one figure. still can't understand DNA act antenna. wanted know absurdity comment made bust laughing. Newsom ordered second shut non-essential businesses many CA counties (those higher numbers) say going well would understatement. can't imagine tried roll nationwide lockdown without providing financial assistance. People would lose it. Another? Like U.S. fucking one begin with! government know know whole charade virus? positive 54,961 tests

These new tests, new individuals tested. account people tested multiple times, including them, Florida 102,190 tests. somehow people believe they're plateauing stagnant testing. can’t. like probably aren’t going turn someone who’s racist, opposite side political spectrum, anyone believes something strongly. Doesn’t matter wrong ridiculous are. best bet distance people, mentally literally. Oh good, Pennsyltuckians again. hal·le·lu·jah  hal·le·lu·jah

Some people need learn hard way 🤷🏼‍♀️ vaccinated measles, very, difficult catch measles. vaccinated, exposed someone else it, almost impossible catch it.

MMR vaccine one one guy claimed caused autism, that's cases measles US, people believed baked study instead dozens studies since support claims. Even fucking lunatic recommending it. 3 10 positive false positive. also 18 90 negatives false.

How tell which? think that's concern. people think safe wandering workplaces grocery stores, wherever.

Edit: meant criticism anyone, interesting question me. Well per week tho right?

Just want note understand lowering covid bonus $600 per week. point would make unemployment+bonus it’s long term there’s point many Americans work all. I’d quit. People need taken care don’t think need make middle class people exceed way normal living pandemic state countries finances. makes sense means necessary

*The CIA entered chat.* I'm avoiding Facebook Twitter. makes go rants get super stressed. One trip store county that's mandated wear masks tells need know. put one keep nose. 

It's going mess soon schools opening requiring masks. want die. Protests may lead spread. led spikes though, right? spikes places big spikes are.

It lot hard spread outdoors wearing mask bar gym aerosols work.

Any public activity easily end leading increases, conflate spikes become public health emergencies. 'uptick' different 'spike' 'no effect' far broad term use here.

What talking much increases explained protests much explained indoor gatherings like churches, bars, gyms, restaurants.  spit even get car? I've run plenty crazy people never called cops. Cost living varies widely state state. house costs $200k Texas easily cost $1 million + West Coast. 10 day period. Thanks. people wearing masks public California (at least am, can't speak areas like Huntingdon Beach, seen contain lot idiots).

Unfortunately, still people refuse believe, want 'inconvenience' wearing mask. also people slyly bypassing state mandate mask wearing. saw multiple people go grocery store day masks on, soon got (and past employee checking door) pulled down. Sadly, people cannot persuaded reason compassion.

Good luck city. Stay strong too. :) lockdowns caused anger divisiveness

Had focused masks social distancing start would much better shape trying half assed “ lockdown” Maybe much Alabama, NY SF enough Conservatism. wasnt meant literal thing... jesus take reading comp school? heard one time seem much follow up. least LA County say recent measures showing impact. announced recent R calculations slightly 1 right above. much relief they've said modeling predicts 10% less ICU usage earlier pandemic due advanced intervention therapeutics. expect run hospital beds even surge. staffing issue point. Trump absolutely right testing. California south seeing increase now. almost every state handful exceptions, even states stricter policies.

I think even helpful compare April, sake argument, still insist type community spread worse. resistant policy, depend individuals right thing. Absolutely us, there's decent chunk people taking seriously unfortunately still outweighed dummies still throwing parties BBQs could take quarantine even week. Well many people COVID similar reactions worse ones. don’t often wish pain loser symptoms kick ass. Sometimes medication better baby rampant, untreated anxiety...... Heres Indiana's latest case/death charts, running 7-day actually pretty well compared states. Death curve way down, although cases definitely spiking again. I'm area, seems overall pretty good, May 31 198 people hospital, 55 now, steadily going deaths. Actually numbers Monroe County, think largest Finger Lakes region. hogwash.
The truth infection ravaging population control numbers. Atleast dont live shithole country chooses death fabric mask.

You still pass comment get here. homework commenting next time. I'd say Jesus Christ, man oversimplify generalize way doing.    

I guess logic enslaving people stealing spice trade routes, since that's ancestors nutshell. Who’s gonna enforce don’t? gives guy statistics?! said death rate down... Compared when?! 50% since beginning July.

I have, instance, expensive, top-of-the-line coverage family Australia. hybrid system - everyone covered Medicare (3.5 k per annum taxes, free pay private health, do), 30% Australians (like me) elect private cover. Public hospitals better comprehensive services one centralised location, private hospitals quieter better food.

I’ve cancer three years now, husband daughter bipolar, son plays lot sport gets regular physiotherapy keep injury zone. us hospital stay (in case, weekly) last 12 months. pay $7500 USD per *year* whole family complete coverage, includes dentistry, opthamology, physiotherapy, gym membership, nutritionists, psychiatry, psychology, coverage expensive medicines, garments mastectomy recovery, ambulance hospital care surgery. lot people camping line close get ticket it’s capped 50%. blogspot.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* ya ain't first, last ;) paper dogshit. Counting test positive ct ~~3.6~~ 67 irresponsible. That’s even background. truly awful, way saying tragedy, parents pre-existing conditions? horrible stories read said something person condition begin with. Oh wow free?! I'm honestly impressed pharma overlords allowed Thanks that. definitely much less substantial remembering. Hopefully someone decided go make sure texts describe actually happening disgruntled employees. give reputable source wrong colossal waste time say anything nonsense. 

Also missing something? advanced people think are? Tracking devices? Administered vaccine? Like teeny tiny needle? small cant see vial? Bill Gates figure that, deserves able track us. Unfortunately, matter many times data shows deadly flu need take seriously, bunch folks keep saying overhyped take seriously... Sounds like someone wants use coronavirus vaccines implant tracking devices would say. Illuminati confirmed virus allows limited immunity reinfections documented already. teachers risk “zero”. Population density likely Cause one actually closed -_- point people put much stock effective testing, testing good justify excuse risky behaviors. hell matter country? serial killer set hydrogen bomb major city every 80 seconds, would kill 394,000 people per minute! People latching onto ""outdoors bad"" argument attempt normalize daily habits. someone ELI5 virus persists indefinitely like that?

Because can't get **everyone world** stay house two weeks consecutively simultaneously. Things like wearing masks settled science proven time time again. saying data incomplete like means everything somehow severe expected. Could opposite true? could far severe issues (especially long term ones) aware of. beat 3 seconds almost exact quote word word.  that, 20 old samples. counted positive background levels fluorescence. It’s terrible paper. SARS MERS still exist? Curious anyone found anyone who's covid perfectly okay it? Seems another point contention, whether bad everyone says is?

My takeaway every video post people who've bad. Oh know three people who've died there's that.   might be.. it, feel difference. body never issues anything accept tree pollen days. checked webpage found anything. information protocol established March news May June 2th, related flights all. much Facebook neither. You’re one mistaken. CDC reports 0.1% symptomatic IFR influenza, actual IFR.

The real answer don’t know, although estimates &lt;0.03% (at least 75% influenza cases asymptomatic). Influenza isn’t one virus, isn’t going single number. reliable source suggested closing businesses limiting others would make infections disappear two weeks? ""At least 300,000 still stranded aboard ships, according estimate International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF), global network affiliated trade unions representing transportation employees.

In June, ITF petitioned governments loosen restrictions seafarers, citing labor rights noting roughly 300,000 additional workers kept boarding ships—a byproduct restrictions prevent crews disembarking—are facing economic consequences well. union federation refers global crew change crisis.

""Governments must wake realize without return successful crew changes, simply sustainable acceptable growing number tired fatigued seafarers trapped working aboard world's ships, endangering themselves, vessels maritime environment,"" said Stephen Cotton, ITF's general secretary, July 15 statement."" numbers we're dealing estimates. feds lot that. CDC even regulations allowing detain individuals attempting travel possibly infectious pandemic.

Be suspicious anybody tells federal government helpless blameless - neither. feelings important people's lives. That's I'm hearing right now. get little mailer last Spring? metrics lockdown stricter many states. ignored power. constitutional republic. federal government much power lock states EU lock countries. Even states can't lock constitutionally, disrupt interstate commerce prohibited doing. Scholars debating last Spring consensus. India problem first months there's little travel going China, Italy, Iran, South Korea India.

India reacted quickly ran money, lockdowns end can't anymore. would much effective let run course months, lockdown got bad.

but hindsight 20/20. That's exactly someone wants use vaccines implant trackers would say /s That's exactly someone wants use coronavirus vaccine implant tracking devices would say!!! 

/s involves clumsy parents, newborn trump flight stairs Lol isn’t never replied comment. replied later one subject hand wanted discuss. 

lol made assumption wrong. rising deaths. 

Ahh yes control charge single vote.

God damn man feel bad you. education system really failed you. currently global shortage pcr testing supplies. impacting hospital I'm in, even [Albuquerque, NM three major hospital systems stop testing asymptomatic patients. They're likely trying ration supplies.   like flu kills X

650,000 people year. big deal 🙄 guys warned this.... ignorant Americans. nothing gained can’t fearmonger like top comment always saying ""well, death rate low, without mentioning even die, suffer physically, mentally, financially Education, reflection growth powerful tools. appreciate open feedback. Seriously, PA cases going up. Months isolated (I live alone, family thousands miles), going needed, wearing mask. \*ahem\* wonderful folks going fark up. I'm sure they're folks go nice beach vacation packed indoor dining beaches south, come back go three different parties spread around. suffered nearly badly Spain Italy we're unlikely to. enough hospital beds ventilators spare. 
Cuomo threatened sue feds quarantined NY, Trump backed off- spreading COVID East Coast. methods are, say least, dodgy. Fingers crossed trend continues - graphs show active cases seem rise again. Hopefully, turns temporary bump. believe China fault way happened entire world. 

Stop US centric racist, bigot. exactly think common cold most? 12 year old 90 year old? 

Or speculation anyone who's coronavirus(common cold coronavirus, I'm assuming know that), amount protection C19?

Neither makes sense. Everyone common cold. Everyone would form resistance case. Old people anyone, they've alive longer. Clearly protections. cases ever five days ago, NY ever day way. plateau? stats always peaks valleys, trend inarguably up. parr’s dataset ignoring?

I hope end less deaths, can’t blame deaths leadership cases. said promising treatments used, NY early curve didn’t know do. Hell, even trump claimed wall built state helped keep covid said same.

Edit: FWIW I’m registered independent. predict strains prevalent season make vaccines it. They're always right. new strain also come time, they're set calendar. don’t see business would need tell customers personal information employees. People work restaurants get sick time always never warned dining. think responsibility deep cleaning sure employees customers safe.

PS, sorry comes across rude, intention quite opposite, assure you. voiced personal opinion matter  Holy shit-balls, source? offices thousands people don’t simultaneously jump up, charge hall, go different rooms, sit different desk every hour so, like high school. less people people tend cover especially bitterly cold.

if southern states, yeah, guess y'all still screwed. That’s problem. problem many states abide reopening phases didn’t lay guidelines communities. live Florida, local bars restaurants laughed capacity dining-in rules went straight wide open. Nobody stopped them. Well question, mean virus ""run course""? mutate become less serious somehow? significant % population adapt? Well, looks like world wants strong second wave instead second lockdown then... ""I likker, Randy."" Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

Everything countless stories people sending blank PCR tests president African nation testing mangos coming back positive. Literally countless stories stuff happening. PCR tests never meant mass produced mass testing. man invented said so. watched entire conference Nobel Laureate scientists discuss PCR tests THREE HOURS. I'm pretty firm stand PCR tests. I've outspoken since start continue so. Thank goodness, maybe people work start wearing them. studies going back early 1900s least, behalf industries utilize masks mandatory shift-long capacity.

What part ""pandemic"" people understand? open season things before, little fewer people. goddamn highly contagious disease kill. convenient, decide ignore precautions guess. Hot take that’s gonna go well here.

The problem people think can’t wear mask (not talking people *wont*) this:

Lack mental health awareness, treatment options, care.

Sometimes mask can’t breathe. can’t catch breath. sweat even get light headed. It’s worse kn95 thick covering 10x worse I’m wearing bunny suit time. *Because dumbass brain decides panic attack*. decade therapy awareness acceptance know is. tell “this ok”, suck accept I’m gonna feel like shit.

A lot people probably experiencing thing don’t know won’t admit is. Hardly surprise America anyone else, given woeful healthcare self care standards.

They’re sick. kind Reddit cares Cured, kicked hospital due overflow that's concern even small fraction mild asymptomatic cases, see incidence heart lung issues going absolutely roof across country given widespread study suggests minor cases are?

The thing overall death rates going roof. COVID-19 point death rates spiked like last six months we'd frantic search cause. talking about? Far right politicians like Jacob Rees Mogg, Matteo Salvini, Geert Wilders, entire AfD party hell lot right wing left wing US politicians. Plus need longer two weeks two reasons. One, group locked together, anyone yet infected first get infected stop shedding virus. brings number two. period person remains infectious longer two weeks. folks repeatedly tested kept coming positive. still shedding virus, safe release them.

You responded false-positive rate tests high. asked evidence, gave link antibody tests general, asking for. 

And btw, even give evidence antibody tests, tests general. link says coronavirus testing (not antibody, btw, current infection!) problem done early.

Text article read NY nursing homes hugely hit, lots deaths there. I'm sure percentage nursing home deaths compares NY CA, know NY really bad.  can't see site, one showed jump 85 active cases July 15th almost double latest reported day (21th). No. believe aspire 'rona Regal one day. Well interesting watch. “lesser” two evils. It’s disgusting. idea fun name county.  real tragedy die Covid, die scared, helpless, alone. believe read somewhere smallpox victims buried permafrost that's thawing may pose risk letting genie bottle again, I'm positive that... would throw owner out. 

She one saying ok wear mask. condoning actions, choices have? already lived roommate 14 people....where would go given already cramped living conditions tell them, would want out...she place go either way. tell job, would sent home, little sick pay ability claim unemployment. think horrible happened, demonization person extreme without little evidence done maliciously. :) live NY. Yes, way better. Look curve. 

And wasn’t talking leadership, talking average citizen. It’s left fighting wear masks. 

In regards leadership, show democratic leader pushing schools open matter what. know Texas closed bars lowered restaurant capacity back 50% end June. Texas also issued mask requirements early July. Perhaps helping. see. Can't speak Florida Arizona. report 3% Missouri antibodies.

I understand confusing, though. turns out, samples April 20-26. So, compare whatever case count back then.

Just eyeballing charts, would guess MO 7,000 recorded cases May 1, math would check pretty closely then. 24 times would 2.7% population.

It's true modern capitalism give us vaccine, modern capitalism also part reason country's response pandemic first place fucked up.

[What stimulus Winter... think 1 365 pervasive. stronger argument 1 13, imo. 

I think predominant good phrase either. think statement like ""Black americans predominantly curly hair"" fits better ""Black americans predominantly SCT"". this, mean ask former question Black americans, would get near 100% true latter 7%, something would call main characteristic.

Nevertheless, think could factor 0.27% people SCD, can't explain deaths medical complications SCD, like myself, carriers, like myself, SCD/SCT.

And even though personal treatment anecdotal, statistics backs Black americans go medical system, *even control wealth/income*. pretty obvious - shipment MAGA masks (made China, doubt) must finally arrived. Even Pokemon playing redditor man child posting pwecious iron man toy got damaged know well known Chinese steal intellectual property.

Shame publicly. life worth boss's next bonus. Good luck, keep safe. one else going you. fever redness injection site bad vaccine. Deaths significantly lag cases. 

That said, deaths going places big spikes cases. article yesterday saying 40% texas deaths COVID last 2 weeks, example. Yet somehow Detroit hollowed despite much worse poverty.

The reason land prices high people refuse move out. There's collective crab-bucket delusion going people tell impossible leave.

If people decide they'll live 17 people 6 bedroom house, prices rise tolerate that. It’s Trump way. say whatever stupid shit ego centric instinct tells you. Realize it’s stupid shit. Pretend like didn’t stupid shit.

I think making society-wise preparations possible, either. Also politicized. Yeah people need read story. many assuming anti maskers causing issue allowing wear masks issue. 

The people bothered ones requesting actually obey rules supposed follow. 

In air conditioned environment like grocery store air recirculated think wise say ""stay 10 feet away see someone wearing mask"".

I mean person breathing items shelves, know picking walked breathed on?

If sneeze cough stuff store way address that? would guess not. fear teachers across country back session fall. There’s telling students anti-masker/Facebook scientists parents home... parents need go work direly they’re willing risk health children everyone kids come contact with.

Beyond this, classrooms scheduled far less strict cleaning expectation hair salon (classrooms get cleaned classes). districts aren’t providing PPE staff students. 33% teacher population country considered at-risk group (most age).

I understand though “parents need work” ultimately school first “free daycare” push comes shove lot households, really, much going demand teachers? Literally going ask risk dying take care kid hope you’re responsible parents time?

I paid attention June 28 reported China tested set crew arrived Tinjiang (as tested arrival) found 10 sea crew positive boarded ship HK. 

Since than, HK still give exemption crew come required test. airlines cancel flights (AA, UA KL, EK). found like around 5 crews per days testing positive every day coming HK previously exempted (and still free move around HK, fact, one air crew US went restaurant awaiting test result) think seeding covid19 here.

Under bush let's forget million dead brown ppl many women n children. Depleted uranium shells. Bombing powdered milk businesses. Date farms. Food warehousing. Water purification plants. Bridges.

Unclean water troops.
Stolden billions missing aid money. Insurance fraud.
Bush n trump n Obama cousins British Royal families.

You're living media generated world real life.
In real life enemy state. stupid dangerous. easy turn good. gave easy. hard others.
Love u. Good right thing. I’ve full time associate five different stores across three states (Fl GA SC) helped countless others. really close friends still work hope stores. Management gets paid really really well rightfully held higher standard let’s say Winn Dixie manager. Unfortunately times head far stuck ass worrying BMW payment $350k house payment make bad decisions impact others uplift upper management doesn’t see what’s really going store. one higher climb ass kiss got out. Yes, Brazil's hospitals positivity rate stays same, 10 percent, wishful thinking. Apparently quite backlog tests. ‘MURICA Nope. didn’t “disagree” anything. You’re willingly downplaying seriousness pandemic. Thanks people like US still suffering. Africa probably won’t get better August. That’s you’re piece shit [hospitalizations (click Hospital COVID-like &amp; influenza-like Illness Surveillance) supposed lagging indicator. Click ""Hospital Bed Usage &amp; Availability"" see beds peaked 7/16. I'm crossing fingers AZ. legit. It’s CDC running 2 randomized tests 10 different locations across country. isn’t much argue here. give valuable confidence ranges well. point is, antibodies present many many people reported. mostly good thing guys. Let’s assume deaths nearly accurate (give take margin error- deaths tend underreported factor 10x) cases underreported 1000% means dealing much contagious less severe infection/illness many people, meaning heard immunity may possible sooner vaccination. They’re iOS’ normal emoji panel, lightbulb midway through.  😧 is. published results Monday. It’s going hot mess way slice it. criminally charged. numbers see actually quite old. Also, better reporting. really tend spend much time adults (voters) uninformed. Read Hague cases, ask statistics, ask commission torture read reports made lifetime, look business elite country uses slave labour laws country makes impossible, perhaps think little danish health ministry journalists often refer information given CCP, trustworthy.


Denmark cases human rights violations children Hague, Denmark tend back anytime Hague takes case Denmark. countries back automatically Hague declares case human right violation children, Denmark tries explain away violation. 

It common knowledge danish court system, **defence** lawyers tries get client normal prison, **prosecutor** seeks imprisonment mental wards. Denmark twenty years reports eu commission torture, declaring torture mental wards endemic. politicians countless times declared **political stop torture** Denmark ... continued fail. that, thoroughly investigated continues. politicians kept shifting blame hospital staffs hospital staffs kept shifting blame back adult voters remain uninterested news it, years later conclusion danish people archaic attitude mental illness, shared layers society. **Political torture** last established danish healthcare reform attempt (that tried lock mentally ill less space required normal prison inmate). read many reports torture commissions, would surely understand seriousness political torture. 

The question remains, voters democracy issue supporting CCP. Well hit 1000 yesterday. right. current insanity growth many states driven retransmission rate around 1.2-1.4 -- meaning person gets it, give little one person each.

Now imagine bad would retransmission rate 16.0? That's measles level infection there. head sand. made situation worse downplaying it, big time. Also better hope get sick twice. Pay-walled article.  good bot covidly states US still 1k death per day.. enjoy population decrease guess Thank xD make political let narcissistic man-child play king conspiracy propagandist. systemic government. oligarchical foothold rich. lobby government, government spins everything appeal masses brainwashes them. Look prison system see evolved. get reigns power back general populace, we're fucked. Prison? shouldn’t be. citizens. guests. I'm sure implying I'm Trumpet. haven’t seen figures timeline Germany can’t speak it’s spread started implementing restrictions. Countries like Belgium UK clearly show even relatively sharp lockdowns, community spread advanced far enough implement you’re going see lot serious cases. Germany seems timely response most. Keep mind, flu. Like miracle, go away. We're seeing many cases we're testing anyone. Masks anything. great vaccine going soon. liberal media overblowing hurt Republicans. bar stay crowded even everyone hates crowded is? long line outside fill people desperate get in, whatever reason, even complain crowded bar is.

It's ""sustainable"" people start assumption ""I *have* live here,"" whatever reason, convolute lives crazy ways make happen. keeps prices going up.

People need stop thinking ""buying something whining really loudly price"" going bring prices down. Prices come people decide much pay stop paying it.

But everyone wants *someone else* stop paying go away. are. college educated American technical white collar job would probably fine anywhere really.

The fact written seriously, hypothetical reality may face striken absurdity.

So, basically SARS-2 fails fronts thus always us. surprise anyone. Hahaha! People can't figure Canada made department it? Good God! stupid humans? Facepalm. read article? That’s exactly saying Well from. CA also running lot tests actually now. Testing NY extremely limited hit peak. one people almost symptoms. Two months later still barely get bed keep food down. baptist subset protestant. Oh ok I’d always heard Adhd linked working memory. page also says working memory correlated IQ, someone low working memory still fairly intelligent Thanks, first I've heard that.   Correct i’m wrong, viruses, although « alive », still classified microbes along bacteria fungi. Microbes small organisms. think you’re thinking antibiotics, would effect virus. I've started paying attention curve weeks ago. get really bad, especially since testing per capita horrible.

I'm sure data going accurately reflected, deaths marked something else. death case ratio, testing per 100k already absurd. Thanks, glad hear it. Happy like 250 million shy lol Yeah. Post hoc justification. like guy. Let confabulate reasons why. hydrochloroqine working Calm fuck down? You’re actually kidding, right? 

Stay home. Give income. Stop going out. don’t NEED go shopping grocery store. There’s curbside pickup. don’t NEED go retailer. There’s online shopping. 

You live without income year, STOP going work. It’s dangerous you’re putting others risk every time step outside home.

If don’t like I’m saying, sincerely question insist putting lives others risk WANT walk store go work easily stay inside house year everything delivered door. need willing sacrifice us, otherwise evil, selfish science denier. Please explain detail, exactly personally spreading anything.

I predict dont even reply back. Go troll someone else. Thanks explanation, curious asymptomatic ratio changed domestic cases. anything drive coronavirus evolution would measures China installed, evidence new strain emerged largely cause asymptomatic infections may worth investigating useful agent deliberate exposure research. Yet governors like Gretchen Whitmer made decisions like, threw absolute fit. Remember Prime Minister UK nearly FUCKING DIED Covid-19 first *detected* outbreak Life Care Center Redmond, yes. start there, idea brought facility. also know even first Covid19 death US soil. 

It start nursing facilitiy, was, DNA sequencing, third chain transmission lineage virus. Nursing homes first place virus getting to, visible. symptom. Now, want speculate increased vigilance Nursing Homes led lower risk facilities, thus less deaths, would logical conclusion make. problem. friends think masks anything, cause health problems worn long time. sent know say these, smart enough prove wrong. also saying lot studies dangers masks suppressed... sounds like crazy conspiracy me. someone intelligence tell there's anything studies, masks actually dangerous? apologise bad grammar , English first language. point still stands taking bad grammar excuse come argument means even one. pathetic. *he wants charter schools open impunity. mean pay debt. percentage people getting good thing? place 100,000 people 25,000 get antibodies. reduce spread 25,000 able contract spread 75,000? Exactly New York testing 20,000 near peak close 40% positive rates. California testing 100,000/day awhile. bad incentive, honestly.

There people would want discount. lol I’m pretty sure (Doctor wanted get test unsure difficult get test time sick, symptoms) best thing lay stomach. sick almost six weeks taking 4 different cough medicines, 3 different asthma medications, allergy medicine, nasal steroid crap ton vitamins.


If lips start turning blue start pain sternum go ER immediately! hahah foreal  comment made laugh, also got sort uncomfortable. god, say “I love pineapple pizza“ checking store really think would mentally distance saying it, probably saying heavy sarcastic tone. that’s ridiculous haven’t even thoughT pineapple pizza maybe 2 minutes total life, ever eaten pineapple pizza. right, wouldn’t set store fire, I’d probably find another store. I’d sure seek people like wanted talk stupid say loved pineapple pizza we’d get worked it. what?  Nothing meaningful.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* It’s late. There’s pretty much chance coming back without miracle. needs fix economy end virus Nov. ain’t gonna happen. He’s far behind chance. context every presidential candidate history least one poll showing within margin error opponent. Trump not. He’s average 8 points behind nationally he’s losing almost every swing state. also Georgia! He’s done. Go vote 🗳 What's next step? really need financial help? governer give them, borrow increase tax locally next year? I'm board you. think thing makes freaked want be, actually get Flu COVID time. Ugh. know nobody ever successfully made coronavirus vaccine.  Trump say would give chance re-elected. 
Trump doesn't""t give shit anyone else Trump lie cheat power get attention possible vote. 
Few days ago mislead part population wear masks, today changes narrative knows ""Look"" better way, possibly get votes appearing Smart. watch, mask pocket wears front camera, everywhere else gives crap it. another Trump Lie  whole medical exemptions thing largely hoax circulating anti maskers try bypass regulations. 

Yeah basically advocating ""let's reasonable find acceptable middle ground"" problem masks middle ground. 

The extreme full isolation. 

She basically taking good faith middle ground accepting one starting point negotiation. That’s me.

Spent 4 months home apart errands. Last week decided go see parents another city believe country virus contained. Big mistake.

3 days returning, went dinner bedridden within 30 minutes. like flipped switch. Whole body hurts, joints, severe headaches, fever, dizziness confusion.

Luckily wife ICU nurse shift night call home genuinely thought gonna die. brought Paracetamol administered IV. removed symptoms well enough next morning go get tested returned positive. since lingering symptoms it’s attack immune system got rid virus within 2 days. difficulty smelling tasting think it’s another flu caught hospital. 


The way would describe symptoms take regular cold multiply 50. 

Another thing noticed lack focus loss short term memory. would phone doctor discussing treatment soon hung wife asks said, would staring confused unable tell doctor told 20 seconds ago. It’s never made call. Seriously. there's big group people together middle 2 close - bunch people going care much? I’m talking Southern California, bigger spike think company going global roll out, countless countries getting access, effects completely unknown, help Trumps election campaign? need. need sensitive, mass-produced cheap (like $1/test cheap).

FDA needs approve mandate production *now*. No, no, no. See, matter deaths outpace births long death rate cause really small.  Oh wow! That’s great policy have. mine symptoms cannot come work use minimal sick leave. go acquire test cannot return get results. causing people run sick leave come work sick. However, HR “tracking” someone positive poop holes one gets go home. Mind you, capability work home April/May, work. doesn’t make sense playing lives. Extended family likely. think honestly mis read first comment apologize. think saying different way. im going right thing see saying thing different way. bad. time secure PPE, get ready play sick hunger games northeast governors play secure stuff. remember looking housing, 3 bedroom apartment trying fill last room two people. reached out, said would total 9 people living there. Two people one room, three people other, two people living living room. 

I nope real quick. Well responded posts far, pretty clear personal attacks. Whoopsies. Plenty evidence still transfers kids adults. may likely, mean factor based number community outbreaks happening child care facilities, include entire families infected children picked virus daycare.

One sources say apparent transmission kids. day care centers ending community outbreak spots transmission kids suggested several month old evidence?

Not sure think stand gain downplaying dangers here. see patients every single day conditions, wear masks... guy oxygen today mask on... 🙄 Arizona No. anything, made even less sense time. *Nobody* likes Americans. would curious opposite accelerator Florida Texas (besides obvious factors). hot humid eat gather outside, coupling re-opening dine in, bars, gyms etc thick summer perfect storm.

It could possible fall winter positive states since won’t getting even close 30F January. Ya stories pop up, would take everything grain salt. Pretty much anything coming soil that's years, DNA chopped shit. exceptions, think rare worry it. Well makes feel better states good job handling virus. can't really think any, definitely trying harder others bar pretty low. Either leadership lacking citizens refuse cooperate, cases both. hey, we're doomed together haha. says work going lay fire taking vaccine? really like use smallest apartment benchmark property prices usually linear scale. could find $1500/month apartments neighborhood, find much larger $2500/month single family houses, easily enough space four individuals cooperatively sharing space would otherwise spending $6000/month combined housing.

Don't ""be roommates"", form corporation buy property together. hypothetical four roommates buying power two ten unit apartment buildings. 

The limiting factor plan four individuals stable enough venture. Also people tendency want compete cooperation would get much further. 

But can't handshake lease. need corporation everyone involved skin game, corporation owns estate. 

I've seen work, really nice part Pasadena would totally affordable range group individuals, working together amazing place, ran course liquidated, everyone made lot money deal. mean ""start consulting business move Big Bear"" kind money. thinking loud, brother t-cell immunity, sister law antibodies? see Trump wanting prop tobacco industry like coal.  Trump dump works me! Heck, nowadays type notes phones! Yes. 

The thing we've learned virus veritable grab bag symptoms. Fever, fever, cough, cough, exhaustion, sore throat, body aches, loss smell taste, etc - like virus gets inside body throws darts symptom board decide going get. 

However, exhaustion muscle fatigue could something else, nothing all. know I've days I've felt like crap day two recovered without another thought. 

Do reason believe exposed someone virus? 

I'd start tracking symptoms, case (notepad phone fine). things go another day two, consider getting tested. meantime, act like stay home/away people. 

I hope feel better. little time essential work better treatment methods, testing even vaccines may help deal 2nd wave. cares \*feigns shock\* No, insanity limited Republicans, Republicans either.

Please stop making political posts Sub, see rule 4. ...I also live NYC cannot believe one paying attention gasp learning us cases deaths climbing NYC. What's sad police department giving warnings head police union said hes unsure police department man power enforce mask mandate. manpower beat peaceful protesters, can't enforce city mandate could save lives. gonna refrigerator trucks lined downtown end next month. think effective way, own. Level 1 trauma center, essentially PCR tests. Holding last handful traumas. 

Wife works there. Definitely nothing 100,000s people protesting multiple weeks dozens cities hours end screaming yelling extremely close contact one another. We're testing flu years, either. Comparing flu COVID-19 numbers really apples oranges way. Romania new Italy Europe. mess here. criminal imo. nice wealthy build little compound, almost certainly case here, many live multi-family dwellings.

Most crammed single dwelling try save money. used see lived Atlanta. could watch neighborhoods switch single-family multi-family driving evenings - streets choked cars enough room driveway them.

Most people poor. surprising woman article quarantine tell anyone. probably choice. probably quit work, did, house mates would ask work. might get kicked house homeless top jobless. back, highest upvoted post/thread. Time get new son. Also reading numbers bit wrong. top comment lays better. 10% positivity rate 10 positives 90 negatives. headline suggests 3 positives negatives (false positive) 18 negatives positives (false negatives). Netting increase 15 positive cases total 22/100. said, 20 person sample size statistically irrelevant. Great work. ohioan here, i’ve basically come terms we’re doomed lmao Much eastern Europe dropping ball atm. Shower? lol

A lot poor immigrant families like culture showering every day. try give US tests orange chief like ""NO IT""? can’t destroy vials? least ship space. really need send rocket mars. America fucked second real crisis hit incompetence charge. Artist best publicist earth apparently Internet ""questioning"" data articles show coronavirus situation improving isn't.

Compare YTD stock prices:

* Walmart ($WMT) $132, $119.
* Target ($TG) $121, $126.
* Lowe's ($LOW) $148, $120.
* Home Depot ($HD) $256, $219.
* Best Buy ($BBY) $97, $87.
* Amazon ($AMZN) $3110, $1889.
* Lululemon ($LULU) $326, $232.
* Dollar Tree ($DLTR) $96, $93.

Again, retail segments **people allowed shop**. **want** to.

Easiest way tell, compare companies allowed remain open (like big-box retailers, home improvement stores) niche things like cosmetics games. Allowed remain open? Up. Forced close? Down.

Simple logic there, hoss. ""want"" ""need"" ""forced to, way out.""

If penniless California cannot save money all, afford initial expense moving cheaper state? family help out? literally people get trapped poverty. Yeah seems case.

And see excluding multiple negatives positive rate calculation makes sense make sense exclude total test number. person get tested 3 times weekly work still generating 3 new test results every week. bet $5 free top 1/3, free bottom portion working class need vulnerable. airlines packing domestic flights like sardine cans? really? Cunt.

And can’t open schools yet. Children already forced go school sick pandemic, guarantee parent force COVID kid school without notifying anyone situation. public indoor activity safe. Anything indoors remain like April, essentials open physical distancing (and addition mask mandate). needs remain vaccine treatment breakthrough.

Where open things outdoors. Distancing still encouraged way leeway (exercise, hiking, golf/tennis, distanced gatherings, etc. okay need everyone's sanity). guy really likes gamble. Vegas money instead Sweden peoples lives.

Agreed. quite shocking many ""gut feelings"" assumptions gone Tegnell et al's decision making. Giesecke assumed it'd basically like flu went there. What's absurd say 'evidence based' making guesses based hunches gut feelings. 

I wish Björn Olsen charge instead. hell anyone remotely competent. Herd immunity incoming.

  
My guess first tested people sick people general testing themselves, proportion antibodies going down. 

14,5% Stockholm still av overestimate. brother live Stockholm tested (though via Werlabs). pay $80 test came negative. positive suppose wife would also tested herself. test negative quite sure would also test negative.

&amp;#x200B;

Another reason numbers go could antibodies lost people months.  He’s getting reports everyday decisions kill thousands people. imagine sleeping night knowing feeling nothing? 

Education/mental health excuses educated people who’ve never mental health issues. selfish person doesn’t care. PUT ASS. GODDAMN Time update intro part Idiocracy.  Death Maul Hamberder. country  

$25 per vial Walmart, even older type, much cheaper 400-600 you’re quoting. agree wish outlet science statistics could actively relayed. Whenever processing samples always weird feeling knowing I'm working probably positive.

It's bad there's way around it. get flash anger whenever I'm public see people openly ignoring masking mandates etc. think people really care end struggling breathe. control.

What control? Housing prices property values nothing function market bear. 

What factors drive people live locations cannot afford, factors encourage people migrate affordable locales? easy understand individual scale, simple macro scale. Bummer. one wants see this.  Snowflake Well people like help numbers. 60k day! Quarantine Centers become useful Free point use. Stop trying make front r/iamverysmart lying deaths. I’d bet anything real deaths 50-200% larger this. Check excess deaths year cdc website. explanation FL massive fraud. listening Greg’s podcast today. think one every country (especially one week) ambitious hope get 50. “Up Corona!!!!!” live west Baltimore, definitely freaking fuck out.  Absolutely true.

Far far people infected tested positive. guess could 2.5M lower higher. 

Not sure ever know exact figure. Yeah, virus magically vanish, death rate really low, new cases due bestest beautiful testing. Sorry forgot, ChIIInA! /s point fact contention - really part title one way other. worked great marketing; dad loved stuff hated sickness-induced idleness. 13 days seems insanely long. took test San Francisco, got results next day notified via text email. Guess worship Satanic deity Bill Gates can't worship Jesus right?

People like want civil war. fucking respect country, flag, God, nothing. bigger enemy America Nazis, Soviets Osama bin-Laden put together. arguing isnt bad thing? I'm arguing logical thing thinking emotions. Theres room both. Great Britain island look happened there. Oh population small? Taiwan 25 million local cases three months. Oh they’re island too? Vietnam 95 million local cases three months. pandemic simply revealing countries proactive leadership. academic journals peer review prior publication norm, happens time.

You submit journal. assigned reviewers referees. review, decision made journal whether findings worthy publication.

This standard process. going stand data point, 4K dangerous? daily upper limit intake (meaning number come from), much need take get hurt? What's LD50?

This easy looking RDA, that's doing. Orange County checking in. still wear masks here, fucked. Maybe different come from. brought UK, Midlands, invariably kull-dee-sack, unless fancy kid gets private schooling.

Where raised? Guess opened eyes happened around world, didn’t say “that can’t happen here” government leadership also took seriously, maybe would different place. 

My place employment considered small business too. didn’t push push push keep doors open regardless going around them. retooled business model, temporarily, got ppp loan cut 90% employees. Sure I’m ass, didn’t get bunch people sick kill them! almost right.

Lock downs closures required slow infection rate ""flatten curve"", remain nessicary long takes. impossible Healthcare system ""get ready"" massive wave infections capacity exceeded.

That fear, acting appropriately intelligently. Failing kill lot people, fear fact.

Now places waited another 4 weeks started reopening, people wore masks maintained social distancing, would better place stay open even continue re-opening. went it?

We re-opened early, people refusing wear masks, curve longer flat, hospitals getting overwhelmed, thousands people dying week need die. require massive second round lockdowns last new year.

Yes, lockdowns meant last forever, won't, last long takes people stop morons act responsibly.

If want want someone blame, blame states opened soon, states orders masks public places recently, people going out. American educational system also allows leftist opinions. heard testing positive later necessarily mean still infectious. PCR test detects viral RNA, may still present leftover without actual active viral particles government fucking stupid. 

Nope, American people fucking stupid we're ones putting it. Every single politician America elected. they're evil voted make us? dunno pharmacies give flu shots free year So, one hung her?

The spread viruses, one.

You've got kids going school sick parents can't take time stay home them, people going work sick sick time use little kids and/or management looks people take days thus perpetuating feeling take days going get fired passed promotion raise, etc.

All means sickness rips workplaces like crazy... that's normal colds, let alone one high infection rate. Next, trump declare hand making masks children Somalia since day 1 knows masks person alive true. Talk lack purpose!

This $$$$$$ Living US I'm really hoping N95 masks become available sometime soon. Cloth masks well good, given number people *still* see wearing miswearing I'd like able take steps protect spend time inside people (grocery store etc).

The virus US least six months. hip deep things yet? Government aside, think profit motive would drive production. I'd pay $5-$10 authentic 3M N95 mask. COVID-19 automatically make homeless, there's indication article imminent danger. fact, there's little information go here, know people assuming motives. think circumstances would justified.

I doubt people sometimes get kicked sick. I'm naive. matter course lying automatically justified. *much* easier kick housemate endangering lying sick.

I'd love hear side story. may good reason believe protecting herself. may one many Americans take virus seriously care human beings. Well hear them, me:

Personally, advocated outdoor meeting, leadership structure operate based opinion alone. agree, meeting indoors ideal. wish it. hands personally tied. insist meet safely possible. gist original post.

And yes, meeting without care lamentable. Personally, went back local shelter-in-place, would approve that. comfortable returning online meetings. Again, hands bit tied. Wtf wtf WTF FUCK wrong people?!??!! looked Facebook (I know...first mistake) within three seconds, three people taking trips. One Mt. Rushmore....ok... outdoors, whatever. One flying Miami, FL NC!!! actual fuck! person intelligent person . clue would now. another friend comments ""have fun, I'm going next week!"" understand people live like nothing happening. yesterday, KY governor told everyone ""please cancel trips"" mandating people quarantine coming many states knows people listen. sad. Apparently adult Americans entitled selfish ever imagined. 

Just get out.  Rant over. Smallpox straight gone, totally eradicated wild. rinderpest, cattle disease.  think businesses going want this. 

Do think would make problem masks worse?  Ok, that's actually funny. yeah could give enough time able find new viable host

and still isn’t clear research reinfections. could still virus body dormant. I’m Colombia don’t get tested anywhere unless maybe you’re ER hospital another reason.

You call number test house. testing centers here, either friend lying. muuuh freeedumb, 1st amendment, need oxygen breathe, it’s liberal hoax, etc etc Everything says based calculation it’ll win reelection. polling covid dismal, he’s trying seem proactive. He’s four months late masks. He's said he? Thats valid point regards COV-2 slowing faster might think. Studies indicate cross reactivity COV-2 blood samples people never exposed it. Meaning exposure milder siblings COV-2 might infer protection COV-2 itself. T-cell/CD4 reactivity could explain lot studies continue. easy do. virus situation also homogeneous globally. different various regions. many variables trying understand. Except....he worn Hope free though. Exactly. ever actually say work? Imagine butthurt insane sums money wasted failed military adventures feel need use GPS flex Russia GLONASS, China BeiDou, Europe Galileo. everyone think pecking order vaccine ideally be? think healthcare workers first obviously, first responders, essential workers, people service industries like restaurant servers interact public normal economy quite “essential” general public. 

I know see lot people say vulnerable people protected first, see point I’m sure agree. seems sensible prioritize exposure. lot essential workers considered vulnerable themselves, people protected. Someone necessarily get vaccinated earlier essential workers though able work home. Essential workers also likely lower socioeconomic status people color, absolutely need protection affected disproportionately. 

Elderly people (I’m defining elderly 75 older) obviously affected most, also able stay home easily people likely die causes. One goals vaccine get back something approaching normal help revive economy, younger populations needed that. Younger populations may underlying factors increase risks (comorbidities) people prioritized general public. Essential workers protected younger family members elderly vaccinated offer reasonable protection elderly. think start looking treating vulnerable terms risk means elderly, purely logical perspective people good think makes sense prioritize based exposure likelihood death diagnosed COVID. Elderly people prioritized. see may unsentimental though.

What everyone think? Eh schools provide lot services necessities lot kids. high acuity students attending school worse health (and likely health caregivers) virus. risk outweigh benefit. 

Keeping kids school table, moving learning spaces outside expanding resources distance be. costs money 🤷 Hyperbolic much...  ""Oh, damn. I'm taking polls. Maybe tell wear masks, I'll win over!"" 

Nah, bro. killed vibe. goons 140,000 deaths hands. Bye, bye! title summary ""The Harvard Gazette"" - NY Times. And, course, CDC.  course, never said thought ever good country, replying someone seemed to, showing everything we've done wrong.

I care change live dumpster fire. People dying needlessly, people, friends, neighbors, family. 

I tried word last sentence carefully, see could interpreted way. said ""Let's work make thought along"" meant portray ""let's work make *great* believed is"" 

I want progress, everything need really one worlds greatest countries. need change system mindset. US spends half discretionary budget Defense. 15% total federal spending. might still say much - I'm giving additional perspective figure.

There good arguments made money spent world's police force lot value preventing killing humans actually. simple quantify. easy point specific instances things seem gone wrong, along way single large scale war world powers prevented probably net savings tens hundreds millions lives. I’d even take three like hepatitis B, annual vaccine like flu shot, meant kids could go back school could get back normal. Report edited title vs making comment, then. didn’t say that, ideally one would die China virus never thing.

However, 0.045% population dying hardly “the end world.” Shit happens, many people die drunk driving year? don’t ban cars alcohol would gross overreaction.

The pearl clutching stop. I’m realistic person doesn’t make insensitive.

Destroying economy putting 10-15% country work also absurd. almost August, somebody handcrafted mask still news? mask manufacturers doing??? It’s years. Maybe forgot! :D Read wrote again. Yes 60% 1% detected. 1% severe cases.  .6% cases detected severe. severe (1% total cases) 60% detected permanent 10% redirecting. solve Covid19 go another disease, something that’s around decades hasn’t seen new treatments let alone cure, maybe something like ALS. guess thats another way flatten curve appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Genuinely curious - blog post “DataforProgress.org” count legitimate source sub, known aggressively removing posts “political”

This politically non-news post I’ve seen today. CFR estimate. caculated number based number cases. believe want use IFR here. would still incorrect, since IFR inaccurate calculated outbreak without sufficient testing.  Adblock? humanity needed. 0.28% NYC dead. 

0.58% Bergamo province, 1.7% ground zero town province, died well month.

0.01 1% consistent population groups. similar position myself.

Except managed FIRE year retire 34 earlier year. really going nuts. ""What coincidence happening election year. ya think?"" clench fists every time hear come someone's mouth.  know fact walk spitting you. Damn, lot people died today, seems like something this? 2 hours ago. Yes, we’re measuring dicks, let’s go back juuuuust U.S. existed. Herd immunity isn’t gained letting weak old die. could actually protecting first foremost rest population goes contracts gets vaccinated reach appropriate level immunity.. 

The argument making emotional one. lack direction country reach herd immunity without sacrificing lives, undeniable. However, herd immunity definition doesn’t require culling anyone. This, originally said wouldn’t follow governor’s order wear masks. 

Kansas one “uncontrolled spread” states right now, republican school board state officials focused getting Governor Kelly’s hands tied instead fighting surge virus. Same! Parents school aged kids red alert right headlines like send us spiraling (as they're meant to). Defeatist attitude. pushed far enough happen without fail. empires fall eventually. Oxford already nearly month phase 3 trials Brazil.... many websites say too: heads up...even masks work risk vs reward still favors nationwide mask wearing. There's major cost public. fascinating people react differently vaccines! rabies shots get side effects, Ive couple jabs like MMR killed arm day Something done month ago cases began rising Trump said stop testing, USA achieve case weeks. Let's reopen everything! Rename Darwin stores. Shitty stores boot. Hopefully anti mask idiots congregate there. Get workers. Remember Gore's ""lockbox"" idea roundly rejected mocked? Howard Dean's candidacy derailed one passionate scream excited chance work us White House?

It's one long-running joke. boot stamping human face forever. Democrats clean things well Republicans best throw tantrum shut entire government, Republicans come say ""hey cleaned things pretty well, think afford give cash buddies Company Inc. let's slash taxes!"" Also there's whole sub-plot Democrats ""turn"" lead, us get *crazy* idea maybe time elect someone reform mess Republicans left behind, *own party* fucks person picks milquetoast individual can, turn blowout victory election actually close race. Whether Sanders, Kucinich, Ron Paul across aisle, hell examples, one Ted Kennedy recall, born memory 70's/80's politics dim.

I get humans superior beasts pattern-recognition, yet apparently ~40% country even notice simple pattern. like it, know worse. Looks like conservative estimates. Still, nice work. Welcome second great depression. non mask wearers could going nuts reason. that's really good, yes, know Im generalising, changed think general social attitude toward acts selflessness vs acts selfishness.

Selfishness become acceptable, fact even *desirable*.

Whereas past *shameful*, folk least attempted seen acting honour social conscience, held high honour, made selfishness goal, founding principle, highest aspiration society. honour.

We conflate selfishness freedom liberty, whereas liberty goal whole society. demand rights, avoid responsibilities.

The Cult Me. Looking chart reading information, antibodies decreasing much span four months, unless I'm mistaken? titres actually appear increasing. even say fading antibodies likely decelerate beyond 90 difficult extrapolate beyond observation period approximately 90 days likely decay decelerate. 

I guess depends mean ""rapid"", overall seem like bad news. watch west wing. keep engaging wishful thinking comes damn virus. *Everybody* this. Everybody desperately wants schools able open successfully. want open without increasing funding giving help support able open enough safety precautions place. ignore risks, cross fingers, downplay possible danger, open wide hope hell turns okay.

“Here come save daaaay” U U   Wtf wrong you. Lol dude Facebook full old people yet, completely seperate things. Imagine that. forget, previous study showing also lower IQs less working memory capacity, top inflated self-importance. 4,028,362 Yup, public sector projects absolute failures comes funding. NIH? Constantly begging. Muhammad Ali science get professorship R1 university. Public schools? Underfunded, teachers considered essentially martyrs good cause. Public transit? absolute joke compared Europe, dirty, run stations, constantly late trains. Public housing? even worth talking about.

Oh except police military.

I tell federal government research bombs kill cancer. They'll probably throw million way without looking past title grant.  disagreeing points (especially last paragraph). 

I would also say, though, it’s racism. 

Sexism homophobia arguably big issues, time, went unaddressed last decades. 

I wanted highlight context matters comparisons (which credit acknowledged). dunno -- Pentagon flat lost trillion dollars one point. Honestly think there's plenty fat trimmed. powers willing that, problem needs solving, unavoidable reality life. practicing hedgewitch someone works herbs oils promote health healing. also work crystals toward end. I'm expert, years now. mostly, try help folks asked. many times gonna hear saving american lives telling us wear masks? they’ll get maced use lots military budget things. born Iowa City, visited years ago first time remember. It’s lovely small university town, it’s filled educated people (with country’s best medical research creative writing programs). wish best! also think it’s flu cold... 🤦🏻 Hang there, stay positive. need let mind wander infinite possible outcomes. Day day. I’m going recommend American people recommend Trump tested drugs suggesting lot 60-90 year old people who've never common cold? What? don't.

We want healthcare. fighting covid. Doggy style glory holes guys. 😂 I'm wrong, I'm dying hill, lol. graph daily new hospitalizations Florida goes back way controversy: http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/?chart=states&amp;highlight=Florida&amp;show=us-states&amp;y=both&amp;scale=linear&amp;data=hospitalized-daily-7&amp;data-source=jhu&amp;xaxis=right#states

I've monitoring months. That's disagreed headlines made sound like Florida hospitalization data withheld. Help government, help yourself.

Seems obvious yet ... not? seemed like NYC month ago we're bit behind Canada they? Americans know give damn coronavirus quarter think conspiracy likely   Lol wtf Thousands people upvote simply reinforces peoples' pre-existing belief people wear masks evil people science back up. Per usual, people even read article. live Oakland. Early pandemic, nurses/friends nurses nextdoor asking anybody bought N95 masks recent norcal wildfires donate hospitals, able collect hundred people. sucks hear Oakland nurses still protected like be. That's bacterium, animal host, herd immunity would really help. like innate immunity. cutting military budget half would solve education healthcare I've watching rt.live site think actually useful. believe looks daily cases compared previous day. take account things like positivity rate testing capacity. example state reduced testing similar number cases, r0 value increase pretty sure doesn't. Keep mind r0 1 means cases steady. Texas looks slight increase, positive rate high fairly steady. r0 1-1.2 probably right. Worldometer chunks ""days"" different times. government facilities ""spearhead"" this, giving money public privately owned business. said, receiving federal funds make available cost.

Vaccines human right, profit. #facts Americans stupid understand world burns burn us combat wartime deaths 1946-2020. If, example, quarter population contracted it, probability infected person developing severe symptoms 0.01 (1%), 10% severe symptoms die, gives 0.025% total population dead; makes perfect sense.

EDIT: makes sense 0.025% correct, I'm guessing put decimal point wrong place? case right make sense. Big ""beautiful"" wars, like WW1 WW2. Fuck duck. Come medical office. Lower risk grocery store. cleaning everything down, masks mandatory. Age factor puts high risk back school soon too, nice Kick ass sea bass  Lmao plague really? 

So one.. People sick locked away die, spread via contact. 
Two.. still outbreaks plague today, immunity it. sanitation standards pest control. So...you made argument human beings social creatures social needs, basically said grandma never gets see another human again.

Do elderly people social needs? grandma okay locked house couple years go parties?

Again, view situation selfish. Neither actors opera singers particularly wealthy Sweden. Typical upper middle class family, hardly rich. 7 billion people earth though. governor's poor choices throwing infected nursing homes definitely help. got coronavirus. Wasn’t bad. recent polls indicate he's poorly. also kind meltdown TV Sunday soft interview. advisors pushing hard turn back center he's going lose election. think part still empathy though. seems like people never work customer service retail positions often ones found throwing tantrums wait incorrect orders. masks like next step lack empathy aggravation. 


I wish way obtain correlational data this.   I’m sorry, thought America. loveee use percentages numbers small. would 50% increase, would 10% increase yet 50 deaths. See flaw perspective?

So admitting numbers trending consistently, trying write much?

Pathetic. least get another lesson exponential growth since obviously pay attention last media didn’t cover deaths per day falling 2.2k highs sub-1000. doesn’t generate clicks apparently doesn’t sell panic porn.

The dropping rate absolutely covered. fucking news sources using dude? ramblings?

And think helps argument deaths don’t care media asks president, they’re bunch talking heads. 

They media talking things claiming not, response ignore it?

Pathetic.

Just ignoring data make go data. That’s reality, Jim Acosta gang want peddle.

[You mean like data says going stop ignoring now, hypocrite? 70% peak, that’s awesome. Sure it’s coming little let’s see next month. can’t ignore 3 months steep decline freak 1 month worth slight uptick.

You absolutely deaths linked infection rate infection rates control. rising line rise infections. people upset people like want stop preventative measures watch people sure hope don’t invest, you’d buy high sell low outlook.

Lol, retired 34 investments dipshit. know it?

By paying attention data trends *where going* cherry picking data things cling play already proven wrong.

You trump sycophants fucking joke. hope someone real life knows spouting nonsense rub nose I'm mess things get worse. 600 last Tuesday Send Plandemic debunking: 

 Sorry opposing thought. thought america. 9 months 100% (estimated obviously) US population infected 4.5% (rounded) population dead covid alone. Thats bad.  Yes. THANK YOU!!! perfect eli5 post various respiratory therapies. ECMO seems almost like science fiction! Remind who’s ahead body count enter third quarter - police BLM / Antifa? obvious anyone reading headline. 

Bet also complain one saying ""car accident kills 2"" ""totally musleading"" soecifying 2 people rather 2 dogs cats. Earlier today said likes call ""plague."" went hide bunker. Let us agree disagree call day. Hi son kissing wife cellphone shows videos soul crushing. Even got good years see son, think Nick would put anything. fought goddamn hard.... wouldn’t believe Rachel Maddow anything last person earth. hear sound entire Biden camp REE’ing manstruating say that? Lmao edgy, good job! extreme position deserves mocked

Funny, would say thing claiming hypothetical bad things going happen try stop bad thing actually *is* virus .5% IFR IFR well .1% people 50.

Cite source .5% IFR. Also, like came said it. ""Don't worry guys, old people."" Yep, get it; you, however, don't.

""Lockdown lovers."" Jesus christ. 🤦‍♀️ RemindMe! 833.33 years wouldn’t technically Plutocracy given it’s heavy oligarchic undertones. rub makeup he's vain.  3 people house. 1 brings in. 2 infected within home. 2:1. Maths mean fair play, Coronavirus sub? guys wanted wear mask. wore mask. know guys still mad him. 

And virus came China. pandemic originates certain place, would think place negative. started pandemic. Showing age took good deal thought time wading urban dictionary figure meant. clarify, expressing affection Cedar Point. know it’s funny like “haha shit Americans, upvotes left,” thanks space race, military industrial complex, questionable intelligence gathering practices, could find (your country) map, could literally find *you* map. could watch take walk. yes, could obliterate you, “*you*”... realistically, you’ll able get exact position anywhere map, thanks GPS pioneered. 

The study really good. news article thats dumb. Spain months i’m pretty sure start time. actual springs sports start march/april fuck mean “if”? feel like maybe instead striking teachers look taking class action lawsuit government forcing dangerous situation, children. sure large law firm would jump many plaintiffs case Fox news, facebook one political parties responsible disinformation covid America. blurst words best words. Usually response people whining masks is

Raised middle finger. Try that. safest form communication zero risk droplets spreading covid. hope not. shit 50% mortality rate. estimated IFR sitting around .3% even every single person US got death toll would million. Fortunately would impossible everyone get it. assume herd immunity 70% leaving death toll 687,000 absolute worst case scenario.

Also number assume every case tested cases. Data already shown 10-70x higher depending location.

That current number infected going 40 million actuality. Well makes sense. Thanks car accidents occur close one lives.

That mean dangerous drive near home places safer drive great distances away live. Nyc handled best though heard Sweet, sweet chocolate.

I always hated it! war war crimes war illegally. stance official stance US place entering world conflicts since reasoning always acting form peacekeeper illegal conflicts. end gulf war resulted 9/11, that's absolutely victory.

If think anyone Korea, either side border completely happy situation I'm going say one time you. No, absolutely not. That's besides point however since war ended truce. truce victory.

Once again, NATO US one same. UK France excellent air forces, used Bosnia defusing mines carried aftermath UK arguably greater effort America's second round peace negotiations. Claiming war US victory based playing one miniscule part really clutching straws. worlds premier military higher standards justify extreme expenditure.


It's hard agree US prevented civil war civil happen shortly after. That's like British person saying world war 2 never happened world war 1. Plus, consider US strolled civil war, ran sharply taking severe beating, claiming victory would beyond short sighted.

NATO many powerful member states, without America always continue act. access active soldiers US 29 member states, access sizeable airforce, nuclear power members, access 5th 6th largest navies world. donate buy PPE/masks lot people issues nursing homes, they've also become scapegoat.

Norway never really harsh lockdown. way Sweden.

Something seldom gets mentioned Norway opened high schools already May 11, Sweden waited till June 15 ([this timeline *tiltak*). Wonder is... Fauci concerns (I.e., scares) him. realizes Fauci isn’t force reckon - least room camera. I’ll let everyone know see MAGA branded face mask wild. gonna happen unless weaponize it. toaster fire emergency? like 1.5% square footage house. need alarmed it, small item, like whole house fire.

Fire department 5 minutes maybe 10 minutes, soon right? Rasmussen started showing bad poll numbers too. reason dont understand seem poll numbers supporters think real. Remember Donald Rumsfeld talking 2.3 trillion missing, unaccounted money Pentagon? 2018 number 21 trillion entire government. money used bribes, kickbacks, illegal shit, etc never know about. insane think money could used greater good instead ""missing"" one seemed care never thought would see day... mention comparison military budgets world wife often adjust purchasing power. Hard compare budgets US China, US pays troop much Chinese do. US manufactures everything country pays good wages factories, China pays pittance comparison. Needs even freedom dont stats numbers lie. case counts deaths Sweden way higher neighboring countries avoid locking down. pretty clear Sweden fucked up. It’s Office It’s also little early “long term” studies Outliers demographics exist. virus go ""Oh hit 0.01 I'm done!"" live NJ got tested today. asthma plus known exposure(plus work med lab covid). 

My results still going take 7-10+ days. say working lab NJ test NJ. fact tests outside state. Even peak many tests outside. 

So labs cases many areas hence backups. 20 23... damn. Whole life ahead em, rest peace. Sure, definitely nice things terrible families endure insurmountable hardships,

edit:what's downvotes? Ah get it, actually sincere, read opposite know deep type mindset counterproductive right OK, would agree ""we literally never achieved immunity virus without vaccine"" false? throwing money problem work incompetent leadership free shit like recommending masks social distancing. Hey now, toilets *amazing*! realizing likely win trying win people acting like bumbling buffoon?

1. Brazil: 2,166,532

2. India: 1,194,085

3. Russia: 783,328

4. New York: 435,753

7. Florida: 369,834

8. Peru: 362,087

9. Texas: 357,127

10. Mexico: 356,255  Indeed is, [not Welllll actually indictments President, Donald John Trump. PDB extraordinaire. Spy Museum Washington DC section dedicated her. know anyone truly knows much country. considered hero, amount heroic work everyone, slaves, uncertain. California 40m people 8,000 deaths = 200 deaths per million

Canada 37m 8,800 deaths = 235 deaths per million This. 100%, plus fourth many places “flattened curve” causing less hospitals overrun therefore less neglected patients like saw widely Italy, Spain New York first blitzed west Banning public gatherings unnecessary travel proven quite effective virus.

What point think trying make? Italian report, read headline? Pics? Hey! I'm messing ghosts cause scary. there's lot Sadly appear plateauing cases fear lead people false hope. make people drop guard become positive wont tests prove it. say literally everything climate change, healthcare, taxes. We're ""not like girls"" country, things differently lose rebel identity. Literally first thought!! wouldn’t surprised sham company created one trump’s associates sole purpose making money government reporting fake data- data gets reported all. Several friends gotten tested due potential exposures tests came back negative Uh.........no. say that? americans really dumb think propaganda something foreign countries related? /s nobody left thinks axios left-slanted. founders certainly aren't, gossipy little amoral shits firmly center-right.

so spare us lies. unless find single person left posts anything claiming axios liberal progressive way. try! bringing fatality rate 10 times lower could seen coming Wow, that’s insanely irresponsible piece state propaganda. Except spreads, people end hospitalized. obviously die COVID, many also die lack available healthcare nurses doctors responders continue get sick die.

And 140k+ *confirmed* COVID deaths already joke.   1,122 deaths today. say many people dying wow wtf. something today like thay happened me! used vote Democrat watch Fox News purely rage would induce. COVID Universe trying rid excess garbage. Maybe “suggested” lockdown next month, let morons morons do, let nature take course Oh sure, past 4 years unforgivable can't wait vote fucking ass out, least mean time maybe cult start wear masks things get little safer. remember coronavirus joke meme subreddit serious posts went china_flu wear masks wear masks better people

You unbelievably obnoxious way jerk here, Jesus Christ. one upvoting interested it, upvoting says good things like (themselves) bad things people dislike. actually really like way said 'We starting form strategy now, identify vulnerable virus.'

It's like woke morning brilliant idea try protect old people COVID. 

New Zealander - government realized happening February. Shut us completely nation March. Closed borders outside world.

We (in general population) COVID free. Everyone sitting crowded restaurants theme parks happily without masks economy resumed. cases COVID NZ people returned home overseas. people quarantine. zero community transmission couple months now. 

22nd July - 4 months 100,000 deaths later, Donald Trump, President powerful nation earth idea something it. 

Vote people. let morons party run nation. Especially dangerous times. death numbers closer multiple Tuesdays ago. takes weeks people get sick enough die many cases, sometimes months, takes week sometimes deaths reported news. could deaths month ago many cases. #winning I’m gen x. I’m seeing peers become disillusioned bitter conservative. I’m surprised unengaged many well. Refuse participate. may better usual year though. misspelled Trump champ. Yup, news week saying vaccine progressing well, surprisingly stocks crashed today; I’m guessing rich fuckers buy more, dump em word goes vaccine actually failure. mean we're winning? /s population density like 1/5 sense time warped compared Americans. China Chinese New Years. landed mid January.

I heard rumors weird pneumonia rolling around Wuhan December even mid January saying human human transmission. got wife's hometown news didnt change. days later told everyone wear masks. avoid gatherings...which insane time. basically cancelled CNY

Chinese New Years biggest holiday China. basically Thanksgiving, Christmas, July 4th rolled single holiday lasted 2 weeks.

So basically said CNY locked Wuhan...I knew bad. Really bad.

I best warn everyone could home. Really felt like screaming void probably end April May people started take things seriously.

As world leader entire networks intelligence agencies back call...I dont know world dropped ball hard. 1. Although new studies suggest may able achieve herd immunity easily, they’re proven typically need 70% population get virus achieve herd immunity. We’re still far that.

2. False. Per [data Americans died COVID-19 fall age 40 60. Besides, preventable death occurs tragedy. We’ve nearly 150k deaths US alone, many could avoided common-sense measures nearly every country adopted extent success. Also, notion someone old deserve die disgusting.

3. one suggesting “live fear.” point, ask leadership show basic belief science listening decorated experts proven expertise time time again, institute basic mask distancing guidelines. yes, places getting decimated right absolutely locked down. 

Had done even basic prevention mitigation practices nation-wide, like many countries US could curtailing first wave now. Instead, we’re seeing cases ever before. way Doctor? Medic? Infectious disease doctor? Epidemiologist? Virologist? absolutely floors people believe stuff, knowledge somehow transmitted osmosis. That's things work ... father played clarinet professionally, cannot play clarinet shit, even though watched father practice every day. 

What know however, playing clarinet well requires studying, daily practice, dedication, inspiration, interest, never lightly claim able play father could.

I think Donald close enough uncle even remotely understand that. lord mercy fucked. quit grocery store job worried catching giving family. hard know made right call. Didn't... already happen months ago? experiencing deja vu? Fuck it, i’ll take anything point whats disgusting know enough bad virus spits unless hes disgusting angrr. like know dangerous still act like dont think pandemic real People won’t accept new normal, seen far. [Claw getting hammered. It’s hard proud Georgia home state right now. Albany gives hope. I’m watching unfold eastern PA leaving Atlanta February. went hell northeast Philly still getting hit hard, Georgia lost damn mind.
I know exactly feeling Albany right going hell March April watch one heed pain communities went time. shady shit, still probably do. oh my....this worse thought. already knew bad. stupid cause racist incidents asian-americans. gotten better naming diseases since days spanish flu(a disease likely even come spain). prevalent strain affecting US actually European strain virulent one initial one Wuhan believed come New York way European travelers. 

Stupid naming causes public stupid things. Trump using ""china virus"" messaging use anti-china messaging campaign (see cathleen wall ads coronavirus see might end looking like). wars pandemic? say report workplace. Saying ""some people"" vague gets

Yeah, also best answer right now, also irrelevant point making. people get effects, yes cases bad thing. Singing group, indoors. real quote case anyone wondering phrase “whipped cream shit” ever applicable something trump says?!?! Yeah, Fox news pushing ""it's bad"" narrative really fucked us. Hmm, looks like learn anything. Looks like coworkers care dying.

Some co-workers moan casino open. Trump electrolytes. He's got plants crave. populated state vs populated city I’m panicked all. Never been. understand situation.

I say are. said something completely find amusing...

Great. Even without context, still depressing headline. fuck ""Dark Triad?"" GTA3 mod? fight Triad fight them?

Do people writing articles understand academics fucking frozen we're facing generation children can't recite alphabet, let alone spell them? Ma-ma-ma-MYY-CHARONA! He's actually simpler that. likes people like hates people hate him. That's it. even said interview back 2015 2016. Except assholes throwing donuts spitting others required wear mask. constantly argue it’s killed many people reported more. increase death average way even higher reported covid deaths explain.

Most friends say “well people probably almost dead something else anyway”

Is thought process correct? keeping simple. pretty clear absolutely zero background science. I'm beginning think gonna trump rallies disguised coronavirus briefings. 138K deaths spike base states. actually says it. check. says it. CDC every really reliable j go anyways Yo he’s pretending care we’re good sure vote november guise .02% California already died this, spike started. Wild. life-saving part necessary, I'm honestly enjoying matching colors patterns hair/clothes/accessories. another accessory, pragmatic! said, first time voting. didn’t realize poll, I’m still learning ins outs elections. Part hoping cases rising again, quickly. butthurt pushed one peice bad advice, rolled back based new evidence? like push false information make daddy look better? quite. originally 2k deaths per day USA identifying around 25-30k cases per day.

Now identify 68k cases per day, even deaths climb back 2k official mortality rate article alludes would less half March / April. 

Based recent estimates, 2k deaths per day would equate 300k 800k actual infected per day. (.6% mortality .25% mortality) 

So knowing that, feel it? Hundreds thousands infected every day. masks become common across country remaining holdouts become crazier crazier. mean seriously, fuck pees floor Verizon store show upset? need apologize Hillary. right. people actually deplorable. Im sure mean that???  Always surprises churches even thing. Source? don’t need white Karen Trump reveals problems line thinking. can't bring elect platform without regard driving it. mean Trump leads conservative platform, whatever good Trump. conservative, I'd really pissed conflicted right now. amount mutations could happen latest mishandling could potentially make vaccine worthless. I've thinking lot totally honest, I'm sure competent leadership would make difference country.

Do thought exercise me.

Remember back 2016. Remember number people felt Hillary Clinton murderer, pedophile elected immediately put prison.

Now imagine election. imagine 4 years later, 4 years non-stop Hillary hate spewing right wing media outlets. Suddenly, dealing pandemic ordering common sense preventative measures like countries seen.

Do think there's chance hell things would've gone differently? quarantine order President Clinton would dismissed treated outright hostility considered conspiracy theory solid 40% population. might saying ""well, that's happened anyway"". Yea, exactly point. population problem end day. Poor leadership help, competent leadership made significant difference.

(go ahead swap ""Hillary"" ""Bernie"" makes feel better. underlying point change) personally I'm sick future. People Asia figured shit sooner. Well doubling every 40 days so. Let's back-of-the-envelope calculations

To expand growth (~1.8% day) logistic rather exponential. upper limit infection US approximately 230 million people (~70% US population). number people expected virus first month (assuming changes social distancing, masks etc) would be:

- August 4.77 million
- September 8.16 million
- October 13.6 million
- November 22.67 million
- December 36.23 million
- January 56.51 million
- February 83.32 million
- March 111.42 million
- April 142.96 million
- May 169.86 million
- June 191.326 million
- July 205.84 million

This assumes nothing changes. Anything flattern curve extend months. Even 10% reduction growth rate would result nearly 20 million less cases 12 months time, saving tens thousands lives. friend Los Angeles wait 9 days appointment even get test, another 5 days results. fair, sub actively wishes harm anti maskers. strategy worked

📉, 📉, 📉. way Rome England did, killing conquering. That's got land power anyway.

So right way get land power? effective way? 

See, problem look history darwinian eye. conquest way societies advance, works criticized. seem putting separate view morality it. words, huge cultural influence change horrors we've done, fact make example accepting responsibility.

You're effect saying societies either accept responsibility horrors...or victim horrors. means there's way society exist pride power. case, adjust standards. US, opinion, society proud of. People around world came became melting pot cultures integrated culture whole. Many people potential would never able show came make name themselves. lead important discoveries inventions etc.

This true. far lower degree help exists today. Many speak language know customs. learn, make name. children taught primarily American customs, next generation knew nothing old country, quite ready call Americans equally suspicious new immigrants. That's right way welcome people. Oh could pull Moses free everyone who's suffering, sadly, I'm prophet born super natural powers :/ I'm also freaken billionaire afford millions plane tickets.

Funny different interpretations words reveal character. said, ""my people,"" appositive was, ""my friends, neighbors, family."" that's took as. ""your people"" includes millions. millions friends? see part class millions? criteria class? cohesion I'm curious... would left? Everyone breaks back grunt work keeps country alive one cares them. cashiers? work fast food, construction, work factories warehouses? clean septic tanks?

This beauty capitalism, adjusts. market jobs dried up, price would rise. case, construction factory workers tend appreciative country So, like paying taxes 1%. 

I'd prefer taxes lower, also want low 1% make money, bring products market, hire workers, raise investment portfolio, etc. prefer idea people dying preventable diseases another big shot could keep throne cash. I'm assuming one otherwise what's you? people making money could ever spend lifetime help you?

I think sitting thrones cash. Thrones cash grow. Investments do. Investments simply efficient way think future. those--efficiency planning--are call says much. value materials others lives comfort. 

No, think lives comfort served better materials. either-or.  Fred Flintstone? US actual human beings deserve sick leave. ""human capital stock"" must continue working: Enzyme coated bullets /S usual, talking shit something clue about, case happens Presidency. Remember told us disinfectant UV light ""inside body""? Also, remember mocked LiBrUhLz wearing masks?

This guy knows talk shit, WWE wrestler without physical fitness. Damn, Altzheimer's become really deadly year. True, bernie would gotten young people vote. That's hardest group encourage go vote.
The young people could encouraged moderates vote him. mom moderate(grew blue house) I've convinced years Bernie evil. likes progressives now. saw HUGE banner saying NH weeks ago. felt slightly better saw BLM sign minutes later still depressing/infuriating. people full rage spite room empathy. We'd better longer here. 16 people?!? Since done willingly, be.
In Italy is, it’s criminal offense willfully spread disease term health issues Covid19 lot extensive lung scars.

Like what? Well, know, lot deaths caused covid/covid complications inherently go unknown due whole problem lack testing. Applauding NY odd thing—NY public health crisis world still knew virtually nothing it, changed behavior population level scale, go days without single COVID related death city still occupies basically entire top 10 highest population density metro areas. 

It’s far, far bizarre say fuck New Yorkers, still treat scorn behaved first week March, July New York modeled rest country currently going flames.

Edit add: need Americans (I one) prove someone else worse global crisis fucking stupid. Good one Trump. sure got us laugher. 😂😭 regular cold still exists, know. Every country capable hacking hacks. Welcome Costco, love you. baffling right party screwed taking advantage crisis. country center right party enacted strict measures worked great crushed elections two weeks ago.  guess, whatever reason, belief ""hands-off"" god seems less insane belief personally real, hands-on, interaction ghost, question asked. President day, Captain Obvious night! Sorry, get now. Probably something needs read aloud said, may invented new Dad joke. You’re right downvoted reason. It’s weird hear vaccine updates - UK team close Chinese team close, isn’t everyone working together? got great president Aus, soon tested assumed positive proven otherwise. told go straight home go anywhere reason get results back. tests also take 24-48 hours get result.  arseholes kept claiming hospitalizations deaths increasing despite cases surge? 8 months passed still don’t know lag behind. don’t want know. Anyway go hide find new stupid unreasonable excuse.  Pure fucking selfishness. I'm huge fan blaming stretch. largely failure community listen health advice. Meanwhile grocer exposes staff disease? There's potential liability there, too. always one somehow rationalises sad event stating victim obese. obesity solvable 6 months, easy 6 months become thin healthy? lost 20 pounds time hell struggle. Yea think US waaaay past containing virus now. People don’t choice. afraid losing income. virus shown flaws system. vultures definitely try cash  would need ask somebody drop groceries door. city Germany facebook group number call; volunteers you. Fuck, means 1% population are/have infected.  Also exceeds number prison.

Wow. think pathetic thing need told patriotic wear one...Are soft, side loves phrase ""facts feelings"" sure practice preach.  normally call prison lot people placing way much attention mask/no mask debate. conscious money going. Many people going die, people never died before. got tested Saturday afternoons round 3pm, got result (negative) Monday morning 7am. think probably ready earlier, thought would rude text 7am. (In Australia)  least Belgium every death yearly average counted COVID related. ended lot deaths countries. statistics easy manipulate general, don’t think White House trustworthy regard (and many others). Exactly. care objective facts regarding data currently have. I've seen lot articles bashing US worst.  article 3 months old. Maybe widespread work well... isn’t best world


*surprise pikachu face* never late start. quite possible contagious yet timeframe. Even were, possible infected anyone yet anyway. Then, even did, least prevent causing infections.

All said, chances infection encounter likely low, would still safe side.  long everyone stays corona free, bet learning kids would charts, super fun. Imagine attention kid would get. possibility valid complaint china hadn’t suppressed doctor gave warning, might kept virus ever leaving china. Florida 100% blame learning New York. stil needs spread. steady pace. Also think people household get next level stupid. Yes, grew one far think common language. next week: North Korea highest number patients cured zero confirmed cases. Article: U.S. Department Health Human Services Department Defense announce pact Pfizer 100 million doses Covid-19 vaccine approval, Bloomberg News reports. Americans receive vaccine free, according statement Pfizer BioNTech. information available Bloomberg Terminal. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Friends &amp; family, neither order number apps elderly tech savvy call Red Cross deliver some. Also shit ton young ppl volunteering. couple ways realistically buy groceries 10-14 days one go. Thank you! robust social safety nets. Lol would impressive see badly trump would fuck small country. Within months would coup Yep. Ridiculous. Yeah, here's US story comparison. slipped fell one winter couple years back, broke arm right shoulder. ended needing surgery single night hospital observation afterwords. also 6 months physical therapy, meds pain killers operation.

I back work sick pay ran out, that, would get nothing.

All together cost shy $60,000, I'm still making payments. think meant ""identifying symbol"" man, yes, recognize 'Rosie Riveter' see one. law? kind country USA? Ranked voting great. Neither two parties benefit it, therefore unlikely implement nationally. virus flaring Victoria, Victorian government going pay $1500 anyone symptoms/a positive test stay home fortnight. sad people think ""the restrictions fucking us"", asking ""why fuck one paying stay home await test results / recover?"" one first mentioned body piles - concept implies actual number deaths per capita. thing I'm following argument presented.

Looking body piles, looks twice bad Germany. Plain simple. do, thing posted comment with. It’s 2020. American capitalist 'freedom' nutshell. buddy mine told someone office (works medical office) covid.

he asked who.

his boss refused identify person.

he asked hell supposed know risky situation him...no clue near person recently.

boss said nothing.

this stupid hell. all. valid point ""Your favorite President""  grocery stores curbside only, would allow employees like cashiers, baggers cart people work curbside orders. Especially since virus Sweden continuously ""slowed down"" since mid April.

I've never seen unsourced speculations, I'm buying it. wear mask if, say, you‘re President make sure logo everyone knows important are. hard believe hospitals labeling deaths covid higher medicare rates either lol. I'm sure find lot topic online, pretty interesting :) getting tested Canada, told work home work all. worked home got results 2 days later. one low risk activities could though. low risk column, staying complete isolation/self-quarantine? Sooo.. regular day USA? Well Bloomberg full shit. supposed quarantine? would paid doesn’t go work two weeks? failures highest levels government. non Americans starting get annoyed US responded virus? 

It makes blood boil. Every single time new promising drug treatment US buys whole stock themselves, tried secure vaccine ""america first"", using money power get much ppe possible, time Trump goons act like virus big deal anyway save face economy. 

The moronic conspiracy theories, party pushed us government, also infect stupidest country makes defeating virus us also harder. never said made sense... Illinois here. Took test 12th haven’t heard back yet. 4-7 day turnaround. Tuesday went another location tested 3-4 day turnaround. We’ll see long one takes. I’m bored home quarantined want get back work. department small staff already two us week half. Trump brain dead? can't understand change info 5 months later.  son came grandchildren couldn’t let inside, visit mask outside. None wore one, me. said didn’t believe it. don’t understand sons line thinking, we’re drowning small Texas town. went 20 cases little month ago almost 900 county . Half cases town within county, population 1300. ra lupus I’m terrified. assume, like say, everyone even family members love dearly. go eat, water parks, much adore want adore years come possible guarantee woman doesnt put shopping cart back, least little bit inconvenient  think argument dumb reasons, don’t conflate case fatality rate (what you’re using covid) infection fatality rate (what you’re using flu).

For record, don’t agree acting reckless knowingly sick. cold (lower fatality either flu covid), stay home try spread it. cold Logistically entirely possible. Ups, Fedx mail services already daily basis. 
I suspect done two reasons:
1. (some? many?) Americans would doubt accuracy test results, numbers, came foreign country.
2. American decision makers avoid hint may handled situation badly. Got results yesterday. 18 days later. 

It took 18 days receive negative result. Yeah theory. Today announced people weren’t getting tests soon symptoms start weren’t isolating test result. that’s cases growing start putting stupid people ""sleep"" like sick dogs cats animals? think that'd best option. enough damage others around you, get put sleep. like pitbull bites kid. Pitbull gets put sleep. dumb assholes give two fucks others? Yeah it’s bit silly.  Rather France, even close. pay working? mean, I'm healthy weight ever gained weight recommended OB pregnancies (30lbs both) still managed bump overweight category time. Pregnancy pre-existing condition, even incredibly healthy. 

Maybe let's harp everyone's potential underlying conditions less though that's shield save rest us harm reality Americans kind underlying condition many even know it. could happen anyone, that's what's horrifying. Literally pregnant women higher risk. reassure me, makes feel worse. poor family. mean, guess get it, situation would mom side family, would way hell situation. dad, step mom, grandpa, siblings kids? Yeah, I'm close them, lived one point another. want go back single house em all, separate houses shared yard space? problem. guess actually liking chunk family makes crazy, could worse...  Yo that's messed up. regurgitates food command like smh doubt. believe God I've enough stuff ask forgiveness without throwing bombing hunderds men, women, children mix. frankly horrifying people claim Christian often pro-war. Knowing relationship God, think grants pass obliterating frightened children skin little darker. 

It's meaningless social club lot people. studied hospitalized patients hospitalization, continue study release. also mean symptoms disappeared soon got discharged. people test positive that's going anything who're waiting results. mess badly? world class job. first detect virus, first contain it. [The numbers Trump talking about. Yes U.S. lower death rate compared E.U. U.S. case load much higher. suspect deaths catch coming months. effort energy seven months testing currently circumstances zero utility suppression. utterly bizarre. insane that. Oceania always war Eastasia. Việt Nam muôn năm! seen studies show people still neurological symptoms 4 weeks infection, include things like ""fatigue"" ""headaches"". havent seen anything suggesting that. organ damage. Lots diseases leave ""traces"" illness body. AKA ""damage"". damaged lungs living polluted city. going affect life.

Considering close 2 million recovered Covid cases, would think lot people suffering major lasting effects would easier see evidence that.

You would tons people YouTube talking hard things since recovered Covid. wear mask nose sticking out! Drives crazy every time see someone that... Seriously! 8 hours mindless tedium lifesaver. Yes. 90% isolating properly. Ahhh classic ""they die anyway"". That's happens defund close public schools make university education attainable signing debt slavery. founders America believed strongly democracy working well-educated public body capable making informed critical decisions themselves. That's gotten lost recent years. 

So yes agree 100%. Trump symptom problem Anti-inellectualism also symptom problem. doesn’t work. Source: friends three months. sucks. It’s worth time effort. always thought need experiment much possible see works. work, figure one works best. testing attendees beforehand, FFP2 (N95) masks required. Fluorescent hand sanitizers used study way COVID19 spreads event like surfaces. 

Different option would read article. Also social distancing gonna practiced.

So low risk could be. It’s normal concert.  i’m uk. everyone think happen come winter? expect see second wave not? everything conflicting, heard multiple top level scientists end viewpoint wondering anyone could shed light it? POTUS makes sorts rules - senate house congress little without cooperation said senate.

People voted shitheads occupying senate think real issues affecting America gun rights poor foreigners wanting cross border chance mow someone's lawn. open 2 weeks 2 week turnarounds results, unless pay people isolate await results, regardless positive negative, simply going get tested. understanding (you probably read book get complete picture) Trump cheated Fred Trump Sr descendants significant sums inheritance. people complained retributed cheating even more. twice? That's American way. working hospital fall save using private insurance companies use. fact pay much means get pay less.

They want rich person healthcare, tax dollars pocket. *we surveyed discussions several COVID-19 patient communities high fraction members groups describe symptoms strikingly similar patient* 

Do know kind fraction is? 1/50 patients 1/5? atheist president right now. guy never mentioned God religion anyone became politician. asked question bible immediately changes subject, gives ""i like everything bible"" sort non-answer. 

Trump greatest example actual religion, acting adherence religion, completely irrelevant unnecessary. suck religion crowd they're sated. Probably autocorrected “Alberta”. survey across 3000+ cases. That's lot towers. hell get much money 90% positives isolate showed symptoms 53% isolate getting tested. 
What want know paperwork says isolate getting tested showing symptoms. Surely make blanket rule give exemptions people like PM assume get tested frequently. Faux Media subscriber day, Captain shitpost toilet. heartbreaking beyond measure, hits close home. wife 7 months along tension anxiety been...high. 

Communication cornerstone don’t let know maybe fifth worry. She’s job - healthily that. 

Being parent mixed blessing times kids virtual school fall.  money they're savage Literally illegal charged murder anyone affected dies. That's bs right there. Seriously, sometimes glad China went ""maximum 1 2 kids"" rule

You mean rule that, addition violating peoples' rights, led many murdering female babies? way.

I ride elevator myself, walk hall mask, go office close door, work day without seeing anyone. little risk involved.

My wife jammed classrooms 25 kids, sometimes face face them.

Even setting cubicles, spread way apart classroom.

Not even close risk. brutal death rate. Every one unique irreplaceable person life story ambitions plans to-do lists - taken time thing could limited damage months ago better action. spit masks

Wow I'm ashamed say first time 28 years I've seen one I've never hit anybody adult, somebody lost dad this, would probably answer that. kind dole payment something?? nuts! covid supplement Australia (I work aged care) business claim pay employees sick days related covid...   That's First Past Post Works. amount magical thinking going change fact FPTP system gravitates towards two possible choices. tell he's devil incarnate, lying leading people hell? 100 million? population USA 330 million. subtract anti-vaxxers, careless, ""it's hoax"" crowd, think flu, happy-clappers cure thoughts prayers, people can't afford vaccine, 100 million might enough meet demand, would sad. suggest long protesters wearing masks outside, risk spreading covid.

No doesn't. suggests experts think little risk mask outside.

No one, single person medical background, said measures, even combination, gatherings *no* risks. Even risk 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001% greater risk.

And last point adding word think. could wrong. They're supposed wrong sometimes. information give us could change. thinking educated backed evidence right now. may change. protest means keep ear new information reliable sources.

Choose words wisely. huge difference said said. Found despot live someone didn’t get it. brother also lives someone didn’t get it. mentality silly dangerous forced work, safety net available America don’t, willful.

This failure system, individual.  Yep. actually reasonable late. Can't we? /s believe correct way contact tracing, copy-pasted literal title time post. Contract must generalized typo meaning make much sense. I'm doubting Capital Economics' abilities, economic forecasts particular countries report seem optimistic above-consensus. love trump's incompetence ploy. yes, stop Trump re-elected bad handles everything. terrible president. I’m Bermuda. universal free testing everyone, sick not, plenty tests. shortage tests, shortage governments willing pay adequate testing.  I'm going forgive people flip flopping masks trump following. people life shown true colors bridge burnt.

I'm going forget put peoples lives danger, harrassed us trying protect rest us.

You marked, posts saved. I'm kind guy go anyone, know longer worth time.

Honestly, cares wtf think though. anyone actually gotten call contact tracer someone environment coming it?

I’d wager guess call isn’t “Susan got may get it” rather “we identified someone contact current COVID-19 patient. should/have follow following steps:...” I’ve seen lot stories lately people “recovering” dying kidney liver failure weeks later. scary virus. aunt tested positive covid surprise! mom siblings showed house yesterday, ended isolating family. believe mean ""at will"" states.

Right work means can't forced join union get job AFAIK. 15 people room someone house decided right time another one? Selfish. Karens: GOVERNMENT like buying condoms whilst wife labour. little definitely late. Karens Kevins might worship won’t work 5000 - (75%) 3750= 1250

Yeah, double remove bad mistakes elderly. like result right? United States pay $1.95 billion Pfizer produce deliver 100 million doses Covid-19 vaccine candidate U.S. proves safe effective humans, government announced Wednesday.** fed

1. quick possible administer someone little training; people waiting airports, etc., hours time, loss productivity (and fact crowding healthy people sick people) counter-productive;
2. reliable;
3. detect disease almost immediately infection takes place. 

While test could meet criteria, there's point letting someone country currently asymptomatic, undetectable infection levels, full-blown patient within five days. 

Similarly, once-a-week testing cashiers, etc., optimal could asymptomatic significant portion time tests, even tests quick reliable.

This also fastest we've ever worked make vaccine... Ever. We're rushing like crazy, production one even begun final test results back, case they're good, already started. Vaccines generally safe... *because* they're rigorously tested proven test time. vaccines caused serious injury disease before, pulled market. rushed vaccine ever understandable even necessary that's Great. Hopefully first market (there 112 vaccines development close done) safe effective. - recalled makes people sick, even work - there's going big wave mistrust vaccines general, second third market product much better see less compliance would followed club.

Then there's supply. may formula good vaccine, inability manufacture enough quickly. better none lots people hear ""No"" initially. n95 supply still lagging badly half year later.

Then there's distribution. Getting supply safely, hands medical staff administer it. bottlenecks there. Affordability may huge issue, especially US. good vaccine, widely distributed new year's day, would massive stroke luck understand it. Like every two days? swear people think test immunity.

I feel police bias critical factor Rhode Island’s directive. [Stanford assessing national police finding black drivers likely pulled likely searched pulled over. good critical assessment within study trends really considered imply.

New Danish study clarify sequelae coronavirus five years ahead.


When first became acquainted coronavirus beginning year, reports virus respiratory tract, worst case could develop pneumonia.


But since then, researchers around world become wiser, turns virus cause great damage long run.

According Politiken , large study King's College London, England, among 8,000 previously positive covid-infected 1 10 patients plagued late effects disease varying degrees. Many affected several months actual course disease over.

At Rigshospitalet Copenhagen, chief physician professor infectious diseases Jens Lundgren one leaders field Denmark. says study underway look sequelae whole five years future.

- January, knew viruses airways could cause pneumonia, turned experience Europe United States viruses also harm basically organs meaning central nervous system, heart, kidneys cause neuritis arms legs, says Jens Lundgren DR News.

#Not seriously ill affected

It shown people affected differently coronavirus. However, patients seriously ill coronavirus risk long-term damage.

- may expected seriously ill hospitalized, also happen patients needed hospitalization infected. may ill really long time, says Jens Lundgren.

In beginning, virus-affected patients followed 28 days, got impression patients recovered. patients followed least three months.

- virus problem, damage virus body. extended follow-up time able understand analyze long-term consequences, says Jens Lundgren.

#Five years follow-up new study

But three months enough give answers. study launched five-year follow-up corona patients.

- want sure understand long-term consequences, says Jens Lundgren.

The plan investigate avoid effects, possibly medicine, acute disease.

Only 20 patients admitted Danish hospitals Friday due coronavirus. week 13, number 589.

And treatment coronavirus patients made great strides recent months.

Two preparations particular effective. One Remdesivir, liquid drug, originally developed treat hepatitis C. used standard treatment patients need oxygen. second remedy Dexamethasone. Unlike Remdesivir, Dexamethasone works best patients ill. yes teaching really work. seriously take look happens people subjected abstinence teachings. ugly 1) jobs

2) far efficient distribute resources transport people 10 mile radius 100 mile radius defense person willfully infects others way stop accountability. Thats side responsibly adult. Take risk willing pay goes bad. excuse HARM others assume anywhere go people it...


This correct approach. Testing lagging bad moment numbers seeing today, (those daily results get splashed news), actually old news. point testing serves purpose really national lockdown again. 

We've proven nation suffering multiple pandemics. Pandemics entitlement, selfishness, ignorance immaturity. children need sent rooms many us know behave public. can't nice things. There’s 4 either start final phase. vaccines, better. It’ll impossible one vaccine maker make enough vaccines 8 billion people.

I wouldn’t shocked point next summer there’s dozen vaccines world wide finish Covid  ICU due PEs Thursday last week, tested covid. Still results, dont it, still awaiting results. Yay Missouri! queer person. deserves death tenfold blood hands. matter people liking him, he's domestic terrorist. Yes. also require paid sick leave everyone awaiting test results, regardless test result is. Anything less incentivizes everyone can't WFH avoid getting tested think might getting sick, know come back negative, get paid work miss waiting 2 weeks test results. Ah yes federal vs state issue... agree stance workers, *raises hand* , that’s me... fact can’t get federal job due MMJ patient status ridiculous. hope pray fix .. ugh many issues going on. Stay safe  Physically, store closed, curbside pickup, open operationally. That's worry vaccine well. anti vax, plan get shingles pneumonia shots appropriate age, I'm keen rushed Covid vaccine. Either effective claim, ""oops"" rushing devastating debilitating side effects. Best voting advice give you. vote based whenever wear mask not, whenever recomend masks, popularity, who's smarter stupider. vote personalities public image. marketing. 

Vote policy importantly vote consistency. promised today, delivered promises yesterday. 

Do research go news outlets it. biased, them. Reinfection possible, unlikely. They're downvoted giving misleading information. Every single virus known humans rate reinfection. vanishingly low rates. exact rate reinfection COVID-19 still scrutiny, there's reason believe large enough worry societal level. heaven forbid talk real route issues sub. Automod stop meaningful conversation. **didn't tell roommates,**

...ehm, anyone offer alternative housing? going happen? state concerned, couldve kept hospital. get tired seeing comments like ""the teacher even grade anything!"" control like either.

I'm blaming teachers, I'm worried continue coming school year. There’s questions ask basically narrow time frame around 2-5 days first symptoms. told specific time place at, many people there, whether people wearing masks, etc. it’s pretty much boils best guess Lmao many things wrong here. would look overall deaths measure state dealt pandemic? Let put like this: overall deaths look like 📈your state handling COVID well, overall deaths look like 📉your state handling well. total number deaths second graph higher nothing well it’s handled. 

And think NY control borders? can’t shit, millions people pass NY day. United planning verify passengers wearing mask airport? without verification, PR United. apt analogy would replace cherry lemon meringue. Still hate calls China Virus instead real name  mean, symptoms test herself. COVID, got like 100%, want test ASAP even develop symptoms since live family rn want distance early on. heard taking test early produce negative test.....

Exactly, that's trying consult many days relatively accurate (1, 2, week, develop symptoms??). near death prob better, fear instability would hurt worse There's even incorrect association Spanish Flu, origin unknown.

It actually thought originated Kansas. issue idea people would still three children, children would go hungry.

You would effectively punishing children sins parents. really understand logic school districts going expect parents able manage different rules different aged children. still educate older kids still zero risk younger kids spreading virus. Washington Redskins change name Washington Riveters Rosie logo. goodbye. Careful screaming new vaccine. ultimate cure marketed for. Sadly killing. dad died last night. went since March, doctor's appointment one get blood work. wore mask whole time. Covid took less two weeks later. Stopped reading comment halfway letter vomit let die cares do? obviously dont.

One less trump voter sounds like guys wanted wear mask. wore mask. know guys still mad him.

You're god damn fucking right I'm still mad him. fucked up. late fix it. Schools open month FUCKED. want tested put quarantine. Considering Americans biggest exporters virus, China well within rights make measures mandatory. says lot overall failure democracy can't accept nuance debate anymore. 


It's pretty obvious lower class overall society would benefit sustainable family planning, say loud, get hounded anti-life racist whatnot, rather actually debated merits. jail. different purposefully knowingly spreading std/sti. want experience “tech” culture aka expensive activities bars restaurants ubering everywhere Even without vaccine they’re holding them. There’s absolutely way lose even money this. source doesn’t really support long term damage anyone except people severe case hospitalized/incubated, people age 50 good chance asymptomatic Call FL half deaths NY.

This surface level analysis obvious predicted since March. old people FL! Disney FL! opening beaches! Wait two weeks everyone dead... still waiting. Part aren’t testing it. Basically testing covid majority cases. lot labs knocking back request respiratory viruses due lack reagent. anecdotally yes seeing lot less flu year he's copying ""the north korean hairstyle"" regulate hair styles north korea. legal hairstyles, women's. saying ""what counterfeit bills"" ""what shirts shoes required"", without addressing point, people risk harm violence try enforce mask compliance own.

And point, ultimately, businesses charge enforcing mask mandates? Let's follow logic second: business make employees bar customers wearing masks. employees use force necessary? take beating customer chose escalate? worker injured confrontation, gets covid unmasked customer, business owner cover care? customer injured, business owner pay? anonymous tested positive shared information best friends family, is, incidentally, people included contact tracing. like cause effect, obvious me. NY NJ 10x deaths per capita Southern state 😬😬😬 right. much better idea resort self-delusion make people feel bad uncomfortable due negative (read: realistic) view world. bet order better fake testing kits China. real problem time testing results. someone gets tested behave they're positive, many (most?) don't. positive also enough symptoms warrant getting tested really need isolate. Absolutely. Ridiculous. 

So they’ve gone ahead repealed rule contact tracing must done someone competence anyone sick themselves. explicitly [WHO guidelines]( tried Denmark failed. somehow thought wouldn’t go nope: they’ve done repealed regulations. It’s even worse it’s general repeal affects diseases like STDs well. Absurd.  Maybe we'll get lucky &amp; CoV-2 kill Yelp, too. Archive link: patients greater extent infection trace call around people may infected.

The Swedish Public Health Agency made possible repealing old rules.

The decision made Monday thus Swedish Public Health Agency's regulations infection tracing longer apply. Pending new regulations, authority publishes non-binding guidelines infection tracing carried out, one general one specific covid-19.

But even today, patients track infections own, despite fact far really allowed exceptional cases.

- fact, healthcare make whole series decisions order able delegate responsibility, done time. worked. complicated be, says Bitte Bråstad, General Counsel Swedish Public Health Agency.

Now person tested positive covid-19 easily responsibility call around people suspected infected. applies infectious diseases chlamydia.

- much better someone sit infection tracking unit it, says Bitte Bråstad.

If person considered suitable manage infection tracing due to, example, dementia substance abuse, care must hand responsibility. whole, people able cope task, Bitte Bråstad believes.

- patient ordered test assume patient manage detect infection, says.

The need changes great pandemic Public Health Agency several legal issues resolve spring, rules restaurants. authority hire ten people legal expertise.

- worked around clock different rules, says Bitte Bråstad.

**TT: changes infection tracking needed already sports holiday many came home vacation?**

- sports holiday, need change regulations infection tracking worked well. Many passengers found, number infected many, need change regulations become pronounced. 80 hours. Get tested, wait 2 weeks negative results, that's it. better hope actually get sick, employer decide whether get paid sick leave actually ill, that's employer 500 employees.

This laughably inadequate. even really giving businesses option creating environment incentivizes people go work sick fingers crossed cold? employees small businesses? decided we're ok creating incentives people avoid getting tested first place, can't afford miss work? I’m shit! reason science needs peer reviewed published. 

Yesterday saw two articles stacked google, top one said “still Americans contracted coronavirus” second one said “coronavirus cases probably 10x higher originally thought”

Now know point, statements likely correct lot people see stuff forget science lot guesses it’s proven...they assume science fucking clue don’t trust anyone. really agree that. need societal response hope eradicating virus. like country biologically disposed beating virus. suspicion spike due schools open month (it's different schedule used western nations)

the lag surprising considering many cases things opening back up, starts spreading youth, going see many symptoms til pass families

for lack action japanese government taken, one things one first countries close schools. rest country's good fortune comes largely general public's good sense masking, distancing, etc, may seeing undone Yeah. remember finding premise NCAA tournament may cancelled group gym class. shocked. Clearly turned right decision, situation really rapidly went nothing ""we've never made responses like before"" Sounds like kind place I'd try remember eat year so. “Last time gave SHIT, got FUCKED!” Brains... agree theory. reason teach managing personal finances school. I’d rule government stops assisting childcare costs 3 children. Remove incentives breed people smarter let ask, tf different std telling anyone? 

It right? Americans love pick choose want fight yet never pick choose revolt government shitty food, poor education, insane Healthcare, low quality products.

The dumbest dumb. pays development? 

There world government evenly raise taxes across world. LMFAO. wonder goes minds people deny COVID get COVID. Probably nothing, since brains full steaming faces. understand little bit situation... living house 5 adults 11 children kinds bills ain’t going easy adults. likely end losing job co-workers end testing postive, along sanitize work areas.

Currently America joke. Nothing really happen they’re FAR many people infected states even contact tracing enforce quarantine. 

The government America like ”You survive $1200 couple months right?”. Meanwhile Canada we’re getting $2,000 dollars month every month since April 1st. Seriously. even admits “If they’re aisle there’s one aisle, let pull breathe little bit, unfortunately, people see think, ‘they’re wearing mask,’ call immediately state complain instead just, ‘ok, don’t mask I’m going keep 6, 8, 10 feet,” said. implied contract exemption regards employment.

I'm sure extends situations.

However, Florida exemption anyway.

Talk employment lawyer. Find one give free consult.

It may worth pursuing. gain vs lose? lawyer would help nail things are.

Edit: also broke ish pro bono lawyers. 16 people?? live, sorority house?? That's crazy. cousin works Walmart co-workers wife test positive. immediately removed co-worker anyone worked past week schedule could test negative. Test results also within 24 hours. Turned one extra cautious. waited 12 days Arizona test results. Didn’t feel sick then, feel kind sick now, I’m sure I’d get results back again. duh last thing want point shit US gets, country reports figures realm trustworthy, whether economic otherwise. lie like everyone else, course. leave US, accountability drops tremendously. 

What's source this? 2018 average metro household Geneva earned 105,000 American dollars year. San Francisco figure year 107,000 dollars year. statistics OECD Wrap already! workplace would send home, use sick days, vacation days, say you’re luck - pay you. That’s literally happened luckily end fiscal year 1 sick day left never put gfs dad waiting 25 days now, welcome FL Summer bad time hitting record highs. Right want minimise infection Fall Winter outbreaks massive. Open schools combined dining, events moving indoors due cold terrible combination effectively handled infection low moving Fall. Pretty simple: coronavirus spread society = reports work. people held accountable actions. Make people example like HIV Except that’s communism is. United States already threatens gunpoint taxes don’t pay them, serve time prison.  think people legit medical conditions make wearing mask possible? solution face shield better nothing. That's stores accommodate employees can't wear mask medical conditions. things spike slow. US absolutely hitting 100K / day Aug 8th. sure people feel need root calamity. 

!Remind 17 days I’ve lived life, expensive it’s expensive 16 person household common. That’s extreme poverty right there. argued virus though liberal caller right-wing radio show, they’ve lost debate.

Reports serious coronavirus-related incidents work continue flow Swedish Work Environment Authority. date, 2,600 applications received. Nine ten reports care nursing.


The majority reports workers risk infected covid-19. exposed work mainly health care, 2,327 reports serious incidents made. total 2,647 reports Work Environment Act linked corona received Swedish Work Environment Authority.


Most applications received Västra Götaland, followed Stockholm Södermanland counties.


In April-May, number registrations highest, went increase July.


- believe continue reports, employers safety organizations know serious incidents work must reported Swedish Work Environment Authority. also think deficiencies protective equipment things, says Kjell Blom unit statistics analysis Swedish Work Environment Authority, follows statistics reports coronavirus.


The notifications continue flow in. also applies cases safety representative requested safety stop intervention Swedish Work Environment Authority. addition health care, relatively large number complaints concern transport sector, buses taxis.


Ann-Charlotte Althén, statistician Swedish Work Environment Authority, says reason high number transport industry is, among things, safety representatives' demands close front doors.


**TT: shortcomings rectified now?**


- thought employers know applies. read reports beginning, careless, went without enough protective equipment get information patients covid-19. think obvious shortcomings common anymore, things.

#Facts: Corona-related reports


Since week 9, Swedish Work Environment Authority following number corona-related reports serious incidents work. many reports received Swedish Work Environment Authority week week: Ah yes. People die lockdown, virus. seriously believe this? Yes, virus circulated even late 2019, also mutated apparently became infectious.

It's also known fucking flu. virus attacks whole body, wherever ACE2 receptors are.

We also know virus damage body immensely - death rates.

You see happens without lockdowns US states right now. making fun biden, masks, hes specifically stated masks fine. fact every article careful say “seemingly” mocking Biden unclear intention.

And every article posted one showing ineffectiveness masks several place posted them. google it. didnt say believe it, saying adding confusion, especially mandates require mask, doesnt matter material. one well verse best practices wearing masks become ineffective anyways believe general consensus accurate time take test around 3 days symptoms appear. 

Taking today absolutely give false positive. 

Right now, act like stay home. Thoughts prayers, US. I've yet meet hear ""mask rejector"" remotely resembles kindness. They're filled rage misinformation zero idea process facts versus opinion.

Pretty much antithesis saying. Ignorance born fear heroic position maintain. Trump holding Goya. Sixteen people house awful itself. Still enough wants one  2nd half Karens Kens. They're patriotism inconvenients them. Let's talk eugenics. 


It eugenics say poor deserve children, outbred elite. 


It's eugenics say poor folks benefit 2-3 kids obviously affordable, sustainable likely grant children opportunities better education job future.

You're trying create gag rule likely problem. we're wrong, prove data debate, mere 'you're eugenics monster' reply.  Prepare rage! avoiding politics months made mad af sticking head sand worked Corona happened. Turns effects world politics seen streets now. Stay informed! Fairly positive. spent lot time outside exploring building things like forts boats. Let say upfront find abhorrent arguments make minimize seriousness COVID comparing numbers killed flu, etc.

Nevertheless, suppose COVID19 deaths replace future deaths cause (car accidents, heart attacks, etc).

I tend believe best way measure deadliness COVID way people respond compare mortality causes historic trend cause mortality. virus biological problem, sociological problem. countries way eradicating virus. you. playing devil’s advocate, could around well. Controversial subject pessimistic sub, know, important view sides. “muh constitutional rights!” 
*screeches freedoms*  kid usa used shining example progressiveness tolerance people country think America billionaire ruled country global Bullly treats citizens like crap even giving healthcare education free seems pretty close vaccine, hold school fall like cmon whats 1 semester I'm still holding hope alien invasion UFO drop earlier year. ""we know god""

well maybe god d*ck Quite experts others made prediction now: DK probably move towards mask wearing fall. 

That said, may hell time comments FB page article indication. try avoid linking FB Reddit, go DR Nyheder's page find pretty easily. people seem *really* happy idea. Ofc comments comments necessarily reflective public opinion large, still bit deflating see much idea disliked. Well, we'll see fall goes. think wear caseload starts ticking even last week two.  impossible. US free democratic country never hides lies. average apartment SF bit outlier, housing prices vary like everywhere. 

I’m hour half outside SF (North Bay) two bedroom way less one bedroom studio SF. could get nice home amount moved Central Valley. Could anything nationwide protest going right now? got banned enlightening ""words wisdom"". Lol. Nice way put it. opportunity leader needed it. failed. One biggest disappointments failure convert empty hotels isolation space.

You're positive need immediate medical care? Go live hotel two weeks, deliver meals.

You possible contact waiting test results? Go live different hotel results come back.

You working covid-positive people concerned spreading housemates? Here, room board. recent immigrants Africa, India, across Asia make money per capita white people? Sounds like weird kind ""racism""  Lol like bad. I’ve wearing masks fifty years nurse. Fuck people excuses wearing them. people taking seriously? Im seeing less less day. like joke here. masks worn like fashion statement see people pull talk chin worst even wearing all. dont get it. people scared? 100 million doses, third country get vaccine. rest country, cronies toadies? also doubt people get free. averaging 100° + last couple days stupid people going stupid people do. Cause otherwise, it’ll mostly voters die november. like woman one bit. right,you right there's people keep this? think coronavirus least worries percentage population think insecure sense self? would guess double digit number.

What percentage population throws fit grocery store? Probably single digits.

If hard believe? said another comment, people feel passionately whether pineapple belongs pizza, hot dog sandwich. say ""I love pineapple pizza"" check out? People would light store FIRE

Know species. we're like! 🤣🤣 ridiculous! case ""sniffles"" him, amiright? That's great! pushed free, gov Pfizer? don’t know work company two companies America handling way mine same. Good job right talk memory T-cells ignores fact humans get coronaviruses again, immunity lasting 6-12 months best case.

The dream T-cells immunity supported facts. Cope Amen. mean worst way possible. Jesus Christ, state’s response, locally much larger scale, abysmal put nicely. Well last week ended putting spaghetti sauce rice gave fresh tomatoes pasta (stores plenty pasta, substitutions suck)

Even get 90% picks, end multiple non-meals, least odd meals. Thank god im chopped style cook recipe guy.

And instead non-dairy Cherry Garcia given regular kind, waiting home tempting pint delicious ice cream flavor ever, except give temptation I’ll turn shitmissile 6hrs.

Don’t get wrong, still use beats panic attack grocery store... think things like legitimate complaints. casinos basically racket anyway. give shit raking cash. soon lost all, free leave fucks given.

&amp;#x200B;

Think care sick people? money good. rapid test done CT - nasal swab. 18 minute wait results find 60% false negative rate doctor. Second swan sent takes 5 days get results. It’s 12 days yet hear second swab. took way long find comment. I'm excusing all, choose roof head food table, quarantine, wonder one pick. sent Bob Mattress King put 100 new mattresses basement /s  Italy works like say. symptoms, doctor asks tampon. I'm waiting results, consider positive behave likewise, home isolation included. transgress, pay fee (while risk going jail I'm officially positive leave home) (this may quality test... *did* set up.. ) Cases saw bump June that’s entirely due expanded testing. metrics falling since April. 

ICU: Good doing. way beat build antibodies. things spike slow themselves. im using reddit tool prevent this. math stands, decrease saw week increased prevention, masks CA's closures. AZ's closures assist soon hope, another week hope peak. can't predict happen states decide respond. **I predict they'll need respond by.** really hope do, I'd love come back next week report longer pace reach this. assure you, root calamity. I'm posting later ""right"". I'm already right, headed there. hope stop heading there, take political action. 

Edit:

!Remind 17 days 

We talk then. rise predicted happen increasing daily cases.

It sustained gain absolutely examining it’s going well.

Bullshit. running around place claiming things going up. forced look data ***numerous times*** finally changed tune say 60% increase deaths three weeks big deal, still dumb hell.

You need education dude. sad. English primary language would correct taking compliment. better lot people know speak English. would absolutely pay grand covid vaccine. I'd continue rolling dice ive rolling last months costs much. I've responsible sake people Im personally afraid covid. 

Most young people would probably same. costs grand people think they're pretty healthy wont bother. nightmare. I'm going tell someone panic attack feel like can't breath put mask back on. feelings anxiety claustrophobia real. never said face shield better mask better nothing all. called compromise. 

And going say can't handle mask go well that's stupid argument anti-maks people say tell people afraid virus go out. stop trying divide people try find ways accommodate many people still working towards getting everyone safer. legit argument someone could wearing face shield alternative mask. I’m trying doom gloom... wondering that’s possibility. it’s sketch Costello explaining landlord much rent Congrats minority moron state then. fight employers, they'll get fired.  Hong Kong experienced similar effect Jan/Feb 2020. ‘missed‘ flu season due masks distancing. 

Given American practices far, hopeful ‘our’ prospects. 156 subjects, difference would useful predictive purposes. Chemo radiation affect one's immune general functioning. ask goes caused death slash covid. obviously related covid doesnt take genius figure out. get argument point, functionally US makes sense law like would reflect that.

The covid response laying bare everyone always decent jobs benefits like PTO sick leave large portion country operates *normally*. 

Hopefully wakes people inadequacies US labor market. living small 2 bedroom apartment. One male two, well were..... 14 people. Reefers  Pretty bad understatemebt. would go something like ""horrific"" that. FWIW, I'm advocating putting people actually sick hotels like this. People may exposed awaiting results, travellers inbound hot spots. 

I certainly think people symptomatic left hotel devices one care them, especially family members willing accept risk caring them.

But subsidized facilitied people quarantine without risking exposing family members essential. I'm trying extract someone love FL right now, biggest barrier encountering figuring somewhere quarantine without endangering anyone else - especially considering hotel rates appearing jacked 25% since time... think anything glory hole safe lol  Oklahoma Employment Security Commission staff tried combat delays holding mega-processing events large arenas Oklahoma City Tulsa month, masks social distancing required. far, they’ve managed help 6,200 unemployment claim approved March stalled, problem hadn’t fixed nine phone calls hours hold OESC. How’s America virus Bruh even know u even talking about. see ""probably"" ""maybe"" that. love everyone. mean, US deaths Canada total cases. think second wave going worse? kidding hacked. hacked people want use make money prestige, and, yes, private data super valuable.

For example, country wanted smear vaccine's reputation boost public opinion own, going trial candidates pretty easy. And, yes, that's already happened.

Btw, sharing anonymous data done- called publishing.

You really need brush scientific progresses seem slim understanding it.  Normally I'd say forcibly vaccinate them, suspect early vaccines might still risks. Less dangerous getting COVID, still.  I've thought literal visibility, too. is, one seeing sick people. handful videos documenting experience, people actually forced confront it. US government made agreement Pfizer buy vaccine sell free. matter want right thing not, made agreement stick it. bullshit. money went wall street. Unemployment benefits increased want take away.  Guess humans dumb selfish ass-wipes !! Rice beans spice oil flour bud. oxford one seems closest. honestly think would use Chinese one all. someone full throated vaccine advocate I'd hesitant China quality controls like free covid tests.... Hey, living 16 roommates. Poverty doesn’t exactly give room quarantine weeks. Food costs money. It’s sad government isn’t giving people like attention could combat problem making things like quarantine hotels, etc. /: Per day? Per week? getting numbers?  Someone know usually pretty discerning claiming friend received negative result got letter CDC saying tested positive.

people saying version story months now. 

It's conspiracy theorists making sense huge number new cases everyday, otherwise they'd accept US failed nation. Yeah China pay us back anyways one way other. Enjoy! sounds like need rewrite form. would wrong cause someone hesitate delay calling 911 ambulance, emergency. 

I hope make people who've tested positive sign form like county - think do. tracking daily case reports months now. We've gone 10% tests taking week get results June 35-50% tests taking week get results.

We likely ~100,000 queue processing. Sonora Quest alone reporting 62k. hahaha oops. live major hot spot city got results 1 business day (tested Friday got Monday morning). also went doctor. Garbage. security guards let out, there'd cases. Successful quarantine much ask. little percentage thing garbage too. Currently many something virus give. huge number things shouldn't. 90%. wait virus pass on. could follow simple rules, infections per day near zero. Instead, doubling every two weeks less. People Melbourne poor job following simple rules. competent government would anticipate though make rules laws punishments raise compliance. 

Go ask Kiwis actually job well. Go ask Americans half arsing it. Keep mind lot people work may able afford flu shot year also, still significant number people refuse wear mask. lot people avoid going get flu shot year avoid getting C19 clinics well.

Masks going help counterbalance extent main linchpin schools. Schools epicenter lot community spread illnesses. 500+ kids 500+ homes interacting 7+ hours day. go home wear mask around parents. parents catch take office. Colleagues catch take home family goes different school on... Masks absolutely help year could honestly incredibly devastating year flu top everything people getting vaccinated schools still open unable properly social distance 7 hour day, 5 days week. mode operation well. assume everyone people did. least chemistry research experience there's several stage peer review process publication...

Bio might different still.. can't find any? Actually, lot pressure businesses exempted. wave started, American airlines cancelled route city citing concerns quarantined... Sounds like people claiming US would never hit 10,000 deaths back April.. changed claim saying absolutely way US hit 100k deaths hit 10,000 deaths.

We could absolutely hit 100k cases day, could probably already testing cluster fuck odds able hit confirmed numbers could slim based alone.

Edit: saying you’re wrong.. saying possible. don’t think we’ll seeing 100k day, 65-70k day fucked metric accept. true anywhere though. might not. Many fight tooth nail antivax fun watch. Good news really need every one need enough idiots can't spread other. part people participate stay risk get sick that's really natural selection. I'm 10 yrs old maybe Funny mention Abbott, project validated water system install used produce PCR test kits provide results 15 minutes. 

We right middle yearlong project needs completed 2 months, might even bypass full performance qualification early sampling demonstrates systems meet exceed standard. Starting become clear testing capacity becoming strained right now. can't ...wrap head around it...

...I ....wow. Less 50% Americans net tax payers.

And people less 2% net wealth United States, I'd say pretty close government isn’t efficiently spending money get.

I agree. gave military military asked for. [We spend defense next many countries cut government check $10k 60k salary last week. It’s choice children make choice spouse ones footing bill. Full stop!

Again, believe this, mean that, society, let children suffer decisions parents. abhorrent *and* hurts us long run. Again, hungry students can't learn, tough succeed without education. suggestion exacerbate problem.

This issue studied *extensively*. want fix issues, give people access food, healthcare (including contraception), education. choose fewer children. get tested? girlfriend took advantage CVS free drive-thru self swab test. day 4 waiting (which awful contrasted world stage, thanks America) wondering (or where, rather) y’all’s experience was?

Thanks! Dallas wild right now. Stay strong. people still trying hard part. included. already are. asshole yell ""that mask wont protect fatty!"" day. fuck assholes San Jose: got tested yesterday (Verily Baseline), promised result within 2 days. Testing drive-thru wait, whole thing took maybe 10 minutes. Two weeks ago FL 223k infections 3,890 deaths.

Today it’s 369k infections 5,319 deaths.

That’s drastic, cases daily deaths rise. course, probably work, Pfizer still make billions process. definitely paying taxes. honestly medicine paid for.  lot people using 'work made it' excuse punch fellow man didnt like call out.

Ive also gotten massive downvote trains pointing many people use mindless consumption soothe pain poor traps poverty.

People think Im coming priviledge Ive poor people refuse take personal responsibility situation ones dangerous everyone else. case point: story

Also everyone making strawman shes street 11 kids instead forced wear mask socially distance maybe go hotel 2 weeks.  even ideal solution temporary. Quarantine whole country tight lockdown 3 months get? Corpses old people tetanus victims gangrene cases rotting farmhouses absolute apocalypse cities.

How expect somebody living 4th floor building live like suggest? yank cavities pliers? keeps utilities running? drains clog? fridge breaks? fires? Gas leaks? Cancer? Heart attacks &amp; strokes? Insulin? Oxygen need it? Seizure medicine? Blood pressure medicine? Pregnancies infant care? Trash removal? Roof repairs? Dog food? 

Multiply stuff 7 billion see problem. 

Even could work, can't, would work vaccine rolled worldwide. Otherwise comes back vengeance end quarantine. Unless get whole entire world wear hazmat suits entire time? 

What suggesting magical thinking. Might well invoke wizards unicorns.

Edit: took original commenter replying continuing argument. maybe still works given said. moved California Midwest. cheap! cost everything had, give vast majority possessions, family stay ended four months. people poor enough live 15 people can't afford it. Also, Midwest much cheaper rent, things stores little cheaper, jobs!!! jobs pop occasionally paid nothing got laid less year often not. CA, can't turn around without job offer. Pay amazing, get benefits, actually able buy house eventually turned TWICE one cheapest places live country. parks nice schools great, tons stuff time, people smile here, great.

So, anyway, telling poor people move cheap places solving anything. one 1/3 trial patients adverse side effects? never disputing that. admitted immediately going lead infections deaths first reply. disputing going create lot orphans. I'm schools reopening, even teachers health. Sounds like people fine fact writing comment means OK also. Everyone OK. 

This entire thread bunch wimps. Get sick, get it. Bunch mask wearing wusssies talking shit ""Americans"" Americans. I'm really not! want people wake close calamity, help us apply brakes! pretty happy saw 3 day delay last post. think little bit math literacy issue... 10 day delay cases peak, growing exponentially, can't wait close ""unacceptable"" hit brakes. Oof. therapist? think benefit mental health professionals time. basically US treated immigration generations, then. 

Whoops, forgot /s. Vietnamese people regularly wore masks anyway, sure ""even"" meant imply. think accomplishing comment? from, make self isolate get results. Also absurdly densely populated. yes, bad long time. point trying make? ""Fucking finally"" terrifying honestly. entire hometown straight religiously believes hoax bring Trump. We're 40 people short today (I work ATL) 25 year old coworker came today, said chest hurt bad like heartburn pressure, left. another coworker month ago say ""summer cold"" 2 weeks. coughing like hell working every single day. seen while. neither public, mean see youth lays middle highway. teaches false teachings. education illusion system get tax breaks using children. realize learn everything free online right. even taught. response failed education system. put pay education learn free online lives. cannot see that, prove point cannot understand words. I’ve heard 10x headline since March, would’ve expected ratio change least little bit testing ramped up. tough justify able eat outside millions people outside protesting What? 13days?! 1-2 day Thailand taste vip like ambassadors special officers arrived airport super fast taste, like 2 hours. Wtf 13 days. many people getting taste what?! Testing also plateaued. 

3.6 roentgens... people acting like they're going die wearing mask 30min grocery shopping trip meanwhile retail workers food service workers wear masks 8 hours every day fine.  Also watch Jose Aldo.

&amp;#x200B;

...I'll show out. Choosing 16 people 1480 square-foot house California lifestyle choice.

Many could moved midwest. Lets gooooooooooo There's lot focus Sweden model anti-lockdown crowd; many times post Sweden well, badly lockdown nation gets posted one lockdown skeptic subs brigaded. there's lot defenders Swedish strategy downvote every single thing post.  Yeah, people seem understand. Yes, kids learn much schools closed. necessarily teachers working virtual learning general never works. mom got week prepare. could submit one grade per week grades even matter ended using previous grading period grades. kids never log work, that's teacher. individual basis, Covid doesn’t high chance killing anyone. It’s many millions people getting it, you’re bound get deaths too. True. We’re pretty high demand. There’s couple labs area aggressively recruiting. Who'dve thought humans inherently bad/selfish Anecdotal testing site near Miami seems drawing smaller crowds last week so. traffic generated used last day tends Peter late morning/early afternoon. lol luxuries, necessities There's lot assholes idiots come here. stopped paying attention awhile ago dumb motherfuckers (as Samuel L. Jackson would say). Plus, government *wanted* go moon still site rules, though. outsourced gov/mil charge scared ever since executed people charge botched vaccine like 5 years ago something people line work probably quintuple check everything. 

nothing ever happens pharma exec states id afraid skipped important test said F\*\*\* let's make money. 

quality pay china, get iphone quality get low quality, really depends. Dollar general orders bunch knicknacks sure going cheapest thing world like customer ordered. Presidents class mind intact. old shit running presidency like dumbass. miss days controversial thing president born, morons complaining that. clueless idiot work something similar this. Yes, man literally wrote book dealing crap like selflessly served nation decades lying everybody.

The man suited went treat ebola patient absolutely going ask team something willing do, lying everybody.

There never refrigerator trucks.

My friend nurse New York watch dozen patients die front her.

The entire world conspiracy. Literally every person died around world specifically fuck United States want to.......what? Wear fucking mask couple months go out?

Gotta fight man. Gotta fight government control. Except exactly type sitting back jacking sight military uniformed unmarked police grabbing people streets disappearing without announcing are. Wearing mask public short period time protect others fascism, literal secret police kidnapping people streets without announcing perfectly acceptable.

Must fight system. Except government issued driver's license ID card identifies government.

Nobody tell body wear. Except right go store dick waving around.

You accuse lacking critical thinking yet getting information anonymous people Internet absolutely proof anything credentials whatsoever. getting news media somewhere. getting friends I'm going guess absolutely 0 medical degrees experience. maybe getting guy specific vested interest lying everything going on. And, ironically, head government hell bent proving lying everybody everybody dying world.

But easy way prove wrong. Go one hospitals designated covid patients. Tell believe going would like expose ""virus"" think hoax. Go rooms tell every single one people lying faking perpetuating government control. let ask people going cough couple days prove whole entire thing hoax get sick.

But I'm gonna guess even going think moving ass chair go actually see refrigerator trucks see people dying.

I critical thought questioning authority figures questioning stories media outlet gives agendas, ignorance, interests certain stories making money. entire world conspiracy United States. unbelievable amount arrogance think country center entire universe degree everybody else world would gather together specifically kill populace mess us. since believe people dying, every country world locked willing sacrifice economy year plus however long going take recover fuck United States.

Try thinking one critically.

But course could here. want guy say it, but... DUH severely underestimating leaders willing keep economy moving. Agreed seeing spikes. Risk managed raging firestorm. we're talking difference knowing whether someone infected knowing someone infected possibility false positives/false negatives. can't wait everybody starts say masks ineffective also racist this. current stats 2020 Australia year bad year. Even got first time ever.

This year..

Incredible! phantom thieves! potentially spreading virus countless people contract it. might care die also apparently don’t care kill others. That’s entire issue thing. 

My grandma said thing “I’ve lived long enough don’t really care takes me” basically told ok won’t seeing new born great grandchild you’re dead. *so think ~~front like workers~~ highest bidder lockdown spiking? like people WANT worse is. interesting learned better treat virus? seems like pretty fucking obvious result longer completely unknown us. 

I think interesting still seem think bad when, again, third deadliest thing America Dude, Chinese-American, fucking racist piece shit. Stop calling China virus. originated give fucking rights smear China.

And stop blaming China, fucktwat. US government incompetent administration give rat's ass virus let spread, virtually every country competent leadership managed slow spread, wanna keep blaming China instead Trump.

I'm tired *your* bullshit, moron legal crime Testing occurred resources test?  anyone really confused though? proven egotist, self proclaimed info wars listener OANN fan? fits bill entitled narcissistic sees using mask inconvenience thus intolerable violation rights. We're sinking re-election chances would still opposed masks day. understand saying I'm confusing argument attempted herd immunity justification argument would insist subtracting percentages covid-19 deaths form justification would unacceptable metric.  Jesus, dead come back Yes agree good education important, guess depends school whether good virtual program hers, least hers.

Sweden 5,000 corona deaths. autumn, may Norway gets stung, says Sweden's state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell.


In Sweden, trust authorities. trust judgment "", wrote Gina Gustafsson comment Dagens Nyheter summer. political scientist commentator believes Swedish government much trust people.

- recently yesterday came news Swedes infected corona call around contact with. trust people lot, Gustavsson says Aftenposten.

She believes Swedish government large extent left infection control measures inhabitants - infection tracing - could introduced stricter restrictions. High trust inhabitants may one reasons coronavirus struck hard Sweden, commentator believes.

Swedes receive confirmation infected coronavirus future much greater extent track contact with, reports news agency TT.
Previously, Swedish patients exceptionally assist detection infection, corona infected given much responsibility.

#Tough autumn Norway?

Sweden far infected dead Norway. Yesterday, number risen 5,646 corona-related deaths Sweden, 255 deaths Norway.

In autumn, situation could reversed countries get new wave infections, according Sweden's state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, according Omni.

- think get away easier get increased number cases Sweden Norway autumn, said press conference Tuesday afternoon.

Tegnell pointed number people immune play important role second wave, Sweden people immune Norway has.
If ill covid-19, risk re-infected zero, according Tegnell.

- see people become ill twice covid-19.

#Adapted average Swede

Gustafsson Dagens Nyheter critical authorities communicated population corona crisis.

- main message ""do panic"", says Gustavsson explains.

Doctors said could wear face masks, want create fear. said thing face masks nursing homes: Let's scare necessary, says.

People would followed infection control considerations stricter, says editorial writer Svenska Dagbladet, Fredrik Hultman.

""I think authorities could introduced stricter rules, introducing quarantine people returned travel from, example, China Italy,"" Hultman told Aftenposten.
Hultman points people, all, obeyed authorities' advice well so.

- government banned gatherings 500 people, seen, example, events 2- 300 people also canceled.

In addition, points travel Stockholm Gotland decreased 90 percent Easter weekend compared period last year.

- Many chose limit travel, opportunity so, worked home even though required, says.

Löfven said early would give people bans injunctions. requires people march time without anyone standing behind saying required law, says Hilde Sandvik Aftenposten.

She host radio program «Norwegian, Swedish Danish».

Sandvik thinks part reason Swedes hit hard corona strategy adapted average Swede.

- seen much infection occurred areas high immigration greater poverty, says.

A review infected dead sorted postal code Sweden showed poor districts hit far harder corona pandemic rich districts.


- authorities know areas high immigrant density, poor language skills, people necessarily read Swedish media, says Fredrik Hultman.


Gustavsson's refusal introduce strict measures explained great need freedom, Gustavsson believes.


""Sweden Pippi pandemic, Prussiluskan"" title comment Dagens Nyheter earlier year. Prussiluskan character tries get Pippi orphanage. Gustavsson believe Swedes anarchist capitalists. contrary.


- mercy loved ones downsizing requires. government institutions schools, jobs retirement life close, must home loved ones. living violent poor homes, lockdown critical.


Gustavsson compares state institutions Pippi's money bag.


- one gives us opportunity fully, without taking much consideration others, says.  Thanks, way little late. 

All narcissists neanderthals refusing wear them, misguided ""muh rights"" complaint going continue wear them.

I'm Ohio, obstinate state country refuses wear them, playing fire. Governor wants everyone wear one, turns around vetoes enforcement bill really telling inept state federal government dealing this. 

I hate weak presidents, states scapegoat ineptness point fingers federal government gets point. 

It's going get worse. 3500 people dead Ohio since started, now.

Too little, late. going spread even worse, still first wave. Well conversation Geneva. couldn’t compare California. Geneva actually great comparison San Francisco. cities investment groups gobbling real estate. Yes isn’t leader’s rules? come wish death thousands actually act upon it? see stories like everday yet people think whole pandemic somehow Trumps fault. People idiots. Hospitals actually laying people enough non-Covid patients. Almost hospitals across country overrun.

Edit: believe google ""hospital definitely won’t attitude. It’s like there’s third option, need get people’s heads June 6.22 ban foreign nationals seeking entry H, J, L visas. move r/immigration info. said ""US hits 4,000,000 coronavirus cases"".  people contracted recovered virus long ago may longer detectable antibodies! (I'm saying ppl lost immunity.)  Segregated testing sites working healthcare definitely mandatory State performing on-site testing. also think several fields on-site testing would impossible. 

My State currently performing weekly tests working residing within facilities COVID present. Rapid testing appears reserved facilities impacted regional outbreaks, though general public typically receives testing within 24hrs request results reported within 48-72hrs. region recently seen significant increase infections? 

Were return work awaiting results? We've sending PUIs presumptives home either negative results verified they've properly self-quarantined. I'm Texas I'm working throughout heavily impacted cities towns without single case, testing pretty consistent. military asked hit performed initial testing. imagine many patients attacked stated lol. Like welcome world. 

On serious note, safe stay well. must demand additional vacation something. Due disability allocated week literally slept ~16hrs/day. Working autopilot pretty rough couple months.  That's assuming one dose vaccine, lot vaccines aren't. Influenza 2 doses given first time children, that's vaccine we've honing decades (with obvious seasonal changes antigenic drift). [A ton vaccines require multiple doses given couple months 3+ dose vaccine like HIB, S. Pneumo, Rota etc, means 1/10th less population could git it. becomes lot less protective society whole.  might two working parent household right one gets sick kids brought illness home? much hospital bill gonna cost you? realize may realistic alternative one stay home financial situation may require incomes provide food shelter family. thats case, exceptionally vigilant avoiding bringing virus home, you, partner children, fail so, may come find never really say many people working household. Yes, totally sounds like person find new job afford move across country... happy Florida noises entail? put 5 minutes work in, find house Zillow. 1620 square feet 6 bedrooms 2 baths, rent estimated $2250 month. Literally communist propaganda. Look post history Give experiment time. Communicate performance drop let employees adjust behavior. Either people bored jobs disengaged, replace productive home office, good performers taking much needed break given life year, back usual output better. punish everyone making drag back office. people may people quit, really notice productivity decrease. Similar work place, America. work university, I'm paid well they're taking seriously, pretty fair employees. What's point? America still mostly poor, wealth concentrated certain people certain economic classes.

Mississippians could go broke unexpected medical bill. UK social systems place preventing that. curious: reduced testing almost half days ago. Remember 100k tests per day? would would seeing record numbers right now. 
the deaths record high reflects that.

""slow testing down"" DeSantis obliges. Bolsonaro joga bonito kkkkkkkk 🏆⚽ thankful don’t live bureaucratic hell-hole [universal healthcare mean, people willing ignore/accept mounting death toll ""life goes on"" elected morons right.

And based Florida/Texas/Arizona are. honest everyone thinks area schools shit show reading comments schools guess seem along least trying figure solutions ""open 'em up"" ""close 'em down"". think biggest frustration us parents they've 6 months think plan month school would normally starting. biggest issue politics getting involved place shouldn't. 

Our school district small live rural area. question 200 webcams zoom subscription could virtual classes running seem even considered right now. problem parents can't stay home kids keep video 8hrs internet access. Although school district 15 miles away provides students sufficient internet mobile hot spots solved issue.

I think lot good options right hate solution think better. 

-outdoor classes weather campus permitting. would love see schools use parks town outdoor classrooms much possible getting either drop walk kids.

-shorten teaching day essentially classroom time teaching lesson actually homework. could morning afternoon would open school study hall one one help child care parents work. difference could better spread students using empty gyms cafeteria's

these 2 ideas think work smaller school district. think primary goal make people FEEL safe solution going make 100% safe least show people trying trying best legitimize fears taken seriously feel better sending kids school working school. thought getting paid sick required government, seeing many people share stories topic. take back also linked posting Facebook God's gift earth wear mask every time go left house anything groceries since March? know annoys me? People want gyms open cite Norwegian study showed proper precautions hygiene gym virus small chance transmitted. study couple serious flaws: city study conducted cases Covid-19 course study, low likelihood someone infected would come contact group testing first place. Furthermore, none people tested virus course study. Fucks sake Karen god, poor boys. worry cousin Texas, he's single father 5 year old daughter. happening. making similar mistake. America country that's done really poorly. countries much choice resources also governments refuse even minimum Brazil Nicaragua. stayed home . . . infected 15 housemates?

She needed put hotel tested positive. Yes.

We also healthcare tied employment Western Europe changed now. employer still pays healthcare unemployed still get treatment.

I believe Hungary outlier working three months kicks free healthcare system. mean, eradicate disease effective vaccine universal vaccination (assuming common animal vector). super difficult though accomplished smallpox rinderpest, believe. age too. I’m early 30s late 60s. bothers much.

My parents retired looking get new job make extra cash boom. shit hit.

Good luck family. Hope stay safe. Disgraceful leadership Washington. deserve full punishment law allows genocide. Hey check out, communist Chinese spies reddit! America Last 40% believe Earth 6,000 yrs old? surprising least. Yeah, agree you. trying show really winning even public officials taking proper precautions. could worded little bit better though. initially one worst states start major outbreaks Philly area, one first shut downs county county, one first ""mandate"" mask wearing, actions took us one worst infected states top five least cases people still finding something cry about. seriously idea politicians please people :( SOCIALIST  lifestyle choice. living part country 1600 square foot house rents $2200 month. Where? suspect even absence proper government intervention, critical mass people tend respond rapid increase cases modifying behavior, either staying home wearing masks, etc. 

Not enough solve crisis, enough cases aren’t going increase exponentially indefinitely. much hype around vaccine candidates, maintaining cautious optimism slow economic restart first month two 2021. really seems virus demonstrating vulnerable modern capitalism is. Without vaccine horizon would *very* different place. hope make winter ok. Venting here. talking guy legitimate medical issue hearing time he's anti-masker, he's using medical issue excuse. say excuse brought refusing shop Walmart, mask policy mind going different directions.

One less person supporting Walmart multitude shitty practices great, never cared anything else before, like treat employees, proving people like give shit affects them.

Not mention, know anyone else, try talk anyone go Walmart store. Plus, even absolutely to, always there's apps (one know fact already phone) translate people saying even mask on.

I know I'm going this. I'm tired selfishness needing seen ""different"" ""special"". special wanting wear mask, shopping Walmart Starbucks, need money anyway. trying hard ""special"". looking C# developers? Honest question. well aware. focusing trying educate them.

Or least, make sure every time spit another lie, real information pointing incompetence. company worth salt undergoing stress test scenarios happens person x gets sick. people x, y, z. companies run lean enough doesn’t take many people getting sick work start impacting critical functions. 

If company withstand 20% outage rate 3 weeks (seems average “mildly” sick cv) , probably staffed. 

I wonder lot industries don’t take business continuity disaster recovery seriously should. don’t work traditionally critical infrastructure organization, management may get it. totally agreed realized premise China rogue nation. got me. powers deduction wasted reddit. need take gifts Scotland Yard appreciated. Keep good work, Columbo. would one crazy person they'd call police on. employees would physically remove confront you, would advisable.

If 80% shoppers coming store insist naked absolutely leave peacefully, there's really nothing store do. One way look (which think widely reported) ""excess deaths"" i.e. deaths statistically average. would account things like whether someone going die anyway deaths indirectly caused virus.

[Based CDC significant number end March middle June, deaths since returned average. know someone waiting 16 days results. could live different part country. someone fly month get work, hear you. Thankfully I'm Europe dealing qhite level idiocy USA. Id much much rather fly though already cut hours much barely pay rent keep contingency money. Now's great time looking new job locally either. everyone flying wants there. think people flight last week would rather home loved ones. spot dickheads still travelling mile though [Came pretty close Smallpox well.

The common thread diseases less eradicated global effort took decades. Based overall US response covid, really think there's intel would worth stealing. need new Smartphone I'm gonna using top tier battery life (charger never hour away me. I'm using cellular data much I'm commuting traveling (which i'm days) lot *them* particularly well off.

They've voting politicians act directly interests while, cognitive dissonance well-oiled machine point, scapegoats ideology. I'm saying right correct. saying understand actions took government effortlessly failed every poor American. 

I'm confused mean ""I'm punching down"", person punching down. right poverty makes incredibly drastic dangerous things times. Maybe address actual issue plaguing society instead laying responsibility onto literally struggling survive provide families. 

Poverty large issue driving spread. say ""been poor"" means longer. assure poverty felt past poverty people experiencing today midst largest global health crisis lives.

Can pay rent next month? people able could get eviction papers end month. rent added next month making double. 

I agree personal responsibility essential. wear masks, sanitize, worked entire time. cold took two weeks even though unable get tested. went without food days it. children probably would've worked. Also work allowed take time call days. Many places work extend gratitude. 

I'm standing I'm saying too. Poverty governments inability provide us real monster here. not. putting people's lives risk, despite whatever precautions take. acceptable. Also interesting article concludes fatality rate measured IFR (infection fatality rate, different case fatality rate) 0.68%. way, way lower fatality rate reported, example 8-10% areas. disagreeing. People gathering frequently greater groups Wal Mart, Lowe’s Home Depot back April. starkest, wild change mass protests. didn’t bring once, you? Excuse I’m little pissed event based business still forcibly shut rioters protesters celebrated rooted for. 

You’re wrong. hypocrite. Accept it.   ensuring safe production testing vaccine used half billion people also considered saving lives?? problem making profit, problem making slightly larger profit expense millions people forced take vaccine could potentially cause numerous health risks deadly complications cut corners make money. incontrovertible fact already done past capable again. I'm pointing careful produce vaccine. 

I never said make it, people never take it. I'm simply saying extra amount caution oversight ensure safety applied. amazing much negative response trying apply tiny bit common sense. wow.. wow. know malicious stupidity.. simply bread winner afford miss work due lack social safety net. Disclaimer: read article. co-worker claims afford work since get paid commission only...the guy literally quit take huge paycut sucks sales anyway. one good week, made 1500 week decided quit. openly admitted next Monday symptoms feels like shit can't afford miss work. Anyway, manager decided it'd great idea us come in, time trying make office social distancing friendly....ends kid still came work...infected people sitting next him....my friend got sickness said girls company shut 2 weeks exposed. clearly work home, manager persistent us come in....now sent home again, office infected......The selfishness people fucking ridiculous. original person infected African-American, refused wear mask, along African-Americans worked ( also wear mask) ... called racist asked wear masks said coronavirus effects everyone.....long story short office got infected....our sales went drastically manager could prevented following regular protocols. manager believes coronavirus hoax....also got sick. Wear masks please. care race coronavirus effects EVERYONE. Educate stop watching media. Wear mask please. Modern capitalism reason vaccine horizon like right now. It’s reason US, UK, Germany forefront vaccine race. Meanwhile countries like China trying steal vaccine tech. think many pharm companies funzies? Smart! best thing anyone assume it, conduct accordingly  many sources there. grabbed one. google “long-term effects COVID-19” you’ll find many many stories. Unless don’t want believe them. disease eight months old, I’m sure you’re looking for. wish knew hell going there. total mystery me. claim done tests countries South Central America, see how, healthcare system known total disarray. say 4 deaths per million...best S. America, again, seems impossible. blame foreigners returning refugees, outbreaks among party leaders. one contradiction another. It’s less we’re poor it’s expensive live there’s little way social safety net. Lil bit Sudafed nose British English too, least Middle england. lived cul-de-sac 13, personally. governments job keep citizens safe. Federal government failed spectacularly. Donald Trump cares one thing only: Donald Trump. care anyone else.   Ugh, Tegnell worst. really absurd suggest Norway somehow get harder Sweden fall point really. Norway probably single strongest argument world Test, Trace, Isolate works well: shares long border Sweden, EU country (sans microstates) *currently* hit hardest, holding dubious title time now. Norway's cases, deaths, etc. remain low despite long, unpatrollable border reports Swedes sneaking and/or coming legitimately work purposes found infected. 

Björn Olsen, prominent Swedish epidemiologist many *wish* Tegnell's position said [""unthinkable"" Nordics catch Sweden terms death 

Frode Forland, Norway's state epidemiologist, also called [Tegnell lacking (Archive link: http://archive.vn/gpEJq) 

It's ridiculous suggest Norway worse fall. Esp. simply know immunity works growing number [credible reports potential seems like everyone knows someone affected What? mean price, says going free, going given based government discretion, probably given people actually need most, like frontline workers, vulnerable. really saddest part. Immediately initially donned mask days back whatever, co-worker said thing eachother: ""how long claims he's always masks?"" Next day mom called said thing. predictable matter ""when"" ""if"". 

""People say beautiful mask.. tremendous.. etc. etc."" Cause support it? There’s many nuanced conversations can’t get reddit unnecessary requirements explain incredibly basic shit. 

You know I'm talking about, choose act like idiot chance *feel* like ""won"". 

Thanks nothing conversation. Oooh noooo good news.\^ give fuck because?  dad told small town grocery store goes maskless, proud it. People dumb. Someone unimaginable massive conflict interest. Someone stand make millions stock profit optimism company. Australia's treatment non white people far appalling long-lasting. Scott could done something long time ago, hasn't. Evidence shows outdoor protests high mask usage lower risk activity many non-essential things people do. true Minnesota would bad Florida right now... I'm glad someone guts state obvious.  definitely see % positive metric increase testing maxes out, obvious symptoms receive first tests Yeah American got bored social distancing measures. haven’t flown since beginning March, attitude making strongly consider swapping insignificant amount work travel Delta over. UA gives enough fucks keep shareholders happy more. article mentions measuring live births. really mention saw higher miscarriages prior measures months. Yeah, like could one person get big shop everyone one person helping teaching babysitting, etc, etc, stopped giggling number 69 much. Horrible analogy vaccines already manufactured alongside final trials, put market pass tests. Oxford vaccine expects 100,000,000 vaccines available UK fall, 300 million next 6 months manufacturing. Good chance companies start churning similar time frame.

Of course, vaccine fails final trials, manufactured doses dumped. Anyone Florida now, seeing virus close personal impact people’s political stance? confirm. Worked restaurants major priced coffee joint. heavy punishments coming work sick. come sick someone serving complains go home. still came back next shift sick not. needed help everyone failed her. supposed feed depended her? Also, 'known infections.' NYC overrun anyone knew going testing. Bible says go forth multiply. Infection rate outpacing ability test, backlog growing, number tests able done day constant.

What information reported article, states ""for almost month, number people admitted Orange County hospitals weekly went up, last seven days, number patients seeking care COVID-19 decreased significantly""? movie two many narrators. thinking use somebody steals identity empties bank account. stupid question answer yes. Well, reports corona last year... Coronasonaro SARS (and probably MERS too) long term immunity thing. coronavirus similar common cold. can't refer one random strains coronavirus say ""see immunity pipe dream!"". That's works. Okay, we're changing ""shirts shoes required"" ""completely naked"", I'll go it. I'm guessing here, I've never situation, assume stores likely hypothetical bar naked shopper entering store call law enforcement backup needed.

&amp;#x200B;

But know there's uptick angry cases violent unmasked individuals trying enter stores/refusing leave stores asked. many, many armed, anti-mask rallies across country. individual get close enough physically pose barrier keep unmasked person shopping, risk infection. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe new normal, we're transitional period, hence upset. Maybe coming days weeks everyone come answer whose responsibility keep individuals masked situation requires it. roughly universal consensus like mostly ""shirts shoes required"". we're though, certainly fault business owner closing shop can't enforce mask wearing, fault worker refusing put life line battle belligerent, entitled, anti-masker. really go without saying someone anything based solely comments Reddit, regardless *anything* else? jumping point people know options. anyone else drill specific situation like official legal counsel ffs. Calling now:

“He bullshitting wearing masks four months troll libs!” it’s common real. Numbers get inflated election 3 months. Read article whiny little shit lol. Well, border US still closed, so... none? Well hospitalization fatality rates fallen time. visible look historical data per state.

For example Arizona, since May 1 cases increased 18x, hospitalizations 4x deaths 8x. lag data 10 weeks ago.

One explanation start test lot more, find people less severe illness. department labor done that.. ex even didn’t know cares act told him. imagine shit spigot's doctor..... suffer anxiety disorder, mask vs really change breathing.

Just get affected mean feel anxiety it. difficult realize that. saying panic attack real really trouble breathing telling feelings legitimate shitty thing do. fear discounting would panic attacks choose put risk wearing mask.

no i'm not, i'm trying find solution would compromise people anxiety wearing mask people anxiety people wearing mask. see face shield even effective Ask someone else go willing wear mask, simple that.

Ask someone else go get anxiety people wearing mask, simple that. See easy use phrase ways. get anxiety mask mean people not. unfair legitimize real fears. like suffer anxiety disorder tell ""quit bitching head"" see anxiety attack. would think reacting mean feeling legit feeling. shields Are. Not. A. Substitute. For. Masks.

No.Shit.I.Never.Said.They.Were Cases doesn’t equal infections. words mean different things. Company work for, company 100% remote since March plans time soon return work. couple people contract covid since home since march take much time need questions asked pay. required positive test.. 2 people try milk got let go Here's article local paper. 

[News think there's concern FDA seen giving political pressure, there's early Emergency Use Authorization, particularly EUA comes in, say, late October. That, writ large, recipe misery. getting deserve. probably best thing trump done, vaccinations government, probably go frontline workers, vulnerable. testing capacity hospitalizations though?  know says single use healthcare workers others reuse masks. wonder coating helps makes worse reuse somehow.. Liz pretty extreme herself. republicans it’s like different levels extremism get tested unless folks. exacerbate backlog situation get negative result, 2 weeks took mean time could contracted get tested again.

Also, I'm aware instances people caught C19 testing site absolutely exposing regardless.

Just wear mask, order groceries home trunk, eat go bars parties. know, sucks. wallet social life taken ding way gets better everyone works together end spread. death data available public degrading since May stopped getting regular numbers handful states. Meanwhile we’ve got tons deaths outside normal seasonally adjusted range things like pneumonia aren’t counted towards COVID death total. 

Who could seen combing hurricane Dorian? Well... took thing damn joke. people expect? seems like country initially pointed laughed, dismissing sense severity. part ensure perpetual casual sars outbreak forever. 

Ahh, 2020, year. 

The rest world looks us disgust, self absorbed realize world bigger warped perspective. maybe parents stop letting gov. teach kids look lead generations. kids go school distract, bully, prom, sports, true education would none that. hey way fool parents keep giving money one has. call system success, please. look around adults dont know basic health fighting mask. thats needs said. maybe many pay attention education part instead trying flaunt others. look around. see failure education. gov brought. mean look small town person school small dont mean shit. lack awareness, small towns state middle know also infected. people blind. effects say well thought since far away wont come here. oh wrong. VIRUS CARE RACE, DISTANCES, FARE LIVE ANYONE GETS PASSED AROUND CONTINUE SPREAD.  


lesson one today, stop spread pandemic, doesnt take college degree figure out. anyone pay attention class learn grade school. stop spread passing it. minds millions taught gov. gov portrays masses. people think control keep living allusion.  


in one truly understand words. due lack comprehension. youth adults would kill one another color. thats education. people would pay hundreds education learn free thing online.  


if cannot understand alone thats education system. blind even see that. proper setup I’m sure done almost risk free I'm glad friend followed protocol self-quarantining. People forget test required must assume infected. also remain isolation symptoms present due possibility false negative testing result. hope friend well suffering long term side effects. positive may want keep information medical records too. Coronaviruses multiple animal reservoirs, though. elimination unlikely. Feel like skilled trade unions still relevant, couple buddies construction make good money/benefits. already released phase 1/2 results.... It’s basically bleach sunlight right everyone get vaccine math right lol us don’t know government thinking either. yes, I’d even fucking walk hospital save money I’ve got shell 10k+ health insurance kicks in. better insurance last year, gambled year might get sick enough actually pay deductible 🤞🏼 Yeah definitely would never considered it, Americans generally averse changing leaders crisis *if* leader even reasonably okay job handling it. nipped thing bud back less normal life, masks contact tracing, May, would virtually guaranteed win November. he’s vile asshole, he’s stupid vile asshole well. would assume top priority test would people hospitalized covid symptoms. healthcare workers. even hazards guess would priority test. mean KKKaren. seems suggest throwing money people things gets done faster. 

I haven’t found true all. 

In fact, current model several independent teams working separately much better. never understood first place. Mask use must dropping young people. anyone know mask laws? expert opinion expect CEO Pfizer? connected steps process research approvals distribution. 1918 many classes held outside. astonishing considered schools now.

Absolutely tragic. virus like living nightmare yet leaders treat such. worthless comment. put shit back burner accept good news instead trying change tone? insane obsessed people are. Trump like guys wear helmets ride motorcycles. ""I crash"" fucking idiot that's people could crash you. It’s exactly shit like can’t rely people safety. 
1) general public educated spread disease enough understand don’t feel sick spread something. see time time kids school sick; people coming work sick day “they feel fine”. 
2) people care whatever want lack empathy don’t care. I've heard hotels give key, leave room can't get back in, get arrested. course, could tape door otherwise keep lock engaging, conjunction measures, incent people obey quarantine rules.

For example, temporary tattoo quarantine end date. [Some areas that.

I’ve heard many diff things regarding way spreads really don’t know believe keep mask on. possibility got asymptomatically brother gf, essential workers, get tests came back negative idk. 

Let know find article. inconvenient scary is, it’s interesting hell. We’re part huge moment history  Enough volts anything go away! Shocking isn’t it? :) 16 people household???? Wtf sounds like smart minority. 600 new cases 2 weeks

Just like, I'm sure true is, heard many people call ambulance potentially pay thousands trip, instead drive, fucked. We've made ambulance trips covered health care, someone needs ambulance, ambulance called without hesitation.

Ok I'm going tangent. Basically, government fucking stupid. shitshow understatement.

Thanks listening ted talk  Shut dick. went work, knowingly putting people risk. didn’t inform people lived ill, could worn PPE around increased hygiene controls. Instead selfish prick decided say ‘fuck you’ everyone else. Totally agree paid sick leave tho. 

You’re still dick.  hadn’t gotten significant numbers, lockdown, Florida opened early didn’t slow anything. cases exploded, deaths started pouring in, hospitals cried uncle, remdesivir ran low, plasma ran low.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* California literally covid positive sick patients imported straight state. people crossing state borders. yes. look deaths measure well things going. family members death count...Athens seems relevant. California locker way earlier case load implemented changes like masks weeks NY. Don’t try tell NY rocked whole damn thing. finally got control....California control tried open surged clamping again. mistake allowing wiggle room anyone. Give inch, take mile. Taking mask partially one WORST things people doing. spreads virus( it) anywhere body inside mask touches. Scratch neck hands everything else touch afterwards. masks period. 16 people household? Wtf? People like need arrested causing hazard. is, one would want lot bad press things wrong regarding pandemic. I've impressed response though far know, vitamin K helps prevent harmful calcium build vitamin helps store. seem synergistic calcium metabolism heard vitamin k deficiency causing vitamin deficiency. Also severe enough lack vitamin K would make prone bleeding, necessary clotting factors. Strokes heart attacks common people ill COVID get tested get treatment. cause blood clots major organs.

And hospitals capacity divert patients, cancel elective surgery discharge patients earlier normally would. relative might well die wouldn’t able forgive putting family danger like that.  all. PCR test rest world using gets 0.1% errors. US one poorly designed. That's work handling things. Really hard manage, really good employees. Lol made day. stealing data! isnt gone take make copy. can't tell many times see grocery store employee wearing mask incorrectly. put blame customers Karen stories bullshit

Curbside pickup sucks anyways. *exact* item want, SOL. Let's say store beef flavored ramen, I'll get chicken flavor I'm store. curbside pickup, getting ramen late, outbreak gone beyond control now. Crap. Vic handling appallingly. concept word lockdown. Scotland, number infection March 18. Similar populations. Even proper lockdown (everything shut - offices, factories, construction) managed put cap it. headed world hell. even sure story. Coronaviruses like common cold never go away. Tl;dr 
0.5 1% death rate parrot shit even understand pretend moral ethical. really frustrating! like shopper get 18 year old boy never grocery shopping life... half items order substituted refunded, random items order. delivery fee, service fee, tip... still go store get missing ingredients ""out stock"" (which right always hour said it.) happening Netherlands too. new cases started cafes. We've cases double last week opening restaurants, cafes gyms.

Edit: knew. Drunk people hey. 10$ says south Border. 
P.S. watched it. Ding, Ding, Ding, Winer Winer Chicken Dinner. test 80 000 per week. 8 per 1000 per week Well, think alluding potential long-term economic damage huge percentage unemployed Americans already tense time civil unrest. We’ve done pretty good job keeping stock market afloat, changes, goes hell fast. Nah, risk getting touching groceries almost non-existent. spreads air, surfaces. trust picture, based good research. LoL...fuck off. Thats pathetic. Sweden Denmark test exactly way. clearly never even close region. dont know talking about

Excess mortality way many factors..its completely irrelevant.

5000 deaths cant explained called slightly higher. girlfriend got tested traveling hasn’t received results two weeks. Positivity typically around 30% now. Agreed. ethically start punishing people bringing harm others like this, must first admit address fact society often leaves people without another option. 

There defense society easily afford provide people options avoid infecting other, yet inexplicable reason chooses to. paid sick leave, without positive test result - false negatives 20% rate joke, especially people employed small businesses even guaranteed paid sick leave. paying everyone told assume positive isolate await results, providing everyone need place isolate risk exposing others. need vaccinate every single person GREATLY reduce spread. 100 million, given right people, could basically make thing look like common cold. Nope, one we've known now. Especially poorer countries suffering lot.

Rich countries, think, get relatively close eradication there's political intent so.   part White House pre-election strategy. Misinformation lies. 

Start make virus sound less harmful - Check

Restrict limit amount information deaths state level - Check (in states)

Redirect data CDC HSS...aka White House control - Check

Try make Donald sound like everything stop virus - Check (last night shit show briefing) I'm failing recognize that. raised poor single parent. know struggles personal way. said, know well everyone financial situation keep kids home case, think school setting could ok, long everyone keep kids home, so, even means taking financial hit absorb. situation, social distancing becomes much possible. Nonetheless, people willing proactively take temporary financial hit, unfortunately, lot people, they'll forced take potentially permanent financial hit anyway get virus end hospital worse.

If better country, we'd talking paying people UBI keep kids home safe. really, Sweden's said mental well being"" =/= moderate severe depression.**

So quite apples apples comparison. Sometimes wish religious nutjobs would trust falls tallest buildings area since believe fully god's capacity divine intervention. really though....can imagine incessant preaching ""God's grace"" survive? I've pondering interesting ethical question. Say Person secretly wishes death people like, reflect actions (he still takes safety precautions covid). there's Person B, sends love prayers everyone, actively putting people lives danger attending house parties flouting mask rules. worse? lack information regarding younger children whether spread not.

Of course can. humans. admire optimism, hope right, really think fact K-12 kids spread lower rates countered fact K-12 kids *kids*, inherently unable adhere safety guidelines. think work many, sure, eventually, lot schools see infections flare within adult staff real pinch. Hard hodl classes half staff Covid. think severe symptoms. later stages disease now, think case going get serious would already point. becoming harder harder tell parody reality Pretty sure Trump would approve saline vials 'COVFEFE-19 vaxsine' written thought it'd help re-election chances.

Jail time. Now. 1m infected lead 100k deaths. far that. tested early epidemic, idea many infected were. Probably 10s millions. correct. number positive cases confirmed test 

The real number almost certainly even higher. Pay amazing, get benefits, actually able buy house eventually turned TWICE one cheapest places live country. parks nice schools great, tons stuff time, people smile here, great.

Sounds like lifestyle choice.

Good! make choice! 

But downsides choice, society cannot make downsides choice disappear. 

If place live really popular, going sort competition decide lives there, going drive prices.

If people make choice live place live 17 people 1480 square foot house, well, going live 17 people 1480 square foot house. understanding general process list actual cause death followed comorbid conditions likely contributed.

So done properly, would list kidney liver failure, followed recently positive covid diagnosis contributing factor. 

Is done everywhere time? Highly doubt it.

I always knew issues leadership. lately I've disappointed Texans complicity states massive fuck ups. fucking disappointing. Dawg you’re honestly likely get beat wearing trump hat see second person wearing trump hat San Jose 79 year old aunt ventilator. Found unresponsive assisted living, taken ER, tested COVID say. Came back negative. retest. pneumonia cannot expel CO2 lungs. vent. assume UCU takes precautions regardless test results. assume it. Sadly, he’ll probably take credit chadox1 vaccine. 

 Clinical trial probably involve half million units released America, roughly half placebo, election. He’ll get wrong say “he” made deal tens millions Americans get vaccinated hundred million way. 

Part wishes he’d kept antivax stance he’d home certainty November. We’re far vaccine. italy much higher increase sweden remained positive. charged manslaughter one die. Disgusting behaviour. ""Corona general"" made title though, ""state epidemiologist"" mask laws. But, society, cultural norm wear mask protect illness ill, anti-maskers noticeable scale.

The main issue young adults going socializing bars clubs without masks. students wear masks school activities (this protect students overheating PE, lunch such, kids whip mask walking home friends). 

The main issue tomorrow start four day national holiday Japan, start national tourism campaign 'Go Travel'. campaign, excluding Tokyo Tokyo residents, Japanese government pick part tab people travel within country summer holidays. lot people happy Japanese government choice launch campaign right now. Tests positive hospital? Lots former, much latter. Look test accuracy, btw. Italia test ""tampone"". understand 😅😅😅 say propaganda real. Clevons US believe anything media/facebook tells tell sheep! Amazing. amen sucks! test took 6 hours come back negative. [Yeah infected, 894 staff members 441 children. cases came 883 child care facilities open state, DHHS said.

What makes schools magical places virus transmit, run rampant child care facilities? 100 million dose 350 million people. 1/3 dose each. Yeah, get quite downvotes posts well. Seems like Sweden's kind topic makes folks walks life wanna hit blue arrow.  entirely irrelevant reply comment don’t know eaten indoors anywhere home since early March. 

And see changing time soon. 

Haven't gone single bar friends. 

I really miss important keeping others safe. Something keep mind virus spreads exponentially. mask 5% effective, ten doubling periods, could 4-5 weeks COVID, 40% overall fewer cases. 

If something reduce spread 20% around two months 20 doubling periods, would 99% fewer cases. 

The little things matter. part. Read article posted No, would I?

Lack rough estimates make one precise. Good thing hoax. Every top post ""VOTE"" specifically ""VOTE ELECTED OFFICIALS OUT"" literally every single one blame right now. president. Well Texas comparable population entire country Canada. keep things perspective. 3 couples 11 kids means basically 2 couples 4 kids 1 couple 3 kids.

Again, scientists predicting numbers going based current trends. site specific Texas. !Remind 17 days feel like going trend data. *no* clue absolutely unprecedented virus is, don’t think we’ll completely accurate number infections years control.

Personally think still early call second wave - we're seeing places get hit again, rather ever-expanding number places getting hit first time. like Florida got rid coronavirus back, they've increasing slowly entire time. Look one state's curve hard pressed find double peak. Yeah. amazing two linked  Well shit... testing capacity screw ups kept numbers Imagine broke split rent 16 people. 

No wonder go work.  Jokes aside Nothing free going paying higher taxes cover blank checks 

This technically true, kind silly thing say here. already spent $2 trillion CARES act, plus another $4 trillion using monetary policy.

That's 3000x spent vaccine. Even considering every investment made/will make vaccines cannot possibly get close spent economic relief.

Every penny spend vaccine research getting paid many times terms economic relief provides. April supposed go first trip outside U.S. visit old friend lives Japan. One friends said, “it good thing didn’t get go, might stranded there.” told him, “at point, sure would bad thing.” Compared Bakersfield Fresno, probably  1) exactly. there’s always going fewer jobs country city.

Quit obtuse  even read? I'm saying single player healthcare bad, I'm saying public option works perfectly fine many countries healthcare also amazing.. live one big cities Bay Area people see around taking seriously every little town I’ve driven (Lafayette, Pacifica etc) acting like everything normal.  fair Australian government recommending masks week ago, mandatory Melbourne.

I believe want encourage mask use sufficient supply healthcare workers, worried healthy people panic buying leaving none actually need them. coworker went Super Bowl work two weeks. She’s flying Colorado San Fran every weekend since November bragged it.. hence startling information. gobbles Fox News doesn’t help. go hospital Right pay 20k cure shit. Y? believe totally. don’t want live it. worldwide starvation. believe able achieve death dignity ready. peaceful death want help rest population survive. appalling returning refugees vilified Maduro. Ecuador, virtually every single Venezuelan met working send money home. Even now, find work trying support family back home. Remittances kept people starving. think Maduro hates refugees living proof reality can't admit. Typo title, 140 deaths (including 1 non-resident). Yeah there's almost never excuse wear one. I'm trying explain what's going psychologically little bit stupidity stubbornness.  🤞 Instead I'm still watching post bullshit masks causing fungal infections lungs dropping O2 levels. though masks new certain professions wearing full work shifts decades. Positive tests useless. allow contact tracers confirm COVID cause symptoms warn people original spreader may near infectious period. agree, though, tests benefit community individual, behind tests are. Also symptoms gotten bad dying, would admitted hospital whether knew COVID not. Italy 190 new cases yesterday, France 350, US 62,879. total lack leadership. make sense response dangerous global pandemic change critical things like specifically pandemic. Bolsonaro start recommending masks 3, 2, 1... Yeah, spent weeks worth food tent. I'm pretty shocked someone assuming wealth inequality bad America GDP per capita reliable statistic. insane. aside, median income person Mississippi still $7000 person UK. I'm sure San Fransisco great comparison people also earn shittons highest housing prices world.. CT hospitalizations gone every week since late April. 1971 hospitalizations April 24 62 now. Quintessential america. Smh vaccine literally determine colleges fully open spring semester, determine normal 2021, determine everything. fair, using non-FDA approved test isnt covered CARES act. accuracy questionnable Touché. country's response shit storm dumpster fire, would calling slanderous dumpster fires world over. kids get it?  open schools children 5 9? pleateaued nightmare levels good news? 

plateauing record numbers means everything stays horrible every day... wake Sue medical costs get it. 7 day moving average deaths 550ish start month, around 830. significant upwards trend deaths, stable all. it’s ingredient substitutions definitely social routine, it’s following local Fry’s (Kroger)

1. Order can’t pick least week they’re backed up. may say plan week out, sure order let’s say couple dozen eggs breakfast week show don’t tell substitutes order they’re eggs entirely (yes really happened me). what? Put another order eggs wait another week meantime don’t eat breakfast? 

2. Go sit parking lot inches cars designated spots that’s them. won’t touch car get around people next loading cars also employees. 

3. got multiple frozen items completely melted bad. Note: live AZ 117 degrees past week don’t take frozen items immediately freezer freezer go bad.

4. received multiple containers moldy produce. Things would bought otherwise. 

So me, I’m going rub shoulders people anyways (point 2) would go store mask gloves? self-checkout avoid getting close people store much possible. Allow park way far don’t load car next people. honestly tell alternative curbside pickup actually safer? KEEP AMERICA GREAT 2020 kidding actually thought gov cared you. mean people slaved lives put towards unemployment still seen losing jobs. truly thought republicans democrates cared wow welcome reality. dont care vote all. Can't afford new phone job.


Don't need new phone staying home. I, dumbass parents adopted 11 kids (I 7th).   places country live need violate zoning laws afford rent. Reduced testing certainly causes R^t drop. [AZ's R^t technically testing backlog 67,000 tests right now. think AZ fits profile draw better GA. [IMHO, state ways things subside. first instinct GA would blame pandemic fatigue. think people getting sick feels like ""just flu"" cold (80% COVID illnesses do) maybe 1/3 bother get tested. would think would true mask-resistant areas. 'mask-resistant' describe GA you? 

I answers. covering here: alone. write something around 31% problems. Yeah we're fucked. mentioned underlying medical conditions? though? Hypertension? Hypertension affects 1 2 adults ( ). scary.

Sars-CoV2 (the virus causes COVID-19) variant SARS face problems developing vaccine original SARS virus. exist?

Sure circumstances people interact lead spread people wearing masks social distancing likely spread. got tested Verily baseline SJ well. wont get results 2 days. Mine everyone know took full 5 business days. got tested Tuesday get back til following Tuesday That’s exactly Chinese people felt February. guess situation naturally repeats itself. lost mother virus days ago don’t know myself. able say goodbye hardest part. can’t imagine poor children must going heart goes them. I'm curious America first campers . gonna wait one developed american science?? made news headline... hit 1,000 deaths across US yesterday. That’s first time happened since April. something like 70 total cases instead historical tens thousands.

That really astounding immigrants general, talking recent event Syrian refugees fleeing US Paris attacks. House passed bill blocking unless passed strict background check 64% Americans voted (11% saying ""it's okay they're Christian, they're Christian"").

Being immigrant, tell lot rich people hate immigrants. mean, experience obviously anecdotal, still. whole lot rich racists there.

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless, comment supposed joke. feel dumb. people dumb. pass guess little nothing job truly worth it. smh. better let one know economy crashing completely next months. Except lie [this data pretend show daily deaths starting rise again, 2 weeks, claim personally invented protective masks.  50-person restriction events almost rest personal responsibility, indications people neighbouring countries less informed responsible are. far least amount testing Nordic countries poor tracing (that also expected ourselves).

More infection less testing tracing means disadvantage moving Fall Winter. also hardly restrictions already do, whereas Nordic countries already framework tested effective measures populace already know adhere to.

Calling situation advantage laughable calling strategy best Spring. college student, really hoping semester could normal back graduated, gonna happen, still hope next semester little better multiple vaccines(Oxford, Moderna) then, already risk people vaccinated. here. aren’t reopening office there’s vaccine. **I know happening US, instructions Israel clear: signs cold: forbidden get work / leave house!** know problem teaching children 10 home. Teen seem ones need education they're going miss post-secondary credits case can't schools spread like adults. Loan? Hell no. I'm happy risk tax dollars this. idea speed manufacture vaccine guaranteeing demand.

Pfizer limited incentive manufacture large quantities vaccine sure going approved. want vaccine ready, manufactured, day approved. world wait extra six months approval manufacturers ramp production?

The US pre-buy AstraZeneca too. course moderna. I'm mistaken, sounds like US pre-purchsed $1 billion doses far. don’t think know many American families assuming family deaths non correlated. pool families could happen tens millions. odds infection spouse infected basically 100% odds unhealthy lifestyle risk factors spouse quite high.

You can’t say parent 1 dying = 1% * parent 2 dying (also 1%) = 0.01%. They’re statistically correlated.  got ur /s 
;)  Folks said mess unmasked lot problems. I'm going disagree. cost mandated, robust paid sick leave?? 

Think **incentives**. getting paid, *might* get paid due concern illness, many many people take off. Many **downplay** symptoms mind make comfortable - go work, take care family. 

That's exact opposite behavior want, what's incentivized. interaction healthcare system could really costly many avoid unless absolutely necessary. 

I see stuff time. I've see patients talk essentially blew shortness breath continued go business stores etc. I've heard doctors imply they're fan fever checks hospital sent away due testing high temperature means shift less pay. 

There companies great policies, sometimes probably culture issue policy issue. general incentives disincentives leave little faith 99 100 times people ""do right thing"" self quarantine symptomatic. practice means assume everyone hotspot region behave accordingly. GA Tech modeling estimated random collection 10 people county 55% chance one it. That's virtual guarantee exposure stores unless careful mindful viral load. (tl; dr: simple think is, whole discussion based 'over Christmas' - simply possible.)

While tempting reduce things basic components, cautious so. Regardless simple believe product (and missed mechanical pieces, mention labeling, inserts, packaging, etc), process distributing product simple - especially *new* product *yet approved*.

That approval date easy predict. Oxford saying sometime December, maybe. member pharmaceuticals ethics panel speculating September/October. Let us pretend vaccine approved December 1.

Now get distribution argument.

That number Amazon truly impressive. one must note *distribution* (and sales) machine, producer. distinction two cannot overstated. Oxford use Amazon distribute product (they won't), could reasonably assume maximum efficiency.

But enough?

Let's talk distinction two entities. producer, Oxford single source. may multiple warehouses full vaccine December 1 (doubtful, possible), warehouses necessarily going near original production site. product simply cannot distributed approved release. Yet Amazon's impressive product distribution relies multitude product sources, located globe. California, Amazon warehouses place. warehouses pre-stocked products multitude sources, would advantage vaccine. would draw single source - Oxford - distribute out. illogical comparison.

Remember, Oxford projecting 500 million units per year production, ramped 'in early 2021.' many units say produced December 31? don't.

So know many vaccines available, available, available distributed one location out, unlike Amazon's current model.

How units distributed around globe, anyway? *Are* shipped outside UK outset? get wrong - ecstatic first people get vaccines, matter live, discussion starts idea 'this Christmas.' Oxford send vaccines overseas, going shipped?

Amazon good, always fast. realize, based reduction product earlier, may aware potential storage shipping requirements vaccine (hell, know either, yet), forgiven assuming simple packing product boxes shipping air. However, may well specific handling conditions required limit shipping capacity. may make sense send quantities needed ship, specialized containers. Cargo ships take 10 - 20 days cross Atlantic, sea conditions permitting. Granting emergency docking clearance (no waiting sea containers), unload containers onto trucks perhaps trains, distribute throughout US. Even target hardest hit states, talking days hospitals, doctors offices, pharmacies see needles serum - addition previous journey. 

And assuming adequate supply UK US only! 

Over Christmas? Sorry, wishful thinking. People need prepare Christmas without vaccine, COVID-19 still spreading. Frankly, true whether Oxford releases vaccine December not. lucky receive vaccine then, Christmas may lot brighter. vast majority us, different.

Edit: caveat enters chat. Pfizer 'is hoping' October release. would change discussion quite bit US. Superb terrifying. I'm sure Trump try put ""Provided Donald J. Trump"", tackily embossed faux gold, somewhere syringe. Ok take rushed vaccine. Ill wait read back March potentially damage testicles, confirmed thing? slowest tsunami ever Cool bro.

Nobody know got back less 5. tells us? data Cuomo gives us everyday mistaken? Confused. said lower classes inextricably tied race. say things play role. Nice reversal.

Also, take statistics class. first paragraph drivel. supervisor missed almost two weeks waiting results, came back negative. He's *supposed* still get paid program created specifically situation. think called CARES Act. 

According supervisor, employer supposed filing paperwork. situation might different though; supervisor's sister tested positive, quarantine get tested. Ah, makes sense. actually really thought fact expectation /you/ would contact people, DoH would. sounds like tell people calling (re: tested positive). confirmation purposes makes sense, wonder that's dangerous people. Like, cousin bananas tried get revenge somehow. (I clearly need stop watching much Netflix Amazon Prime :D)

Guran-fucking-tee you, polls leading double digits Biden would seeing none sudden ""concern"". think otherwise (that *not* narcissistic sociopath) completely delusional. genuinely curious many hospital beds/icu beds Florida left?

Sad...Florida governor much blood hands. don’t know sleeps night tbh. Yes felt like guess hindsight way way low, point say ""not many"" still way much. response op, guess im looking like multiple family members specifically child losing parents. think likely hood multiple family members getting infected already high, factor living conditions, underlying heath, things like sending kids back school, think gets worse here. higher infection rate lower true death rate that's good news. people sick enough go hospital really think US elementary schools follow guidelines Denmark?

I know? really see relevant either. everything US. 6 adults, since patient zero wasn’t counted 16. Probably 3 married couples 3-4 kids each. "" 24 times higher Missouri ""

Woohoo! Okay, I'm skeptical number, would great news 15% state already it.  Apparently least likely spreader lol. jump hoolahoops time trying prove obviously flawed point? Appreciate always. 

What’s Personal take high positivity rate seemingly tapered testing numbers? 

I felt like getting 60-80k it’s back 45-60 range again. Another Karen — companies ban customers behave like asshole. I’m sick tired entitled idiots. K-9 instincts !! Yeah, it’s basically infectious flu isn’t necessarily true - coworker tested walk testing site couple weeks ago took 5 days. coworker went urgent care center got test results 2 days (his medical insurance paid testing). know use internet health insurance, results come MUCH quicker state run drive testing. Sorry, get it. What's apple analogy? I'm American shoot I'm wrong here, immigration US tough? safe assume black Asian migrants US refugees likely better educated, better set life afford move country? Perhaps group people highly skilled comparison black Americans occupy better paid skilled jobs. would skew stats somewhat Uhhh I’ve exact symptoms lately also sick back March. That’s bit alarming lol Danes already considerate. Experts believe authorities start recommending masks. do, Danes start wearing them. struggle reading comprehension? everything keep saying i've already discussed you. ok tell alternative shop you, mask wearer, fucking option? i'm fighting ""antimask fuckwads"" i'm fighting want safe cannot wear mask feel like suffocating. 

They get help shopping locked house 6 months healthy mental health allow face shields allow get feel like productive taken care of? people comfortable shopping around people face shields options. difficult literally given EVERYONE option. antimask? shop online someone shop you. ok masks face shields? shop inside use options. feel safe around wearing masks? shop online someone shop you. solution met much resistance given possible solutions make people feel safe?

These friends generally scared surroundings always feel unsafe. fear feelings mask feel like suffocating. I'm trying help work around still feeling part society. get people need really uncomfortable think ways make less people uncomfortable still keeping people safe.

No would agree reasonable i'm talking people wearing anything i'm talking people wearing face shield. yes effective mask still effective. like making store N95 surgical masks studies homemade cloth masks nearly effective masks. I've looked seems jury still effective shields without mask stated protect others aerosols even effective masks. One report mentioned wearing face shield cloth covering around bottom. think would good compromise would let people shop also give feeling suffocating. Remember 98% cure rate That, friend good news Indian, I'm unable understand controversy masks US. also politically divided country right wing left wing leaders governing states right wing central government.
But, everyone supports wearing masks. Even people large support although many following diligently. Oh my, that’s rough. Praying you. Haha. Nothing going me. Im well, time come make fun guys.. Im upset, talk way time. Bunch soft snowflakes thread..

Funnily enough countries like Germany example banned yeeears ago. Jesus yap yap yap. assumption correct know it. people poor fuck make terrible life choices, children forever generationally pay price for. cared people much pretend to, want people less kids benefit. quote shit stats. know got values, average children 18 per family US less 2. soon Many people state even gotten UE first place, despite applying months ago calling every day  La county shut 5 fucking months

Miami-dade county stay home MARCH mandatory masks April

Apple mobility data showed almost everyone obeyed it. 

Cases surged June July % positive finally coming back % hospitalizations reporting COVID symptoms peak.

What fuck narrative “if acted like good citizens locked would beaten it”

The data shows literally told. ran course anyway. Yikes. take enjoying death suffering? Holy shit stretch insane assumption. 

America third world shithole? WTF about.

Mocking dead Americans? Yeah, there's sense talking you. debating things even said. also checked comment history filled attacking people making problem everything. bit high drama.

This convo lead anything. good day. first Chinese consulate US, kind symbolic escalation Easy say live city actually cares. Mine sure hell doesn’t. second highest number cases entire state California. true, though. Several coming vaccines RNA vaccines means contain protein corona virus (ie spike protein) corona virus itself. MUCH WINNING! /s met resistence.

Here real life? hard time believing people would actually give elderly person (I'm guessing that's talking it) shit wearing shield grocery store. I'm Colorado, mandate actually face coverings, masks. Shields fit definition.  like one thank you! know hospice nurse CT wherever working need test ruled COVID. usually give COVID test death unless remaining questions due lack tests. lot. That's competent leadership crucial.

I know anyone blames pandemic entirely Trump. countries blindsided virus avoided every infection. actions local governments corporations also facilitated spread, course, Democrats ways incompetent. Trump called pandemic ""Democratic hoax,"" repeatedly spread misinformation, delayed action long possible. pretend play *major* role America's chapter COVID-19 unrealistic. say ""at least ten times..."" spanish study done 30,000 families showed around 14% positives lost antibodies period 2 months. Interestingly, Spain also concluded counted 10% cases peak pandemic, like US now. Probably added University headline  apparently read posts, praise Sweden.

Work hard, nice, stay human safe! right, truthfully honestly, always. asking fatality rate strictly confirmed covid positive patients

That depends many people tested methodology (testing hospitalized people, testing known contact, testing everybody respiratory symptoms etc), number largely meaningless.

The death rate among people show symptoms (however light) guess, people light symptoms come hospital never tested included statistics unless known contact confirmed case. think paper said ""China Virus"" part ad lib?  One mother’s friends tested positive early/mid-April, hospitalized, recovered, mid/late-March. Tested negative twice, well.

Come mid-June, went hospital thought heart attack. tested her, she’s positive COVID. Minimal respiratory symptoms, she’s chest pains, abdominal pains (apparently kidneys), horrible headaches, etc.

Haven’t checked see it’s going couple weeks, imagine I’d know dead. guess one biggest frustrations is, asked doctor(s) long thought might last, said didn’t know, may may temporary.

I can’t even imagine staring prospect “feeling like I’m heart attack several times day enduring crippling migraine-like headaches rest life”. supposed add ZINC, Azth. can't single one ""debunking HCQ"" studies try ZINC! That's India Russia suggesting works, HCQ alone random drugs. makes zero sense. Ultimately, people barely scraping by, businesses fail greater rate, less products sold, everyone suffers. fiscal Republican looking trajectory virus, I’d 100% clamoring $600 people. astounds anyone sees upside causing mass homelessness despair. you.. 
today clouded brain well threw pasta sauce pan instead water....🙈
Luckily nothing major yet.. say soon ask body deliver familiar energy levels before.. Covid rebounces.. frustrating indeed..
All best may ""we"" find medicine treats it. worth vaccine ask me.
cheers! shit sherlock google search EU countries quarter growths see different story, i.e. Sweden staying relatively flat (even grew 0.1% Q1) neighbouring eu countries negative growth. I’m glad said he’s hypocrite. Youtube net people hundreds thousands dollars month, including sponsors merch.

It's nuts I'll never see much life guys make couple months, people like Paul brothers absolute shit stains. Would California able prosecute that? selfish individual needs face criminal charges agree federal government cannot enforce mask mandate own. think ideally federal government gives clear direction mask use, state also give direction mask use, local governments officers charge enforcing them, probably citations. Surely would rules—only required public enclosed spaces, instance—but generally would structure. guess similar traffic laws. 

While stopping virus tracks would ideal, also quite costly. may local spots extreme, costly measures necessary. Lowering infection rate definitely goal help hospitals. seems easy, effective way require face masks indoor public spaces. idea significant cause spread infected individuals don’t know it. wear masks public, MUCH less likely spread virus, even though don’t know it.

In best-case scenario vaccine still months out. rate dying, that’s whole lot Americans aren’t gonna make long. that’s gotta now. talking issue discussion. Poverty effects medical care, education, housing, etc.

You turned race issues evidence support it. 

You one addressing I'm asking. PoC get higher mortgage rates credit score determines rate? 

"" You’re ignoring whole part black people likely worse credit score why. ""

So saying white person living poverty higher credit score based color skin?

You set narrative racism cause PoC poverty disadvantages brings yet completely ignoring fact whites country poverty PoC.

You're telling I'm ignoring evidence yet presenting evidence racism cause poverty......and call typical ""stop talking"".....next call racist that's easier supporting narrative evidence. think buffets survive concept, local ones currently business face issues staying open sure easy drive case hospitalization fatality rate simply finding cases people sick.

And painfully true: easy manipulate CFR numbers. guess would good people (actually) unable wear masks due medical condition? wow really sucks. that's ridiculous really!! I'm pretty positive hes already said new interview fox news... see single pop-media article *maybe* case. Much likely factually supported theory virus infects cells nose throat responsible mucus production, taste, smell. cells infected, sensory neurons start die/fail systems maintained (those cells) infected. brainwashed fallen serious propaganda friend. Careful fooled easily become mindless political extremist. No, misinformation dangerous pandemic. guy asking cited information, vast majority guys responding ridiculous nonsense value. best way prepare? sounds like anxiety That's true. know old saying.

there's point hounding - care - makes whatever facts wants. Sweden expects people volunteer contact tracing

Sure sure, innocent lambs gonna good little angels tell went 🙄 Considering $600 extra weekly unemployment payment coming end, many people able afford take time even unemployment. states, unemployment benefits percentage person's normal wages. think MN 60%. 40% difference normal life starving and/or homelessness many families. jail year. Fuck disgusting entitled white privileged sociopaths California decriminalized knowingly passing HIV? okkkk   /r/coronavirus rejoice! Fun fact. federal job gave harassment training referring classified harassment. Land development real estate CA always massively corrupt, way back 1920s. Political legal pressure utilized push back, easy. Hell, made academy award-winning movies it. need comment. name isn’t Oscar, loser. believe info also many flu deaths ESTIMATES. [And What's stupid it? convenient, easy, saves small amount money, came handy. Literally upside. Cool voted asking clarifying question partisan statement. 

NY curve better now, always case. guess question matters most. NY flattened curve quicker less cases deaths, better? obviously multiple factors curve (and statistics) can't capture. know data go next 12 months. Remember, New York Texas shut time look happened. 

Being Houston, people know are, past 3 months advocating wearing masks. I've working home since March. tends far right/far left area really flout rules. (I would call antivax crowd far left, even though went Trump) ""traditional"" Republicans wearing masks, despite leadership does. [But hey, look Republicans New democratic governor, idk. Maybe Colorado? think governor would keep schools open, ""no matter what."" yeah, keeping kids home end year reassess. question. little data it’s crazy.

The complete absence data is, way, data. outbreak linked air exact opposite lockdown

Outdoors, significant fraction wearing spike guess we’re good open back up

Except lot data shows opening restaurants bars caused massive outbreaks require another shutdown control. discussing efficiency city bringing efficiency mass transit wholly irrelevant? hope fake news. cases patient felt mostly fine condition suddenly deteriorated 

This happened sister. Talked one day symptoms fairly low key, within 24 hours ER. relatively healthy (works regularly, healthy diet, stays well hydrated, etc.), 40s, major health issues lives with, still kicked ass.

For record, recovered fine now, tense days. go something like this, direct talk expert field rather draw conclusion something know nothing about. 

I walk point point B 10 minutes run path 5 minutes. still traveled distance. ran mean skipped steps took shortcuts make journey. Come on, cant keep worthless. thanking even job. /s emergency room high risk. high risk outside corona catching diseases. Dentist high/medium. eating inside risky someone put hands inside mouth face inches away (even mask)? Museum debatable too. Yes, large rooms social distancing possible actually help indoors? picking takeout food low risk?

If grabbing food someone else, interacting hundreds people day, I'd say risk high.

I never understood people equate low risk. highest risk ask me. Contact sports person day low risk. Grabbing takeout someone waiting line 20 minutes high risk.

These people shit backwards.. Came say this. Exactly.  Headlines like counterproductive give ammunition say, ""See? It'll never go away anyway need back back normal live it!"" Kids die sorts ways. Accidents accounting 50 percent. also lock children safety cages 18?

Here's fun anecdote me, Californian:

I've mild sore throat cough past couple days, which, normal times, give second thought.

But parents dealing health issues moment: mom ER Sunday blood pressure shot dangerously, already respective health issues make especially susceptible Covid-19, want go spend time help out.

However, given potential Covid-19 symptoms, need 100% sure I'm infected head them.

On Sunday, went online schedule test appointment Project Baseline. slots available locations within 30-mile radius. site helpfully suggested try morning.

There were, indeed, available appointments listed Monday morning, soonest available Thursday 23rd (a four-day wait). based hearing reading anecdotally, almost certainly going take 7 days get results - surprise takes 10 days.

At rate, may well skip test entirely remain quarantined requisite 14 days(?) since symptoms first emerged. probably middle class things say, know difficult working class children virtual classes actually used homophobic slur describe masks. even citizen yet, people REALLY hated lmao SE Asian countries flung borders open invite tourists again. Tourism really resumed.

That's situation Barcelona right now. summed entire campaign strategy, like that. days ago, Chris Wallace showed new poll he's getting destroyed Biden, he's sprinting back cover mistakes.

Vietnamese masks still mandatory public transit. Hmm kinda wondering laboratories made different. Like us labs behind ? Way go! I'm UK, known anyone personally since testing easily available, employer employees going back in-person work get report email every time someone shows symptoms. delay ""they've tested"" ""they tested x"" (all negative, thankfully) emails still usually couple days.

""Data outcomes scarce."" article linked back claim. 

The science inconsistent, nonexistent. claim somehow least hygienic age group somehow vector spread laughable. Kids isolated adults, I'm damn sure checking ids infects somebody. zero evidence support claim age group less likely spread virus amount contact. half K-12 students children, biologically speaking adolescents children therefore expected affected COVID way children useful calling company family employees.

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED LET'S GO APPLEBEES. Great job, Karen  approximately zero emotional investment.

Bruh, we're asking wear mask maybe social distance. emotional investment? Unless he's talking healthy kids, elderly family lives another state. 

Yeah, kids healthy friends? elderly family members interact healthy people? everyone thinks like does, someone's gonna slip infection spread. wears mask socially distances, least say likely (unpleasant term selfish person) passed onto someone fear getting and/or bringing home.

I bet Coronavirus take bravery account deciding whether infect not. way people close proximity spread virus. could known yep businessowners people opnions

Well tend philosophical sort thing lot different. sadly myopic. Wuhan good job. Wuhan US-level stupid. China’s national response extreme enough counteract it. sure would, scientists care business, want science paycheck. government provide paycheck away go.  first year (I’m 38) I’ve ever thought going work sick. parents every job I’ve ever always “if stand, work” jobs bars restaurants. people need locked sadly. nice simply work.

""Seeing traces find microscope"" different ""permanent disability"" though, right?

If doctor looked lungs would able see used smoker. ""damage lungs"". affect life way.  Could possibly shave months life expectancy? Sure. Possibly. diet, sleeping patterns, amount exercise dont do.

I think bit inaccurate interpret every finding ""damage organs"" kind chronic condition.

Every time go see plenty people without masks wearing wrong. Trump stuff popping everywhere. Flags, yard signs, redneck conservatives wearing camo Trump 2020 hats. We're saving move soon safer public. pretty nerve wracking. Read article, children. Sounds like 5 6 adults. would I, I'm also financial employment situation affords ability take time off, pay food delivery, etc. ridiculous amount Americans aren't. W.T.F. ?!? evidence transmission children adults schools? Oxford Professor paediatrics BBC last week saying exact same.  Trump fucking moron getting late game. asshole incited people wear changes tune. damn time asshat anything masks.

Sounds like good idea theory, would cause many problems practice.

Just require masks, sanitize everything, ensure social distancing put plastic screens checkout. best do. CDC send letters patients tests positive local health department? Someone know usually pretty discerning claiming friend received negative result got letter CDC saying tested positive. Ignoring mismatched results, CDC even send letters test results? Yeah people clearly good making life choices didn’t speak English took coming USA realize crazy mf Definitely cost / energy issue. Many retrofit new installations tested costly certify desired effect virus. cost passed consumer (LLs operators) pass cost tenants occupants.

Plenty people building got virus early (this ny). rhyme reason got think transmission within bldg major vector. Reason ton tenants continued operate site full half staff throughout shutdown virtually one got sick soon shutdown started despite 50 - 70% continued occupancy. bldg like one would think folks one office infected surely businesses floor, stack, common elevators, elevator landings, common restrooms, would infected happen. Granted start ny lockdown (PAUSE) around time everyone started wearing masks public surely reduced transmission large, life understand bldg become hot zone transmission. Like straight put giant bag building walk away. happen know why. intentionally obtuse?

You obviously are. want remove data data set actual reason support position. That's unbelievable dishonest.

Nursing homes significant fraction death toll everywhere. poorly managed every country. Drop mike. ones stopping helping 🤷🏼‍♂️ Apparently, took 14 days... Worldometer shows 4 million cases US today. get tested, self isolate get results.

My wife last week awaiting results. Happily came within day half negative. Wow wonder BODY would that, like there's huge stigma surrounding virus due fear propaganda...  visible viruses much easier clean. don’t know source. Never seen here. Sounds like trade open economy kill teachers student’s parents. ok. Neither one (masks, disinfecting) eliminates airborne presence. Larger building size (with free range air) grocery store allows dilution average pocket air, preferable smaller office sized facility terms avoiding exposure infectious dose airborne viral particles. THANK YOU. Finally fucking sense ... getting sick nonsense speculation users ... panicking nothing ... think so? Around half country believe science, vaccines less powerful large numbers people opt out. lists bunch low risk summer activities do. reason weddings probably one biggest industries RI. least honest risk level.  trying rude, actual evidence this?  think flu cause lung damage right? Bar owners also clear guidance government cannot server individual.

Store owners basically told people can't wear masks nothing (other, than, assume, make alternate accommodations, small store may difficulty doing).

Just protests helped spread mean every city got hit hard. apply thing certain smaller places opened. (My actual hometown really touched besides open)

Cali didnt reopen compared states. see stupid fucking state.  Swine flu called flu now. peculiar strain flu particularly deadly, ran course without destroying hospitals less contagious less deadly current plague containing medical contexts easier.

I absolutely hate people ignore actual stats facts related virus, instead pretend something fits narrative. sub pinnacle that.

If read nothing sub knowledge virus think ridiculous plague kill anyone regardless age. think needed spend everyday indoors we'd die. Fact is, even close that.  Well that's kinda blown way proportion. vast majority infected people symptoms does.

Not saying can't kill, obviously can, I'm pointing actually blown proportion look cases VS deaths. even cases VS hospitalizations guy licking doorknobs? Okay, that's good know.

Really glad states this. may late, action better none. Theres difference anti-vaxxers people wary rushed vaccine though

No isn’t. relatable aren’t convinced it’s going safe either. aren’t unfathomable motives. differ safe feel vaccines crazier margins anti-vax movement supported shared sense isolation. great opportunity us stop marginalizing whole since many us shared hesitation. use opportunity include discussion *honestly* address reasonable anxiety new vaccines.

However, cost housing Santa Barbara 5x national average. yes, even though legal limits many people live one house, laws seldom enforced areas crazy cost living expenses. Throw something like pandemic, isolation/quarantine impossible 16 people living one house.

Quarantine impossible. again, I'm assuming here, lives type situation, probably minimum wage worker, possibly even undocumented. may safety net unemployment help tide quarantine. 

If local governments commandeer hotels homeless housing, maybe something similar arranged quarantine housing? fully agree shithole, that's bit cruel reply.

Estimated deaths little certain.

But sure, factor two terms IFR. Wow, uber list - agree every item it.  
(Though know IBAN is; I'm sure agree you) interesting read studies still going office, I'd eat lunch car remote outdoor location.

I wear respirator (just COVID, public), though, makes things extra problematic. like take can't clean it.

Hidalgo also Democrat, as, instrumental. I'd think Abbott stopped playing games things became real here. said, statewide shut came much earlier curve NY's. last long, drove numbers well. 

But question remains, let's pretend curve plateau real, halfway through. double numbers, real. New York's numbers real too. Let's say end 700k million cases 9k deaths roughly 30 million. New York get cases deaths, 413k cases 32k deaths roughly 20 million. better job?

As antivax crowd, well [they pretty split. Trump good job bringing side. 

But ran Republican party, never really Republican anyway. think anyone, except Trump himself, thinks force schools open. 

(FWIW I'm registered Democrat) So, time type this, post directly titled ""CDC: Antibody tests show virus rates 10 times higher reported""

WTF supposed even make statements. going trust study virus time. condemnation science. think way early science long way go even begin understand thing.

I also think *will* get there. take particular number, theory, study gospel right mistake. Science constantly evolving, virus apparently well, lengthy journey. original study.

I read article. say every one earlier estimates giving lower number fundamentally obviously flawed, much scientific community hyped idea &lt;&lt;0.5% IFR stayed bandwagon anyway. Even today, everyone wants find serology study pick death count makes happy go divide get IFR.

There essentially good studies done inside US. best NYC data: something like 20% infected one serology study done grocery stores single week. combine death count choose - confirmed deaths, probable deaths (0.27% PFR 1.35% IFR), excess deaths (0.31% PFR 1.55% IFR). sounds high, essentially consistent every number Europe well. Belgium similar IFR country-wide study, broke approximately 0.5% IFR outside nursing homes 50% nursing homes - seems likely NYC well. Yes, seeing behaviors first world countries increasing rate. even troubling economic status become insecure escalation violence.

Even go now, shop store actually instead actually getting food want. know people swear I've yet shopping trip, every 3 weeks March thru May every 2 weeks since going back work May, half groceries want get store instead scrounge what's there. see ordering online pickup ever working guarantee I'll get exactly want. including near impossibility getting pickup time compatible schedule. issue people posting articles, referencing briefly context excerpt otherwise decently nuanced interview answer, forum people read headlines best times, much less article Norwegian? far fetched Swedish people get upset people engage misinformation? Sure, plenty unqualified people (Swedes included) talking bullshit everything fine, also plenty unqualified people exact opposite opinions.

Personally, I've got lot criticism aimed way epidemic handled here, still brainwashed fool think discussion factual basis?

Bonus points linking author experience field. competent discussion. many times yet? 👻😷  make sense still testing positive... /s Hospitals likely need bailed find can't collect people dead work due health issues. 



Reminds one guy weeks ago stuck 100k bill leaving hospital COVID. problem hospitals problem cause sure hell paying it. So, time type this, post directly titled ""CDC Coronavirus Test Kits Generate 30% False Positive 20% False Negative Results.""

WTF supposed even make statements. going trust study virus time. condemnation science. think way early science long way go even begin understand thing.

I also think *will* get there. take particular number, theory, study gospel right mistake. Science constantly evolving, virus apparently well, lengthy journey. Oh JFC make good point. bet every person sneakily removed rolls, corpse might snuck back on....fuck.  1. That's rate.
2. Compare total mortality adjusted age distribution.
3. year ended yet. NPR:

Fact:
""We recognize extraordinary times, pricing reflect term pandemic,"" Pfizer's chief business officer, John Young, said hearing. ""We'll price potential vaccine consistent urgent global emergency we're facing. secondly also believe, critically, COVID vaccines free public. vaccine meaningless people unable afford it.""

Fact: agreement also allows government acquire additional 500 million doses Pfizer vaccine. worldometers get numbers from? still NY front. another commercial says ""during difficult times..."" one time it’s mouth? Good know, thank you! Yes is, 4 years. hospitals everyone wears surgical mask unless direct patient contact covids. companies treated employees crisis likely define decades come... Funny thing conversation tone can't discerned accurately. actually know person coming from.

One funny thing, ignore overall cost privatised healthcare per citizen. ignore numbers, see private health care options recieve much money private citizens publically subsidized options give without private healthcare. However binary issue. immune population increases ability virus spread decreases. Even little 10% immune population wonders slow exponential growth. sniffle strongman!  Ok, would alternative? Calais, CA Sure, priority economy politics, would told everyone go things, wear mask so.

I concede thought might either stupid political look science this, leading genuinely think big deal. exactly warned would become. Republicans promoted anti-science facts. sound practical many reasons. 

1. would need 100% sure disease want eradicate **only** reservoir population animals chose, extremely difficult since diseases many possible reservoirs know about. Acording [this study influenza 
""*sustained influenza outbreaks occurred poultry number mammalian species, including humans, pigs, horses, seals, mink*."" That's lot different species account for. 

2. order eradicate species would need either vaccinate animal species safe *working* vaccine works separate species, kill every infected animal. would hard make vaccine takes long time make vaccine run though clinical trials (the vaccines SARS-CoV-2 fast tracked even taken long time even get stage 3 clinical trials) animal. would hard kill infected animals need test one either gut set free, would raise ethical concerns many people. 

3. Say, hypothetically, 1 2 done eliminate influenza (for example) animals. What's stopping new strain infecting them, mutating, infecting humans/other animals? whole process would restart. 

4. would super expensive waste research time could put something **much** useful society US ever fight war China need able produce weapon vaccine. work ridiculous, quit weeks lockdown. boss expected us Zoom 9am 5pm, get turn audio lunch. faint bit hope things eventually get back normal pretty much left mentally. pray GOD you’re right. So, wrong, he's lying actively ignoring constituents.

This end well... area? also hard time believing already spread person time knew one us it

I mean spoke whole idea original comment, futher reply. yeah. realize. Lol able mourn beyond awful. He’s got take care kids right now. That’s end major, long term issues. 

I hope solid support system sticks around longer couple weeks everyone else moves on. low risk tolerance autoimmune lung disease, husband not. 

He’s pretty burnt wants get back normal, seeing family distancing. miss family too, I’d rather see via video chat now, though don’t timeline that. It’s hard seeing friends opposite.

His argument basically said, where’s line, there’s never vaccine, it’s like forever? it’s causing tension. live 3 children, own, i'm trying ""hard no"" house thousands flu related deaths every year, varies thousand 50,000. thing good chunk deaths actually opportunistic infections like bacterial pneumonia. Hence, flu related flu.

That one big difference COVID-19. causes pneumonia secondary infection. personally believe people survive lifelong good luck. Let's keep making shit up. US response coronavirus oil. finger hurts scroll far get ""The land free.""  even give fuck.


It's actively encouraging programs principles effectively put salt wound. Compassion decency words days rare put practice. Better late never. Hopefully fellow Ohioans follow science doubts. What, government 12 months liquid funds? Funny expectations exist individuals not, ya know, organizations actually plan far ahead.  imagine Ohio would look right stuck decision? We'd boat NY NJ Connecticut state case explosion  viruses microbes. thinking anti-biotics, work bacteria. *cries quarantine* Republicans sowing doubt coronavirus statistics least two months. White House recently moved make coronavirus figures opaque, ordering hospitals submit data cases deaths Department Health Human Services, led Trump loyalist, instead Centers Disease Control Prevention.   time traveler, I'd go back edit graduating class' yearbooks ""most likely” page include stupid ass... 

""Most likely urinate store global pandemic"" 

That remembered earth, congrats.  else covered suit

Isn't whole thing suit?

I thought spray tan cover zippers people figure he's actually three earthworms human costume... I’m 24 shit that’s young 😢 feel bad them. Never got grow knew? Albany got absolutely ravaged COVID early, absolutely puff peace. reason ""beat back"" covid nearly half county already it. absolutely volume. pandemic like giant actuarial problem layers risk. 

It's like riding motorcycle vs driving car. easily live till 80+ riding bike, yet pool always higher death rate car drivers. add factors like wearing helmet riding weekends rather primary mode transport radically different pools likely outcomes, yet simple black white determination happen you.


An Uber taking chance 1 1 someone Covid still less overall risk public transport 15-20 people, even transmission easy scenarios, arguably easier Uber large bus subway. Russian money influence article implies correlation causation. Mom one didn’t care us-she cared outside world thought her. figured could unleash us couldn’t get away. Geez Yeah, definitely. Even survey sent people confirmed cases could provide insight though. Hopefully info gathered speak. Strange way flatten curve  No. Fucking. Shit. Glad study confirm though.  Yeah think issue arguing extreme edge case. every one person legit concerns use shield, thousands others selfish assholes. Science. Masks needed, hopefully new rules enforced would impossible infect literally every member US population. awful. father passed (unexpectedly abruptly), immediately overwhelmed desperate urge talk him. sudden, feeling ""i need mommy/daddy"" never ever goes away. get used hole heart, hole heart stays forever. re-play instances make time, rushed phone call things going on.

You always another chance talk DONT. Oh gosh used word 'literally', safe space need?

You...you think virus can't survive...outside? Burn whew good thinking man, good forward thinking, you’re safe 5G airborne commandos case, know, shit goes south need protect checking. Apparently peer review articles journal every 2 months. pre-print reviewed yet. pre-print unlikely actually make journal jumped PubMed beyond though. live worst state kinda thing. Pay rent homeless. Go work lose job. Nobody seems care let alone believe it’s real. It’s scary. pneumonia once, comes quick leaves slower  Let’s see far goes terms enforced! sure average homeowner would willing pay buy robots though. 

Don't forget landscapers also terrain grading, tree prunung, hedge installation &amp; lay patio stones, various things. things may able automated everything. 

Also mentioned hard outsource tree pruning &amp; terrain grading Bangalore pennies dollar. adds additional layer job security. indeed 2 dose vaccine. Still...vaccinating 50 million people end year would pretty remarkable huge implications opening country. could vaccinate majority people (e.g. 60%) age 65 plus at-risk vulnerable health workers. 

Remember...the point shutdowns stop everyone getting coronavirus; prevent healthcare systems overwhelmed would generally cut everyone's access healthcare. vaccinated least half at-risk population, would enough start opening get people's jobs back. Hahaha yeh, that's pandemic became real, BH got shit down, devestated. Reported foul language. mean loved one die from. suffer confirmation bias thinking really bad?   need Hell Cell Fauci Trump determine say coronavirus. true America way. Every closet walk-in closet try hard enough. making huge money this? crime? arrested charged attempted murder. Hopefully enforced otherwise help lot person understands flu vaccin article incorrect. 5 6 people flu antibodies year (unvaccinated). mortality rate annual flu 0.002%. Correcting 1 6 get provides infection fatality rate 0.0023% annual flu.

**0.58% IFR SARS-CoV-2 according article would make 248 times deadly common flu.**

Accounting half population vaccinated flu lowers 124 times more.

Source (CDC): got worse ""recovered""? terrifying. intellectually lazy look trends US hospitalizations also needlessly fine-grained pedantic look neighborhood zip code trends within city? mean.... why? Fuckin bunch Cory Trevor's. Fuck. Well, condolences GA. feel incompetent leadership right now. Hope enforced... otherwise it’s useful! also allows companies ramp production trials end considerably less financial risk. Nooooooooo, really?

[I wonder could done  Every society three meals away chaos

Vladimir Lenin addition ongoing respiratory issues, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) starting pop patients recovered.

That interesting definitive statement make.

It true CFS triggered several viral infections (and herpes!)

But would differentiate someone ""CFS"" ""post-viral syndrome""?

[Fauci Warns 'Post-Viral Syndrome' Among COVID-19 Patients Causes Fatigue, Brain Fog name suggests, post-viral syndrome typically occurs person experiences effects virus. develop even seemingly simple bouts flu common person’s body removed virus, post-viral syndrome may make feel drained energy generally unwell. feeling may linger days months viral trigger post-viral syndrome appears reaction virus itself. Many doctors treat post-viral syndrome way treat chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), two similar CFS causes symptoms apparent reason, symptoms post-viral syndrome appear origins isn’t regular flu people recover easily, experts warned. However, weren’t sure live virus immune system’s reaction causing post-viral post-viral syndrome reassurance, self-care symptomatic control. patients suffer sleep disturbances, addressed following sleep hygiene measures. extreme cases, doctors prescribe sleep medications low-dose antidepressants help people. Yoga meditation also aren’t FDA-approved treatments post-viral syndrome, experts recommended therapies like cognitive behavioral therapy, exercise, acupuncture massage. reality that, people luckily get sick, spread virus around, significant number people get sick, leading overcrowded hospitals ICUs. since still treatments proven effective, lot people die. mention consequences people able get treatment conditions. practical impossible.Not cost effective impossible. Hopefully enforced... otherwise it’s useful   Freedumb moron. THIS. got tested almost 2 weeks ago Bay Area potential symptoms potential exposure someone thought may sick. told test results going take 9 days. didn’t find DAY 11+ negative.

Edit: put perspective. got tested potential exposure 4th. got tested 8th didn’t find results 21st. Morocco die, die. beaches actually problem, businesses around beach? open air sun seem like tough conditions virus. Several teachers school staff died Yeah, proof infected children proof weren't.     
We'll never know since children even tested since ""children get covid test them."" /s speechless wonder catch Thank Whew! already got one. go outside hair stands end feel lucky. guess here. people saying ""I'll get it, want first line"" getting two weeks later rest us walking around Disney World without mask going watch Top Gun IMAX theater. read googled author. looks young! I'm glad he's advocating awareness ongoing monitoring suffer longer term impacts. worry may permanent ... that's scary. lockdown would delay spread, herd immunity would seen 2nd spike opening, since isn't, means achieved immunity. Like hospital systems collapsing? That's horizon keeps getting worse, prompt lockdowns, nothing will.

I'm really hoping ""nothing will"" answer. even others SARS-CoV-2 them, harmless part virus inside container. impossible give covid. Bats really weird metabolism immune system fully understand. Bats little (if any) inflammatory response infections. flight, body temperature significantly increases point considered inflammation. probably acts constant ""purge"" place normal immune system. sleeping, metabolism temperature plummet, likely allowing virus maintain foothold. Thus possible infection constantly rise fall without symptoms. Unfortunately results virus moves quickly stages: insertion host cell, replication, propagation within host, infection new host. slow virus gets wiped massive boost metabolism temperature. Bat immune systems care virus. means immune system probably care vaccine.  guess mean he's:-

""Not dead yet"" know mean business shut Shagaluf!!! Yeah pay taxes, taxes used pay government benefits, yes I'm that. GO TEAM STUPID! AMERICA FTW!  think happen again... AIDS / HIV Cancer.

We link think world's governments shit right cause possible lasting change. fuck test positive 3 times like what...is dude sucking face covid positive people? work high risk high volume covid unit yet get it. Nope, adults children bigger bodies bigger bank accounts. Fuck Wow. love make assumptions. donate wounded warrior program charitable organizations. 20 years volunteering various organizations programs throughout United States.

This simply fucking wrong many fucking levels literally know begin. hell wackjobs??? Flattening! That’s also problem think. problem completely ineffective government decades, people don’t trust anymore. It’s fault everyone government trump there, refuse acknowledge think trump end winning again. FINALLY great example states temporary success shouldnt lead premature celebrations shaming states outbreaks. We're going get multiple turns this. way sub. continue point numbers indicate vast majority people contract covid19 fall severely ill, matter. delusional people sub equate contracting virus guaranteed terrible outcomes read articles worst outcomes (which get specific articles written them). read articles millions people get it, need medical intervention, recover. 

Saying something like would paint sort denier I've wearing mask I'm public since May. serious situation want person spread someone else caused bad outcome them, get mean gonna get bad outcome. 

They're upset avid covid denier (Bolsonaro) getting symptoms require hospitalization simply falls vast majority need medical intervention, likely scenario contract unless existing ailments put high risk category received massive viral load.  

Even go super high end estimate 20% hospitalization, still means vast majority needing medical intervention. 20% likely way high America we've likely already 40,000,000+ cases total going 10x theory would bring hospitalization % way down. We've went less 2 billion people 7 billion like hundred years, bit ridiculous imo. it’s cold  course Hey! middlemen insurance companies pay good money bribes ensure keep getting paid!   Yup work American company it’s low paying job made testing free employees even contractors get 2 week paid Covid test positive. think it’s retail industry it’s fucked low pay PTOs people basically forced work even covid.

 say keep make people sick that’s businesses learn PTO take care employees, don’t employees come work make people sick make customers sick. it’s necessary evil. I’m done asking “how people see that”. bunch selfish imbeciles US’s “strategy” holding fingernails vaccinate great, least means investing tons getting vaccine distributed quickly went take car older overweight couple wearing masks chins grinning everyone wearing mask properly. People stupid. Conservatives, like trump much? done make believe good job? Give straight answer bullshit. -Alex Jones entered chat... completely useless metric. Deaths go time. Periods high mortality followed periods low mortality vice versa.
Old people die. Get it. think 100 million people work medical front lines?

The estimated population people 65 years old America 50 million. 

So theoretically end year, could vaccinate majority people highest risk factors front line workers. might lose temper teach person lesson.. hope never see suck thing, sure could keep temper check. Try buy deep freezer. sold NJ NY. lot people stockpiling pictures hospital bed receiving oxygen? Looks like hoax conspiracy making people anger cross line YES actual paper garbage! Complete Microsoft Paint quality figures completely nonsensical Bummer someone sick? God people horrible. Thank you! yes disinfect takeout containers, groceries, etc.  quit too, September 17, 2019. I've quit million times pandemic making easy start again. cnn.com clickbait stop collecting publishing nationwide hospital data stop propagating? Yeah, toxic scientists doctors always trying shove evidence data people's faces!!

LOL @ history ... good luck r/MaskSkepticism crusade. top state unemployment insurance.

Edit: it’s odd unopinionated comments get much hate here. I’m interested personal narrative. Everything I’ve said easily verifiable. 

I still uninterested wasting time someone doesn’t listen. hope payment contingent upon success. really. 

That isn’t much spike compared number infected.

Four times cases less half number deaths time compared 1/4 number cases. 

Growth gradual best. We're returning deposit interest. France outbrakes Spain right now... What's point? 6x bottom, likely higher. They're using confirmed deaths we've seen multiple reports large numbers unreported fatalities occurring. Hello! guys hit 4 mill One side effects covid sick people afraid go hospital. mean, sucks, hey things looking hopeful Oxford, Moderna, Pfizer expecting release vaccines end year, hope last semester ever take online classes. That's actually quite awesome. Thanks link - I'll sharing others. agree you, although time I'm definitely going bar/party/club. almost country colonized legislated radical puritans. I'm Pune. max cases India. Californians, know seems scary, try stay strong &amp; informed. Please wear masks. Love. hate normally really hope everyone smooth sailing survive safely, case consequences terrifying hope gets worse. 

Terrible people make terrible people :&lt;. foreigner probably chance succeed average American. Many Americans drive anymore, maybe got comfortable entitled lives, consumed materialistic things. Got used 9-5, always needing someone tell do.

What motivation one progress everything need? Whats stopping getting loans, opening businesses, working credit, getting education get better job?

Since virus started, New businesses stopped opening. Hotels, Clinics, retirement homes, constructions, keep popping up. American businesses may closing down, foreign investments rising. Social justice equality isn’t essential pandemic?

Guess get rid courts police forces pandemic then!

All people collaborating together unnecessary professions could accelerate spread. mean, based mers vaccine, years behind it. Well, thrown World Health Organization (WHO) pool bad advice givers.      
Way looked was, people mask exporting countries told wear masks. People mask importing countries told opposite.    
I keeping eye S. Korea, shut exports could supply domestic population, pretty much knew story was.    
In way, indictment free trade. top three ‘characteristics’ increases likelihood contracting COVID-19:

* overweight

* asthmatic

* immuno-compromised

Nothing scientifically revised suggested COVID-19 particularly targets specific ethnicity moment. top 78 yesterday. problem amount aerosolized virus ejected air breathing heavily gym. really bad news.

Talking disinfectant sounds like talking different disease, surface contact disease usually spreading.  Sadly, dropped feature S20. Non American - tide finally turning 2nd wave states taking seriously? seems like there’s states enforcing masks today Trump’s endorsement. laws American I’m *desperate* USA get shit together international travel resume Fortune 500 company announced today way request clear masks working hearing-impaired individuals rely lip-reading along listening speech. That's kinda neat. top off, two weeks sick leave even cover complicated nature crisis, even forget lag times testing. happens get sick use time, someone family gets sick needs taken care weeks months later? happens symptoms last longer 2 weeks often moderate cases? happens people exposed multiple times span months self isolate again? 

We're cut country go much longer. gutted order cut legs police saying essentially enforced. want compliance, infer (imply, told correct word) police active enforcement. knows many thousands ignore order might complied sure enforced?  someone supposed going San Diego work leaving next week, comforting headline lmao 20 29? hell I'll believe fuckin see it.

The US Gov seized PPE already paid state governments, handed newly minted corps leadership close friends trump family, ""put open market"" states buy *again*. Often people appear incompetent, really are. Here's age distribution confirmed covid deaths Nordic countries July 21 way, got tired Johan.

Social darwinism finest. Oh you’re amazing yes I’m 43. I’m sorry everything you’re put family. know heartache baby babies baby. heart goes yours, sister. May stay safe all. You’ve given best way talking him, truly wonderful advice greatly appreciate. California doesn’t even higher population density France. on?  opinion right now: Testing great, obvious bad got US. They're putting billions testing. There's lot money, can't give stimulus checks? Instead sacrificing people save economy (people needing work), reopening testing (bad logic, obviously gonna get positives), letting people stay home longer giving stimulus checks (to pay rent) setting good example wearing mask affected countries numbers – showing covid task force briefings projections could been. enabled rampant unemployment homelessness, drug overdoses domestic violence homes, ruining people's lives. even get started contact tracing, nothing justifies tyranny imposed society. function One. thing White House moron p*sses onto wants Americans believe into. realistic assume 500k end year.

I'm US quit got virus, actually smoked coronavirus, open prescription chantix (champix countries) insurance cover wanted $750/month pharmacy..............................I looked assistance/discount programs still $350/mo.

I went ER coronavirus dismay, gave good lecture, gave motivation try finally sent US prescription Canadian pharmacy mailed week later $140 instead $750.....

I problem quitting oxycontin cold turkey 1.5 years prescribed percocet every day, could never kick tobacco without medication. medication works every time, every several years get stressed, worked, lack sleep, gives impulse smoke. I’ll never forget coworkers pressuring attend happy hour bars opened. 

I caved girls wedding cancelled doin civil wedding instead. 

After one time, let asking go happy hour. Fuuuuuck that. felt weird coworkers laughing assess without mask, waiter filled decked PPE. 

It uncomfortable hell. Never again! don’t see problem adding TEXAS that? Texas has, what, 1/3 population density France? see people without masks rare occasion (and person shopping house now), others give pretty wide distance (easily 20 ft). Greetings Munich. 

We still wear masks stores, subway, entering restaurants bakeries crowded places. People great number disciplined put others. restaurants, leave name, time visit telephone number, notify something comes up. 

Kids go schools, classes separated two groups visit school different days kids sit maintaining right distance. 

Overall, discipline word day personally never seen angry Karen protesting rights violated. 

I hope USA manages pull through, even shit-for-brains president.  Looking like another 1,000+ states I’m trying pretend covid-19 isn’t serious risk. is. report massively obese woman prior symptoms dying covid-19 blatantly false click bait. weight alone host potential life threatening complications would could end life tomorrow. Sans covid-19. may call coronavirus situation intent kill, best intentions native americans living rainforest, LGBT+ people... less reported right Well Batman batshit crazy constituents.

So guess Florida going get even Floridamanish. Better keep Governors mansion tours closed permanently. PA Ohio often comparable. He's actor stage. even care really matter. sure $100 week much helpful $0 week...like even bother dont think made federal law like seatbelts. go go state state. Bay Area two deaths early February, couple weeks first known death Seattle. learn COVID next weeks months data death toll, asymptomatic cases, etc become clearer.

 little early Capitol's Fall Karen Festival. absolutely right. economists 100% agreement other, way scientists are.

You disagree me, make ad hominem attacks.  reads like serious science denialism masqueraded common sense. Conveniently dodging main point stroking FHI, top fixation one person instead many many societal institutional issues contributed 5.6k deaths.

Your way thinking polar opposite self image. psychology cult member. Good question. I've noticed changed numbers afterwards.

78504 correct number, question 132?      

Today, daily update [a hours numbers Jul 21 78,166.       
After they've updated, numbers Jul 21 changed (sorry, little blurry). daily numbers changed too.      
So, know. Maybe official site made correction (worldometers) made change notify.  straight delusional 6 times deadlier bottom estimate. extrapolation get number cases. problem number confirmed deaths (like number confirmed cases) also accurate. means true IFR somewhere north 0.58% they're calculating based confirmed deaths. get onboard watch communities ravaged world things, albeit restrictions precautions. think army would want inform someone like context/situation there, hazards may come vaccinating people... nah, biggie. here, FLA. week schedule week results.

-Donald Trump, September 2020 yes pretty sure person replying sincere seen lot people say since schools shut school shootings corona getting close eradicating Guinea Worm, though recent setback discovered new reservoirs. still hope eradicating decade. 

Malaria eradication probably theoretically achievable holy grail, skeptical ever get since require much cooperation.  mum recover senses? Hahahaha US better flu vaccination rates Europe. person intelligent person

No, aren’t. 🖖😷  mean got flu vaccine year still got flu California alone higher average population density France. 

Combine California Texas people France. 

Yet combined still many less deaths France. Well sure things always better. Nothings perfect. helps perspective. say Americans poor suggest average American poor, isn’t true. Americans poor certainly fix that. average American better average country something fundamental structure America allows average person better anywhere else. There’s also something fundamental allows poverty higher many developed countries. It’s possible fix latter preserving former, you’re likely convince people get board articulate way. Interesting, would never know live. went local Walmart afternoon sign said “masks encouraged” people actually wearing them. literally don’t want wear This. chance actually make impact, wish washy approach trying lure people who’ve lost concern interest back isn’t going work. point people areas plan enforce mask will, rest won’t. 

If anything looks rather effectiveness. know headline says, call bullshit this. recall congresswoman berrated person significance health insurance / health industry agreeing allow testing COVID free. understand testing anything free. would believe Pfizer going try profit like tomorrow vaccine? much easily keep distance gym restaurant though, disinfectant everywhere, also require wearing masks measures like limiting number people easily want to. might go quiet gym literally want understand hate gyms get Reddit. country almost everyone back work normally still work home, gym mental health would complete mess. would apply countries. fact, would probably apply countries got hit hard early, bigger spikes, meant less bandwidth supplies testing. Thanks letting catch hundreds salmon shores Vancouver island, Canada. Canadian's super friendly. I'll back one day catch many more! Yummy!! last 14 days Texas, confirmed cases went 7,400 day 9,500 day. Deaths went 47 per day 117 per day. exponential growing concerning rate.

Exponential growth might happen zero restrictions compliance safety...regardless though, things looking good Texas.

Another note Texas, test results delayed 1-4 weeks many reports. numbers currently seeing likely weeks ago. Also, deaths reported confirmed positive test TX, may extra long delay reporting deaths well, people reported knows long die pending covid test. mean exact thing true flu disease. Hell, even non-diseases. percentage everyone tries peanut butter die previously unknown peanut allergy. Everything degree risk. 

Our best models indicate coronavirus twice deadly flu. worth taking seriously? Definitely. worth throwing planet global recession disrupting fabric entire society? Probably not. compromise needs reached allows people live normal lives common sense modifications. everyone wear masks, don’t big music festivals sporting events, mindful social distancing there’s vaccine. think that’s reasonable compromise people get behind. But, know, makes good scary headline. Yes. Morocco Hey doomers numbers Texas stabilizing say?

Dropping one day stabilizing Using logic nothing manufactured ever free, pedantic reason. I’ve never wanted someone’s ass kicked coronavirus badly. isn’t, I’m afraid won’t take seriously fear lives Brazilians. basically extra two weeks FMLA? Based Trump's past comments, we'll lucky watered Clorox. protesters wear masks. anecdote true protests weddings. saw plenty events with/without masks. Less 50% average places. Literally Google ""BLM protests"" people videos pictures masks...

Literally changing facts now.

Must hard single original thought head.

Yeah, terrible narrative have, virus political!

The virus pick choose, did. illiterate fuckwit. crappy reference. Ignore accomplishments heard someone else bring moon landing. *very slow clap understand it* researched Spanish flu all? You’d shitting pants lived it. government bad. Maybe eradicated vaccine hopefully it’s big concern. Like polio measles. Yes outbreaks wide scale moment 68 confirmed cases.

(and name club ""Techtle Mechtle"" slang word secret/not public sexual relationship.) Remember, republicans want civil immunity corporations kind thing. doubt Springfield following suit. Mr. Burns probably payed Super Nintendo Chalmers. follow trail like. i'm sure entirely picked conversation yes original comment allow face shields felt uncomfortable breathing mask.  Okay I'm one He's obviously American People reduced productivity cows, milked others benefits superficially labeled ""heroes"". like hostages. especially scary people still infect others asymptomatic. okay, I'm sure everyone stay home avoid traveling large parties holiday season. 
 /s We’re #1 We’re #1 We’re #1. right now... still national plan scale capacity fucking July five months pandemic lol. best time plant tree probably February, next best time today. I’m 32 married children, friends don’t really “party” hard days. It’s hard really grasp scale thing literally know 0 people it. lot friends starting get together things wife really strict. weird thing consider bit raging narcissist, want things like Covid taken seriously us taking precautions that's protect me. can’t even come close making claim. Home made masks extremely effective. standard surgical mask. depends entirely design. least effective surgical masks.

You flat god damn wrong. masks significantly reduce risk. significantly reduce amount droplets expelled amount reach mouth nose others. Substantially so. LabCorp sounds like evil company comic book. Ya don’t say Okay, I’ll bring Tex Mex join know elderly could still children. /s Asymptomatic people definition die. alley usually paved area buildings, often narrow, enough room one car travel one way. usually considered private property, shared relevant buildings, like driveway parking lot. common urban areas. cul-de-sac public street, usually space two way traffic, (even though out) parking sides, often enough width end make U turn without using reverse. common suburban residential areas. better cover perform real vaccination drive also try get DNA samples?

But run risk actually benefiting someone process.  problem shouldn’t wish type ill anyone. Someone might agree views wouldn’t want say someone love. better. Worth noting NYC data suggest 1.2% death rate include confirmed + suspected covid-related deaths.

Antibody tests suggest 23.2% NYC'ers infected. confirmed probable covid-deaths / (23.22 % * 8,399,000) = 1.2%

Presumably much difference b/c 'probable' deaths (~20% total) plus impact higher death rate hospitals overrun prior learning better treatment methods. truly breaking intergenerational social contract ""let old people die"". treat elders way would like treated we're old. fuck restaurants allowed people dining medic army would give polio vaccines locals. Never knew feat so.

Thank sharing. I'm sorry things done deceive offering help. shameful. dumb comment. declining wonderful, peak also insane. goal though, lockdown, basic measures, would result high death rate onset slower thereafter. ever another peak though strategy proven wrong. scandi countries catch sweden's death rate, sweden proven right. yes friends make fun it. also think ridiculous re-package go delivery heat safe. not? really much trouble best keep family safe. top echelon YouTubers can. Good ! I'm glad ! amazing, went effort zero pushups can’t open schools. Follow damn guidelines get semblance normal Even hospitalised still feel take seriously recovering. data provided shows kids 23.2% state, account ~10% cases. indicates kids less likely diagnosed. could due kids less likely tested, could due less likely get infected Listen long john, face shields shields protect others well effective mask. I'm sure getting information visor without mask absolutely helps certain effective is. definitely better nothing better mask.

your edit would similar comment face shield cloth covering tied around bottom. i'm sure readily available hazmat masks are.  real Sophie's Choice.  shame neither democrats replublicans vote that. Theres difference anti-vaxxers people wary rushed vaccine though. people see people getting safe, 40% drop. Rushed vaccines nice side effects before. Well least good mutates ZOMBIE apocalypse!!!  take enjoying death suffering?

Most recently [hour third world shithole? WTF about.

[here mocking dead Americans think they're think they're superior really debating things even said.


I've linked directly need try deny it. Sort shit out. Beyond paying fair share taxes distributed assist small business, big business zero obligation help small business. less competition better them. buy smaller businesses. Since supposed prop competitors? lol I’ve fairly surprised, seen go Biden felt fine virus. 

It’s bit afterwards puts arse. 

And context, I’m healthy, young, access amazing healthcare. long term effects virus, 4 months later, still ruined me. Took long enough latest Government excuse controlled it.

The lies world govts began January never stopped.
It started “Masks don’t work” 90% country believes whatever says. well truly fucked, ladies gentlemen.  citation that? 12,800 new positive cases day. Still maintaining 7.5% positive rate last two weeks. ICU hospitalizations uptick.  Nope, get steal Canadian valor. “Sucks risk people! economy must go on” hope someone answers seriously. actually could end happening? Even vaccine? People position organize. people refuse come office reasonably replace short notice, cave allow WFH, long refusal come coordinated... Read FAQ:    

And   
   
And lol sure exactly CIA Tuskegee, AL(fake vaccines)? citizens.

It syphilis, bacteria, vaccines were/could involved. yes, told African American patients treated, gave ineffective drugs study spread disease.

Fun Fact, illegal experiment 90% cut back quarantine. feeling like long time, always something coming gave excuse to. every social event cancelled gave drinking 100% home too. felt like things opened back events started happening again, would eventually easier abstain one drink already hadn’t drinking month 2. Otherwise, always easy say, “whatever, I’ll quit time.” 
After 2 weeks, didn’t even care anymore. Yeah used go Victoria's Secret ask try bras watch staff get uncomfortable try discreetly close changing rooms punk teenager. sign pineapple loving shirt! lol. No, certainly adds share shit pile. Well that’s fascist playbook. trust people around trump much smarter actually hurts designs brain genius. yeah I’m actually fucking morons probability too. Underestimating enemy bad move Could easily government. aya wine commercial craptastic

my friend's mom overcome pneumonia--caused covid. passing away. Covid real? GFY No, people put power sure shit southern US fire non-discriminatory reason

remember every november Yes, however, there’s serious deviation cannot write way around, won’t released. I’ve exact scenario. interesting much gets pushed shouldn’t. rush nature vaccine manufacturers something take lightly. Uh oh Natural way increase nitric oxide: factories take months build plan. need machines make masks. People need make machines. People needed build factories. lock late that.

Airlines employ millions people. airlines go down, people lose jobs. leads depression America needs people working keep economy working. want million unemployed, airlines compete countries.

Factories built home soil. everything China model failed. . exactly see someone walking without mask think trying spread it! numbers Tokyo 3 weeks ago.

And places things common:
- Dense population
- enforced measures control spread
- Lack testing/tracing/isolation Seems like side effects (called adverse effects AE's) relatively mild. commonly observed AE asymptomatic transient increases uric acid (12 patients Favipiravir treatment arm zero control arm); resolved first follow up. Gastrointestinal disturbance minimal clinically significant differences observed treatment groups. downvoting comment shows fixated negatives everyone really is. possible covid bay Christmas recent vaccine news. Since parts country shutting again, people self-isolating, would expect jobless numbers reverse recent trend start INCREASING Covid gets back control. Reverse batman know like 4 different groups people vacationing Arizona California last weeks. One group destination wedding Arizona families live city Washington State... one confused me. Fuck people. die, directly fault, family able sue her.  4 months get ready this. Hahahaha..

Say person can't read lol sound like need hug !remindme 1 hour ""check /u/Derek275 deleted comment"" Better late never guess No. effective vaccine would enable society operate normally. Results promising. disease never gone. Negligence reckless endangerment obviously. one dies, involuntary manslaughter? said rock hard place comes coroanvirus spreading rampantly poor people need work survive forget vitamin zinc already? heard doctor Houston say last night worried shortage dialysis machines, many covid patients needing them, really running havoc kidneys too.  grandmother stay can't wear mask, stay catches kill her.

The goes anyone condtion. Dont tests need processed pretty quickly accurate? genius.... /s Huh... even Bible calls non functional human :'( Right, point eradication table beginning, lay-people unfortunately operating POV actually think trying eradicate it. surprising since public health messaging incredibly poor.

Personally - belief almost never visit sub people respond well - believe SARS-2 already mild enough virus could live life without *any* artificial slowing spread totally fine societal level. (Exceptions care taken elderly care facilities aka nursing homes, course, I'm talking general population here).

Thus insofar universal masking, social distancing, etc effective reducing spread, view bad thing.

The real damage inevitable result SARS-2 rather somewhat predictable result unprecedented non-evidence-based measures employed combat it. essence, reacted papercut amputating hand.

Alright, feel free jump :) What’s matter non orange trump? Little case little flu ? definition ""spreading misinformation"". Schools reopening totally separate issue, think pretty obvious assume schools remote, things going get fucked, can't say ""cases doubled"" try make point, absolutely false. jackass Texas tested positive home state, decided vacation would ""help feel better,"" took family Oregon. He's currently hospitalized disease got worse honestly hope fucking dies. Fuck people deliberately putting others risk traveling pandemic- ESPECIALLY ones knew positive covid. Fuck them.  telling going magically disappear??? population plummets, unemployment \*taps head knowingly\* go get fucked, I'm done entertaining you. REPEAT ME: MASK FACE SHIELD THING.  Let guess believe boogeyman antifa blame everything also don’t you? There’s reason folks never taken seriously. Adorable really (my partner I) quit too!

Great job! niceeeeee I'm sorry, have, feel bad it/him/her regardless gender mean expect do? lives paycheck paycheck living 16 others, 11 kids, think 2 weeks working option

But know let's make assumptions Health issues ruin people financially, time. case made choice take people her. Hell yeah that's personal. even think education mental health key. basic human empathy that's lacking. yeah taught kids either. would right work will. Union employers abide right work hiring. also at-will join union. first three days stay-at-home orders, really strict respecting quarantine nic-fits started. went corner store, always full homeless people, bought loosie. guy handed cigarette bare hands, took thought ""this stupid"" threw thing went outside.

Haven't smoke since March 14th. Happy Cake Day.

It's conceivable people mild symptoms asymptomatic build robust t-cell response, never produce antibodies. immune system many viruses. Boo hoo, cite source, grow f up. happy prove stats, whine like little girl.

I mean, immature username like that, expect less, amirite? oh shit CA beat TX. AZ FL.....

Shit Yeah, I'm NJ seeing what's happening elsewhere sad watch unfold. blueprint what's working isn't. Things working nothing screeching anti-mask pointing NY/NJ death totals way show better. hell going accomplish? comparing part country contains densely populated state right next one densely populated cities see lot international travel also hit initially states saw happen months-long period facing potential tragedy? fucking serious? anti-intellectualism lack interest investing education definitely come serious problems within country need addressed. 

And one Northeast, especially hard hit areas, say handled perfectly here. obvious negative nursing homes. But, adapted made changes stabilized things, now. easy point people done incorrectly, especially fact. primary area focus obviously learn mistakes focus done correctly implement changes. thought basic simple understand. people continuously prove wrong. carry pandemic? 

And always joy seeing people last took biology course high school concrete definitive statements handle mitigate spread virus. actual scientist (more chemistry based), super enjoyable see people science field gone school least 4 years, also experience area, ignored people even pass basic biology exam. 

All all, hope things get better, like do. would love wrong bad going places like Florida (opening fast + upcoming hurricane season + lack leadership) am, fucking awesome. would never cheer people dying continue ridiculous dick measuring contest that's happening. reason depend filters redirect air though (hopefully someone else downvoted BTW haha)

I downvote you, undeniably see/saw instances local ICU hitting capacity, problem solved shuffling patients nearby ICU/hospital capacity.

We're seeing much larger levels local ICUs. Arizona's statewide ICU capacity 85% full weeks now. Texas Medical Center, largest medical center US, half ICU beds Texas, 100% capacity week.

That two states restrictions place slow spread. closed bars limited restaurant capacity, addition theaters, concerts, sporting events, etc, closed.

I'm sure ICUs states completely overwhelmed measures taken slow spread? Since taking large measures prevent spread *still* led nearly maxing ICUs.

Also, ICUs staffed real people, fatigue, burn out, get sick themselves. Even ICU that's 100% capacity running sustainable level. can't expect ICU staff handle 90% full ICU months end. American educational system also allows leftist guess probably varies state state.

Now that's pretty big contradiction there, bud.   might need help guy. exactly .. exactly predicted Stocks conning average Joe invest rich tank market take Joe's money forget Pastor Pence going town Friday force Holcomb opening schools. disagree, narcissists generous. sharing coronavirus. ignoring whole part black people likely worse credit score saying white person living poverty higher credit score based color skin?

No. literally said nothing like you’re saying.

I literally explained meant twice now. see reason keep wasting time you. You’re listening. ""Congregate Corona"" voluntarily exchange labor prices set. boogeymen bosses set wages accoeding market values low skill easy replace workers. I'm going pretend world particularly nice just, need stop pretending people agency perpetually victims. yes. California alone bigger population density France. 

So regard France still fails.  knowledge deadly, uncontrollable disease wreaking havoc thousands deaths daily, constant fear losing relatives illness, daily anticipation get deathly ill yourself, knowledge hospitals overwhelmed able safely get medical care possible problem god knows long, constant fear virus company/employment/future career/economy, lack hope ending end sight, real prospect bankrupcy eviction crippling debt health consequences possibly one's entire life, inability safely work - anyone crippingly depressed anxious given circumstances??? I'm amazed anyone functioning mentally paralyzed.

Given reality what's happening, lockdown social-isolation stress tiny tiny grain sand top - even major cause depression anxiety.

They say hybrid requires childcare OK remote option.... also requires childcare, right? saying 100% remote force parent stay home thus solve childcare problem (while causing economic problems). ok.

But time, supporting administration sending secret police abduct, beat, prosecute people rallying I. Portland. 


How people see hypocrisy here? I'm Huntington Beach. Halp. Squeal lahk pig  Wow that’s insane mean here? lockdowns effective, that's entire point. places bars, restaurants gyms allowed re-open, COVID cases shot way up.

And three weeks ago almost everyone sub saying much. Maybe I'm misunderstanding point here?     concur. mouthful broken teeth needed implants able chew food again. insurance rejected claim unnecessary ""cosmetic"" surgery. Cost $30,000 me, took years pay off. 

Guess next time I'll gum toast nubs. Elections pandemic: precaution countries held elections? people quarantine voting? Czech minister interior said absolutely way quarantined people vote (we correspondent electronic vote). public outrage speaking ""finding way postponing elections"". Every downturn excuse make cuts regardless workload. I'm growth industry every company market even ""good"" ones froze salaries. \*\*sigh\*\*

Of course Paul brothers.

I really wish YouTube would demonetize kick platform. already laundry list reckless dangerous behavior aggravating kids teens look two idiots epitome success idolize them.

They danger others, tactless seem care themselves. Step one: send kid back die. He's second major world leader contract virus. feel matter time someone high-level government position succumbs virus.  Yes, every person infected immune drops R. 25% people immune, R drop somewhere around 50% due population heterogeneity (estimates vary widely magnitude effect).  can’t really expect people go work sick don’t provide disability / sick pay...

It shitty person this, alternative might homelessness... like pro-mask group complete saints.

Sorry, I'll courteous drunk drivers people smoke indoors around others too. nightmare scenario - realistic, *expected*. world COVID we've collectively relatively myopic views, looking forward next weeks next months. Partly know little hard make long-range predictions. also *want* look far ahead fear may see. 
 
All predictive models look far Oct. 1st Nov. 1st. almost curves (at least US) show curve bending upwards end chart. happens Nov. 1st? like curve suddenly going turn sharply downwards - see number cases, hospitalizations deaths curving upwards November, December, January. make Summer living right seem like rosy ""better times"" period comparison. 
 
I see hospitals clinics filled people trying determine ""do flu? virus?"" flu season ramps up. 
 
I see many people virus recovered, even realize sick suddenly struggling hard catch flu. realizing lungs damaged months earlier ""crushed glass lungs"" can't keep up. Normally would able shake common flu, health compromised, easy.  
 
Good god, going clusterfuck. try maintain semblance optimism avoid debbie-downer, man hard sometimes. Locking society? 

Most places suffering right didn’t begin with.

I get you’re likely trolling there’s time place. people people inside Costco walking people restaurant what’s causing spikes?

Talking, eating, drinking close death rate down,

Your talking point week date. Deaths shooting again, exactly predicted Surprisingly, evidence lockdowns effect spikes pretty skanty.

No, started staying home wearing masks mandatory.

And without mandates wear masks stay home, lot people leading much slower decline cases much higher deaths.

You really idea talking about. US thinks breastfeeding bad? way. highly pressured breastfeed. fact hospital gave birth give awards moms breast feed longest. called silver boobies (six months) golden boobies (12 months) platinum boobies (over year). still get mad thinking stigma moms groups nurses bottle feeding gets. lasted less week kid strong healthy formula worked us. still feel guilt decision strangers made feel bad it. longer based stats? 

France arguably worse.  Okey made laught money would give gold literal puppet childish adult. Someone know said thought would go away November. made blood boil. Trivializing people’s pain hardship doesn’t effect personally. self centered attitude. Connecticut greatest wealth disparity country- richest rich mile away poverty. Even Greenwich CT poor people- call “the servants quarters.” It. Is. A. Pipe. Dream.

He absolutely pack go home. 690 cases, 7 deaths, triple spoke 60 days ago. sure think though, I’m reading much flawed numbers FL true, people end drawing whatever conclusion feel like. dangerous. Kicking screaming....and wrong. Wow, almost like there's cure something. Hmmm appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Thank god time. Even though basically everyone county wears one stores, needed. That's problem states solve. national problem. state manage without national strategy, unless go full quarantine travelers Hawaii style. twat also access best healthcare given he's world leader....comparing treatment recovery us plebes quite try make amends? No, quite opposite really. pandemic, people higher degree contact others higher chance infected. immune, also play outsized role preventing spread. herd immunity pandemic lower (by somewhere 2 4 times) herd immunity achieved via word mean think does. Oh young naive again. 

Once kids (unless support network dump kids into) quickly realize longer work nights weekends. social circle like - aren’t people working take time drop kids case emergency. flex. come hard reality one take time care kidmergencies, simply take time make daycare drop pick up. 

Sure, may try make work you, sleepless nights stretch weeks months years one two kids, exhaustion set - You’ll prioritize one person’s long hours others least one person move forward career type nothing world live America.

Whomever makes better benefits usually stays employed. reasons lot long entrenched sexism usually guy.  end one spouse career gets suburb nice school system, career long hours weekends business trips frequent moves spouse gets dumped bullshit child care house care general emotional care baggage organizing everyone family’s life scrounging part time benefits flexible hours contract work. 

It’s one partner “selfish prick”, it’s reality working life America without grandma grandpa’s extra help. 

But one ever said life fair. Maybe countries different? still waiting. deaths less. They're 21,000 deaths less. Yeah, blinded.

What's even point Phase III like point? Especially drug countries skeptical of. can’t believe getting downvoted. drove around town yesterday counted 18 shops gone outta business. Like, well could 18 families lost Someone getting sick good. Losing livelihood isn’t good either. Govt supposed provide security failed fronts.

I obviously agree you. Glad there's common sense forum.

I wonder even browse sometimes. People legitimately think realistic lock forever. maddening. world broken irrelevant accepts not. covered least hundred thousand times Reddit elsewhere. anyone still thinks ""denial results"" keeps office beyond me...keep people, Trump dictator SCOTUS Congress able help hole Oval Office recounts.  could lose pounds, say thick.

More seriously, would study? someone explain gyms put level restaurants bars? require people wear mask gym easier distance limit occupancy like countries Europe (at least initially), also disinfectant everywhere least easily protect going bar club. see next comes spread risk. fair live much , much Pacific times find hard believe flyover States exist. Let's stop reading travelling hey everyone?

Edit- wait, hold actually early morning here. Let's definitely stop travelling scratch that. Let's stop learning experiences outside own.  getting reports everyday decisions kill thousands people

By buying meat, decisions kill plenty sentient (i.e. reaction pain do) beings too. imagine sleeping night knowing feeling nothing? 

Yes. Rationalizations, apathy, narcissism. Humans plenty mechanisms either deny existence of, ignore justify 'problems'. He's treating *others* like *others* treat **others**. .0001% IFR

But “estimate” several months behind current data, yes? don’t see CDC data linked. 

Updated data IFR United States. Researchers estimate overall infection fatality rate (IFR) 1.45 percent New York City, March 1-May 16, 2020—in words, 1 2 percent New Yorkers infected COVID-19 including mild symptoms died period. new estimate double IFR previously reported elsewhere (e.g., 0.7 percent China France IFR estimates come from). far, IFR U.S unclear. new study finds mortality risk highest among older adults, IFR 4.67 percent 65-74-year-olds 13.83 percent 75+ year-olds. Younger people far lower chances dying disease: 0.011 percent among younger 25 0.12 percent among 25-44-year-olds. However, risk young people taken lightly, especially given cases post-infection Multi-system Inflammatory Syndrome Children, researchers caution. New York City among complete reliable data COVID-19 deaths—specialists review death certificates rapidly record deaths unified electronic reporting system. reason, new estimate likely accurately reflects true higher burden death due COVID-19. Further, given likely stronger public health infrastructure healthcare systems New York City many places, higher IFR estimated new study suggests mortality risk COVID-19 may even higher elsewhere United States, likely countries well. Merkel pose! ""I've dying see new movie..."" That's PCR tests. antibody tests early unregulated ones high false positive rate, would trigger common cold antibodies. may also false negatives, survey change numbers much. view best. really bad specificity. instance one that's 91% specific would never tell fewer 9% population antibodies. 

Legit academic studies would always account calibrating test applying bayesian reasoning approximate true number. many studies so. Indiana may number ever saw published percentage, high likelihood true number lower. thinking, too. really expected trough big wave fall. summer surge sort unprecedented carries additional problems - lot people going see big surge think ""surely, must closing herd immunity?"" truth is, US whole probably 7-15% range still. 15% national average infections highly optimistic, too. take infections we've date multiply 4-6+. could experience fall. that's covid19, flu included. really idea flu going play this.

I really hope occur way, I'm concerned huge surge fall dwarfs current situation. plenty uninfected people happen. Agreed. Hopefully people recognize getting fiscal support need local leadership, though I'm sure story spun attempt deflect blame Governor Wolf. resign, people vote morons Netherlands example uses excess deaths. not. result comparison two data points measuring different numbers pointless. Yes! That’s it. Thanks exactly. i’m advocating people get infected they’re immune, saying there’s enough sound research either side make definite claim that’s absolutely zero medical professionals made claim.

This regardless you’re “immune” body going better prepared fight virus off.

This pure speculation. thank you! barriers up, assume traffic flow pretty consistant.  would too. Can't blame one 40, thin, toothless people assume meth addict. get REAL tired that, masks nobody tell really real. YES, omfg. I've seen many fucks.

Sadly [is indoor restaurant high? someone explain differs church party? exactly needed today, hell yes! Fear not. Us peons still needed robots come online. told us today masks good idea. Right dude.

Errr... that’s true, what’s purpose telling people that?  Well, sounds like doctor wasn’t exposed hospital environment. partner returned vacation Texas March, believe caught then. returned work, felt dizzy, promptly went home self-isolated. partner tested found positive asymptomatic throughout. That's going major problem starts affect people driving, operating machines, responsible people's safety. really hope that's chronic symptom.  Best luck. lives statistics, loved people friends, family support system. could parents, could next-door neighbours. raw numbers. think we’re 4/5 per capita? positive though take 2 weeks process places really need ?. like pro-COVID side saying...yes infections rates rising need look death rates!

This 100% due shitty newsmedia industry elevated disinformation scamming level longer possible Americans rational discussion come democratic consensus anything.  far, worse plague coronavirus, I'd posit worse pretty much disease we've faced civilization. No, saying current antibody titer indicative immune response. Memory B cells also cells play part. unreasonable think might well get 1-3 years immunity. means bundle flu shot. 

A isolated cases reinfection scary necessarily mean anything population. Think women get multiple chicken pox vaccines eventually give mount immune response. exist, big deal everyone else gets vaccinated protects them. sister told Sky Ranch (mentioned article) giving refunds, one niece's friends went since already paid for.  Many people pay throughout year since camps cost thousands $$$. US much bigger country much vocal anti vacinee minority Like many said, Trump correct virus go away--when dead. Again, that's PCR tests. antibody test. Damn, he's like fascist Fidel Castro. wash everything goes Uh Oxford vaccine good early results definitive findings late next year. Okay antivaxxer. really think President one researching vaccine? No, scientists devoted lives studying viruses medicine. I'd trust them. entirely free public around globe effective, shared free manufacturers elsewhere necessary mean that's really argument people making. argument increase testing causing increase **detected** cases. still wrong, something keep mind better look positivity rate together raw case numbers. WA recently detecting cases first peak also testing 4x much back hospitalizations, positivity rate, deaths still then. I'm glad someone actual study, cognitive dissonance would allow people believe truth seems obvious rest us. I’m special ed assistant school 1400. Wish luck, friends! Reminds 90's Animated Batman series. Messing around Bat dna became bat. knows goes underground labs. Something something, herd immunity...

This always stupid people even talk ""herd immunity"" 'strategy'. enough data available yet lets go ahead get schools open get data (Deaths)!! worries. Yes still see heaps people cold/flu symptoms get sent testing/isolation completely well.  Yeah one silver lining pandemic seems virus scared bejeezus people quitting smoking.  blindly believe politicians say big deal. seen article Dr's experience patient getting it, testing negative twice getting again, worse second time. peer reviewed studies yet seen. Give time, friend.  No. 

I’m saying claim Sweden sacrificed 5000 lives economy didn’t lockdown, logic must dictate every country person engages economy sacrifices lives every year economy hundreds thousands could saved taking exact actions claim Sweden taken. 

So Sweden sacrificed economy 5000 lives one sacrifice economy lives flu victims? 

Why lives important others? EU provide global security. US military dominance Air waves still fact. China off-hand territory US since WWII. militarily nothing changed.

The problem world one benefits US ravishing economy, society healthcare system. EU. China. country. Economies interwoven everybody suffers.

I agree stance US lost lot foreign policy standing. Close allies like Bolsonaro's Brazil Indonesia received flights vaccines test PRC. Bolsonaro Trumps ideological brother. Indonesia traditional anti-communist bulwark state. PRC sent aid relief teams lot countries even EU member states like Italy. Meanwhile USA unable unwilling get anything done. Remember negotiations. Republicans need Democratic backing since party split issues. Start extreme ends ending middle. Yeah - school either 5 days week person, 5-days week 'google classrooms' 8-3. remote option simply work first grader. cannot expect 6 year old sit watch lessons computer screen 7 hours. Americans hate America. It’s rampant Reddit. also prat shit job. middle east isnt turmoil overthrow dictators every often. middle east trouble countries dont want conform rapidly changing world makes real relations developed countries difficult, becomes us vs game everyone takes sides causes chaos. 

If people overthrow dictator beliefs create dictatorship, course end with.

All jokes aside, seen anything making mutate resistant. Everything I've seen mutates super slowly makes less terrifying. source? No, think are. Lowe’s massive store good air flow, little confined spacing, ample hand sanitizing stations per store. Wearing mask keeping distance almost entirely voids chance contact. taking appropriate precautions around unmasked people, exposure risk extremely low.

On hand, conforming customer trying get store puts close contact person, also risk escalation causing injury. It’s worth all. work banking, use math lot. also loved math school, found stuff like polynomials fun even took extra math stuff electives. math learned (and even still asked) purpose practical use. concepts taught need put elective courses saved higher learning people made conscious decision go fields knowledge required. Let’s use K-12 ensure basics mastered. it’s math top head, Callum Hudson-Odoi Chelsea Paolo Dybala Juventus it. hate idea absolutely nothing going still *something*. office pretend busy even there’s literally nothing time

I feel much better without manager hovering like hawk home ""Covid marathon sprint."" 
That hear Swedish authorities every then.

But better start running fall asleep already start line. literally everyone know gone vacation quarantined coming back areas pa says quarantine after. nc, fl, tx... there’s everybody going shore, posting boardwalk mask pics. folks healthcare workers! makes insane. god forbid get theirs.

Covid-19 long con get eat vegitables? Good. time fuck around “Why *let* *wash country*?” Wear mask, social distance, wash hands. Like people angry stock market, clearly know nothing it. 

The stock market represents investors think business' performance like 12-24 months now. vaccine within 24 months probably much sooner. depends testing capacity, countries hit 100k already easily.

You're right. countless studies accuracy utility. say think man invented said so.

Lmao well guess logical argument gone proverbial window mean, might tiny. know what's tiny? Every conspiracy theorist cell phone type shit on... already got tracking devices. people dumb enjoy disingenuous. govenor tied local officials hands cannot shut yet blames increase. lieutenant govenor said things important living. So...we're fucked. recently read people using bee venom help treat lyme disease. it’s pretty wild kinda claim it’s helping get lives back. see something communication Chernobyl West Germany France...Turns lot things done beginning covid19 outbreak. Basically:
- West Germany 1986: yes good idea stay inside...the cloud here. Tell truth, Germans handle it.
- France 1986: cloud stopped boarder = know ... France March 2020: use mask know use dangerous = enough mask Tell lie, Frenchs handle it. Gaggle idiots looking edgy. hope police start tossing fines like confetti gatherings.

Edit: Unfortunately, due number uncivil comments, thread locked. And, boy, social media “friends” high school pissed it! It’s disease highly contagious specific scenarios. studied extensively know transmits, know transmits extremely poorly outdoors.

Do though? Source? Top scientists following keep becoming surprised outbreaks occur. still significant risk. One person gets it, spreads like wildfire. 50,000 people, least several hundred guaranteed carriers.

Plus walkway areas inside stadiums restrooms, concessions, merch things are? Everyone gonna properly protected? Throw alcohol mix... kills you.

But least I’m gonna take anyone else like assholes. Yep goofed

To fair admitted read go away every human infected. It’s possible, it’s scary think permanent damage. pneumonia lungs pleurisy 2011c took full 6-8 weeks return normal. I’m approaching 120 days Covid I’m still symptomatic. comes goes I’m honestly terrified permanent lung damage. natural infection, far, shown antibodies may last months people got infected recovered immune system antibodies, cells, remember virus years come, b cells, produce antibodies, needed.

plus vaccines tend provide stronger immune response. **If trend continues.** absolutely nothing worry about. Americans world-renowned caring standing united. mean, can't keep food down? could care less care atleast little.
Or couldnt care less? Something something reading comprehension, education failed who?

A lot people would died doctors dead. Theres perfect solution unwinnable situation. prefer government protect doctors paying citizens stay home ever US doing. exactly US doing? There's someone side?!?  experiences countless doctors anecdotes. get wear mask, also providing silly arguments are. confusing. 

Plus, much proof need? pro mask people need make YouTube videos? believe anything proven, one prove them? mum England scared quit smoking knows she'll get awful cough while. smoked whole life plus we're talking nearly 40 years :/ 

Am going scour thread tips hopefully convince kick habit finally Lmao really dumb? get it. take upvote. Proud, made stranger smile yet demonstrating basic lack reading comprehension regards guy's comment. Cool cool cool. Opens google maps: ""bars near me"" pretty sad people real death rate 1.5%, still 10x higher basic flu. Plus studies showing huge long term side effects. Okay, posted (and thanks stalking post history way) realizing came out, mean way. apologize that, trying type quickly realize implying (I since deleted line post)

My point attempting say really wanted follow mandates would keep people safe, would less inclined believe based behavior showing me. baby people wearing one, actually answer concerns genuine ones, trying get wearing one. Right now, people seeing sources saying masks sole way combat virus. outlet toxic people subreddits are.

Take you, instance. know pissed continuing challenge you. instead debate facts, could presenting calm manner, chose scrub post history try find posted something r/maskskeptism (which ""safe space"" means; argue sub is) know debate appreciated sides get equal chance heard (and say r/COVID19 centrist sub sub is, too), found one thing regret phrasing way chose incriminate posting first place, posting one thing knew people would side about. going win anyone side that's try win debate? seen people reacting videos, actual call safety facts figures cross examined put test. might be, numbers exist raises doubts. we're busy talking people actually talk (and saying proves might need it).

But yeah, intention, realized looked say something made look like really give shit anyone's safety, finish sentences (proof might taken back realized even finish sentence would written). Perhaps misunderstood point. article discussed talking testing, antibody testing. 

My point statement false positives correct, much less accurate ideal, also lot false negatives. reinforced referring fact negatives norm certain period infection(I thought standard knowledge doctors recommend waiting test even known exposure reason). 

I’m trying deceive anyone. Perhaps talking different things here. find odd haven’t referenced claims, demanding references criticizing ones provided meeting criteria. Yes, become another h1n1 weakens time large group population’s immune system adapt virus. time next year, likely low death rate like h1n1. Even now, death rate decreasing quite lot, also nowhere near serious h1n1 Spanish flu affecting healthy individuals like Spanish flu did.

At point, there’s point wide shutdowns bars anymore. Mask orders would nice current approach cause less damage. stimulus drying out, similar shut cause harm overall, mention 99.9% chance won’t succeed. Economy take hit certainly better damage shut do, also starvation deaths likely higher shutdowns. think make u r/CoronavirUS capital letters. That's sub now. assuming one it, thereafter immune, seem case. 

&amp;#x200B;

If susceptible re-infection within 3-6 months gotten infection, herd immunity simply possible. I'm saying deserve it, people constantly talk can't trust government big city ""elites""...yet accept facts indicate ""their guy"" trustworthy. Yet California still comparable.  don’t know that. He’s hoping goes away.

He’s got things taking time like golfing (2 rounds past weekend) getting Maxwell shut up. used vape turns get away desk drinking pub. 

Being locked quarantine home drinking beers Friday/Saturday kind naturally stopped. think make distinction total tests done day (102,190) total new tests (54,961) done day. Even post people confused number, making think Florida drastically reduced testing. TIDY Viruses aren’t living things

There’s still nothing alive People confusing vaccine would ready limited emergency use vs doses would ready mass distribution public. 

It’s similar test kits. available February approved emergency use FDA. continue logistics issues 5 months later. We’ve done 50 million tests. really think vaccines go smoothly comparison?

Besides, world record vaccines getting market four years. pessimistic say it’s possible one year? would phenomenal. I’m realist, hopeful one. Trump they'll probably hand bottle lysol wipes he'll shocked amazed created. speaking member MENSA... herd immunity then. Thanks lot wasting time. started entire racism. No, really. Even pre-COVID-19, level wealth already strong predictor health care outcomes. 

34 million people US live poverty, 15.7 million white.

 

Racism cause poverty.

I can't make simpler explained away problematic facts. That's problem living echo chamber, confronted different view point evidence resort I’m interested personal narrative. Everything I’ve said easily verifiable.  still uninterested wasting time someone doesn’t listen. 

I've listened, you? hookers actually affect one's health significantly? STDs? mean short process, there's evidence reinfection yet. full immunity lasts short period (say 1 year so), could become like common cold would essentially impossible eradicate. time got one wave, people would able reinfected, lessening severity. longer term immunity, knows. would eventually fizzle (with vaccine).

The evidence bodies adept fighting things knows fight off. reinfected yearly Covid, body would know fight last year, first infection asymptomatic second put ICU, theory everyone knows fight virus, longer serious threat. That's common cold created essentially. Wednesday....I think.... Things getting worse worse leaders still acting like not. economy keep moving. keep working risk getting sick worse...Its 5 months since virus thing started, cant even believe home long. Sometimes wake wondering Im already dead sometimes check bed body...In context like youre haunting home. Creeps out.

I dont know im downvoted. Im pretty fucking serious here..... agree completely. I’ve tried approach, adamant masks work it’s government (specially Democrats) trying control “scared sheep.”  

One uncles offended social distancing. ranted raved I’m making sacrifices try help. Another friend told government spreading false information, “science” “facts” behind COVID-19 vaccinations untrue basically way big pharma make bunch money poisoning people. I’m losing mind listening them, don’t know get them. get pay for.

I get 12 months outdoor weather, mosquitoes, snow. mortgage beautiful home tech jobs practically grow trees California able pay debt still saving grand every month (more now). also easier get VC funding here.

The trade-off house smaller, bright side, several palm trees entire orchard assorted fruit trees back yard, grow grapes, too.

It'd easy say idiots live Minnesota. ""Down zero"" even. right sorry. 254 per sq mi (CA) France 309 sq mi. 

I see big enough difference showcase France worse hit due though. not. last something positive come mess. open travel two mitigate that? Gather broken logic go fuck home. cherry picked one day cases low cherry picked one day cases high comparison. I’m not.  Fingers crossed! sister laws kids got back boy scout camps, 3 them. incredulous me. Must depend area whether they're canceling not, certainly low Covid rates anyways. theory I've heard Covid rests place lungs nicotine there's nicotine already harder time latching properly. 

I know enough lungs nicotine though know actually makes sense though. I'd rather everyone real, affordable coverage well getting best coverage world, honest. Ahh thanks! half general population two digit IQ, would easily fall fearmongering propaganda.

Like, Trump obviously much worse most, laws predate Trump long time, they've lasted multiple Presidential administrations without ever dismantled. mean work large hospital network lots physician friends. None us experienced this. potentially exposed. sent home work home Thursday. got tested Friday results came Sunday. worked home Tuesday allowed return then. IM friend Wisconsin potentially exposed, sent home work home week tested. us negative tests never symptoms. knew two physicians tested positive sent home quarantine retaliated against. required take sick leave first week allowed work home tested negative. I'm sure people experience horrors they're probably front center reports wrong-doing, experience case places.

Now, definitely shortages PPE places (people given one N95 paper bag, paper bags attached doors). say I've heard plenty of.  way around, safe enough say things wont get better doesnt die. want world leaders die, want things get better. sound like angsty child. Coordinating supplies, emergency production, public health surveillance, funding relief programs, there's even legal groundwork restricting interstate travel might applicable. federal government lot legal power.

The Trump admin using none powers effectively. completely screwed testing early months, spent next months pretending problem would go away, seem focused using pandemic hurt subgroups Americans actually helping issue.

The US worse developed Western nations almost every metric, federal government definitely partly fault. odd. It’s almost exact thing happening watched Italy four months ago New York 2 months ago. could find way slow spread COVID. War foreign nation ensures peace civil unrest, freedom choose poorly leads slavery debt, ignorance facts leads strength one’s convictions. can’t even believe headline exist. 
 
How possible block main authority discussion? would you? (Unless course obvious disdain truth regard people’s wellbeing.)
 
If restaurant somehow power “block” health inspector, would *eat* there?? Welcome back America. missed money. Reducing occupancy help. still 50k+ people small area. know outdoors, there's still concessions, merch, restroom lines, people still congregate together.

My kids restraint half America seems. take reason, indeed chinese medical recommendation so, months ago. Even Europe health ministers planned hoarding states, subsequent studies proved effective. effective, would really cheap medication. think Trump Bolsonaro cling hope consider subsequent studies fake news. taking they're crazy, media often implying. ""They safer disease kills them. cheap hire security."" 


Lowe's corporate. can't spread coronavirus two weeks showing symptoms. presymptomatic, contagious two days prior onset symptoms. Wheres construction work? We've back months, people come  2.8 seems unreliable,its accidental ground false positive rates certain antibody tests.
Aka possible useless research Doesn’t matter many ways prove this. people refusing wear masks, use one many excuses, defend infantile tantrum.

Jail hefty fines (that is, force) thing help situation. read this?

I don’t understand one could identify wearing mask part identity. screams acute insecurity. states like Arkansas, Texas, Alaska, etc. essentially toss-ups right polls, know trouble. still much time election though. even hit conventions yet. campaign even started. There's still plenty time make ground polls. shift like wind country. takes one Biden gaffe. [Relevant article Julia Marcus, epidemiologist professor Harvard Medical School, Jessica Gold, psychiatrist professor Washington University St. much administrators want rely students’ maturity conscientiousness, expectations need realistic. schools requiring on-campus quarantine beginning semester, but—as UConn students agreed—an abstinence-only approach orders students lock dorm rooms would likely fail. Instead, campuses could adopt a harm-reduction approach, successful minimizing unintended consequences behaviors—including sex substance use—in young people. Students told throw parties pandemic, told engage underage drinking campus. universities also acknowledge students going socialize need tools minimize harms—just students drink need free rides need hear they can’t do, also they can do. Although house parties no-go, small outdoor gatherings—especially within social bubbles—are reasonable choice. addition to guidance on ways socialize safely possible, campuses could provide lower-risk alternatives crowded indoor parties: Think movies, yoga classes, concerts—all outdoors social distancing encouraged school-branded masks provided. The Cardinal Nights program at Stanford University uses similar approach reduce drinking campus, providing alcohol-free options socializing—including sports games comedy nights—that divert students higher-risk students need adapt behaviors universities function fall, students solely—or even primarily—responsible keeping campuses safe. Shaming threatening students obstruct public-health efforts. universities want reopen stay open, administrators need adopt compassionate realistic approach supports students staying socially connected mentally healthy—not free coronavirus infection. Litterally yes...ass lol. think it’s generally supposed mean bottom bag. guess makes sense think shape bag scooping around like cul de sac street would also English substitute ass bottom. Like kid falls butt instead “did hurt ass” say “did hurt bottom?”

I’m sure gives native French speakers giggles every time hear us say though People assholes. told someone contacted it, benefit willing home. I'd able groceries delivered instead pick up, lend tools neighbor, etc. easy enough decent person. God damnit. Couldn’t even get right exactly

but doesnt matter killing people dont get.....  look back kindly AMERICA

You could stop there, right. Exactly.  

That's say government they're doing, course. think know they're propping economy temporarily, they're placing country giant amount debt it.

It would worked much cheaply anti-science people running corrupt government owned special interests money.... basically, US presently is. make sure enough supply medical professionals. knew start. Atleast weve owned mistake gotten control. seem way Florida, texas, Arizona, California dozen states.

Can find recent article saying wear masks Canada I'd love read one. source estimated reduction mortality? Quit April, feels good... Still get cravings though.  


Congrats keep good fight. Sadly, yes. reason tolerate refuse remove platform, even though numerous YTers removed demonetized quite bit less.

Trumpkin bankrupting casinos ceo USA fucking muppet, I'm suggesting countries force citizens pay exploitative prices heathcare public tax-funded option use negotiate reasonable prices basic goddamn healthcare available citizens. little condemnation protests reported press? fact, experts hardly even bring protests factor spread covid. think it. experts talk almost every activity risk spreading covid, comes specific type demonstrations, much silence. sort self-censorship going on. anyone else little concerned they're rushing vaccine? testing rushed, could side effects discovered late. Get fuck outta Edinburgh. shitshow already showed globe can. No, I'm work.

Edit: deleted rude remark work healthcare. state special health care worker testing sites. contact tracing confirmed largely exposed covid, sent testing site... earliest said could see 6 days, results promised 4 hour went free test center got tested 2 hour wait. 

6 days later still didn’t test result back went medical worker place appointment got tested again. 

Negative. well good. health care worker confirmed exposure wait 6 days test? It’s ridiculous. (Nashville haven’t clicked) FFCRA requires payed 80 hours sick time situation. Anyone paying time reported labor department probably health department. #2

Lockdowns alone good measure mortality. grandparents lived house next door us growing up, great! got monster backyard play could pop dinner parents working. work real champs it. Basically working home end year. That’s funny idea long term effects Covid-19 are.

Exactly. could increase chances getting cancer could increase chances developing X-ray vision spider-like superpowers. 

So focus worst-case scenario instead best case scenario? reference, Austria (100+ new cases daily), roughly comparable size/population Ohio (1300+ new cases dialy avg.)

The United States confirmed order close. State Department spokeswoman Washington, Morgan Ortagus, said Wednesday order ""to protect American intellectual property private American information,"" US embassy said Beijing Wednesday. give details. poor baby. :-( sale well.ca. Sold now, course. Nice. illegal FFCRA. They're required give 80 hours paid sick leave situation since guidance quarantine isolate even waiting test. much. don’t know Americans keep referencing Italy Spain early warning signs countries learn from

What Korea? Taiwan? closest first hit countries *actually managed contain virus early on* two languages want learn primary language countries extremely tight immigration (Germany) literally can't live I'd executed (China), real shame China fascinates much. Chinese history really interesting Chinese architecture, even now, still nice.

I like Taiwan lot but... seem like safest area right plan long-term move to. Walmart: co worker told buddy tested positive. Got results 13 days tested. time still go work like nothing going on.

This doesn’t make sense me. telling every patient, regardless positive negative, get results back, assume **positive** self quarantine. Shouldn’t fucking hard. statistics back up. Gotchya.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* question virulence COVID-19. home state USA first weeks pandemic high number hospitalizations deaths, even though number infections extremely low (based percentage positive results tests)

Now local area infections absolutely roof, 10's thousands testing positive yet hospitals empty. 

Have multiple strains COVID-19? explanation decrease virulence? I'm struggling understand contrast.

Thanks! someone work public pay bills, last sentence easier said done. government’s unwillingness provide adequate social safety net pandemic killing us. masks:

💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀 That's probably 4th lol. averaging 500 cases day 10-15k 🤷‍♂️ ? U horse. case, 1,000 deaths day super tame. many trolls spreading misinformation aren’t internet savvy, simply want read things solidify confirmation bias, easily mislead. example, yesterday reading article Yahoo news. noticed bunch comments worded slightly different along lines know man died motorcycle accident, marked COVId. bunch variations, knew man, husband, brother-in-law, etc. noticed sub-comments comments saying know guy died motorcycle accident etc. Clearly thread full bots original comment something triggered bots reply whole thread accounts saying known someone died false counting. However, also know Americans idiots, guarantee least handful people looked comment thread today saying, well, heard guy motorcycle accident counted COVId. told death rates inflated. See, bullshit. That's honestly terrifying too.

Even though believe overall healthy life style exercises healthy diet, still possibility get severely sick it; even die.. i've always cautious nevertheless.

Be safe people.. TEXAS - New Kentucky could shut fuck TSA bullshit made flying obnoxious. many samples tested depends assay liquid handler involved. common one labs use Maxwell Maxwell 48. normal maxwell room 16 samples once, 2-3 controls. 48 room 48, closing controls. labs, that’s high throughout gets. might them, a) hard come right now, b) labs notoriously underfunded might lucky 2. maxwell run takes 4-5 hours, including sample prep time, go kind real time PCR tacks hours. beat case scenario test takes 8 hours assuming nothing went wrong run obtained valid results. lab also 20k sample back log test 13-45 time, people end waiting days days technically rapid test. 

The automation there, it’s equipment hard get, innovation go EUA approval FDA, month LEAST. also considered rapid, emergency use act, FDA approval revisions take 6-12 months. 

Source: Got 2 covid testing labs running midwest based biotech company. already multiple strains coronavirus. real doubts reliability antibody tests really need teach exponentials lag school Indeed. intentionally referenced lowest number seen thrown around, avoid accused kind exaggeration. Yep. life nutshell. way, Americans ignore COVID. quarantine five months. live middle socio-economic hell hole Miami-Dade county. legislature fault, vast majority people unable socially distance themselves. people simply can't afford give fuck. sitting 16k excess deaths.

That 6 weeks ago. takes time compile data, would hard kind data date, deaths spiking Texas, Florida, Arizona, would surprise still 16K. cat? novel idea, people don’t ton kids can’t afford? understand poverty it’s effect people, also understand stupidity. one cousin four kids don’t even good enough credit buy house. leach everyone annoying easily avoidable. Im florida. worker test positive. exposed 2 days socially distant work. wasn’t feeling feel went home. waited 9 days results tested positive got tested. Today day 8 without results.went drive dolphins stadium. office shut disinfected everything nobody allowed go back know negative. Two people already results went walk test site. got results within 72 hours. One people got tested twice already results twice haven’t received results first test. That's exactly what's happening didn’t happen. that’s always immune system works, either.

*Some*viruses worse next time get them. Dengue chicken pox comes mind. aren’t. assume SARS2 would drastically less damaging second time, lead become endemic 5th endemic coronavirus causes colds.

I would keep mind infection thing, would likely see pretty massive scale now. least hard hit areas like Brazil US. Money lives. RemindMe! 4 weeks That's anonymous. tracer simply tell people exposed. telling people exposed them. people 49 close 1%. figure way make parents parent win noble peace prize. solved foster care mostly likely poverty time. 

Would love every parent parent? absofuckinglutely realistic. Schools provide kids fall cracks. grew well poverty line. mom worked 2 jobs, day job night job, rarely seen school sometimes i'd catch morning school gone sleep yet. around help homework things mentioned. Luckily able get school. Minus dental checks...we school. Seconded! choice people enough money rent/buy alone?  lot people said quarentined did. agree, US live state employer fire reason. unfortunately wait till said yes. I'll give $10 goto Florida time one sees plateau one higher. You’re despicable AG state nuts said eff NY? said Cali NY ain’t yet. need get crazed. Looking life measure success.  Cali still way ahead. math proves it. Cali dealing lot different components...so don’t control way NY controlling borders.  Wrong, every death coronavirus equivalent. 13 year olds logic.... wide spread reddit. Yeah rankings differ. Sometimes see ETH Zurich UC Berkeley top 10 sometimes not. usually see Oxford, Cambridge Imperial top 10. don’t like much feel it’s little biased Oxford Cambridge, it’s still good. prefer [RoundRanking"
