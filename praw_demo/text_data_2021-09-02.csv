0,2021-09-02,"  [sic] infections Delta variant Covid-19 finally peaked United States?

Are journalists required take English classes anymore? variant mutations, might allow bypass immunity gained existing vaccines / infections. ok, human body doesn’t 1 single antibody per pathogen one stops working backups. types antibodies classified according target virus, ie class 1 class 3.

The worry 3 classes antibodies potentially affected due needed mutations found Mu variant.

If true, need updated vaccine specific Mu variant immediately. Else it’s going renewed wave infections again.

However evidence won’t happen, antibodies class made ineffective. don’t enough research know going happen yet.

The good news sequence Mu variant production plant mRNA vaccines, easily swop current DNA template new template Mu Variant start production within weeks. guess:
1. many European countries schools started. US started earlier, AFAIK.
2. think Europe vaccination rates adults evenly spread across regions, country big Texas state attitude vaccines. Generally, cities, vaccination rates exceed 60% adults, coutries probably even 80%.  Surgical masks fit well. ordered cloth mask fit really well (cups around chin ehich problem surgical masks- they're loose, wire nose) place filter. put surgical mask filter pocket wonder good? maybe double wear surgical mask underneath it. good reason interact police. Fuckers like rogan isnt helping places got encouragement campaign increased mask wearing 30% good information effective treatment? affects likelihood developing long COVID symptoms? make jokes now, laughing Florida man forges death certificate tries use avoid wearing mask? answer yes. much, yes. *hopefully* talking talking two different things. Patrick Mahomes subluxation knee. That's fact. chiropractor tells ""out alignment"" cracks back bullshit. combination massage, stretching, placebo effect. Maybe heat treatment. Save money, stretch yoga, buy heat pad, get massage, take naproxen. chiropractor great, non-quack, wants people feel healthier. try convince nonsense, work together find best treatment body. Proper physical manipulation joints great physiological affect. try telling reddit that, though. There's thing normal chiropractor, according reddit. Critical thinking taught US school system. sure came that. Technically something dysfunctional still functional, function way supposed to...

...Or function way design... think is: kids, today find mommy daddy actually want dead  Monoclonal antibodies problem. fact, far black-and-white. name ""monoclonal"" implies, 1 type antibody, wrong mutation virus treatment becomes ineffective. Vaccines produce far broader spectrum antibodies, means they're directly completely useless wrong mutation. top that, vaccines elicit production memory cells, shown react wide variety variants (albeit slowly antibodies, prevent infection, mitigate effects). Oh good. got mine redone covid. understand correctly, enough positive tests could still take team game. know many dearly loved friends family said much bullshit last 18 months.  

Its rubbing me. I'm social level irritated everyone, deeply personal level extremely frustrated fucking trenches again. 

Ivmay convinced mom trying convince dad get shot. fairly confident last 18 months trying convince mom 7 actual days back forth debate.

Most conversation me. mom posting, quoting, citing bullshit blogs, poorly sourced articles. would spend 75% time trying keep whatever shit read billions doses administered world wide.  Finally. Last week FDA approved finally made crack. 

My mom dad (R).  Dad fly lot travel country. vaccine required yet works, signs point get shot expensive pay travel need do. Dad said ""Fuck that. Im going quit."" Mom said, ""No fucking not."", that.

Mom tells this, ask gotten yet going make dad it. says gonna get Dad. mad ""everyone bullying her"" get vaccine. 

Honestly I'll take W... mother legit scared. said ""You'll first one side get sick shot?"". didnt take bait. told mom anything worry about. dont know wonder anti vaxxers deathly afraid this. took much thine whole time convince mom, scared legitimately... I'll take W dont energy convince everyone 5he antivaxxers fear. Yep, crazy thing deficit ran last year, 10% GDP, far deficits countries like US run every year.

I've also changed I've sat, use different chair.

Also seems research says otherwise. aware recent article. also, thank naming logical fallacy. heard one. also believe example post diction fallacy. go chiropractor expecting feel better, didn't, would escalated invasive treatments (ie. surgery). case friend, issue never really got solved, never went see chiropractic treatment effective not. Pharmacist here, actually studied alternative medicine herbal remedies coursework well. things work, like st John's wort antidepressant. also ton really bad drug interactions, years studied new drugs made produce pharmacodynamic effect less drug interactions due different metabolism.

Aside Auckland probably take 4 weeks rest country harsh lockdown 2 weeks. 

A lot people can/are working lvl4 everyone else work lvl3. 

Our harsh restrictive lockdowns sooo short compared rest world, therefore end living normal life restrictions long periods time. It’s quite simple really  Restaurant mandate much effective company requirement could help front well, ask nicely None issues raise change significant way *daily lives themselves*. realize sometimes people can't buy GPU want there's global chip shortage. realize employers US looking harder employees. And, well, wars still thing. pretend issues raised due Covid even remotely affect *daily* much civil obedience new set always-changing rules ludicrous \[note post originally replied to\]. also think people countries zero covid policies like New Zealand affected labor shortages total lockdowns?

Climate change? Well, gave win - unless believe climate significantly changed much 2019, year gave, - **you agree** changes daily lives due climate change due, maybe, policy due climate change. Although honest, know draconian measure policy anywhere world. I'm feeding troll.

Listen, sorry going ad hominem here, acting like American politician. like got mic thought ""I'll raise points have, ever"". they're irrelevant, bad form. points might relevant discussion, here. lmfao chiropractors arent even doctors. oh wait, neither fucking idiot thinks anything value add pandemic professional.  bigger problem HHS/CDC/NIAID care much evidence outside US. Many governments use masks time suppress flu common cold. Well damn, realized I've nothing one tetanus shot since kid, yearly flu shot. done pharmacies like flu shots? Chiropractors doctors way check-out lady Walmart pharmacist sells Advil.  wished stats would give ICU beds people believe science. It’s kind dumb people thought virus hoax going straight hospital wanting cured right away. smelt dealt use mask hide beautiful face lol Florida ftw There’s usage ivermectin COVID patients, study based pulled fraudulent fuck.

Delta going put wilt numbers. winter. won’t surprised see huge spike Texas Florida 2x worse. clear thought PPE overboard institution leans far mouth lick gums you, wear PPE *outside* pandemic, overkill *before* vaccine? would nurse go rural hospital could travel LA, Austin, Miami basically take vacation days ? strategy Sweden always been. Reduce transmission rates mix bans large gatherings voluntary social distancing. Herd immunity always thought factor would reduce transmission rates long run, never goal strategy. 

The reason hear much days numbers Sweden comparatively good can't stoke panic countries them. It’s logical fallacy called post studied scientific rigor, Chiropractic practices shown either helpful significantly harmful. go feel better mean caused it. almost certainly placebo effect. 

No matter slice it, pass anything remotely like scientific merits.

It’s fine don’t know works, need understand powerful system determining things true, things false. Thats science. Thats does.

But don’t understand science works, cannot ever convince you. leave it. mean 3 hours podcast ICU doctor/lung specialist covered Ivermectin 3 hours? wasn’t short Instagram video that’s floating around. podcast June 22nd you’re curious. probably 10-20 million listens (I don’t know look up). folks get medicine they're empathetic care people

Hahahahaha, fucking chiropractors. bad Naturopaths. us blessed perfect dentist.  Non Covid patients fight beds could vaccinated avoided hospitalization.  They’re almost always 13 weeks I'm sorry got bad enough anyone feel like this. give merit?

I'm exactly sure I'm looking looking ""demonic spirit spine"". see headline asked ""is chiropractic care demonic"" ""demons sex humans"" seem anything chiropractic treatment.

Anecdotally, say chiropractic treatment helped years ago lower back hurting feeling numbing upper leg. likely caused sitting long periods time, sat, office chair sitting in. went chiropractor, 3 sessions, numbing leg went away, well pain lower back. kind pain since then.

Also, coworker mine feeling similar pain numbness, except shoulder area. goes MD several times inject muscle relaxers prescribed medication makes drowsy. kind helps pain never truely solved problem.

I've heard similar stories, that's ask there's enough them, give treatment merit. parasite even? Probably given distance... mean Rand Paul, MD Duke certified practice Ophthalmology American Board Ophthalmology.  later set certification lower price address saw unfair practices ABO.

Several European countries unemployment rate approaching surpassing pre-pandemic levels. Germany 3.6%. countries like Greece, unemployment barely grew all. even know relevant ended 2020 either small growth slight contraction depending metrics. 

Not according country's official statistical office. NZ's GDP [declined 2,9% worse result [the Nordic slightly better [the (which however recovering faster).

I’ve heard that’s good luck. shocking backward US is.. rather good percentage population MLB player pay convoluted get details. Every year, salary cap teams MLB. year (2021), $210 million. total amount pay players. team goes it, pay tax (22.5%). go cap two years row, tax increases(30%). Every year row, tax goes max 50% year 4 believe. first limiter, effective. 

Players get signed contracts. hear ESPN Babe Ruth Jr. signed $15 million 3 years. Sweet, that's $5 million year... well exactly. stay salary cap, team might make deal player says Babe Ruth Jr. gets paid $3 million year 3 years, million every year after. Thats still pretty good, less time $5 million number. believe Yankees signed someone insane number like $70 million 5 years majority paid time. 

Players also get cool performance bonuses written contract. obvious team wide deals, like getting play offs World Series. better players, get performance incentives. Say Babe Ruth Jr. best base stealer league. Naturally, contract, would clause ""if BRJ steals 20 bases year, gets one time season bonus $200,000. BRJ steals 30 bases, gets aforementioned $200k additional $400k."" excellent players get sorts mini clauses home runs, base hits, batting average, ERA, excellent fielded plays total, more. 

And lastly, minimum wage MLB player 2021 570,000 dollars. Yeah paid extremely well might think. pretty convoluted high potential tons money since clauses sometimes count towards salary caps. hope answered question. long ago underpaid, since 2002 pretty good players (compared average American)  hospitals do.

Florida: Yes 


People: May see it?


Florida: No. one enjoys reddit Yes, (properly conducted, blinded) studies conducted far show chiropractic treatment offers advantage placebo*.

*The caveat studies show benefit ""cracking"" thoracic spine (middle back), using short, gentle firm pressure area. apparently improve mobilisation inflamed joints.

This something chiropractors traditionally did. However, evidence, many physiotherapists using type treatment appropriate. hand (based anecdotal ""evidence"" I've seen), chiropractors increasingly moving away cracking spine all. Instead using little metal ""hammers"" tap back joints. assume many chiropractors got sued breaking people's necks severing arteries harsh manipulation (there multiple case reports kind injury world). 

Needless say, evidence tapping spine little metal hammer helps anything way.

So one thing chiropractors might found useful longer seem because, medically trained professionals, know safely. many states crime claim doctor without PhD MD. extremely uncommon chiropractor anything higher license. wondering Florida's 7 day average went almost 200 per 100k 80 per less week...

Thankfully symptoms way mild could still shitty. Wishing speedy recovery. yes screw anti vaxx idiots ruining everyone.  thing people show jobs person depending job (tradesmen, healthcare workers, etc.) students can’t always handle online classes either. Several students school college prefer meeting new people person always online. 

People already enough want go back way things covid. Many people don’t want sit another whole year crap want able go events activities like concerts sporting events. People’s mental health likely get much worse force lockdown many others won’t handle well happen.    explained medical diagnoses made don’t seem understand “fatigue” symptom, diagnosis.

Post-viral syndrome isn’t anything new uncommon. Covid causes varying degrees, too.

In words, smells like nonsense you’ve completely misrepresented both.  Yep! 200 viruses cause common I’ve seen article nature discussed possibly fraudulent study pulled 

Pubmed article assessed ivermectin. studies compared ivermectin placebo, nothing standard care. authors conclusion uncertain efficacy safety. 

If NIH wants study it, that’s scientists do. studies show ivermectin safe effective, people talk taking drug. amazing amount people buy DeSantis Idiot's approach thinking. look it. Much appreciated. want force back office police every move. It’s simple Anything anchovies. Yuck. guess faith people US knew better given availability information. seemed logical people would better equipped tell bullshit truth think critically safety well-being. medical diagnoses referring to? 

Many studies based mail-in questionnaires. Long covid symptoms self reported. medical professionals involved. would rather 10 million kids almost likely stunted mental growth 300,000 could potentially get long COVID?  still contract tracing. received call state TN last Friday another call today. thought would've happened sooner notify close contacts since family 6 (4 children) caught public school system. That's fiction part - believing [hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, etc.] works well better vaccine.

There long guest piece either LA Times Washington Post recently - can't remember - emergency doctor described compassion fatigue great, agonizing detail. One biggest factors exact problem: patients wanted every effort made save lives, even though turned one treatment works best (and continue to, cases). take care themselves, show care people burdened treating hundreds others, demand utmost care return. Individualism means preparing bad things suffering consequences don't. also include voluntary actions help others. backwards right now, disheartening say least. Standard operating procedure One word capitalism Thanks. Maybe you’ll learn credibility go back school Wait.... telling world doomed vaccines made mandatory? that's sounds.

Either misinterpreting point.

The point ways getting virus control without statewide mandatory vaccination. least evidence suggest true. got evidence contrary please share that. Yes, air one place always stays one place... sweet Jesus. people bitter enders. hope enough time w vaccines realize needed along course 3-shots two

I've kind thinking like that. also alternate line thought two doses actually enough, got dosing schedule incorrect go back correct it. obvious? amount variants, vaccines even virus unlikely make us ""immune"" them. Every vaccine targets spike protein 27(?) proteins need protecting from. get actually catching virus. unlikely get sick double dose vaccine, get 27 proteins otherwise virus. kind cling flesh decay fail you. One day crude biomass call temple wither beg kind save you. already saved.  It’s around 69% fully vaccinated. Depending look it’s great - I’m Texas, abysmal comparison states give shit.  Oh yes, know. obviously increased rate admission would worse. explained medical diagnoses made. 

The word “fatigue” means nothing own. daughter's elementary school changed definition ""exposure"" ""within 6 ft confirmed positive case 2 hours"" (I think school changed definition). orientation stressed many times parents could get excused absence saying ""my child sick"" information. Notifying teacher child tested positive COVID required. real conspiracy conservative leadership continues question vaccine, downplay virus, politicize precautions, push snake oil treatments even face death. Whoever accepted begin fucking moron. MD. quite, used control said net. used rate financial credibility. Thank you!!!! Thanks 😊   I'm convinced? Booster shots probably beneficial, doubt ""full protection"" good descriptor. data claim confidence  shut up. Article says 5, Bay Area News Group investigation published last month revealed least five death certificates January 2020 five states — California, Oklahoma, Alabama, Wisconsin Kansas — amended recent months include COVID-19 factor. Kansas’ earliest. There’s difference high risk higher risk. I’m higher risk I’m older, I’m high risk.  Smartidiot? 😆 NOBODY COULD SEEN COMING! /s Thank you. Another thing recommend (depending feasibility area) ""walk work"". often walk 15-20 minutes work really feels like getting preparing day ahead. Since flexible hours sometimes walk like 1-1.5 hours, relaxed actually able sit long without going crazy. probably time bit consistently ""walk work"".

That, wearing nice clothes work (and taking done it). Endemic pandemic aren’t exclusionary concepts, fwiw. aren’t either/or. 

They’re two entirely different things. 

For example, *endemic* disease isn’t necessarily less dangerous less contagious. also doesn’t mean “safer.” be. 

Similarly, *epidemic* *pandemic* disease isn’t determined virology even immunity, matter. 

Influenza endemic. also seasonal flu epidemics. Occasionally, also flu pandemics. Similarly, obesity practically endemic United States. disease isn’t contagious, less dangerous simply it’s common. 

[What **An endemic disease outbreak consistently present limited particular region. makes disease spread rates Malaria, example, considered endemic certain countries regions.

I mean, simply, 18 months sh-t could essentially mean endemic. Doesn’t change fact we’re also midst deadly pandemic. 

[What World Health Organization (WHO) declares pandemic disease’s growth exponential. means growth rate skyrockets, day cases grow day **In declared pandemic, virus nothing virology, population immunity, disease severity**. means virus covers wide area, affecting several countries populations.

I would love know think problems virtual solved. Virtual learning different across board depending grade. son started kindergarten last year wasnt something would work. Kids age struggle learn via zoom calls, elementary students well.

Those older struggle well, see results state testing, scores reading/math/science dropped sometimes HALF since 2019 state alone Virtual work.

There ways make person possible safe. Several schools area masks policies plexi glass set seats. Students also dont move rooms often teachers ones move around, students less interaction. None schools covid case school year (they opened mid august) last year.

So it’s simply dosage that’s problem. assume that’s doc article meant idiot gonna run simply adjust dosage lol Mostly 4 weeks vaccine brands, 6-8 weeks period due supply issue. Lmao Imagine trying make defamatory article Ivermectin instead showcasing real problem gun violence America. part better suggesting American cattle farmers also inept routinely stick ivermectin needles meant cattle still push plunger overdose themselves. Holy crap article terrible. 

Statements without supporting documentation real deed Brooklyn Bridge. trained professionals took oath discriminate people need help people deserve naturally selected.  passed Oklahoma June, told wife ""Welcome Texas's hat"".  Ngl, legit worked bed lock down. hooked PC tv. actually got hacked right lock down, even work first month. started PC gaming worked. fun. feel like kind spoiled me. Like life suppose laid back. could devise sort mouth-hole covering could safely inoffensively placed front mouth-hole inside schools public buildings. Worse, study withdrawn. never accepted anywhere thus could retracted. preprint. lynchpin several metastudies.

That’s quality data involved.  Maybe it’s good thing Bonnaroo got canceled. Indeed. believe concerns high doses neurotoxic. terminally American headline.  Short answer: yes, vaccines work, still extremely well hospitalization death, less well moderate sickness delta original Covid Classic virus. delta variant what's going around countries (e.g. 98% US cases).

So vaccine effectiveness longer 95% people planned lives lot policy decisions around (which vaccine Phase 3 trial results last year), instead, delta variant, like 80% getting minor moderately sick (maybe 90-95% hospitalization/death). Furthermore, gradual erosion effectiveness body's immune response wears long term, like ~12 months. draw line give people booster shot open question (6 months? 8 months? etc.).

The thing previously assumed fully vaccinated people got breakthrough positive Covid case probably going less infectious unvaccinated person got Covid. measurements suggest breakthrough cases infectious unvaccinated cases. also affects policy decisions (mask wearing, etc.). correct dose scientifically proven anything. order ivermectin ANYTHING, basically od it. mean started vaccinating? Yes, distribution changed since then, changing ratio cases hospitalizations/deaths. But, again, changing cases rise. sure infuriating tbh, fact gun shot victims wait receive treatment fact people would rather take livestock medication get Covid-19 vaccination.

“I don’t trust Covid shot x,y,z reason take horse dewormer Covid.”

It makes sense, that’s get trying apply logic hysterical people. spreading misinformation everywhere? easily debunked makes us look like lying fools. Stop it. truth (that rare) good enough need exaggerate. great died

The ODers is. Get gunshot victims treatment need!  k, talked it. Lol America fucked. Genuine question: data waiting on, think might ~three months now?

The reasons would waiting get booster 1) know Pfizer Moderna better booster Pfizer; 2) find limited immune ability generate responses, maybe better ""save"" boosters later strain; 3) ADE -- unlikely; 4) know optimal window (which might even miss waiting around). Correct I'm wrong, NONE things likely answered next months, waiting around again? Maybe #2 answered soon?

I'm worried death/hospitalization here, I'm tryin' get long covid go disability...because job requires person. Waiting around free either. tried post tweet, mods won’t let through:(

You horse. cow. Seriously, y'all. Stop it. Unless body exists outside realm medical possibility, opinion relevant nobody cares.  Call Woodie Guthrie someone  medical scientific consensus whatsoever springs up, think unequivocally stated ""ivermectin bad, vaccine good.""

There could thousand things *could* work, they're proven otherwise serve muddy waters *what factually work, right now.*  saying get exception vaccine due reaction. entirely clear details. refusing treatment burn wants exception. Doctors trying explain probably get sepsis die treated wants exception.

The burn insane. covers nipple nipple (they barely escaped) goes way belly button. guy little heavyset, see whatever liquid pooled creases rolls. top roll fine crease burnt. remaining skin greyish, tonnes exposed flesh like yellow crusty fat. gross. choose be. Ahh sorry, reading second paragraph post thought understanding UK gov already made decision.   vaccine made sleepy day idk made right call Seems like reverse. peer reviewed medical research says prevents COVID. hate science want, end science win out. Ivermectin effective single dose vaccine. purely logical ideal world sense, yes right move vaccinate everyone valid medical exemption. Literally reason question level resistance populace. felt sick mild fever mild chest arm pain moderna, thought weird minimal side effects second Pfizer. 3 days later still occasional mild chest pain (probably anxiety) still feel run school resuming fall/winter still come. No. suspect there's significant fraction anti-vaxxers would support it. people given right choose vaccination? Lack environmental regulations shitty food lowered overall cognitive ability average citizen. 

In environment lacking true predators, result. percentage Republican voters? don’t get they’re treating people. 

I’m definitely going sound like massive asshole, don’t get it. many options, much information there, many warnings, ignore end situation. 

If weren’t clogging hospital beds, I’d inclined change opinion, bottom priority list lose spot someone else comes isn’t due taking shit. Cases change uniformly age groups 

It's US data, school session locations.  
COVID cases worst they've ever age 5-11, 33% peak number breakthrough infections overstated? 

Do people fake vaccine cards count towards breakthrough infection numbers?

I'm sure way differentiate antibodies vaccinated unvaccinated, stretched medical system whoever accumulating data due diligence?  Stop treating them. already consulted medical practice Dr. Facebook MD (no degree found). need treat them, let one gave advice treatment, continue treat them. That's amazing, link?  Vaxed people dying. ""It estimated 80% infected patients SARS-CoV-2 developed one long-term symptoms.""

This smells like nonsense,

From article: ""that 80% (95% CI 65–92) individuals confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis continue least one overall effect beyond 2 weeks following acute infection""

""Effects"" include ""fatigue"" btw... Keep forgetting lies like read wrote? *….if able get vaccinated didn’t want it*. feel sorry someone whose eligible medically able refuses vaccine gets sick dies? don’t feel sorry someone refuses quit smoking gets lung cancer. Almost every medical professional saying get think know better bites ass that’s them.   least lie they're killing viewers voters. wish/hope infect innocent people along way. Except pretty effective preventing COVID, dosed correctly. O.D. gunshots, hell yeah baby Got iphone 7 battery replaced day.

Idiots. enough comment health care worker, least inside bounds CDC ACIP considering get boosters first -- see especially side Healthcare personnel mild disease cannot work, prevention mild disease takes greater importance public health goal population

.. (as stated Monday's ACIP meeting) anything goes wrong.  ever find let us know. We'll rest team sanity. promising preliminary research suggesting effective treating covid observed r/covid19 year ago

However, dosage tested 100x normal dosage. problem people taking horse medication overriding problem letting anyone guns. 

This American headline I've seen while. Vets use big ass needle though. can't actually make microchips small enough fit needle COVID vaccine. it’s easy do, guess everyone it? Lol us introverts. People definitely gathering year holidays. sure be. I’ll cautious, stayed home year now. Fully vaccinated, celebrating accordingly. I’ve made relatively specific point flattening conversation “ivermectin good” “ivermectin bad.”

I also said getting vaccine makes sense need studies ivermectin. 

The downvotes confirm general unwillingness engage complexity. need mandate nationally, none healthcare workers.   We? 

The CDC submitted vaccine recommendation United States. FDA yet approved Singapore … vaccines

So we’ll agree they’re still least 40% effective preventing infection, meaning [unvaccinated least ~2.5x ~5x [**more likely** become infected folks [both protection infection could 80% [or [booster particularly [high-risk Well, least get back right receiving second dose. 

That’s get [*even immunity [than “right receiving” [the second stop spreading disinformation. Yea two wrongs make right.

Are advocating enforced enlistment? Yep, that's felt pain statement. Excellent point. chips, voltron bit. (Edit assembly part, voltron joke)

I realize thought assembled Kansas — Peaches Foster’s mother, Lovell “Cookie” Brown, died hospital Jan. 9, 2020, middle America, 7,200 miles Wuhan, China, weeks world understood mysterious respiratory virus circling globe threatening humanity.

The rest article clarifies updated death certificate may may based real evidence. need apologize. possible people complete agreement, also offend one another 👍

Your bottom point strong one. Misinformation tertiary sources information (like reddit comments, Facebook) pervasive. People need spend time calling crap out, need tiptoe around overly nice either. 

In covid case, misinformation contributing directly loss life. horrible. quite frustrating. far know 47 COVID deaths US children 14 days. death rate continue throughout year, obviously hope doesn’t, would 1222 children lost. heard med system collapses far enough, plans bring vets in. anyone bring ivermectin also big pharma product? Merck (who incidently specifically released public statements saying ""no, please give us money case."") don’t think able go hospital 10 day quarantine, wife took leaves work get it. COMPLETE shitshow recovery COVID managing schoolwork keeping kids entertained. 3 weeks later extremely mild case still massive fatigue. WONDER (because i've childcare 24/7 2 weeks straight COVID). True many sequences. issue know viral shedding resume later testing negative. also know people minimal symptoms virus still body waiting immune system compromised. 

So options true, reinfections still remain unlikely. look large populations like Israel research tens thousands people. 

We also know it’s possible people false positives got covid legitimately believed reinfected. Stupidity needs part ER triage system. surprised many people listen Joe Rogan little data back I've strong suspicion time UK's really large increase cases partially caused country's incomprehensible position vaccinating children. data showing children spread it, quite effectively. did. took *everything*, ivermectin.

He also claimed feeling ton better still looking half dead. Maybe upswing recover soon, maybe bravado, idk. think so. God loves idiots... issue naming variants this.
I'd like know hell came avoid place. three options quite sobering, especially latter two. first option obviously preferable enjoy free fully-functioning society. fourth option mention nothing watch medical system collapses. given past 6 months gone, I'd say that's headed near future.



But yes, point *after* healthcare system collapses much country millions people unable access care all, maybe (as society) make ""hard"" choices (and mean common sense choices based enlightened self interest, politically unpopular are, really *that* hard). Also harp much, really think FDA bungled thing slow-walking approval mRNA vaccines ages 6-11. 


Although know blame ultimately lies unvaxxed especially peddlers disinformation. Ironic people whining losing freedoms ones forcing us ever draconian rules, since never trusted comply good faith. like way horsey sauce coats clogs arteries. It’s amazing.  It’s misleading headline. 

80% “have form immunity”. means antibodies. them, **does mean immune**. form immunity equate immune. 

So, it’s 80% immune. It’s 80% either vaccinated COVID. demographics still get COVID still spread unvaccinated people even vaccinated people.

Delta also contagious serious. viral load severe form immunity going prevent hospitalization death (generally speaking). exactly it’s supposed do. unlikely prevent contracting spreading it.

Now, take info couple everyone behaving pandemic magically, despite large percentage population (children 12) unable vaccinated, recipe spreading deadly virus.  what? cases don’t mean anything, asymptotic ppl r still considered case.

hospitalizations deaths looked NJ still #1 death can't believe this. give dog puppy mange. Even worried he's border collie might sensitivity it. He's fine, all, I'd never take myself. people definitely screw loose.  Thousands people afraid drive cars. Also car I'm little bit control it.

Doctors treating patients high amounts acetaminophen. Amounts high cause liver failure, symptoms nearly identical pneumonia.

Many 1918 flu deaths seem directly attributable medication overdosing rather actually dying flu, even though time, deaths listed caused flu.

Which diminish severity pandemic then, illustrating harmful treatments often viewed cures.

We've learned mistakes, make sure actually trials see effective drug something instead prescribing willy-nilly.

Well... us learned, suppose. Excellent point, something keep mind live Florida potentially something this. MDs trained entire body, receive specialised training particular area medicine. Podiatrists like except skip whole-body training go straight foot/ankle specialisation. 

An MD missing thyroid problem whole issue entirely indeed problem ignore whole ethics part, sure. England. Also aren’t cases Scotland highest UK? Yeah, decent time stock up.

About $1-$2 per mask shipped (quite comparable price KN95). 

Usually expiration date 5-10 years (some date), buy box two, keep Ziploc bag somewhere dry/cool

In case illness looks like covid, wear doctors office (or virtual visit first) Ok base rate reinfections. every 10,000 people get covid, many get reinfected?

Let's give someone else chance lead, huh?

That's US, Swedish, Israeli governments actually worried about. still medical doctor  tagteam NSW COVID defeating Victoria disappointing Scott Gottlieb said last week around late Nov/early December. also said things got much worse, perhaps FDA would consider earlier date. got J&amp;J screwed I? Jesus Christ…We’re screwed.

On positive note, yesterday one middle schools shut sent kids home due outbreak teachers telling kids parents take get vaccinated. plan vaccinate large proportion population reopen. I've seen numerous people say bluntly lockdowns work. according Scott Gottlieb. saying endemic vaccination get rid virus. 

Also, really theoretical question. I've mentioned number times many countries world likely ever get anywhere near vaccination rate adults. poorer countries adult vaccination programs. used work Afghanistan flu shot programs, example. probably 20 countries world really functioning government poor functioning health systems likely get anywhere near 85/90% vaccination intake adults. 

I think wildcard 2 year old vaccine future. Many countries child vaccination programs. best solution would intervene 1:1 tutoring mentoring pandemic defeated, people longer dying, coronaviruses using bodies evolve in, safely talk front chalk board. *not* safe pretend pandemic exist now. 

If really concerns you, please volunteer 1:1 literacy tutor underprivileged kids vaccinated. father law used this.  Apparently plausible, killed guy. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Sure, homeschool, participate society pesky responsibilities people.  Likely not. 10% population massive amount people Covid animal reservoirs eliminates chance eradication. would likely well controlled though. Right? Would save time headache  start saying god, people think crazy, somehow 2000 years ago seemed plausible. don’t know, tell me. US need vaccinated people, vaccinating children helps, average, vaccination adult arm prevents serious disease much efficiently vaccination child arm. 

What data looking conclude vaccinating children would make huge difference? I'd say US needs get adult rates up, luckily daily rates still upward trend. think necessary part, vaccinating younger children good obviously, understand would big game changer. true medical specialist? 

I'd thought real difference podiatrist initial 3 year MD prior branching seems fairly unique (and similar dentistry regard). friend friend decided get vaccinated pregnant. got covid miscarriages coma. Get vaccine, please! chiropractors elaborate front drug sales, would least understand. kids get sick, recover move on. 

Most brush off. get really sick, percentage die.

Before chickenpox vaccine, nearly 10K kids would die every year, chickenpox cause encephalitis. cower homes, tossed kids chickenpox parties. 

But vaccines kids reach endemic stage. People need multiple exposures. Here's actual paper: intervention promote mask wearing (including free distribution). outcomes increase mask wearing 13.3% 42.3%, decrease COVID-like symptoms 8.6% 7.6% seroprevalence decrease 0.76% 0.68%. absolute quacks. wife went one kept saying need flu shot, get adjustment. also said bring kids (ages 1 3 time) adjust neck prevent ear infections.

Hell I'm letting touch kids!  And, believe 100% acceptance rate. afford ""tuition"" accepted Unless you’re Russia lmao Exactly right. ""Ya know... morons""  guy invented Chiropractic also came healing magnets. D.D. Palmer. good put chiros level veterinarians. least vets practice science based medicine animals. magnet fine job dont leave house pay magnet first time. try magnet. wonder anti vaxxers deathly afraid vaccine matter what

My friend admitted much. conversation answers every single one concerns. end said ""Everything said makes sense, know want get vaccine. heart screams No"".

Billions people, every country world, taking multiple types vaccines, developed pharma universities, profit not, mRNA, old school, researchers media scrutinizing every little detail... still enough. frustrating. course. sound minded doctor would recommend using mask. quacks. don’t get parental consent thing vaccination. mean kid came home said got flu shot school wouldn’t care one little bit. Ahhhhhhhhhh allow first place wtfff alignment

This bones work  but, chiropractors know wassup good experiences chiropractor. 

However concede modern medicine never wrongly killed anyone. /s (just careful tylenol)

Floridians, sending kids school please wear mask. stupid, they're willfully misinformed. believe Facebook foxnews. let disability everyone believes religion disabled. many countries, means close US, handling poorly? think that's difference, capable handling better countries. Vaccine production, testing, etc. Possibly dumb question could covid eliminated able vaccinate let's say 90% people? Darwin’s work continues… Call venue ask them.. accept photo phone, I’d go route. Anyone believes chiropractors real doctors snake oil salesmen insane.  western thing imo. many parts east Asia people vigilant ever (except extremes very, start). Japan we're pass US fully vaxxed numbers still far norm wear mask even walking around outdoors yourself. expect stay way least another year two. Yes Good. Hopefully naturopathic quacks well.

People believe lot strange things - believe works. Like Ivermectin Covid instead Vaccine. People rational. make poor decisions. ICU multiple days non covid reasons earlier year. horrifying wake call, completely changed lifestyle. number improvement 'some best I've seen' according doctors.

I wonder doctors seemed happy making progress. figured everyone situation would everything to, know, live longer life. truly believe large percentage people avoid medications drastically improve overall mental physical health proper diet lifestyle changes.

Healing crystals fine used properly. forcefully impact skull said healing crystal start getting diminishing returns. status quo till number deaths reach flu like levels hospitals arent overwhelmed.

Demon spirits living spine real thing. played Hitman? osteopaths != chiropractors    They’re taking horse paste there. Medical advice chiropractor step up. sure exactly you’re asking (if anything), last question makes virus dangerous? It’s 4 main things: 

1.	SARS-CoV-2 much easily spread flu 
2.	The virus deadly flu, Ebola deadly many times deadly
3.	Even don’t die, there’s high chance hospitalization. risks overwhelming healthcare system everyone starts dying things previously manageable. delta people staying ICU like 55 days compared 7-15 days alpha. makes worse. 
4.	A large number people get symptoms still infectious. different flu also, part COVID spreads fast, people literally don’t know they’re sick nobody tell looking. 

All adds something spiral quickly control (now primarily among unvaccinated). herniated disk back last year (I concrete work) finally went doctor spring suffering bad sciatica whole winter. gave mri sent physical therapy. month half noticed back leg got better possibly worse. stopped going physical therapy sister doctor asked tried chiropractor went (this last April). cracked back 3 seconds told may take couple weeks heal come friday next couple mondays fridays. went back Friday asked take mask itll minute, reluctantly did, got cracked way. Following Monday get call office saying closed emergency didnt follow friday either busy work. also made appointment last resort get back injections following week 2 days injections back leg pain miraculously started getting better canceled injections. summer issues. dealing unimaginable pain kept nights winter dude cracked better.

A couple months later decide open old mail chiropractor office letter explaining chiropractor died (covid) last day office day last fixed back, died like week later. kind dumbfounded. Hope pass unknowingly brief moment maskless. leave great review read letter, felt horrible seemed like nice guy even nice people believe dumb shit. I've read thread, horror stories different see MDs. less frequent I'm finding. Wait self-medicating truth seekers find ultra-secret anti-covid drug Goprelto decide research. /s point hospital start prioritizing cancer patients unvaccinated covid patients stupidity? medical care works? you’re size fucking refrigerator, you’re stupid get vaccinated. 

I seriously don’t understand - many people insanely overweight think they’re “young healthy!” don’t need vaccine, reality, they’re higher risk elderly. help? send coffee? I'm vaccinated convinced hesitant parents vaccinate. help you? sure meant sarcasm not... case - pretty much nobody except chiropractors believes thing dislocated rib.

If indeed happen you, treated condition doctors agree real. probably bruising condition would resolved without treatment, perhaps anti inflammatory medication.

(Disclaimer - doctor, interested consumer health services. expert particular topic. doctors think misunderstood situation, feel free correct me. Reliable, refereed sources always appreciated). gripe article—surgical masks n95, way around. 

I feel nurses. We’re seeing ICU, also aren’t governed someone seems hellbent killing us, even we’re still horrendously overwhelmed ICU hospital running code red max capacity. can’t imagine bad  Depends research, suppose.

I literally wanted walk out. crown fitting. go back weeks later idiot one put on. pissed didn’t really choice.

My scheduled 6 month cleaning supposed last week. Cancelled shit without thought even though I’m fully vaxxed now. Really sucks dentist literally 5 min walk front door don’t know ever go again. Maybe read thread. It’s really common.

It’s hard find look it. yes, doctors prescribe anything. Thats argument chiro. Bro learning black death gave existential crisis 9th grade. Like life really awful?

Yerp. Baa aah baaa aah Lower back pain chiropractor's bread butter -- precisely common.

Cool story, sounds like chiropractor simply cold-read you. Plus, I'm sure get adept ""diagnosing"" things rote repetition. mean they're quacks whose professional foundations based entirely pseudoscientific bullshit.

It became thing many poor middle-income countries, notably Peru, treat people IVM, use prophylactic surge really got going. lead [significant correlation using lot IVM surges became impossible run trials (plus nobody wanted spend money). still know works. 
the de facto replacement actually disproven HCQ, simply picked standard ""we need worry COVID miracle cure"".

As today Peru highest mortality world, still high-signal trials Ivermectin all, best case roughly 1/10 risk reduction vaccination. 60+ age group 100k unvaccinated 1.4 million vaccinated. means 1/15 population responsible 1/4 cases. account protection infection.
Your 16% vs 6% means 60 CATCH covid 2.66 times less likely severely ill vaccinated. yeah. particularly sucks people really judgmental cavities literally always fault. borderline victim blaming ""studies"" Fox News hosts far right podcasts say good. good. Mask vaccine bad bad Psh that’s drastic oversimplification. 

I mean, might taking dog dewormer.  ""I hope doctors remember, southern man need vaccines anyhow"" country police allowed arrest break law? New Zealand isn’t stupid.

My state requiring medical personnel vaccinated exemption (which unfortunately allows religious idiots), might wait  seemed like claime chiropractic care legitimate employ scientific method treatments though [this article] seems say otherwise. article seems say chiropractic care effective relieving lower back pain, neck pain, even headaches.  need study. 3 words. Lower Viral Load. Swine flu 2.0 Patients say? Chuck idiots hospital. right take valuable hospital space medic time deserving patients. possible verify people’s vaccination status though? Could lie say lost vaccine card? bad parents seem fucking stupid make competent decisions Studies say may extra protection, much comfort anxiety unfortunately *Dr. McElyea said patients suffering nausea, vomiting, muscle aches cramping, that’s minor cases.*

*“The scariest one I’ve heard seen people coming vision loss,” said.*   gotta think there's microchips animal versions. tricks them, government swapped non chipped animal chipped versions 2 weeks ago.   Argh bad looking good we're woods yet. let even one case slip past us we'll place beginning lockdown. get wrong, favor lockdown completely support it. early start patting back yet. responding planets would better. Means needed 6 fingers count income bruh

my dad sees chiropractic, theyve done wonders back

u cant dismiss entire industry like basis foundation valid point. rebuttle would say number tests decreasing number exposures decreasing, along number people could possibly infected. leaves close contacts new cases, people possible new exposure sites (less past, fewer positives) people feeling well.

Unfortunately Delta, we've already seen single case days community. hope wipe - least long enough get everyone vaccinated brace medical infrastructure impact finally open borders.  Maybe stick tonic water benefit. idiot would steal animal’s drugs? Butbutbut seen Facebook Fauchi said big deal!!!!!!!11111 Thank you. Pandemic caught without primary care, clueless. Good know case. least given chiropractors aren’t real doctors.  ridiculousness leadership Nevada. 

More 4,000 people apply? 3,000 2,000 1,000 safe? Obviously people, safer... amiright? /s

It seems fairly obvious two things happen. 1, people fake proof vaccination possibly show infected. 2, people attendance likely vaccinated person show breakthrough case. propagate cases, almost certainly. form contact tracing able carried 4,000+ attendees, probably not.  Unvaccinated. Natural selection. Thank clearing gene pool  think governor Arkansas said something it, Facebook feed exploded. People trust know whether 1/3 1/4 bigger suddenly going figure correct proportion horse dosage (hint horses vary weight much human), try weight correct amount (with food scale probably), figure correct frequency duration dosage. 

Why? Go fucking doctor want shit. dont fucking care. fuck buying pet stores? insurance fucked America people buying this, COVID, can't afford co pay?

Also, mind boggling, afford copay, paying animal medicine specifically animals,if CONCERNED stretching wallet, get free fucking vaccine? state would leave.

50% shitty airplane passengers come there.

YOLO, pick better state lol Dunno we're pretty bad inbreeding here, hard differentiate CoViD effects I’m trying find stats Nevada. I’m seeing 12.2% kids 10-19 least one shot. even fully vaxxed. Wonder that’s accurate. would explain kid one two know vaxxed. pleasant cooperative would-be patients got vaccinated. ones coming got nightmare. Imagine governor keeps pushing back fueling fire there--like standing schoolhouse doorway--until president send National Guard help usher mask wearers schools. Uranus constellation, buddy... hahaha... idiot suckers whole lot I'm sure people downvoting telling truth something town.

However, pretty strange hear chiropractors physical therapists coexisting. father-in-law chiropractor several friends physical therapists. gather talking chiropractors physical therapists really respect other. FIL kind holier thou vibe talking PT's PT friends think chiropractic BS.

After spending good amount time people worlds, wholeheartedly agree PT's. whole business model chiropractic basically this. ""Adjust"" people temporary feeling relief, knowing actually fixing anything sell importance regular chiropractic visits. ""Doctor, saw two days ago neck already feels bad again."" ""Well that's neck alignment need come 2-3 days week. Eventually it'll get better. also need continue coming preventative adjustments twice month. Also buy supplements I'm selling front desk become super hero.""

PT actually legitimate practice, actual hospitals employ physical therapists. ""manipulations"" help range motion, also things legitimately strengthen body help recover injuries. It’s really not. senseless though? 

Makes sense unvaccinated dying lethal virus First Amendment abused. Roll tide! Interesting little fact go along this, find businesses like sites like Google Maps, Trip Advisor, Yelp, etc. even leave reviews them! cool that? phrenologist read bumps head gave lollipop! Yes, thanks. read earlier thought odd wouldn’t explicitly mention dentists. British Columbia, Canada, announcement vaccine passport convinced many vaccine hesitant get vaccinated. numbers shot significantly. 

Only herd immunity protect can't get vaccinated need around 90% 12yo need approved vaccine get there. paying this? are, either federal government (if they're still covering it) insurance, certainly see increases. surprised find referred podiatrist GP ingrown toenail years back. also wasn’t covered public health care (in Canada), ended paying $600 guy cut chunk toe. covered work insurance like dental eye care. Agree everything forgiving loans. Let pay every last cent back actually graduated place. They’re impersonating anyone qualification don’t have. They’re saying they’re saying allowed get away it. shut thankfully, tried misrepresent MD might get criminal least civil charges.  Yeah. still reuse mask entire shift (but get extras fairly easily now). also wear cloth one surgical one fits badly face unless weird looping thing around ears, causes cuts ears.

I’m beyond this. “pro life” governor make sure kill many born people possible ignoring science ignoring need upgrade electrical infrastructure. winter storm sucked ass. would fine didn’t go beyond third world cut power chunks Texas damn near week. need go I'm lazy. I'm vaccinated also COVID January. Going anywhere annoying days. sure long COVID I'm always tired anxious Viruses souls too. Prove wrong. Well, don’t *count* them, think? Breaking news: science journals longer accepting papers young earth creationists.  MPH here, confirm. Lots ethics classes thanks horrible people past. COVID patients breathing stops, writhe? die?  Cant report outbreak track *taps head* [The press mention dentists hygienists specifically, seems imply they're included new public health orders require designated provincial public service workers ongoing contact vulnerable populations, especially children, fully immunized submit testing three times per week. Designated workers include:
• direct health-care providers workers, including limited physicians, nurses, allied health professionals, support service staff others deemed appropriate site/area/program **public private health-care settings**, **direct care providers defined anyone may come contact patients/residents/clients, patient/resident/client care environments, patient/resident/client care equipment, blood body fluids;** atheist… Jesus fucking Christ. 
We talking death percentage, hospitalized never again, what’s percentage that? Look many people abandoned ""deeply held objections"" &amp; ""freedom"" minute created form personal inconvenience.

Just goes show reasons complete bullshit along.

When protect others, dig every excuse. selfish purpose, they're happy throw excuses away heartbeat.

So future reference carrot works smart folks stick others. dunno dislocated 3 ribs bronchitis chiropractor put back fairly well people heard saying, ""where there's smoke, there's fire."" 1 case turned whole lot community tested coming days. Thank goodness lockdown hard fast horse bolted, unlike faffing happened New South Wales.  seems alternative medicines little difficult properly test.

Now, “crazy” chiros say cases missing underwear caused underwear gnomes…
But don’t go “crazy” chiros, chiro isn’t quack! knows missing due getting lost house, dryer, gym bags, etc.
Only small percentage actually stolen gnomes.

""Excellent.""  old you? good chunk people 80+ don‘t properly develop neutralizing antibodies vaccination Biontech (or vaccine), people 60 rare thing. 60, likely excellent protection severe disease don‘t need booster yet. wonder happen ones left - majority, anyway - stupid enough keep putting lying shit. distribution network set up

What mean? Distribution network definitely setup Trump agree buy doses.
 
Well advance. three countries world UK,US Israel..

I'd last defend Trump's anything. distort basic facts either. That's terrible program. made better, would popular. theorized kids, since MMR (specifically Mumps) titers higher older people. label ""extremists"" others labels like context current times. lot liberal progressive ideals considered extreme times well.

I understand blocking groups advocate violence, yea clearly message, made mind going close minded NYT reports hawaii 55% vaccination rate considered ""very high""? seems pretty middling

62 cases per 100k per day considered ""very high""? again, seems pretty middling chart compared rest country. 

let's try hospitalizations next, surely ""very high"" \*checks notes\* 31/100k, tucked right tourist destinations arizona indiana true sure dentists dental hygienists equally concerned patients vaccinated...but let us harass dentists dental hygienists Ignore.

Ron DeSantis. said customers purpose. 

Proud stand u/bisexualqueef .... wait...I'm sure uncomfortable Lockdowns work people really believed kids couldnt get covid smh mention people talk problems, animals cant.  wonder medical community medically ignorant areas going start abandoning states droves. assume day conditions, amazing people probably near breaking point. crazy ""journalist"" writing article like horror story... need state read whole thing, id imagine propaganda used. Im anti vaxxer, guy nurses family opinions available article definitely targeted make middle aged people really uncomfortable unless agenda writer unfortunate. Get dont get worry yourself.  Thanks response. real way see ending, added bonus flu-covid shot introduced. Although unfortunately think we'll slow punch mandates states. We're pretty much stuck cycle hospitals stop getting filled up. vaccinations natural immunity get us eventually. Perhaps booster two well. True regardless charged we’re still paying taxes. Yes, it’s equivalent practicing animals. emergency surgeons, would let vet operate me? Damn straight would- even medical doctor without surgery experience. Vet school much harder get med school, GP wouldn’t know much surgery vet experience. Since care evidence? $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ Nice! stop listening vaccine mask misinformation optamalogist So, tolerate dad jokes *and* mom jokes? Honestly, wrong parents? COVID-19 health issue parents concerned health children, especially young vaccinated. want schools closed many students teachers become infected? Muuuuuuve Delta Thank advice :)

We supplement vitamin getting flu vaccines later month. keep waiting someone challenge it, still stands signs anything changing. Basically impossible prove got sick due complete total lack contact tracing almost every open business committing massive violations basic safety protocols. Georgia absolutely requirements businesses, events 1000+ maskless unvaccinated people indoors incredibly common 6 months. I've gone chiropractors helped back, placebo effect something? Though I'm sure would giving mask exemptions. mom nurse Covid floor hospital since March 2020. said hardest part many times patient would seem fine, they’d talking coherent - hour later they’d coding. 

My mom resilient woman. She’s worked nurse 35 years, done ICU ER work, headed several NICUs done CPR barely even born infant babies. 

I never life seen mom ragged sad defeated witnessed last year. 

Luckily mom’s mental health got job teaching nursing school, still panic moments hears beeping even remotely resembles code sound. Probably not. vets probably know science average doctor given it’s much difficult get vet school med school. need least 2 share, rude. say low back pain? Haha. guess. Every old person low back pain think. 

Weirdly, though, one little stories asking around pain neck/head/shoulders pretty specific points. chiropractor felt neck bones, told one twisting little certain way (can verify feels uneven), thought asked tv computer screen left sitting look it. said time spend much time either. next week realized favor looking left; sit people's right side turn head talk, angle twist little chairs looking way, even sleep chin closer left shoulder. corrected posture habits pains basically went away. taught pay attention ergonomics. yes, certain joint misaligned certain way one knew enough figure also myself. I’m going ask (nor would expect actually shown) vaccination card everyone room lay mouth wide open almost hour. regardless vaccination status, still possible (seemingly less likely) catch spread COVID. 

Therefore, I’m going dentist, member household, 3 year old fully vaccinated. 

Sorry dentists. know don’t lead them? know, assume secretary does— concerned? Chiropractor:Physical Therapist

The left column might help people sometimes, represent facsimile counterpart right column, less (or zero) training, less (or zero) oversight, less (or zero) continuing education.  ""Working bone structure back alignment"" accomplished chiropractic care. may ""prescribe"" exercises patients get home strengthen supporting muscles quackery office voodoo potentially harmful. specialist m.d. physical therapist needed people seeking.  always chiropractors? medical doctors, PAs, NPs state (and maybe coroner perchance doctor, though that's rare) sign death certificates. underestimated extent locked - 120 upper number clear higher - otherwise they've gotten data they've good. Apparently we've invested absolute fortune researching modeling. government decisions driven data to.  Oh need watch John Oliver God one us go year (which dentist said fine based personal tooth gum health)... Last year due go right pandemic hit. rescheduled got vaccinated year later. Glad got delta went nuts (especially knew one small cavity), cause feel great right now. oooo...I know one person doesnt like Mom 4 6 month old. 

Breastfeeding best thing little one, without vaccine. vaccine, shown pass along antibodies. Breastmilk works way sicknesses, too. Keep breastfeeding least 1. 

You get 6 month old vaccinated flu appear now.

Make sure getting enough vitamin D. Spending time sun best way, take supplement give drops baby. 

If want, consider babywearing versus carseat stroller. People way less likely touch baby face without face. worked well me. 

Try worry much. Kids get sick (in general) normal. I’ll admit makes hate TINY bit less. Fred marries Wilma Lots people got vaccinated $100 Harris county introduced recently. There's plenty people care either way, unless they're given incentive. could probably get lot people nationally getting shots got another stimulus check, dependent vaccinated.  one reasonable posts I've ever seen. Bravo sir. Yes, Pierre!   way. people ward obese

Sorry say, yet another reason it’s hitting American South bad. Obese + unvaxxed like covid’s favorite thing, even lot kids young people very, large. ACLU suing. district even offering virtual immunocompromised kids. daughter supposed start kindergarten, claps hand jumps excitement thinning it. year chemo tell I'm home schooling bc can't exposed. got schrodingers cancer right now- might might check blood 5 years see. refuse expose brother. fucking months away approval risking lives. “I don’t think Billy leukaemia, I’ll treat oregano instead chemicals” skeptical view chiropractors this. ""gestures'""behind emphasis'  kids able get monoclonal treatment? kids young vaccine I'm going freak catch covid. know risk low parents freak anytime kids sick.    guarantee covid become less deadly harmful currently time.

The virus likely vaccination previous infection extremely effective preventing severe disease (that requiring hospitalization) death. repeated exposure keep immune system primed.

We get endemic stage everyone either vaccinated infected, we're yet. I'm sadly shocked Florida's numbers, really wondering state react 2020/2021. wear n95 go stores tons unmasked kids running around. state go mask free you’re vaccinated, it’s clear parents don’t think applies children old enough wear mask, old enough vaccinated. guy’s brother least trying help without sugar-coating bad situation. 

“While appreciate prayers brother understand that’s feel they’re helping, would ask know, use help God already given stay situation.” Lol nope!

Florida currently among worst hit states country. whole “We're #22!” BS want pull whole history rather looking urgent numbers. 

Florida basically Uncle Rico peaked high school. mask can't literally blow away insect hand. clearly blocks lot allowing proper respiration. Suddenly though, spitting/coughing people anymore, think makes great difference (if ever sneezed know many droplets throws). Even talk emits droplets aerosol. Masks limitations surely miss efficacy sort worst case scenario. believe exactly coming. horrific gets depends quickly people start responding horror getting vaccinated quickly delta burns unvaccinated population. Maybe take 3 weeks, maybe take winter. question point long nightmare go on. cancelled checkup 2 weeks ago receptionist evasive dentists’/hygienists’ vaccination status. days later, province (Manitoba) announced **firm** vaccine mandate deadline health care employees (and others), including dental practices, confidently rebook month (I’m vaccinated). So, that’s good. don’t want someone rummaging around mouth 30 minutes yammering new deck doesn’t think good idea.  Every country admitted hiding mask efficiency allow health care workers wrre produced back then.

They idea deadly new pandemic gonna be, since china gave shady numbers.
So course could afford lose many health care workers civilians would followed. Yeah ""both"" correct answer. Individuals get vaccination infection, communities get proportion either. ones going towards infection route much worse time. test good quality one like PCR test. zero symptoms. it’s ok, still wear mask stay 6 feet everyone outside home. always knew “May live interesting times” curse. much visceral understanding it.

I enjoyed reading things like 1918 flu pandemic Black Plague, finding spread countries cities reacted them. Plague doctor masks previous professions, called Spanish flu, Philadelphia parade, kinds interesting things.

Don’t think I’ll ever again. husband's ex-step-dad chiropractor. son colic torticollis. suggested hold son upside feet realign torticillis colic anymore! looked like crazy said hell no.

But I’d guess it’d ok playing sports. usually wear cloth mask mine genetics. eat clean diet, lots water, little sugar, soda, oral B brush, floss use prescription toothpaste constantly. least one cavity year, like mom.

Idk dad even knows floss looks like, brushes day mangled old toothbrush, eats tons candy sugar coffee, hadn’t dentist since Bush admin. first cavity 2019, age 63.

It’s bullshit. earlier today, Worldometers, Florida's peak number deaths (7-day moving average) entire pandemic 227, last August. peak latest wave 221 around August 16. 

But check right now, pandemic peak 245 two weeks ago: August 17. agree you.

I poking fun use ""alternative"", all. “What deaths?” - Ron DeSantis  Chiropractors real doctors.  sister went chiropractor neck pain once. immediately gave referral neurologist. Turns MS.  Yesssssss!!!! I've always found odd unhelpful way calculating effectiveness vaccine

I downloaded Excel table dashboard analysis:

* 1,438 unvaccinated over-60s covid
* 4,023 vaccinated over-60s covid
* 223 unvaccinated over-60s seriously ill, meaning 16% chance unvaccinated over-60 fall seriously ill
* 230 vaccinated over-60s seriously ill, meaning 6% chance vaccinated over-60 fall seriously ill

So chance getting seriously ill catch covid reduced 16% 6% fully vaccinated Enough crazy deplorables; go back rock!  learned decades ago high school biology class, graphic pictures all. teacher also NIH researcher used object lesson experiment ethics. positively Orwellian time approved kids gotten COVID, especially school starting. kept kids home last year, feel like I'm throwing wolves sending school. know do.

who 'we'  problem many vaccinated people getting Covid. personally know Covid survivors weathered disease fine, get violently ill moths later vaccinated. treatment can't worse disease. know several people never covid got vaccinated. 

If vaccine stopped disease reliably, everyone would want it, want now. really point one keeps seeing people seemingly protection.  saw comment replied well, awesome work. clinical trials direction Ian Osterloh suggested drug little effect angina, could induce marked penile erections.[54][55] Pfizer therefore decided market erectile dysfunction, rather angina; decision became often-cited example drug repositioning.[56][57]

But go on…  I’m sure much extrapolate anecdotes.  South Africa first. name credibility chiropractor. people terrified kids eating Tide Pods. Unless something outcompetes delta many versions actually spread cause significant harm. Canadian: Bacon, pepperoni, mushrooms, extra cheese 👌

That's I'm tonight, hot wings garlic bread. Looking forward it!  Congratulations getting healthier!

I’m scientist, understanding age (being young 0-4) highly protective, pretty far young side spectrum there. Vaccines also highly protective severe case hospitalization. Absolutely one zero risk, two major factors side. 

Or looking Oklahoma’s data past 30 days page 10, 4 fully vaccinated people 18-35 hospitalized COVID state. doesn’t necessarily mean ICU, let alone ventilator death. Again, guarantees, would guess least couple worse underlying conditions have. 

I suggest (like everyone) exercise reasonable caution. personally would choose wear protective mask public regardless health status, age, etc. unless doctor says otherwise, wouldn’t worry severely bad outcomes vaccinated.  month ago, positive. Can’t help wonder position Pfizer board affecting tone. saying is, conflict interest sure seems odd became less optimistic boosters became thing. But, charitable, could also seen data worried him. Yes. Piles respiratory visited exist, they're largely harmless, generally ignore them. Yes, like 200. don’t care, easily reduce exposure anyways. find stores empty opening near closing time. Give wide space parks, it’s pain this. Question triage: hospitals reach point overwhelmed needing triage people, would non-self-inflicted harm prioritized self-inflicted harm?

Put another way: things already bad, hospitals already needing delay care people. systemic triage implemented, would ivermectin idiots turned away idiots hurt themselves, favor people like gunshot victims came harm fault own? gave emergency use authorization almost evidence, Ivermectin would already FDA approved now. submission removed either repost, clickbait low quality submission.

Wow, TIL... LMAO liberal mindless robots believe anything media tells This. HL7 language, data format.  standard says name goes here, birth date goes here, etc.

Just every health care software system uses it, least version 2  used reporting.  operational stuff sending specific data like this. 

It'd ok use purpose, standard sorts. use reporting one like build report system's reporting mechanism convert HL7.  

Where falls standard different systems define use fields differently  account number per visit vs. patient identifier etc. 

From reporting standpoint, Covid defined system?  new patients, existing patients, time frames, etc. etc. selection criteria might seem obvious high level, quickly gets mired nuance.

[Miami-Dade County Public Schools \(M-DCPS\) fourth largest school district country. 2017, 356,000 students 18,000 

15 teachers dying tragic, losing 15 18,000 going cripple school system. 

And given time needed Covid incubate progress point kills working-age adult, teachers probably infected school year started. Yes, need follow Australia's example overnight 1984 policy. Scientific surviellience networks operate around world collect data variants coronavirus. seems highly unlikely variant raging US remains unrecognized. simpler explanations health crisis regions US. justed searched find saw study people likely get ""Covid shot"" ""Covid vaccine"". Respondents thought shot safer vaccine.

The actual word ""vaccine"" becoming poisoned due idiots.  somebody please think millionaires :( fucking embarrassing sheer amount adults playing ""I can't even card"" pretending done got shot kids wear mask ignore possible life changing disease we're exhausted easy lives whole lives. Who’s triggered again? Lol.

And far claim done “research” know I’m going see another example Dunning-Kruger effect. didn’t disappoint. migraines dissipate chiropractic isn’t proof anything except maybe validation helps somatic symptoms, already stated. Since seem think sick talking doctor non-medical doctor say things align doctor make us knowledgeable (they don’t): suffer rare migraine syndrome rare neurological syndrome. go team top neurologists field. far consider qualifiers (I don’t) , guess we’re even ground.

I never said cure migraine; allowing possibility experienced remission took cure, point comment, didn’t pursue it.

To save time confusion, please feel free *explicitly quote* untrue statement I’ve made directly comment. won’t that, I’ll assume projected something onto words nothing me, and/or mistook another user.  mean arent medical professionals? 

And claim anti-flu adjustments effective flu vaccine bunk?

shockedpikachu.jpg. Sars-1 also came bats, also respiratory, eradicated humans.

It's impossible, seem like less likely scenario. Seems least 2-4 weeks third shot, seem effective preventing infection. technically US officially giving yet except people least effective in. many people gotten anyways. enough make worth places can't make requirement given know long last probably third shots general populace yet either, would hypocritical.

Again, I'm REALLY trying sound like anti-vaxx moron...I'm trying better equip arguments family fully understand people mean tell folks vaccine's negative side-effects would already discovered. They've primarily used Pfizer. 75% Pfizer, 25% Moderna. fucked kids need ones bring attention something? Completely disagree, here. ~~Kids need school, period.

So hiring problem also retention problem. Cuz pay low work sucks. year intense PT shoulder injury, 6 month prior surgery 6 months after. therapist would stretch neck would gently pop better comfortable chiro adjustment ever had. 

There’s dude FB videos puts harness around peoples’ heads chin, yanks 10” across table, I’m like “how earth decide safe?” think custom use title ""Dr"" jds least lifetime people reading ""ivermectin cured me"" stories? seen one anywhere. care people actually cured taking political reasons? Yes. spreading it. Studies show precious assumptions kids get spread wrong. get spread equally well adults. tend typical asymptotic. cases go up, incidents symptomatic cases. fine. appeal decision ignore judge's order waiting appeal. Business normal Florida government. Yes, seem remember Dr John Campbell mentioning YouTube videos back. know totally anecdotal people know gotten vaccinated, 1- got 1st dose, 1- got covid hospitalized (luckily mend hard regrets it), rest never say find employment job requires it. one ths hospital antivax know, anxious never got around vaccinated expected bad healthy 40 yr old. started okay declined probably lifelong lung damage. got lucky need vented. pretty sure got unvaccinated daughter started person school. daughter slight fever, luckily husband vaccinated never got it. truly wish adults getting vaccinated, unfortunately percentage population never it. hope become fewer fewer goes on. Found answer: districts Warren county.

Disappointed, surprised. Pfizer seems worse post 6 months AZ. Early data Canada England showing great short term protection, ass long term protection... 

But literally billions people parts world want vaccine get hand on. is? 90%? 100%? one go like mixture PT. yeah lot scummy ones appears even 90-95% sufficient, herd immunity might possible virulent newest strains are, coupled reinfection breakthrough infections. newer type vaccines hope reduce transmission, even testing yet.   Probably important bit 52.7% total US population fully vaccinated. 10 states worst Covid-19 case rates past week, seven also among 10 best vaccination rates, [according US Centers Disease Control Prevention. Participants’ informed consent collected. 

This first paragraph?  comes Mu variant. different original virus variants be, without finally considered different virus? factor play? Thanks. virus endemic, it’s going anywhere. It’s best accept fact everyone get COVID point you’re fully vaccinated, symptoms won’t worse cold mild flu.  need counter medicine... Basically, Chickasaw Nation already administering booster shots, others gearing go soon get green light. feds make real decision booster shot guidelines can't tell tribes/IHS it.    Unfortunately dad also tested positive COVID. Right ok also fully vaccinated. Thank taking time explain this. guess part I'm still bit unclear sure one immune system responses, occurs 2-4 weeks vaccine body, manifest way show testing immediately, might show months years road? 

I trust researchers scientists, got vaccinated day available me, there's something clicked one point... basically promise us nothing bad happen already happen. back hurt anymore right? /s Damn thanks assuring credibility fake medicine. didn’t know believe. child currently school due covid exposure. got tested Wednesday, haven’t gotten results back. 

We live SC, goes school without mask mandates. students “distanced” kids sitting clusters 3- someone group 3 COVID it’s pretty much guarantee 2 children get well. son masked whole time, know provides base level protection. unable get vaccinated, he’s 8. 

His exposure happened Friday August 27, notified Wednesday September 1. school 30,31 1st- although half day literally leave work go pick school finding classmate tested positive. 
There way stop spread type system. There’s system. send kids school hope pray don’t get covid, meanwhile get covid they’re still potentially spreading days. 

The school nurse told aren’t even reporting things directly SC DHEC anymore, report district guess school district shares info health department. idea. 

I know isn’t sustainable. going happen get fall/winter months? many children become sick hospitalized Governor gives shit? Maybe McMaster would care children still inside woman’s uterus. truly staying condo going beach really isn’t different. includes bars restaurants near beach, thats pretty bad. allowing 6 yr olds get covid vaccine? Pls least sone good news things slightly better soon? Im super bad news still attitude kind crazy though. Flip want, getting vaccine medical procedure risks side-effects. must well-founded risk-benefit assessment tells good idea really it.

This currently exists two doses vaccine, still kind unclear three doses population.

""The better"" insane talk. I'm saying. national licensure board, FSBPT, governed board PTs, PhD, JD, RNs. Chiropractor's national examination board nothing DC one lawyer certifying DCs. call “chiro-quack-ters.” Hmm. would probably work wife set face. Still, something schools really do. amount legal trouble take try fight “medical” note probably worth circumstances.  16 older, lot people younger that. think vaccine kind like class immune system takes - inundated new information, takes continues study next couple months. conflict teacher it'll arise class itself, school's memories knowledge gained. There’s probably 12,000 rns deployed well math earth get voted asking question? Reddit weird. 70-80% isn’t sufficient herd immunity. Astrognome. They'll mindlessly ingest substance, afraid masks? question. Can't back pain can't feel anything shoulders. Calling someone ""crockpot"" is...

...a slow burn.  Bag full m&amp;m’s. 1 m&amp;m bag poisonous could serious health consequences possibly kill you. 4 m&amp;m’s cause long term health issues. rest fine!

I’m vaxxed, masked teacher. risks don’t want take asked work 100% unvaxxed portion population - children - small classroom terrible ventilation. love job I’m great educator signed for. risks seems unreasonable. 

It true - many kids asymptomatic (and not). people spread also lucky? I’d hate eat bag m&amp;m’s. There’s “cure”, genius. Again, you’re talking topic know nothing except spew you’ve “heard”. 

Oh, know? 95% time, migraines dissipate go away within hour 2 chiropractic visit. Without adjustment, go days, sometimes week. also parallel conversations neurologist &amp; sTrAngELy EnOuGh, information chiro jives neurologist. 

Talk topics know about, ok?  Tell people fell “basically” gap. masked extended face-to-face contact, possible exposed small amounts virus. Even Delta, odds still favor vaccine kept infected! That's good! layman's explanation pregnant women actually face risks covid. 

The risk higher, safety studied pregnancy vaccines, still ongoing kids. non issue two different scenarios.   astrologist, astrologer? don’t know called.

If want follow future VOC's, watch yourself, news. Delta seen coming since May, Lambda obviously never going anywhere, just-named Mu (21H) lineage besides Delta outgrown Gamma country. Coronavirus sweeping world God's will, destined kill 100 million people. effort stop/slow spreading, seek medical treatment getting infected, God's will.

If God wants die, go die. visit hospital, take ER bed ICU bed.

Btw, believe God, got vaccinated, ware masks wherever among people. God protect me, myself. Every single county Oklahoma gone R presidential candidate since 2004. last candidate win county Al Gore. let die.

I mean gunshot victims. share opinion.  honestly want 3rd shot redo jumpstart social life. I've 3 weddings friends/colleagues canceled/dis-invited due scaling back face Delta. Even return part-time office hours abruptly halted, set date target come back in. like California waiting limbo see there's going Winter Surge.  thought illegal drug use HUGE DEAL USA, fill prison people buying / selling / using drugs illegally. kind criminals? get treatment gunshot victim

What gunshot victim gang shootout? evaluate deserving: person chugged horse dewormer gang shootout participant? One could argue made poor decisions. gang shootout participant could shot people too... 

And make determination live ER waiting room people bleeding out? decides? appeal? judges lawyers? minorities poor going deprioritized wealthy? 

Triage happens base subjective judgement person ""deserving"". reason DeSantis bans masks etc. makes money every sick person.

Somebody holds stock ivermectin/etc makes money, course Fox News pushes it. always grift. Protein subunit.  Venn diagram people stupid enough treat horse dewormer also circle people stupid calculate proper dosage  That's triage works, sorry. ""choose"" gets treated first, choice determined viability patients. Medicine practice moralizing, matter much folks try make so. People desperate show ""free"" they'll exact opposite advised, they're paranoid trust judgement accept it. irony likely easily manipulated troll taking poison, exact thing thought government them.  Things dairy taste bad sick (at least experience). haven’t covid illness years ago jacked sense taste smell, things could eat didn’t taste awful potato-based (fries, mashed potatoes, potato chips, etc). Rice may taste ok too. avoid dairy meat.  getting meds? Gotta imagine 99.9% doctors mot prescribing bs smell, come surprise FDA approved vaccines 16 older. factory talking about? Anyone fucking stupid enough actually take Ivermectin admittable hospital ODing. going willingly stupid, deal consequences take resources needed real, non self-induced issues.  wonder would work make ""suppressed"" vaccine that's another mrna one advertise, internet weirdos feel like found secret.  anything hugs. I'm sorry can't imagine difficult see mother go 🤍 That's though, first come first serve assume beds forever ethical decision. easy one assuming going run problem. problem now, assumption they'll ""find bed"" going manifest. guy dies waiting room, make ethical decision? follow easy protocol that's result? don’t eat Viagra pills treat lumbago. totally understand coming I'm right levels frustration.

BUT, doctors typically consider whether got stupid ass situation treating you. did, nobody would ever get items removed anus get blown fingers fixed playing fireworks. We're there. UT crashed, call National guard. Ballad 'virtual"" hospitalization. ER wait times hours long. suspect many patients ""bed"" much else. Nobody really knows what's going Israel.

They vaccinated. Coming August 1.27 doses per population, reasonably high, nearly under-18 vaccinations (essential Delta) large antivax pockets. They've given lot doses last month, boosters first doses younger people, take time effect.

Their cases risen quickly unclear CFR is. UK 0.2%, 95% adult seropositivity along similar low immunity rate under-18s. US 1-2%, many times seronegative vulnerable people, vaccinations among 12-17s, less testing. Israel cases risen quickly guess.

Israel gave everyone second pfizer dose exactly 3 weeks, possible simply give bad result require later booster. unlike US, many doses 4+ weeks, UK 8-12 weeks (far superior). giving boosters now.

They're 1.6 doses per capita now, matching Uruguay essentially zero covid.  continue give new doses rapidly. One would hope cases start falling soon. mean they're showing ER exact time; people already Ivermectin symptoms admitted, later Jimbo John-boy comes there's room him. 

Sucks. ""An vitro trial shown ivermectin reduces number cell-associated viral RNA 99.8 % 24 hours. vitro study study cells laboratory living ‘smarter’ ones probably napkin math calculate think right dose they’re still dumb math properly would peak eventually enough people get vaccinated natural immunity infection. Sounds like need new sources. It’s easy fact verify. Google Florida Covid hospitalizations chart. magnitudes

Well, least get back right receiving second dose. got first Pfizer dose México :), literally fastest could've gotten shot lol, fully vaxxed rich country grateful cuz millions us desperate get it. politicize alternative accepting liberals right getting vaccinated taking basic precautions avoid virus.

Their ego incredibly, fantastically fragile wrapped lunatic identity politics can't possibly accept political opponents right - means admitting years conspiracy theories, assumptions accusations Democrats might flawed. saying weeks, makes news, showing ER. damn Streisand effect.. 

Our cases continue rise, shy peak hit January far hospitalizations go. Honestly, thought last year / early year would worst.. childrens hospital completely full month, got people going Tractor Supply company medications, one learning damn thing this. 

Craziest thing heard week? ""why wear mask, already Covid.. cant breathe!""

Gotta love Oklahoma.. classy!  Hi, used triage pediatric ER.

Triage process determine medical necessity. priority determined medical need, dumb OD get shot. Someone non-life threatening GSW, get lower priority someone coding overdose.

The medical profession make moral value judgements people's medical condition. going enslave Covid starve it?  350,000 children eligible. 12% age however decision contrary evidence reason

They gave evidence reason, expert try job experts JCVI suggest decision evidence reason idiotic. us vaccinated... gonna lie, there's popcorn grabbing lowest common denominator offs itself.   I'm familiar usa's way counting data. However, appears talking apples oranges. interested UK data, I'm massively interested trawling USA data. however, demonstrated UK appear large risk covid age group. hence JVCI said ""Of course vaccines work would beneficial children terms preventing infection disease, number serious cases see COVID children age really small,""  Here's idea - triage fuckers ivermectin fucking parking lot GSW people get treatment.  demonstrated complete morons able cut front others “now need help.” Fuck em

What kinds behavior cause someone deprioritized? decides behavior cause someone deprioritized? evaluate someone bleeding waiting room? judge? transparency? appeals? 

We condition medical treatment based deserve not. Triage happens, based nurse/doctor thinks idiot not. feel like humanity's going downhill. Right we've got pandemic, climate change breaking records wars happening human rights violated. even focus on? selfish could end least pandemic slightly quickly people could get heads asses 5 seconds. Amusingly, bet it’s going antimaskers antivaxxers lack semblance respect others society. Unfortunately, think folks feel desperate misguided enough probably worried reputation drug. Ok but.. lot gunshot victims rural Oklahoma? Can’t say feel sorry able vaccinated didn’t want it. Sad, made choice. Yep, vaccines working basic measures asking restaurants bars close early serve booze + people wearing masks intended effect again. (people Japan) took Delta punch face we're getting back up.

Anyone believe vaccines work need take good hard look Japan's data. obvious numbers declining even face Delta. like adults work, kids go school.  Oklahoman here….gun violence really risen since 2016 really thought borderline urban legend / media hyperbole doctor friend told patients taking  Vaccinated not, wonder? Hard make much news without piece info. Free chance delta every ticket! Stone Mountain? Seriously? monument confederacy? think Sam's club limit chicken while, due shortages months ago. also ""limit 2"" signs scattered around, possibly items sale though.

It's matter time social distancing limited capacity come back. even former president get followers get vaccinated.  thing losing dog. I’m done them. amplify anything negative vaccines minimizing explaining away obvious realities covid.  Real shitbag moves past year ask me. people like you, noisy kids things make wfh impractical, maybe local business space could converted ‘shared workspace’ places. folks take short trip whatever suitable one nearest them. Companies could pay rental manage office space issues themselves. could also occasionally rent meeting spaces meetings needed. past 18 months parents isolating kids seeing anybody? Ya that’s going problem. 

One data sets date yesterday. stands current data driving kids 10x dangerous kids getting covid. parents drive kids places irresponsible? read past first paragraph also see benefits ""immesurable"" used River Blindness, Lymphatic Filariasis, Malaria too. Also, see FDA approved? tried searching find anything saying approved.

We going get full shut down.

But week gives time deal physicality school - air surfaces, hopefully school board mandate masks. think worth recognizing rare possibility seems like people getting point assume anyone severely ill unvaxxed thus start insulting even taking Facebook pages etc. vast majority deaths severe cases unvaccinated, can't make assumption individual without evidence. arms? die putting horse paste ass, kind deserve it.  believe people given right decide get vaccinated not. takes choice away. last wave masks school.

Scotland (where schools started weeks ago) also stated thinking introducing cases basically skyrocketed since schools back. rest UK schools started week time tell.  drug dealers spread drugs, less people addicted drugs. problem is, can't shut drug dealers.


You shut Fox News Alt-right news organizations. government want to.  Costco already reduced sheet count toilet paper 425 380 highly suspect adults caught mild infection COVID-19 time Anyone read study? normalized hospitalizations per confirmed case? looks like fancy way pointing covid cases ruse south summer religion it? mean, Fentynal cut literal drug dealers heroin, absolutely many cases blame. like buying mary jane laced LSD blaming user smoking LSD. feel solid points.

So claim solid points, knowing get downvoted, instead posting *actual* points free thinking people evaluate them?

I believe you. fight broke ivermectin isle...  can’t imagine using merit decide gets medical care could possibly end terribly… /s idiots want take vaccine dont know what's know long term effects offered medication that's meant get rid worms **horses** gladly take questions asked. 

If ODing without taking hospital beds that's one thing, I'd applaud stupidity yeeting out.. not,, taking hospital beds hospitals already overfilled covid cases refuse get vaccine. added idiots taking horse medication refuse take vaccine. 

If me, hope one day is, I'd deny people medical treatment. Home Depot *should* trust worthy. go 3m ones. Imagine dying treatable gunshot wound someone room temperature IQ took much horse dewormer… use once? dog takes ivermectin (Heartgard) monthly heartworm prevention. I'm thankful Covidiots seem buying horse paste want trouble finding Heartgard. dumbness goes deep. Remember weeks ago paper came supposedly showed spike proteins wound ovaries vaccination? Well, even experts pick paper explicitly tracking spike proteins. tracking specific lipids PEG used make lipid nanoparticle. tracking fats. like 3 orders magnitude fats injection site anywhere else body.

In paper stated tracking spike protein fate spike protein proteolysis. protein. body ace catabolizing protein. proof claim ""it might dangerous"" lie lot people.

I'm Texas know people still worship Blue Bell despite fact knowingly shipped contaminated ice cream caused deaths multiple people. Hell, even telling stores pull shelves people running grabbing potentially contaminated ice cream could.

Many people refuse vaccine ""it might dangerous"". Sadly real reason want seen agreeing Democrats going Republicans/Trump. keep trying things help fight COVID simultaneously trying pretend think fake refuse take measures Democrats agree with. Like, people would rather poison agree Democrat regards science. That's world live right now. happening everywhere, man. article happened Canada. massive anti-mask protests europe. I'm pretty sure someone destroyed 5G tower germany cause thought giving people covid.

The internet made whole world lose minds. Depends are. places like Oklahoma, Texas Florida definitely okay Governors actively trying kill people. don’t feel ones able get vax don’t want it. absolutely feel people like took precautions, probably got someone refuses vaccine. wish strict vaccine mandates. hilarious since they’re never either things Triage shit. Poisoning horse medicine take precedent gun shot victim. True multiple purposes, ivermectin, still shown clinically effective parasites (malaria stemming parasite).

This America. Fuck em, shit intestines die screaming hoax. shut doors bit virus dies down. businesses allowed free money retain staff keep afloat?

is delta strain? thought everything moved much much faster delta little data back 

The fact comment starts highest voted comment thread, sub like absolutely mind boggling. anti-covid conspiracists UK stormed BBC's London headquarters, realising moved Salford decade ago. Let's say people academic Hahahaha, good one! :-) don’t see, medical perspective, two separated. They’re inextricably linked. Emotion drives thoughts drives behavior drives emotion. It’s feedback loop, good way bad way. one changes change. Let eat paste really need send two messages:


1) vaccine safe effective.

2) “The Centers Disease Control Prevention released health advisory last week warning people could become severely ill self-medicating covid vaccine overdosing could cause coma, seizures, death.

That'd hit target 100% vaccinated usa. administration wanted declare July 4th victory end mask wearing. would made sense blatant disregard emerging Delta variant.    got 2 Pfizer moderna booster. side effects still beating 3 days later. experience?  know way end this.

Again, vaccination (or natural immunity) give level immunity prevents hospitalization death. US, it’s something like 80-90% hospitalizations deaths unvaccinated people.

Add free healthcare. people afraid going doctor, seek help earlier, easier treat infections. Masks don’t work, giving kids RSV, causing become suicidal. 

Can stop tying mental health concerns antimasker nonsense? last year almost killed me. couple times. isolation. fear. unrest. feeling tiger trapped cage. lack contact support group. lack person therapy. one instance reason didn’t check hospital thought trapped hospital people pandemic *terrifying* would rather risk safety that. 

These concerns *real*. still wore damn mask stayed inside don’t get put people risk big sad. often act like shitty person (a months ago would said “I may shitty person”, guess that’s progress!) even couldn’t go far, hurt people happiness. distribute vaccine Tractor Supply Company name like Bovectormin also makes sick, maybe it’s thing? even trying continue schooling like point?

1. mean really willfully ignorant science, give shit classes run person still.

2. want continue traditional schooling terrified figure better way educate kids therefore ignorant. population (which want)

3. get rid traditional ideologies, start break lot barriers like...work home (which companies seem HATE even though studies provide positive correlation mental health, work productivity, environment).

Honestly, think refusing change order keep stagnant population. literally working here...it makes sense right? issue people dumb, KNOW doing. really dumb, bigger issue..either way, requires change unwilling do. better hold ""tradition"" industrialized schooling system teach kids rhetoric, need work 8 hours day 5 days week expect work time well. grow desensitized think anything besides work relaxing exhausted.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 curious case numbers seem much lower among healthcare workers example. again, sequence dna show truly infection. different state standards weird. got vaccinated information sent insurance, state registry, medical providers office. also CDC app use track symptoms vaccination. Sure give paper card vaccination status definitely something verified. Jesus progressive people aren’t listening word. They’re stuck Old Testament poor translations. see happening everything white washed. still failed quote dishonest thing said cause reaction. entirely feelings, can’t address, I’m sure I’m supposed beside shake head say, “Well, tried.” stayed home died itd fine jackasses taking hospital beds dumb shit. would think many people concerned would take dewormer, would bother find correct dosage is. people pushing would tell them. Apparently not.  Tell wear mask = freedom violation.

Poison = freedom yeah Murrka. say rare even don’t sequence, simply report two positive tests still quite rare. consider centrist (no party) agree need transparency releasing backup documentation and/or stats data. Covid real deadly, right fear factor. That's drives high ratings 24 hour news, fuels division anger social media, etc. 

As example, 4th grader exposed 4 positive kids last week. quarantined Tuesday. school weak job giving us information someone class tested positive. letters go parents entire school even mention positive cases campus. gets brushed patting back implementing new safety measures, openly measures weeks ago. would appreciate transparent weekly letter school breaking number positive students class, total students positive, total quarantined, number asymptomatic, number sick, number hospital.

I think nothing school believes helping avoid fear/panic, little life experience, feel best give people real transparent information will. Personally, active imagination anxiety scare without actual facts data.

Anyway, glad see board Vax masks, beyond we're trying best sure voted heavily.

Edit spelling Why? see anywhere even considering closing up, even bodies flooding hospitals Clearly we’re happy help life-threatening invaders. else would outside observer characterize response Covid? third country rolling red carpet cheering on, course won’t hurt *them.*   Time buy stocks Serious question: protesting hospitals? medical care?  don’t even get argument since first place they’ll go medical emergency *the hospital* Source? I've seen single case Australia. certainly filling hospitals. flaired Canada. US cornered market idiots unfortunately. think also price thing? 

They thought they'd never get Covid, get it, want hospital bill, try self medicate? especially concerning since saying monoclonal antibody treatments effective given early. went Covid back-to-school training yesterday. Last year, strict rules sanitizing disinfecting surfaces, toys, sports equipment, etc.  


Now, contagious variant going around, *all* kids returning face-to-face classes, school relaxed rules around cleaning. Disinfecting per week good enough, say.  


I feel like there's huge sense futility among staff. Even clean sanitize constantly, masks come snack time lunch, kids required 3 feet apart. masks kids wear, often little, loosely-fitted cotton masks, rather surgical masks.  


It seems inevitable school forced shut within first month school, hourly staff get pay school shuts down, many looking toward industries. Seems entirely likely school shut 10 days time, return, shut again, soon janitors assistant teachers. Murica far understand mean much terms forecasting infection. stands seems one required metric buttload antibodies get infected Delta. Natural immunity wanes vaccine immunity. words 100% people either vaccinated one point another prior COVID still serious outbreak hands.

Sorry, bullshit. 

Again, though, feel free actually link paper showing spinal manipulation (or whatever) person back problem never helps. It’s ridiculous unsupported claim. like claims chiropractic science manipulation help people kidney problems.

Adults realize sometimes grey areas, fact many things chiropractors purport believe false, mean *everything* false. 

Again, haven’t presented actual evidence support point. You’re trying scienc-ey without actually research. Give nature it’s way!  important news, first study (according article) really contemplates serious damage COVID vaccinated individuals.

According study, odds long COVID halved 50% fully vaccinated. great odds, something. LOL think districts using rule vaccinated children. imagine we'll reach point they're ones left school. long stretches time. lol thought sub /r/confidentlyincorrect! First time seen someone get genuine answer people talk new Normal Except worms brains, apparently. therapist uses tapping trauma helped immensely. trauma therapist many years moved process 3-4 traumatic experiences time takes one session EMDR. I'm eight hours work we've done via video chat worked amazingly well. literally like switch flipped brain! 

Don't hesitate seek someone distance away insurance cover well versed TFT. Tapping helped much! Parents/adults around world failing children/their children (of course all, many). 

As someone who's purposefully remained childless life feels *beyond super weird* seem concerned lives children *their damn parents.* UK [that figure yet cases continue trend upwards (and that's schools even returned areas). Delta absolutely brutal, dread think would've like around vaccines. Could dosing interval?  Modern medicine killed lots people however saved loads Maybe could free ERs sending knuckleheads vet.

/s

I browsed conspiracy subreddit sure lot anti-vaxxer/pro-ivermectin fools there. crazyness. Based current situation UK… no, can’t stopped. similar look level immunity 90% (or even 95%, forget) they’ve got even cases do, relatively speaking. climbing. new way Covid works? Cases precede hospitalizations, hospitalizations precede deaths. Generally several weeks between. need live different flu. get masks kids? Buddy, know make clear. 33% board PT credentials whatsoever. Price, Reiter, Hatherill non-PT board members. protect serious disease get breakthrough infection infection act booster you. 

This would fine except risk long COVID. Unless that's also basically zero vaccinated individuals, similar hospitalizations? able find study this.

Edit: first study hit news yesterday. [50% great odds. literally best possible environment disease spread (extremely cramped quarters shared sleeping spaces, low ventilation, immune muting stress sleep deprivation), fully vaccinated military ship (the HMS Queen Elizabeth) sustained spread 100% vaccinated population. 

That said, relatively small spread considering conditions, worst case scenario. Real world spread would harder sustain literally sleeping top other. 

I believe boosters make massive difference. Many highly contagious diseases require three doses mute infection decent period time, even may require boosters every 5 years so. Pragmatically think 6 month booster, annual boosters couple years world still dealing COVID novel disease, switch 5 year schedule except potentially elderly high risk. SARS-CoV-2's ability mutate much limited family flu viruses annual shots may required like flu.

Alternatively, also possible initial set mRNA vaccines, years inactivated COVID virus added annual flu shot. inactivated virus probably sufficient top antibodies sero-positive populations ""extra"" shot beyond hundreds millions already take every year.  Yes no. Facts facts, information like listed present context. high rates new infections highly vaccinated states mostly vaccinated individuals? still unvaccinated population making majority new cases? context, poor reporting. Except haven’t posted “actual science” support far irrational belief nothing chiro useful.  ""im protesting hospital!"". fuck people actually thinking? arguing those. talking faith. Faith nothing believe creationism God created everything. easily say God created universe led big bang. devil's advocate question, far know universe space large existed long us nothing stopping someone feeling way regards higher power. narrow religious views literal sometimes extreme ignorant viewpoint excludes differences make every person every denomination spectrum belief faith whole concept. Nothing black white, trying make so? SC blocked Kerala holding 11th grade mononclonal antibodies, Ivermectin, IV drips cure we'd outta mess.  dose makes poison. elephant dose delivery mechanism water (25 gallons day nose) going end well human, whether Kentucky elsewhere. logically follow Brondo therefore hydration option - plants crave. Proper research manner options help save lives good thing, dietary measures out-of-patent-protection pharmaceuticals. Also yes, keep people harming information science. better worse, real scientific consensus requires time, money yes peer social motivation. Make mistake, actuarial risk evaluation predicting particular vaccines remain safe effective also act faith. takes time, make decisions case without luxury. said, even use Tail Mane horse shampoo, cuz human shampoo. That's they're worried right now, point stop worrying cases look many vaccinated people actually getting severely ill die. Delta transmissible virtually everyone catch matter what, best defense make sure everyone getting vaccinated immune system primed handle it. peer reviewed article NIH. I’m sure link? doubt religious nuts

I seen people criticised schools open get majorly downvoted /r/Coronavirus rarely ever receiving answer embedded logic  Degenerates. get gimmel, get everyone's Covid?  debating, keep news aware controversy. Seems like masks straight brainer. flip side, even good spinal surgeon orthopedic doctor might effective treating back pain either. understand people resort chiropractor. I’ve seeing orthopedic doc 2 years deal severely mobile S.I. Joint, swear want keep hook perform surgery. I’ve done PT. I’ve done pain injections anti-inflammatory injections. Doc spend 2 minutes appointment send pain shots. least chiro spend 20 minutes me, gives massage, makes pain feel valid.

That said stopped seeing last year due obvious; whatever isn’t actually fixing anything all. Thank saying this. many time patient say don’t want take medication it’s found nature. Self medicating depression St. John’s wort Alcohol sure help symptoms, without serious consequences. Checkmate. can't track us, hahaha -- Covid19 abnormally high all! anything, that's *low*. fact, estimates high 50%, many miscarriages women never realized pregnant.

It's good raise awareness common miscarriage *always* is. unfortunate miscarriage frequently taboo subject. That's wrong!

Women couples experience painful loss know It’s placebo, actual medical doctors often send people chiropractors. 

The “science” chiropractic - truly bizarre holds kinds illnesses connected spine health - bullshit suspect many chiropractors don’t believe. 

But actual manipulation helpful many people certain back shoulder issues.

And true massage therapy, terms outsize claims sometimes made massage, well fact *are* benefits certain people get massage. Even “aligning reiki” whatever isn’t one them. actually don't, there's chronic issue go see physical therapist get treatment instead feel good subscription plan. Save ya breath homie... lost cause. evidence big bang evolution work without super being, without evidence super supposing one exists like supposing fairies exist, Hercules fuck  important looking push false narrative vaccine inefficacy

The reporting fine; facts facts. problem quoted text it’s taken completely context push false narrative vaccine inefficacy. Jesus Christ........This country mess  reason beds full vaccinating kids. Can't agree more. 

One day work someone started scribble back hand (we wear fin gloves) pen. instantly turned vegetable, defenseless, unable think cucumber without willpower.

This feels amazing. Hands best kind massage get Earth. probably don’t get mononucleal antibodies ivermectin though.  I'm gonna self isolate couple days testing. specifically asking would start spreading today (within 24h potentially contracting virus) people/family house wearing masks.

I person assume worst. Wow that’s bizarrely money. DeSantis like villain Scooby Doo : “I would gotten away too, weren’t meddling kids” wish best. know it’s hard worry. 

My FIL, late 80s recovering now. uncontrolled high BP, otherwise healthy. spend couple days hospital getting O2, home feeling fine. vaccine really help much! Look, want see single child die COVID. think people acknowledge missing school extended period time also damage children. long term developmental issues, especially among younger children. certain point matter picking poison. Fucking chiropractors. DOCTORS. Yeah agree. It’s already September haven’t seen data submitted approval yet know takes weeks data submission Right, correct point countries already produced traditional style vaccines, imagine reason developed countries primarily access much efficacious, easier manufactur vaccine available anything else. Priorizing production acquisition vaccines seems sensible approach. many people general public would prefer traditional vaccine, many places world tiny sliver population. Canada something like 80%+ eligible population willing take vaccine. province, nearing 85%. imagine even majority remaining 15% going swayed less efficacious vaccine. Maybe few, big holdouts much stubborn that.

In end, even without children yet eligible, value entire population utilizing highlight effective vaccine can't discounted. China, billions traditional vaccine, feeling pressure augment shiny new. 

The value proposition low. Time effort, convince percentage population take less effective vaccine. give generally least effected population, children, vaccine months sooner - could make good argument waiting mRNA vaccines available children going beneficial society long run guess China allies people expect north Korea accepting help west's something saying 0.1% COVID-19 cases outdoor transmission country? think Ireland. point “we” obviously using herd immunity strategy kids. way young kids going opportunity get vaccinated delta sweeps every one them. shit spreads like wildfire primary school like best possible environment. It’s literally already over, watch (or try get schools go back remote, isn’t gonna happen 95% country). end algorithm someone PAYING send message. So, yeah, Uncle Bruce facebook getting ads telling aliens curing 99.99% covid cases, there's entity willing pay make Uncle Bruce believe alien ivermectin. And, course, Zuckerberg willing take entity's money. Lamed, cough put covid pot...   Seems used long time, different things:  ""Unproven"" implies might proven help. proven harmful. Honestly, I'd happy grow hearing voices head. there's microchips 

I family member send wife message social media back January talking microchips vaccine. requirement like 7 8 vaccines one little tiny microchip, like nanochip. 

Once body, 5G signal causes assemble giant superchip.....like Voltron. post title Coronavirus sub name country / region thread about. one says ""USA"" orange. hope helps! Chiropractor’s smh.  parents little reluctant vaccinate children. Also, we’ve seen lately, vaccine doesn’t necessarily mean wont get spread covid. Everyone figured would flying cars future. Look us Exactly point. saying nothing automatically saying evidence either. Simply aligning oneself either side missing entire point. medical doctors work coroner, sometimes employees office, usually contract basis. coroner person charge agency. protect serious disease

Some that, far, seems depend call ""serious disease."" general, ""serious disease"" seems used mean admitted hospital, ""mild disease"" means didn't.

But people ""mild disease"" afib, cognitive deficits, number medium-term lifelong life-reducing problems. Call crazy, want shit. want risk long-term problems covid way ballpark risk long-term problems car wreck going work, even long-term problems particularly inconvenience strain medical system.  late teenager, would find funny. Murica recently read something maybe. Seems like anti bad push natural.immunity first got original COVID maybe got vaccine. vaccine first dead. Maybe politics. They’ve sealed fates refused vaccine depend though lot black brown donkeys died 2020 stuck dense zoos whereas elephants spread wildlife preserves. many black brown donkeys interact customers.  guy getting scolded wife newsworthy. bet man getting scolded wife would make good sitcom They're ones. doubt honestly believe chiropractic helped you. And, give benefit doubt, maybe did. 

However, injuries claim treat (and indeed minor injuries general) tend self resolving. words, whether go chiropractor, physio, doctor local witch doctor, chances whatever may resolved itself.

So hard know effect treatment effect body's natural healing mechanisms. 

In addition, sort ""medical"" treatment - including genuine, evidence based, scientifically backed treatment, well utter quackery - placebo effect. clinical setting, reassuring words practitioner, even simple things like wearing lab coat - things shown improve *perceived* outcomes patients.

So unfortunately, confounding factors, story like ""well, helped me"" tells us absolutely nothing whether useful warranted intervention. I'm saying help you, I'm saying ways might helped nothing chiropractor actually did. 

That rule chiropractor's interventions helpful. Maybe were. I'm trying highlight evidentiary issues here.  Surely expats China. failure follow instructions = 0 day hey ordered treatment Covid. partisan medical marijuana?  God damnit. wrote long comment sources explain guy bad argument goes deletes them. can't respond. feel unsatisfied. Half comments didn’t even read first sentence article know it’s one fucking guy giving third exemption forms. imagine many anti vaxx fear needle. come many excuses admit it. mean would prefer horse deworming meds vaccine!

So hope nasal administered convince lot fear needle. :[ I'm ICU nurse, taken care terrifying number patients similar injuries chiropractors. thought I'd get ahead inevitable Ivermectin apologists.

Darwin putting work… Australian politician started back New Year’s Eve according article. never referred chiropractor actual medical professional, actually treat anything. actual medical professional referred physical therapist, get actual medical training actually improve condition. 
  
The thing chiropractors covered med school treat injuries cause.    things consider: 

1.	Relative risk— delta, going able avoid forever. carries higher risk bad outcomes? Vaccination? COVID? 
2.	One way think risks: 2 BILLION people 5 BILLION doses administered worldwide different vaccines. many issues much less died? Nearly none. 220M COVID cases worldwide. 4.56 MILLION deaths. Probably 10-20x lasting effects organ damage. 
3.	96%+ doctors US vaccinated. 
4.	Almost politicians vaccinated. Even ones push anti-vax stuff. ones didn’t get vaccinated sick dead. 
5.	Almost everyone Provincetown outbreak vaccinated. perfect environment transmission get, lots crowded indoors events, masks. 7 hospitalized deaths among vaccinated 1,000 known cases 60,000+ attendees. nobody vaccinated, would seen least 10-20 deaths dozens hundreds hospital. 

In opinion, overwhelming evidence vaccines safe, work amazingly well preventing death hospitalization (and even infection, vaccines never designed prevent). 

Hope chat doctor helps too! night shift isn’t left nothing, get crusts one cold slice share lol chiropractors new ""pain clinic"" doctors Florida? Well, already yesterday. xD Patients waiting waiting room wearing masks, receptionists maskless hygienists walking around masks pulled down.

My hygienist wearing KN95 entire time. chatted bit, mentioned work pretty lucky since 90% us employees vaxxed handful caught COVID, said, “yeah, that’s us.” I’m thinking guess means everyone vaxxed? ):

But it’s late now, already got cleaning x-rays. gotta trust vaccine! Massage therapists delusions grandeur. Thats problem.

Medical doctors malpractice - wrong. entire field chiro malpractice. Hospitalizations also dropping pretty fast. think there’s fair chance it’s burned unvaxed population. Going concert weekend proof vaccination/negative request mandatory entry. hate bring actual vaccine card worry would misplace it. anyone success taking picture would suggest photo copying it?

I can't imagine angry years end. hate lotteries. 1 million tax payer dollars goes one person instead dunno persons local hospital pandemic. frustrating narrow self interest always rewarded dumb system. That’s true dont think bad personally. many people vaccinated now. kids start getting really ill different story entirely though. Send body bags…. also think incredibly smart. UK peaked July 21, start heading back Aug 3 without going much, maybe peak leveling 31k new cases per day 150-ish deaths per day 7-day average.

From UK data, clear Delta peak way past variants. Especially without additional mitigation. Spoiler:  Sorry, misunderstood. think everyone expects childhood vaccines covid exist near future. It'd different disease schedule. Thanks kind thoughts.

I know minutia using term doctor (without visibly displaying chiropractor part) context various state law.. I'm sure varies state state. 

For example, one Canadian provinces requires words chiropractic/chiropractor precede follow word Dr. 

Point is, totally allowed claim doctor (some version another) licensed. 

Anyway, ripe misleading people! Right? Back Surgeons love patients. They’ll always back. one making news earliest one US doctor amended death certificate list COVID-19 cause death. M.R. Greene running mate. match made Hell. largest chiropractic school US 100% acceptance rate. also original chiro school. Palmer college chiropractic - davenport. He's also good friends Trump. least initially, he's guy might held political reasons (and definitely run office football). That's kind scary someone left side effects strong fucks up. You’re still much, much less likely contract covid. so, much much less likely get sick. Vax + negative test enough travel. sure, likely prevent spread degree. referring particular study. True, planets would better. Imagine proxima b variant, alas MIGHT happen  mandates gain support among electorate, means out-crazy anyone wise might challenge them.

Look Texas - there's well-funded candidate trying primary Abbott right. I-35 billboards guy full racisrt/alt-right dogwistles (Stop giving illegals money! End Property taxes! End votor fraud! Close border! Etc). convinced Abbott going fast crazy town - he's desperate keep job. least qualified people medical field comes masks What’s next, won’t accept witch doctors? doctor needs lose license sheriff needs criminals charges filed him.

**The drug's manufacturer, Merck, said February found evidence ivermectin effective treatment patients COVID-19.**

The American Medical Association, American Pharmacists Association American Society Health-System Pharmacists Wednesday called immediate end prescribing using drug treat coronavirus outside clinical trials.

Washington County Sheriff Tim Helder, spokesperson office jail physician Dr. Rob Karas respond calls emails Wednesday. Karas last week released lengthy statement defending use ivermectin, saying prescribing drug inmates patients clinics since late last year.

Edrick Floreal-Wooten, inmate, said given ivermectin jail tested positive Aug. 21.

""I asked they, they'd tell vitamins,"" Floreal-Wooten said. ""With sick us sick, thought help us. never thought would something shady.""

Floreal-Wooten said refused take drug last week seeing news article ivermectin prescribed inmates.

Asked whether would taken drug told outset ivermectin, responded: ""Never. I'm livestock. I'm human.""

The ACLU said also heard several inmates say told drug vitamins steroids.  FDA gave EUA monoclonal antibody treatments children aged 12+. trials ongoing younger children. went podiatry school, similar medical school, significant emphasis disease treatment foot ankle, less training systemic disease. surgeons well, limited foot ankle. get hate though, I'd happy see one medical problem limited foot hesitate let one operate foot (assuming good references). Yes. Every virus sacred. problem is, may feel good, fixing anything. back going still problem medical condition. could even making things worse long run. That's main issue.

If Chiropractic worked, would recommended medical professionals valid treatment, not. isn't. even remotely medical professionals. even that! everything power make act giving birth hard painful (and expensive) mothers legally can.

Do one guys know?  inherent flaw logic.

Specifically kids.  They're getting wanted. wanna wear masks, wear masks. wanna socially distance, didn't. want vaccine, get either. they're always going meeting Jesus- they're getting everything they've ever wanted! feel bad for? may use it.

Why would opposite? think at, time quit. pulled numbers chart get 14-day average 166.

PTSD all. nurses get to? young. Idk trying get at. point they're higher risk me.    Well, might enjoy reddit then.  first time heard last year. found article CDC website seems gloss fact people give consent. 

[CDC Tuskegee  really worth noting also presence antibodies imply immunity. know one dose vaccine really stop catching covid (though would probably stop serious illness), stimulate antibody production.

My husband study generates statistic, first time tested positive antibodies, two weeks first dose Pfizer. ONE week first dose AZ, probably little protection infection, still showed antibody test.

The percentage population positive antibodies measure percentage *some* measure immunity (ranging full sterilizing immunity little bit protection), measure many people longer able catch virus.  follows mild course think like flu- you’ll probably feel like crap fever week. Monitor yourself, feel like it’s hard breath, call ambulance. Sorry got school, friend know precautions taken. that, 0.01% quoted article appears CFR, IFR, likely much lower (0.002% age 10,  Cases New York.   Ivermectin prescribed doctor reasonable doses harmless. ^ Unchecked stupidity. recall driver's ed teenager, said teens would drive dangerously thought invincible.

The concept applies antivax, full-grown adults families.  One thing wondered seeing statistic look mortality, pretty notable half million kids tested positive (one imagine multiple possible asymptomatic).

I three kids myself, two eligible vaccinated. 

When went searching data sure I'd see marked increase mortality. According appears timespan May, June, July August total 83 children aged 0-17 died Covid almost 10,000 causes. 83 deaths fewer number children died pneumonia timeframe.

It goes without saying children deaths bad.

I know others follow lot closely - data accurate?      wonder many first dose shots actually unauthorized boosters Looking like end year went chiropractor massage therapy covered insurance. always offered adjustments said ""no thanks."" fail see passports make 'even reluctant'. Sure, they'll stomp feet b\*tch moan, ultimately everyone wants participate public life they'll get it. That's rough. 

My 6 year old quarantine 10 days 3 days kindergarten kid class Friday tested positive Sunday. mask required positives yet. test daughter Sunday safe. Well, definitely medications work well haha...like antibiotics. something say ICU one third patients survive matter do, one third patients die matter do, last one third could tip one way another. Obviously based statistics anything experience pretty accurate. mention anything affordability medical conditions? 

You’re literally trying craft side argument me. Open mind up. isn’t worth arguing you.  

The biological ties alone plenty justification biological child. Thats valuable child well continue ignore.  

Just ridiculous argument around though. appreciate enjoy adoption route isn’t everyone. doesn’t make somebody selfish. Cheers. Fair point. I’d surprised people even knew intestines *are*. Ok, look way. CDC, people large amount people field decades suggested it. Equivalent countries done same. 

Do really feel amount googling match experience knowledge field?

Consider that. me, that's need. people know they're talking about. say otherwise? Counter: Today saw double number vaccine first doses Ontario.  passport announced yesterday.  What's point 'waiting get vaccinated family'? Thanks guys create space polluted misinformation. sub go-to staying up-to-date. Good in-vitro lab results. Certainly worth exploring trials. much came trials. credit Ivermectin looked promising HQC  Optional. daughter masked. know likely damn fault. Oh yeah, framing certainly help people work hourly wages time off. exactly them?

Do kids?

I mean, pulled child preschool last year kept home year wife white collar workers ability hire nanny fulltime 40 hours week. nanny making parents. 

You're living made world think parents kids home still work. knew self-proclaimed aesthetician designed store-front displays. claimed made ""six figures"", though I'm sure means digits currency, whether counting past decimal point, meant got keep 6 mannequins. Apparently definition ""a person knowledgeable nature appreciation beauty, especially art."" imagine day children lost mother father sometimes both, realize grow orphans parents stubbornly refused vaccinated? Lol ridiculous That’s one example. Retail service industry struggling keep people pay much used to. Nurses making 100+ hour top normal wages don’t walk anyway. industries hard time finding people many folks left workforce various reasons. guess parents also cancel health insurance never go doctor too.

Because obviously know better.  . . 85 percent **eligible population** needs vaccinated avoid lockdown fall due highly contagious delta variant.

- Get sick said medicine

- Overwhelms already strained health system 

I wish one day create cure morons.  English translation may true, getting neck back cracked felt sooooo good.  Weirdly chiropractic scam even bigger countries Yeah we've first big community outbreak since March 2020. Cases predominantly Auckland (our biggest city) we've strict lockdown 3 weeks now. Peak 83 cases today we've 28 community cases.

The public get reason lockdown, we'd rather right multiple failed lockdowns control spread whilst low vaccination rates. know looks like want here.

Our govt daily 1pm update senior govt (either PM senior minister) either Director General Health Director public health. communication awesome open. probably watch one like 👍 

We've got this.

WTF. whole industry looks bad. study actually interesting commentary social distancing. 

The intervention groups small increase people observing distancing protocol control groups - something like 29% 25% respectively. (They much larger increase mask adherence; something around 41% intervention group 11% control group.) 

Some interesting tidbits? study overwhelmingly counted men women looking masking distancing, men much likely go public places (I.e, mosques). Distancing mosques rarely observed, better places like markets. 

Not direct answer “does distancing help”, get hands pre-print PDF would, it’s fascinating read.  that’s fucked still feels comfortable tho, like fuck used intern mental health non-profit runs juvenile hall-based mental health program. would groups individual counseling inside detention pod (all kids particular pod enrolled program—a kind “privilege” second chance help at-risk youth cusp adulthood indiscretions could land adult prison).

52.7% (total population fully vaccinated) + 40% 47.3% =~ 72%

Why putting bullshit, America? None excused behavior. That’s *BIG* word.

They don’t like it. get shots. I've stayed away dentist office since January 2020.

Maybe bad., next cleaning worse keep waiting. article kind push go get done.  Thanks posting it. Podiatrists definition DPM degrees US. orthopedic foot/ankle specialists MDs/DOs, different things. &lt;3 Endemic means virus common ailment people get regularly. Majority population immunity severe disease due previous exposure.

We get one two ways, get - either wild exposure, vaccine.

Vaccine route preferred obviously much much faster. Wild exposure hand might take better part decade everyone get sick.

Once everyone exposed, newborns immunity mothers. consensus seems growing everyone get virus. 

I've basically come conclusion. matter vaxxed maybe really sick, vaxxed dead. know would call 64% ""very high vaccination rate"". Roentgen, great, terrible. 

Cracked one! Great show went 7 years without seeing dentist. Flossing Listerine job. Dentist surprised well teeth were. single cavity Aaah! Taliban another great idea! 'Venice"". nothing jerks.

No. book,

There ""book"" says chiro's quacks.

The good ones highly skilled ""massage therapists"" IMO. musculoskeletal adjustment helpful good body (See Osteopathy Doctors example).

Most formalized Osteopathic training, especially bodies certify doctors, done away classical quackery associated United States training osteopathic physicians similar Doctor Medicine (MD) physicians.[10][11] Osteopathic manipulation still included curricula osteopathic physicians considered unique aspect Doctor Osteopathic Medicine (DO) training. United States, graduates osteopathic medical schools option sit osteopathic physician-specific COMLEX medical licensing exam allopathic USMLE licensing exam.

Just reference.

So... musculoskeletal manipulation still accepted valid medical treatments.

But unfortunately, Chiropractics hung quackery too.

Unfortunately, lot ""naturopathic"" afficionados go chiro reason. really understand all. Veteranarians medical doctors. DVM, MD I'm sorry. unimaginable, yet are. Trust me, nurses would love to. even nursing student myself, it’s hard walk away, even they’re unvaxxed, nasty, etc.

Plus abandonment licensing issues… crisis hand. Frontline workers, healthcare workers, education workers going significant trauma this. unfortunately, doubt assistance funding them. Plus we’re already short-staffed across nation… future isn’t looking great skip medically professionals though. went chiropractor. makes sense since chiropractors doctors like Doctor J doctor.   church magnets. head. ban unvaxxed, don’t punish rest us worked would called ""medicine"" think.

Like get wet sweat still work? go in-person school, school plays indoor sport kids go school. chiropractic pseudoscience. quackery, nothing else. ""Adjustments"" BS. minimal scientific evidence actually effective, significant evidence harmful. good lobbyists get covered insurance make seem like medical professionals. Exercise, go physical therapist, yoga, get massage back pain (after seeing doctor ensure something dangerous), never go chiropractor. Dear GOD. Can't sell give Florida country build wall along Florida border   There’s running list bars restaurants city require proof vaccination. happily gave one money weekend, enforcing requirement.

(It casual French restaurant, well spaced tables, staff masked, food fantastic.) mom dialysis nurse Florida, ended getting shingles added stress Covid. I'm little confused, really, negativity opinions reflect experiences. I'm sold anyone's schtick probably helps navigate avoid quacks, maybe?

One example muscle cramps. chiropractor told 27-ish years ago muscle fibers need magnesium function correctly I'm painful leg cramps may want sure deficient common one. Last year major abdominal surgery anesthesia wore biggest discomfort back cramping like crazy. idea expect that, simply begged heating pad (which another trick learned ages ago use time neck.) doc approved - back - next morning told going add normal routine. Nice. already know that?? Haha. Damn, weekly, he's old celebrated peer community. (He also bothered test iron dangerously low prior surgery.) meantime nurse practitioner floor heard comment draw labs - ordered potassium/magnesium infusion low potential cause back cramps.

I lot stories like this.This extremism confuses me.  believe plural form Floridas Man/Woman. I'm certified word scientist, though, take word it. great part Ministry Health's virology modellers quite accurate predicting total number cases rise fall new cases time (provided people followed Alert Level 4 lockdown - pretty much everybody except nutbags).  Projection…it’s always projection. Hawaii doesn’t vaccination rate much higher rest US. Also aren’t seeing insane amount cases. It’s kept number daily cases pretty low recently. Long Covid isn’t common think is. it’s even less common vaccinated. false hope, help us indeed. need see help us short time take little longer make effect virus.  paid 100 bucks popular. They're fake doctors anyway One thing gave hope potential nasal administered vaccines. Maybe misunderstood, understood nasal vaccines could dramatically lower viral shedding nasal passage causes transmission. gave hope way getting this, false hope? mother has. stand said. Oh I'm sorry, show ONE severed head I'm asshole?!?

This stupid world.  chiropractors scamming fools made decent change I'm guessing. Hawaii well vaccinated. It’s like 55% total population fully vaccinated, average country. Sad irony headline. Something tells locked house wouldn’t issue. Probably different room different activities every hour day CEO position underlying theory practice studied.  


I take fact every chiro nutter. venn diagram pretty damn close circle I'm looking someone quack help, I'd look job titles like physio, massage therapist, ortho... Please. 

If misinformation, tell major US medical college provides chiropractic education. They're already selling snake oil, huge leap actively destroying people's health instead improving it. US that’s probably what’s going happen. It’s become politicized means likely struggle getting people vaccinated enforcing restrictions for…a long time. Please educate yourself. Please stop spreading misinformation.

It’s poor kids. see rich kids getting covid eat processed junk live front screens time. disagree, immediately distrusted chiro proved otherwise. saying change title. simply explaining might not.

Evidently people are! study shows ivermectin similar drugs may antiviral potential, even though levels study cytotoxic still important study things like this. research research done determine lower doses combined therapies might sufficient antiviral potential. That's one avenue could expand research anti-parasitics viral infections makes complete sense, come blue.  It’s recorded original card. got asked first second shot. said would third. said ok. questions asked right world Sending love hugs xoxo Ok situation getting complicated.

That's great way putting it. like original efficacy 95% immediately assumed equal 100% many people (""do whatever want!""). like 80% people scream WTF EVEN WORK! lot confusion there. there's worry cases way -- delta 2x infectious original Covid, mitigation used work holding back infections advice reliable/not alarmist sources news info?

It's hard say, usual good journalistic sources usually good general (NY Times, etc.). Though lot information goes date quickly. anything news portions sites (Science magazine Nature, top 2 science journals world), evidence based get.

BTW one peer reviewed journal articles showing Pfizer Astrazeneca vaccine effectiveness delta variant, using data UK, here: Omg truth!  Sending love hugs xoxoo Fuck em! willfully took shit, treat folks would rather shot day! let natural selection run it’s course dispose idiots? Nobody said either or, idiot. vaccine works. Ivermectin works. People vaccine still getting sick, Ivermectin valid treatment. Hahaaa, I'm Canada funnily enough couple friends half jokingly asked thing Trump got elected stuff started happening    guess Mu Thing... cherry picked first link, ignored subsequent four clinical trials. Great job. scientific. Chiropractors medical professionals. debating this. They’re EXACT thing Naturopaths, pseudoscience bullshit apparently effective.  peer reviewed medical research says prevents COVID. hate science want, end science win out. Ivermectin almost effective single dose vaccine.

I'll take thing that's works renown peer reviewed *more* effective, *almost* effective single dose, let alone 2.

I hate science, love peer review expert consensus. also like things science confirms better. employer kicked everyone ICU.  Maybe shove dewormers hall let 'em suffer. anyone explain people taking horse meds Covid? let ivermectin folks go home pray drink bleach? Relax, downvote you. Im trying come American headline can't   self medicate. Depends talking protection infection protection severe disease. former may terribly long-lived latter probably be. Fitting fake username then, ay? long Disney gets nothing else done help. certainly flawed, would perfectly logical conclusion anyway? missing forest trees here? I'm sitting South outside larger cities find mask distancing practices whatsoever. one still believes go hand hand pro/anti vax behavior know say. Well mother American... throw dumb asses Absolutely nailed it. land “prayer Warriors” “faith fear.” loved ones die horrible preventable deaths talk passed peacefully got Angel wings attached gofundme. It’s fucking creepy. It’s incredible. won’t listen CDC, excuse “FDA didn’t approve vax.” FDA = beacon scientific truth, CDC = Fauci gubment 5G.

Until they’re arguing abolishing regulating bodies bs Facebook group say FDA shouldn’t exist.

Trying understand logic gives headache. can’t imagine it’s like living interacting world level cognitive dissonance. Pro tip: ever get shot, pop horse paste jump hospital queue! one COVID19 trick doctors want know! Thing not. year everyone's trying call game we've even finished first quarter.  guy Russian troll farm came shit get bonus, shit happens?

""Congrats, Pavel! Stupid Americans taking horse drugs instead getting vaccine. get extra 7 litres vodka bonus week."" understand saying, research weak. ok research ""OMG COVID VACCINES DEVILS WORK LET US TAKE IVERMECTIN"" approach used. approach sane, people asking think cure covid ""we need research"" Teachers need booster shots. End problem. Sound like classic ""shoot patient virus dies too"" gambit. problem is, even do, who's going enforce it? Local law enforcement? They're side people want get vaccinated wear masks.   Oh god, completely forgotten Sure, unvaccinated people comparatively dropping like flies, one old guy vaccinated died, clearly vaccine useless!

Or favorite that's spreading like wildfire:

But vaccine stop spread! pointless! (Leaving important part lowers risk serious illness death also likely contagious shorter period time.) think parroted Dr Mengela quote. Also need multiple times deadly dosis humans. unless die took little anyway. throw handful, wait hours still live throw another. Repeat possible anymore instruct family throw amount * x death. Totally trivial determine correct doses kill covid. Kill * x

(not sure exactly x was, research yourself) literally ZERO reason resume ""Normal"" person activities except greed stupidity. 

Controlling delta manageable degree possible. requires higher vaccination, vaccine passports, cases mask mandates well. countries dealing school?   Toxins leaving body!! 🙏 Bless Lol best comment ever  feat brain logic?

I think got brain boost bc Reddit cakeday today. Well, ivermectin know what's it. Ivermectin. awful side effects, that's besides point. sub that?  Excellent point. 

4000 years Jews nodded heads say, ""yes, yes, good point. But..."" immediately prepared counterarguments. that's do.  Except dentist whose sad eyes clearly communicate judges flossing. randomized clinical trial included 476 patients, duration symptoms significantly different patients received 5-day course ivermectin compared placebo (median time resolution symptoms, 10 vs 12 days; hazard ratio resolution symptoms, 1.07). 

This actual randomized clinical trial published reputable medical journal. expect see coming months confirming BS Idiots Walking Around far nothing seems outcompeting delta though, delta discovered December 2020. Wait... what?? How... feat brain logic? sure trying trick oppress away human rights? wonder buy stock in, anticipation next antivax fixation...   America wunderbar get pretty effective vaccine minor side effects except rare cases protective action, try cure unapproved drug uncontrolled doses make blind shit myself. Hmm, tough choice. Okay, go next gen example starting 1500 children 580 elderly 

You get 2250 children 1190 elderly

Then 3375 2069

Then 5062 3342 

You able predict number infected elderly knowing population young infected people population young infected people changed. Simply, there's variables model. ""Live free die"" That's stand straight. Oh sorry, didn’t realize September 20. funny thing tried, destroy them, give links articles, like [this dude pointing ultimate proof paste worked, took 10 seconds see article big hypothesis, kept reading found assumptions, ideas, author article says conclusion, pending computational simulations chemical-physical laboratory analysis, hypothesis could applied known pharmacological molecules, order identify compounds probable ionophore nature used research clinical practice.

When pointed dude, changed subject like, ""you want do, want ok?"" course let go, kept asking evidence dewormer works, get anything

And btw, dude pointed article, read it, impressed this

EDIT: Typos Heartbreaking! father-in-law died exact way....in May 2020, right start. taught us everything needed know hell hearing story story conclusion. I'm sorry affected. many gunshot victims waiting bed almost like it’s clickbaity Sort drunk looking keys streetlight argument Yep. get sick stomach watching children school board meetings witnessing parents make complete fools themselves. can’t help wonder types entitled little monsters children’s generation deal with. Yikes.  Yeah, triage doesn’t care injury though, life threatening is. 

Now also believe end ER shitting guts horse paste self applied, kid scraped knee get first. agree, think issue contradicts CDC recommending. easy understand people getting frustrated ""the science"" sometimes contradicts, especially dealing new virus new vaccines figuring acceptable risk levels. 

At least people likely frustrated good reason. group world's top scientists disagreeing another group world's top scientists. respect frustration ""this goes nobody said social network!"" “We prepared offer booster shots Americans beginning week September 20 starting 8 months individual’s second dose. time, individuals fully vaccinated earliest vaccination rollout, including many health care providers, nursing home residents, seniors, likely eligible booster.”

On CDC website. CDC also stated you’re immune compromised go ahead get earliest convenience. we?  anti vaxxers would see proof fda get widely reported elsewhere; entirely consistent discussion Monday's ACIP meeting.

Looks like:

 - currently looks like sufficient data effectiveness fade justify boosters recipients Pfizer 

 - initial booster campaign likely higher risk groups (nursing home residents, health care workers, people 65)

 - may recommendations recipients vaccines October. Yes, we're constantly discharging people too. figures ""not great, terrible"" moment; represents slight jump, hopefully blip rather trend. Gold metal mental gymnast. want let medical treatment become predicated 'who dislike'. works properly real problem people now, mean can't weaponized future (this person got STD homo sex, treat them, etc). listen know age-old saying ""5 shots stay alive""....  think joke anymore. Regardless current stuff gets resolved two groups cant agree something basic like standards scientific proof sources information trust going start getting along. 

And thing people getting tired trying find common ground. elected officials becoming extreme stubborn views. desperate take whatever action 'fix' things whether legal precedent not.

Whatever next crisis face going exacerbate issue. isnt going end well without kind massive unforeseen intervention brings us together. Thats fucked Completely agree. prioritizing? certain point think, cold is, hospitals full allowed kick people shit people injuries caused stupidity waiting. People got shot, heart attack, anything like right treated, people anti vax shit deserve same. aren’t making vulnerable weakening bodies immune systems? get COVID body already struggling ivermectin overdose, may hard time fighting COVID too. always thought headlines game Plague Inc. hilariously unrealistic (e.g. thousands infected national kissing festival). Turns brutally accurate. sad, I'm sure believe it. 

Because would appear stark corelation ""NPR people"" getting brain damage vs. ""Fox News people"" getting it.

Unless, course...you're making joke. case? r/whoosh give ketamine release woods child needs person learning succeed.

To fair, nearly children do, meaning responsibility bigger individual. like dress codes, existing vaccine requirements, basic hygiene rules, adults running schools need enact CDC recommended mandates protect students. Whoever came shit genius. way wipe thousands idiots couple words. push anti freeze next? Please?  feel like meat flavoring would probably discourage them. hope.   Well no, can’t actually shut down. open lawsuits though. first amendment allows lie, say whatever want, government cannot stop it.

That’s general broad strokes. course it’s exactly true ISIS isn’t allowed distribute materials cigarette ads allowed. lmao people literally blinding horse paste lieu getting vaccinated

jesus fucking christ   He's also using 'all information equal' fallacy, whatever called. Health advice Faux News random conservative radio host nearly valuable health advice from... actual doctors. want take anti parasite therapeutic say going overseas ask doctor write proscription. Don’t think low dosage medicine help fight covid drug generally safe well tolerated FDA approved dosage. doctor reading Internet drug database  suspect selection bias pool subjects. percentage pool vaccinated match general public vaccination percentage, data could over-represent antibody presence. 

I suspect likely donate blood good others' health likely get vaccinated community good.  Like determining many kids allowed leave country?

Because ""greater good"" arguments right tyrannical maniacal playbooks.     There's always delay. Two weeks dude. spent one year Oklahoma noped fuck back California. couldn’t believe bad was. Fire them. get exposed pathogen right getting second shot asymptomatic likely boost immunity. getting reexposed though booster shots help keep immunity high.   can't let decided stupid shit die people victims others first? Last checked one held gunpoint told take ivermectin.      Restricting access geographical location / service mandating someone injected something.

Let's stretch imagination imagine world state could tell cannot child, reason greater good. Would swing book? 

Because ethical reason mandatory vaccines greater good. can't reason take someone's right choice away.    fairness, 7k+ yesterday dumped backlog. We're still far high need though. government trying get people tagged gps chips via fake vaccine, kind headline I'd make people think anti-vaxxer stupid, get vaccinated obviously stupid.

Edit: safe, vaccinated, believe conspiracy, also canadian. Eh, read article prisoners Arkansas given Ivermectin without knowledge. essentially treated prisoners guinea pigs see drug would work.   talk aerosolizing vaccine spraying public place. Maybe walmart?  thought clear stating nothing wrong immigrants working care home. I’m one lefties would like immigrants world, make America diverse interesting. 

And nothing positive experiences people cared parents, LOVED parents. dad’s caregiver cried died. would braid mom’s hair. 

All trying point old woman Kansas first die Covid, family mentions never left home, except staying nursing home died, that’s possible explanation staff international. It’s fact life globalized world would never think another human dirty immigrant. 

My maternal grandparents immigrants Sicily time Sicilians lynched marginalized US, considered less human eugenics movement. see immigrants color, creed ethnicity different see grandparents.  think study showing ivermectin good dealing COVID in-vitro Follow Ivermectin winning Nobel prize great medication/discovery people think great COVID. problem really boils people recognizing behaves vitro it'll behave human body people recognizing dosage extremely important. High doses Tylenol Benadryl vastly different therapeutic dosage. Article mention contracted school school even started... light details. know?  Haha knew kidding. bottom article, links two studies use ivermectin COVID-19 treatment, one NIH, one University Oxford. numbers ivermectin administered human patients current time Covid vaccines, several billion dose range.

Thank voice truth among Reddit NPCs nothing contribute echo chamber. countries sometimes take difficult choices greater good. wonder Delta finally runs hosts there. UK already 2+ million confirmed cases since current wave, probably many undetected. Considering vaccination immunity previous waves, close endgame now, right?  i've always wondered... pliers blow torch?  NJ still #1 death

Fair point. way suggesting people take miracle drug.

I’m saying conversation devolved “miracle cure” vs “horse-paste.”

The truth needs studied shouldn’t ruled has. exactly point better immunity catch first? Surely point better immunity decrease likelihood catching it. see anybody adverse vaccines would opt catch get better immunity rather opting boost immunity catching it. insufferable talk people think way. always act though ""owned you."" reality, everyone thinks dumb. American headline ever seen. politicized intelligence, matter stupid liberal body autonomy important, maybe? kids still wearing masks school Scotland? use lateral flow testing wish here. hospitals prob let Darwin’s theory play Ivermectin group point.

I know ask :) marvelous evening. Wait...but line gunshot victims Oklahoma?? ways preventing it. Florida, wisdom elected leaders, choosing take every measure make sure maximum number people die quickly possible. 

I’m going say teachers strike, parents keep kids home, people streets, whatever proper response Florida’s psychopathic government be. I’m sure us states supposed consensus decision seems like it’s “thoughts prayers.”

At point, expect bunch people die Florida nothing, delta burns down, new variant comes Florida nothing again. throw compost rest intelligentsia Yet journalists keep covering give attention crave. also add many studies ivermectin use covid, one mention. studies substandard, performed doctors trying best countries vaccine yet easily available. high quality, yet finished. NIH ongoing study. Especially since Heartguard meat flavored chewable article says rural Oklahoma. Which, totally see happening.

First doses hardly flying shelves, still climbing up. Overall doses per day double lowest July. easy think everyone vaccinated yet huge antivaxxer never convinced, appear case - lazy people, hesitant people, people waited full FDA approval.. Efforts getting vaccine groups would effective way out. course vaccinating kids compete goal done too, pandemic balance mostly adults. Probably ""eliminated"", even one country could vaccinate 90%, countries may not, still international travel, etc. example still isolated cases measles US. case polio US 1993 thought brought international travel. Measles polio high vaccination rates US.

But virus would become ""endemic"" like would present isolated outbreaks rather huge waves sweeping country see now.

The reason 70%-90% thrown around vaccination reach level virus cannot really spread, i.e. ""herd immunity"". 90% US vaccinated think we'd almost completely stop hearing cases everything like today. ""But 1 case!"" dummies.

Well, lo behold next day fully vaccinated hostess tested positive (symptomatic since last Friday - people still coming work sick??) restaurant (albeit masked) whole time there. health anxiety hell, I'm also finding incredibly depressing - clearly can't take risks like eating indoors moment I'll exposed covid. seems like there's end game delta I'm dark place right now. Chiropractors also licensed state department health. talking board certification licensure?  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Background: Mask usage remains low across many parts world COVID19 pandemic, strategies increase mask-wearing remain untested. objectives were 
to identify strategies persistently increase mask-wearing assess impact of 
increasing mask-wearing symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. 


Methods: conducted cluster-randomized trial community-level mask promotion in 
rural Bangladesh November 2020 April 2021 (N=600 villages, N=342,126 adults). 
We cross-randomized mask promotion strategies village household level, including 
cloth vs. surgical masks. intervention arms received free masks, information importance masking, role modeling community leaders, in-person reminders 8 weeks. 
The control group receive interventions. Neither participants field staff were 
blinded intervention assignment. Outcomes included symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence (primary) prevalence proper mask-wearing, physical distancing, symptoms 
consistent COVID-19 (secondary). Mask-wearing physical distancing assessed 
through direct observation least weekly mosques, markets, main entrance roads to 
villages, tea stalls. 5 9 weeks follow-up, surveyed reachable participants 
about COVID-related symptoms. Blood samples collected 10-12 weeks follow-up for 
symptomatic individuals analyzed SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. 


Results: 178,288 individuals intervention group 163,838 individuals 
in control group. intervention increased proper mask-wearing 13.3% control 
villages (N=806,547 observations) 42.3% treatment villages (N=797,715 observations) 
(adjusted percentage point difference = 0.29 \[0.27, 0.31\]). tripling mask usage sustained intervention period two weeks after. Physical distancing increased from 
24.1% control villages 29.2% treatment villages (adjusted percentage point difference 
= 0.05 \[0.04, 0.06\]). 5 months, impact intervention faded, mask-wearing 
remained 10 percentage points higher intervention group. 
The proportion individuals COVID-like symptoms 7.62% (N=13,273) the 
intervention arm 8.62% (N=13,893) control arm. Blood samples collected 
from N=10,952 consenting, symptomatic individuals. Adjusting baseline covariates, the 
2 
intervention reduced symptomatic seroprevalence 9.3% (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) = 
0.91 \[0.82, 1.00\]; control prevalence 0.76%; treatment prevalence 0.68%). villages randomized surgical masks (n = 200), relative reduction 11.2% overall (aPR = 0.89 \[0.78, 
1.00\]) 34.7% among individuals 60+ (aPR = 0.65 \[0.46, 0.85\]). adverse events were 
reported. 


Conclusions: intervention demonstrates scalable effective method promote mask 
adoption reduce symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections topic add statement, Tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis bacterium produce toxins bodies particular toxins make humans sick, vaccine gives immunity toxins bacteria itself. class vaccine called toxoid. matter. fact 22.4% roughly 1:1 terms child COVID cases child population %. Meaning kids getting infected exact rate adults point. No. We're licensed state government legislature. I'd hope so, 6% seems impossible even Alabama vaccinated protected. people do. Even get breakthrough case unlikely, likely result mild illness. Delta contagious lead severe illness. Bottom line vaccinated fine. site linked e-commerce website allowed posts comments.

Edit: said knew one vaccinated person (the one referenced article) remember another one. one referenced article recovered went back assisted living facility. one still last time was. vaccinated, transplant patient therefore immunocompromised. Research shows vaccine population drastically less effective. cases, illnesses, lockdowns, restrictions, etc. unvaccinated. point opportunity get vaccinated aren't. They're affecting everyone, health risk ""live life"" risk. ironic take vaccine name freedom taking away freedoms people. selfish.  also use catastrophizing language scare patients paying long term visits waste PIP. zero evidence manual interventions change spinal joint orientation anatomy whatsoever. PTs educated extensively, chiropractors actively market opportunity. Absolutely shocking anyone believes people. old enough get vaccinated bring able vaccinated completely different. 18 (and depending situation significantly afterwards), nearly impossible defy parents. parents want it, they'll need conspirators prayer side effects get without severe repercussions.

Me think likely single point cross over, multiple ones. [Children ages 5 11 could eligible vaccine September, Avula also actually developed using aborted fetal cells. Anyone believe conspiracy theory bring non-circumstantial assume little protection infection (asymptomatic symptomatic) - well 50% - decent protection severe disease. earth would cancel? You’re protected now. really think you’ll mindset rest life covid isn’t going anywhere. you’re afraid getting covid passing onto someone vulnerable, cares they’re probably vaccinated. evasive answers say don't.

You idea going about. NONE.  One days Rockstar going come say GTA VI can't happen impossible write satire anymore. entirely wrong though. 

If average infected person becomes healthier via infections rising quickly healthier populations unhealthy populations, CFR drop. 

Vaccinated elderly people still experiencing higher CFR children.  
If double cases unvaccinated children, increase cases elderly 20%, expect increase deaths similar +20% rather +100% 

School opening increase deaths, multiplier cases experiences, since increase cases shift average case towards healthier person. No. thanks, already IBS. helped fight COVID Petri dish levels toxic humans

Guns also kill virus Petri dish lack empathy either way appalling.

Right? part that's bothering too. *weeks* Edit: saving millions increasingly productive dramatically Got Pfizer booster CVS today.

No need lie explain I'm high risk list specific CDC conditions qualify... made appointment morning, indicated needed Pfizer 3rd dose making it, that.

I *am* high risk, work hospital, I'm +8 months getting vaccinated back December/January, see point waiting another 3-4 weeks apparent reason.  website gave phone cancer recent surge Repub crazy policies popular late.

The last gasps dying political party... oh, wait, that's constituents covid. reaching now, back covid peak UK leader.

It vaccinated amount people fast possible. large country could compare, rest Europe recently catching up. legacy lives on!

Maybe volunteer time practice mitigation efforts get vaccinated, can. 

🎵*Good ‘ol Rocky Top…*🎵 Oklahoma hurt confusion Thank posting info. Singapore. like know going rest world re:covid. currently used anti parasitic mean can't uses interactions body found yet. 

That said, sufficient evidence must found using anything else already used for. Do. You. Have. Kids?

If so, please share wisdom, clearly rest us mortal shlubs need it. lot them. UK anywhere close top list.  Ah yes, show everyone else could ""volunteer"" get covid better rest us live America kids dying Covid. medical professionals united across board recommending anyone 12 older vaccinated. 

My son 15 disabled high risk bet vaccinated second able to. think country making solid decision, good guess. sure hope live regret it. curiosity, parent? I'm going assume no.  caught covid, let’s go Arby’s! People say trust read internet, 
yet there's comment fighting chiropractics so....   yet willing get safe effective vaccine. Right? best friend’s dad worked big Agri Pharm company boxes garage kid. sisters horses used couple times. Friend’s parents conservative worried happy visited wearing masks vaccinated. Lovely people long don’t talk politics. fucking resident chimpanzee Joe ""I hosted Fear Factor"" Rogan casually mentioning treatment. non-american feel genuinely bad innocent people country abandoned poor education social programs. Michigan. edit comment then. Oral versus topical MASSIVE difference. Many topical treatments dangerous taken orally.  Good job Joe Rogan Same, first shot described second second fucking succccked. looking forward third I’m classroom setting health care I’ll getting 6 months October Vaxed ppl aren’t dying. Plus aren’t Facebook slinging terrible memes ivermectin. It’s easy sad terrible people die stupidity. can’t nice things.

I fully expect deal Canada. Joe motherfucking Rogan. Trump also said something bleach hydroxychloroquine damn . knew words impact outcome depends entirely corporations decided steer country. literally defined socioeconomics better part last century gathering control. see recover this. agree 10000000%. supporting use ivermectin Covid. showing researching medical scientific studies topic easily lead one believe successful treatment. reality one must look overwhelming medical consensus drug studies mostly flawed much danger benefit using ivermectin Covid prevention/treatment. Still users medication idiots getting data social media. sucks question validity someones ivermectin claims hand well written study must debunk. people taking taking higher doses, they're taking animal formulations goodness knows fillers.

If people getting Ivermectin local feed store, think reasonable media call ""horse dewormer"". think states still contact tracing. We’ve done best protect them. encouraged wear masks, stay away large groups, receive vaccination boost antibodies - free mind you

All ever wanted protect suffering

And instead started slurping diarrhea inducing horse paste…

We tried, really did. point though, fuck’em  CDC late party every single recommendation advisory well 18 months now. research seems pretty damn clear efficacy drops even exact percentage seems vary wildly, probably we’re Borg fact unique. city 14% hospital fully vaccinated. That’s atrocious unnecessary something could done it. It’s going get better, whole endemic game isn’t happening year next there’s real possibility could get worse. I’m goddamn tired political bullshit. CDC wants everyone wait everyone world opportunity vaccinated feels like they’re willing risk lives make happen. competent group medical professionals disagree opinion?

In case, I'm also glad live easier avoid Facebook. Fox News plays 24 hour fear hate every time visit conservative relatives...  Hahahahaha. brings tear eyes. That’s thing: vaxed ppl dying major comorbidities. That’s unfortunate 😔 quite transmissible. point? Disease severity matters, easy get. whole world caught disease single day, nobody got sick problem.

Covid never disappear even stopped transmission many animal reservoirs virus keep mutating forever. key force virus become endemic disease generally mild. evolutionary pressure virus become deadly. need tell plan end game say need keep extreme measures place mutations effectively saying kids never go school take in-person social activities forever. never get better vaccination. end game. everyone chance get vaccine best get (likely boosters, course). look original comment say wished kids choices could approved vaccines. However, change fact risk Covid children generally very, small. Monkey see monkey NB consider many 400 would gotten smaller viral load, maybe infected all, population vaccinated. vaccinated people wouldn’t died people took vaccine.

I don’t know model that, isn’t easy taking ratio. percentage 20%-25% hospital beds, ER space staff set aside non-Covid cases. emergencies need seen well.  Vaxed ppl aren’t dying there’s answer. Hospitals charge million dollars treatment people purposely poison themselves. large countries probably better vaccine roll UK JCVI thank that. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Meanwhile study 1 7 infected kids UK long covid, schools reopening.

So much keeping kids safe. frineds UK life basically totally normal.

Again, people behaving it’s not. I’m sure don’t understand point? people’s behavior one normality doesn’t change Delta spreading rate Alpha Dec ‘20. 7 day average UK 34k cases. **That’s normal.** full, ERs full, people dying high rate like US

I imagine there’s higher vaccination rate per capita UK US. Again, vaccination (or natural immunity) give level immunity prevents hospitalization death. US, it’s something like 80-90% hospitalizations deaths unvaccinated US 11X death rate UK, 5X population.

See point. Also, adjust per capita similar numbers, again, **not normal**.

[COVID-19 cases deaths per million 203 countries September 3, Deaths total (per million): Deaths total (per million): Deaths (per million last 7 days): Deaths (per million last 7 days): 20.96

So, per capita, UK actually worse US terms total deaths US double UK per capita last 7 days. 11x death rate claim. 

So, again, UK isn’t normal friends treating like is. guy read quote healthcare subs, arguing putting actual doctors aggressively possible. thought like know lost is. first 3 died article mentioned none vaccinated. trend happening Arkansas, Missouri, Louisiana. reiterate earlier statement: Delta contagious, policies terrible, suspect virtually everyone infected infected.    That's fair information admit know. extent, used treat parasites humans could help covid far-removed reality, dangerous. 

Being human dewormer, speak, going help things like viruses aren't... know... Worms/parasites. Oh tracking boosters now? Great! Huh? Isn’t Australia 7th lockdown Texas exact opposite? Pass whatever you’re smoking. vaccinated? lack empathy either way appalling. vaccine much higher rate preventing hospitalization though, plus, free readily available US anyway. would, I'm poor. &lt;Stands holds hat heart big, smarmy tears Deaths seem things idiots care about, even hospitalizations happen vaccinated would know trust me. facebook memes factory would flooding content. Well I'm glad live there.   ....gotta fucking kidding me. 'you've told paediatric healthcare workers' trump data available nation's health care system.

What essential recommending risk vaccine outweighs risk possible COVID infection age group, take account broader impact UK government(s) decide.  Ghost reply three weeks later. three week period August, added 500k cases children alone   also interesting people downvote, can't post rational response argument. Everything said risks true. mean I'm anti-vaxer nutter thinks take precautions. However, vaccination end game. better tool better options going forward. live new world post-vaccination. original comment responded said safer high schoolers school. would like know plan then. School closed forever? Covid ever going away. Neither diseases. Based logic original comment never go anywhere anything always safer stay home. Every decision made life balancing risk reward.  Dose happen national level? No. used one area. 

Project please. already michelle obama suggesting people attempting improve school lunches. children also roughly 22.4% unvaccinated population? middle managers, upper management, executives.

In office (where still physically come work, along people), opposite. Middle upper management pretty much checked gone completely silent.

I call permanent coronacation.   sure younger people behaving ridiculously believe basically entire boomer generation brain damage lead poisoning. boss's wife runs daycare 1000 sq ft single story house. wonder spends many days office. Fortunately us work home, allowing it. Damn someway prevent this, maybe inoculation order N95s directly 3M's website days. Reminds doctor went North Korea cure cataracts. Instead thanking doctor went straight picture Kim Jong Il getting sight back, praising thanking crying. ""We must bow Great General. Great (don't know channel clip could find YouTube) hate season 2 Loki. Don’t need advocate we’re already keep mind CFR highly location specific, depending access treatment medical resources individual nations even regions. can't compare Colombia's medical system advanced nations like US UK. better compare CFR MU surge mortality figures months prior Colombia get sense whether variant deadly not, age brackets affected. China Russia working it. Vancouver BC daily flights Wuhan. wonder we've checked old cases. Yep. tell people *want* go home.  real world study barely significant, confounded something else I'm ears.

The real data shows work enough divide country mandates. energy gone putting HRVs every building   No, man. clearly said professionals. Allow light attention context clues, could even safely assume means *medical* professionals.  took advantage every online course available university years, studied hours longer classes due intensity engineering curriculums, filled free time educational content like Khan Academy youtube could learn much possible.

But I'm even suggesting did. I'm saying bare minimum always video stream... even live tbh.  true, Canada engineer protected title.

You cannot use term title without proper licensure,.experience etc.  Love poetry [We know pretty JCVI mandate look community spread, even mention decision something government consider. got J&amp;J, get booster?! district 10% quarentine. thing we're responsible that. However, quarentined kids going movies shit school day hanging friends outside school. parents littles taking over. families using quarentine days take nice family vacation.

Someone actually suggested stop quarantining anyone bc one making sure happens. get frustration, think would create illness deaths. Yes, divide conquer - house divided cannot stand...

If military ~ 30% anti-vax militantly so, could seriously erode capability / effectiveness... Many schools virtual hybrid (half students w/e) last year.

Many kids stayed home / play dates inside activities last year. “What think American culture?”

“I think would good idea.” - Oscar Wilde data. also speculate many places vaccinated people likely get tested unvaccinated (this could regional). sometimes even then, exhibit A, Texas truly think people treated read internally original music dude’s voice  Lol no, ethics exist imperfect world. thought ethics... prepare kinds situations. 

Trolly problem academic exercise, refusing treatment real living person ER isn't.  Yes, know. use purpose . . . purpose. 😀

As last sentence post says, used anything intended purpose unless specifically directed credible physician.

The reason mentioned think folks impression strictly veterinary treatment, hoped clear up. People overdosing shit treated LAST. dont need em planet.    vet trim 11# belligerent fool's claws hulk try it, basically love vet tech turns sweet little purr puddle it. least he's nice patient! False, have. 12-15 eligible medical conditions vaccinated since mid-August.

In extremely rare cases only. missing forest trees. vast majority children vaccinated kind anti-vax idealogy UK government

I think either. however decision contrary evidence reason. vaccines greenlit use children throughout world months now. bit luck, overdosing ivermectin cause sterility side effect. I'm UK parent ultimately trust they're making right decision. made single person voted group competent professionals. understand decision based risk individual rather population (which case adults). hope put limit 25-pound container peanuts. going can't buy 200 pounds peanuts per shopping trip? It’s Oklahoma. 


Source: Oklahoma resident. Probably shouldn’t allow firearms either tbh impression many folks think ivermectin used livestock, that's case.

People think many people buying livestock version feed seeds. people want improve reputation stop that. eh, thing sold corrupt political message keeps Republicans divided voting   Given chiropractor anti-mask, anti-Vaxxer, yeah, I’d say pretty accurate. Surely one actually went college, probably majored biology/chemistry, went medical school listened anything all, graduated bottom class would pretty board masks vaccines.  living studio start pandemic, 1 bedroom office space. makes huge difference me. much easier separate work time work time. 

I really like tips try setting timers dimming lights! horse, duh. fooled Rogan. went got every treatment available diagnosed. guys hot air. Joe Rogan idiot. Listen speak. knows literally nothing things discusses.  Maybe students enjoyed remote learning, they're path back it. work holistic-only fucks day day basis. I’m surprised “doctors”—they 4 year degree—are writing bs letters patients. people believe “stop cancer” enzyme nutrition. No, they'll let kids catch school. they've determined risk kids vaccination comparable infection (certainly false, risk low) 95% adult population vaccinated caught covid.

They also complex modelling suggesting summer wave could save lives next winter, hospital capacity likely tight flu likely back.

Still, crazy vaccinate everyone end pandemic, like several countries appear done. Sounds like lot pathologically fearful (I assume thanks Rupert ilk): ""McElyea said many patients familiar drug. 'Growing small town, rural area, we've accidentally exposed ivermectin time. So, something people familiar with,' said. 'Because accidental sticks trying inoculate cattle, they're less afraid it.'"" sure exactly, anxious though intubated, guess thinking *oh fuck* 🥺 Maybe make infertile keep making idiots. One hope... Well Texas bigger urban areas tens millions sure. OKC Tulsa aren’t even close COVID testing covered cost. 

That said, get PCR test TODAY. Rapids, at-home tests. would enforce this? state article guess completely skipped last sentence. Right??

Epidemiology microbiology complicated fucking fields. Anyone without real training solid foundational knowledge subjects attempting 'research' using Google ultimate fools errand. 

They know know. Add legitimate fear (that share greater lesser degree) health - got someone easily manipulated right cliff. False, have. 12-15 eligible medical conditions vaccinated since mid-August.

This kind anti-vax idealogy UK government, fact ministers want roll vaccines healthy 12-15 year olds must consider JCVI advice take advice Chief Medical Officer.   covid spreading North Korea given removed everyone's teeth? certainly safe right vaccination, vaccine often dehydrates extremely might good workout.

Myocarditis rare side effect happens later. short term inflammation gives slight risk intense exercise. Joe fucking Rogan “First came gunshot victims…” yes, also equates billion dollar republican astroturf campaign keep Republicans entering no-mans-land 'maybe want government based scientific principles cousin steve' point, health care workers able opt oath. fucks sake... Even ivermectin effective. F would take systemically greater negative impact system systemically vaccine made literally salt, sugar, lipids (fats) partial mRNA strand component use synthesize spike protein - alter DNA would take something significantly robust do? get it. Besides that, vaccine preventative least reduces serious sickness/death. reactive. People seriously dumb. Pyongyang style yours, opinion. 

This problem, one wants discuss talk shit. 

You helping cause dude. wasting resources people?? guess risk shopped around doctor agreed (or willing take money) give bad advice like taking unproven medicine instead extremely well-proven vaccine. know still do, loved playing fourth July celebration stone mountain park 90s. Yes, idiocy end. 😢🇺🇸 think fair say discouraging hoarding likely factor CDC went messaging.

However, keep mind even pandemic plans *did* (from GWB Obama administrations pandemic flu) keen mass PPE all. CDC still plans archived 2006 ""Pandemic Influenza Preparedness, Response, Recovery Guide Critical Infrastructure Key Resources"", *only* mention masks entire Although officials documented efficacy surgical/procedure masks N95 respirators, workers may wear one part individual protection Even proper PPE training, employing appropriate infection control procedures, symptomatic workers allowed workplace extreme circumstances sustain essential business continuity.

The HHS updates 2006 2009 mention government bought millions N95 surgical masks stockpile along plastic face shields, gowns, gloves, respirators; context looks like intended healthcare workers.

The HHS update 2017 mention masks all, even list NPIs (non-pharmaceutical NPIs people practice times particularly important pandemic. everyday preventive actions include staying home sick, covering coughs sneezes, frequent appropriate hand-washing, routine cleaning frequently touched surfaces. Community-level interventions added pandemics implemented graded fashion depending severity pandemic; include measures aimed reduce social contacts people schools, workplaces, community settings.

(What I'm able find right pre-2020 pandemic plan document flat-out stated general public use N95 masks; may WHO.)

I remember people frantically searching studies mask effectiveness around March/April 2020 much anything literature. nature masking makes difficult study, almost bad Employers never catch break.

Surely can't worse understaffed closing days going business. Hey, long evil science libs think wrong, gotta right, right?  Honest question here. husband vaccinated haven’t rushed vaccinate newly 12 year old son. Even article, haven’t able see clear numbers compare risk myocarditis 12 yo boys (much different 12-29 cohort mentioned) vaccine versus infection (not vs uninfected all). asked pediatrician—who generally pro-vaccine said risk benefit ratio isn’t clear kids son’s demographic. NHS recently decided same, unless 12-15 year olds comorbidities. anyone link study info shows comparative risk age? No, isn't. gunshot victim critical get bed. like TV, two patients one attending decide lives dies. People landed hospital stupid selfish reasons long hospitals always treated regardless. Given uptake vaccines incredibly high UK (c90% eligible adults) antivaxxers vast minority, UK best UK. scientists believe potential harm (however tiny) good, I’m going agree them. They’ve pretty good track record far.  Nobody’s cutting front anyone, point ethics, laws, policies guide workers hospital job. One treat folks worst right away stabilize others - stable wait bit. say “fuck without vaccine”, you’d often one dead person instead zero dead people. hospital worker myself, least hospital, strive close zero dead people possible. Medical professionals can’t allow personal political feelings get way delivering best care patients possible. Gottleib Thoughts:

""I think Northeast, current number cases true delta wave, delta warning. labor day, true Delta wave build, labor day combined return school, incubator spread.""

""After delta wave, we're going go back normal. HOPEFULLY, real last wave infection going experience. But, going new normal, going become endemic virus that. going circulating every year."" Yes, exactly -- ""These comorbidities make likely need go hospital get infected.""

Which, third time now, I'm talking about. I'm talking people never needed go hospital. People whose covid ""mild.""

But yet months later afib, new vascular abnormalities, cognitive deficit, issues. Thank sacrifice. stayed home, got shots, wear mask. depressed know recommended thing do.    Stupidity knows nationality. feeling wont getting Delta specific shot anytime soon. way stop Delta spread system (except total endless lockdown). reason that. It’s part life forever. indoor masks quarantine positive kids good slow spread won’t stop it. Sooner later kids get COVID common cold. 

just don’t panic. kids vaccinated adults Covid life threatening disease (with rare exceptions). fact, flu way dangerous little kids COVID. real danger unvaccinated adults … it’s choice. became horse dewormer Nobel prize eliminating river blindness developing countries. media calling horse dewormer patently false. Sure people taking horse doses doctors prescribe it. Clearly people sharpest tools shed, IVM administered millions times proven dangerous Tylenol. take horse dose Tylenol would ICU well. bye, liver, bye corneas great, Bob  sad reality. state, Florida, anyone go get monoclonal antibodies free soon test positive. Many people it. Imagine going chiropractor thinking legit medical service though. Data *April 10th* 2021, pre-school reopening pre-Delta.

So yeah, COVID killing kids *when exposed it*. data sets this. 2020 20 people 19 years younger died 28 days covid test. population approx 60m. I've seen many headlines pandemic hard know what's real without hard numbers. also add children 12 conditions vaxed; one would assume would reduce risk death serious company needs kind surveillance, need fire HR department hiring unfit candidates either workers managers. 

Or simply business running business. would test heading back office, market public area un-masked. possible wind asymptomatic. chilling home Labor Day weekend ordering in, plan guests wait out. project instead? always trust Rebar Ricky Facebook doctors pooping chunks stomach lining means working! /s  Ok choose everyone train dies derails. must choose. Americans like “Covid exists still?”

No one takes precautions whatsoever anymore neck woods. That’s ridiculous. Treat gunshot victims first idiots overdosed dewormer die, that’s problem. It’s time stop rewarding bad behavior.  probably witnessed fellow Americans drinking horsey sauce, rather get vaccine, decided end life? that’s silly. already adopt different messaging safety vaccines 40s offered Pfizer jab instead AZ one due different risk profiles.

Everyone eligible absolutely get jabbed, that’s panels qualified people looking risk/reward issues determine eligibility lie. think Texas rabid government, Oklahoma conservatives per capita. hear Texas stuff happens higher level government.

I think reason Oklahoma need get elected office R next name. Texas R also show crazy order bring shrinking percentage R voters. Flipping lever either way immoral. Well since last comment got removed, let’s try again.

What’s wrong people actively hurting drugs told take? get treatment gunshot victim grandma heart attack? didn’t say shouldn’t get treatment; said triaged behind people aren’t harming themselves. Wanting break one thing.

But people see clamoring RTO people always way later needed be. Someone somewhere laughing easily trolled 1/4 population United States, one technologically developed countries world.

Sad day Americans. cost lawsuit essentially another campaign expense GOP. Except tax payers get fund it. get wait lobby... here's lovely chair hallway. kicking out. prioritizing need. best thing read today. &lt;3  Schools focus lot. School started Scotland, cases rose quickly. 

As school resumes rest UK, seems fair expect cases start rise quicker deaths (sort like scenario months ago people saying link cases deaths broken) teacher class two days, symptomatic unmasked. compared younger kids produce much lower viral load (especially asymptomatic). 
Either way, area, schools open weeks cases many classes far outbreak yet (that is, detected class transmission). believe me, area pedantic testing contact tracing would find outbreak. adding counterpoint assertion ""very likely"" one kid gets it, half class gets too. Based data live actually seems rather unlikely.  like gather share stupidity. hate other, gathering doesn’t end well. (And side note, slightly related, reminded me, actually shot home close time last year, say sure get enough dodge point lmao) logical/rational post I've seen course gets voted. mean factory finally pass EMA inspection? long time coming, wonder took long, apply back february? I've done things try help that:

* lights office turn 8:45a 5:30p. gives enough time set begin working clean day work.
* I've also set timers living space. turn 1:00p every day, I'm often taking shower *after* first calls day. idea day, I'm either office, kitchen get water/coffee/snacks, I'm can.
* got door office area, lock 5:30p every night. open next morning--unless explicitly clean room take trash. 

The whole thing giving visual environmental cues either supposed working supposed working. varies massively across age groups. And, said, isn’t risk vs risk decision risk vs risk &amp; reward decision. Vaccines used age group could used truly vulnerable people countries could put towards booster shots autumn months. isn’t vaccine availability also logistics come play, especially U.K. pushing flu jab heavily year. generic drug. money made it. Throw ivermectin patients curb bad idea dewormer eat Abby's regularly. /s don’t know would next best information? 

What follow 60,000 people prior covid vaccine see happens? Could use data make inferences? reinfections 16,215 people 

Vs

238 breakthrough infections 16,215 people

13x breakthrough infections reinfections looking large cohort age, sex, comorbidity matched groups. diarrhea, know working! feel like treatment 4chan prank Gunshots priority. part involuntary. I’m thinking exhausted every possibility

We still long way go. We're barely milk crate challenge stage. INSANE. literally prophylactic (vaccine) keep 90%+ hospital widely tested FDA-approved, yet ppl focused playing Russian roulette they'll gamble un-founded medicine get ill. like they're doubling Stupid. Merck Maybe I'm particularly pessimistic today, believe lost cause. Ignorance misinformation also plagues society able eliminate entire history humanity, ways spread quickly? read article saying 12 people responsible majority covid-related misinformation there. we're believe even 20% country taken vaccine due misinformation (I believe 40% unvaccinated now), 12 people spread false information millions people costing hundreds thousands lives.  unfortunate truth religion progress humanity. Name one great society rising sort religion intertwined with.

Maybe progress humanity right word, instead help control dumbfucks. Natural selection working not? possible result untreated gunshot wounds self inflicted poisoning death. difference often admitted already taking space, gunshot victim shows up. can't kick make room. whoever profiteering stopped. America horse owners horses 🙄. Funny, pay heartworm test dog get PRESCRIPTION monthly ivermectin meds. guess say you’re horse owner, well, ‘tis. hope insurance doesn’t pay stupidity.   know, that’s said ‘Scotland’, UK England. Still doesn’t change there’s need look USA schools open large part UK unlike previously claimed.  can't unilaterally say COVID worse flu. structure influenza virus makes highly suspectible antigenic shift drift. year, there's new strain influenza virus essentially clean slate naive hosts, burn them, killing dozens hundreds kids year year.


Meanwhile, SARS-CoV-2 stable virus. Yes, spouted variants, integrity specific virus largely maintained season season, exposure virus confers longer lasting/more durable protection future infection. bunch naive hosts burn through, level sustained immunity. see flu. reason, one would expect higher morbidity/mortality initially, would come steep drop kids level immunity. yet, despite that, rate death particularly higher flu. apples oranges comparison though comparing one subtype species coronavirus (SARS) entire species influenza viruses, mutate every year. apt comparison would comparing one strain one strain, SARS-COV-2 H1N1, example. Although hard draw true comparison since they're completely different classes. 


With said, could turn long run COVID worse? Yeah, absolutely. seems unlikely based current data know viral structure.  place it’s mostly boomers, including division director who’s literally three decades

I don’t mind going twice week. We’re three times week I’m fan. I’ve got 30 minute commute traffic.   Lease probably. Gen x generation millennials m. They're kids zoomers.. I'm sure zoomers fit they're younger (10 25) arent even eligible vaccine. 18 need parents permission get vaccine would still put gen x anecdotally 2nd dose moderna caused shit I'm still dealing 4 months later, infinitely better COVID honestly want keep shooting forever.    almost eveyrthing said could also applied UK fine pandemic. Life normal. Oh, that’s all, huh 👀 hospitals turn away anyone alcohol poisoning? Anyone overdoses drug? sense, injuries, “shape” victims same. Ran train. argument doesn’t really work. contamination stainless steel fragments shed rubbing part machine puts caps vials. Even fragment small enough go needle get injected arm, cause problems. backwards state slowly going blue. pretty purple right is. Though say I've noticed recent surge Repub crazy policies popular late. shitty living situations, almost invariably. mean:

* Problems domestic partners (spouses, significant others, roommates) indicate relationship maybe best dissolved
* Problems kids 
* living space inadequate needs
* lack social life/hobbies outside work

There also signs they're shitty people bad jobs:

* Managers feel unproductive can't micromanage lord others effectively
* People psychologically *need* gossip lives empty
* kinds people always kind skirted others work
* Business leaders fail understand business
* technologically uninformed can't even hire personnel needed make permanent work-from-anywhere reality

There handful jobs best done offices require centralized location. mean, working something requires security clearance, get going stronger workplace security needs generally managed via work anywhere. jobs exceptional, normal. treating idiots. Let rot outside. explain countires ICU full  That's lot people shitting intestinal lining good reason  Without doubt! can't mental gymnastics required disconnect friends have. nurse ffs. Somebody brings tired point every time make thd comment. Gullible unintelligent synonyms, it’s implicit comment lack ability discern two. There’s irony there. Ah yes, test bunch missiles launch Covid. work. Paywall... high school? Seems Israel authorized vaccine medically risk children ages 11-5 don’t know many kids ain't risking losing Tom Brady looks like SC actually ahead me, probably matter. really poorly right now. Country songs went ""I lost truck, lost dog, lost house"" ""I lost smell, lost taste, lost life"". used bleed people curative (like, actually cut open let bleed bit). anymore, turned bad.

But everyone done died, could claimed bleeding cured them, cured far gone.

Just example came mind obviously harmful treatment considered cure, person survives spite it, rather it. read article?

It mentions exactly happening former ER worker true. Ambulances can't leave patient hospital without bed. ERs beds can't kick patient ivermectin poisoning give bed gunshot victim. I’m defending user. 

**And I’m defending article.**

There’s bigger point apologize haven’t made clear.  scabies, interestingly. Honestly, haven’t seen much news myself. see lot things Afghanistan, Texas, lgbtq issues, racism, celebrity gossip, political stances covid, mask debates, lot this. Maybe missed talked it? move next thing pretty quick media. super weird seem concerned lives children damn parents

From start, concerned enough kids' lives take precautions bring world. Can't say lot parents brought kids world without concern whether right time lives whether would able properly care kids. worries. get it. burnt want nightmare end. 

I wish everyone would get vaxxed, wear masks get with. Stay strong. 👍 believe data accurate.

Our world data says 80% group 60+ (w doses) 20% group 16-59 (2 doses).

I'm sorry that's even lower data Spain is: 92.2% 2 doses group 40+. Yeah, typo. Spain 12.2 points higher vaccination rate 40+ Israel 80+.

67.7% 30-39. 60% 20-29 32.2% 12-19. (2 kids' district mask mandate strictly followed CDC recommendations averaging 8-10 cases per week district 3000. ideal guess better some. 

What really frustrating one case I'm aware daughter's elementary school. Every single case come son's highschool every kid old enough vaccinated. read statistics Covid kids? rare kids severe case even rare kid dies Covid. Every decision make life balance need live life potential risks life. child tens times likely die auto accident firearm die Covid. claim parent drives car children must care little them? 

326 school aged children (5-18) died Covid entire course pandemic. Given pandemic 21 months old, annual death rate 186 school aged children. Flu kills average 37-199 children per year. 2009 flu season killed 358 kids less year. According logic, parents irresponsible sending kids school forever die disease. 

I like current situation would like see options kids vaccine approved them, extreme attitudes based reality helpful situation. love think worlds leading expert education snap fingers fix problems virtual learning. realize jobs done home. Someone grow food pave roads take garbage, etc.  Why? accurate. Also seems Israel start vaccinating 5-11 year olds medical issues (as July 27) really don’t know what’s going numbers England 80% vaccinated. 340 deaths among 20% population, 400 among 80%. may perfect that's still pretty effective, certainly 50%. Thats true, think common killer likely human error hospital setting something, still afraid go hospital. still praise chiropractor went one time get lined know others same. sure getting bashed hard all. Waaaay cheaper doctor visit well actual bedside manor. love modern medicine lets realize based capitalism course flaws. I’m always curious DOs. differ? site linked e-commerce website allowed posts comments.

“The Centers Disease Control Prevention released health advisory last week warning people could become severely ill self-medicating ivermectin overdosing could cause coma, seizures, death.

The milder side effects also unpleasant, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, low blood pressure, dizziness, allergic reactions, according Food Drug Administration.” I'm defending user. person idiot. called quote first place.

I'm also calling article. 

Anyway agree disagree leave that.    kidding me? Tom Brady 44. He’s playing like dude desperately wants avoid home spending time wife kids. can't get Voltron image outta head people start talking chips. I'd PAY it. Ivermectin fan club reposts old articles across internet every days? feel like 9/10 articles lately could easily summed ""Smart people grow frustrated idiots"". refusing take vaccine mind you. school let’s us wear mask Also OP replied said “7% eligible 12-17 year olds two doses” factually wrong 7% comes 0-17 % 12-17 % combining multiple data sets Source?  know, seems Delta response pretty well vaccines breakthrough cases less vaccine tailored specifically Delta antibodies either faded high enough first place. vaccines still help B cells help protect hospitalization death, understanding slow Delta fast, protect much infection, protect somewhat perfectly hospitalization, protect lot death.

Tailoring vaccine theoretically done quickly, practically would take half year year making it, testing it, getting stocked. Adding boosters seem promising Delta means we've basically decided skip Delta variant vaccine favor boosters original formula. boosters set September 20th US, though apparently Biden made promise CDC FDA skeptical boosters needed. Also, people like got J&amp;J ""because first vaccine access best"" completely left dark do, even immunocompromised letting take boosters. funny part concept. stupid ones die off, makes America smarter overall. orthopedist sports medicine physician? &amp; methods: Interaction ivermectin key proteins involved SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis investigated molecular docking molecular dynamic **simulation**.

And sure, complaining media easier, faster, takes less energy using complaints discern deceptive practices happening casual convos around us. 

We agree disagree point; I’m fine either way. insurance fucked America people buying this, COVID, can’t afford co pay?

Yes.  hate company picnics shit, want work office. could give fuck anyone else works office, gimme whole place myself, please. really prefer work work home home

Edit: commute also really short that's big factor  also include decreased consciousness, confusion, hallucinations, seizures

So, difference Keep mind Arians came last week said go beyond guidelines set place NFL. He's damn near locking players hotel season starts. it’s pretty young . Really quick research says 22% UK population 60. dated publication. We’ve already beaten dead horse...dewormer also people hate families, experience. Thanks research. I'm happy number 1.9x group that's double age range. makes logical sense enough question. unrealistic question it.

I agree referencing 0-17 tell anything point. Whole population numbers tell herd immunity, even 5-17 school age range would tell school herd immunity. 0-17 group ineligible less helpful subsets data available. first vaccination ever?  part conversation go? kidding, places going CDC says, want kids back school continuing basis point, kids need either get vaccinated get Covid able quarantine 3 months. understand even people thought vaccine evil, understand virus worse? 3 deaths linked vaccine, whereas millions linked covid. point, getting virus inevitable want continue living life unvaccinated. Ok somebody give real shit here: family fully vaxxed booked Orlando late November (after Thanksgiving) early December. plan getting booster masking least indoors everywhere. consider cancelling?  one keep track everything they're afraid of? surprising, expecting East Tennessean while. 85,000 people attended first college home football game last night vaccination mask policy place, too. Something made themselves. knowing corrupt terrible things there, everything could lie. son tested positive today Covid. wife called school pull son since he's exposed needs quarantine. school informed siblings still need attend regardless exposed long symptoms.

On average school district around 50+ new cases every day. Excellent! Somebody done feed elected intelligent board members. think helps killing intestinal worms feel like understand saying. Unless Nordic countries enact policy, Sweden enacting means nothing. One simply fly Denmark catch train Sweden half hour later. thought wrote ""preventative treatment"" maybe head shoved far ass can't see clearly layers horse manure dewormer I've consuming regularly every available orifice.

Well beeing train Denmark Sweden would foreign travel experts call ""clue"" figuring whether traveling one Nordic country another.

If anything, checking passport would safety theatre. passport know Corona-status. People question flu shot though? difference two flu shot plastered media constantly shoved face really topic conversation. plenty medical workers family really like flu shot get get mandated. like get covid shot get mandated necessarily anti covid shot pro flu shot.  can't admit people hospitals they're full. also found one sub see pro vax people wanting invermectin.

It’s 3 year contract guess. Hopefully sticks around longer remember screaming kids ‘couldn’t get covid.’

Im terrified mandatory testing NYC public schools.

That's enough convince people money motivation People sensory issues, present autism. countries vaccinating 12 year olds? least don’t worms fair parents, virtual working shitshow. 

how shitshow? people willing learn it?

Why fix problems virtual instead killing children? kids mean little all? Maybe lot kids natures way sorting out. Well said “nearly every death” don’t see disagreement here. “Sorry back’s fucked wear cloth face

Kisses,
Dr. B.S. Peddler” anyone know university studied?
Per article: study published Thursday described a Covid-19 outbreak among 150 students Chicago university many unvaccinated students traveled spring break, despite university policies advised it. loved ""Mysteries Beyond Dominion."" even kid, thought ""no way anyone think things true."" adult now... I've proven wrong. I’m VA even though I’d love Dr Avula right, way they’ll available 5-11 September. End October earliest, likely November/December always go back thing saw online human doctors specialized treat minuscule body part, bring vet creature 6 legs, claws, fangs, wings, they’re happy treat matter is. expendable worker, still going work everyday. covid continues surge 2-3x year going see healthcare workers quit, especially anti-vax areas. 

There basically break them, surge ridiculous amount ungrateful patients, offpeak covid deal everyone scheduling elective surgery never get much downtime. This, there’s obviously evidence existence higher power, it. It’s probably way design. “God” something argued facts. That’s it’s called faith. mRNA didn’t like?  battle continues Florida Texas dumbest state. offering free rides get vaccine. didn’t see age requirement, probably need download app. 22.3%according 2019 census.   put mind ease get PCR test Sunday Like one thousand? like one million… possible boil anything make comparisons like tbh.

Yeah, chew swallow thing it'll relieve pain.

Am talking pain med eating food hunger pains?

I say pretty conclusively proven cracks joints provide real relief enough study deep tissue massage (except ""pushing toxins"" thing total bullshit).

The evidence long term benefits deep tissue massage **slightly positive weak**. studies done targeted specific set pain circumstances (low back, headache, fibromyalgia, etc...) usually short duration. 

I've got personal anecdotes worthless scientific data perspective. I've used chiropractic past stopped realized ""relief"" adjustments lasted 15 minutes. I've used deep tissue massage treating specific fucked things (when life arm shoulder example) stop goal achieved. I've going lately fucked knees muscle tightness pulling kneecaps alignment neither injection physical therapy jack shit, I've slowly getting mobility back massage (I'm 2 years knee pain changes 3 months massage dispel inevitable comment ""would fixed waited"")  Yeah virtual last year lot people county put kids day camp style things various daycares parents work person didn’t internet etc essentially person school great news. MMR TDaP shots US immigrant visa eleven years ago doctor gave TDaP booster back May. wife cut rusty nail yesterday went TDaP urgent care good Probably not

I think need kind justification ""I'm selfish prick"". 

They trust science smart enough say outright.  week, talked 2 people Covid last year, got vaxxed year, Covid again. said they’re sicker first time. It’s uncommon think. (PTs) trained screen people risk else, respect neck. lots ways improve neck pain besides using grade 5 manipulations aren’t nearly risky. manipulation really allows anyway chance temporarily decrease pain allow proper exercises permanently decrease it. It’s end treatment won’t solve problem (except sometimes cases acute wry neck). r/whoosh Well 400 740 deaths England Delta among vaccinated folks I’m sure say it’s preventable vaccine. vaccine likely prevented even deaths hospitalizations. think tomorrow good, CDC recommends 3-5 days exposure (if vaccinated) Definitely PCR assholes country insisted need open would allow virtual learning again

why tho?

Virtual learning ton advantages implemented earnestly. Even putting aside obvious benefit pandemic, virtual learning allows slow students go slow fast students go fast, pace. 

It saves gas, saves money, saves time. 

It isolates controls learning experiences schools responsible allowing control social learning making bit separate aspects, allowing sharper focus.


it also encourages tech literacy going needed time goes by.

____

We improving virtual learning even without pandemic tbh, gives great excuse. Remember everyone freaked “faster mutating variant”?  

[turns doesn’t exist.  reported week Tennessee reported cases, definitely higher. least outside Broadway, people putting masks, enough. Rock chalk. first use horse dewormer Evidence what? hate say it, sure like hear this, much person science ignorant assume definitely disproves existence higher power. I'm argumentative real evidence it, evidence used explain material world live in. literally interpret religious text cases, yes lot full fables work stage take away life lessons, however would foolish assume anyone part religious faith adheres reading religious text. frankly hope people unvaccinated ill die virus. way can't spread stupidity around. think world gets little smarter every day people die. Let take whatever want to. stopping this? It’s close get it’s possible it’s probably unlikely. Agreed it’s probably allergies. another virus always possibility. believe Darwinism either. wrong. must wash Ivermectin glycol! Idiots! bright signing moment. aerosols coming patients. Personally think dentists chair one dangerous places right comes covid. I'm going least entire family vaccinated likely hospitals functional again. Yet numbers raging control. 
Can even stopped? I’m really starting wonder. 
Still everything I’m doubts it’s ever going away. Data released today shows likely disappear. People talk imaginary friends considered mentally disabled. Psychiatric wards full them. comparison ignorant? different imaginary friends get counted differently? happening live too. Pretty sure there's FL variant that's responsible many deaths now. US decided go ""we going genetically sequence test results"" approach, unlike name many countries. Still using 45 logic.... tests, problems! submission removed either repost, clickbait low quality submission. Please review sub's rules, particularly rules 3, 5, 6.

One imagine correlation willingness donate blood willingness take vaccine. agree US's numbers terrible well know cases India Russia undercounted factor 10. three badly. vaccine extremely effective nearly every death occurs preventable. Sounds like time find new job. think community 100% seropositivity would much spread. PTs certain states actually order x-rays. honest, PT, I’m happy don’t power state.

/s I'm denying previous infection creates antibodies level immunity; going data study. look forward seeing ultimate findings study are. full good news! Cosmic rays. Imagine standing line hours pay $100 kid become exposed rampant virus there's vaccination for. 

Up next: part II, 'GoFundMe' episode Think vaccines already exist, Jenner’s cowpox smallpox polio, chicken pox. There’s bunch, right? 

No vaccine ever long term effect immunity. Every side effect every vaccine ever invented shown within 2 months. 

There’s reason think one would different. hope well.  HPV HepB viral vaccine 3 shot series spacing - precedent. Sadly yes pretty big ifs...  good news

There's vaccine works really well! Physical therapist here, may biased, agree 100%. goal PT get point don’t need treatment anymore you’re better tools help continue improve. Chiros keep coming back aren’t helping, making dependent. specific times grade 5 manipulations best treatment option, they’re short term fix require proper exercises strengthening follow maintain. 

That’s say chiros like this, vast majority are. 

Remember, PT practice evidence based using academic research show best treatment options. Many chiro schools still teach every human malady cured manipulation (what call adjustments). literally evidence manipulations cure Autism, RA, Guillan Barre, etc, still chiros preaching can. Likely allergies. going happen there's physical door here. good analogy there's photo taken.  school smart controlled crazies would vaccine clinic school name due origin Ancient Greek. one things actually makes sense—‘chiropracty’ would painful bastardisation word. :P Don’t bring poor vets this, wanted treat belligerent fools would gone med school. 

On second thought, know really spicy yet dumb animals. least cute.  secondary use like skin issue. Never ever would think it’s good swallow shit. really trying say horse paste cure covid, yes know it’s available prescription, that’s happening here. seem rational. think deep mesh issues involving distrust authority, political identity, anti-social tendencies, laziness, possible mental illness, list goes on. Bottom line lot people functioning sub-optimal levels prevents making rational decisions. people think Gen z kids eat tide pods too? want feel bad immediately laughing headline but... just.. .. TP count cleaning product? 🤔 easy keep track they're afraid of. They're afraid everything.  almost like..if everyone vaxxed...that even issue!

*Shocked Pikachu* No, pandemic far absolutely traveling we're vaccinated. Besides, planet environment can't afford reckless traveling hope take opportunity adapt.  probably onto something, still think initial zoonotic origin occurred China. SARS-CoV-2 highly similar virus found bats Yunnan province. Chiropractors like used car salesman medical community. rhythm roots! want Covid numbers worse Biden, retroactively make last administration look better.

If guy won, they'd pro-vax. accidentally read ""ER visits increase Karens self-treat"" first even flinch made much sense. :)   think one called r/covidpositive Also east TN. Multiple fairs going on. Bristol putting rhythm roots Festival 2 weeks, mask/Vax requirements. Followed Nascar race next weekend. NETN going dire need totos pears October. fair, vets probably useful chiropractors. believe science, essentially anything agrees Reinfections always common people realized, lot good data it. studies showing pretty high percentage people get reinfected. 

For example, one showing 20% young, healthy people susceptible reinfection within 6 Marine Recruits Reveals Imperfect Immunity Effects snake oil salesmen sold beliefs. identity wrapped lie either put ego aside admit wrong bamboozled, die gripping onto pride. can't even people say excuse me, simply hold door open someone, protect womens rights!?! think ability become self aware enlighten themselves? double graves. 

Ego/pride death human race. “A little reluctant” lol they’re threatening assault kill school board members even try get kids wear fucking mask house dewormer supposed treat viral infection. Please explain, Americans surprised... US education system (which varies state state district district) great hiding dirty chapters history large subset US media great vilifying bring large portion population. First hydroxycloroquine this. politicize drugs like this? makes sense. Let doctors treat you. viruses, yes, others no. totally depends virus, immune system person infected. viruses seem result long term protection, do. know long develop protection natural infections SARS-CoV-2, year half people, long antibodies last virus boosts, according studies, people challenged wild around spreaders. No, doctor working COVID patient, come ER. expect otherwise, people get admitted, treated, hell even go ICU, makes us work around clock save thank Jesus it...

Some still deny COVID (can even get agressive it), feel like idiots, react like patients scared.

It's frustrating see much human stupidity driving pandemic. could go much reasoning make sense (like wanting vaccine makes body create antibodies, ok monoclonal antibodies...). thought got one upvote automatically? PT used adjust hips much better chiropractor ever did. Chiropractors worst anti-thing help keep alivers well - masks, vaccines, etc.  Pretty easy say side effects. Feeling like got run car 24 hours every month? way. I’m glad got wasn’t convenient, hassle really sucked.

I’ll probably get third dose, need honest looking here. virtual learning allows slow students go slow fast students go fast, pace.

Doesn’t imply asynchronous learning? asynchronous doesn’t place, lot students need synchronous learning, regardless level speed. 1. one people look mirror.
2. Identify everyone conform saw.
3. go. better high school students (who get vaccinated) home? risk vaccinated folks severe disease death vanishingly small. maybe argument talking younger kids can't vaccine. even then, severe case rate death rate amongst children stayed low throughout whole pandemic. balancing risks think fair argument making damage done closing schools vs. risk Covid. problem everyone takes one two extreme positions instead treating like complex situation is. One side wants zero precautions wants shut world forever plan ever go back living life. many gunshot victims time? 🤔😅 They’re testing kids 2+ right now, FDA wanted larger sample size see prevalent certain side effects (I think heart issue preteen boys) feel like something I'd hear talk show radio station GTA game. Come on. It’s getting bashed treatment COVID. good evidence benefit plenty evidence people harming it. Furthermore pushed alternative things clear evidence benefits outweighing harm, like vaccines.  That's point. experience modern medicine based fact live capitalist system. grew UK socialised health care. medicine experience depends upon economic system around it. paid health care taxes free point care.

If destroy capitalism replace with, instance, anarcho-communism change people experience allopathic medicine, may well change drives research unto new treatments change nature allopathic medicine.

There medical system made capitalist communist anarchist etc. true herbalism, acupuncture, auyevedic allopathic.  Funny thing is, people causing problems florida Texas would almost happily agree leave Union form united States florida Texas. Drug addiction real thing addicts victims.

I agree you. Yeah hate strong word, thank understanding intent!  loosen restrictions R number rise again.. Ireland something like 93% adults vaccinated yet cases dropped Agreed. nurse friend said ""well must underlying health issues, that's killed him"" anti vax. 🤦‍♀️  I’m glad moved USA Bruh count West Virginia Mississippi.

So, who's got bets holds stock Ivermectin pharma producer also part apparatus pushing people take it? 60%, ok fairly vaccinated?

I ain’t deleting shit boss need better triage system. mention score need pass rigorous 'board exam' 46%. lot questions sound like pulled freshman anatomy quiz. mainstream media burying stories want people cured covid. want harm people masks vaccines.

/s One thing accept medication lot uses humans too, people taking horse dosage, there's zero evidence helps viral infections... meh, we're dumb ones getting vaccine tons documented trials, data, peer reviewed results, easily find data.

But according them, vaccinated people one dying, see overwhelming hospitals, missing something? AZ, couple weeks ago, Costco posted signs. limits 2 paper products (TP, paper towls), 2 cases bottle water, and, 2 packages masks, shields, clorox wipes. husband one people. 

He doesn’t hate us, sure hell hates kids barging home office multiple times day generally loud af time.  Overdosing… people would drug users mostly saying let die. I'm worried super worried cleaning products disappearing again. much country even give shit more. speak walnuts say ""WTF keep us this!!"" Except completely true.

It's also obvious joke. Half people vaccine men. work out, shows vulnerable sensationalist media headlines.  Dammit. hoping go first trip Dollywood October.

Also note Flu deaths usually 37 199 per year. 2018-2019 bad year.

Also note numbers giving extrapolated actual reports, Covid we're limiting numbers actual reports. See Also note, even though individual flu deaths children must reported CDC, likely deaths captured number actual deaths higher. CDC developed statistical models account underreporting flu-related deaths children estimate actual number deaths. 2019-2020, example, 199 deaths children reported CDC statistical modeling suggests approximately 434 deaths may occurred.

To clear, Covid worse Flu children. Came ourworldindata.org graph updated since February. Today 88% 60+ population Israel fully vaccinated, 90% form immunity add recovered (unvaccinated) individuals. granular breakdown, 90.8% 90+ population, 92% 80-89, 93.7% 70-79, 88% 60-69. 


It's indeed possible Spain countries higher portion adult population vaccinated, previous reply made direct comparison Israel's 60% vaccination stats **adult** populations European countries. comparison make sense regardless data is, simply comparing different things. note God?. ""Religious Beleif"" wrote count right?. note god ridiculous thought he\\her exists right cannot proven right? could allergies. it’s COVID symptoms like allergies, maybe vaccine working. He's right though. People distinguish variants testing positive. caught alpha, got COVID. caught Delta, got COVID again, get lambda, got COVID 3rd time. far general mass concerned kept getting reinfected COVID, regardless strain is. Rare, yes. Impossible? No. thing flu. get twice, tell people ""I got flu twice."" tell ""I got Strain A, got Strain B."" 👀 Ahhh yes.. chiropractors horse dewormers... proud state aren’t words sum thoughts: Republicans actually want fucking pandemic end? enjoying this?

We know way end this. Look France Denmark. curves going mass vaccinations. district vaccinated children quarantine exposed Covid. unvaccinated do, policies already place much US following current CDC guidelines.

And I’m interested data shows children still spread Covid less adults. I’ve reading opposite lately. got good links? Didn’t Joe Rogan say part “cure”?

Of course reality also got monoclonal antibodies there’s that.    vaccine would highly recommended 3rd shot 2 shots Pfizer? FLORIDA AF!!! last 6 weeks whilst highest numbers seen 11+. mean that's vaccines shown work, yeah, expect same. It'll endemic, much less deadly vaccinated. Also vaccinated half number long covid. bad parasitic worms  I’m starting show symptoms (runny nose sore throat) going get tested. 

I December, got fully vaccinated May. 

My mom (who fully vaccinated, far know. got first dose summer assume got second) trying say it’s allergies (which I’ve past around time). I’m worried get she’ll start trashing vaccine around people saying regrets getting would cause convince people get vaccinated. Ah, okay. mistake. Question would still stuff get pet market nothing else good humans.

Usually medicine like 1% medicine 99% vomit inducing prevention.

This 99% could different humans. You’re moving actually said. internal reactions words aren’t words, can’t respond factual exchange. I’m blowing off; literally cannot follow keep mistaking thoughts words. kind saw direction going, tried gently guide back present reality request directly quote me. really believe in-person learning priority kids *then must treat like one.* “Ah, rub dirt walk off, you’ll fine” offloads responsibility onto kids, *which works.”

You know adults help protect kids? **Get vaccinated**. also must prioritize safety schools — especially proper ventilation public mitigation tools. 

From article: Kids heading back classroom yet another pandemic school year, time contagious Delta variant getting people sick. Navigating school safely trickier ""Everyone keeps reflecting back last year saying: 'Oh, got school last year, we'll get year', year drastically different,"" Dr. Aaron Milstone, pediatric infectious disease specialist Johns Hopkins Children's Center said child's first-day-of-school **Between Delta variant people going restaurants, weddings large events without masks time last year, said, kids face higher risk getting ""A lot people send kids school last year,"" Milstone said.

They're already treating early wave patients respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), illnesses largely absent last year people staying home.**  Perfect time lower overhead reducing office space letting people work home permanently! Fewer cars road good everyone. parents 70s live Montgomery County, Texas, seriously thinking getting boosters soon prevalent virus county. Yeehaw - Go team quite aware that. point making made sound like big deal. That's me, w foot massages. wrote wedding vows partner give foot massages least bi monthly Sorry engineer previous comment poor attempt humor unfortunate part ones prone type misinformation never great providers. ones leeching great care coworkers provided. Ah see. everyone PT board (except lawyer) also PTs. it’s PTs one lawyer, PTs additional degrees, still overseeing themselves. Absolute scenes get Xi variant discovered China situation. sad. 6 years covid destroys all. I'm depressed Everyone spreads Delta efficiently older variants, including children, children still spread Delta lower rate adults.

I'm sure setting adult vaccination rates low(ish) vaccinated children need quarantine exposed/symptomatic enough stop spread.. not, I'm sure low-vaccine area able allow exposed children school, even vaccinated. see, I'm guessing here, data yet that. ask pizza place deliver straight ER ICU? Would know go? Also ok regards covid protocols? Sorry barrage questions, I'm going it, trying lessen potential issues delivery guy staff. Yeah - data looked really good, too.

There lot cross-protective immunizations; remember TB vaccine particular really good traits.  man US wild feel bad kids god Herd immunity may possible still want see happens communities approach 100% vaccination. suspect virus still get passed around produce many deaths. Possibly, 80% isn’t surprising. 60% adults least one dose. Add documented covid, weren’t documented, asymptomatic never knew it, exposed enough develop antibodies 75-80% doesn’t seem unreasonable. live taking temporary measures outbreaks happen, especially hospital systems threatened many people would like vaccinated eligible yet. Perhaps current wave winter, places access vaccines start treat less seriously, given data suggests third doses WT injection shot already provide like 90-95% protection infection possibly increased protection transmission rare breakthrough cases (we data yet, account third shots new, people them, breakthrough rare), seems weird give act like there's small step take make huge difference spread disease. Also, multiple nasal vaccines tested already, may provide protection via secretory antibodies provide even stronger protection. would phylactry be? That’s privileged way thinking. 

Do think people Alabama means uproot lives, families, jobs go liberal state likely significantly higher cost living? China produced billions inactivated virus vaccines. India many millions own. Many countries produced similar vaccines. Cuba aiming vaccinate entire population locally produced traditional vaccine.

I cannot believe would reach developed countries. 

There also catch. many platforms well known safety profile, pediatric vaccine may available sooner. China already vaccinating children due reason, Cuba follow soon. doesn’t tell us sample population higher prevalence vaccination compared general population. Partner work got email saying contact someone tested positive Tuesday. not, although it’s impossible since always together sit right next one another. 

If possible contact Tuesday, get tested today? Tomorrow? I’m vaccinated feel fine mind won’t rest know sure.

Also - PCR right? rapid okay? percentage overall population children? need know know significance statistic? struggle, sold out.  I've active Dem politics since early 90's lobbied health care reform since 2000. 

That's left Dem Party. anything anymore unless corporate donors approve. fight progressive wing party harder money fight Republicans.  way adapted Citizens United made sell become Republican Party 2.0.  miss them, they're become mean, corrupt ignorant party claim oppose. Maybe right. I'm gonna pretend I'm date latest research.

But know also lot research (including unfortunately high number case studies) indicates chiropractic treatment break neck, cause ""cerebrovascular accidents"" (ie strokes) server arteries near cervical vertebrae. 

That's great risk / reward ratio. I'll stick neck massage. lot places FL, get chiropractor fill forms ok kids sports. outgrowth idea. I’m glad stopping it, logical medical reason wear mask know of. samples antibodies virus, vaccination. Pun intended? assumed referring vaccine. ""Several large studies shown among individuals seropositive prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 incidence reduced 80% 95%, similar vaccine efficacy estimates,"" noted.

""The study continue least December 2021, results made available CDC's website,"" wrote.” also seem generally slimy well.

Friend friend chiropractor.  Everytime would go wanted pick ladies would introduce ""Dr so"" course swoon stuff. Always fun watching face drop tell chiro works strip plaza still lockdown end september easing restrictions cards then. Also finally vaccinating decent rate R-eff trending down. modelling peaking next weeks countries dependent school working parents? Genuinely curious works places. sorry loss. parents need go work public schools afford child care.

When schools “closed” actually still open functioning daycares families parents work provide food shelter family.

So instead bunch kids classes taught teachers, bunch kids classes laptops remotely connected teachers home, additional staff member hanging school watching laptops. Sound stupid? is!

That outcome *isn’t better* in-person classes, cases actually worse in-person classes.

Yes exceptions better parents could afford kids stay home *those* (aka rich) kids offered protection COVID. rich afford anyway care, again, doesn’t really matter.

The real answer, general populace, get vaccinated wear mask. pisses vaccine isn’t available kids, get careful that, kids it’s masks “it hasn’t bad yet.” Unfortunately last part appears changing. Yes, connection sort fraud. example, chiropractor misrepresented medical doctor treat aunt's cancer received 5 years prison. Vaccination really condition employment public safety. use help God already given stay situation.

What help that, exactly? smarts education science? example sick brother? DOs chiropractors. Shit, I'm trying gtfo Florida... even looking taking demotion 100% remote job relocate dime changes surveillance strategies policies may required workplace,” Mills adds, cost hundreds thousands, millions, dollars.

If company large ""surveillance strategies"" costs millions, millions probably drop bucket.

This non-story. July 2020, vaccine available, 3.5% samples carried antibodies SARS-CoV-2, virus causes Covid-19. rose 11.5% December, reported medical journal JAMA. May, 83.3% samples antibodies virus, **most vaccination**.

...and tested ""about 1.4million samples"".

I understand need testing sample sizes population extrapolating wide-scale data, sounds like could go way this, too, say vaccinated people likely blood donors, based sample information.

We already know enough people vaccinated get heard immunity, looks like click-bait headline promising data. news article summarizes findings think waiver would enough prevent estate suing killing you. article states hospitals treating overabundance patients self-ingested horse dewormer. 

How possibly upset that? imply somehow called chiropractic “cure” “magical spirit” nonsense trying cosigning calling chiropractic pseudoscience. Simply treatment doesn’t look like treatment, doesn’t mean better change mine. never said went remission. actually said nothing except chiropractic works &amp; it’s approved/recommended doctor. That’s extent know treatment. I’m asking suggestions. You’re one playing “magic” thinking know anything medical history. 

Trying morph words saying something didn’t say ridiculous. Good luck migraines.

Good day. Thin heard Weakened efficacy infection, still great effect hospitalization death.  people trying close schools 12-17 year olds get vaccinated?  I'm familiar social circles, statistically first doses quite bit - someone taking them. remember quite vocal it, anecdotes may make seem common really is. friend ended hospital exactly needs targeted now. fact doses going up, down, means still lot people convinced. percentage never will, that's true, know yet, #1 important thing ending pandemic pushing adult vaccines high possible. Children cherry top. course new vaccine-resistant variant could appear though ….

A new variant could make vaccines useless improbable, impossible, think worst could happen mutation makes vaccines reduce efficacy even happens would still work normal hospitalizations deaths now.   antiviral properties vitro (that means lab test tube) concentrations high dose high human would kill them. party pro life again. Got 3rd soon opened up. I'm fine. Everyone knows demons stored balls / ladyballs actually, Ivermectins FDA approved humans since 80’s. Though worms, obviously Oh poor poor millionaires making money suffering depression workers Food scale optimistic. probably like “well horse dose one tube I’m quarter size horse I’ll eyeball quarter.” Mmhm, really.

As Medical Doctor maybe, even likely need medical doctory things crime, saying MD going issue. discovered dude said ghost told extra strength sin stains add power thoughts 1:1 ratio power prayers, reformulated contain divine cleansing fire action apply genitalia open orifices, see God's MSDS book safety information. standard reply anyone thinks ACA good plan spend year using it.  adult children stuck years terrible, expensive coverage. bronze plan pocket deductibles range $5000 $7000 per year. means paying $700 $1000 per month insurance can't even use spend thousands dollars. Hideous. Democrats hang heads shame.

Maybe next time they'll try polling people actually use ACA.  Applies emergency use authorized vaccines only, Pfizer require parental consent. sure comparing Israel's vaccination status entire population, EU's **adult** population, given main reason Israel stuck 60% due large % children. adult population 80% vaccinated, 90% 60+ age groups. Get mRNA booster. I'd moderna you. think impacted bad covid gets, indirectly since covid gets bad control/experimental groups catch covid. hit XXX cases need determine effectiveness whether takes year month Technically, lich. explains lot. Hope things get better you.  get revaccinated MMR Hepatitis B couple years ago. also got Tdap last year. 80% blood donors. Perhaps donate blood inclined get vaccine. Damn, dude waging biological warfare state, country, rest world

It'll never happen, I'd like see COVID tribunal punish people power actively sabotaged public health efforts aggressively enabled continued spread COVID someone shed light Ron DeSantis moron? think states ever really contact tracing...  completed Pfizer series March, got moderna booster 3 days ago. arm pain stuff subsided still feel run kind of…. Wrong. 

Anyone else got booster different vaccine? similar experience?    people hide work mentions green pass system understand right need access “many leisure activities” along public transportation

So guess plan make lives incredibly miserable cave It’s important note often find drugs serve multiple one comes mind. It’s shown promising results wide array uses. logic, it’s “boner pill” since that’s intended beginning. 

Ivermectin seems similar drug may provide protection things worms/parasites. links NIH. 

Social media tribalism promote two-dimensional view every issue. ivermectin either secret antidote “horse-paste.” reality, it’s neither those. Same. got vaccinated soon possible returned normal life part. I’ll wear mask it’s still required (public transit, planes, hospitals) still opt dine outside it’s option longer big deal.   comment irrelevant post. 

The anti-vaxxers cult. wouldn’t right choice?  know caught Biden Administration many lies. can’t tell truth dog many times checks watch. Total embarrassment. anti-intellectualism. “idiocracy “. makes sense. I’ve seen articles shaming antivaxxers doesn’t work I’m trouble feeling empathy people reject kind help advice experts yet pursue scams con artists. It’s pathetic sad point. Add aggressive reaction people. Punching retail employees peeing store counters. Spitting nurses. suppose take people seriously? aggressively ignorant. don’t patience deal anymore. 
Sorry. End rant. Add that, people Germany, France Spain wearing masks whenever leave homes. Even vaccinated. lot public places Paris, wearing mask mandatory, even outside.

This probably reducing spread Europe much. guess something, harmed himself, embarrassed admit fuck up, blames vaccine since en vogue community. true, would spectacular technology. 

It would mean someone figured create nanochips, deliver body via needle, course several weeks months, chips seek find human body, self-assemble larger chip, find way power stay powered broadcast 5G.

That amazing Star Trek tech right there. cousin, half Filipino, moved PNW Oklahoma.... always thought weird. New covid cases Oklahoma increased 21% 14 past days. 

Oklahoman's overdosing Ivermectin still coming covid. hospitals packed covid cases Ivermectin od's.

How stupid get!   America! work hospital NYC, yeah... we'd planning make vaccine mandatory FDA approved anyways, state government made decision us mandating hospitals state.

I believe goes effect mid-September. Medical exemptions only, anyone requesting medical exemption request reviewed team within employee health services includes couple doctors. Virtual hospitalization certain point gotta cut losses bad actors started spread ridiculous disinformation sitting back laughing us. 🤦🏽‍♀️ 🎵 Momma back sippin Ivermectin

Her eye ruptured ain’t worm infectn’

Of horsey dewormin’, tasty gullet, Ivermectin  I've eating lot spicy food. can't taste directly seems trigger sensation normally get eating something really hot kind like flavor. remember reading somewhere last couple years Onion writers trouble coming stories ludicrous reality totally believe it. crap studies, trying promote ivermectin 

Only low quality studies shown positive effect ivermectin. Better ones show positive effect good meta-analysis also backed 

More people need understand studies created equally. study comes certain result mean taken face value already rejected arguments everyone actually educated competent field. going swayed reason evidence. waste time you?

""If could reason {religious people/flat-earthers/anti-vaxxers} would {religious people/flat-earthers/anti-vaxxers}"". exactly anyone else said. They've speculated number mutations, potential evade vaccines, there's hard evidence one direction so. Absolutely, it’s obnoxious trope. know dual PhD thinks 9/11 inside job.

And get “being good school doesn’t mean you’re smart”, bunch mental giants think cramming freshman English contributing dozens highly cited papers unique, pioneering science quantum mechanics. 

You don’t get PhD shit unless you’re *actually* smart. can’t fake it. can’t memorize study way there. tried. dropped masters going get kicked out. Why? certainly wasn’t wasn’t trying! studying lab 18+hrs day, every day. dropped wasn’t smart enough. took 12hrs would take others 6. working 12 day more. math one… I’m comfortable fact now, don’t need lie make feel smarter are.  Instead thanking doctor went straight picture Kim Jong Il getting sight back, praising thanking crying. ""We must bow Great General. Great General.""

You're assuming actually believed said engaging pantomime would free consequences. ive checking sub ever since got vaccinated. I'm really confused probably due concentration anti-vaxers. While, e.g., Europe, large clusters anti-vaxers spread mostly whole continent, US separated state. gives virus fertile ground grow on.

The saving grace US low population density, especially south. E.g., city Orlando population density lower rural areas France Germany. mention towns much farther apart. population density, virus would burning population much quicker. think lot preppers well. afraid race riot non whites come take home food.  least didn’t get vaccine cause sore arm whole day take horse dose Tylenol end liver damage quite likely die suffering horribly two weeks.

The LD Tylenol awfully close DD.  point say ""you made bed, lay it"" ""play stupid games earn stupid prizes?""  Literally dumbest timelines.  Yeah that's rich people get prioritized broke people /s thank governor that. anyone explain… haven’t able gather. freedom lovers overdosing horse dewormer even don’t Covid? Like way King Nightmare taking Hydroxychloroquine (wrongly) preventive? Covid take horse dewormer mostly OD freedom horse paste? vaccine stopped spread would see massive drop cases instead they’re going up

This claim sort countered fact vaccination stop spread.

But long kids unvaccinated caught COVID yet, delta cases going rise.  part wishes could close know won’t happen :/ it’s really sad see many people actually really selfish pandemic. hoping anti-vaccinated group saw hitting kids hard they’d want try, guess :/  Australians basically British Texans.

Or I've told.  get tested health department mass testing site? Doesn’t disney similar rule urban legend hastily cart dying guests off-premises happiest place earth stays happy happy happy?  Yeah bars live crowded last night know, part crowd. mask sight. whole lot people done giving sh-t, whole lot never gave sh-t begin with. gave sh-t, got vaccinated, low risk basically gone back living life 2019. throw mask I’m getting train bus, that’s it, fear Covid don’t want jerk. live area northeast took super seriously summer hit. Nobody wants hear around here, social end pandemic big chunk USA already awhile. GJ Joe Rogan live oklahoma, lot dumb people.. confirm  Yes, seems like every week. Sure, I’m focusing black mirror reference. You’re recommending assign social score people stop misinformation. even watched show? You’re literally advocating one episodes depicts. Lol. happens defund educations system.   Listen, hate people too. fuck life, job, work home fuck ability think things… realize you’re saying sounds ridiculous. 

Are people shitty members community? Sure. America. People broke, confused, stupid, filled propaganda six ways Sunday. Prices healthcare already sky high. can’t discriminate saying “you’re shitty people don’t like pay 5X more!” already pay lot they’re first place. 

It already bankrupt them. Many indeed get fired. bet ass insurance companies already devising plans make insurance cost more. Insurance companies greedy parasites they’ll take everything can. can’t destroy lives top that. people like us made bad call likely world punish accordingly. that’s us. 

It’s slippery slope wish death/poverty/harm people. breathe. We’ll get this. Surely satirical? dumb enough take it, first thing would figure correct dosage schedule taking it. like going take fun drug kicks, make sure know getting into. feeling lot better people it. Tractor supply company livestock stores. Even pet smart notices saying even ask it. double cases unvaccinated children, increase cases elderly 20%, expect increase deaths similar +20% rather +100% 

That's part wrong. double cases unvaccinated children we're also doubling cases vaccinated grandparents, raising 20%. ratio cases dropped (but dropping further), ratio change rising cases.

If cases double, deaths too. thought Florida Australia United States.  It’s good, running joke going around caused diarrhea.  Maybe priority placed take horse meds vaccinated? choose guy's cat Nope... people found excuse go outside 2019 Denial huge reaction fear anxiety. talking response climate change *years* now.

It's coincidence ""indifferent"" people ones physically assaulting anyone reminds pandemic. Can’t catch COVID dead. That’ll show ‘em! forget put position *by design* - R elite made sure that. ago anti-vax narrative money control. I'm vaxed best person give opinion, however, honesty like makes trust way less guns, though. simple. hospitals become crowded, get backed up. hospital operating normal tempo normal amount staff, patients treated effectively means faster, including faster discharges. start pushing things bring, staff get burnout, staff quit, running around like chicken head cut off. patients start piling faster tend them. run supplies. load keeps increasing collapse even after.

Meanwhile countries, they've stuck ""balance"" infections vs mitigation efforts leads manageable hospital. People get in, get treated (or die), get discharged.

I feel like writing book make analogies mesh perfectly, especially since I'm getting troll/antivax vibes.... get point.  antivaxxers pump full ANIMAL MEDICATIONS can’t take vaccine that’s intended humans?????? I’m out, man. can’t idiots.  people forced wait assault victims get treated It’s spreading variants around, including us spreading variants others. Dentists push group take normal health insurance rather B's discount plans call insurance. They’re probably worried new variants brought frequently traveled places like South America. say there’s anything bad South America, absolutely isn’t, rather kind thing dangerous variants spread globally lot movement countries. example, see Mu. That’s I’m saying, people rejoicing don’t understand slippery slope.

Okay, won’t except note chiropractor? What’s next? acupuncturist? sage? herblorist? stop accepting medical notes herbalife dealer? pampered chef dealer? Grand Dragon? drug dealer? gas station clerk buy cigarettes from?

I mean start chiropractor. they’ll take away people trust health. experience except dad fucking doctor mom fortunately realizes I'm smart one family. feel least fraction pain. funny chiropractor I'd stuck pain meds rest life. PT actually made pain worse times. know quacks good ones believe science help people.  48% 12-17 year olds Nevada one shot that’s fucked too. Vaccinated Europeans let months ago. Honestly though, want mass international travel right now, given country currently looks like? seems like responsible thing stay home we’re less mess, “keeping people out” part protecting general population, especially considering state tourist areas.  Yes rules. rules Chiropractors Board simple: Make sure give us cut. 

This 'individual' thing, 'a bad apples' thing, Chiropractic whole nothing large group conmen/conwomen banded together protection, convinced large number people legitimate called 'Doctor'. They're essentially witch doctors. It’s 7% 0-17 year olds. 32% 12-17 year olds Alabama one shot. great better 7% That’s “give man fish he’ll eat day” thing comes in. You’re supposed rely God every little thing. You’re supposed grow develop good person. 

Then course everyone can’t manage simple ask, there’s always prosperity gospel. models I've seen show peaking October 2,000 4,000 cases day. Yoga going instantly align bones. yoga want matter something place stuck needs chiropractor get fixed. 

First, want say understand 'quack' chiropractors good ones, too. I've spine problems years (including pinched nerves, sciatica, etc) make migraines worse. done physical therapy still yoga exercise daily every months something gets stuck needs adjusted chiropractor. PT actually worsened pain times. ever see chiropractor, I'd basically stuck relying meds manage pain symptoms instead fixing cause chiropractor. chiropractor I've gone entire life like nuts I've heard believe science. 100% vaccinations masks require certain patients first get approval doctor touch them. good chiropractors provide necessary service otherwise would cause people put meds suffer pain. what? vaccines 12. do, also tend stay babies. long breastfeeding continues varies widely. hate healing crystal b.s. like rocks.

Wtaf going America right now? yall OK? definition Darwinism? 


...Never mind got it. nobody ever suggested that? /s Wow thanks i'm sure cured now. YouTube. “Doctors” done many “studies” “prove” effective. anybody know safe go gym go running receiving 2nd pfizer jab? Arkansas? headlines today. Oklahoma got beat! Shhhh Florida, stay Witnessed personally, denying reality, even face respiratory failure without immediate medical intervention. Person arrives, barely get truck. ""im dehydrated"". er/urgent, pulseox super low, like 60% range, doesnt want consent anything, final does.  hour later, course still sick, we're talking elective intubation admission unit, person signs AMA (against medical advice), husband f-ing TAKES HOME.

She likely died, maybe went somewhere else. never looked chart see admitted, dont care anymore.  you’re saying I’m shot, take ivermectin. articles? Like obviously employers pushing them. care! Save money boss. I'm never going back. People posting good experiences bad faith.

People posting bad experiences often posting bad faith.

Also, people leave good reviews things like refrigerators. They're supposed work, would leave review? insane people like leave good reviews refrigerators. vaccines. end majority bad experiences reported, reality they're tiny fraction total.

You say that's bad system, better alternative. South Africa went Ivermectin hysteria months ago. can't even......  Interesting thing breakthrough covid eventually recovered. covid-induced bronchitis eventually resolved. I'm frustrated even show empirical evidence back fact vaccines masks work covid kills, they'll say biased manipulated, happily gobble anything politicians support say without research. Like yes, I'm sure Ted Cruz knowledgeable covid actual epidemiologists. course Internet fuck shit providing legitimate looking articles sources absolutely viewpoint world. googled ""is Earth planet universe"" found bunch ""articles"" saying yes, fact planet universe. Sure. That's fair Google friend! true! vet completely overwhelmed. hire least one vet total three doctors four additional vet techs total 12. 

People time home pets notice everything bringing exams like crazy. mention recently adopted pets. Appointments scarce schedule same-day appointment it’s extra $50. 

So keep damned idiots away vet’s office.  We’re moderna? 

I see Pfizer peeps fine multiple boosters. 

I moderna I’m least waiting half dose boosters get approved. always character stand bullies, whether real-life online. one order kn95 masks trust? spamming Ivermectin info studies:  appreciate zealous defense ""promising"" mildly effective treatment, post people self-medicating veterinary pharmaceutical. 

The discussion clear accurate information and/or limitations Kansas health care system. Maybe.....but think clearly say 100% case ivermectin vs mixed guns That’s point. point providing “medical exemption,” practicing medicine. Also, much agree you, FL law say chiropractors may diagnose illness is, definition, practicing medicine. goal come back in. He’s trying keep able come decision. don’t think disclosure huge deal, making easier them. ask produce data

The argument usually ends they'll hit ""do research"" response. Merck. make it. hilarious bc people taking tend also talk big pharma doesn’t want know it. scares me. don’t blame doctors HCWs leave profession go hiatus salvage left mental (and physical) well-being. it’s frightening imagine post-pandemic shortage medical care. Antibody titers weak evidence. gold standard real world infection data based ongoing studies areas variants actively spreading.

So far, show *similar* protection one shot J&amp;J vs two round course mRNA severe illness delta variants.

There hypotheses might case investigation including type vaccine eliciting wider *spectrum* antibodies thus effective variants, immune response widespread thus localized critical areas prevent infection. believe social darwinism. believe evolution, discredit believe creationsim. ""critical thinking"" == cherry picking talking points social media feed.

That also ""fuck anybody spent years getting brainwashed damned liberal colleges &amp; universities"". Exactly. Great way say it. outdated people pick choose. worst part use weapon(I guess really always weaponized, read old testament), sort moral superiority? creates delusion people are, sense, brainwashed.

To add, understand point religion history humanity, way practiced understood outdated now. pandemic?

/s Well taking hospital beds CDC would stop telling doctors prescribe human version. Ivermectin cheap safe low doses fucking let take it. 

This ""horse paste"" media hysteria causing problems solving. Poison control calls due veterinary ivermectin overdoses *gone up* since ridiculous headlines started published. Pharmacies starting refuse fill ivermectin prescriptions actual doctors people resorting animal compound. completely dishonest representation ivermectin going erode people's trust public health institutions already abysmal. commenting statement humans bad long periods vigilance. I've opposite experience Asia. gunshot victims probably much fault stupidity injuries ivermectin people quite frankly many parents don’t want vaccinate. make mandatory, like necessary vaccines needed school. Bad math guess actual prevention free... continues endgame either forced vaccinations, unvaxed Covid get denied care Covid issues(or cap many beds go unvaccinated Covid patients), healthcare draft. Ok, opt masks, opt uniforms, shirts, shoes, course requirements, etc?

Because provide opt masks, think able opt things kids. questionable stats even reported accurately Tennessee govt think really matters point. Even tracing there's reason believe they'd accurately portraying spread contacting people appropriately. Wyatt Earp country Oklahoma? many gunshot victims line behind ivermectin ODs shootout behind corral? Poison control hang tell pray it. least India, probably mostly intentional. India's richer metros solidly middle income country territory, India whole still extremely poor. Real nominal GDP per capita $2,100, real PPP GDP per capita $7,300. puts around Honduras, Uzbekistan, Angola, Ghana, Syria. comparison (in PPP), Brazil $16K, Mexico $20K, Turkey $32K. 

Tests cost money, outside richer urban areas, testing happens microscopic scale. Even tests, reporting infrastructure always get back central health authorities report.

As I've seen extreme reactions masks common sense precautions, I've wondered people afraid able process fear. uncomfortable feel fear. 
 Perhaps emotionally feasible react anger, even misdirected. armchair ponderings. I'll read studies, thanks. article July 2020 though, Delta specifically.. I'll condition statement ""there's evidence Delta changed age-related transmission rates. studies showed evidence children could spread efficiently getting particularly sick themselves, remains unclear"". think evidence becoming clear hell lot prevent infected, especially Delta variant. course protection declines time.

Nobody’s saying “full protection” anymore. haven’t months. It’s strawman. 

The evidence clearly shows unvaccinated folks **five times likely** infected sars-cov-2 vaccinated folks. 

And yes, vaccines wane time. said, evidence shows multiple magnitudes increased immunity third dose. 

In meantime, almost *all* evidence shows mitigation measures effective work best layered. 

Please stop repeating disinformation. Save horse, treat cowboy! (With ivermectin!) Yeah, Ebola hemorrhagic fever comes lot internal organ damage makes especially deadly. also spread direct contact bodily fluids rather air like COVID. hypothetically got ebola, would probably dead hospital chance pass someone else. Keep mind *among infected first place*. 50% reduction post-acute symptoms study addition decreased risk getting infected first place. understand; want *billionaires*, duty support them!

There drowning man. boat came tried save him, said ""no thank you, God save me."" Another boat tried save said ""no thank you, God save me"" drowned. got heaven said ""why save God?"" God said ""I sent two boats big dummy!""

The boats represent vaccines masks. Like tools disposal ancestors faced pandemics plagues technology people still appreciate them. Religion outdated like everything, must updated current times. Besides, many people conveniently religious. Like following religion that, say, allow vaccines also allow pre-marital sex, people still pre-marital sex fun simultaneously saying religion allow vaccines. anyone comes me, I'm talking specific religion - used first two examples came mind. I’ll bet veterinarians don’t want see either.  Shame census last year. always true though.

Seems like need reprioritize triage help actually need deserve it. death They’ll meet sooner think. lower risk work address comorbidities have.

I yet see firm evidence people fewer comorbidities less likely, given infected, develop serious medium-term long-term problems.

Again, talking going hospital. I'm talking needing go hospital, lasting cognitive deficit. People never needed go hospital, whose covid always ""mild,"" end afib vascular changes brain. disturbing me.

I constantly find kind posts says ""the country"" I'm like....

Tough hide bodies tho.  That's fair think unlikely. However, think better focusing ""1 20"" (odds getting long covid) ""1/2"" (reduction risk). already vaccinated know absolute odds. you, there's real advantage comparing unvaccinated. I’m honestly conflicted getting vaccine. media articles come really confuses me. Everyday there’s new article vaccine isn’t great intended, may cause heart disease, new variant vaccine won’t help, need booster shot. 

I’m refusing vaccine want accurate information know I’m right thing it. Honestly wish could get help, like said message lost everyone angry misinformation going around. guess I'm numb done people's intransigence gleeful ignorance. scream incoherently get vaccinated mock us ignore us, find flailing limbs ICU can't breathe COVID-19 wrecked lungs... whatever. feel sorry people experience sorrow grief death. death itself?

Follow psych doc that. Yeah, US treats veterans well... add death certificate issued backdated actual death massive increase deaths, backed things bit. would imagine deaths continue added least middle September.

You'd need control study done exact test get answer question.

All available research suggests mRNA booster shot absurdly effective, even top already extremely effective first doses. clear, *if get infected*, probability covid-related symptoms 28 days ~5%, according study.

Dentists medical professionals education concentrated dental issues. Podiatrists medical professionals education concentrated foot ankle issues. Physicians broad medical education. 

Physicians sometimes refer patients foot problems podiatrists. Podiatrists refer patients medical problems beyond foot physicians.  honestly both. infections go ending lockdown (looking Australia five lockdowns) people absolutely protest. wish set game plan, understand there’s not. There’s many variables many places. 
But I’m also wondering restrictions you’re referring to? Besides masks certain places, life seems pretty much back normal US.

Here's old article first started it. 

“There 250 people program today — 50 patients discharged out. could easily say least half, more, patients would admitted — least observation —and taken internal 100μg/ml concentration ivermectin higher cytotoxic  ivermectin strong antiviral potential 100μg/ml higher

this made laugh lol referring mechanism underlying damage caused ivermectin overdose, likely due drug holding open chloride channels resulting excitotoxicity cell death. 

If meant generally, idiots eating horse paste quack doctors various online morons promoting idea ivermectin treat prevent covid, ""experts"" generally citing two studies claimed demonstrate effect. One study used fraudulent data, severe statistical errors analysis corrected render original conclusion spurious. mean...*i’m* okay. Idk republicans... Sending love hugs xoxox  Yes saying watching USA due hospitalisations increasing pointed already far relevant data use UK something I’m sure considered.

Your subsequent replies seem scratching around try right something much point continuing this.  Thats solace too, work collateral damage. Know what? Let's stop trying warn let problem sort out. Pretty soon anyone left hinder progress. Florida shit hole. beaches don’t make garbage state is. never go reason.  even triaging people people poisoned gunshot victims? clear bed put person chair hallway hallway let gunshot victim bed. really think there's dilemma here, solution ideal.

Making pregnant women wait get vaccinated baby born, even though expecting mothers higher risk, effectively values baby's health mother's life. person never told risk life someone else *may* face unknown consequences.

Babies valuable adult humans. absurd many people think babies matter mothers, somehow normal, revolting. Dumb fuck bucks please stop. I'm tired exhausted dont know anymore. Sending love hugs xoxoxo  There’s nothing stoping anyone getting 3rd shot now. wife got 3 rd shot cvs last Friday.  Seriously worried yall. sister CO, fairly progressive staying safe damn scary imagine like yall living there. Sending guys love hugs. anything else across border/internationally this? feel helpless. medical profession make moral value judgements people's medical condition.

Ha, except literally do. guess completely ignoring transplants? Literally priority list, alcohol last 6 months? Bottom list. previous organ donor? Top list.

This absolutely done. Honestly that's solace kinds deaths. them, would rather people exasperating issue die rather people innocent. get it, week weeks, skip what-about-men talk? Well according article, seems plurality people (45% according study cited) would rather work office full time seems inline Ivermectin anti-parasitic drug used treats parasites humans- covid parasite.

And people literally taking horse dewormer feed stores. Yes contains ivermectin also bunch ingredients dosage suitable humans. No, don’t.

Source: lived China, got drunk NKs. teeth. I've read horney sauce, would viagra juice? TrIGgereD Right, like saying (for COVID-19), ""chocolate bad, vaccine good."" Chocolate studied adequately treatment COVID-19, used such. Likewise ivermectin.

/u/Throw08oot making valid points, right instant, flattening conversation ""ivermectin bad"" helpful harmful.   It’s poorly written. Looking state level data massively deceiving. looking county level data. example western Washington basically different state eastern Washington    me. Definitely cut off... 40% people want return office full time? 20 something % want hybrid? seems extremely suspicious me. Well let people want work home, work home. let people want go office, go office?  Study posted user above: come nowhere, research suggesting certain anti-parasitics might anti-viral properties well years. global pandemic feel researchers would dropping ball *didn't* research ivermectin similar drugs effect covid. Nobody going local livestock store buy farm grade ivermectin, people writing ""horse dewormer"" intellectually dishonest. research needed.  Uh wut? Viagra wasn’t meant intended boner pill initially. Damn clueless Select European countries recommending mixing doses awhile get best effects. 

And moderna shown higher efficacy gassing variants Shit thats quite lot!

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Lol fucking republicans anti vax pro gun.... I’m TN. kids’ schools closed next week “mitigate spread.” Hardly anyone wears masks (we wear them, including kids school). 

And yesterday learned uncle hospital covid. dad says unvaccinated. 

😐😑 know think JCVI recommended vaccine family circumstances specific risks address. understand people ODing horse meds get priority anyone else. I’m 90% convinced origin taking horse dewormer work foreign troll laughing ass stupidity going Good point, shhh don’t talk like around here. Ivermectin victims back line  I'm sure someone's hamster deserves care folks. Maybe send another country treatment?
Could send Mexico? Stupidity become pandemic cries Saskatchewan 1. anything they’re understated- it’s fairly 
common. 

2. all. come hospital card quick look database would show they’re vaccinated. 

3. Yes is, forget exactly generated which, two types antibodies, one created actual infection another appears infection vaccination.  Nashville healthcare hub whole region. We're level disaster lot hospitals.  Yes, kids fine. Cases high risk severe illness remains small. getting scary news stories US. you’re nervous actually don’t think vaccine works. 

Relax. grew different part country guess fairly bubble came OSU college. really wasn’t much later realized freaking weird rest state is. us absolutely fucking kept kids home. Fixed thee case anyone curious: matched case control study. 
 
They even remotely gold standard. They're basically preliminary study maybe hints something might useful. 
 
A review 14 Randomized Control Studies showed effect ivermectin COVID: 
 
 
31 studies ivermectin ongoing planned. 
 
TLDR: concrete evidence effectiveness ivermectin. Lots effective.  Gun shot victims definitely take priority idiots OD Ivermectin Haha friend broke arm falling tree didnt health insurance literally would smoke bowl bowl day long handle pain. think roommates finally drug doctor could see arm healing fucked waited week think lol. Hes fine luckily.  Hi! anyone please explain one thing connected washing groceries? I've read virus transsmited way covid-positive person coughs hands touches product, minutes another person takes hands, brings home touches eye nose. likely transmission? avoid cases grocery washing useful, it? 613 mitzvot, commandments even though words used interchangeably English. Mitzvot good things one do/accomplish. opposite commandments, commandments one must *not* do. fact, one mitzvah literally ""not add commandments"". Oh that's great way it. tough going whole military approach literally force people get shot like not. never read one newspapers, I'll tell right now. honestly don’t think anti-vaxxers possess mental capability seriously make educated informed choice. They’re much better co-morbidities. Either way, odds stacked start. 

I saw clip unvaccinated couple dying two days apart. happened close live. poor daughter stated entire family except two vaccinated. understand made choice, that’s entire family made right choice get vaccine going traumatic heartache.

It doesn’t matter try rationalize suffering, still sucks see happen.  They're assumption patent expired generic big pharmacy make it.

The companies make generic human ivermectin one makes livestock ivermectin multimillion dollar businesses. 

You can't spin business Jimbob boys make ivermectin, expensive do. Well... expensive kill fuckfaces immediately inject suck livestock version. aren’t guidelines right now. Right now, authorized give boosters people currently going chemo, HIV+, taking steroids suppress immune system, people organ transplants. use Ivermectin company makes said work covid treatment. 

Are people taking dosages meant livestock? that's one way shitting organs out.  It’s county live in. Putting moral arguments aside, agree sentiment. start charging higher premiums (similar smokers).

These folks dragging whole country behind... Scotland's rise began schools went back. increase rapidly though.  Same! teach Virginia though it’s completely different world! Tennessee schools hit like crazy, actually decent compared them. mask mandates covid rules.  Interesting isolated grandma middle nowhere, close proximity international travelers via military base, contracted COVID early.

I believe San Diego case also indirectly associated military travelers.

Those amended cases, I'd curious whether also associated military bases travel.  they? answer second question... lol can't kick make room.

Which unfortunate. totally get can't it, sometimes wish could exception. Sadly, exceptions get abused, 'no exceptions' proper way.  point becomes international news ERs getting backed up? really think happens lot (first world?) countries. first world countries enough gun shot victims make ""gunshot victims wait treated"" problem. Hindishgt 20/20 ... 

Definitely people charge better info myself, definitely paying attention COVID, thought done shite (even went Disney World, fully vaccinated); definitely expecting ICUs full vaccine available. stop treating ODs. can’t real cause permanent damage? Ivermectin comes oral tablet form humans well. say it’s safe pop like it’s multi vitamin though. It’s used specific conditions.  Yeah deflect criticism keyboard warrior boost Moderna given Moderna generates higher antibody level provides longer lasting immunity? Feels like boost vaccine specific blanket 6 month last dose.  r/covid19positive bigger group one OP linked. Cheers. That's fucked up. FWIW, took years get everyone get first polio shots US. rollout hit big snag rural everyone, urban blacks, Native Americans while. rollout slowed way around 1960. Source: Pandemics Society (book) eventually overcome part switching sugar cube vaccine larger part rollout.  guarantee every person taking horse meds made fun kids too. Misinformation convinced certain demographic treatment via ivermectin superior alternative vaccines. understand actually makes feel horrible.  wasn't, Florida would elected moron instead. assuming actually believed said engaging pantomime would free consequences.

Well, that's sad (albeit different reasons). wait til go broke hospital bills! thing is, thi k people vaxxed make sure say get breakthrough case get really ill. mention status pretty much guarantee what's Since ivermectin isn’t humans, “overdosing” right word? Isn’t “people TAKING ivermectin”? Hope people taking ivermectin get worst it. majority childhood growing Oklahoma.

May also suggest putting gun shop across street local high school bad idea want cut gunshot wounds...? Hospitals start leaving 10% beds open people actually need deserve them. r/aboringdystopia Sorry idiots need back line  say send back home. Why? shit get high? Look, unlike vaccines, there's definitely conclusive evidence ivermectin works, that's logic behind it. 

I realize easier think people complete idiots, comments like side seems pretty idiotic too. going write comment, least basic google search before... Thanks. want nachos. vaccination rate city? 14% hospitalized may exactly would expect given base rate. favorite ABBA song Deaths seem things idiots care about

they know things worrisome, they're focusing death smallest stat continue minimize seriousness virus political reasons.  sure would shame every one people caught sort plague fucking died.  They'll bankrupt start getting Heartgard instead horse tubes, buy equivalent doses anyway. Meth. cooking meth. Higher Covid rates meaning us vaccinated people let sterilizing immunity decrease FDA dicks around whether recommend boosters really interesting take.

Especially data like coming dramatic change vaccine effectiveness June July likely due emergence delta variant waning immunity time, compounded end masking requirements California resulting greater risk exposure community. findings underline importance rapidly reinstating nonpharmaceutical interventions, indoor masking intensive testing strategies, addition continued efforts increase vaccinations, strategies prevent avoidable illness deaths avoid mass disruptions society spread formidable variant. Furthermore, findings waning immunity verified settings, booster doses may indicated.” Exactly leads steady 3:1 infection ratio. Yet again, ratio change care count.  Lol...I still enjoy them, they're surprisingly optimistic version future apocalypse. cooperating strangers trying protect other! Hollywood puts sugar frosting everything! mean internationally nobody really anything needs anything. We're handling always somebody tries pass laws like this.   Unfortunately, parent balance needs risks. child needs person learning succeed. best thing get vaccinated, send mask get vaccinated available 12 crowd. also gets flu shot every year since baby. 

Believe tell parent ever wants see child hospital, simple keeping home putting bubble. say back line brained dumb asses go… 99% deaths people unvaccinated. almost guaranteed people unvaccinated.

But deaths still tragic. “Good ol cletus. People told Einstein crazy too! Don’t let get you” Cases increasing probably everyone vaccinated removed almost restrictions summer. Deaths low compared population, currently averaging around 30-40 per day population 9 million small. Florida recently peaked around 250 per day population 21 million.

The vaccines effective 100% less 100% people taken it. mean get ahead here, imagine *both*? I'm far bothered countries population choose get matter much want it. never.. Never thought I'd see day nurses got thrown bus Frontline, teachers, children. things grease capitalist machine deaths millions collateral damage. Jesus. Reddit five words…  people sub clearly watch movies. find hard believe would happily plop story front Rogan acolyte know... first I'd like see something little substantive single doctor's claims anecdotal best.

But man, corroborating detail comes out, we're gonna us conversation. Let dumb sort would believe it. taste smell mostly back, every get weird feeling like sinuses super dry cleaned sorta resembles burning smell. I'll random moments everything tastes really bland. 

Had November 2020. even work. studies literally garbage, went them. 
 
There 14 RCT's ivermectin showed effect. I'll take real studies garbage posted. point kinda hope chug much possible.  prioritize gunshot victims guess depends age. March 2020 let kids, especially older ones, see friends make friends going interesting societal experiment. Especially again, look data, risks low.

I see I’m getting downvoted anyone data prove covid actually great risk kids compared day day risks? know see covid data every day don’t see data risks that’s seems scary. Welp.. right lol damn, thankfully Manu deaths cuz vaccines though Yeah, get read reading, think comment's still useful none UK people though.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Sending sympathy Florida. last couple years proven, without shadow doubt, American education system failing teach STEM. basic understanding scientific method 1st year biology wouldn’t bring anyone close expert-level understanding, would least give tools critically wade bs. How’d let get bad??   much, give big hug. Thank you, thank you. people still talk Medicare great despite providing awful coverage purchase supplemental coverage get decent coverage. Medicare doesnt even cover prescription without additional plan thats needs purchased. Never said ACA FABULOUS. 

The ACA best could get given circumstances. 

I still remember people literally denied coverage ACNE, ACA. 

ACA something meant built on. healthcare every country. build previous setups. least 3 months, make appointment ""first"" mRNA dose get it. highly moral, ethical, effective, safe. science backing mixing them? I’m agreeing you. see what’s going happen. Ivermectin binds chloride channel (GluCls), SARS COV2binds ACE2 receptors DPP4. Shit doesn’t add 50% reduction. great odds. 

On planet [**cutting longterm illness mean “not great”? 

We’d moon half Americans healthier year ago. able get shot? thinking thing understandable people feel obligated regardless reason? high risk group

I've struggling interpretation this. know there's varying degrees ""at risk"" individuals i'm sure there's data risk someone would depending health. I'm young, 26 years old, health issues except obesity (working it, 40 pounds far).

So i'm ""immunocompromised"", i'm still ""higher risk"" someone obese, point? Would still risk severe case, hospitalization? interpret it? Use get around it: fair link, Ivermectin shown inhibit replication SARS-CoV-2 cell cultures.13 However, pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic studies suggest **achieving plasma concentrations necessary antiviral efficacy detected vitro would require administration doses 100-fold higher approved use humans.**14,15 American freedom!! Sad. know would lie things pandemic animal adopting vet shortage area. Vets aren’t taking new animals emergency ones booked. People recommending places like 2 hours away emergencies. Yes. ivermectin. I'm glad moved ~~Florida~~ hell. treatment Covid. Nothing staying home taking something fever. even hospital help. virus gets grip you, dead. googled really can't understand *antiparasitic* somehow supposed treat respiratory virus 

From things I've ever seen they're extrapolating possible small vitro anti-viral effects, actually working antiviral body. might show small effects sometimes mean actually miracle cure. I'd bet actual antivirals like Remdisivir Tamiflu could show anti-helminth (parasitic worms) anti-malarial properties vitro too, make good drug deworm treat malaria.  People weren’t given choice lockdown either.   starts again..
Anyone ever wonder news reports like actually cause stockpiling? recommended stick one.

Only US government recommends this; backed science. Hey Mexico ever you?!  Great comeback  herding breeds mutated gene, MDR1, makes intolerant medications. treating dog, vets require testing ensure gene present. Others assume mutation use alternatives. endgame here? govenors get everything spread virus kill citizens along spreading disinformation? get critical point comes back bite ass right? Newbies, get Moderna longer need phone. Hold up. Hear out. let hospital? Natural selection play. Honestly, cares. Republican mean deserve die. hate political I'm tired pandemic call vet ask. Nah. They're stupid that. gotten point might better slapping anyone tries talk you. threatened block trains etc, end 2 guys showed station 😂 Best horse medicine.  might also underlying stupidity American healthcare system wherein get hospitalized really sick, there's good chance life permanently ruined. Meanwhile get ivermectin counter box full average farm supply store last month (also veterinarian prescribe pet heartworm preventative). American headlines ever side affects second pfizer shot....i kinda think worked tho ended getting covid month ago.

Im assuming body didnt react vaccine way made enough antibodies know? hopefully reaction means ull tons feeling subsides within week shot. Yeah. Keep gene pool. Imagine stupid people going future children idiots grow up.  Got first round vax today. hate state live days go by.  basically 9/11 every day Sir, edited comment double length. original comment little content quoted. relevant, absolutely complexity made joke. goes credibility! (Also, don’t believe anything anyone says online based credibility, look things COVID-19 proven one areas. There’s debate, there’s nuance. Ivermectin simply COVID-19 cure.

You must run cutting-edge lab hasn’t published data yet. don’t, I’ll add list lies you’ve posted convo past 10 mins put waiting list. Maybe give people time look FB YouTube treat themselves. Oh wish true. educated, otherwise intelligent people clung shit. akin cult brainwashing think, anyone walk life susceptible to. Case point, Branch Davidians surprisingly diverse group people. number breakthrough infections overstated? 

In US, certainly. narrative turning ""the vaccines really working anymore"" reality like ""the vaccines decrease chance infection factor 5, chance hospitalization infected *additional* factor 3.""

With 150,000 positive tests day 50% population vaccinated, still means ten thousand breakthroughs day. something ""quite common"" yet also whoever accumulating data

Nobody accumulating data US. Government organizations funded this, private entity see profit it. Jesus-freak family. Got witness sibling (who nearly died gallbladder rupture) CORRECT sibling thanked surgeon said, front surgeon, Jesus saved surgery. wanted smack her. Honestly think people protest medicine allowed benefit it.  good child’s mental development two years worth person school canceled. makes feel better we’ve known Mu variant since January. 2000 cases found US far. Fauci said nowhere close dominant.

It shown dodge antibodies. antibodies obtained vaccines still seem effective. Put one huge barn large animal vet see them. Maybe give us answer read article. Well that's good news least, point I'm almost certain I'm going end getting coronavirus point time even though vaccine shots. American headline ever. Throw BigMac coke good measure. That's American headline could imagine level poor scientific understanding US appalling in

cope, people lazy. half daily deaths former peak. death rate still increasing, plateuing?  There's 'correct dosage' humans. *not* human consumption. Seriously may consider editing comment. want depleting stores this.  MS gonna MS fucking sucks. 2nd shot Pfizer February 17th. I'm 6.5 months now, means I'm directly body data shows waning immunity. Everyone else know either Moderna (so immunity lasts longer apparently) got vaccinated months later. girlfriend get fully vaccinated May. 


I also caught COVID January, feel like immune system bit super-charged COVID, I'm also way ahead everyone else's schedules, I'm getting insanely antsy waiting clear instructions come out. I'm trying wait 3rd dose get green light, might find way get it. local hospital system (Mary Washington) mandated staff providers require shots done oct MD/DO/MBBS: 5 years medical school, residency program practice (in US, I’m English doctor feel free correct this) 

Dentist/Podiatrist: oral health training dentists, foot/ankle training podiatrists

Basically, physician trained every area medicine receives additional training one specialties. Using example, 4 years undergrad, 6 years med school, two foundation years neurology training. It’s pretty rare doctors undergrad med school though. Wow, succumbed illness really fast  forever remember Oklahoma Tiger Kind land. mean Mengele.

Also, known treating people *as* animals, opposite denying animal treatment 😂 Yet NIH studying efficacy ivermectin right now, despite established use anti-parasite medicine. dumb? Computer modelling shows ivermectin interfere ability covid dock ACE receptor, vitro studies bear out. certain work vivo. 

So, really dumb try treat active corona virus infection. Yes, patient gotten vaccine. they're infected told sit home wait. Personally, think refused ivermectin penalty refusing vaccine. could see would want try it. Monoclonal antibodies becoming available treatment maybe ivermectin option become increasingly irrelevant unless NIH study shows success. downloading things faster phone recently 🤔 Covid? Straight gulag. Republicans open Russian influence, they're basically annihilating base support here. People fall lies though.  significant difference seen among 30% three symptoms, compared 16% never tested positive, suggesting 32,000 nearly 235,000 infected September March developed long covid also shows kidney issues  vaccine ""dangerous"" That's south. That's also midwest mentioning gunshot victims non big deal? many people getting shot daily Oklahoma? fuck? would expect Venn diagram two types people nearly circle mild breakthru case, tested positive month ago. still dealing guess post viral syndrome w.e.

brain fog, body feels weird time, chest tightness(no breathing issues tho).

it getting better relapsed w.e week ago. im hopin time related thing. Nah. chip vaccine. Covid. like treat idiots? Maybe let wait serious injuries treated first? almost deaths completely preventable. dare read mind like this?Thinking exact thing. Austraila going towards police state i.e new surveillance bill. Idiots &amp; police state mix smh remember conservatives disagreed whether government that. lot seem disagree whether they're farm animals. get bonus cough, shit little time! founder recovery. people overdosing farm animal drugs honestly ones left untreated case course, definitely think comment needed whole heartedly agree you. also want add Im militant atheist dont ""hate"" religion means, think people (such yourself) actually understand religion really means individual. like said personal you. went catholic school raised catholic household (loosely lol). always confused teachings Jesus never followed believed faith. like Jesus great person, didnt judge, didnt persecute, literally accepted everyone treated everyone respect, honesty love. reason like people want like God old testament Jesus (who God literally sent show people be?) 

 dont think religion identity way thinking life. people like you. think matter believe, long good person, moral ethically, thats matters. Whatever decide believe important (i dont mean disrespectfully generally).

People take religion like identity someone disgrees another perspective launch combat mode becomes ""I'm right wrong God said so"". feel like somewhere along lines religion manipulated past point God would intended. makes sense? 

All Im sorry rambling, fully agree practice. people could practice like think would better world. end matter believe in, eachother. need help protect eachother, treat eachother kindess love..no one person inheritantly better other. I'd like think God would surely agree right sentiment. 

Also really appreciate comment! Thanks perspective:) article informative. claim gunshot victims wait based Dr. McElyea said news interview. would bet ""gunshot victims"" intended specific sense, people need ambulance visit ER, kind thing might associate gunshot victim also car accident on, wait beds become available. Thanks putting perspective DuhSantis blood ego! terrible research paper. vital variables uncontrolled unobserved. believe published reputable, peer-review journal. well intended bad science. even believable Republicans Oklahoma dumb they’d ignore advice every doctor planet start taking horse de-worming drugs, overdosing point blindness. 

And yet are… 6K today...  both?

*My god may able beat thing!* Agreed. unpleasant side effects first dose. definitely get third shot, can’t say I’m thrilled it. I’m extremely frustrated anti-vaxers, think it’s important honest transparent side effects. failed all, that, sorry. Damn, missed opportunity.  Yea, vaccination mandatory law UK things like measles that's falls apart. State level mandated vaccines line crossed.

If private businesses overwhelmingly decline serve that's choice. fucking bullshit. 

Those idiots back line. taking precious resources away people actually need deserve it. take horse dewormer: need bolt eyes trip glue factory. Yeah obviously medieval castle kennel master essentially vet. royal dumbass cracks neck. thanks :) I’m trying understand think individual. let anyone whatever want despite actual potential consequences others. 

We general think there’s right drive drunk. think there’s right drive speed want wherever want. even go far mandate insurance, seatbelt helmet laws, traffic laws. Why? you’re vaccinated risk statistically negligible life little laid back times? benefiting someone else work longer harder? long work getting done. Precedent important also able evaluate individual circumstances. already drawn boundaries limits personal choice comes negatively effecting greater good. certainly lives edge, government mandated vaccine mandating children without cognitive dissonance. things, choose point sliding scale personal choice vs. greater good. Frankly, understand perspectives waffle back forth.  


I'm opinion long vaccinated surviving rates equivalent better flu, anyone chooses vaccinated pays significantly higher health insurance premium. Choices consequences choice vaccinated directly leads greater health care costs &amp; flooded hospitals. making choice need ones pay it. know really come lab China right? Like, almost impossible know now. walk cvs Walgreens get it. won’t make prove immunocompromised status. vaccines would go waste anyway. think I’d prioritizing gun shot victims since I’m assuming ailments weren’t self inflicted…. taste smell back, certain smells forever off. Coffee, coke, peppers smell taste wrong. Garbage always smells same, kinda like rotten jalapeños. Idk I’ll ever fully recover complete sense smell. February 2021. need prioritize people self inflicted wounds due stupidity wrong, little complex that. Many people confident enough plumbing work themselves, matter simple. basic $30 bidet runs water toilet's supply going miserable experience many, especially cold climates. Ultimately, people, cost getting bidet would actually enjoy using likely run hundred them, that's unfortunately big piece slowing adoption. bright side though, sales bidet attachments US go last year, seems people seeing need. article isn’t much better. Ambulances can’t unload patients ambulances go calls. Apparently CDC looking ivermectin actually used treat covid. doctor interviewed said people taking inappropriate amounts ivermectin (isn’t amount much since it’s made livestock?). 

This bingo card year.  pleased see Dr. Ghandi list, she’s reasonable steady head doctors prioritizing idiots self inflicted conditions others? 

sorry idiot bystander got shot robbery, I'll come back check self poisoning save someone themselves. still make political. did. That’s appalling. incredibly hard wearing mask?

Of course throw away new card. want antivaxer get hands it. tp paper towels last two times went costco It’s Oklahoma, anybody surprised?  Yeah, least homeopathists would give harmless placebo. Clinical trials, existed time, would shown homeopathy superior treatments actively kill you. think possible say contagious might sick testing positive yet, might sick. Personally I'd assume I'm sick case rapid test 2-3 days safe.  would truly horrific path on. would make winter death tolls look like picnic. Well....you'd surprised. Im psychic. seem like dick agree disagree. point subjectively sound want governed government mandates vaccines even I've vaccine itself. sit well bigger picture. line crossed me.  morons COVIDIOTS given least priority. put meme format bet goes viral Yeah I’m funeral I’m always looking watch. S/ 

Kinda like Trump 2 scoops ice cream dumping fish food fish. side effects first two times? Vaccines mandates necessary protect people themselves. protect around them. Pssh it’s hoax also chinese made  bought bidet. I'm caught pants (figuratively literally) time goddammit Especially since scholarly study showing efficacy, it’s publication retracted due plagiarism falsifying data. study still referenced thousands vaccine denial websites first Google search result page. see used *constantly* forums defense Ivermectin regard truth. would black magic sir! 
Happy Cake day! limits body autonomy? include strapping bomb chest, getting bus, detonating it?

Or could kinds limitations? Heartgard requires prescription state thank God got reference. True redditor right lol makes angry. got vaccinated soon could fully vaxxed two months. I'm responsible, get money? hundred bucks probably seem like much people poor student, could feed month. Round 3 almost upon us, heard cross Vax talk Bill Gates directly. *chefs_kiss.jpg* Abbott would spin ""creating job openings."" definitely priority. Maintaining suppression without high long-term cost requires nearly 100% vaccination. countries pursued complete suppression point largely negligent vaccination. Meanwhile countries larger earlier waves high enough vaccination seen cases decline toward zero (though know time sustainable).

In short term, border control countries much higher prevalence fairly profitable. That’s they’re asking. 

Statistically, 98% deaths unvaccinated people. unvaccinated tend lean right, Republican lawmakers pundits done hell lot work pushing anti-vaccine anti-mask lies throughout entire ordeal.

It’s perfectly reasonable ask actions contributing death voters. post somewhat rhetorical worked hospital know process works, still think it’s dumb even give people care (that goes unvaccinated people decide partake risky behavior) understand doctors took oath discrimination I’m reading stories people dying bc couldn’t get gallbladder removed receive cancer treatment think pick one live… hipsters covid-18 sold went mainstream? say neigh. completely agree you. People vaccine skeptical problem ingesting farm grade horse paste complete dumbasses logically inconsistent. hate people push far direction act like ivermectin solely used horse dewormer potential adjunct comes treating covid. jury still research needed determining it’s either ineffective potential treatment. definitely understand you’re coming though, people act like it’s secret covid cure government suppressing completely insane.  anymore. exact colloquial use causes trademarks invalidated. horse paste brigade accidentally taking corpos maybe Republicans make giant fucking deal tiniest infraction Democrat know base eat up, meanwhile ignore shit side does. 

No one care Biden looked watch twice solemn event, like one care Obama put Dijon burger. lie things, literally said ""they minor matter"" wanted talk actually important things. try make dumb gotchas headlines. Oh Darwin, Oh Darwin, Oh Daaaarwin clementine. feel like prioritized. sayin. prioritizing incorrectly. Invermectin patients last. Scientists. know, people developed vaccines.

The vaccines idiots refuse take first place. one hand, want believe this. other, *100%* believe dumb enough come own. guy's cat president!!! seen horsey sauce cause much damage healthcare system since last time Arby's gave away free sandwiches. gonna say lol Black socialist, apparently. surprised race close considering inflammatory crap flung Andrew Gillum’s way DeSantis’s camp GOP general. Back alley-ish got Pfizer vaccine, download half fast Modernites can. Wow, get vaccine OK? Nobody bind chair force ap needle you.

But, strong incentives. example kids would accepted kindergarten lacked measles shot. vaccines good society well person. person care society, society right ""offended"".  original Unsee Juice™, paste form! one things involves ER though?

Do trans people really tough time getting HRT? 1000s websites prescribe mail ever fucking hormones/steroids want you. get bloodwork done, results bloodwork even matter. like medical marijuana cards. Instead of, ""I back pain"", it's, ""I'm lethargic"".  

I cis man, legitimate medical need anabolic steroids (I opted it, took peptides bought online instead. worked well, muscle tissue never recover take gear.), doctors afraid prescribe me. think anyone able get hormones easily doctor. countries freedom seen something good, sure. 

Truth huge crisis relieved lot enough people get vaccinated. health situation certain countries keeps getting worse, health care systems collapsing, mandating vaccine absolutely table. crazy Try American going life saying “what actual fuck” every day ask stupid question. insured Americans send children hospital treatment lower threshold sickness Europe. expect obesity, diet sedentary lifestyle plays part wonder different hospital admission criteria well. Thiss rhetorical anything. understand triage acuity someone might already process treatment gun shot victim comes in. fricken stupid hospital resources going to. It’s also feel bunch Covid people taking beds bc won’t get vaccinated people dying things like getting gallbladder surgery time. understand doctors took oath, also think hear people don’t deserve care others. kind feel like gunshots get priority cuz that's probably self-inflicted. highly less likely shot someone else gave horse medicine He’s hospital she’s probably scolding him. He’s clearly idiot doesn’t listen smart advice. I’m sure there’s sitcom too. show ER overdosed wrong, CDC made sick try prove wrong!

So one answer. Young kids still need 'baby-sitter' systems. Teens older need discipline, often self discipline teachers really allowed instill students anyway.

Even further, whether virtual brick mortar, students held age learning ability (fast slow). grouping lessons designed working environements age grouping would pccur 'naturally' preferably competence.

Just like first system overwhelmed you’re fucked. Organ transplants actually really good metaphor lists basically always completely overwhelmed. there’s 10 extra kidneys give suddenly chances go way way up. Similarly hospital open beds need treatment you’re bit screwed

You cannot compare US UK. believe probably good idea US teens vaxxed. UK ones. make much news without piece info.

The important thing take away educators dying unnecessarily already severe educator shortage US. fighting mask ban Florida important keeping kids home would smarter choice.  think somewhat first come first serve. hospital fills dumbasses taking horse pills unvaxxed covid patients, there's beds available can't kick take new patients.

Now, lot people think Tractor Supply way get leave doctors conversation. reasons think ivermectin might work prophylactic, need studies.

IMO makes way sense get vaccine, it’s simple “Horse dewormer self-described dumbass ufc announcer says gud?”  Healthcare workers retail workers get paid enough.

That said, chiropractic care scientific evidence back claim boost immune function, mean effective treatment back pain. defend practice saying Nobel Prize medication, essential things, ask produce data used treat viral infections like COVID, produce nothing change everything attacks, calling troll liar.

I even dissected ""documents"" pointing says document assumption work, nothing tested

I challenge anti vaxxer reading this, provide evidence medication works viral infections, provide documents data, peer reviewed data... course, that’s said *in experience* - two people think advocate returning office lots small kids home constantly exhausted. they'll ""research""

Yeah, tear meniscus definitely want see doctor, can’t physical therapy away. knee hurts it’s problem joint ligament, that’s PT (and fitness years, far often it’s problem joint/ligament).

TLDR: end deleting comment step 1 2 God dammit stuck head!  exactly doing. It’s actuary science. Play odds majority kids won’t get really sick. one gap parents might vaccinated. would anyone want to? took beautiful land turned dust bowls parking lots.  sure - personally, I'm still wondering whether go back wearing masks. might booster comes out. Saved click. retailer specify items might see limits amount customers purchase per trip. Ultimately shit say betrays astonishing fragility insecurity. also medicineless livestock principle agree you. people drain hospital system purposefully put position.

However, families would sue shit hospitals treating sick. Dr's nurses (most all) want help people get better. feel terrible people working hospitals crowds anti-vaxers shouting them. Typical Darwin Wanting break family doesn’t mean hate them.

And everyone lives family. people live alone enjoy social interaction office.  Even worse. They'll ignore recommendations medical professionals get vaccine that's proven safe effective. Instead they'll ""research"" online decide take Ivermectin substances. become violently ill overdosing substances they'll go running medical professionals ignored first place.

If trust medical professionals comes COVID going running trusting help self-inflicted overdoses? going back Facebook ""researching"" symptoms like ""researched"" Ivermectin, etc. everyone masked? Seems like lot breakthrough cases people getting exposed maskless situations. Fauci stated Americans require 3 shots become fully immuized....really, really convoluted messaging coming administration IQ walnut.

God bless USA sure, subreddit doesn’t allow personal anecdote loss smell common. Still there’s much past getting people vaccine, virus endemic it’s projected everyone get it. Improving health preventing future pandemics seems like logical next step me. pay vet rates!? might think Israel vaccinated country, I've heard little half vaccinated. add that, R0 Delta seems twice original strain. combine two facts, get expect similar cases deaths Delta vaccines, without vaccines would complete nightmare far, far worse.

Think like this: average originally every person infected would infected 3 people. Now, every person infected would infected 6 people, 3 vaccinated. mean...Australia basically Texas different accent. 80% 53% vaccinated now. ride out

This thinking bizarre me. reminds March 2020's magical thinking warm weather making everything disappear. 

Hospital system administrators stupid. know people getting vaxxed droves. know going away 6 months. pay traveling nurses $500k know demands pay equity current employees, that's going spread similarly situated positions. pay equity going balloon. 

I'm absolutely *not* arguing nurses worth. PTSD-inducing nightmare fuel there. want know endgame collapsing hospitals bidding war actually going keep hospitals staffed collapse. makes glad go med school, lol. Imagine working hard training knowledge: biochem, cell biology, anatomy physiology, knowing thousands drugs, details every organ human body works, participating difficult surgeries, staying day night save people's lives, seeing medical training learned put use WORK.

And guy comes see coughing, COVID+, high fever, low blood ox, saying get vax want deworming agent someone said could work. hurt. thinking hospitals part problem.

Until get sick themselves. part solution. McMaster never going give shit hold breath. I'm sorry deal this. It’s flat, it’s dropping sharply. data often vaccinated people get tested positivity rate vs. unvaccinated?

I always see people say cases among vaccinated people low stopped getting tested, among people still unvaccinated, many care enough actually get tested (which often costs money) considering even get free highly effective shot? Well, also shop new dentist aren’t happy COVID protocols. Spoiler Alert: doctors.

No excuse neglect medical care. virus preys people neglect unable get quality medical care… yes, dental health medical care. (not all) people pushing office return picnics. people good office politics want go back power.

This big problem general. *Ideally* kids always stay home school they're ill, parents work. gave one care can't afford lose day two wages? Choices may limited... original point (this merely theater) stands? Thanks. link source, seem recall Novavax study said something similar. daughter's school ""encouraging"" masks almost one wears one, including teachers, wearing example students. class currently quarantining home. daughter kid class wore mask COVID anyway.

It exists within capitalism like many things like instance chiropractic True worms brain never along way One thing watch boosters confirmed yet, apparently White House got ahead FDA, currently seems dismissive boosters. people fine lying get boosters, think quite understandable, fine that, aware guarantee we'll allowed boosters then, though think likely. Also, boosters take couple weeks kick in, want make sure get early November. live Deep South city none. nearest place well sixty miles away according local news twenty slots filled within moments opening. Indeed. health professionals two doses enough. protect serious disease get breakthrough infection infection act booster you. John Campbell made point British health authorities seems make sense. course boosters elderly could best move younger people point it’s likely encounter covid, relatively protected without need hospitalization get longer immunity post infection. important looking push false narrative vaccine inefficacy, drive sensationalist click based journalism.

Edit: far, fat.  Nobody wears mask around even there's sign business. Well, almost nobody. sure cases much higher reported. They're mostly listening parents taking opportunity school.

Kids walking classes protest mask mandates too. would like vaccine isn’t eligible risk server covid complications. see children risk populations. Though seeing worrying amount RSV cases covid also appearing tandem. RSV generally spikes winter summer spike caught people guard.

And really steps take post vaccination people begin working improving health. Sure can’t go Obese normal weight day, take small steps every day get country healthier. really hope next public health message encourages healthy diets lifestyles, shall see. got relatively quickly couple still dealing lingering effects. I'm arguing they're dying it, pointing vaccinated people still catch spread virus, largely countries trying avoid.

Critically, early studies many point order justify ivermectin's use COVID-19 patients conducted *in vitro* (i.e., cells dish), *in vivo* (in animal models human beings). exceedingly common, host reasons, drugs display therapeutic effect *in vitro* *in vivo*. got note Dr. Pepper saying need mask!

/s Israel ""the largest Covid outbreak world"". Israel largest number diagnosed new cases, due high number daily tests relative size population. 
For example — Israel currently \~2x daily diagnosed cases US, 4x tests. % positive tests also significantly lower Israel many countries.  


Israel large COVID outbreak, almost certainly far largest world.  


Also worth noting despite number cases, Israel's number severely ill patients currently decreasing. Seek find definitely valid concern sure lost faith future US result covid related behavior. suppose testament poor US education system is.

I imagine physicians must feel. People reject years, decades even medical training experience, support wild claims made politicians, medical scientific training all. not. go medical school trained narrow specialty. much evidence based chiropractic, still physicians. good players league several years make good money. lot best players team control 6 seasons make significantly market value seasons. Take Mike Trout, excellent started. first three full seasons, finished first second place MVP voting every year made combined $2 million three years. made significantly market value next three years well able sign contract paid worth.

It's egregious minor leagues. players get huge bonuses getting drafted scrape peanuts. probably true minor league teams make much money, major league teams they're associated benefit immensely minor league system place.  reinfections still extremely uncommon. Israel asymptomatic reinfections we’re 13 times less common compared breakthrough fully vaccinated (Pfizer) 27x less likely symptomatic reinfection. 

But you’re correct heard immunity doesn’t seem possible according UK public health officials. Keep good work trunts! cost issue? ""I'm gonna take FDA approved vaccine! wanna take horse dewormer proven anything.""

Why people like exist? Also lax gun laws Also there's 613 commandments, 10 (at least per jews) Holy shit. Like we're looking tangible benefits anti-parasitic drugs eat like 1/4 cup pumpkin seeds daily week.

It several benefits ivermectin. 

1:) Tastes better

2:) gonna kill vast majority parasites dosage level

3:) put salad trail mix nobody gonna look funny

4:) gonna sent hospital unless eating multiple pounds

5:) grind make taco sauce them

6:) getting outside fresh pumpkins turn fresh pumpkin pie fry strips pumpkin put tacos salad One college towns shut down, setting overflow tents hospitals declared state emergency. Things looking pretty bad. They're still going hold football giant stadium filled people. Facts harder fears fiction.

For example fears part, vaccine hesitant person hears J&amp;J vaccine myocarditis issue, they're likely entrench fears. minimum amount information overturn fears would include (1) mostly limited young men, (2) occurs 1 every 10,000 patients, (3) similar symptoms occur 1 every 4 COVID patients. read parts two pretty crunchy technical papers find information. *illegal*. law it. agree statements, you’ll need establish causal link least. mean hypothesize engine oil impregnate woman run tests see it’s true not, even can’t establish logical hypothesis first place. see anywhere explain ivermectin interfere help viral infection even begin Well least worms.  Hospitalisations main data need. really true? seems weird, even 2020-21. 80% normally distributed across US. Lower places like Mississippi places like NYC vaccinated cases.  pandemic truly showed us numbers psychopaths sociopaths US way underestimated. many people self-empathy. Rules triage put people last. place near asks see carry it? Keep somewhere safe home case end needing something future.  mind us... natural selection get us sorted out. shit probably blessing disguise. may/June would 1000 downvotes comment it’s truth. Reddit odd place veterinarians done you? Even Fauci pro booster.

Giving boosters want USA doesn’t preclude shipping doses overseas, never hit vaccination rates Denmark Portugal. 

Meanwhile, Pfizer J&amp;J recipients watching immunity Covid infection decline. Acknowledging people want get boosters would seem like sane policy. Maybe give 1 month they’re restricted healthcare workers/elderly addition immune compromised open US boosters anyone wants one. Freedom!  They’re lot similar 11x death rate proposed earlier comment. So, yes, relative terms context, they’re similar. 

I’ll also point vaccination rate lower vast majority people clogging ICU’s dying unvaccinated. course numbers higher less immunity. That’s common sense.

Edit:

I’d also like point understanding metric antithetical comments making sense numbers worse. 

It makes perfect sense think understand why. 

Unvaccinated people. I... can't begin wrap head around this.

And difference you. Enjoy it...kinda course oral vs. topical dramatic difference. thought clear enough mentioned cream rosacea, skin condition, edited post make clearer. use cream daily, routine part life, never hurts extra clear, can't assume average reader familiarity disease do.

Best regards. sounds like Oklahoma got gun problem well US nutshell feel kids trying safe end bringing COVID home parent grandparent. many parents children stuck rock hard place right going two years.  antivaxxers protesting medicine? clearly think vaccines bad. moronic minds tell things medical bad?  I've seen one-in-seven adults. study 4.4% 4 weeks 1.8% 8 weeks
 really arent. People done sensationalized version reality based actually America people overdosing get shot, take place line?  feel sorry comedians point. beat headlines like this? Republican headline, let's clear stupid exists. Theres something fucked state Florida greater population percentage fully vaccinated do. Friday, 13 districts representing half Florida’s 2.8 million public school students imposed mask mandates despite governor’s order parental opt-out must included. Meanwhile, Joe Biden blamed surge Delta variant Covid-19 among US remain unvaccinated disappointing August job creation figures. Rochelle Walensky, director CDC, said Thursday new research due made public Friday showed hospitalizations children four times higher states low vaccination rates month August, USA Today reported . 17-18 year olds? ones get vaccinated (in US anyway) capacity online school? 7-8 year olds? handled?. Big difference though. Gunshot victims participating gang shootouts aren’t overwhelming emergency rooms. Idiots taking horse medicine are. stupid? Sure. bottom triage list? Sure. putting one gang participant gunshot victim bottom going solve problem? No. There’s literally picture horse box.  I’m fully vaccinated wearing mask. I’ve seen people wearing nothing like months ago. believe CDC encouraging even vaccinated people wear masks high transmission areas. think it’s tough ask since summer mask free.

It’s bad here. local schools closed due positive cases UK Deaths (per million last 7 days): 10.11
 US Deaths (per million last 7 days): 20.96

so double amount deaths. ""have similar numbers"" currently bill instead? keep incentivizing things dangerously stupid?  Cant get Rona already dead! risk/reward pretty tight 30's, surprise kids.

Every decision far JCVI vaccines correct, reason think correct, again. nothing chiropractor PT/DPT cannot. anything, chiro's approach dangerous effective. cracking selling point stupid love throwing would subluxations catchy phrase.   ""Uh... came Ivermectin poisoning.""

""Yes. And?""

""Why'd notch ear?""

""Oh, here, let get pamphlet.""

""Also undies are... fitting bit... more...""

""Yes, go, 'So neutered like cat.'"" treat gunshot victims first let natural selection play bit here. ivory tower CDC types probably able live lives via Zoom large comfortable homes. don’t give damn normalcy.

I booster dose scheduled 6 month mark already. ""rugged individualism"" goes wrong What?! Horsey sauce amazing, esp fries! So, don’t want come across asshole, sure will, especially comes personal know science works definitely placebo effect. I've also changed I've sat, use different chair.

This right here, tells don’t understand science, don’t understand placebo effect. cannot judge placebo effect yourself. requires double-blind study nature.

Now, interested really understanding, two things offer.

First, familiarize history Chiro: it, really is.

Second, truly important. Find copy **The Demon-Haunted World: Science Candle Dark**. Read chapter titled *The Fine Art Baloney Detection*. want, read chapter titled *The Dragon Garage*. Don’t read chapters unless really book. two important long.

They tell science really is, use purposes.

However, warn advance, really understand chapters likely trigger cognitive dissonance really screw view world while. know read chapters suddenly realized bunch mysticism interested complete BS. Goodness gracious no, thank asking. I've heard people genuniely can't wear masks due claustrophobia, PTSD rather specific trigger (resulting things like one's mouth covered assaulted), autism-related sensory issues. suspect they're ones getting notes chiropractors, many would willing try something like plastic face shields.

Also, know guy *has* wear mask due medical issues -- can't afford get kind respiratory ailment right now. Anti-maskers making life extra miserable. Yeah, part issue studies promising results still up. really consider problem except ones known issues (and apparently retracted), people going look every study see valid people idea research works (which honestly fair). people really questioning scientific community see positive studies carrying much weight ones ambivalent negative results though.

However, still think people endangering ivermectin reading studies. least people vocal proponents online probably did, qualified disseminate sort information. People would actually find dosing info studies. again, lots people can't basic math either.

The way see it: using ivermectin treat covid itself, prophylactic treatment, experimental use drug. approved used way, stronger clinical trials support using way. Using FDA approved Pfizer shot drastically effective per research (and free), also *not* experimental. honestly make sense use ivermectin eligible medically able receive vaccine. virtual hospitalization? triaging idiots first people? curious. UK masks schools? like US it’s sporadic, mandates, optional? It’s right smarter everyone else anything pandemic showed us quickly people grow fatigued even trivial public health measures, exposed folly personal choice. people failed us—the government stop fucking around treat like emergency is. slugs. Im 100% someone may contridict here, MPs could go committee. However committe said considered health benefits kids themselves, wider benefits. leaves wiggle room case government wants it. ""It's horse dewormer! Sure people taking horse dewormer.""

They're taking horse dewormer, appropriate call horse dewormer, like would took horse tylenol. r/nottheonion    Look brighter side things..........

Seriously, another fucking world. shit happening everywhere, insane places. Tell live USA without telling live USA  thinking Chiropractor even par researcher, MD/DO made first blatant mistake.

Although reading article says said government consider wider aspects like disruption education etc. “The Centers Disease Control Prevention released health advisory last week warning people could become severely ill self-medicating ivermectin overdosing could cause coma, seizures, death.

I understand large number adults seem think won’t get covid minor inconvenience. Especially since obvious year isn’t true. Yeah unfortunate. super busy even without aspect though. Vet techs get paid much difficult work do, lot people stay long - believe somewhat common people work vet tech, quit train become nurse instead (weirdly somehow) less demanding importantly pays waaay better.

I know US, Canada least vets taking lot health precautions, limiting # people come in, drop-off door, etc etc. imagine impact many patients see day too.  contact tracing done Tennessee? Saturday’s definitely super spreader events drenched Big Orange disappointment. Except pediatric hospitalizations keep rising. article lines data reading 3 weeks ago showed Delta variant vaused percentage children adolescents hospitalized die previous variants. However, spreading much among 0-9 10-19 age demographics cumulative number hospitalizations age ranges going significantly. important pediatric ICU beds abundant many places. lot data prior School years starting. many places Schools starting without mask requirements social distancing. 

I guess concern is, parent two children old enough vaccinated, want optimistic, information like often take context used reason use mitigation tools, like wearing masks, think things important kids Vaccinated. Memphis, fair started today.  always case pretend taken Ivermectin get spayed? makes ivermectin buy stock? Last year time, central FL midst holiday season covid boom.

Vaccinations lessen boom year. Delta changed game. personally expect hospitals overloaded now.

But... fully vaxxed + boosters + N95/KN95 + comorbidities + social distancing? Well seems like lowish risk.

If arent that, personally would reconsider risk tolerance low.  It’s going happen. child wear mask, hopefully lower viral load they’ll inevitably exposed to. Thanks this. know mine rhetorical question. Still amazes concerns quickly resolved sincere google search Yeah, I've experienced word chosen absolutely falls short conveying feeling.

No, system “ensure they’ll get Covid. Pray it’s mild”.

Which individual choice outrageous: Covid (even Delta version) statistically threatening kids. risk unvaccinated kids vaccinated parents, much lower risk unvaccinated grandparents. Many things society (e.g. cars) much threatening children.

As social policy it’s pretty terrible though. whole lot kids going get sick going die, kids going spread disease families kill grandparents, communities didn’t get vaccinated won’t take basic cheap simple precautions.  5yr old starts Tuesday I'm bracing inevitable.  mistake probably trying reason people positions reason way first place. Can't say lot parents brought kids world without concern whether right time lives whether would able properly care kids.

There's gigantic overlap education MDs DOs. 4 years med school include 2 preclinical years (classic education lectures tests) subjects like anatomy, pharmacology, biochemistry, etc., followed 2 clinical years rotate different specialities (e.g. Internal Medicine, Surgery, Ob/Gyn, etc.). medical school, residency speciality choice. residency level, MDs DOs often program difference two becomes less apparent.

In terms differences, major one DOs learn osteopathic manipulation treatment (OMT) addition standard medical education. involves movement patient's body diagnosis treatment illnesses. much less backed clinical data closer realm pseudoscience (and ironically enough, similar chiropractors do). Many DOs view OMT way practice though swear it. Admittedly, I'm MD opinion may somewhat biased. Additionally terms differences, DOs set board exams though many sit MD boards well residencies look favorably upon scores. Finally, entrance requirements little lenient DOs, lower undergrad GPAs MCAT (admissions test) scores needed.

Hope answer helpful!  Both'll clean ya know people keep bringing number pediatric flu deaths flu seasons preceded pandemic. literally one recorded pediatric flu death US 2020/2021 flu season due mask mandates schools mostly online Yeah know either. thing think areas getting pummeled high enough immunity. Plus clearly demonstrated vaccinated people spread Covid, never knowing contractd it. mild infection, likey spreading days isolated.

Maybe angry, live Texas point pandemic, 4 people know died summer due others' irresponsibility. war vaccinated unvaccinated, since unvaccinated hurting us responsible, maybe deserve medical treatment responsible. That’s vigilance, it’s social norm, there’s difference. Vigilance = fear response.

Vietnam doesnt really use peak prediction, except old HCMC pandemic response team got fired last week. widespread community spread happened (as case HCMC southern provinces), peak prediction, used non-Zero-Covid countries old HCMC pandemic response team, based either idiotic herd immunity strategy (which Vietnam never used) equally idiotic expectation virus somehow mutate less lethal (when that's natural selection works all). such, Vietnam, ""prediction"" spread reach ""peak"" combined strategies vaccination (at least 80% population) lockdown slow eventually stop spread. now, 2 districts HCMC, epicenter country cases come from, managed so. less question vaccine comes anything else. Bonus points person says, ""They want know this, . . ."" conservatives love ""owning"" ""facts"". Stay classy, Oklahoma go matinee? weekday? live TN shocking all. knew relaxed restrictions never coming back. TN continue path virus runs course kills hit kills.

My daughter currently suffering COVID 8 years old. I'm traveling work poor wife trying take care daughter also keeping 5-year-old son getting it.

It's really fucked going schools. Basically, county's school administrators put heart-felt request everyone wear masks also said can't force anyone Governor holding funding hostage. also turns contact tracing garbage. got letter Wednesday saying ""we positive case buiding. close contact contacted"" later learned positive case daughter's class. daughter started showing symptoms Saturday morning. got positive result Sunday contacted school. 6 hours later notified 6 positive cases reported building. classroom. positive case elementary classroom, everyone close contact. WTF?

My anger comes losing loved ones covid. One lived India vaccine largely available summer people America appreciating available vaccine medical ""professionals"" tampering it. One person vaccinated, trusted adult son also vaccinated eased wearing mask, son hosting maskless parties, anti-vax infected whole family, including toddler pregnant wife. 

I'm sure many others similar stories, please excuse lack patience people yet take vaccine. Again, mean attack you, can't help angry us facing consequences actions people share beliefs taken. fuckin' Jealous... much complicated this.

First, 80% immunity adults. Much population children ineligible vaccination.

Second, 85% assumes R0=7 (probably good assumption) vaccine effectiveness/effectiveness previous infection spreading disease 100% (probably bad assumption).

If take vaccine previous infection reduce spread 80%, get new herd immunity threshold 85%/80% = 106%.

""Herd immunity"" going happen, like happened for, e.g. common cold.

However, everyone vaccinated and/or infected, longer threat hospital system. understand republicans keep trying kill supporters.  Vancouver mayor flat called people idiots! Virus can't survive host dead 🤷‍♀️ mean that's pretty much everywhere. Hell Kroger's Walmart's area say mask required even vaccinated half walking around mask.

[Excerpt Singapore read article, know discovered Colombia. learned anything spread airborne viruses last 18 months, know really matter. United States America(USA), need look curbing COVID-19 Pandemic realistic way getting vaccinated COVID-19. honestly see, most, 65 percent USA getting fully vaccinated COVID-19, still enough reach form ""Herd Immunity"". Perhaps combination vaccinated people, *and* people infected COVID-19 way essentially full control pandemic? 

This woman know anti-vaxxer, we've never gotten along-even pandemic. advocate Facebook get vaccinated COVID-19, went tirade. libeled name Facebook, saying I'm ""self-proclaimed incel"", painting ""perverted freak"". Granted, admit perverted creep high school(I'm open used be), asinine assume high school I'm almost 31 years old. I've also never claimed ""incel"", also accusing making one stupid ""Missed Connections"" Craigslist posts. blocked years ago made lie posing another guy Formspring, still immature, dishonest, even though almost age me.

**All said I'm vocal getting vaccinated**(which fully admit am). fully admit I've pushy prick vaccine. literally lie, try damage reputation goes show anti-vaxxing movement turned dangerous, disgusting cult. us don’t want homes become offices 100% time forever?  Like Joe Rogan.  think we're beyond minimizing spread. advocate much possible minimize spread we're point going stop epidemic. need mitigation processes place (masking, good air flow etc), adults choice get vaxed - US anyway.  tons kids home POSSIBLE spread little symptoms good anyone, hopefully everyone knows kid life, get vaxed get point. ……..no? I’m saying that’s field chiropractics based on?  Huh? Plenty kids school last year? also still catch covid like us. think parents get kids weren’t? wasn’t spread kids?  It’s bummer summer second half happening? someone explain happens  fucking psychotic Alcoholics likely need liver transplant. 

The general rule alcoholics (I think) dry year becoming eligible transplant.

Cause one study showing reduce 10% want ignore others say same. fine. want hold opinion impressed surgical mask numbers, you. pretend work bold faced lie. school resumes rest UK, seems fair expect cases start rise quicker deaths (sort like scenario months ago people saying link cases deaths broken)

This wrong now. CFR UK 0.2%, vaccinated 95% elderly nearly nobody 20. CFR going drop further. cases double, deaths also double.

Of course, deaths trail infections month so, that's mean ""quicker"".

You quite clearly see scenario months ago. Cases deaths increased 15-fold since then.  lib feel totally owned.

*snerk* parents horse human? tbh, would go immediately shot, since side effects tend show hours later morning after, especially soreness headache/congestion. Vigorous exercise worsen symptoms shot.

Damn it, I've said many times, stupid lost meaning. Better go stupid ER. thought covid real like flu? would someone want meds treat something real? Im confused. know long breakthrough infections last average? vaccinated individuals overcome sickness quicker non-vaccinated? No, stupid. outliers sure, average would venture people stupider.  thanks holding line.  Glad see South Carolina longer #1. course, we're much better situation. Vaccinations climbing, slowly. made vaccine apple flavoured. Cocaine one hell drug.    It’s mind boggling White House made announcement/recommendation without implicit assurance timelines scope fda/cdc.

It’s equally mind boggling fda, cdc, respective advisory panels don’t see writing wall want potentially months early boosters rather risk months late. Anti vaxxers mad parent know many kids Covid. risk children exceptionally low. risk posed vaccine also exceptionally low. they’ve looked experts determined widescale roll across age group isn’t necessary/ advisable.

Also, don’t forget U.K. contending delta variant sometime. say charge eligible non-vaxed people 5 times going rate treatment. Also raise insurance premiums wells ban non essential businesses. keep ethics part tact maybe provide incentive idiots go get vaccine literally made salt, sugar, lipids (fats) partial mRNA strand solely create spike protein virus. feel guilty.

This country wasted MILLIONS doses idiots would rather drink bleach take equine medicine. 

Protecting best ability best thing around you.  Agencies take data reach different conclusions.

It’s like rewarding bad behavior. data schools closed children weren’t really interacting, it’s also delta variant really took hold.  least idiocy fatal not.

There zero logical case ivermectin. Sure study want. one ignorant they're vaccine hesitant taking ivermectin, they're walking contradiction. believe Ivermectin, studies conducted proven shady well. whole pick choose thing, hypocrisy getting me. wonder we’ll ever get statistics many people die kind issues. many hospitals push back treating emergency cases they’re full Covid cases and/or idiots trying Facebook remedies undoubtedly lot deaths necessary.

This part’s important: **Typically, clinicians consider one diagnostic hypothesis possibility explanation patient's symptoms refine list information obtained diagnostic working diagnosis shared patient, including explanation degree uncertainty associated working diagnosis. time revision working diagnosis, information communicated patient. 

This part key: **As diagnostic process proceeds**, fairly broad list potential diagnoses may narrowed fewer potential options, process referred diagnostic modification refinement (Kassirer et al., 2010). **As list becomes narrowed one two possibilities**, diagnostic refinement working diagnosis becomes diagnostic verification, lead diagnosis checked adequacy explaining signs symptoms, coherency patient's context (physiology, risk factors), whether single diagnosis appropriate. considering invasive risky diagnostic testing treatment options, diagnostic verification step particularly important patient exposed risks without reasonable chance testing treatment options informative likely improve patient outcomes.

I also said capitalism? thought private business deciding want serve sacrosanct right. also told way business makes point serve unvaccinated that's free enterprise works. profitable niche always filled.

He conceded. spent four hours school board meeting mask mandates yesterday, I’m subject matter expert they’re thinking. Overlap anti-vaccine anti-mask pretty strong. 

All absolutely false mentioned repeatedly public comment meeting:

1. Fauci profiting Covid, doctors pharmaceutical companies. invented virus and/or released it. Fauci made $20 million last year, also evil responsible every pandemic since ‘70s. 

2. variants part conspiracy released back-to-back keep us down.

3. Masks don’t work, giving kids RSV, causing become suicidal. masks gross impossible clean and/or replace. caused kid China heart attack. 

4. It’s worth trouble fight Covid enough people dying. 

5. Public meetings masks conducted day keep people attending (there literally hundreds people publicly announced meeting)

3. It’s socialist conspiracy. 

4. People wear masks mentally ill. People make children wear masks child abusers. 

5. Covid six times less dangerous flu.

I’m making sick stop get idea. diabetes. UK much better vaccine uptake rate adults US, helps. Also, according BBC, children 12-15 get vaccine immune system issues live someone Joe Rogan said...

There's also whole in-group/out-group signalling factor going   people beholden tribal politics, wanting strong father figure tell do, afraid admitting wrong, view sign weakness, wisdom, think disturbingly common viewpoint, taking fucking *horse dewormer* instead one many vaccines proven overwhelmingly safe effective.

This qualms saying field fucks give people lays fallow. die, care. I've read one many stories people saying still get vaccinated die hours days later ICU care anymore. We're missing light speed circumvention technology self-aware AI shedding mortal coil early. army. I’ve seeing many people posting “real data” ivermectin it’s great treatment Covid Facebook. use call shit out, there’s literally point anymore. Yeah, completely unaware common happened us wife first got pregnant. Totally blindsided gut punched, started hearing many women know say one well. It’s one crazily common things one really speaks about.  damn embarrassing. proud okie kick balls! took drugs meant bovine

*Equine Honestly, go town y’all, keep sucking Mectin don’t listen dosage- that’s liberal media trying tell what’s safe. Think patriots ignore need medical help? Like ignored common sense? Please….? 
I’m tired dumb fucks breathing oxygen. number yeah. I’m like 5’9” 170lbs.  used love America want move kid I'm coming realise country rather large amount dumb fucks it.. 

Truly mind blowing read things.  horse girl growing knew ivermectin back then, never expected next time life I’d hear like this. someone who's purposefully remained childless life feels beyond super weird seem concerned lives children damn parents.

Indeed, *I feel you*. Thank saying this. someone tell whole ivermectin bullshit got started? never heard two weeks ago, BAM, everywhere people getting poisoned. Give break This, unsarcastically. Stop trying make ivermectin happen. going happen. plural people Kansas Kansans???? Ah gotcha lol think it’s okay take something manufacturer even says shouldn’t taken covid? Why? think drug that’s parasites stop covid? Poison control uses science, definitely trusted Kansans.

Remember Kansans, trust medical science anything. vaccine, wearing masks, ingesting dangerous chemicals, certainly going hospital ignore rest medical advice magically decide medical advice treatment might personally help.

/s Okay seriously though, people treated specific circumstance now? understand ethics ethics letting actual victims die opposed people willfully chosing public safety measures yet still rewarded care? need stop awarding behavior. Somethings gotta give. 16 days still isn’t long Covid hopefully recover soon! adding said. trying disagree. situation simple look simply. Unfortunately, literally many idiots /s needed buying taking hydroxychloriquine ivermectin preventions case get Covid. Like taking normally anyone might take vitamin supplements. Pure. Fucking. Idiocy. timeframe doses? seems increasingly important. Canada, 8 weeks, vaccine effectiveness holding steady 80% cases 90+% hospitalization death.  Well, shouldn’t gunshot victims put front? Poetic justice... 4 even fuller protection. fuck afford that!? figured. Yeah anything say personal experience anecdotal means nothing. friend pregnant last year get vaccine became available. catch COVID nothing bad happened. What's ironic accuse everyone else using ""critical thinking"". think good thought process trying convince people fence getting vaccine actually get it? Makes come disingenuous makes people SKEPTICAL play confirmation bias allow positive experiences posted negative ones deleted banned. give true open dialogue comes censorship/having agenda. understand people make shit claim bad experience push agenda said good experiences too.

 People lie way know isn't. experiences left people look information decide want it. 

"" Experience science"" holds true experience agree agree okay stay? total double standard makes already skeptical people skeptical. 

Some people legit bad experiences know couple people have. seen eyes. also know people effects vaccine. Low blow walnuts man we’re left organ supportive therapy. Misinformation hurting people killing people,” Souza science clear on? Vaccines, said. “We don’t vaccinated patients here.” Well reports OTC Pepcid AC (famatodine) effective too. clinical trials need done early evidence weak. drug sounds promising doesn’t mean it’s effective proven be. solution billions data points vaccines. would anything else point?  are, need exceed certain level income quota.  could test out, go ask would happen. way could advise dad full confidence  Ah true. guess heard exact bit lol  I've seen family members vaccinated still got covid, feeling bad 3-4 weeks totally normal. course that's personal anecdote, 6 better now, keep spirits get lots rest! Let's think this: draw line?

You got car crash speeding.

Which examples blame instead treating you?

How determine deserving treatment idiot? decides? long take? appeal? representation? 

It insanely idiotic suggest try evaluate someone deserving treatment honestly cannot believe hit post comment typing it. Exactly. Entitled, selfish, ignorant. mix mass manipulation media outlets political agendas, playing growing issue independent life style every person themselves. hurts people failing see that. hope isnt lost cause know? countries vaccinating young children? guess update passports US might take approach 5 group. Relatively speaking, doctors want use ivermectin treat covid. someone kick overweight uncle stairs broke neck wouldn’t say “he fell hard heavy”.  would say “You murdered uncle!!!”  
Convenient linked paper published April, **before** Delta **before** several important pre-print studies included “meta analysis” withdrawn entirely ethical reporting failures. 

Why people keep sh-t like this? destroys argument. suing state. deal high Covid cases we'll pay case wins. I'm really tired state harm citizens. ... mean gangnam style? dumbass sister law spreading shot Facebook. That's good news! fully vaccinated tested positive today covid. Symptomatic: Fever, dry cough, chills, body aches, slight sore throat. day 2 symptoms, I'm praying get worse.

I masked washed hands diligently even lockdown, still got it.
Thank anti masking people anti vaccine people! Antivaxers/antimaskers need start BOYCOTTING hospitals!  get impression parents kids munching Tide pods. told sister specifically phrase question go ten Google pages get answer research, seeking reassurance. could around here. worst say no. Good luck I’m fully ready US say don’t want vaccine fine, you’re literally back line medical procedures COVID national state emergency. r/The10thDentist know you, favorite person today. probably went Tractor Supply “real meds.” Technically like gets slot even opens yes 💰  former Alabamian well—I used live Bessemer, Birmingham, Lipscomb, Homewood. Yeah, Bessemer “rough” (as know) chronically listed one dangerous cities US 1 34 chance victim violent crime compared overall rate 1 196 state Alabama. lot problems Bessemer/Birmingham surrounding areas contribute “rough” COVID sub, social sciences like. 

Point being, yeah, you’re probably partially right probably couldn’t care less COVID want fuck get school. all, they’re kids even care it’s added bonus. young people live impoverished, high-crime area red state etc. etc. doesn’t mean aren’t aware care. gives reason to. seeing history, bad policy, virus ways it’s handled disparately affected communities. renegades social change-makers past young too. 

I doubts sometimes younger people (am parent, around kids lot, eyes), need stop discounting youth things can’t help, come parents are. Maybe saw opportunity day off, sure. even it’s making headlines concerns, “genuine” not. gotta faith young people. haven’t exactly shown high priority country past year half. another poster said, eligible something (like vaccine) automatic guarantee person get various reasons barriers. 

This isn’t attack btw, thoughts parallels read thread. Ooh, rhymed. 

Poor Bama. Sweet Home. girlfriend's hospital patient right missing skin 80% chest. claims bad reaction vaccine. clear harmed something like lye acid. showed picture. guy's whole chest looks like back buddy's hand lye scene fight club.

2. Everything else creating sentences things want order get back facts listed point #1  went chiropractor two years. probably would gone indefinitely stopped it. hurt back carrying something back went spasm. figured go back doctor, aka, chiropractor. two years felt “relief” couldn’t sit properly chair airplane seat. favor one hip. time I’d get treatment he’d shove hip back pelvis. one day stretching sneaker heel got caught rug pulling leg heard audible POP. didn’t hurt, fact felt better. sat problem sitting sitz bones. went chiropractor told hip pulled *out* felt better pushed said Oh freak things happens people can’t reproduced like patient felt better kids jumped him. (Again, stretching) shoved hip back limped home. never went back again. managed pop hip back fine years. hurt time went PT. AMAZING! That’s strengthening muscles stabilize joints, “aligning” like stack jenga blocks. I’ve huge fan physical therapy ever since. Here’s Surprised Pikachu face Trying get one 66 year old dad he’s hesitant bc FDA approved yet. got second shot February, walk pharmacy get it? Kim Jong Un selfish piece shit values optics actual lives...who knew? Excellent points! I'm wondering wave ICU death rates may trend higher due several things addition point staffing: ICUs unvaxed, chances they're also anti-mask, wonder avg viral loads compared last summer avgs. Also, may waiting longer seek treatment, Delta varient pernicious, window getting benefits treatments available (Regeneron, etc) slammed shut. Really wish US would pick won't. Report harassment. people banned sub shit, bypassing ban DM people directly.   know.  hope impact world supply bourbon... Honestly, don’t switch priority order? people get priority non-covid related patients? showed gun shot wound told wait sure hell bet I’d making scene kick one freeloaders bed get one Boomers vaccinated age group younger them. general, problem comes covid. pedantic note: ""cure"" something reverse infection.

The vaccine prophylactic - prevents infection, cure it. poor job isolating themselves. Making lower priority kicking out. Children finally pulling weight.

It matter time cases would spike schools opened. Even masks, 20+ students class safe, mention lunch. knows kids outside school, can't really force masks then. one ever talks J&amp;J vaccine get another shot every year one well? Also side effects repeat like first time got it? got fever 102 got really sick day got J&amp;J shot.  Funny chiropractors center anti vaccine bullshit. whole business pseudo science make encompassing. went graduation Life University (even thought teach chiro) talking curing fucking cancer w chiropractic “medicine” really masterpiece disease, isn’t it? 80% adults immunity, still TEARING unvaccinated.    wishful thinking think side effects 2nd dose, bad booster? I'm higher risk i'll get booster soon authorize group 2nd dose scary. almost went ER, bad, i'm really sitting like.....I never want go again, i've seen people say felt worse 2nd dose rough time 2nd suppose.

If feel ""worse"" 2nd.....i'd need 911 standby. Died Jan 9th 2020, confirmed first Covid 19 US Death. Although obvously administered case case basis professional probably anything covid, know whats left reports self use meant use humans. Avermectin Ivermectin actually nobel prize 2015 use animals HUMANS Cure pandemic, disease....yes? weird think like 65% people protesting vaccinated birth. remember seeing statistics somewhere. wish could find back comment. point, let natural selection take over, waste resources people poisoning horse de-wormer. number serious cases considered bland foods like rice mashed potatoes? cousin still dealing it’s slowly improving foods taste fine weird list like strawberries great carrots awful. may experiment different things. r/covidlonghaulers may help Triage hospital setting gets available bed, say ""who kick bed make space new patient""

If dumdums dangerous condition got bed, still unethical kick thats saying!

This makes sense all. countries high immunity fine. getting pummelled 

Me comprende CDC warn day, listen, remember (censored) believe science distrust anything anyone remotely smells like science. Remember boomers used mock kids eating tide pods? My, tables turned.  really care people eating Ivermectin, injecting clorox, eating laundry detergent capsules. 


Let learn hard way. I'm expert, think something like this:

* virus = bug (e.g. ""I caught stomach bug going around)
* worm = also bug (because lives ground and/or gross)
* dewormer = kills bugs
* ???
* Profit (for drug companies)  Fixed thou. 9800 deaths?????? would US equivalent 352,000 deaths per day. sure got data right?

if meant assuming high number cases would lead high number deaths, factually wrong too. backdating 3 weeks deaths standard right now, average 11 deaths per day 1//6th peak even though number cases (also backdated) half peak. deaths 60% less before.

remarkably, 60% vaccination leads 60% less deaths. funny works Love hear hell hospital ICU still full 80% immunity covid though? 

i understand 

Isn't well high enough convey herb immunity? 

Something make sense. US like 50 countries, state approach, rules, regulations, restrictions, vaccination plans (in addition federal centers), etc. cannot generalize. large cities like NYC live, city government also pays huge role, Dept Health city hospitals testing vaccinations, addition state federal centers. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

So see him, little massage shows stretches, asks wanted try dry needling. said okay, it, really feel anything different, changes week. next appointment, *still* feel different week. Third time, explained seeing improvement really frustrated. said could skip it, still agonizing pain, said I'd give one try.

That third one actually started help. still concerned placebo effect figured it'd help couple weeks. session every week for... long time. Like 12 weeks? Lol trapezius strain seriously bad. actually continue helping improving point looked forward it. muscle twitches really goddamn painful could barely stand it.

But since finished, recurrence strain knots shoulder. honestly expected nothing all, happily surprised.

I'm really sure I'm getting here, tested studied treatments better placebo results 1000% better ""here, let pop spine"" 😑 Sergeant said.
