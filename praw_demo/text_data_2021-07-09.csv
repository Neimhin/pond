0,2021-07-09," That's literally worst part pandemic. People gonna die become chronically ill even pandemic treatments delayed much.   Even new infectious delta variant, strongly protected severe disease (getting hospitalized). However, youve lot contact still non-trivial probability catching asymptomatic mildly symptomatic case covid. dont worried health, keep eye symptoms, get tested feel anything. kiddos school requires proof vaccination attendance. I’d curious weigh risks COVID issues vs risks developing socially generally heightened anxiety level? (Plus intangibles like missing another year making childhood memories)   really hard compare countries countries everything specific. surprised US simply also infected people overall Americans careful begin height pandemic. probably good amount people naturally infected top people vaccinated helps slow spread. also couple weeks behind UK people saying matter time, see. point, cases going surprising. question is, hospitalizations go well? can't freak every time cases go inevitable open things up.

&amp;#x200B;

I sometimes wonder prolonged lockdowns actually bit harmful probably something said bit natural immunity well. guess CDC dropped mask mandates herd immunity, either vaccinations naturally sped up. sister, yes, Hope not. I'm comfortable people wearing mask situations I'm fully vacced. wear grocery store one place everyone, healthy sick alike, need visit. Yup, confirm. First shot awful, zero effects second. Great! majority 12-17 y/o vaccinated point wall text rambled masking forever. I'll admit person went cardiac arrest mutual friend Step-dad literally diagnosed hospital. feel like based fact know 2 separate cardiac events healthy men small area related second dose makes scared. someone smokes I'm even afraid. 😰

I promise I'm genuine... know think. end day probably still get vaccine better option anyway.

Edit: thanks info way! first dose shingles vaccine back January made sick 101.5 fever two days. I’d never bad reaction vaccine that. Got Moderna doses couple months ago aside minor aches pains felt fine. 

My sense you, like me, never really cared vaccine side effects followed social media posts them. It’s like product reviews Amazon. Even highly rated items still ton negative reviews say it’s worst thing ever bought. Covid forever. seasonal like flu. never going away. 

I understand people like think end game is. Lock forever? Even everyone vaccinated, covid remain, evolve, cause illness. causing death rate flu - case vaccinated individuals - there's zero reason remain closed. never going stop causing infections. hit 41% fully vaccinated actually.

Another big thing reporting around 50 new cases daily vs 500+ NL reporting opened up.

We also indoor restrictions (limited capacity, dancing, sit only, mingling tables)

Hopefully don’t see spike… feel like everyone forgetting adults vaccinated point, especially vulnerable people. 
The second thing people forget lot tests done last week. look graphs much correlated increase infection.

So yes little premature, chance we'll see march 2020 again. see looking hospitalisations IC hospitalisations, 10 0 respectively. infections going high, escaping that. like everyone forgot vaccinations stop infections, makes symptoms less severe. Unless keep country lockdown forever infections going skyrocket. meant happen. Technically fixed percentage growth ""exponential"": savings account pays 0.01% per year (seriously!) would growing ""exponentially""... doubling every 70 centuries.

R 1.01 would double every 7000 cycles maintained long enough, scary ""doubling every 3 weeks"" people think - close 1 easily dip 0.99, means slow shrinkage instead growth. bet conspiracy nuts blowing collective gaskets right Except course getting vaccine puts patients unnecessarily risk. Fingers crossed reckless actions end someone dying feared vaccines decades research done make sure they're safe.  Assuming got delta variant, second dose gives much higher protection. Good thing you’re vaccinated, outcome could much worse. think thing kids killed gun violence schools. happened once, parents got together demanded everyone able SEE happened children, there'd sea change virtually overnight comes opinions gun control.

It's exact reason Emmett Till's mother allowed son photographed open casket funeral - *wanted* world see kind sick, depraved, evil lived ""the heart"" America, one things ignited civil rights movement. I'm genuinely curious work students. obviously nurse vaccination records covid required public school I'm sure work compared required vaccinations. odds two people know getting myocarditis astronomically high. high raise skepticism post. statistics CDC: 

“The benefits (prevention COVID-19 disease associated hospitalizations, ICU admissions, deaths) outweighed risks (expected myocarditis cases vaccination) populations vaccination recommended. However, balance benefits risks varied age sex cases myocarditis primarily identified among males aged &lt;30 years, risks poor outcomes related COVID-19 increase age. Per million second doses mRNA COVID-19 vaccine administered males aged 12–29 years, 11,000 COVID-19 cases, 560 hospitalizations, 138 ICU admissions, six deaths due COVID-19 could prevented, compared 39–47 expected myocarditis cases COVID-19 vaccination (Table 2). 

Among males aged ≥30 years, 15,300 COVID-19 cases, 4,598 hospitalizations, 1,242 ICU admissions, 700 deaths could prevented, compared three four expected myocarditis cases COVID-19 Awesome. Hope roll quickly citing article 2020. America even Alpha back then. Infections school aged kids UK extremely common. EU certificates digitally signed private key?  OK. Makes sense. hand R also increasing, would higher exponential growth, right?  quite 

Here's light reading effects asymptomatic mild/moderate cases. seems there's lot we're still discovering effects Covid-19 duration. Asymptomatic equal absence ill effects.

“The researchers found elevations C5b9 patients severe COVID-19 MIS-C, surprise, also found C5b9 elevated patients minimal asymptomatic disease. 22 patients complete data available, 19 (86%) met criteria TMA [thrombotic microangiopathy]. Additionally, sC5b9 levels elevated patients meet criteria TMA. Although children COVID-19 severe disease, study shows may effects SARS-CoV-2 worthy retrospectively investigated patients confirmed diagnosis COVID-19 show symptoms.

I could buy used Corolla-- take ""moral"" stand?

I like Corollas. People also party government says can't.  Misery Olympics. suck. couldn’t done anything prevent deaths. Every country world deaths, all, global pandemic… great news need keep saying: children 12 CANNOT get vaccinated.

Those get vaccinated need stop spread unvaccinated. Amalfi area (Positano, Capri), Napoli Rome. mean wearing masks, especially crowded, touristy areas huge number people nose lol.  right. I'd like also apologize, saying ""just get move like did!"" short really intended say made comment. suppose excitement getting hell still lingering. understand easy get go somewhere completely different. right time showed jumped hesitate. I'm sorry got disability. hope someday able know Kansas family good. always thought hole can't get of. said, things seem LOT cheaper good reason stay! step dad developed Myocarditis second dose hospitalized. also know guy went cardiac arrest needed defribulated. He's alive also Myocarditis getting second dose.

I nervous get second dose hear mostly happening young men. safe? Yes, study February May majority infections time Gamma &amp; Lambda strains. also lied serious case covid actually was. US. 
Do bit Google searching find hundreds schools closed days weeks flu season. personally live western PA pretty much every year schools close due Older people well vaccinated US. Well NY northeast general done well vaccination wise. Sad schools want continue move backwards region moves forward I’m almost jealous people died right pandemic. sick living shit. 

That said, I’m sorry loss. outsiders perspective comes shock dont make policy nice comfortable remote work. crazy people still believe fantasy. virus stay. Get used it.  really. Antivax idiots would put vaccination causes ED shaky Facebook video Caribbean educated OD deplorable crew would buy 100%. understand people strawman hard....

Keep cases low everyone ability fully vacinated. 

This completly reasonable position. can’t British parents, sister, nieces grandma? Europeans said article multiple country’s one country  Ugh… hope works out. two kids send back fall, want to… NEED go back. I’m super worried idiotic rural district MI right; haven’t yet. I’ve literally heard one saying cells going make spikes based mRNA basically stab cells death die.  people like who, time being, evaluated told personal doctor second opinion *NOT* get vaccine yet? 

You need personally evaluated believe not, least time being, risks need considered. different doctor emergency medical staff need know currently take *other* medication real complications. 

Now ""anti-vaxxer"", incredible technology. say listen anyone medical professionals access personal medical information dangerous. 

That's do. Talk doctor folks, decide good get whichever one right, go get it. not, ask *medical* reason why, political opinion. ? reddit dawg, one reads articles Probably banned airline too. airlines sharing list unruly passengers, it'll fun drive.  65-ish% pro-vaccine, 35-ish% anti-vaccine.

Wait - even read article?  course does.

It's Pavlovian would funny tragic. Anything pro-science, pro-vaccine, worst endorsed President must opposed yahoos. 

And yeah, sure, Darwinism thing. overwhelming majority unvaccinated people get Covid die. least U.S. They'll use medical resources gone people, need attention medical personnel already worn out, endanger innocent people around them, end long Covid symptoms make even miserable already were. still wont waive patent.  fined more. I’m guessing pretty much completely wrong everything. Whew. I'm clear. Guess cross ""stuff might costing sex"" list. guys think, listen? you’re one! found you. Explain virus need mutate unvaccinated easily infect without mutating? need mutate. makes sense virus mutates cant infect vaccinated people. really… therein lies problem No, banned working patients medicine. truly nurse, one worst kind. shouldn’t even fucking dental hygienist without shots. Easter 2022  hard situation. flu vaccine fully FDA approved, covid shots emergency authorization. It’s slightly different situation. law seems increasingly side employers case though. Need get overall vaccination rates 85 90% population.

Until then, need keep moderate controls place unvaccinated overwhelm hospitals create yet another ""emergency lockdown"", drive us bonkers. feels like alternate reality sometimes. Sydney affected. parents live rural nsw life normal Singapore's study positive cases (even asymptomatic). symptomatic cases, percentage 80-90% reduction (much line England) rest Australia fall way. Australia large cities spread covid spread states lockdown still occuring Sydney. Melbourne spread cases go anywehre else significantly. why... can’t make something mandatory it’s people’s religion. That’s common excuse anti-vaxxers go excuse people don’t want political mistrust reasons. part Maine, 85% adults vaccinated. We're living normal lives here. Eh.

They could probably another survey fuck someone got vaccine, would similar results. vax prevents hospitalization/serious illness

True, even Europe, still 30-40% unvaccinated population. hospitals still fill up, unvaccinated.

Do let happen start turning people away hospitals? think anyone stomach that.

Or lock hard hospitals full yet again? Nobody wants that.

Maybe maintain sensible light rules (no indoor rooms 500 people 2 hours dancing yelling) - hospitals totally full point.

I think middle ground going way easier handle either two alternatives.    It’s technicality. vaccines gone full traditional process FDA approval. approved emergent basis go back actual approval process later time. cannot force employee receive vaccine medication FDA approved. 

That said, us chose get vaccine immediately anyways. looking forward mandatory.

German sex workers … imported much poorer countries. good manners! selfless.

Because logistics, doubt we'll see videos many COVID patients struggling dying ICU. would need patient (and maybe family) consent press/info release. hospital would also need okay it, would likely bounce request PR legal teams would likely discourage idea due HIPAA liability exposure. Additionally, hospital systems trying increase elective surgeries much possible preserve hospital revenue, foreboding image death ICU going encourage people come hospital 100% elective surgery.

You don’t know personal situations. exactly imbeciles don’t belong medicine?

I’ll answer. politics getting better true CA really wel early on.

The entire country outside NYC really well early masks reopening became politicized, CA avoided huge outbreaks could far far worse saw.

What even mean. California arguably strictest covid restrictions country one last stars yo reopen remove restrictions.  worry, half EU going follow two three weeks, except maybe, Germans? I’d research. I’ve heard RSV, don’t want give real opinion. last months I’ve heard scientists follow closely say lockdowns hurting people’s immunities largely fallacy Yeah talk spreading people, keep mind asymptomatic people aren’t really spreading all, lot vaccinated infections asymptomatic.

Also 60% efficacy rate low, I’ve literally never seen number anywhere else.  continue wearing mask social distancing not. countries moved approach beyond me. need vaccine passports need enforcement. want vaccinated stay f\*ck home. might virologist, see QUESTION MARKS? asking want know going on, protection. FFS. proving point then. newborn doesn’t extensive history virus exposure adult. one year newborn toddler could used build immune system.

Someone might want let know school's summer. amateur numbers. don’t think you’re positing makes lot sense though. Like one year socially distanced isn’t going make body forget whatever immunity it’s learned hand test, tell best. Yep. That's find bizarre hear someone going ""fear-mongering"". Fear-mongering? Throughout whole pandemic, things usually turned *worse* predictions called pessimistic time. Think Fauci warning last year many 250,000 Americans could die get thing control, we're 600,000+.

We're war Covid-19, never underestimate opponent.  I’m also glad don’t work medical industry Buh freedumbs liberties unobstructed death!!!! it’s causing lot vaccine breakthroughs variants did. fact think symptoms would take 20 years appear tells know nothing vaccines. legitimate long term effects covid vaccines would seeing early large populations people. syncytial virus. viruses exist besides coronaviruses?

Like, hem, delta thing. Why? It’s College town? RSV? Unfortunately give birth soon. thought unvaccinated people catching baby makes sick. pun intended. people able go clubs one shot?

Only Janssen vaccin one shot, others two jabs.  got one mRNA vaccines. far don’t think US vaccines attenuated virus. J&amp;J DNA-based vaccine uses non-pathogenic virus carrier (the virus related Covid). mRNA vaccines likely safest around, though doesn’t seem like vaccines pose much risk people. medical waiver problematic really thing. was, could sell bottles saline market COVID cure. buy long sign waiver. could use unnecessary medical procedures cover yourself. ethical would think. Also ethical trick healthcare professional perform medical service agree to. 

I never intimidated CDC agency infallible, lay person capable deep understanding COVID pandemic. reading summary study blindly agreeing conclusions without ability call bullshit based data methods 
are truly capable reading study. media hyping up. could say Dutch Government opened everything soon. went closed (night)clubs 100% open. Also Dutch person, know avoid/bend rules. 

People complaining government, young adults more, take responsibility self.  Indeed would make trends look similar. Los Angeles County doubled past Los Angeles County Department Public Health (Public Health) confirms doubling new cases week 1,107 new cases COVID-19. Last Friday, Public Health reported 549 COVID-19 320 people COVID-19 currently hospitalized; increase 280 hospitalizations reported last daily test positivity rate 2.4%, increase last week’s rate 1.5%. Clubs aren’t really opened here, parties outside allowed testing vaccinated That’s true CA really wel early on. masks reopening became politicized, CA avoided huge outbreaks could far far worse saw. Also lack's data human rights, economics, tolerance, environmental impacts  Depending test got, may also inaccurate. quick tests garbage, imo hospital work takes certain tests transfer patients. acceptable tests, run cleaning them. misunderstood meant too. could always edit clear. people paying attention spike RSV cases US south NZ, indicating may immunity debt incurred due kids going school/daycare masked time year?

I keep seeing people Twitter/Reddit obsessed kids still can’t get vaccinated don’t want “take chance unknown long term effects” clear evidence COVID impact children nearly common general population outbreaks RSV land kids hospital. worry we’re thinking we’re setting children robust immune system constantly protecting :( can't answer know.

I've wondered would happened SARS MERS popped 2020? contained robust organization dismantled time covid run amok. say anything vaccines losing ability protect sort fear mongering; many vaccines loss efficacy time, get boosters. Tetantus every 10 years, yadda yadda. 


The concern brought shit stays constant 'pandemic' level threat long, could overlap certain segment population's ""wane"" curve. legitimate concern, albeit one happen within next 6 months year, we're lucky. (Although, talking boosters Delta Variant really kicked gear, so.) benefit doubt curious, study shows number Neutralizing antibodies produced different combinations. 2 shots sinovac combination yields good enough response SV+SV+AZ really takes notch LOT. That's it. data yet, maybe we'll wait actual paper peer reviewed released.

Thank u/east_62687 Nepal dire situation well. need loads vaccines countries world. OP city. It’s atrocious what’s happening citizens overseas. However, genuinely couldn’t life reasons (sick family, mortgage etc) leave, others knew rolled dice figured would soon bad lose visas come home despite government advice contrary. people less sympathy. May ages 65+ 84% least 1 dose 71.9% fully vaccinated. Like UK, US focused early vaccination efforts front line workers elderly, parents vaccinated Feb. like every age group varies state. article can't link contains politics compares fully vaccinated older adults Utah 57.6% Vermont 87%. saying people enter clubs never leave them? high-risk ppl also avoid areas ppl visited clubs went afterwards? (like supermarkets) hospital company. trying agree bars clubs issue. implying virtually nobody NL wearing masks anymore. sure, drag another meaning call ridiculous upvotes Considering Chicago third populated city US, situation could’ve hell lot worse strict measures place. So, stated previously, state actually take pretty seriously. federal court already upheld vaccine mandate employees fired refusing vaccinated. surprise every person working microbiology level 1 trauma center got vaccinated without much hesitancy. However, fellow lab scientist chemistry heme 60/40 vaccinated.

It's different forced handle dozens upon dozens sputum samples every single shift. literally dig covid patients vent juice find chunky bits since that's secondary bacterial infection hiding. thousand times want fucking shot. 😂😂😂 new slogan gov one  think time cancel bookings Valencia August... :( Fully vaccinated family, still cannot go. Yup, know Dr.s refuse get vaccinated.  everyone vaccinated it? ""People like me"" think end game eradication prevention mass vaccination. need hit target even dream fully opening. there! artificial thing horizon anymore, end there! people appointments, wait done! Good really need vaccinate everybody world start talking 3rd shots etc. mean, also expose people *dying,* worse.  Update effective delta. mRNA vaccines gone body day absolutely chance cancer. Thank much. information good enough me! I'd like take look! course people dying around world IMO closing border sooner would prevented deaths. Looking treatment instead vaccine would prevented deaths well. say sooner means beginning 2020 knew something bad coming. mean abandoned Denmark? coronaapp much use Denmark right now. It’s approved outside emergency use yet. solid vaccination target try hit that. keep masks capacity rules then? understand Illinois 18th Covid cases 16th deaths per 100k.

So, state take serious measures make difference? number vary lot easy access free tests are, willingness test. large differences country country  understand wanting get J&amp;J, though would hard beat choice. even J, chances anything wrong incredibly low conspiracy theories pushing worries. What’s sure long COVID cannot die anything else  That's fucked up. Mayor sounds like asshole. Looks like they're trying get Australian living overseas expected nothing less. Luckily intention going back daughter get meet grandparents years rate. home selfish people I've encountered far. dont check ID even use someone else test.  I'm starting see pattern. hero’s don’t want jab fudging numbers again.  
From state provided information state stopped reporting number non-residents Florida new weekly reporting method.

So die Florida Covid officially live part count. shit different day. course people died Covid really matter it? /S Ugh. right. :( One good friends runs daycare house LA county also one COVID case amongst kids staff. Yes, colds maybe stomach bug two gone thru, one tested positive.  Desantis trustworthy, pay attention data scientist sitting jail… fact don’t fill form know you’re one good guys. directly related comment made earlier [here] There's little empathy outside narrow worldview Australian life supposed frankly disheartening.  thing killed lot people careful. variant nasty people walking around precautions. places vax rates low going get slammed. COVID vaccines aren’t required vaccination list. sad truth probably won’t see full authorization FDA applies kids 12. Right isn’t even emergency authorization US giving vaccines kids 12. Even then, loopholes accomadate anti-vax nutjob parents many states allow unvaccinated kids still attend public schools. Lol know

Shitty true true.

edit: upvoted! FWIW treatable skews towards young men + boys.  Hahahhaa hahahahahaha, starting get disappointed hasn’t mass die  took vaccine? I’m….livid. could done much, like push get 20-30s vaccinated summer start. hope stay well. 

Instead, last line, told behave wait. IMO much higher priority. 

( still don’t understand took nearly 3 months vaccinate 70 up, every cohort 2 week blocks. 

The whole damn management pandemic Hugo rutte fucked right up. 

And schools open 2 months there’s indication they’ll plan 12. I’m vaccinated, husband, kid’s sitting duck infection. 

We waited another 3-4 weeks “summer, ECONOMY”.

This deranged. bot sucks, insulting anyone, used naughty word. subreddit PG rated something? Damn..... Bali December 2019 Japan needs get tough put first plane back already country. shit going straight Supreme Court. likely alot tourism vacationing well. Vaccinations stop infections, still carrier spread virus. least story months ago, wrong?  Deaths behind cases, yes, vaccines would seeing waaaaaay deaths now. Last time 2 week difference.

That's 15k+ cases per day beginning 2 weeks ago - 29 deaths yesterday.

While life lost horrible, compare end November/start December numbers, per 15k cases per day rising 480-500 deaths 2 weeks after. Big difference. That's makes sense. nutjobs think people lose livelihoods getting vaccine approved, way. people dumber anti vaxxers like many commentors thread.

When approved, im sure many get it. Lets wait approval. slim chance, doesnt get approval......there reason.

Fingers crossed good every one jumps board. edited post bit specific. point? Enforce passports high uptake achieved longer needed Well depends expect government. must say I’m happy didn’t live country need permission leave house wear mask outside. Norwegian approach restrictions depends street walking on. 

Restrictions relative risk, feel Netherlands. (Up government blatantly forgot factor delta variant)  ...they learn. That's problem. people 60+ years earth, decided knew everything needed age 18. matter enough information. Pretty sure wrong.  Oh thought over?
/s staff follow standard precautions

I laughed have, still going.  hope close everything lol.

Probably not. expect hospital ICUs get crowded, surgeries cancelled that. Polish hospitals might well plan this.

From ecdc data around 40% 80 year olds Poland vaccinated little difference numbers full partial vacination likely elderly want, lack access. 

Also, vaccination totally protect, protects much better groups, herd. done. think fully vaccinated still careful, delta far transmissible. vaccine protects lot, delta around (and around me) want risk catching long covid even smell/taste sense messed with. RIVM mRNA vaccine currently Phase 3 trials Mexico - Walvax-Abogen. talking contract Fosun &amp; BioNTech Fosun like Pfizer - distributor &amp; manufacturer, vaccine same. far know, waiting government approval restructuring manufacturing lines (because initially Fosun supposed get another variant Biontech vaccine). Awww, hope not. might idiot, make bad person.

Maybe sucks deserves that, know. I've desperate dates past, done stupid shit result, kinda feel guy (vaccine issues aside). really problem though, good data Western vaccines comes partner countries rather countries developed them. Chinese manufacturers partnered poorly, whether deliberately otherwise, good data forthcoming. country; dentists berating patients coming dental checkup mask on. Keep mind, talking coronavirus full uncontained form here. reproductive R factor alpha variant masked social distancing environment around 2 3 lockdown. basically dont even know true R factor, didnt implement containment social distancing. might 10 50, 88% asyptomatic vccinated become useless quite fast. Dude exaggerating make point stop know hundreds people got covid one “long covid”. chance getting low worried it. Long covid not, young people get seriously sick elderly risks clogging healthcare system covid minimal. 

First closed protect healthcare system, closed save lives, closed ramp vaccinations. 

What going close for? give Jeff Bezos another bil net worth? give banks couple small businesses seize? 

At point another lockdown start wondering conspiracy theories spreading like wildfire. Conspiracy theories start sounding believable fucking news. I've supported government's covid policy long time (even though always fully agree). Mistakes made, could learn (or thought).

But reckless. many red flags relaxations enacted. many experts disagreeing. many countries learn from. many reasons bit cautious delta variant.

And EVEN then, said ""sorry guys, fucked terribly, need reimpose restrictions make right"", would upset course, would appreciated honesty, would hoped (again...) would lesson next time.

But didn't. take responsibility, even gall blame everyone themselves. ""People checking QR codes thorough enough"", ""youth exchanged QR codes"", ""youth known better go party mere hours got JJ vaccine"".

They even started blaming European countries travel restrictions based number infections, instead number hospitalizations. Even though number obviously irrelevant countries, want keep infected asses country.

It's absolutely infuriating, they've entirely lost support.  ""transport""?  Yeah zero cases.... Weight loss require exercise. 

Risk assessment depends many cases zone, variants, particular risk factors. one defending criminal corporations. Shhhhhhh!!!!

There case Covid China. 

Covid defeated there. entire family, including me, fully vaccinated, received second shot mid-June, mind calm. curiosity, honest. hope close everything lol. uptake surprisingly high too. Thanks clarifying! would say non graduate fans teams are…strange me.  kind issues allergy vaccine ingredients would suggest getting vaccinated? Live like flu possible happened Poland (with effectively restrictions going window) cases going around 100/day around 0,02% test positivity month

The virus literally particles continuous things. lot infected people delta around staying home, superspreader events. India cases year, assigning lot reasons, well, got l get prepared another wave? 

We seen covid reach everywhere. think sooner later evert single country going get boom cases caused delta, sooner later. race delta vaccination, maybe places like Malta Iceland escape it, low vaccination countries mainland Europe, get sooner later. Pay particular attention unvaccinated young people holidaying outside returning, sooner later one going pass delta lot mates party, legal ilegal.

Poland lots available vaccines around right? not, right best time get vaccinated (Well best time 3/4 weeks + 2 weeks ago), everybody else care about.  Delta variant leads far fewer hospitalisations deaths vaccinated. even get infected vaccinated, far less serious. prevalent delta zone? prevalent, JJ provide immunity faster. urgent, wait 3/4 weeks second dose Pfizer Pfizer 2 doses likely provides protection single dose JJ. imagine depends location within Kansas?   matter end? you’d rather get hit car risk breaking bones spend YEARS rehab, getting spicy flu? post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

It's going long battle, probably bad far over. Anyone feel comfortable returning gym fully vaccinated? I’m bit nervous myself, need lose quarantine weight somehow.

By british mean dont show emotions guy work went ER chest pains according him, thought heart attack. skinny 40 year old dude. 

I don’t really know details said hormone regulates heart beat present large amounts blood they’re currently tests figure why. wonder it’s related vaccine got month two ago. seems fine even back work briefly yesterday, leave testing. It’s kinda crazy uptake misleading, best. non-resident numbers still tracked reported CDC, databases pull from, like NYT. place find included Florida DOH weekly PDF reports. Well, people can't vaccinated sadly confined willing cult members. simp. confident enough go pub outdoor tables first venture back normality 2 months 2nd jab.

Myself 1 group caught virus self isolating whole family. sucks feels like minor cold thanks vaccine guess.

Only decide want take chance. There's guarantees. may end eliminating coronavirus regions. proves wrong many levels. can't that. Ya well they're allowed basically change DNA. started adult life socialist, worked government UK major parties, dealt successes failures directly, find I'm economically centrist socially liberal. bad, 85 percent vaccination rate achieved Delta.     Well, rate higher - lot things go unreported. 

But either way, yes. coincidence. could coincidence 2 thread, could coincidence got symptoms taking vaccine, nothing vaccine.

I'm much sus many people see reddit claiming caught covid 2 doses vaccine, given statistics, this. CA NY STILL lead covid deaths advice might received wantingly thought. BuTThereAReONly144REporTedCaSeS..
Sorry hear wife got sick. scrolling comments report 3th case. Still people claim 144 cases tiny risk. seems risk alot bigger stated vaccine makers self (big supprise /s) 1. Yes look happens countries, example UK. Result there: amount hospitalizations death like previous waves. Something like 10% (which would take might die flue otherwise, like elderly). 

2. might issue. However, long COVID seems temporary, although sucks people impaired concentration, memory shortness breath time, we're talking people dying here. trade-off made, different trade-off before. personally also think people accept 100% safety exist. Go! already safe, exercising important health. Wow. live, chain drugstores test everyone, questions asked. choose rapid (antigen) PCR, insurance cash needed. We're seeing big increase deaths. gone 10 day 30, absolutely nothing compared first second waves. giving % increase without actual numbers misleading. Woah look speed goal posts people take first two, still take one. 

A booster help situation. personally won’t fully vaccinated September, it’s certainly off. Latter part comment kind issue though - far official guidance concerned July 19th, part play avoid shutting again. Unvaccinated people commute, work, socialise protection, measures use vaccines threshold inherently discriminatory them. group people also blamed cases inevitably rise, god forbid government ever takes responsibility.

Don’t see can’t reduce 8 week gap make sure second jabs arms boost overall immunity sake everyone go mass reopening they’re insistent delaying day Well course, legitimate exceptions accepted, well people don’t possibility it’s available country logistics problems. 

I’m talking anti vax smartasses people waiting “see happen” religious turds. Reports people Malta say mostly students many foreign language schools. tell many cases would result 177 million interactions infected individual someone unvaccinated.. ? 
Or maybe tell chance develop myocarditis get COVID-19. 
Antivaxxers bet already eating shit up. Companies don’t authorize vaccines. conduct trials, compile data submit FDA review. FDA makes call without complete compelling data, won’t get EUA.  delay first second vaccine dose UK hopefully playing part bother US much - info one dose better alpha delta, two doses protection.

In UK, 8 weeks min doses (for vast majority people) strictly went age groups. So, *most* people 35 still single dosed, despite us lowest rate vaccine skepticism world. 

The USA overall waaaaay lower uptake vaccines, spread ages might better barrier transmission? would imagine USA, percentage 30s double-vaccinated WAY higher UK moment time? mention, USA massively less densely populated UK - hopefully get peaks like communities low vaccine rates, who've sensible enough protect stop cases skyrocketing nationwide like UK.

I hope anyway, I'm UK desperate get US see partner. :/ No, didn't. passed law required universities issue OPTIONAL ANONYMOUS surveys camous's political views free students faculty felt expressing political views.

Coincidence? younger one is, higher chances gets disease. makes usage total statistics incorrect Yeah, pretty bad confirmed media outlets, We'll know fall long antibodies maintain sufficient level fend virus. current vaccines get us fall, likely need boosters months. Als new vaccine, longevity determined. Join us, *join us*...

-Canada Yeah thats tried explaining. know odds similar either way. take vaccine something goes wrong, me. would've meant made wrong choice know live possibility. least Covid quarantine wear mask diminish odds getting infected. slightly control. 

I flu shot 6 years, time gotten flu once. possible early stages it, symptoms arose, accidently spread elderly person walking street person died. us could have. There'd way know. No, 3 months?? able get vaccine soon disease Yep :( family El Salvador got Sinovac. I'm worried 92 year old grandmother. We're scared needles still get kick watching kids squirm doctor's office. hospital? many ways one, fucked.

It’s easier live resign tbh True, country China has. city live cases recently, 13 million people (or abouts) tested 3 times 10 days, cases found isolated, anyone may came contact confined home extra testing. city clear weeks. low level sustained community transmission, squash hard.  Rani definitevely suffer. let's hail cow crippled make media star instead putting down. continue close everything ifs. Downvote want, closing everything point fucking selfish. 

The people bear brunt whole thing low-income working class one seems give single fuck them. see politicians, CEOs, corporations slogans stay home save lives that. 

In meantime low-tier income class getting shafted across board inflation, less job opportunities lower wages. 

Downvote want pretend right thing make feel like good person. title feels incomplete/misleading. fails mention exactly *how* miniscule risk truly is. According article itself, 177 million total Pfizer doses given study, 283 inflammation cases reported. 0,0001% vaccinations.

Additionally, even someone *were* included 0,0001% get myocarditis, article states easily treated typical medicine used disease. Making easily treatable. 

I understand people deserve know risk exists, time make mistakes like these, people need get vaccines. editorialize shamelessly downvote pointed out. Facts alone problematic. Sky News propaganda.   Pfizer BionTech two different companies… yes matters. one tech one industrialization muscle knowledge. Good team. alternating primarily second doses primarily first doses Sweden. worry unless also data says vaccines piling up. Rare understatement... *""after 177 million total Pfizer doses given out, 283 inflammation cases reported.""* wife myocarditis 8 weeks. went away. Pfizer. also fibromyalgia getting shot Covid twice last year. Fiji rough shape. We're ranked #3 worldwide cases per 100k, almost cases capitol 1/3 total population, Suva could worst verifiable outbreak planet. government stubbornly refuses lockdown, going jab way Astrazeneca, 16 week lag time vaccination. 6% target population fully vaccinated, they're forcing everyone work normal feed themselves. latest jab job talk pure desperation. Fijian rugby team lost game refusing wear jerseys said #vaccinatefiji, apparently share view people think inhaling steam boiling water lime garlic good covid treatment. speech prime minister mandated vaccines, claim microchip, magnetism, mark beast. drink water. hit cars 3 separate occasions (ADHD :D), walk away problem. said recommend it.

Update: second dose arrival 130k+ doses. *pretends shocked*  even 600,000 likely low-ball estimate ""The key maintain healthy diet strong immune system!"" 
*chomps burger* Thanks getting think again. people definitely rock hard place.  “Oh wanna get fake vaccine fake pandemic? Well better show tomorrow next day matter bad feel, you’re easily replaced.”

I don’t know answer is; want mandatory sick leave, works labor laws followed. don’t begrudge undocumented people work, either, I’m acknowledging it’s shit situation around. They’re releasing another shot variant booster shot know interpret data Italy. Overall administered doses fairly constant 500-550k/day, new first doses plummeting like rock (down 100k/day).

I think might consequence fact 4 weeks ago situation exactly opposite first doses all-time high, reserve capacity second dose people (me included). certainly hope people stopped signing it, since first doses we're still barely 70% adult population. scientists agree Twitter note CDC guideline beginning pandemic also wear masks. want I'm going blame folks going extra mile. Seriously! sit awake 4:30am Reddit. 😜 fell asleep earlier hours insomnia. 

Definitely important try keep regular schedule. (It’s easier said dine sometimes…but important least strive for.) see trust something like statement rather anything comes centre days war far over.

CDCs fault. People needed rewarded getting vaccinated let's tell everyone drop public health orders. Extremely premature. US heads pandemic almost over, ever get people listen abide restrictions? feel many mixed messages leadership, cycle years. like article says, vaccines enough save us variants. combination vaccines, masks, distancing, restricting social gatherings, unfortunately lockdowns needed. I'm sure work going forward, polarized climate. ask currently think best days behind us.

Another one, sick mother, said survive pandemic herbs. Really sad.  sure we’ll see much improvement front - pre-symptomatic period may shorter people eventually develop symptoms, people (especially vaccinated people) may stay mild/asymptomatic whole time never notice it. magic shot could keep happening! I've removed line taken issue with, though I'm going keep eye subject. think it’s made claim lifelong antibodies without context credible source. pressed said research lets people know probably don’t credible source. peer reviewed study scientific journals would wonderful start. indeed know lifelong antibodies, would helpful everyone point source better informed. nice day. Active cases awful indicator lag data, depends recovery defined, different everywhere. 

Still, 125k active cases monstrous number. Ontario, Canada we're 2000 active cases. 

There's also fact nobody even trusts numbers coming Florida, exactly stellar record data transparency. 

Delta real deal though. track closely here, able bypass vaccines better, spreads like absolute wildfire within unvaccinated population. 

A much higher vaccine percentage required herd immunity delta  Actually, agree points put wider context daily life rather feeling hard done can't go clubbing Right? Especially since earlier numbers alpha variant low Make mandatory everyone vaccination passport, that’s best way forward. Don’t get vaccination, barred society. I'd fine wrong here. want consume nothing else. Meanwhile, Pfizer indicates full vaccination starts diminish significantly six months. Or, listened CDC, ditched masks, went lives appropriately. saying acted irresponsibly? 37% deaths fully vaxxed?! Wow, that's terrible. 0.3% close contacts get infected asymptomatic person, number 10x higher someone symptomatic.

It’s known long time pandemic presymptomatic people spread virus quite bit, asymptomatic people much.

They tried cholesterol, took 6 months eating better fix issue. Doctor happy push pills though. ""shows working"" &lt; Narrative This!!   Less tinfoily theory: things already started open back up. People good idea goal was. Scientists telling everyone ""just get vaccine go back normal"".

Then comes along like cant change momentum. lock things again, there's unvaccinated people see reason get vaccinated. Also, us listened, erodes trust scientists went back forth advice.

I hope better contact tracing tracking this. stopped wearing mask myself.

I also find odd see 2 headlines here; one saying current vaccines protect delta variant, another saying certain vaccines protect it. explained well u/evanc3 true. Viruses evolve become virulent documented cases happening human history. Spanish flu one example h1n1 became virulent enough humans cause pandemic. examples well, Zika, hepatitis B, etc. fully vaccinated. slight concern spreading unvaccinated house members, I'd comfortable hopping mosh pit 5000 person indoor venuen without mask. fact people concerned go gym fully vaccinated boggles freaking mind point think either trolling incapable reading data shows safe would be. Let’s go FL summer vacation … said sane person 2021. No. remember would say Belgium first months pandemic overcounting, year numbers slightly undercounted too

More anything else, probable real number deaths least double, 8 million upwards  really. Lots getting vaccinated don’t trust Putin’s government. Russians “better devil know” mentality doesn’t mean actively support Putin.   Covid long hauler symptoms like 30% cases. Flu long hauler symptoms orders magnitude less   Here’s concern: common younger men boys, age say 10 years old data limited. healthy boy say 8 years old low risk dying Covid, may even vulnerable myocarditis. realize risk low, healthy kid risk also low possibly lower dying Covid. important question risk healthy child dying inflammation versus dying Covid. guesses, I’d like see actual numbers based relevant data. get covid top 90000000 side effects, people freaking tho. roommate refusing get second shot “until know more” ALREADY KNOW COMMON SIDE EFFECT SICK it’s lmao, show one study number anywhere near 60% Pfizer delta Israel one flawed. Confused comment. Get vaccinated. 391 families US alone lost child covid might beg differ don’t need worry kids. Sure, it’s great adults vaccinated. It’s great kids lower risk death. kids catch other. I’m elementary teacher dealt cluster among students school March. know kids develop long covid rare cases die, know it’s perfectly possible run successful classes masks year. it’s complete brainer require masks get vaccinated. friend got vaccinated Pfizer COVID. he’s well. symptoms all. don’t still predict non vaccinated contract virus die higher numbers vaccinated. 

So it’s still win science fact science deniers. 

If public list deniers could able run bingo game sorts.

Also I’m fed trying convince them.
Now default comment majority theirs.

“You’ve added list people helping solution climate change. name added list people willing remove humanity’s gene pool. List shared hospital staff would ease minds strain medical resources . Thank service.”  said vaccinated fine, it’s unvaccinated problems. scenario still mask mandate. vaccinated don’t need unvaccinated adults weren’t wearing begin with. would hope parents unvaccinated children wouldn’t need official mandate tell child wear mask get shot. 

So would mask mandate do? moved back Colorado four year tour Texas months pandemic hit. Best decision ever made. dont ask people reporting this, post part investigations done regelatory services. not, number reported default True, I'll give portion Long Covid somebody else. better expected news. “Just much” sounds like huge stretch. reference? “Just much” sounds like huge stretch. reference?   crock bullshit know it.

Teacher here, agree want back normal classes. going stay mask debate support whatever district decides. However, 5 days week students schools, returning normal instruction needs occur.  No, J&amp;J supposed 70% efficacy severe covid, that’s regular covid delta. It’s shit vaccine really don’t get counts vaccinated.  made snort laugh scare cat, so…your attempt successful! people saying ""these vaccines tested enough yet"" (despite billion vaccinated people now) say COVID ""just like flu"" long COVID...hasn't tested enough yet. No, J&amp;J supposed 70% efficacy severe covid, that’s regular covid delta. It’s shit vaccine really don’t get counts vaccinated. people US fully vaccinated…. half country fully vaccinated

Not quite. I'm trouble finding non-paywalled article link, according Google, 47.7% Americans fully vaccinated two days ago. Fosun it’s same, X billion $ goes BionTech Pfizer. :( Florida? Florida Illinois close vaccination rate nobody brings Illinois. Maybe it’s time acknowledge unvaccinated people caricatures Trump idiots Yeah letting virus go rampant, despite low hospitalizations might stupid...   I’m saying give people benefit doubt. technically wasn’t diagnosed, doctor agrees likely myocarditis. It’s pretty obvious heart inflammation tbh fact trending disturbing. Rogan tool. Karens Brads must taking ashyleighy, eestin, brayydin vacation No. cite sources Yeah man, makes total sense. 3 people affected super super super rare event coincidently visit post decide comment it.

(USA) anyone starting get sinking feeling public sentiment US starting shift towards lockdown again? I'm fully vaccinated I'm comfortable moving pandemic, think anti vaxxers actually big concern, they're mostly threat (dying vaccinated rare), can't say others. people know talking still feel safe large crowds think offer can't get everyone vaccinated. speak wanting return work office trust others vaccinated, without realizing vaccine protect regardless. Plus knew pandemic locking us last year music festivals started cancelling, I'm seeing increasing number cancellations entertainment industry already fall. 

Is anyone else growing concern, unfounded anxiety?   Calgary done nutshell, oh gone ahead Stampede Super Spreader event. long conforming KN95s, fine. Israel reporting vaccines dropping efficacy Delta variant  Yes, take vaccine. 

Your body's immune response COVID-19 start fade 3-4 months (varies depending health bad infection was). protection vaccine last much longer.  u  COVID-19 clinical update #70, Daniel Griffin discusses efficacy portable air cleaners, vaccine induce serum neutralizing antibodies variants, prevention attenuation disease mRNA vaccines, ivermectin prevent hospitalization, IL-6 antagonists mortality, impact vaccination long COVID.  Great, anti vax reason complain vaccine working. Sucks guy though. Hope gets better without much complications. yo got second dose yesterday nurse told age sex group could happens rare much risk, male late 20. title kinda blow proportion.

i told look signs
chest pain pain throat Correct. close entire economy every year flu. Bruh there's pool parties, raves concerts Wuhan since last May, even May 2021 May 2020.

If anyone believes China somehow secretly hiding massive covid waves, need get two remaining brain cells checked. I’m necessarily concerned media over-exaggerate it; I’m concerned information circulate around social media. think we’re well aware people read past headlines, (and assume many others) feel need repeatedly clarify. shouldn’t disregard data, also give appropriate weight risk-benefit analysis. 

Me personally? think important consideration acknowledge increases risk associated taking vaccine. also think benefits receiving vaccine even close eclipsed potential risks given severity frequency general population. worry people less informed fence getting vaccine use data excuse avoid without fully understanding true risk. 

It’s belief path forward managing virus mass vaccination, need proceed cooperative manner, meaning many people people need get board. Vaccine hesitancy detrimental general populace prolonging problems facing respect virus, though certainly understand people hesitant, don’t necessarily blame people feeling way. hope people become accurately educated true risks benefits, think media must proceed responsibly putting new data perspective. Yea knew rules. still allowed use it. much. That’s limit. nfl change josh Gordon. still kept failing drug test. know rules break ways. getting ousted? heart sinks (UK) leaders talk personal responsibility. leave people's individual judgement get train wreck. Correct. close entire economy every year flu. Well virus even ""mild"" cases causing erectile dysfunction viagra can't touch.  


Maybe important enough address  Well third fourth got Pfizer  Can’t change mind worried kids. point data showing rare serious them. remember super contagious doesn’t translate super deadly. something changes virus eludes vaccines, it’s unlikely mutate something dangerous. offered health officials? health regulators country advise, reviewed relevant studies data. People can’t many care themselves. Ah yes, wild celebrations last 16 defeat Czech Republic...  Sorry hear analogy didn’t make sense you. 
It perfectly relevant talking - didn’t make sense? 

Please share inventor mRNA tech shared info. 
Also, I’ll remain doubtful single person created base tech. mean, saying literally statistical fact. can't blame people dumb. I'm even downplaying COVID, I'm saying, also care countless things kill Americans every day? visited Colorado ago it’s 5 year plan move Texas. Better hope vaccination numbers outpace virus  fair keep insisting vaccinated people play rules low risk.

First all, game ""playing.""  Millions dying. escaped fate far, that's true isn't. 

Secondly, also insist sober careful drivers play traffic rules driving drunks idiots, despite much lower chance accident. That's ""not fair"", either. would sure lot fun us careful drivers could ignore traffic lights stop signs, speed feel like it, drive side road! However, consistent uniformly-enforced rules vital dangerous environment, even people need others. UAB strong hospital system, know. influence extend trailer parks, unfortunately. Around 93% COVID-19 cases recent days occurred counties vaccination rates less 40%, U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention director Rochelle Walensky told media Preliminary data recent months suggest 99.5% COVID-19 deaths occurred unvaccinated people, You, don’t understand article saying Thanks! Appreciate taking time post this. danger asking many times, **really** need it, nobody listens anymore. far I'm concerned vaccine now. means people want get vaccine can. choose get vaccinated that's you. shutting country Nah, catching covid-19 naturally way go.

They choosing, That's abundantly clear completely incorrect state that. wrong information. matter article about. go around stating completely wrong information. I’ve gotten Myocarditis before. Actually Myopericardits, that’s semantics. Anyways vomited, developed cough, severe chest pain, got mild heart damage. definitely extreme case though hospitalized 5 days, lot people don’t even need hospitalization. really wish never dropped mask rule stupid.......  Hi,

Does anyone links studies show outcomes twice-vaccinated people (AstraZeneca) aged 50-60 type 2 diabetes catching Delta variant? 

I'd like know expect. Someone household caught COVID we're debating whether keep prisoner bedroom isolation period, allow mingle rest (vaccinated) house self-isolate.

However, I'm sure risks person (once classified vulnerable due diabetes) they're vaccinated. Good news  lol. Shut up. voted moron passed laws preventing putting prevention control methods back place. Vaccinations control works elected leaders made sure control allowed Florida. Mate corrupt slime ball people like support encouraging behaviour  People look south, see US they’re wide open consequences. know know! natural link theory doesn’t contradict lab origin theory. 

Given lack evidence pointing one way other, possible theory COVID-19 natural virus (not human engineered), jumped animal human natural manner. 

It’s also possible point transmission occurred lab setting.  Ugh imagine really amount people getting tested. scary. know said randomly anyway  oblivious irony bet? food industry called HACCP (now) HARPC.

And love section Malcolm Gladwell book illustrates many things go wrong, average, airplane crashes. Florida get memo? COVID over, 2020 thing /s state criticism Trump?  Given context thread, abundantly clear saying “preventing COVID” meant “preventing COVID hospitalizations”

Pretending otherwise obtuse. all. Vaccinated people won’t support restrictions outside major change like big increase number children getting seriously ill large numbers breakthrough cases flooding hospitals. Unvaccinated people never supported restrictions anyway part.

Very places US even real lockdown. I’m worried happening worth, doctors org see huge difference various vaccines. believe generally effective one another.

Disclaimer: doctor. giving medical advice. got first two shots early late February. went got 3rd shot last week. FDA approve (or I’ve read — sounds like Fall). live terrible state delta surging. (Second highest USA). ZERO side effects. lie pharmacist saying wasn’t vaccinated yet made sure since received Pfizer first time, got Pfizer again. didn’t want mix/match. Like said sure won’t popular desperate times calls desperate measures. figured effects covid would worse vaccinating. huge issue delta variant change symptoms. UK we're finding prominent symptoms - sore throat, runny nose headache.  

So basically similar cold/hayfever.  

If delta variant gets in, going get unvaccinated - finding UK. Clubs still closed Canada we’re 50% fully vaccinated 80% one dose. always assumed Europeans would even cautious Canadians! Yep. human body indefinitely kept producing antibodies every virus ever encountered, average human's blood would probably sludge time hit age 20. infection cleared body winds production antibody infection.

For long term (potentially lifetime) immunity pathogen, human body creates [Memory B remember pathogen allow immune system rapidly respond reinfection. unfortunate truth. could mandated, noooooo outcry, inhumanity. Fucking damn hate people much. concerning part this: FL’s vaccination rate essentially national average. 

Thus, could signal country large face. tragic part it’s preventable. 

If there’s silver lining, it’s senior tend vaccinated demographic, case fatality rate good deal lower previous waves. still… great EMA says, 177 million total Pfizer doses given out, 283 inflammation cases 20 million Moderna doses, 38 inflammation cases reported.

Take shot. Weird considering numerous people thread said mild cases it. I’m assuming it’s much higher 283 depends. 

If, say, 60% people vaccinated vaccines 90% effective deaths, see deaths vaccinated unvaccinated people. That's basic, normal maths.  posting good faith change mind.

Stop it.

Also: source? Ahem, shall Florian state anthem. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  article makes wrong assumption deaths metric care covid.

We desperately need data long covid resistant vaccinated people it.

Seems setting generation disabled people potentially.  know anti vaxxers spend every weekend binge drinking sniffing coke, obese, smoker, 0 exercise ......but ""ThE VaCcIne dAnGeroUs"" freely available vaccine months now. certain point let take risk. can't live lockdowns forever.  try piss employer wearing mask office even video calls. want us back office 2-3 days week starting next month.    sure funny people making lives discredit one best resources pandemic?

But you. Common root cause analysis across many industries. Taught pharmaceutical manufacturing deviation investigations. Disaster Princess.  find crazy, Canada we’re 50% fully vaccinated people still clamouring vaccines. US lucky immigrant travel heavy cities high vaccination rates protecting country Delta. countries like Poland Ukraine clubs open without ""vaccine passport"" two months cases still extremely low?
Vaccine passports complete crap vaccinated get, carry transfer virus.  worried be? live NYC. Cases plummeting due vaccination, getting sky high presumably due delta. But, hospitalizations deaths way down. I'm worried kids (under 12) fall. I'm glad northeast, yeah worried fall schools potential long term effects get (like shingles, since new one really knows happen later line). Nicht gut. hope still deaths hospitalisations *DO NOT* rise way. reason since second wave, Dutch always reported significantly less deaths hospitalisations compared number cases had, compared countries. become even extreme since last wave cases partially vaccinated population. Hopefully stays case, lot people vaccinated (81% adults partially 50% fully vaccinated). 

Last wave peak cases ~10,000 deaths ~20 per day. Currently 10,000 cases ~1 death per day. deaths always lag cases, peak cases much higher due less measures new variant much contagious. hand, lot people vaccinated infections almost completely concentrated among youth. extremely naive think world works like Sometimes bring child childcare go somewhere (like store). done curbside, cant afford time. I've inside year half now, vaccinated, work home 18 month old. go back work person August choice put daycare. someone looks says ""zero reason"" wish could walk day shoes. I'm doctor either think correct decision. wait experts approve it? going get shot every 6 months? Right you. :-) ""Our rights don’t get completely scrapped there’s virus.""

They didn't, ya doofus. dramatic. Nearly every precious right preserved. asked people change behavior, temporarily, protect other. things like businesses forced shut down, blows, that's risk take business owner. go back one worst periods don’t. 

Yes do.

It numbers say. worst period COVID Florida January. that's time new infection rate reached near 10,000 per day. much nearer peak February, March, April, May, regards 7-day average? No.

Not sure ""no"" means here.  said correct. terms infection rate bad Feb -through June now. 7-day average never came 10,000 Feb -through June.

What purpose no, July’s current 7-day average 3,300/day nearer February, March, April, May.

I'm talking newest rates spiked alternate days. 7 day average wait another 6 13 days...

But July 9 July 7th daily rate spiked.

Does word ""spike"" make sense? Britain higher vaccination levels. There's probably higher level natural immunity well.

Britain's R-number 1.3, even fairly moderate difference number immune people would lead different level growth Netherlands. friendly suggestion. Certain places suitable people get better following orders trust aspects life pure moral entities like government yeah dude know Honestly anyone works kids isn’t vaccinated horrible person. It’s kid’s fault vaccine isn’t approved them; they’re totally reliant us protect them. Granted they’re exceptionally low risk COVID still. vote counts.

I’ll little paranoid next weeks. personally think slow week, least known infections simple reason: less events need test = less testing.

*yikes*    live florida. know people currently sick COVID. 30s one sick enough hospitalized. friend mine lost cousin, refused vaccinated, COVID couple weeks ago. 40s.

Particularly considering early hotspot. exactly point variant considered broken vaccines? vaccines 0% efficacy? vaccines less 60% efficacy? makers Swiss cheese Or, know, let people make choices. gets COVID decided take chances.

What immune compromised need stop reporting numbers, everyone needs start refusing COVID measures.

Sorry worst possible response possible.  VaaS disagree... 

The semantics origins virus still add up.... main reason Wuhan sort place viruses emerge naturally from. literally city. Also, lot publications keep repeating falsehood Huannan market sold wild animals. not.. sold mostly seafood, literally wet market. 

Aquatic animals even ACE2 receptor none tested positive virus time. fact winter China November 2019. There's many reasons reasoning work. viruses emerged zoonotically meaning one done also straw man argument make. 

It possible emerged naturally particular reasoning/timeline explanation bollocks. Gottlieb discusses delta variants questions vaccines.

Despite mild issues, would 1000% get vaccine to, worth help keep family safe! Oh accuracy! suspect largely irrational, political reasons.

Because way public discourse works (or rather, fails work) today, merely acknowledging idea strong natural immunity potentially lead people accusing pursuing herd immunity strategy following footsteps \[insert controversial political leader\]. similar phenomenon last year, period became taboo acknowledge greater testing leads higher reported cases, simply certain American public figure said that.

The ""logic"" seems someone uses certain fact order argue bad policy, anyone else states fact also trying argue policy.   We’ll variants quite ashamed age group, act like never partied before.

This excuse.   article provides additional information. pointed - go CDC definitive information. 

1) two 10 regions CDC monitors—one covering Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah Wyoming—the Delta variant already accounts 80.7% 74.3% cases respectively.

2) Delta driven wave new infections among unvaccinated groups highly vaccinated countries—notably children young people

3) Vaccines appear effective preventing serious disease Delta, coverage uneven, uptake falling hesitancy remains high, with

And vaccination rates continue fall leave U.S. dangerously vulnerable new outbreaks Covid-19, polling Kaiser Family Foundation reveals groups resist vaccines most—Republicans, Evangelicals, young people lead—and why, though reasons stand scrutiny. KFF poll, conducted Jun. 8-21, found Republicans (52%), uninsured 65s (48%), white Evangelical christians (58%), young people aged 18-29 (55%) living rural areas (54%) groups lowest vaccination rates.  plenty facts plenty evidence.

California still going require masks everyone think California got right time best way protect school kids COVID-19.

First, going kids seen Trump influencers running around without masks who'll question need wear masks get vaccinated (ignoring fact Trump got very, sick COVID-19 refused wear mask, plus later quietly got vaccinated).

Second, two groups students, masked unmasked, masked students basically signaling everyone parents anti-vax, anti-mask likely strongly conservatives.

Or likely large cohort unvaxxed students also refusing wear masks. guarantee lots schools sources COVID-19 outbreaks Fall. I’m CA vocal parent group advocating masks optional  dumbest spin I've ever heard I've Reddit years. getting vaccinated unethical. get everyone seems blame government something like happens. Sure, might wisest decisions lift restrictions situation like this.

But people capable thinking themselves, assess situation rationally, take (or avoid taking) action accordingly?

Just government lifts restrictions mean act pandemic suddenly over. fact, shouldn't, need come conclusion common sense.

So IMHO people start taking personal responsibility, would help way anything government does. risk holidays factor decision bring back restrictions, said, adding hoped EU countries would look hospital admissions rather infection rates deciding Dutch face quarantine extra tests.

Why hell hospital numbers Netherlands matter countries? super ill people hospitals travel countries. infect people outside Netherlands. People Covid mild symptoms stay home bigger risk. know Delta \*is\* speedier, much like Aussie reports infection 'fleeting contact', prior variants generally thing. much testing? Nepal Delta Delta+ dominates. think J&amp;J trick. hospitals overwelmed sanity rules forced isolations (of personel patients) first place, shear numbers patients vax prevents hospitalization/serious illness 93-97% infections.

That's efficacy serious illness calculated. based total reduction vs. unvaccinated group, protection infection significant part that. 90% effective vaccine that's 95% effective preventing hospitalization, % infections end hospital would 50% lower among vaccinated population, things equal.

And course still lot unvaccinated people susceptible severe disease ever were, take hospital beds like anyone else. actually providing education children **Among 61 child deaths linked pos­i­tive Covid-19 test Eng­land, 25 ac­tu­ally caused ill­ness, study found.**

Hey look, over-counted COVID deaths. unvaccinated idiots regression thing keeping kids school long term consequences. Almost entire rest world prioritized person learning.  many vaccine refusers, many opportunity get vaccinated? interesting. One thing wonder whether idea yet long booster would last, whether think booster going every-six-months deal one-time thing.

Of course one big worries whole pandemic long immunity lasts general. seen lot serious reinfections know of, still early. Still, may start learning whether vaccine immunity different better natural immunity.

And course big question: much care stopping mild COVID? get past Delta surge, may become fundamental question everything vaccine boosters vaccines kids. virus deadly forced take cure. actually want educate children disastrous 18 months education Well that’s sue malpractice. come back later sue real already know done. tried look weekly report. Saw 0 new cases couple counties, suspect. Mask use also dramatically different 3 countries Thats ""insert arbitrair distance"" Social diatancing rules didnt make sense start with. Either everyone stays home point less. Ventilation key. spread outside. Mask point less aërosols. tell years probably rather chance spreading others though. lot long covid patients mild symptoms period positive. Meaning young people dramatically lower risk long covid lot people report side effects coming 12 hours shot. me, Moderna, sore arm 4 hours first shot lasted days. second, got real tired 4 hours in, slept 8 hours, woke flu like symptoms lasted 36 hours. results almost definitely vary. Whoa! state something good once!! Thanks, Gov. Ron. Thank pointing out! came really fast. updated comment include link recent info. Hospitalizations thing that's important. Higher infection rates consequences. Avoidable consequences  ever see buttigieg think shadow app. better get approved need it? He's zero covid moron train thought flu vaccine allergies due cultured egg proteins. could sworn read something sub months ago suggested allergies mRNA vaccines far rare common contraindications (egg allergies fairly common, i.e. uncommon ones).

From I've read common reason vaccinated actually simply expected work (i.e. chemo, certain immunosuppresents) concern partial reaction could worse. like end pandemic Netherlands officially willfully postponed least 2 months government Everyone right decide done body. That's inviolable me.

However others also right expect reasonable protection unvaccinated people. least still got protection. would serious without What’s now? called dissent pin you’re you’re supposed (getting vaccinated)? misunderstanding? want single agree said, makes people sub think Vietnam honest China size outbreak there? kind ""plucky underdog"" reputation?

It's one-party state ranked 175th 180 press freedom (only two places higher China).

It's interesting see since start pandemic, sub incredibly sceptical Russian statistics, fairy sceptical Chinese statistics (although there's definite pro-China astroturfing), almost universally trusting Vietnam's statistics, actually implausible three. early days, also pretty hilarious comparisons Vietnam war. good news is, number hospitalized people still (for now, remind 2 weeks) going down. Also good note is, 2 times number tests done, number cases didnt double. average positive case per test still went said ""But that's completely different topic section about""...

nvm, :wave: county legitimately one best country terms vaccinations 80% adults least one dose.

Our cases quadrupled last 10 days, last week showing decent increase percentage. mean we're like 2,000 cases day? No, went 17 68. BUT, fact seeing 0.3% positivity rate back 1%+ really annoying bit concerning means shit way assume.

My hope always ""Get cases minimal anything bad happened, would take time things get crazy."" Well got close never really hit that, variant gonna make things way cautious. spreading like even countries best vaccination rates world. absolute bugger variant find way unvaccinated single dose vaccinated crack can, whether that's children young, low risk people got turn gotten around yet, genuine anti vax people.

 levels got high UK even started hearing stories double vaxxed people testing positive--the vaccines excellent breakthrough cases seem low symptoms, even 5% 10% people still catch vaccination, covid EVERYWHERE, that's going amount fair few. look UK stats, death rate MASSIVELY lower would without vaccines (last time case rate 7 day average rising getting 30-40 0 deaths day, right we're getting tenth that). States good vaccination rates still see delta take primary variant may see temporary case spikes, I'm confident states anything can't cope with. I'm much worried areas low rates, though. one must spread like *wildfire* low vax population. haven’t seen exponential growth used while. Nice see it’s making comeback.  Nobody used term “scientific consensus” except you. And, definition, it’s general agreement given time *most* scientists doesn’t require unanimous agreement. random dentist Kansas doesn’t like vaccines doesnt affect that. But, again, said dentists therapists considered virology experts...because they’re not. I’m thinking well. would’ve fired getting flu vaccine every year. hope Covid vaccine it’s fully approved. vaccine dramatically reduce likelihood catch, incubate shed significant amount virus.  Smart choice   WTF! serious?!!!!!! might could became mandated vaccine wear mask, someone disregarded it. Also blaming everything bars clubs ridiculous, correlation equal causation, bars, clubs festivals US countries month without spike cases, hand places things yet open (the UK example) seen spikes well. true people get vaccinated also catch virus get immunity old-fashioned way.

(spoiler: lot going catch virus get immunity old-fashioned way)  Correct lol. Remember: idiot like wait vaccine  think I'm clear side affects 5 hours first Pfizer shot? Finally got around getting shot got sweaty light headed within 10 minutes shot. stayed 25 minutes pharmacist could monitor me. gave bottle water got better think hot building mom said hot getting shot. Also got home back normal. think may psychosomatic could well side effects. Okay great rest day ex-gf spent year front lines: moon-suit ICU, N95 mask welts face, putting people body bags. can’t imagine through. got vaxxed December last year, says relief palpable, year wondering whether job going kill her. illusions this.

The fact many people get nursing school still heads full ludicrous bullshit makes wonder teach nursing school. germ theory disease controversial there? Sheesh £9.40 drugs discharged hospital. (If job). Covid vaccines CRT. Haha means military members inoculated directly CRT first time history!! Yeah, leaders capitalism world. (Sorry, commenting USA vs rest world healthcare system, phrase ""Capitalism sucks"" hurts lot communism killed members family. )

&amp;#x200B;

edit: holy fuck i'm jumpy touchy today. agree CDCs data works way around. start serious breakthrough cases sees data common. None serious cases aka requiring medical care irrelevant vaccines Humans social creatures require regular doses face-to-face interactions order remain mentally healthy. especially true formative years. enormous body research regarding effects prolonged social isolation children young adults. 

It possible, although still unproven, Covid may negative long term effects children. However, long term negative effect social isolation long proven well known. 

I understand decision risk known, provable harm order avoid possible, unproven harm. think reference COVID itself, vaccine see one listed examples oldest post related SARS1 infection BSL-4 P4 lab Taiwan?

Point say accidents happen, even best labs around world. Interesting! always toght 5 days really common apparatenly variance then! suprised got symtoms early 100% knew caught it. Prove it. definitely true experience. think USA leads respects I'd rather take chances UK's NHS, based read reddit. possible confirmed adverse effects associated COVID yet media prominent health officials would rather harp deaths associated still pretty low younger demographic thus giving impression vaccine similar/higher risk catching COVID group

Get Vaccinated, deaths/hospitalizations factor worry comes COVID. Don’t let idiot Anti-Vaxxers tell otherwise Yeah, maybe something like vaccine, sick pay. True. admit there’s difference vaccinated supporting openly. never supported aside taking credit it. knew gotten Moderna. FML.  Unless live say UK $0. Yeah, who's approving textbooks? 5040 Blimey Well, believe mistaken scientific consensus regarding taking care covid start. opposing voices raising concerns, blanket statements almost never correct.

The main crux never said one thing vaccines though, one (primarily because... I'm covid vaccines... ) . however strongly misuse term scientific consensus. believe grave damage done institutional science 2020/2021. that's completely different topic section about.

Anyway, might make laugh, conversation reminded right move  I’m going trust CDC’s data. trust Facebooks ""According latest figures provided federal health department, 3.2m doses Pfizer administered, 5m doses AstraZeneca.

However, many doses – 16.6m – “cleared” Therapeutic Goods Administration distribution.

Of these, 12.3m distributed clinics use, 620,000 doses AstraZeneca sent Timor-Leste Pacific nations. health department says 2.3m doses AstraZeneca held contingency cover second dose allocations.

That leaves 1.4m doses presumably distributed.""

Based number vaccines administered date size population, Australia enough vaccine *right now* give one shot entire adult population (my rough calculations 18-19 million adult Australians). first dose policy worked Canada. need holdback $2.3 million AstraZeneca doses contingency - put arms right now. I've seen sides, people keep pushing vaccines 100% people freaking not. think fact is, vaccine world 100%, exception. live certain level risk every year always been, even COVID. want say COVID flu let's honest, bad flu year kill tens thousands barely us think it. many doctors died, many nurses lose? Uhhh maybe unvaccinated (adults) keeping virus around antibodies vaccine start wane us vaccinated vulnerable. people pay delivered could get real thing now...for free   NSW 33% Australian population.

That’s like saying “don’t lump Australia Australia”. Yes, family proud. Yes, requirement least Japan got plenty vaccine, Japanese willing vaccinate.   UK seeing daily cases 20-30k range daily deaths ~25. compared last time seeing 25-30k cases per day deaths 400-500 per day.

If Netherlands used vaccine UK imagine trends look similar. High cases counts hopefully (relatively) low daily death rate.   17 tested positive concert  plenty people choose stupid ignorance. simple visit many anti-vaxxers groups Facebook show so.

""Stupid people born stupid"" dumbest thing I've heard awhile. wonder defending them. 

There people born many forms autism incapable discerning things. we're talking here. I'm talking idiots dying daily choice many instances killed others around them.

The cat bag one going back.  Vaccinated South Carolinian here. shocked US shipping 4M doses Moderna I’ve surprised protest hasn’t coming Australia policies. Maybe we’re going need booster shots sooner later right CDC?  willingly expose large viral loads Covid, vaccinated not. Particularly variants. 

If going hospital, there's good chance running 100, right? immune system might poorly thanks surgery, infection issue. run risk? Especially to. 

It's unnecessary risk literally zero payoff.   hope two half weeks go very, well easy soon feeling better. also hope mom hard thinking behavior. hope test comes back negative.

What absolutely mind bendingly ridiculous notion. also tell mechanic needs donate six months paycheck every time suggests repair? many families outside Australia watched family members die can't leave country near dear. 

I've lived US Australia Australians come across isolationist average assume background, culture lives everyone living land close majority i.e white, Anglo, multi generational Aussie connections outside island.

Not US noble anything even would consider traditionally ally (left leaning, inner city dwelling Australians) much ally cause. book became “I Legend” also basis “Omega Man”, double clever! know are, think argument Europe ""hold opening everyone chance get vax'd"". 

Here US opened somewhat early (late May - mid Jun smart states), cases generally lower back everyone chance get vaccine. 

But yea agree everyone chance get vax'd going lock downs make sense since probably going go away. mention loss confidence public health officials flipfloping. It’s simple don’t want vaccine fucking quit holy shit. people need vaccines jobs safely. It’s literally public safety issue. issue get COVID see strong immune system is. Good luck  Americans dumb. I'm American say that. I'm one dumb ones, I'm vaccinated Locked up? hospital jail.

Let's actually flesh scenario: I'm called car accident. Patient injured needs checked out, currently stable good vitals. En route start asking could please take hospital recently took number Hepatitis patients huge Hepatitis B outbreak nearby nursing home. ask they're vaccinated Hepatitis B say - want place greater risk contracting Hep B.

First all, could risk losing license knowingly purposefully expose patient preventable disease. delusions worth license.

Second going assume someone asking put danger either suffering TBI CVA. I'm going start neuro exam route notify hospital.

People knowingly put harms way well. give free money get it.  Cope. virus know country care either.  Naples also literally large city so-called ""open days"" could skip regular queue vaccines complete flop, whereas everywhere else ""sold out"" within seconds/minutes registrations opening. shit! months scientist mean ""stop""? ending guys.. chance eliminate covid. However viruses zoonotic easily pass one species next. You’re right viruses one. culled millions mink Europe Canada variant concerns. China 5-7 vaccines various stages trials/production. they'll flatten curve. unvaccinated people taking calculated risk

The people *can't* take vaccine probably disagreeing dichotomy. CDC's new guidelines new school year seem reasonable enough: fully vaccinated, need wear mask. aren't, should. Even better, sounds like restrictions may gradually loosened kids get vaccinated. Given vaccine kids likely ready September so, several months fall restriction finally disappears. think that's fair. know probably close hundred young man vaccinated issue. It’s risk high enough risk catching Delta probably likely cause heart issue. One dose effective stopping delta variant. That’s interesting statement since CDC stopped tracking breakthrough cases exactly you/we demonstrate true? fucked around. found out. agree could clearer, still think it’s correct is. Rarely see a/an first word headline. Ohio health OhioHealth. I’m upset healthcare spelled one word. **Jul. 10, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

High infection rates hurt us, means deaths sick people. Johnson unfit hold political power. Pfizer - zero side effects. 

It actually made worry ""Is working?!"" Yes please. clear herd immunity kicked yet. 

Or stop British people flying abroad. Everyday turn news see country getting covid cases incoming British flights. 

We 5% vaccination rate unfair suffering British people still know get sick even year paid government get sick. Nothing tens thousands paramedics nurses though? one that's mostly lacked access vaccines recently. mean schools colleges LA County? still open up?

They used animals North America have, fertilized feces. three-fields system NA (to best knowledge) never had, 

They need cover crops (100-200 years Columbus) 

North Americans using cover crops Europeans showed up. know sure long before, before. survived less productive cultures (maize **still** productive wheat, there's Indian magic it; potato). 

There's Indian magic? know anything saying? Wild corn garbage, little stupid corn things get Chinese food. corn actually eat bred native Americans worthwhile, really productive varieties need processed using chemicals sophisticated methods ""primitive"" native Americans figured even Mayans developed written language. Potatoes straight poison native Americans fixed them. know domesticated plants? Hm, good know... Oh, wait! Wheat, oats, barley, rye, turnip...

Sounds like need work increased vaccinations then. think may looking answers years come. 1 year booster? 5 year? New variants? would fine science does, changing, evolving, get used excuse discount entirely. 

And point much care mild covid vaccinated people...good thought. could live mild flu level covid. problem within US lots places 70% population willfully (mostly) unprotected risk serious illness death. rest world widespread vaccination could take years, new variants emerge, new shots needed, ad nauseam. actually true, germany, european countries:

The underlying problem quick, unreasonable openings. Dropping mask mandate inside, schools, totally neglecting unvaccinated group, artificially delaying hepa filters schools, dropping need test, controls whatsoever...

North Rhine-Westphalia jumping ahead (ofc) opening remaining restrictions areas like sport, night clubs, festivals, distancing, condact data (as done before), restrictions customers per area. 

All whilst numbers going again. So, underlying problem same: want much quick risk all. dutch ahead couple weeks. one head experts words, Wieler, President RKI wont stop upcoming autumn wave vaccinations alone. bad generalised article. Many parts Australia lived normal day day life continue vaccinated. Sure Brisbane short sharp lockdowns since large one large year world locked down. since quite okay. many parts Australia, lived normal life without lockdowns restrictions.   vaccine helps severe sickness. areas currently seeing surge low vaccination rates.

Yes work, good protection Delta variant. 

The problem unvaccinated folks keeping virus around longer have, becomes concern vaccinated people's protections start wane become vulnerable. Stagnant. since cases lower end spectrum, spike cause anything major yet anyway. need look next week.

The fact though, county vaccinated still seeing increase cases. concerning everyone. Yes thank you! everyone go get vaccine!  would take time things get crazy.

But hospital numbers looking like? stay home lockdowns simply cases, stop hospitals overrun. area high numbers vaccination, unlikely hospitalization numbers come anywhere near highs saw last year.

The areas high numbers unvaccinated, ones going real problems. irony tend chockful people complained COVID restrictions also refusing one thing would essentially guarantee return restrictions. sound like someone drank q coolaid. I’m fully vaccinated, think sister refused get vaccinated might COVID. worried? Again, wrong. generation that? definitely isn't. Good luck speedy recovery. symptoms beyond heart rate get tested? vaccine available everyone! I'd suggest getting Kansas. born raised never really took vacations anything. Well, made sudden guess spontaneous decision wife toddler move. 4 months I've absolute blessing!

P.S. Everyone know new state (AR) vaccinated too! Yeah, think Wallensky turn one villains piece look back year two now. 

After year struggle, made good strides establishing new social norms US wearing masks, operating businesses less full capacity, shutting certain dangerous venues. perfect means, tremendous progress made, kept lot people alive.

She basically pissed away week. everyone strutting around saying never wear mask going cruises bars.

Really tragic lame. Geez. assume looking new therapist them… exactly what's going happen delta variant over, yet idiots refuse get vaccinated, worried side effects, refuse wear masks areas vaccination rates 60% higher.

Experts estimate 50% LA county whole full vaccinated. millions living life like pre-pandemic spreading around.

There breakthrough cases, real concern time end severe symptoms. Hahaha! want personal scanner ping people check. live South. Sucks here. realise vaccine passports stop Covid spreading?  Please, go elsewhere. [Are sure  Yes, please include drivers/pilots/maritime workers even disembarking vehicles. though people Reddit making stuff state that? live California doubt state taken serious little mitigating spread seriously.. wearing mask hard easiest way protect everyone else. CDC drives insane they're getting better. Look Sydney (effectively unvaccinated) Delta variant putting 10% people hospital, even young people. Current rules August 13 time  Agree. would rather vaccine quarantine time. Louder. Say louder. get different therapist know CDC keeps telling people wear mask. even hard keeps people safe. Complete refusal take responsibility themselves. Fuck Rutte De Jonge. folk comes first others. know deep inside. It’s normal. need ashamed it.   like podcasts watched entire thing nothing asymptomatic spread There’s Supreme Court case says states mandate vaccinations. Jacobson v Massachusetts. That's fair point raise. US successful hurt. would free us provide aid abroad. course not. referring ""mark beast"". Like said, know situation imagine effects echo chamber telling get vaccinated go hell. Maybe social media even popular there, know. know sounds lot like what's happening US 5G Bill Gates crap. think social media plays big role spreading misinformation. people would love scenario happen would mean right people called stupid dead. Cuba serious medicine science. [14 med came [a cancer undergoing trials US. But... But... government told it!

_Proceeds drive red light_ Going door-to-door rural Missouri tell people get vaccinated job could pay enough do. (This considered, yet enforced) implemented, assume would abandoned like Israel’s Denmark’s passes. would highly enforced week two would quickly taper off. high vaccination percentage businesses would eventually assume patrons vaccinated anyway. think wanted large venues hospitality earlier year refused gave up. don’t see domestic passports useful anything international travel. people acting like delta threat vaccinated people?   sad. There’s also federal guidance government authority make vaccines mandatory all. Schools workplaces enforce either letting attend terminate employment, there’s precedent compel people get vaccine. use whatever excuse want. 44 states, religious exemptions. knows six states.

COVID made worthwhile spend R&amp;D technology improve/streamline it. Delta impact Australia - Sydney (5 million people) full lockdown 50 new cases today ~500 active cases overall. big impact young people too. Lots 40s hospital intensive care (vax available 40s yet). 

It get worse gets better us 8% 9% fully vaxed 25% - 30% one shot due Federal govt slow Pfizer roll lack trust AZ. Long covid lol getting desperate here. Life risks. Get it.  Comparative one shot vaccine, J&amp;J better them.  alberta. underestimate Europeans traveling. stupid green checkmark policies basically gives reason vaccinate. Netherlands really needs stop pretending know better everyone else.

I'm sorry grandfather. experts advised Trump original Covid-19 virus flu would go away?

There Covid-19 variants concern circulating delta lambda, could result lockdowns.   Welcome Dutch politics 101, want make everyone happy! Hmm, maybe that's might get rest people vaccinated... Roughly speaking, what’s probability testing positive COVID 48 hours exposure? Idk. GFs hospital made vaccines mandatory week email say point blank terminated comply. exceptions need reviewed board doctors. still lose University Michigan kinds laws protect common good, time make vaccinations mandatory common good.

Cowards find courage behind bars need to. point sheer cowardice get vaccinated enough data make educated decision.

Once pandemic over, mandatory vaccination law.

I HIV COPD belive understand worry vaccinations important here. individual effects countless others something like effects even yet born time grow balls, face enemy stop makeing excuses.

If vaccination kills years come, stops pandemic noble sacrifice make sake youth children come. let inherit this. point due failures supposed lead protect us, let's better supposed lead protect.

Get done. Ya know read vaccine testing works lol fucking typical covid denial bull shit Takeaway: monopolizing bad person responded saying vaccines prevented hospitalization 93-97% **infections**, correct. 93-97% reduction (and efficacy hospitalization discussed) *before* accounting infections. 

So group unvaccinated people 10K infections 500 hospitalizations, identical group vaccinated vaccine that's 90% effective 95% effective hospitalization, would expect 1K infections 25 hospitalizations latter group. 95% reduction hospitalization, look people infected, rate hospitalization per case would drop half (2.5% vaccinated vs 5% unvaccinated). know ethical issues involved vaccine passports vaccine mandates, also huge ethical issues massive restrictions everybody, appears likeliest alternative.

The survival live entertainment crucial; minor part life, know shut time cases start rise beyond certain level, can't survive. long herd immunity remains moving target, see alternative something like this. Really bad idea 🤣  Guess I'll saving alot money then! business' business know vaccination status I've doses. People surely arms kinda thing, people aiding pandemic long. Like, claim ""your right/choice"" get vaccinated, everyone else able keep far away crowds possible.

US venues too. There’s proof it’s inferior, actually seems holding better variants real! I'm glad I'm crucified referring native American friends preferred term w/o internet warriors judging me. Language evolves totally right.  ensure take Pfizer vaccine you’ll need take Pfizer product rest life… Pillory stocks, [like Definitely doesn’t hurt 😁 offers protection half time doesn’t require strict storage conditions… sure I’d call inferior.

Still waiting study [this published. I’m pretty sure federal level there’s nothing says exempt people based religion.

On personal note father idiot posting sharing stupid shit covid vaccines FB, got severe covid beginning year almost killed wife. still posts stupid shit hate it. would never want laws shut stupid ass up. way dangerous lying scumbag politician kind power father idiot FB. remember far people history race died democide i.e. hands government. I’m 100%. virtual learning last year, continue truly safe return person. It’s weird lax people regards children. don’t care it’s smallest percent chance son getting severe case COVID, it’s worth risking. virus still unknown news changes regularly learn it. refuse let 9 year old guinea pig this. I'm sorry facts effect you. around lots unvaccinated children? I'm sorry like facts. Cut gaslighting. think bring awkward, smoking: made prevention campaigns featured impotence, would \*at least\* effective ones highlighted death. process makes everyone super angry. 

Up pretty pleased Dutch government handled crisis. Always pretty firm restrictions, keeping things normal possible. last reopening, however, bad gamble hindsight. Opening things like clubs least linked goal posts like instance “75% fully vaccinated 18-30 year olds” Meanwhile Earth One...   It’s sort dumb decision. One shot Janssen doesn’t seem protect one shot Pfizer. It’s like it’s magically making perfectly protected one shot - approved used one dose regimen, unlike brands. They’ve saying since beginning.

But keep mind obesity also causes impotence. I’d bet way people erection issues due fat covid. People don’t care. I’d want that. could verified court law someone purposely spreading disinformation, would love punishments behind I'm shocked stupidity. even case, guarantee wave give immunity protect new wave new variant. Vaccination gives seemingly better immunity least closure gives every adult time get fully vaccinated. 

The closure 14th August, random date - date fully vaccinated sign first dose today. (Same day first doses starting available many locations Netherlands) walked press conference holding burlap sack dollar sign wasn’t antivax ….. procrastinating. 

I’m honestly put situation… dude didn’t listen mother, listens me. one find locations get jabbed. average pretty high older people USA: 85% nationally, right regions quite low.

The Delta variation seems mostly going unvaccinated older people middle aged unvaccinated people. Someone went high school 90s (so he's 45 like me) seriously ill hospital instance. I'm sorry friends. hope remain well. Mine remote thrived. Yes missed social interactions, learned year years past. school focused excellent job. kids got together weekly without teachers really fun together. think ton people underestimate resilient children are.

The biggest problem remote learning children great situations home. US thing. We’re devoting enough resources vaccinate people, monitor disease, respond outbreaks, fallback politicians always “personal responsibility.” heard obtain BNT technology transfer produce BNT August. real issue. Getting tested US harder harder less locations apart. also actively discourage vaccinated people getting tested keep numbers since beginning year.

Good politics, good seeing spread looks like. point testing everywhere quick turnaround. Every approved vaccine effective. still finite number vaccine doses worldwide supply close point extremely choosy brand vaccine. J&amp;J vaccine millions times better alternative, vaccine. mean thousands researchers going vaccines daily yeah right living James Bond Movie. main villain snuck one pass poisoning us. Sounds ridiculous right ? sound write crap.  Another 50 Agreed. don’t get it. What’s downside here. worse campaign vaccinate door door doesn’t work blame Biden ineffective, best people live. justify stance. doesn’t make sense. China went full lockdown zero cases strategy can't run trials domestically find out. depend partner countries delta outbreaks transparent help run trials. planned happen sense measures intended socially construct end pandemic, even ending rooted reality whatsoever. Thanks. waiting son's citizenship papers, almost 2 years finish, go home visit.  actual reaction reading post better writing face palm. seems extremely low everyone knows exponential growth lead big outbreak it’s contained early Australia maintaining almost covid zero 18 months   idea hospitals still make optional 2 step TB testing mandatory state. Color blind testing, drug testing, etc. arguments c19 vaccinations always freedom something like that. You’re free workin healthcare without conditions, add list. Nice talk. Can't even refute that. Indeed. can't claim expert least want know many tested, methodology used/what parameters considered, what's important hospitalisation rate.  People exactly that. too, kid eligible I'm going stay cautious. 

I sucks tho cause performer who's career pretty much ended due covid, I'm itching get back live performances, I'm super careful agree play case. also wish would little caution terms events, looking like pretty much free-for-all point. 

At least it'll outdoors... lot people realise normal 2020/21 Australians. Victoria got hit hard last year NSW currently getting slapped around; time, life pretty good. Lack covid high mineral prices made Australia one world's better performing economies, unemployment low, wages starting move upwards, movies, pubs like good go. 🤦‍♂️ even techs aides. Doctors tip iceberg. They’d figure exact mechanism vaccine causing myocarditis, figure way adjust vaccine without making less effective. It’s possible, immediately. Luckily, it’s pretty easy treat myocarditis happens.  real barrier many people. relatives side effects, I’ve debilitating ones six weeks now. work (I took summer went unemployment) I’d creek right now.

Americans need guaranteed sick days, sister needs assistance call farm. Im complaining government, saying vaccinations unevenly spread Yes general, scientific journal, newspaper.  think last two years shown us answer unequivocally ""no"".

Some, maybe even most, people are, fuck everybody.

So yes, think fair blame government. allow untested unvaccinated people gather 800 discotheque, claiming safe, that's them. endless arguments, managed convince family get vaccinated. 
The thing is, opt J&amp;J Pfizer? California many are. I've 3 vaxxed events  figure hit peak period vaccines + people immune sick. However, immunity (from sick) wearing Delta wrecking havoc since spreads easily. probably round 2 lot vaccinated (but immunity). Also mask mandate probably helped keep slower time.

Vaccines definitely help though. released two years outbreak. hurry, like there's vaccine shortage anything.

Again, fast Japan could possibly go? Slower Cuba? Actively endangering children get put list. see time people saying Denmark abandoned corona pass never understand considering use least three times week lol. earth exit wave? supposed work? Well done Singapore! we, Aussies, form travel bubble ya now. wear mask. people making everyone else wear masks never wear them. dont comprehend push drop mask wearing here, sure make legal requirement still strongly recommended, unless data suggests makes difference delta varient 'possible?'

surely people wear them, less peak pressure nhs next months.

Only logical reason think government planning use natural infection like booster shot infect many people possible winter arrives reguardless consequences short term way get winter without locking down. There’s Kaiser Health study showing ~1/3 unvaxxed Hispanics extremely interested getting vaccinated worried immigration status, unpaid time work side effects, time travel vaccination site combines child care.

Half-wit believed news like believe vaccines much worse side-effects, anti-vaxxer first place. Could please run math? I'm sure understand got that. What? government fine here.

Bold move important decision get vaccinated; choice vaccine secondary importance. 

There lot data real life efficacy Pfizer vaccine, data J&amp;J vaccine primarily comes clinical trials vitro testing. data efficacy vs Delta variant vitro - exposing blood vaccinated person virus petri dish seeing blood exhibits immunity titers. 

Pfizer, hand used many countries efficacy tracked; lot data Pfizer vs Delta variant, relatively speaking. also likely, based clinical trials, Pfizer provides protection (yes, true trials conducted time exactly methods, think Pfizer stronger case efficacy overall). 

Obviously, Pfizer requires two doses J&amp;J one. 

J&amp;J known issue rare blood clotting problem small number women child-bearing age. reports scary first happened, medical community knows handle issues. 

Pfizer (and Moderna) known, rare association myocarditis/percarditis (inflammation heart/tissues surrounding heart), primarily young men. appear serious outcomes problems. 

I believe good data showing J&amp;J provides immunity faster. fact, protection provided two weeks first dose Pfizer appears good (or better) efficacy four weeks J&amp;J. 

For people, choice come proven efficacy (Pfizer) vs. convenience one dose (J&amp;J). Either good choice. decision get vaccinated important one. don’t sequence every genome every positive case. clearly behind estimates miss additional genetic changes sequence detected labs kind work. isn’t routine. actually study, preliminary data..

Probably STILL vaccinated nearly enough people? know, guess.

You make argument we're 80%+ fully vaccinated, we're barely 40%. Yes tests still show infected get tested anyway? Thus completely defeating point tests vaccinated?

Because LOT people tested symptoms, could go party. give lot positive tests important all? Ugh, see article ""Oh, we're it,"" mentality. Sure, hospitalization rates lower. That's great. certainly hope vaccination rates stay high Canada. But: Taking stance though we're ""end"" pandemic *wrong*. end countries high vaccination rates cease incubating new variants.

I’m fully vaxxed tbh don’t see wearing mask time soon. 

Just pray vaccine-resistant variant doesn’t emerge, cause thing continue evolve fight us. worldwide thing beside moment hard say situation booster shots be, it’s clear antibodies disappears. current vaccines provides antibodies least 6-9 months, could potentially longer.

It makes positive impact lives spend time active. Doesnt inside gym all. absolutely anything. Find something love comfortable with. Biking, hiking, walking, yoga home, circus…anything. 

I added part nutrition/eating well really bad myself. actually lost weight depression lockdowns. respond differently stress, kinda shelled lockdowns ate less. working eating variety fruits veggies. (Because lazy eating carbs.) 

The takeaway is, find exercise love, healthy diet works you. Doesn’t lose weight gain weight. It’s important mental health physical health. 

It’s tough year, nourish minds, bodies &amp; souls. also mean inactivated vaccines effective Delta? No, ""broken"" weakened sure. Plenty double vaccinated people dying cases increase die. many before. Known.... Yeah, friend recovered SARS suffers damaged lungs day. joked good thing come first line get COVID vaccine. booster shots soon ? Hindsight’s proven powerful here. time ordering vaccinations one would’ve expected mRNA successful was, likely much stock went adenovirus vectors (AstraZeneca) protein based (Novavax). Indeed UQ AZ options particularly appealing could produced locally. Would conversation Novavax didn’t supply chain issues? got AZ doses Europe thromboembolism described?

Considering 30s offered first dose vaccine around 4 weeks ago many won’t getting second month reopening, frankly feels like kick teeth Yup, fortunately bad overall Union. reluctance places really worrying. Bulgaria might get pandemic several years... pure science basis, we've conducting really complicated mass experiment past year half billions participants; every different governmental private distancing, masking, gathering model bunch different vaccinations, course, 'control group.' proportion young people get virus die disabled? did... farce. went Disneyland week.

Haunted Mansion? Asked everyone cram elevator like normal go ride. Indoors Mr. Toad...asked move queue along taking available space. thought complaining, sentiment govt says open, open....this confined Disneyland. 

The thing is, someone's wearing mask point, know they're likely vaccinated would choose mask (especially heat) getting vaccinated. families parents wearing masks kids were, figure parents likely vaccinated. Putting together I'd say 2/5 1/2 likely vaccinated based mask wearing alone.

I’m assuming delta going make entrance Europe we’ll reliving over... [Public Health England said data showed higher risk hospital admission patients delta variant compared alpha variant, analysis2 revealed two doses vaccine gave high degree protection hospital admission, estimated *rate* hospitalizations higher, lot people vaccinated. So, sense (a) transmission rate higher, leads infections; (b) UK says actual rate admission per 100,000 population higher, virulent (bad). Alright, stand corrected.

Using argument vaccines considering data Australia worldwide pandemic make much sense either. would stop lying it? Hopefully doesn’t cross-check voter status. No, two shots. Moderna one shot well, isnt it? Florida 30k+ cases day. UK. I’d call rampant, less risky undeveloped countries? article says alternative show negative covid test day before. Sorry, get side effects vaccine lasted 6 weeks? report CDC? that? It’s choice know Still democracy no? may feel small there's majority opinion, get want.

Flip side is, may also get want minority, may feel great even fair way things.

There definitely comes point tho, enough people unneccessary lockdowns(whether unnecessary totally subjective, I'm talking people think them!) happen. Hang there, normalcy come vaccination helped push closer. Absolutely agree this. People can’t seem able think what’s reasonable do. looking figures Australia right now.. apparently whole pandemic they've 910 deaths 31,000 cases (1 34) say true, 3 deaths 8,700,000 vaccinations (1 2,900,000). 

People try make vaccine dangerous normally go insane loopholes backwards logic justify points. Either completely misleading likely lying.   That’s Sinovac one first, course won’t effective delta. China vaccine know. 

I’m vaccines poorer nations, seems China actually keeps delivering. Meanwhile it’s leftovers Indian produced ones west. don’t see pandemic getting control you’re counting west vaccine help. We’ll end omega US, EU, UK Canada decide match China’s vaccine amount. Sadly always people like dad keep 30% unvaccinated, “because mRNA tech dangerous key maintain healthy diet”. family dangerous history vaccines (my sister die it), understand reluctance, levels mental gymnastics wild. may end like first surge, people immune protections social distancing wearing masks, rapid caseload increases despite reasonable hospitalization rates overwhelmed health systems. 

Hopefully though. Despite low vaccination rates lot people protected now. quick review nature article. think comparing real world data two clinical trial data Janssen. different setup.

Until similar study performed Janssen vaccin, cannot compare numbers.

This seems pretty common mindset. 1st shot around 30% fully vaccinated near 10%. low numbers, constrained supply.

I could go long time explaining things progressed here, I'm tired it. Man, must love kool aid.  Tapping nothing me, still can’t read it. ideas?

Benefits outweighing risk also fact. Excluding title would create needless fear among people, time everyone needs vaccinated.

Ans problem ""benefits outweigh risks"", title Pfizer coronavirus vaccines 0.00016% risk minor heart inflammation, still less COVID"" Probably! possibilities abusive service workers children. general anyone weaker position do. Virus induced immunity seems suboptimal compared vaccine immunity, don’t think calculate exactly like that. That's like 15 cases every million people... vaccines similar risk?? I'm pro mask mandatory mask thing always difficult one. society self centered, solutions take account better us think. 

I like vaccines lot more. choice protected not, instead ""protecting people"". people choice protect choose risk getting Covid want. Maybe mutate, get deadlier, kill stubborn idiots. 

The rest get boosters deadly variants anti vaxxers spread amongst die. That's I'm hoping goes down. booster additional shot, yet developed. 1 every 625000 vaccinated. Wow, really need consider stopping vaccines immediately mild condition...

To say vaccines ""still outweigh risks"", imply even nearly close call, cause people take jab, definitely greater problem issue.

My point Californias restrictions little prevent spread neither argument ridiculous, you’re trying start something nothing, won’t partaking further. great night.

Ignorance bliss though people. varies regionally though. states 33% eligible population vaccinated states we're getting close 80%. states low levels definitely walking around precautions. Especially since they're also states elected officials walked back even outright banned local precautions. Israeli study hasn’t peer reviewed, still doesn’t change fact vaccines work. I’ve seen many reports people survived Covid tell reporters haven’t recovered completely. waaaay many different lingering side affects lasted months. “If aren’t medically allergic shot gots take it”. Ignorance bliss though people.  completely agree. see way anytime soon. CDCs fault. People needed rewarded getting vaccinated let's tell everyone drop public health orders. Extremely premature. US heads pandemic almost over, ever get people listen abide restrictions? feel many mixed messages leadership, cycle years. like article says, vaccines enough save us variants. combination vaccines, masks, distancing, restricting social gatherings, unfortunately lockdowns needed. I'm sure work going forward, polarized climate. ask currently think best days behind us. That's pessimistic am. leaders, especially medical profession, can't even come together give us consistent advice, hope end soon?   true however jury still far go. I'm lot optimistic. 

Yes flu vaccines vary yearly effectiveness, flu become deadly every year, vaccines become impossible it, need update yearly. 

Covid likely become like this. Never fully eradicated, always present something deal vaccinated regularly against. UK study read 50 fully vaccinated people died Delta, 50 knows pan out, UK least, numbers soaring. Guess we’ll find soon enough.  Ok... exception children 5-12?.... infants? I've interest traveling Malta following traveling restrictions toddler obviously can't get vaccinated yet us parents are. heard anything much regarding travel restrictions children, especially young anywhere. first article I've seen even mentions children. vaccinated parents young children going barred traveling? one former? really crave estrogen atm lol Thank you! feel little relieved now. Gonna bench 1 day squat 2 days first jab, hope die lmao    Nobody safe till everybody safe. news.

Vaccination protect 100% ones vaccinated stupid message passed. need herd, exponentially protected herd.

Vaccination always good choice nobody safe till everybody safe. think people want move on.
Yes, Rona part society long time, what? flue common cold stay, Rona stay!

We're currently developing new treatments new vaccines. going easy? Hell no! spreading fears new mutations dumb move. 
If read articles delta variants Israel, see hospitalization fully vaccinated people still extremely low. Basically, nobody dies vaccinated. 
We poor education vaccines. Vaccines meant stop illness. intended keep people hospitals...

Vox great breakdown vaccine work expect vaccine. ""Ppl visit trending reddit post relevant experiences"" new concept ok. think delta variant came be?? Pandemic's though, right, bro?   chance deaths reported? I’m pretty sure ideologies steal. going keep people fear spreading truth like that? happens unvaccinated fill hospitals? can’t sit back whether like affects us. One main reasons America’s COVID response unmitigated disaster people reason “let’s wait see hospitals get overwhelmed decide need anything.” Every country spared citizens mass death infections acted early effectively suppress disease. doesn’t mean reactively locking you’re filling freezer trucks bodies. means taking sensible suppressive measure, like requiring indoor masking actually vaccination numbers control spread, international travel quarantines, maybe localized lockdowns, sometimes unnecessary congregate settings (places like bars restaurants). Essentially South Korea going whole pandemic. inability reason beyond two options “let people whatever want, uncontrolled spread” vs hard, late lockdowns hundreds thousands dead relative diminishingly small numbers countries.   Moved Florida Vermont mid-April 2020. 

It tough moved without help (early pandemic precautions), greatest move ever made.  That’s means. spreading false info?  think wrong flu vaccines variable effect yearly. years great coverage. enough mutation one strain accounted well end things like H1N1 epidemic 2009.

Covid passes readily flu variant seems increased well spreads deadly is. also limited data effective vaccines delta variant point.

And reiterate, places like Florida low vaccination rate, high travel/tourism, low regard preventative mechanisms (masking, distancing, etc) optimal situation allowing new variants time space grow evolve. Viral evolution centuries long process larger organisms deal active spreading pathogens.

Also, SarsCoV2 flu. closest genetic relative (which still distant one) Sars mutated develop MERS variant without hitting pandemic spread levels.  wish since Delta variant basically becoming dominant every zone touches, looks like matter lot, practice contagious, yet think lot people go around affected fever.

It's reason see removing mask mandate variant much contagious original virus. Yeah turns year masking, could preventing needless flu deaths well. Self Absorbed people care hurt, always make excuses actions deal issues feel unfair.

And correct disease menace quite time think ever becomes manageable unless get better post infection treatments. think flu vaccines variable effect yearly. years great coverage. enough mutation one strain accounted well end things like H1N1 epidemic 2009.

Oh they’re filling hospitals risk dying baseline stuff? You’ve clearly missed whole point vaccinations. anti-vax friends already sent earlier. even Delta supposed near 100%, 100%.

Seems time prepare booster v2 defeat newest variants.  purely anecdotal I’ve seen 3 patients experienced lasting psychosis first time since COVID. One guy 50s well past age onset schizophrenia. It’s very, strange. think flu vaccines variable effect yearly. years great coverage. enough mutation one strain accounted well end things like H1N1 epidemic 2009.

Viral evolution centuries long process larger organisms deal active spreading pathogens. I've trying find data risk myocarditis viruses themselves. could find myocarditis organization saying viruses common cause. 

There's much paranoia Twitter adverse side effects vaccines, seemingly concern understanding viruses like Covid also cause myocarditis. Ya don’t say??? purely anecdotal I’ve seen 3 patients experienced lasting psychosis first time since COVID. One guy 50s well past age onset schizophrenia. It’s very, strange.  Headline dangerously misleading leads vaccine hesitancy. question clear signal rising next month. That's trend throughout pandemic. lots people saying ""what hospitalizations deaths"" rise dramatically next month. Stupid argument. Nobody vaccinating kids polio.  However, totally vaccinating kids virus statistically less risk children seasonal flu. difference actually. E.g. heart complications much issue flu. way sweep feet. **ancedotal evidence** part, got 2nd Pfizer dose back April, doctor said might come Fall 3rd shot (booster).  long pair comparison risks COVID long term, including side-by-side deaths caused COVID vs vaccine, don’t see much issue here. ever end getting official diagnosis myocarditis? visit one post?  Haha yeah, ostriches can't accept afraid. Yep! excess deaths? read somewhere numbers 7m-13m.  tell read viral spread continue 1 regardless. vaccine created research data stolen cyber attacks USA/UK/EU

Except nothing like vaccines, hey let worry you.  easy way, hard way. amazing many people willing hard way. number cases exceed normally seen age group time period. common factor time proximity vaccinations. 

More deductive researching elimination straight proof causality. think idea tinfoilhatty all. think exactly CDC intended dropped mask requirement advisory. obviously knew many unvaccinated people would also choose go without masks would realistic way tell vaccinated not. Herd immunity pretty much practical strategy USA point. social ending pandemic country clearly here; people going comply restrictions summer long. Might well get unvaccinated infected hospitalizations low rather get hit brutally fall, respiratory infection rates always increase.  vaccine right leaving long term trip different state insurance doesn’t work. I’ve weird heart symptoms since may haven’t able get checked out. It’s alarming. don’t think people downplaying least think healthcare accessible people might side effects. Well, vaccines carry similar amount risk blood clots. I'd take temporary myocarditis potentially lethal blood clots.

Neither really likely happen though. Get shots. Thanks comprehensive write sources! sure trolling nearly every study I've seen shown masks make little difference school setting. don’t think UK even kind jump recently?   lot rural hospitals can’t afford replace 25% staff many understaffed anyway. taking 9-12 months replace single doctor much less replace 20 nurses already openings 10 now. 

I expect it’s “officially” FDA approved. already happening Thing is, I’m sure vast majority cases going undiagnosed.  Ya that's going since last summer. conservative clam California make assertion last year? Lol understand whole idea vaccination certificates. Basically, concept seems find way let people things would dangerous otherwise.

So hope mitigate increased danger voluntary activity? Like putting Kevlar vest walking crowd people shooting other?

Am missing something here? state, positive COVID test, ask wait four weeks end symptoms get vaccinated. 1 50!! omg wrong people Good we'll call next variant florida variant.  Basically, rules dropped soon. 26 june government decided away masks, distancing, limits places required testing entry, testing entry system really flawed. example, partygoers screenshotted QR codes sent friends didn’t test, bouncers didn’t properly check ID. labs testing also overwhelmed given many people wanted test able go first weekend ended rushing lot negative results people even didn’t test samples. even one case one guy positive accidentally given negative result partied lot people. top off, cases basically among age group went lowest rates vaccination offered option recently. entire thing poorly thought disaster, basically. almost entirely young males.

Media wants outrage clicks, succinct accurate articles. lot different ways person immunocompromised. get shot, mean everybody can. Maybe missed something article, 90% effectiveness number coming from? kinda seems like pulled number thin air. Great news true though! I've literally heard anyone outside subreddit say want lockdown again. America simply lockdown again. Yes, basically opened everything delta strain became dominant. Masses people took night clubs celebrate, also elsewhere masks longer worn (no longer required either) people basically longer keep distance (officially still required).

At point shut night clubs bars, probably take three weeks recognize (or aquire proof beyond doubt?) sufficient. gross. access vaccine. privilege rest world want people refusing get vaccinated. rather helping virus mutate killing people.   Well, good luck convincing large portion population. 

Give 5 years, politics die down, perhaps cooperative environment get better picture.  Real reason many refused vaccines used political purposes. life never seen vaccines flu shots pushed hard upon people take them. purely choice. suddenly election year Democrats Republicans used covid part political game. sorry say this. Timing strange wrong. believe many believe covid real politicalized.

Bottom line is, hard push vaccine upon people, resist think evil. least, let people make decisions. Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla apologized giving health officials advance notice company would seek authorization third dose coronavirus big picture: Pfizer's announcement, Centers Disease Control Prevention Food Drug Administration published joint statement saying Americans need boosters ""Americans fully vaccinated need booster shot time,"" CDC FDA wrote statement.
Driving news: Blitzer asked Fauci concerns ""lack coordination"" federal government vaccine companies following communication ""We page,"" Fauci told Blitzer. ""They came announcement without giving us heads up."" Myocarditis 3 time life, first tonsillitis, second flu third gastroenteritis. cautious get covid might get myocarditis it. also cautious Pfizer. help. best guess would take J&amp;J

Edit: 32 years old male say that, like not. Oh, baby.  Gotta love total lack hotspots entire northeast. rock!!! stalling vaccination rate lot old people living top that, that's gonna massacre. dumb question!! post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically.

Hi u/nokenito. u/PinkWarPig believe case. lying? caused huge jump? getting hot delta strain. mandatory vaccinations. fly Hi u/nokenito. u/PinkWarPig believe case. lying? posted 3 sir, many choose from. Look appreciate fact don’t want covid end, sadly it’s already one consolation responsible States Counties protected enough provide assistance low vaccinated hot spots run ventilators rooms. Yeah got forbid they're honest side effects medicinal product amirite  Hey guys got 2nd dose waited 10 days rather full 2 weeks, risk exposure significantly higher?  Thanks insight correct! dont comprehend push drop mask wearing here, sure make legal requirement still strongly recommended

If watched press conference earlier week, that's exactly Johnson Whitty said. They're simply removing legal mandate, allow people use discretion. repeatedly said would recommend, would personally wearing crowded public transport, public indoor spaces, someone else might uncomfortable, dropping legal mandate allows someone empty train carriage worry mask on. said repeatedly removing legal interested hearing talk directly. no, German for, Bart The. Different countries different advice optimal amount time wait

For example, UK recommend
You vaccine 28 days positive test COVID-19 28 days symptoms started, 

If treated monoclonal antibodies covid symptoms, check doctor getting vaccinated may recommended wait longer  read paper covid reserch stated patients far likely vascular complications catching virus miniscule chance vaccine. Something like 10 fold!

Very much vaccines. Which, know, designed prevent dieing first place.... TIL! Thanks friend. Epsilon Zeta variant***  completely preventable worries, us Type 1ers sometimes get unnecessary chip shoulders types get lumped together know there’s nothing ours. least it’s pretty manageable technology nowadays. No, trolling all. I’ve lot past year rest world. I’ve lost family friends covid. guess made bit paranoid. town low vaccination rates hasn’t helped mind much. family “We can’t stop living fear” “Things get back normal eventually.”

To question going Florida vacation month now. 

1. It’s third time going in, like, 8 years, normal occurrence. 

And 2. part literally anything doesn’t involve wanting travel Florida right equate “living fear.” study used: agree. COVID19 vaccine complication would've become apparent back January. I've gotten shots myself, side effects uncomfortable still recommend friends relatives take well.

But fence March H1N1 vaccine side effect, think main reason Swedes reluctant vaccinate COVID19. can't change human behavior. response, massive impressive, still often little, late. That's virus killed millions continue kill cripple. sad, there's much it. ""I'm concerned variant becomes dominant, select areas country low level vaccination, like 30% so, going start seeing mini-surges localized certain regions,"" [Fauci] said Friday.

There's persistent spin areas country going see spikes, hard believe difference vaccination rates 30% 50% going huge factor variant whose R0 6 8. think whistling breakthrough infection thought ""vaccine success"" opposed vaccine failure, Walensky said, vaccine developed do: prevent severe disease death.

This definitely big move goalposts covid vaccines, better worse. narrative vaccines keep contracting covid matter do, prevent spreading others.

I actually think realistic attitude, coming kind late day. Spain already fucked cases-wise. Italy better cases ramping right health minister Speranza heavy hand restrictions last year maybe closures. Thank lot 😊 unlikely apply vaccinated people many reasons.

1) regarding testing positive - Someone vaccinated still needs mount immune response squash virus pcr tests pick tiny amounts virus fragments, far lower needed transmit virus cause symptoms. fact test won’t able tell viral fragment (meaning live replicating virus) live replicating virus. 

2) cannot compare immune response someone vaccinated someone unvaccinated. long Covid symptoms appear immune system going wonky mounting autoimmune response. happen someone vaccinated. immune response already primed - learning stage immune misdirection autoimmunity would happen.

3) immune response already primed ready go - period virus replicating like crazy causing micro vascular damage increasing chance sudden death.

4) see evidence shifting immune response happening symptom changes people vaccine breakthrough cases. four top symptoms headache, runny nose, sore throat, cough. Basically - allergies mild cold. It’s symptom profile young children won’t even consider Covid possibility. Wrong. coworker tested positive, know coworkers feel fine. Maybe decided get tested contact someone else did. Also business standpoint, big outbreak ruin you. We've already seen cruise industry none venues want see happen again.  American, third world too! know - long term (totally wrong term there, sorry) meant... Years line. people scared typically vaccine reactions. 

Immediate reactions absolutely happen see respond them. Usually top ways - like Lyme vaccine, questionable side effects science generally considered bollocks, media ruined everyone.

So, lemme rephrase - vaccine (that know of, means correct me) administered large numbers people later found scary side effects years line. American, third world too! One dose seems provide *less* protection delta variant still [very effective based Ontario confidence intervals high, even low-end one dose protective hospitalization/death delta variant. actually first time I've heard regarding covid, go figure. every 24 months Swiss cheese training work computer, 10 years.

 


Not sure someone downvoted comment lol  minority people gotten infected around world. yea it’s theoretically possible would mean ton misery around world ends way. laundry list possible side effects. might get COVID, get second shot, side effects need lot less make sense. 

Hell said don’t vaccinate children 12 it’s dangerous moment. 

And let’s forget vaccine technology existed 2 decades, never allowed use humans. deaths figures 2020? year example rapid vaccination campaign obviously changed data, reducing covid deaths 99%  Going Italy Spain US month August I'm edge seat. know impossible predict, think countries terms restrictions weeks? That's sad. Maybe terrifying. That's sad. Maybe terrifying. clear hey, I've hearing R0 5-6, 7?! Damn man. Kids low spreaders taken account mandating masks, especially small children, face uncertain EUA approval also enough tell people need do. make it. own, many simply won't. assumed early people would get board NPIs lot faster did, totally wrong that. still get Covid vaccinated won’t get seriously ill. People realize right? Data UK US positive. clear hey, I've hearing R0 5-6, 7?! Damn man. liking Vermont? I'm planning move Tampa area next year would wait least 3 weeks. heard need two exposures (infection vaccination) much gap build lasting immunity try change human behavior? change response? Also isnt J&amp;J even less effective Delta original strains? know MRNA somewhat less effective it.  mean, government actually imposing anything people. Vaccines entirely people get, yet government still heavily encourages people get them. Masks known work, heavily encourage them, too? Regardless public willingness mask up? mean, government actually imposing anything people. Vaccines entirely people get, yet government still heavily encourages people get them. Masks known work, heavily encourage them, too? Regardless public willingness mask up? Well third fourth got Pfizer Lmao supporter hahahaha doctors tell you? Johnson Johnson less efficient similar problem Astra Zeneca: [However, women younger 50 years old especially aware rare risk blood clots low platelets country recommend Sputnik V (another vector vaccine, like J&amp;J AZ similar efficiency; without reliable information side effects) Sinopharm (inactivated, side effects, less 80% efficiency).

I would take Pfizer place (if live US). Like stated title, ""benefits still outweigh risks"". Lmao supporter hahahaha  Well third fourth got Pfizer COVID vax service  point said didn’t understand conflict interest? I’d really appreciate that, thanks. Yes, Covid significantly higher risk irreversible damage. concerning. using N99 mask?  Like 3rd mean? can't tell anything small sample. 

Take 4 working-age unvaccinated people get COVID unlikely hospitalized , example. think takes sequencing also. Much longer simple covid test. checked prices Hampton Inn stay upstate NY. pandemic around $105, pandemic dipped $80 rates around $240 even $280 summer weekends completely sold out.

The Hampton Inn basic kind hotels travelers. Nothing fancy. Decent room, used breakfast morning.   may happen unvaccinated states, everywhere. never said ""people experience"" hospitalization. Obviously, hundreds thousands people US died it. actually engaging statement here.

I saying people thay gotten COVID, tens millions it, come away broken organs long term loss taste smell.

Like said before, greatly exaggerating risks COVID people part at-risk population, would say thay contributing vaccine hesistancy. everyone board pretty much lying risks people would internalize, whether choose get vaccine not. Unvaccinated people incubators variants. current vaccines may work well Delta Variant, next one comes along? simply know. Fuck 'em unfortunately work well anyone scenario. absolutely agree that, would still nice know percent people tested vaccinated vs non vaccinated.. logic would obvious even though vax probably catching rate non vax, showing symptoms reason test .. conventional wisdom high majority tested non vax wanted know data support could Netherlands get Delta, isn’t Amsterdam major transit hub Asian globally? one speaks German could evil man Nope, passes. nitpick it’s 5946 deaths related Covid comb data it’s whole gamut errors misleading reports. good chunk 85 bucket comments usually already hospice way major factors. 

Another good chunk 12 vaccines aren’t allowed.

Another good chunk people say vaccinated last year vaccines died long time said vaccine anyway. 

Even dig healthy age population see lots reasons died. It’s kinda like opposite people scream car accident victim counted Covid death.

In case troubling see commonalities heart/blood issues otherwise healthy adults. course myocarditis happens lot viruses don’t see significant spikes reporting deaths year. MM one speaks German could evil man tried find studies well N95 protects COVID chances catching you’re short period time couldn’t find anything.

And yeah I’m sure it’s 100% necessary, could make online appointment, won’t probably time ask appointment I’d miss it. it’s time sensitive. need testing soon catch there’s something bad happening ... treatment within weeks it’s think could be.. original press release FAA: even surprised Low Cost Carriers. hasn’t Delta spread throughout US restrictions? Luck? numbers quite crappy, point. Bruh, think Fauci's comments heavily rooted politics let remind survived Trump administration -- surprise, honestly representing dangers pandemic. uses data going back September 2020. Delta variant even around then? Right, nothing substantial ever come trash institution. Nothing lies Well, herd immunity come! One way another Covid run people infect. confuse thinking there's life outside hometown lol exactly life gone back normal family. goalpost gradually shifting last month so, one seems paying attention it. think concern five one year old… also virus spreading mutating something becomes super contagious all… Check many cases last year time many cases year. Big difference. work well, still lot unvaccinated people. told get tested again, IDK false positives common.  get another vaccine true lot breakthrough cases antibodies waning? I'm thinking report, monitoring went end May. rest time probably authorship reviews. Bureaucracy. thing consider [UK counts covid death ""someone dies within 28 days testing possible good number 50 vaccinated covid deaths ""died covid"", rather ""died covid"". Would nice get details cases. can’t post links subreddit? who’s deleting shit? mentioned comment. UK higher percentage people fully vaccinated though, may affect numbers. solid numbers that. controlled, double-blinded studies effectiveness Delta variant. 

That's used word ""If"" start statement. general principle illustrated true whatever actual effectiveness. equivalence already made skeptics deniers. intent clarify equivalences real world terms people understand.

In area, side effects vaccine weighing risks actual symptoms occurrence COVID need clarified contrasting two.

You disagree that, claiming “people don’t experience much either” completely inaccurate contrasting two.

It simply wrong state “people don’t experience” hospitalization, long term illness, death “that high rates either”. It’s wrong. Contrasting two, COVID million times harmful always be. 

Choose different thread get soapbox on, claimed intent actual effect mile apart make look like you’re arguing bad faith.   Don’t worry. N95 mask keep safe plus everyone else also masks. Don’t give much covid fear ignore necessary appointments. FDA needs decision maker Pfizer conflict interest (booster means sales).

Of course vaccine creator expertise need present evidence review FDA. glad receive J&amp;J vaccine. 

Another example health officials lying us months ago said vaccines J&amp;J effective mRNA vaccines. Nope. reason said get many people vaccinated possible. Glad made sure get mRNA vaccine instead listening CDC.  Yes palpitations! asked incorrectly said didn’t know was. 24 time wasn’t educated cardiovascular health. palpitations continued several months infection still get occasionally. Maybe Reddit Twitter, outside see all. people real world think. vaccines cause drop performances side effects hinder training. anyone know percentage breakdown covid cases vaccinated non vaccinated.. meaning yesterday day saw 25K cases, means number growing rapidly.. percent vaccinated oppose non vaccinated.. anyway knowing.. it’s pretty evenly split guess vaccines effectivity isn’t great, sure data Also state Florida 1/3rd population UK people lie internet Delta parties among yet vaccinated young people mostly, presume. people countries wanting take vaccine take. export vaccines idiots refuse take, twice many people going endangered. big mental leap might think. thousands vaccinated people hospitalized died covid US. still rare, happen. 

The mRNA vaccines 93% effective severe illness (hospitalization death). considered almost 100%? Maybe...not quite though. mechanism action happens would key prevent happening. Yet CDC doesn’t think need boosters.....Pzifer thinks still pushing trials internally create booster. Thank goodness 1-2 weeks summer solstice, UK weeks late spring waning time coronaviruses.   Expload incorrectly written something use future sure haha. assume anyone public mask vaccinated hyper cautious, unable get vaccine health reasons.

The politically unvaccinated still wearing masks  point though since getting covid puts higher risk general looking aspects grand scheme things, RECOMMENDING people get vaccines lower % overall branch issues could get. I'm telling you, vaccines every disease there, would take live much higher risks getting higher % risks everything? people take it, especially realise people vaccines everything really getting sick anything. get vaccine. I'll choose wearing mask taking chances willingly subjecting taking something may cause irreversible damage. 

I respect choice take vaccine. Hopefully long term effects inventor MRNA reacting reports seen. I'm willing take chance.  noted deaths declining since February, lowest 7th day average since April 2020. Sadly, lactose intolerant. Immuno compromised ppl always existed, know medical status, risk, would cover small percentage human population? know risks, covid 19, illness could get serious repercussions them, cover small percentage already know need remain safe getting illness begin trials ""symptomatic COVID.""

It means exactly said 95% actually means vaccinated people 95% lower risk getting COVID-19 compared control group participants, vaccinated. words, vaccinated people Pfizer clinical trial 20 times less likely control group get COVID-19.

...WHich exactly said! People like feel duped.  LOL stop making shit  Meanwhile rest central Europe phasing mask mandates, social distancing guidelines allow dine even nightclubs.

They thing like last summer, feels like groundhog day. course vaccination rates apples apples comparison . Florida vaccination rate, conversation wouldn’t happening. runny nose, headache, sore throat, sneezing, fever. Didn’t even notice heart rate told high got tested. ended getting one finger heart rate monitors seems normal now. believe ibuprofen general fatigue drastically raised heart rate. countries also tracking breakthrough cases evidence long-term effects seen unvaccinated people. fact vaccinated makes huge difference, especially face Delta variant.    assume like Belgium lot people need negative test go vaccation abroad get positive (or negative, depending look it) result instead. way around: people went vaccation brought Corona souvenir along. Hopefully develop long covid chronic health effects afterwards.  think story health experts unsure vaccine hold delta lima strains, hospitalization good sign considering amount unvaccinated people rise mutation strains North America.

...Remember March 2020, always two weeks off? Four tone malone Ok. He's opposed every reasonable measure encouraging vaccinations then. implication make equivalency risks COVID vaccine. suggesting dishonestly mischaracterizing effects COVID majority population catches it. would argue greatly exaggerating effect COVID people contributes vaccine hesitancy. I’m sorry. makes feel better, live US behavior people (and many government) makes feel way. 

Take care. Reading comments one question: people even know Biontech/Pfizer MRNA vaccine great Delta all? honestly wear mine I'm vaccinated. 

I attend large indoor events either that's great loss sounds worse vaccine sort madness. Working vaccination testing site Utrecht province, say false.. know what’s lower? risk severe illness death age group vaccine ☺️ Right, study looking antibodies lab setting. great news understanding still limited. Maybe it'll real world data J&amp;J Delta variant, since far less common vaccines. lab isn’t direct evidence such.

Of course direct evidence lacking direct evidence people turn indirect evidence interesting coincidence. Ok let's keep track cases coronaviruses also highly infections

*I bot, action performed automatically.

BUT, i'm concerned 'dangerous' virus lab close proximity large metro areas.  

How making labs remote islands off-shore (oil rig type thingy) workers work 6 month shifts.  people go 2 week isolation getting off. referencing study punished bioRxiv, know specifics claims, quote note: bioRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports peer-reviewed and, therefore, regarded conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, treated established information.

I'm sure there's truth though I'd love options explored. said, alternatives mainstream discussion, start asking that's case. Normally alternatives bogus, legitimate.

I understand reasons ones hesitancy. time, believe beliefs bring harm believer society. Even may better undeveloped alternatives vaccines, taking vaccines still best pathway. least know there's trillions dollars incentives toward ensuring vaccinated people experience negative health ramifications result. would want evolve control

That assumes deliberately released. accidental, escape could happened finished engineering. comment evidence nothing. Personal responsibility definitely work public problem.

It's way easy come conclusion personal risk low deciding go life. See would prefer learn stuff like doctors going give shot reddit post instead give short answer ""totally fine"" kinda get maybe want go details get done it. 
But yeh could read first come conclusion yet theoretical risks. think anyone ""Fauci supporter"".

Support science, man. infallible. Intervention fine. end? 

You can’t undo countries government things get tough couple years. Certain principles need remain certainly don’t blame kids, I’m heartbroken we’ve failed massively containing thing it’s gotten point. Sending kids gymnastics middle part problem fault. Thanks fucking add uBlock   Gotcha, thanks clarifying :) I'm scared city. huge summer event (Calgary Stampede) province city dropped nearly restrictions. There's going fuckloads people packed tents getting drunk hell, plus tonnes people going events practicing distancing wearing masks. Variant gonna fuck us hard Ok deaths???? like continently leave numbers out. Fear mongering Sounds like great place live mean choose UEFA peoples health… stay island I’m saying. like wanted part Europe anyway. I'm vaccinated stopped wearing mask out. feel fairly safe Midwest town pretty left leaning many crazies. still wear work required, rule thumb employees wearing now, wearing mine. Seriously? thinking adolescents like toddlers learn get reward immediately desired behaviour wait two weeks? would work Spain people hit clubs 2am earliest. confirm GGD itself, masks still mandatory 😅 Yeah, get - remember feeling invincible getting first second doses. keep reminding full immunity yet, restrict behavior. less self control less trust science, sure could done something stupid.

Rules account dumb human behavior.  I'm talking everyone commented thread. you’re US, ER see you. Go, good luck. We’re rooting you. implying sort conspiracy? I’m include fat people smokers too. developer Johnson Johnson vaccine, development happened Netherlands tend use name. chip people make laugh. Boy one cares day. Unlikely doesn’t mean impossible. I’m going afraid disease I’m vaccinated guy Reddit knows guy breakthrough case. think implication everyone comment thread. know misread said what, one questioning climate change. would know seek treatment first place? know could before/from another time sick. think bad seems, lot people want travel get tested.  Yet still accurately shows vulnerable unvaccinated are, particularly certain environments. last time Rogan funny Phil Hartman still alive. Denial strong coping mechanism, especially helped along motivated interests and/or tied identity. 

It really help one avoid fear maintain normalcy. Unfortunately, it’s bad response pandemic obvious reasons. also curious severity, since seems vaccinated people still contract much milder cases. cool advancements vaccines allowed us foothold cold? actually thinking VIKI 64% chance wont spread it.  What's ""Janssen"" vaccination?  guy talking to? can’t go ER?  common cold

I really hate phrase. normalization failure. pretends good strategies prevent tough live it. fact, effective strategies. want them. yet. full reopening week away. surprise see another big uptick couple weeks' time. That's promising still real world results yet? u/zeraussiul says, normal time stereotypical multi generational Anglo-Aussie ties overseas. 30% Australians foreign born definitely normal 18 months. 

I family totally stuck fuck knows we'll get see again. next door neighbour son baby two years ago they've never met. There're countless thousands people who've miss family funerals, can't visit dying parents etc etc. Despite seeing happened India, baffles people taking delta strain lightly.

In India, people literally stopped social distancing December 2020 onwards. January March, see noticeable rise number cases. 

And that, cases skyrocketed. thing changed delta variant. even followed social distancing wore masks got infected. fair, given risk young people, level vaccination risk, it’s workable strategy…  ploy get rid surplus janssen vaccine july lol  protective mean case? Immunity? Symptomatic disease? doesn’t stop believing non-scientific conspiracy nonsense. Deaths AZ happend. pretty good known. 

Maybe people referd Biontech?  Yes, noticed countries ahead. wanted exclude microstates, drawing line minimum 1 million inhabitants quite arbitrary.

Anyway, curious see virus spreads countries truly vaccinated, 2/3 population like Israel UK. Yes that's works. likely got polio effectiveness reduced body ate like champ.

Vaccines mitigate. 100% protects, reduce severity symptoms. can't believe real number. Delta 1.4 UK, believe? Russians largely unvaccinated far less aware safety protocols.   think everyone page Climate change real evidence properly published peer reviewed

Lmao can't seriously believe that. good chuckle thanks fully vaccinated, got 2nd Modena shot February. currently getting ass kicked COVID though. can't find doctors see area due one wanting see COVID patients. struggling hard breath feel like death. nebulizer medication it. anything else feel better. Dayquil life right now, helps breath lungs still hurt like hell. feel weak too. need go hospital? Germany. Measures unchanged months now. Yeah, think every vaccine breakthrough cases. hope well get severe case! think lockdown likely either sub, daily threads particular, quite echo chamber. exempted people also wear FULL PPE. Mask, gloves, face shield gown. can’t compare states without accounting variables.

That’s whole point. Claiming state took covid seriously data shows higher rates infection deaths national average contrarian. Death card.  upgrade support expires?  want government mandate people inject something bodies. never happen. notice signs breathing difficulties? I’m worried golden retriever issues breathing covid Especially since many people already predicting outcome, people also right previous times cabinet wrong. think fourth time around would get little bit smarter. Guess brain fog. strange everybody says vaxxed chances get . feel like know many people circle heard people getting virus twice even vaccine . .. yourbsympt worse ?  context: many vaccines given Indonesia China's Sinovac vaccine; notoriously less effective vaccine. I'm pretty sure Euros fieldlab test strict rules, clubbing copied test results one day old vaccination proof way bigger problem. *India Brazil entered chat* actually stick around can’t pass vaccines Maine get hot tourism.

Already know three families canceled Florida trips go Maine.  first half, gonna lie exactly, happended me. rest couple weeks two weeks finally feel better. sucked! *caugh* *caugh*. still here, alive well…. Still asleep? scattered thoughts:

* FL's vaccination rate basically national average, spread great sign.
* Older people tend vaccinated, death rate much lower
* vaccinated, largely safe severe disease, hospitalization, death. [Over 99% people died COVID since vaccines became widely available fully People keep saying confidently, know two people one family member got covid twice even vaccine second time symptoms painful. Apparently got deleted, remember day. I'm convinced beginning here. Maybe fall better cases hot people travel outdoors since summer unbearable. Hopefully rest Europe world see make right desicions thinking relaxing certain rules. mean, expect, people partying untested yet working vaccination. CFR similar previous estimate unvaccinated population.  quote: 

""why use rather known propaganda supplier?"" 

""Them"".... context referring BBC comment directly responding to. 

Come man!

Can't quit ahead now. fair, using percentage _doses_ rather percentage _vaccinated individuals_ also misleading, since take two doses (with potential booster coming). don’t want take children anywhere plane. Everybody exposed plane seek compensation tests, quarantine, infection found positive. agree restrictions dropped waaaaay soon, many data scientists already saw coming time, number people ""cheating system"" cannot explain all. 

There fact test could 40 hours old enter venue, lots happen between.

There fact *Minister Health* told everyone could take Janssen vaccine go club day. 

I think government advisory organizations OMT, public health institution RIVM completely touch reality people behave, already loosening restrictions saw mask mandates ignored, people sitting close together cafes restaurants little ventilation. fair might German, Belgian, Luxembourgian French still traveled many people US get side state.  benefit outweighs risk deal risk. pro covid vaccine got it. am, 3 months later, still dealing vertigo inflammatory nerve issues. adverse reaction, easy say benefit outweighs risk. even test Olympics? point athlete get vaxxed made business decision to.  longer health safety issue  also big sporting events right now, nobody seems able give fuck anymore.    know, back almost 500 day city 900 state, 300 state 130 day city. God fucking damn get Moderna county highest vaccination rate Illinois Dupage 57%. next 5 populous counties right around 50%. Chicago alone 1 million unvaccinated people 234 sq mile area. I’m nearly worried Fayette county 24% vaccination rate comes 20,000 unvaccinated folks spread 700 square miles. Illinois’ 47% vaccination rate 100% driven Cook, Lake, Will, Kane counties they're dumb, they're scared. berate people worried vaccine medicine. Headlines like also help. Yes! Also stronger immunity summer. Better spike autumn. see many hospitalizations week. guess minor peak. nowhere near peak (~15,000/day) January.

It much nearer peak February, March, April. May, June. go back one worst periods Florida Florida Georgia appear peaked January. states different times. Alabama December. Massachusetts earlier agree this?

Yes. Yeah especially higher risk people. France recommending Scott Gottlieb(on Pfizer board former FDA) said likely happen mandate vaccination done it? Masks great cure. cure, going encourage/recommend/mandate anything - mandate cure - mitigation. even understand god damn point. also heart burn costochondritus feel similar addition clear answer: people allowed go nightclubs untested _immediately_ second Janssen vaccination, instead waiting two week working window. thing happened Europe last summer. fall back lockdown mode again... actually think going without mask last weeks caught it. 

I live decently dense city. something going around people covering faces makes sense get eventually. Kinda like flu. problem government people seem care. seen people say covid scam, coverup fraud, seen anyone die it. stupid people frustrating see kind people Mask works better mask. need N95. That’s horrible. I’m truly sorry loss family endure.

Sadly smh  dealing since first shot feeling crazy. went ER thought dying said fine 🤷🏼‍♀️ Basically infections &lt;25yrs old, yet vaccinated. 
They needed negative PCR test go clubbing bar. Many current positive numbers asymptotic carriers, without bars clubs open would shown numbers. (And lots youngsters cheqted fake PCR testst government blundered allowing freshly vaccinated Janssen people, go clubbing without waiting 14 days)
Add superspread events said clubs/bars positive cases related fun night outs… Yeah it’s ridiculous. Another thing find ridiculous know people last opening went eat 2-3 times day always restaurants drinks, threw house parties weekly multiple family members die. took 0 accountability justified “I’m young, allowed live free fun”. Needless say want nothing people still makes blood boil see many people think way. I’m young too, don’t care much myself, don’t want reason partners family elderly colleagues family members would suffer chose temporary euphoria caring society. Sorry rant makes blood boil whenever get called boring wanting go “live free take risks”. Yup this. I’ll still get booster needed CDC didn’t want scare away antivax would know they’d need potentially three shots cover year. 

The CDC probably figured even refuse booster least they’d partial immunity still got 1-2 shots.  thread total yes, comment chain. 2nd level comment vaccinated people catching delta general. Anybody else know someone got covid twice, even got vaxxed ?   true.  median age infected 14. It’s still pretty uncommon children age 14 vaccinated. ideology I'm leaving :)   count they’re *heading* Florida? Amen! best time. Reinfections rare, address later comment.

Respectfully, isn’t true. We’ve real world studies while. Neutralization tests useful definitely best thing we’ve Totally, disagree links provided section quoted?

I wouldn’t say “disagree” (although one “VeryWellHealth” scientific journal tend pay attention them), think it’s important note they’re real world numbers, Petri dish suggestion reword section

Personally would say merit vaccines stands it’s own, doesn’t really need comparison natural infection immunity, since think rational people would prefer vaccination natural infection begin with. problem with, comes section, strongly suggests vaccination induces stronger immunity natural infection, possibility left open simply “similar”. face real world results sometimes zero reinfections found, 99% reduction symptomatic disease found, seems misleading state information way vaccines certainly 100% 99% effective symptomatic disease. Granted, *some* results *all* them, still open interpretation, me, would feel bad writing sentence way without noting possibility vaccine induced immunity may actually fall short natural immunity, studies attempting find real-world benefits vaccination natural infection often come short. isn't. Hospitalization risk dropped percentage points. Isreal even seem tonthinknthere much drop. complete prevention infection dropped like 25%.

You much likely still catch delta vaccinated, barely likely severe case. else k how's someone got covid second time vaccines? sister law breakthrough infection right now, too. Sure, hospitalized, really suffering woods yet. Stay healthy, friend. Steroids maybe? colchicine. nothing, also resolve bad cold fall 2019. sleep sitting due cough 6 7 weeks. hard time walking (exercise walking, strolling) couple months cough started subside. steroids, inhaler, nebulizer treatments, minimal improvement. know better I'd thought covid. sucked. yeah, true. Still want covid. Possibly???? saying sounds like anecdotes conjecture airline doesn’t get keep fine. imagine??   Locking devolving pure politics. Perhaps they’re judgement-proof? plan move shithole state soon can. Hopefully back Rocky Mountains someplace. Florida flat sucks. mention, testing standards vaccinated persons either nonexistent diminished. We’re going see widely reported incidence amongst vaccinated (breakthrough infections) health promotion strategy surrounding COVID vaccines relies message unquestionable effectiveness. It’s really rough catch-22.  never go delusion I'm going change mind, want hear different point view occasionally.

Well said. can't take NSAIDS due stomach bleeding? Florida United States' personal India.

Now get local delta variant petri dish Nah, pretty much Europe back normal masks indoors. don‘t even wear masks gyms anymore Switzerland. Yes, Florida managed slightly exceed national average elderly vaccination rates proceeded completely drop ball age groups. GOP governors offered incentives vaccination, Mr. DeSantis seems really care primary voting bloc secure. True 'logical' leadership. stats infection-asymptomatic/mild-severe/death went 90-95-near 100 (62-79)-(88-92)-(93-99). studies Delta still bit place, even agree general trend. Roughly 90% seniors risk Florida vaccinated, virus kills less 1% unvaccinated people. Stop pushing fear he’s (if *the*) front runner Republican presidential primary 2024 election.

They incredibly efficient generating unpalatable candidates imaginable. That’s great, gymnastic place, like mostly children. read article it’s ages 5-58, many unvaccinated likely 12 couldn’t anyway. preview schools opening next weeks. true, also true stores/public areas one vector people interact other.

I'm sure masks stores prevent *some* spread, really sure much adds unvaccinated people go restaurants eat maskless hang maskless informal household gatherings. too!! doctor believed trying find something help (oddly Zyrtec helped?

It going really bad there.  surprising all! Again.. never suggested people limited amout data information regarding vaccines. making reality here. simply suggested information presented way clear &amp; unbias. Unfortunately one person work received J&amp;J shot got it. Fortunately wearing mask time since feeling best. Nobody else tested positive. Everybody else got Pfizer/Moderna. Curious Delta variant. .0001% vaccine recipients get side effect. Corona virus killed .002% U.S population. Yeah Maine state sense. think true maybe I'm wrong think keep looking data saying "" covid affect kids"" reality kids biggest vector pandemic parents parents working home socially distancing masking seriously reduced primary vector dangers kids.  


In coming weeks antivax parents sending kids school wit vaccinated parents kids people less likely mask distance especially feel like setting us large outbreaks among children . 


I could absolutely wrong welcome idea I'm absolutely wrong concerns keep little "" wave away thought "" thing comes kids covid .  
I know idea thousands kids ravaged covid disturbs us much consider bothers much keep reading simple phrase nothing really back "" Oh cool kids infected covid doesn't;t affect kids"" .  


I think we're building fake narrative hope alarmist wrong misguided worry we're looking situation right.   Yup, hoping best well. Especially hoping hospitalisations deaths explode like given fact almost medically risk people elderly fully vaccinated. bf J&amp;J (got back March) tested positive covid. sick. also sick positive covid test, moderna vaccine. samples sizes insanely small. I'm saying data useless, can't put much confidence it. think matters much. X people catch it. X% die it.  Vaccinated people wouldnt represent stat. take without protection, compare percentages. Everybody thought virus dying out. 'economists' voice eventually outweighed voice 'doctors'

The virus care either way I'm sorry loss.. unfortunately seems like people need lose people circles taking anything serious tbis matter. delta strain one India, Brazil, different one?

Last read brazil one worst. Hey, could too. Im doctor dont want make conclusions. Even \*all\* people tested postive TvT (10% total) would continue GGD another test systems stupid enough count people twice would still explain 10% additional increase. much, much that.  mass vaccination young people definately help lot, hand. Let's hope best... Right? west would get head ass think people. Sauce: US citizen married Japanese one treated opening/not opening like fucking lighswitch. open little observe? People go holidays party summer. places that's delta already, UK, Britain, Israel etc., evidence nearly dangerous though contagious? heard someone saying far less likely lead serious illness deaths. made sense, get that. feel like need justify decision. bad one all, Dutch people (my fellow country men women) would followed basic ass rules little longer. bad can't rely people taking thing seriously people following proven simple measures protect loved ones everyone. 
Hope good time one got sick.. mean _let_ touch candy still hot ofcourse gonna backfire. would hope acted government actually let clubs untested least two weeks full vaccination. unfit government. supposed 12 million adults vaccinated. That's roughly 24 millions shots. since also vaccinate children 12 number several million higher.

We're yet. shot Pfizer/AztraZeneca/Moderna protect sufficiently dekta variant Apparently lot complaints cheast pain due slight fever accompanied second shot lot people. chances didnt expirience inflammation way article refers to. tested positive covid despite fully vaccinated moderna since March. symptoms pretty severe, worse bad flu  Known 2 people die heart inflammation shortly taking vaccine. Perfect health, athletic. change mind, miss them.  incidences happened first dose.  Yes, tested negative.  Sounds like vaccine worked! WTF Netherlands! mandatory masks last week Canberra Australia (0 cases since July 2020) one Delta carrier (that became 50 week) Sydney three hours drive away side effects unreported, actually told whenever signed vaccine, one side effects. There's CDC line call regarding questions concerns vaccine. tested covid? covid despite fully u vaccinated since March know feel like ab ig part due sometimes questionable contract gym owners make attendess sign . need people visiting gym justify charged ass services fact sometimes sign 3, 6, even year long contracts means would way able support compensate gym attendees closed doors.

I could absolutely wrong makes sense gym industry largelyrefused embrace restrictions business model alone. may apples oranges, still compare them. 

Also, fuck banned. mention fact rise cases nearly entirely exclusive people 30. cases ages 20 30 increased tenfold. Britain, UK Israel delta bad proof less dangerous/lethal? Seems rise cases far less serious illness deaths. variables play? tad difficult outjab exponential growth.  18 year old male here, got second shot week ago now, minor chest pain 4 days after, could inflammation, popped advils days i’m totally fine now. still recommend getting shot. would country say get shot fired give money.. force vaccinate. gotcha. didn’t mean kids fault refusing vaccinate, kids responsible spreading it. It’s irresponsible parents. trash. catch Covid die, vaccine safety concerns. wore masks wrong (not covering nose)

Silly you, everyone knows masks cover chin near-impossibility people expounding hypothesis lab escape engaged practice science.

The natural origin hypothesis quite easily falsifiable (e.g. show escaped lab), within practice science. Pretty much going happen England next month. Latest article Nature [suggests one vaccine dose Pfizer AZ offers 10% protection Delta makes J&amp;J vaccine (the one dutch pushed hard onto youth) effectively worthless Delta.

This important get 2nd jab ASAP Let check calendar...yep 2021 alright. Almost thought accidentally time-traveled someone still think masks useful virus mid-2021. California fewest infections deaths per capita US especially among large states least 10 million population. large state less deaths per capita NC based worldometers. California done good job far relative rest US. Therefore vaccinate much higher percentage lacks natural immunity many states. 50% LA county awful considering vaccine available quite time. vaccinations don’t pick rough schools resume. anecdotal, two people know (married other) covid received J&amp;J. Good news neither required hospitalization mend. definitely sick though (low fever, bad cough). I'm glad find would like without vaccine. Long covid.... I've seen multiple reports affect 30% more, even milder cases.

That strategy going backfire spectacularly.

Also hospitalizations dropped 95%, probably go 20x higher number infections. think everybody agrees science: antibodies wane bit time, delta evades immunity little bit. original mRNA vaccines still pretty effective preventing infections period, highly effective preventing severe disease.

From Pfizer's profit-motivated perspective, good take ""belts-and-suspenders"" approach push booster doses tailored variants. CDC's public health perspective, asking population get vaccine every six months, one knocks people asses 1-3 days, probably workable. CDC, slightly less effective vaccine delta still good enough. India country touched Spanish flu back  thought talking Fiji apples.. /s sounds way likely common side effects, slight fever dehydration.  Fevers make heart race.    article nothing lockdown impacting man, hospitals overwhelmed. anything strict lockdown would helped due keeping hospital numbers lower. Cố lên Việt Nam ơi! Tbf, always knew potential side effect tell either sign getting shot. click-bait article reporting data CDC released fear-mongering way. actually think extend past adolescence include adults. 

People fucking idiots, treat Isn’t old news? remember talked kids back may People need actually read articles commenting. comment government officials. “reportedly” stuff. Netherlands apparently R0 1.3 already day reopened. known hindsight.

God knows R0 now? no, means body different immune response. innate immune response causes side effects adaptive immune response doesn’t. give protection. risk dying corona virus also low.  principle. People trust vaccine. really effort most. Denmark iReland got fair share since bought extra vaccines Romania. got jump ahead non guarantee even earlier Portugal Spain. 

Ireland Denmark got populations 5 million bought one million extra vaccines proper share Romania. Obviously got jump ahead big portion ahead fair share. experts did, Rutte co. chose to.
How still power crazy last years beyond understanding Ok, mistake. suggest provides literally evidence. Typical fear mongering. 

From I’ve read, common delta symptoms runny nose sore throat. Stronger immunity summer? Where'd get from? Oh heavens Betsy I'm one them, despite fully vaccinated. Lost sense taste today :(   red meat tribe weaponized idiocy.  I'm guessing said Yikes never read paragraph presented wikipedia scary? think CDC ""followed science"", completely ignored dynamics schools psychology school kids.

California still going require masks everyone think California got right time best way protect school kids COVID-19.

First, going kids seen Trump influencers running around without masks who'll question need wear masks get vaccinated (ignoring fact Trump got very, sick COVID-19 refused wear mask, plus later quietly got vaccinated).

Second, two groups students, masked unmasked, masked students basically signaling everyone parents anti-vax, anti-mask likely strongly conservatives.

Or likely large cohort unvaxxed students also refusing wear masks. guarantee lots schools sources COVID-19 outbreaks Fall. live state never really took pandemic seriously begin with, part life stayed pretty normal entirety pandemic except first months people least pretended care. 

Been fully vaccinated since March finally music festivals concerts back, pandemic seems exist anymore. way look it, anyone still gets sick COVID due fault. 

As far I'm concerned, would lot easier everyone involved unvaccinated people caught figured whether gonna die finally move on.

Read current history books (not 1950’s textbooks) it’s really horrible. getting tiring, yes cases go places open, hospitalizations deaths aren't.

&amp;#x200B;

The vax prevents hospitalization/serious illness 93-97% infections. Seeing governments realize others ignore maddening Lockdowns work OK. could allow fully vaccinated people attend. even safer. ZOE reports suggests we've pretty much peaked. Official figures week behind doubling time stretching fast line ZOE predicted.

All evidence suggests we'll probably peaked 19th. interesting see much last step increases cases. Huh? prone breakthrough cases? 65+ 75% population. weren’t prone you’d normalised distribution matches population  Allowing kids get would also raise vaccinated population percentage.    Parents wanting vacation without kids disgusting? Since when? Thanks service! Every hospital system different suppose.... worked larger metro healthcare systems....

What mean laws? said forcing people unethical. means laws unethical. maybe misspoke. Nah, people covid report worse side effects first shot pretty much nothing 2nd shot. without covid often worse side effects 2nd shot Well able shipped room temperature believe. lot it. makes sense. Obviously I’m gonna complain making money think it’s complex issue that. know plenty people turning amounts $80-100 shift. last week. 

Money alone won’t make people want hospital are. It’s dealing people (understandably) worst pretty terrible things considered. It’s we’re seeing mass exodus bedside nursing. Constant physical mental abuse patients probably bigger deterrent death sickness. latter expected. former comes nowhere nurses aides supposed suck take it. Unlike basically every job existence. 

A PREGNANT coworker mine punched stomach last week completely oriented patient management mad called police it’s gonna hurt patient satisfaction scores. patient’s family furious could “hold father sick”

It’s honestly tiring think things like exact reason see healthcare workers following rules. Feeling like you’re fed wolves makes people care Pfizer expects COVID-19 vaccine major revenue contributor years, forecast sales $26 billion shot 2021. Global spending COVID-19 vaccines booster shots could total $157 billion 2025, according U.S. health data firm IQVIA Holdings.

Yeah, I'm suspicious all. Latest PHE data shows vaccines are:

● 80% effective hospitalisation one dose. 

● 96% effective hospitalisation 2 doses.  Unfortunately countries really force people get vacccinated, though laws drunk driving. often comes ""personal choice"" governments around world hoping inhabitants making stupid decisions. contradictory news. One article says masks required indoors another says required fall...what heck. Mask wearing seems become much norm. visiting friends. (I forgot comment P4 safety...)

Additional Info Dr. Lipkin: Right personal freedom get job somewhere else. thing nurses allowed strike, critical jobs higher risks face different allowable regulations regular jobs. nothing new Yeah. know I'd call life mostly normal though. number friends spend time indoors still, masks required number places, summer festivals would normally attend cancelled. want know I'm ever getting life back fully. would never call expert, therein lies difference.

I'm frankly damn tired it. Right pandemic unvaccinated. They're bringing upon themselves. yesterday, apparently normally mild think assume nurses would smart enough get vaccines anyway find cheap £7ish, seems good true seeing still £50-60 many places. official site seems 'relaunching', find bit unsettling.

Has anyone got experience info?

Thanks That's thinking 99.5% reduction flu cases  Test negative Yes, self-flagellation certain. could please execute well redeem failure I'd grateful. No, it’s not, it’s still interesting factoid gets people’s attention. That’s another way putting it. It’s like come bro, stop giving virus chance mutate. Medical tyranny (hopefully) learned lesson leaving ski resorts open starting P1 variant outbreak lol. I’m glad least they’re going back restrictions get things calmed (even it’s immediate… skiing, kept open juuust long enough resorts wouldn’t lose money big holidays/have refund season passes haha) Thank , Canada There'll covid bushes tho course not, thought speaking children generally, historically higher rates general population. seeing europe, governments treat first shots fully vaccinated, getting rid non pharmaceutical measures early ignore bubbles low vaccinated groups (for example younger). Additionally sounds good paper, implemented IRL two different things. still act surprised happens country failed everywhere else. Exactly happened UK aswell. frustrating. Nah. correcting idiotic idea conservatives responsible dumbing America's education system. police send away schools? Haha, nice :)

edit: love irony Sounds like vaccines working pretty well friends. 

The endgame make covid asymptomatic cold people get it, everyone sterilizing immunity entire lives.

That said, sign booster whenever get it! family South Korea says lack access. They've openly shared frustration(s) government well people US would pass opportunity vaccinated countries access.

He's hyperbolic people India American roots... Replicating non-human hosts generally weakens virus humans though - indeed that's exactly ""attenuated live"" vaccines made: grow non-human tissue (monkey kidneys ISTR?) still infect humans - well enough trigger proper infection. done maths likelihood suffering 'long covid', infecting somebody else?

Those issues consider. Keep safe.  Also, model used epidemiology cited creates relative risk reduction removing baseline risk. It’s everybody uses say vaccine effectiveness efficacy. whatever individuals baseline risk moment is, there’s 80% reduction risk - leaving 20% baseline risk infection.

(Tennessee, btw). I’m angry still.  Yes, we’ve seen countries fortitude, patience, discipline things right first time rather constantly half-assing things deal much worse outcomes. owe hospital $100,000, that's problem

If owe hospital $1,000,000, that's problem Cases going happen, virus permanent. going vanish one day ""like miracle"", going completely vaccinate existence. tens millions swine flu infections period time government said ""fuck it"" stopped counting cases.  


As long hospitalization numbers manageable, there's reason believe able get fine.  vaccinated, breakthrough infections entirely mild, asymptomatic altogether. unvaccinated adults, serve another reminder get done. Researchers studying working mRNA vaccines decades. Interest grown vaccines developed laboratory using readily available materials. means process standardized scaled up, making vaccine development faster traditional methods making vaccines.

mRNA vaccines studied flu, Zika, rabies, cytomegalovirus (CMV). Smh get strong response shot 2, probably didnt covid. also possible dont get strong response all. Everybody reacts differently dont feel side effects shouldnt take sign vaccine isnt working.  wait 2 weeks. gonna crazy. like post Super Bowl surge! There’s wide gulf supposed reality. covid 2 months ago, body already primed respond it. got vaccine, immune system thought ""hey know is"" directly kicked gear fight (what thinks is) another infection. I.e. reaction vaccine good sign, body work increase defenses virus. government mandating anyone get vaccine. problem unvaccinated folks keeping virus around longer have, becomes concern vaccinated people's protections start wane become vulnerable. 

I hate say it, fits well here...

\^This 

I realized this, I'm getting pissed knuckleheads letting thing linger. Especially people legit medically unable get vax. Like, they're counting us collectively sweet [herd failed. 

And *we'll* failed, protection subsides damned virus still around beaten back much severely. real shame. I'm sorry understand all. 95% effective preventing hospitalisations compared control, hospitalisations 95% lower, literally sentence. probably likely get killed gun violence US 40 yet people paranoid COVID. hysteria days odd. blame media. somebody who’s spent boatload time RTs last two weeks, pisses off. last thing want catch something somebody giving breathing treatment, especially since I’m already really fragile covid right would probably enough finish job. It’s almost gotta nothing suggestions. Yeah...I mean, I'm surprised Naples like that.   Lambda variant concern, important enough US [CDC they're listing 10 named variants.

Just turn news. good you: seems like relevant information, useless since can't anything it. Here's [Psychology Today article what's plan then? Lock country forever?  lot border restrictions make sense nowadays. People Latin America allowed enter US somehow can't enter directly Germany...but Mexico 14 days beforehand.

AFAIK, thats likely true. It’ll harder control 2020 lot people behaving pandemic we’re all-clear. Messaging government isn’t helping perception either. Outside rich countries. us simply vaccines available us, nothing conspiracy theories. mandate allow sue something happened lol tf talking know, would businesses want end home office? convenient them, save ton money. excuse cut salaries due course, go on. CDCs ineptitude utterly maddening. Masks should’ve recommended jump stick around shit over. simple stuff. attempts manipulating public pathetic failure. takeaway laughing comment I’m anti-vaxxer?

Lmao. don’t want “mild” covid, I’m happy take booster. 

If people two doses fine getting “mild” covid, missing work (and pay) two weeks, scaring everyone around them, that’s choice. people choosing comfort level vax max vax. Picking place spectrum seems fair enough me. true. Even people experience aftermild symptoms help hospitalizations deaths, point.  really, cancelling events, promising wouldn't, shutting disco's, still masks anywhere everything else goes normal. Still work-at-home advisory either. despicable. Ive read j&amp;j effective delta. sure that’s factual read somewhere credibility. remember someone mentioning way back January 2020. 

It main reason started buying face masks. worry, laugh anti-vaxxers too. want booster asap. don’t trust fauci, CDC, none em. shut tomorrow. course, probably 80-90% now. CDC estimates always behind weeks, latest data almost samples US positive delta. vaccines helping? work virus? people vaccinated,? jet injectors solved problems earlier models needles administered easily instead. I've learned last 2 years people simply stupid naive both. want party gov says people so. blame stupid. Blame gov haha Cases doubling week, that, one reliable signs runaway infection rate 2020.

Obviously rate increase continues 50 times many cases 2 months. Preferably 15% assets, ""income"" misled. Lol. honestly hate ""party factoids"". stick people's heads take twenty-fold time effort put perspective behind it. example, London perceived huge city modern people, around 1100 less population Rome - lowest point latter since fall Roman Empire. Constantinople around 1100 25-35 times bigger. Babylon \~10 times bigger best (and that's level development NA cultures peaked around). Stop. comment chain removed per rule 1: civil. Follow [sub's going participate here. area, CVS allows select either PCR Rapid test appointments. Even one Netherlands would vaccinated all, see kind spike yet infections numbers skyrocket days far hospitalizations always bit delayed. 

Look hospitalization number weeks see current vaccination rate Netherlands helps prevent prevent. read recently older people massively over-represented vaccinated population UK. words (properly) put effort vaccinating older people first, though half overall population fully vaccinated, US. Since older people likely die covid, seeing pretty low death rate UK even Delta variant spreads.

The picture quite different US, vaccinated population tends diverse, plenty older people currently unvaccinated even though overall percentage vaccinated people similar UK. implication Delta variant going hit US population harder far number deaths concerned. 

Obviously, hope that's true, reasons thinking it. Vaccines available everyone worldwide yet. Even Europe people still waiting list several countries due shortages know you, thought global year long lockdown fun. I’m glad I’m risk contracting deadly virus every time go see doctor. Voluntary mask usage always thing. Schools cant tell wear mask. girl wearing mask since January 2020 heard China (which man end right)  know wrote even know anymore. going quote article said CDC going provide ""guidance teachers know students vaccinated parents know teachers immunized."" CDC punting problem. Traditionally, I'd think vaccine records would kept nurse's offices protect privacy I'm dummy internet idea. percentage schools US actually closed reopening? past year worked restaurant type club literally precautions care masks, would shocked covid one point, 1st dose fine, 2nd days Went today   Correct covid happened student stopped recieving key things IEP including physical therapy implying people wearing masks inside clubs NYC Amsterdam that’s issue? must realize ridiculous sounds right? Would side effects booster shot far worse generating many antibodies? second one really seem pleasant many already. Hospitals staffed holding tight employees have. hard decision administration make; even nurse trust vaccines warm body take shifts week. expect hospitals start lean way couple it. live republican stronghold nearby hospital system announced employees required vaccine next 2 months; expect hospital system follow lead. I'd like think saved getting hospitalized even death. I'm surprised able make 15 months vaccination get it, least think ever got it. feel protected anything long term worse happening family also vaccinated. suspect one thing governments thinking idea Boris Johnson tactless enough say loud: better ""exit wave,"" wave inevitably comes lifting restrictions, summer fall. Everyone wave 2020 weather got cold, idea perhaps avoid seasonal effects COVID spread.

In theory, gamble might still work get wave September, one thing seems clear now, necessarily get decide waves happen, wave guarantee bigger one later. students sent back first otherwise arent recieving OT PT massively important them. students serious health issues (ie completely non verbal, wheel chair bound etc) person entire school year without exception. DOs doctor MDs Yeah live, BC, Canada, gov't recently moved new phase. Outdoor festivals restrictions. Indoor 50 max 50% capacity, whichever higher. Masks required recommended, especially undervaccinated.

What likely happen blossoming cases 78% least one dose, 30% fully vaccinated think.

Have wait another week. far stable could take off. think CDC ""followed science"", completely ignored dynamics schools psychology school kids.

California still going require masks everyone think California got right time best way protect school kids COVID-19.

First, going kids seen Trump influencers running around without masks who'll question need wear masks get vaccinated (ignoring fact Trump got very, sick COVID-19 refused wear mask, plus later quietly got vaccinated).

Second, two groups students, masked unmasked, masked students basically signaling everyone parents anti-vax, anti-mask likely strongly conservatives.

Or likely large cohort unvaxxed students also refusing wear masks. guarantee lots schools sources COVID-19 outbreaks Fall.   That’s you’re wrong. “right” putting others peoples’ life danger no, entitled right. 

You want live civilized society benefits, respect rules don’t endanger others. you’re fine that, like said go live somewhere woods like caveman, nobody’s forcing vaccinate able enjoy said benefits. problem guidelines sound like excuses everyone throw safety measures window. push something like voluntary mask use? many people actually go testing?

Heck, many first world countries terribly well front.  good imagine get flu shots yearly well HPV vaccines. 
It reasonable suspicious untested medicine. one already got covid, would one dose enough? Ahahaha got fucking wrecked worked office building first floor vaccine clinic. Per CDC guidelines, healthcare facility socially distance wear masks even though separate (different floor) entrance one first floor allowed beyond security. yeah, definitely required hospitals. Definitely! situation Indonesia getting quite bad single-digit percentage population fully vaccinated none mRNA vaccines generally efficacious, look like get better time soon. think year half global pandemic politicians would learned finally listen scientists nope, know better. everyone acts surprised numbers soar again... talking health care workers required things like washing hands, endangering lives others, cutting patient’s right leg left leg amputated, wearing mask required law, vaccinated protect lives patients. TF talking about?  *have* mandate vaccines... That's like weatherman believe clouds exist. fuck wrong people...  funny hiw picked 50 59yo group exactly ones count. said till 50yo. above.

The 7 day average reported 3,392 new cases agree pushed back 2022. Really don’t understand hard do. already once.

Both summer winter games used held year anyways. Yes, make 2½G sure think get tell live? Sounds bit authoritarian me.    can’t compare states without accounting variables. state multiple international ports airports? state large percentage migrant workers. state trusted numbers reported? state “play” numbers like reporting vs reporting elderly death without covid test. sprawling, massive urban centers spread rural communities.

The simple fact apples apples comparison would CA without restrictions CA restrictions, timeframe, that’s never works. There’s simply many variables beyond logical conclusion. 

A generic conclusion show, statistically, states mandates mask wearing slow curve projected growth rates vs states not. see positive change 1-2 percentage points states strongest mask mandates. contrary. took pandemic seriously entire time. I’m anti rules mitigation measures means. responding comment clearly suggests government knows far better what’s good do… 

I think limits government power. rights don’t get completely scrapped there’s virus. people get power emergency people decide emergency begins ends…. Legislators make laws , health boards… valid discussion doesn’t make “an extremist”  booster never needed japan’s vaccination rate at? Also, Japan always compliant mask Wearing. assume masks ineffective variant? We're 40% that, two months ago almost 100%. That's shocking. Granted, vaccination rate 70%, get lots weekend tourists anti-vaxx strongholds. Yeah suppose so. judge countries easily without reading it. Except maybe USA.. Also read somewhere Delta variant transmissable deadly. Although doubt last mutation.

All one vaccine companies already developing booster shot many people even taken first shots yet.

I know much though people seem laks.. however spell that. care.. cares right? white people fine every single one healthy slim wonderful genetics. happen all.  /s people gonna get Covid Japan won’t able compete all. It’s certainty must buses hit cross living room kitchen...

deniers weird. **vein**

nice, bloody good pun that. literally campaign 'Dancing Janssen' luring people Janssen vaccine could go dancing night. Legally... underestimate people cheated system pretty fucked well.  People really underestimate valuable healthy is. Even die, there's 10% chance developing long COVID. also chance, albeit smaller, QoL drastically affected via things like losing sense taste smell.

I'd rather wait longer till get vaccinations rather risk things. kevlar drastically reduces chances dying bullet hit.

Hold on, extremely obscure comparisons I’d like pull ass, play game too? hate say it, separate ward covid patients full vaccination (ie. suffering breakthrough infections). Heaven hell moved save folks everything right. least US, would think people would've learned 9/11 formation TSA, causing trouble plane asking it. plane, flight attendants complete authority you, period.   Thank saving trouble responding absolutely help herd immunity, efficacy rates appear differ substantially. Let's look ""delta"" variant mutations occurred nature. T478k, P681R, L452R. 3 points genome, ""nature"" changed nucleotide, insert information sequences. 

The 12 nucleotide insert S1/S2 exist either ""pangolin"" RatG13 CovCZ45. 

Where come from? ""pangolin"" answer.

Occam's razor  Cringe realize Netherlands far behind vaccinations. America, yes, believe venues open without restrictions. position restrictions lifted everyone (adults) chance get vaccinated.  Scary headlines great getting people click them, generates revenue. Scary articles great getting people come back. 

Look advice world medical institutions, rather someone online news outlet interpreted study, ""counter-point"" interview said we're doomed. think wearing masks winter someone sick normalized, like many Asian countries  remains hygienic. Yes, call ""society"". living it. cities towns did. big population centers mask mandates. Even amusements parks required masks.

The narrative DeSantis pushes inaccurate misleading. bc he's amoral idiot mean true every municipality/business FL.

Ex:  idk first dose pfizer still effective 3 weeks. Lets real, people unvaccinated cheating system. timing perfect, cancer survivor would high risk. streamed New Years Eve party tons people mask. Jan 1st Jan 30 perfect timing symptoms progresses needing emergency O2 (Which get). hear, lot doctors won’t even give patients AZ Australia (they’re waiting Pfizer/Bion). think 50 year olds. NSW needs new leadership, imo. us still wearing masks! 😃 What's breakdown first second doses? What's vaccination rate per capita? There’s places human rights constitutional liberties barrier . It’s perfect spineless cowards . people charge know what’s best every aspect life. 

As far covid , we’ll never really know, good bad suppose Guys too..first injection, week night panik attacks (never Them.in life) first 3/4 days random empty head feeling, strong heartbeat (not fast...strong) empty sensation upper stomach hope recovers well enough able dance again. Except CDC officially advises testing vaccinated mention controversial decision lower CT requirements NAAT testing vaccinated persons quickly retracted going viral running counter health promotion efforts CDC. 

Additionally, counts “case” COVID longer includes Asymptomatic “mild” symptoms; standards exist beginning pandemic, means cases majority people go unnoticed deliberately untested for.  That's crazy, idea far behind. see sides argument here. shouldn’t holding Olympics is. should’ve canceled. happy gyms opened again, they'll probably close :( graph used normal axis, would barely see change groups 30. Check coronadashboard.government.nl wiping voters get votes strategy… right. I've always wanted live Maine. live Florida now. asking cause heard otherwise. trust news anyone covid. Regardless see reason lockdown right performed different times STRONG evidence mRNA vaccines higher efficacy overall. J&amp;J trials took place alpha variant starting take hold, efficacy rate 60s places alpha variant. Real world studies looked effective mRNA vaccines Alpha, found 90%. Even Delta, mRNA vaccines efficacy rate 80s infection, extremely likely J&amp;J's efficacy still significantly lower. without vaccines. asked Netherlands know long available age groups. Yes typical Covid news, want keep people far away vaccines because... know, anti vax people click it? Denmark, faking coronapas = forgery including punishment follows. Crazy people would risc go *clubbing*

Our restrictions relaxed, clubs still closed, restaurents close 24:00 cases nearly double almost everyday week. It’s happening. get wrong, anyone vaccinated, get vaccinated. However, risk get vaccinated FIRST, assuming supply meet demand. definitely don’t pair goggles tbh  I’m worried virtual elementary school third year students honest distance thing barely active rules still active. People keep distance, wore masks wrong (not covering nose) all.. Ah well.. thing that’s studies, need doses vaccine order protected high rate protection Prob Euro cup caused superspreader events study found antibodies previous infections vaccinations less effective Delta variant Alpha variant. actually means real world risk infection reinfection unclear, could imply Delta break immune systems resistant Alpha. Seems like delta variant escaped antibodies prior covid infection single dose vaccine, two doses vaccine still generated neutralizing antibodies.

Somebody correct interpreted incorrectly, read pretty quickly phone. reason people respond majority people read article headline. people freaking comments they're fucked can't believe they've duped reality incredibly limited risk. something tip people getting vaccine. 2/3 country fully vaccinated. Great question.

From I've come understand, typical process new pathogen reaches humans. antibody naive strain population. develop antibodies community, spread slow down. great job, rare like measles. don't, become seasonal like flu (more likely), depending long antibodies last.

But, first time history abilities combat new pandemic. would say damage response worse traditional ways, virus would caused tremendously damage occured 200 years ago. problem people mixing, even minimal symptoms, likely see another variant evolve. Delta least slowed large scale vaccinations (well 2nd dose 2 weeks least) new variant stage could mean even less effectiveness. Politics v science v public welfare difficult balance, even take account population ready throw caution good time businesses needing make money again. Hey one those!  I’ll honest, thought person sarcastic. look Rutte's career long line admitting wrong. People surprised now... Given nothing else passed trials yet yes. issue see large number people already fence barely convinced get vaccine. Add boosters start parroting ""just like flu shot work"" garbage. Subscription model I've heard rhetoric several times past year... without exception, people either believe pandemic all, think ""God take care me"" science-based restrictions place. hope one those... comment slightly misleading though. cases evenly distributed across ages, risk significantly higher young males. Wait, suppose sleep night? caused spread tho... stupid part... u look regions greatest number cases: maharashtra etc elections pilgrimage there... point, let people make risk calculation move lives.

And that's hundreds hundreds thousands needlessly died COVID last 18 months. Hahahaha, made laugh.. Thanks  huge Dutch gang last 2 Austrian GPs Spielberg would like say word. vaccines graph. 

Just need people vaccinated Yeah definitely made huge error here. would better wait couple weeks untill people got second dose Jansen.

About southern question, since ”India” common name entite subcontinent since least Mughal Empire (1500s), exonym long that, don’t think people southern India problem it. know Tamil nationalists usually don’t call Indian don’t want part state India, it’s offensive anything.

Fun note: ancestors Tamils probably bath Indus. Indus valley civilization likely spoke dravidian language, Dravidians lived throughout entire Indian subcontinent Arian migrations (nowadays live southern India except small pockets elsewhere) 3500 years ago. unfortunate none countries highly effective containing Covid-19 able avoid complacency need get population vaccinated. bit puzzled quick negative reaction Pfizer's booster plans. Even think boosters needed, ""it's better need need it"". Apparently would prefer wait know booster needed, *then* start manufacturing distributing booster? Let's proactive once.

I saw somewhere testing third dose raising antibody levels 5-10 times higher second dose. restoring antibody levels declined time, going well beyond original levels. translates well increased effectiveness, point protecting us well Delta original Wuhan strain, would huge win. get people work health care industry trust medical portion it.  vaccine help? Yes. end war? Definitely generation vaccine. China really suck bad country western propaganda. I'm too. Find annoying anyone passes old ages seem matter reason. inviting everyone come over? vaccinated rotation known Europe much known certain fields needed left fallow year weed crops we're grown

Two- three-fields systems literally modes crop rotation. like Indians better knowledge soil chemistry, reason blame Europeans ""just knowing leave alone"". also ""three sisters"" method planting corn, beans squash grown side side permaculture, kept soil productive still providing complete diet.

For one, method also work kind mechanization (plowing domesticated animals included), dead-end large-scale agriculture. used animals North America have, fertilized feces.

So? domesticated used them. America llamas used moving burdens quite time (since insist mentioning potato little NA). need it.

So? didn't, overall development agriculture went way. Looks like low population density high yield cultures helps need stuff. Americans using cover crops Europeans showed up. know sure long before, before.

Would really nice get good source it. one, growing beans cover crops growing beans part ""three sisters"" looks strange. corn garbage

So? Wild apples small sour. Wild olives nowhere near one get shop nowadays. Wild wheat looses grains easily, domestication included making sturdier, end half harvest left field (people literally fight way plants itself). straight poison native Americans fixed them.

If remember correctly, tubers wild potato relatively edible even consumed raw (and sure - properly cooked), ""a deadly plant turned miraculous food"". good reason tuber part consume nowadays. and/or ancestral wheats bulgar, spelt, farro others perfectly edible sold wheat aisle grocery store. They're slightly less productive mainstream varieties, they're flavorful tend disease resistant.

I think people ever domesticated something really poisonous eat it. Either already least partially edible, domesticated needs found good eat it. all, green part potato (the poisonous one wild) still used much. 
And hope understand listed domesticated species (just less optimized), bulgur even grain - dish made wheat. boats particularly important them. were, amazing things, part build permanent structures need boats go beyond couple miles shore.

Great comment, reassuring! ❤️ switched talking something else. saying rise positive tests represent actual rise cases Ahahahahahahahahhaha, truly brainwashed rather hit car COVID hahahaa   Give everyone N99 mask, fit properly make take even second. see don’t work then. That's assuming two comment section even saying truth. believe random strangers internet. Exactly point. I'm Aussie waiting become eligible. made comment rollout messed got removed.  Eh, ordinary Russians overwhelmingly support Putin government have. wanted. Die Bart die people really still fence shot? I'm morbidly obese got Moderna shot. sore arm near injection site.  Embarrassing. delete comment Even scarier fact game playing—the large scale, industrialized society game—is new game that. We’ve recently started playing around thing call civilization. monolith blueprint thing we’re doing. young learning crawl. Problem is, one’s watching us, teaching us, steering us. could well run thing right cliff know better. 

I feel like lot people take life granted afraid think beyond immediate lives. Truth one driving car, living run away train. We’re deep playing civilization we’ve forgotten are, too, animals vying survival. 

Industrialized society existed hundred years. modern society decades. absolute blink eye. one showing us way, either. little game experiment could, probably will, come crashing wake realize, oh yea, life given. people lulled dream life earth end all.

I think case, we'd better position. unfortunately swinging fantasy afterlife earth expendable stepping stone eternal paradise.

The evangelicals want rapture, reasons think. we've built civilization them, want us gone. scorch planet make happen, thus white Christian survivors apocolypse. 
 diagnosed doctor yourself? Death.. Chicken pox throat???!!!! Omg that’s terrifying!!! That’s one first vaccines kids got. husband tried shame “they’d better getting chicken pox. shot make sick.” I’m aware there’s risk getting chicken pox severe adult. protection available, fuck yes protect kids polio chicken pox whooping cough. worry delta variant proven lethal original covid 19.. 

Smart. mean end talking product  it’s temporary thing? Well, lot friends family teach public schools. Let's say school would pull quarantine fall spring due student exposure, magically cases never reported schools website public reporting. never trusted numbers coming public schools. 
Also, mom works healthcare office high percentage snow birds. see lot Covid...but county still low case counts. Seems odd, dont think non-residents counted Florida report anymore counted elsewhere? mess. hate living wish able move. mom masks thrown patients, I've seen anti mask public freakouts, done. also 18 month old cautious sucks.... Vaccines don’t stop infection. Never have. silly anyone thinks do, past year I’m surprised. virus still gets body start replicate, get positive test. point body immediately tools fight instead developing them, cuts time body kill significantly, means very, low chance hospitalization death. 

It’s like go stores signs pictures people written bad checks. Without vaccine (or previous infection), store/your body lets bad people takes bad check unknowingly. vaccine bad guy still gets counter, can’t use bad check. told leave. 

They still get cases, can’t real damage one case. Long Covid one, loss work performance another. Causing mutations also point feel sorry immunocompromised folks can't get shot. Everyone else US could one now. think taking measure protect people clearly said OK dying covid passing others. feel sorry single one them. Lucky ducked.  'but even Europe, still 30-40% unvaccinated population'. Yes, unvaccinated population mostly young people, unlikely get hospitalized. people choose get vaccinated, choice. like deliveries stop enough 70%... understand that, firmly believe active cases real indicator current state.
Throughout pandemic, many ups downs daily cases... think reflects reality. 

People take vaccine fucking relax. know works. know side effects minimum. 

Also, mainstream media really wants milk Rona much possible, yeah, delta variant not, people take jab, fine. Yes, happened well. another example: 50% Fully Vaxed ""Currently under-25s account infections they, De Jonge said, parents grandparents infect. addition, said, three million people vaccinated immune problems make vaccine less effective. Youngsters made ill coronavirus, said, end hospital. 25% under-25 report complaints three months, according research public health institute RIVM."" Canada try opening things again. don’t understand don’t look elsewhere see poorly goes there. form lockdown year now. keep shooting feet. vaccination rates ? quite high still fear open early numbers sky rocket. Especially without mandatory vaccine enter places.  Live MS. confirm. Chinese weapon confirming Trump correct, completely harmless. 

Amongst ""men"" around seems like macho thing... like taking vaccine sign weakness.

The nicest thing living population low almost never actually interact meaningfully them. Live MS. confirm. Chinese weapon confirming Trump correct, completely harmless.

The nicest thing living population low almost never actually interact meaningfully them. missing point. personally referring BBC. words pertain one outlet. aunt live FL. called tell get vaccine. checked conspiracy theories reason(s). explained respect choices pregnant wife getting vaccine (and did).

My problem: got mom's head. parents live Dominican Republic. Shit's crazy there. Ppl truly give fuck. 

Gave mom 3 choices baby comes Oct: get vaxxed, come states quarantine 2 weeks + covid test even see us come all.

Fuck aunt. Fuck FL. Respectfully. mean need one dose partial immunity still two? I’m waiting get vaccine now, I’m even nervous now.  Could psychosomatic. bet lot people feel symptoms reading  Covid downvoted Speak Slow boat. variant contagious necessarily harmful deadly individual. Sorry country like Australia can't make zero Covid works, China lying us right now. Stop propaganda please. There’s estimated 7500 generations modern human beings Earth. one wants believe generation could either final penultimate one… we’re totally wrecking planet pollution depletion natural resources. small minds believe world vast, don’t think could run clean water breathable air, change global climate one couldn’t sustain modern civilization.

Our grandchildren aren’t going great world rate… Sorry meant vaccines approved US. saying got vaccine? screenshot active cases, think talking new cases, see starting go bit.   already unvaccinated Olympic athletes Japan. sure it’s reported news, newspaper reporter Asahi Shinbun ( actually sponsor Tokyo 2020) [tweeted (in Portuguese Canoe team told unvaccinated plan get shots games. 

In fact, IOC announced 85% delegation vaccinated [(Reuter article there’ll unvaccinated folks arriving Japan. must go r/eyebleach purge negativity darkened heart Study came Thailand saying Sinovac isn’t effective Delta.

Usually good data certain aspects human behavior hard come can't easily controlled studies data people always find way get data. Like they'll use weird events like mass adoption Korean children going different families first come first served. imagine many weird pieces data pandemic generated. Respiratory therapy students might risk outcomes dealing patient cohort absolutely be!

Vaccination never made political issue - we'd much along been. True despite downvotes Fair - given way older people globally vaccine. 

Still, really matter since risks still heavily skewed. way better get vaccinated risk mild inflammation heart go hospital treat it, let covid spread.

Risks common counter medication higher worse fuss - warn people packaging. people driving cases, causing rise, people vaccinated. agree, hope al people mindlessly protesting wake now.

Probably though... August 1st it’ll come Bible Belt, aka areas lowest vax rates, spike infections/hospitalizations/deaths.
I can’t predict numbers. don’t even work numbers.

But I’m educated adult read news. I’ve follow covid since beginning. one sounding alarm amongst friends Italy Spain fell hard fast, many Americans thought “well won’t happen here”

So I’m informed enough understand covid, work like flu, natural spike come fall winter anyway. combine like 70% certain states populations vaxxed. information right connect dots realize states going shit ton trouble especially coming fall.

And baffles knowledge even downvoted. Like triggered death bad news downvote it? See evil read evil attitude?   you’re wrong. “right” putting others peoples’ life danger no, entitled right. 

Not vaccinated put others risk. mixing others vaccinated that.

It's absolutely right vaccinated. stay properly isolated, that's fine. 

You actually want lose rights bodily autonomy think it. affects rights contraception, abortion, appropriate medical care, tattoos, body mods on.

What would decided people right refuse vaccine? enforce would arrest refusers administer force.  That's completely outside what's acceptable. 

Buuuut... said, people right protected antivax cult members. think existing health safety law businesses duty care take reasonable steps protect service users. Personally think excluding vaccine refusers reasonable step. hope courts agree me. majority workers vaccinated already. another poster mentioned news making mandatory co-workers vaccinated lose job. public health perspective, argue safety precautions “Swiss cheese method.” 

You assume every safety precaution limitations (the holes Swiss cheese) stack layers (safety precautions) one another reduce size holes line up. insignificant compared previous waves. Last time many cases 10 times many deaths. course every death tragedy talking going witness another huge wave fatalities scaremongering. Virol load. Also point it’s unvaccinated going hospital dying. people remove masks air travel drink beverages eat snacks. I’ve flights people rocking masks chins. specify consequences?  18 under, likely contract Myocarditis/Pericarditis (inflammation heart) vaccine, die really like math works) hospitalizations severe illness? Cases dont matter much vaccinated population. Mercy unvaccinated! Sure . helps us want live. 😁 Completely giving cultural victory means go domination win I'd really rather not. symptoms? EU kept exporting around half vaccines manufactured exported around 500 million vaccines. [China exported around 400 297899$ sir... sir? Dr. Fauci said ""extremely rare"" though. real problem unvaccinated. nervous trash articles like one knowingly unintentionally gaslight people generate clicks  Yep, also advancements make hit environment. Plastic wonderful technological advancement, long term consequences biological health horrendous. 

I would love technological advancements took biosphere consideration, I'm holding breath. thing matters. cases deaths unlinked, case numbers don’t matter anymore. initial bit said "" variant nasty"", say ""this variant nastier death rate higher"". things equal, variant infectious indeed going nastier going difficult control spread of, unless handled accordingly, would also infect people (and kill people).

You're trying strawman original statement.

Reading comprehension lost art... Yeah, sympathize cannot get shit due bad immune systems. rest, anti vaxers/conspiracy theorists refuse take it? catch get worst. care anymore. World better place without them. say despite knowing several people like that. Tired stupidity try make sure days afterwards rest recover. second shot Monday afternoon, aside arm pain kind chilled bed played video games watched movies like Thursday lol, kind lethargic much else Still important put perspective people still believe, enough. Well, say ""fuck society"", current Dutch government made repeated disastrous policy decisions. case, even fully knew risks people mingle without wait two weeks last vaccine, enabled anyway. top fact waiting people vaccinated always better idea. Thus, aforementioned politicians deserve consequences careers. chances true small would willing bet get diagnosis doctor. literally 99.99999% chance right.  bad people used new normal. would know “lifelong” antibodies? “Most” people US fully vaccinated…. half country fully vaccinated, something like 68% partially vaccinated, plus got previously infected. 

Idk you, doesn’t scream people walking around precautions can't. would like live third world. fair hugely less effective first shot, second less effective symptomatic infection, much less death hospitalizations. 

So likely get sick, still much less likely die get seriously sick, like original variant, second dose.  [A third shot necessary right What's necessary people get second.  far herd immunity concerned, OK 30% stay unvaccinated. large portion develop natural immunity catching covid (even develop long covid). assume conservatively half go way, 85% immunity, almost level needed suppress disease like measles way infectious covid. countries actually substantial amount people vaccinated. I’ve started thanking willingly unvaccinated finding solution climate crisis. look faces priceless  news cases grown massively UK link hospitalisations death broken.

That *the* news. Turns tap image enhances quality phone. know helps respectful manner / mature way concern disapproval certain situation instead adding constant "" Fuck X "" end comment.
Not gonna lie, I'm going fed end posts, point still stands feel like ""fuck society"" quite necessary sane discussions. free disagree though. Vaccinated people still have, pass covid. sound deranged read article says start autumn, theoretically everyone wants doses chances get then. 99% people can’t read clinical study actually understand it. 

That includes Reddit well... Don’t like getting downvoted here, people really want keep spending lives indoors? hi Mr Sky News employee. Except seems kids become Democrats witnessing parental delusions. believe vaccines there's long term study vaccine. Yes safe short term there's long term history vaccine. That's reason pause concern people. idea kind side effects might facing 2-4 years. Fuck. Thank you. isn’t works can’t believe comment upvotes.

Antibodies wane cells body help produce infected, still offers protection even detectable antibodies start waning body. Exhibit access internet definitely guarantee correct information knowing interpret it. 

I know I've anti maskers confidently argue water vapor particle larger viruses, (it gas, H2O molecule) can't filter water vapor can't filter virus. 

I can't believe people exist do. Confidently wrong extreme way. even grasp basic scientific knowledge grade schooler know.  know me, quality bad can't read linked wonder team wants wait after? Lol! *are* sneaky they?! Exactly. end august could vaccinate whole population September every adult country using mRNA vaccines (Like example Norway) Kick team. Probably. health problems preventing vaccination know common is. reassess strategy share platform Talibans. China make work much easier Australia. lot tighter every aspect mention they're probably major country completely locked areas. 

Coupled ability build 1000+ bed field hospital less week, ability quarantine hard. things western country can't even dream imitate, logistically ethically. Thank friend. Ooof, I’m getting beer sorting controversial. Yes, I'm 100% confident new mutations coming, looks like fighting chance dumb stubborn/ignorant getting sick dying, be. Hopefully people win darwin awards. stupidity I've seen last year staggering. getting faster, yes.

The virus already incredibly good spreading. flu mutates time nobody says transmissible. situation South Carolina?

Don't forget people health issues make vaccine inadvisable impossible.   share infections Poland Delta variant?

If 50% Poland well. less 50%, reason. Netherlands seems rather unfortunate timing re-opening happen *exactly* (well, exactly, near) Delta takes main variant. many people already caught antibodies.      It’s common sense. want cure every issue face humans simultaneously wanting put forth effort positively affect health. mere 2-3 generations ago idea flying across ocean giant metal bird sending instantaneous messages anyone world via global communications network impossible fantasies. We’ve hit point exponential growth technology. Florida population 21.48 million. So, we're looking 0.00015% population per day. wanted put there. Yes course realize that, like said richest per capita. US lot richer terms absolute amounts, matters here. I'm talking Europe either, India Indonesia got completely fucked covid. vaccines earlier might Delta variant. 

The point vaccines simply distributed fair way, see deny dispute that. saying NL fucked many vaccines US utterly ridiculous. US, Israel UK first fuck covid let spread hoarded metric fuck ton vaccines. usual powerlifting workouts following first dose concern back mind, completely fine little weaker usual 3-4 days. said, aunt died severe form myocarditis whilst flu, perhaps caution would best approach second jab. Thank explaining me.  mutations: yes make trade-off point. seem desirable live Covid-fear indefinitely. 

About long-covid: fair point, research must make clear then. many people long? Still, alleviate restrictions point. Yup look case numbers going crazy. Around 70% whole country received 1 dose least since vaccines use preventing hospitalization death tolls stark contrast fairly low.  That's beginning Fwiw Australia currently 9.6%, 15.5% looking hospitalisations vs cases week ago (to compensate lag).

In largely unvaccinated highly traced populations looking *very* rough far. Every age group represented ICU, teens upwards, 440 odd cases.

No fully vaccinated hospital handful elderly observation though. Maybe stupid question variants getting faster faster possible kills spreads quickly? suck sir speak Gospel Lol Good luck treatment! Twice many people US get struck lightning 18 kids dying covid....facts, all

Struck lightning \~ 650 per yr US

18 Covid deaths - 325

&amp;#x200B;

and 3X many kids suffered heart inflammation vaccine number covid deaths age group would anyone downvote comment??? It’s 100000000% accurate Like cruise ship?  It'll never matter enough people. many together throughout country individual experience different. worst like 1 1000 people dying mostly older folks, maybe 1 10,000 less younger people. denial write see day day. denial even 1/300, 1/200 people dying might personally see one two people die vaguely care about, easy write off. 

Our social networks personal level big often equal distribution. One family might 3+ deaths others none etc. 

Also know several people covid deaths.

My friends dad died covid funeral family joking elegy ""voting liberal"" (as dead person) insane. (I recall deceased calling liberal plot embarrass president covid first broke well...) 

This blue collar trumpism really convinces people hospitalizations deaths? people probably notice effects report it. flagrantly ignore science, sudden believe think ""supports"" bullshit. Thinking extremely difficult anti-vaxxers.

They're going ignore actual numbers statistics, read headline believe figured out. might take step read facebook post lolol. That's it.  hard put faith technological savior. Human social evolution accomplish lot, I'm sure that's likely. Depending severity yes. Pneumonia ^j/k Even degree false positives, it’s improbable numbers would rise substantially without actual rise amount positive cases. I’m sure really test this. Even 20-30% people fully vaccinated greatly affect spread effect virus. always many intervening variables hard measure separate out. weird move ensure everyone MUST love working home. Spoiler alert despise Yes. typically resolves OTC anti inflammatory meds symptoms. people 29 avoid heavy cardiovascular workouts exercise 5 days second dose doses want extra cautious. I'm immunocompromised got shot. active virus vaccine.  Nice see Simpsons reference wasted. Thanks Moe. Severe chest burning/tightness, especially lying flat, relieved sitting forward Guessing think would mess training. There's still issue pupils schools. younger ones can't get vaccinated yet, rate vaccinations older school children great. could make schools ""hot spots"" lots people get infected short time. Well, Missouri rank 42nd healthcare according US News World Report. never get this. new cold 100 times worse. lot fraud negative tests many bouncers even look all, assuming would safe. ***do*** know, that's thing. That's exactly many strains. Viruses mutate. mysterious area science. know fact.  tragic lead horse water. worst case scientists warned us reopenings first discussed even bothering explain you, let’s go: 

No vaccine = higher chance getting spreading covid. Vaccine passport venues = less chance someone covid spreads people inside venue means less chance spreading throughout community even bothering explain you, let’s go: 

No vaccine = higher chance getting spreading covid. Vaccine passport venues = less chance someone covid spreads people inside venue means less chance spreading throughout community  different sub-populations. 82yo aunt full esoteric health stuff, all-natural diet get vaccinated matter long reason her. 

But there's also redneck-type anti-vaxxers who'd rather shove burgers celery sticks. ever hear Delta variant, mean nobody talking it? Anything bash Americans guess..  USA big, us well north 70% population vaccinated, mask anymore. wonder Japan going look like, Olympics elderly population lack vaccines get clobbered Delta? Yeah, pandemic broke people’s brains Florida need health countermeasures vaccinated going follow.

This problem caused low vaccination fixed vaccinations (which unfortunately Florida governor also seems opposed though). trolling really necessary here?

I got could stop wearing mask everywhere. Simple. Highly highly doubt vaccine related. hormone regulates heart beat, unless maybe abnormal thyroid value causing arrhythmia. severely elevated cardiac enzymes (which would reason ER would say thought heart attack) would hospitalized angiogram, least echo nuclear study. peri/myocarditis, would done similar seen evidence bloodwork

He probably chest pain unrelated heart, they're thorough. Drinking, cigarettes, fast food, lack exercise many things life also consequences we're preventing everyone things, we?
You sound like life perfect place 0 risk Yep 100% equivalent ""doctors HATE one trick thats putting business! BELIEVE this! Click here.!""

Definitely worded outrage clicks speculative details. 

Although say seen word ""anonymous"" bill mentioned spokesperson concerning regardless survey about. full article Times says isn’t going case till mid/late September everyone chance doubled vaccinated guess technically still ""life long"" die way sooner. Percentages involving death probably stay same.  quantity cases higher.  number deaths higher,but compares percentage.

Why would bill requiring universities take surveys viewpoint diversity comfort students faculty feel expressing beliefs struck down? university system pushed back bill. permanent? people lost lives actively denying it. necessarily stupid go clubbing? show negative covid test meant infectious. Aa far I'm concerned that's even less risk going bar evening (which require test).
Now course appears system meant check covid test results broken, that's fault people followed rules got tested, it? It’s push get people back physical workplaces driving mindset. Money people  gotta supply knobs Cases matter, spread people particularly new variant transmissible.

They're also tons people get sick lingering issues never go hospital.

Nope, problem, theirs/yours. walking. killed yourself. Excuse laugh people willingly walk cliff, loudly.  think disease ever going go away again.

Unfortunately, people could lose entire family still deny covid real. Many events get preemptively cancelled organised uncertainty. get scared. That’s media does. That’s anti vax, it’s statistics. said anti vax? ActualNin incorrect. Pre-infection par 1 vaccine jab pre-infection + 1 jab exceeds double jabbing (without pre-infection) 6x. find studies you.

However, say reported statistics probably lower really is. got second shot April people told subreddits anxiety palpitations high resting heart rate vaccine. doc agrees probably myocarditis even though don’t official tests evidence prove it. vaccine statistics using hospital cases/tests severe ones. it’s good usually isn’t severe side effect, keep mind there’s probably lot unreported cases like mine people doubting making think overthinking symptoms.

(Yes, long covid issue, think soon figure cure it.) EU came successful end. happy this. rocky start, things looked uncertain moment, currently right track. Learned mistakes. Go EU. one forced take vaccines covid either - least parts Europe. 

What saying society try get many people vaccinated quickly possible, safer efficient way herd immunity. man ventilator, humanity really comparing polio covid ? case polio vaccination, whatever age range, benefits outweighted risks. That's true covid. either get vaccine risk maybe getting mild heart inflammation, get COVID likely get moderate-severe heart organ inflammation extended period time+risk losing two senses months years+risk ending ventilator weeks months.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Similar Rubella Polio... Worse whooping cough smallpox.. Honest question anyone knows well enough say definitely, know vaccine point. took population everyone got myocarditis got vaccine previous comment says 0.0001% population. I'm assuming regular population vaccinated people sub group also occasionally happen percentage grater 0 even 0, 0.0001% likely enough say theres link? mean assume proved somehow I'm understanding how. vaccines widely believed give much stronger immunity antibodies virus infection. yes difference. 

Having large part population ill never good, especially chance new severe mutations emerging. Good thing Florida done incredibly well vaccinating elderly population. far highest population 65, Florida done fantastic job compared states. Though got governors like Cuomo actively putting covid positive patients nursing homes, becomes lot easier exceed states responded illogically.  Hmmm.. that's alright. could threaten sex!  Joe Rogan said Canada insane they’re dealing Corona Florida way better.  Good question know. Analyzing would lead lot variance modeling think, delaying jeopardizing EUA. It'd make sense FDA isolated benefit risk analysis individual level. needs understood ""viral load case detected PCR"" rather ""peak viral load."" seems paper linked saying incubation period shorter delta, meaning replicates faster body, reaching higher levels sooner. results higher level detected case first tested. 1000 seems like lot, remember exponential growth, representing extra day two worth virus growth.  go doctors?

Got moderna second shot. 5 days passed rest heart beat stabilizing. still feel pain heart area mild exercising, stop working out. hope disappears. 22 years old, athletic male.

I go doctors, since baltics issues them, personally conflicts. overweight even encourage exercising. issues need go since 16 years old, started healthy lifestyle then. healthcare worker red antivax state, would seriously planning move point, already done it. ""Moderna Pfizer coronavirus vaccines linked mild heart inflammation."" 

There ya go. Fixed headline. mean deadly?

WHATS DIFFERENCE ONE. started detecting recent weeks, mostly goes unreported It’s half assed vax rates live. cases deaths high vax rate. goes northeast. reason shouldn’t open. people choosing get driven lot US policies propagandizing, especially insistence pandemic even though high levels uncontrolled spread lot unvaccinated people. We’ve created context people think decide “pandemic them,” even though collective consequence worse outcomes everyone, evident reduced vaccine efficacy dangerous variants continuing spread. Tldr - vaccine reduces chances getting spreading - get head. bring transmission rate 1 virus longer spread amongst population argument spreading regardless makes sense. Actually, since want dick, live US I'm required wear mask gotten shots. US CDC changed stance months ago. sure France.   I'm sorry mess.

Lets see long term brings. companies people believe religiously sure seem confident clairvoyant abilites.... Seriously? vaccinate healthy protect sick. Polio eliminated normal parents vaccinated healthy kids end minuscule chance catching polio. parents stopped vaccinating children polio ALMOST eliminated would still see children get today.

The redidiot comments “the truth” eliminated things like measles planet surface.  There's magical threshold linked not. odd thinking. Florida still significant amount unvaccinated people vulnerable, vaccinated vulnerable people too. course numbers bad relative cases, unlinked. unlinked anywhere. think like dangerous unknown, even everyone Fauci's office vaccinated questioned...only roughly half. No, I'm right confirmed it; still spread despite amount word salad use avoid saying coming varying levels transmission rate.

See, matter whether vaccine reduces transmission, that's issue still spread regardless. matters reduces severity hospitalitisation key normality.

So, knowing everyone still spread it, knowing everyone still get ill; makes sense use passports. Why?

1) bodily autonomy. want forced. backdoor discrimination unvaccinated.

2) testing using flawed tests manufacturer using unreliable, pointless. seen school kids using lemon juice get positive result 10 days school right? 

3) Say unvaccinated person walks in. Spreads it. vaccinated less likely ill it. unvaccinated likely

4) Children 12 vaccinated. Even Witty said little risk side effects must outweigh effects Covid; there's effects Covid. herd immunity never achieved always spread.

5) Witty asked conference said Uni students need 2 doses September 25s low risk anyway. mind, issue get it, seeing still spread healthy low risk anyway? fail realize, US, well 100 Million natural infections (resulting immunity) PLUS vaccinated. math, combined likely already! Cases deaths 1/20th months ago.  Nobody cares facts anymore.  Sorry, could ask... many days first jab workout? can't take week training, let alone, 3-4 days... would ruin consistency. fine 24 hours first jab?  Bro relatives literally friend die COVID act like nothing happened. Arkansas Mississippi? vaccines tested long enough released public. one wasn't.  Pfizer win I’m dense. don’t get mean. Pls. explain. masks, encourage defense-in-depth solution arrest current rise cases?   hard pessimistic. Even brought back masks brought back strict restrictions think due increased contagiousness Delta we're looking long time go. Vaccines wane, people get sick again. may many years. mention winter flu similar symptoms l. 

Thankfully ""stay home, stay safe"" - still best advice. Could benefits include things like herd immunity, pure illness vs vaccine? I’m talking seriously confused point. Passes ever, different 1% serious ilness 0.001%. 

There 100%, 0%. Everything got error barros uncertainty associated.

It crazy fuck (by global standards) rich educated populatiins grip things black/white binary. Midwest massive place... area mask compliance 100% near entire pandemic. places visited Midwest closer 25% compliance utterly scary Indonesia going right too. fear ASEAN eventually experience this.  know US would point right work states, employers fire anyone almost reason, support idea.

Many would probably complain employers firing anyone vaccinated. Get vaccinated then. Get vaccinated then. claim know more. wanted heads announcement freaked people out. hard answer questions trying play catch what's going on.

Also, neither FDA CDC said booster needed. said booster needed *at time*. really important fully read statements well, know.

Likely boosters thing towards fall winter. That's line Pfizer said- 6-12 months. First shots December. officially file approval booster though, speculation need happen fighting vaccine hesitancy government side. never wear mask again.

Which dumb. realize COVID last pandemic history? analogy make sense. almost dumb analogy ppl get killed car accidents care covid deaths. live linear world. 

Again I'll trust inventer MRNA vaccine read pharmaceutical report Japan received telling people possibility long term effects. believe people taking vaccine point research done unless vulnerable population covid. someone chooses get vaccine antivaxer. lots ppl get flu shots waiting covid shots. vaccine reduces chance getting severe covid 95%. vaccination rate country 75%+ cases single digits. would disservice mental health continue quarantine. Nacogdoches county, 632% increase infections Louie Gohmert US Rep Congress. easy see pattern willful ignorance bad decisions sad hope get shit together. love Nacogdoches, holy crap turning hell hole. ""Virologists conclude"", lol. 

Or accurately...one team virologists, paper literally even submitted journal yet, much less reviewed. 

It's sloppy misleading. makes sound like consensus, far closer ""doctors say drink glass wine daily"" ""climate scientists say earth warming overall"". might true, fuck we're using single pre-prints determine truth things now. one 100% safe anything. Eventually insurance companies start pressuring employers get people vaccinated. Hit people hurts most. Lol Florida trash couldn’t pay live I've tried reasoning people past 18 months , beyond saving. get news Facebook alt right websites, nothing change mind point unless get personally affected. take developed countries investing energy infrastructure countries like India African South American continents. can’t afford country get energy coal fossil fuels. needs happen immediately cost shitload money, we’ve got one planet. fiancé moved Michigan New Mexico (my home) May 2020 holy shit...that whole drive terrifying, relief instead place neighbors going lockdown protests unmasked.

New Mexico may poor state, know science real here. restrictions actually lifted July 1, it’s still common see people masks A) Delta variant, B) children still haven’t vaccinated, C) both. 10 000 new infections means 10 000 people risk long covid, weeks would vaccinated. serious year ago, sadder. Imagine getting long covid now. Yeah. Virus mutate whatever want (with certain limits RNA replication mechanisms, like COVID). implication natural selection let infectious less deadly (killing hosts) thrive, big enough sample allow variation survive. mean ppl always existed, every pandemic, sucks I’m altering them, know medical conditions, thus need take appropriate actions protect themselves, covid going us forever. really need mask forever protect small percentage worlds population. One kids parents microchip thing. I'm like, small think make GPS WiFi chip? mean sure transistor microprocessor tiny days, that's one gate big complicated chip. smallest tracking chips would visible vial could come needle unless size twizzler something...  Death cases lag behind, let's see develops one month now. Vaccines seem curbing deaths Israel UK least. hope 2022 everything truly maskless United States. glad fact vaccinated anymore, really would like see pre-pandemic life return next year. Although feel like totally naive saying that. Nope. guess that's one reason get vaccinated. I've fully vaccinated Pfizer months day 4 sick delta. sucks, manageable counter drugs bed rest. imagine ending hospital without vaccine. point it’s 70% effective severe regular covid vaccines high efficacy less effective delta j&amp;j probably also less effective severe delta covid.

The icing cake false biontech moderna 95 effective asymptomatic covid 85 covid whatsoever flawed, thanks though. Unfortunately, people read sensationalized headlines extrapolate. 

Of course public educated, lot critical information presented really irresponsibly. Pfizer applied authorization third shot vaccine, variant specific booster dose. There’s reason think would increase protection people who’s immunity waned first two doses (that’s pretty much everybody). answer Delta strain UAFA Euro 2020   trolls need go back bridges figure things out.

👍 also fact benefits outweigh risks? That's verifiable, mathematical fact. I'm sure asking. Investigating natural origin virus something routinely done now, extremely hard unless hit lucky. example \*still\* know source Ebola scientists looking couple decades now. \*think\* fruit bats - chimps intermediate - no-one actually knows.

With SARS classic struck lucky finding civits, still took 14 years prove actual origin. MERS oddity nearly 100% camels infected clusters break out. think tin foil hat all. wealthy benefit keeping economy moving along. also receive best treatments for-profit healthcare system. 

And instead holding $6 trillion dollar infrastructure bill might needed see lockdowns, CDC continues declare victory virus. think lot people wore mask, even want to, want spend hour store getting dirty looks, people say shit them. much believe something really believe righteous, also exhausting regular basis. No, doesn't. NEVER doubt virus natural origin. argument. people clue talking manufactured virus. 

I suggest work reading comprehension two ideas mutually exclusive. Damn I'm UK hoping least learn mistake opening up, delay planned final full reopening next week... interferes consumption Mosquitos, mosquitos. Sounds like change governs Florida order determines someone uncivil? Lima (Peru's capital) even higher 10k per million Well according people overheard talking yesterday, it’s there’s nothing worry 36 healthy 🤦‍♀️ keep mind unvaccinated populations breeding grounds variants, variants means opportunity make vaccinations less effective. much tempting say ""well want get vaccinated, that's them"", could come back bite vaccinated someday.

Not there's much it... Hilarious. number new infections number hundreds deaths single digits. Proof positive vaccine works. story people realize low vaccine acceptance states. makes 'ittle difference indoor spaces maskless full capacity. Even here, somewhat progressive Austin, coffee shops packed maskless crowds working laptops. dozen people, sitting next other, eating, drinking, working less 200 sq ft. old? many days final shot? doing?? infections alone. asymptomatic spread closer 90%, similar previous data. Nobody ever is, including home, think people Miami building.

Just aware realities think wise aware vaccination lead invulnerability vaccinated people consider uninfectable. sake safety still vectors demands putting othes danger.

We live societies duties well behaviour affects safety. kind vaccine tech reserch decades. Besides body destroys vaccines within days administered resulting body knowing react next time round.

Trialing accelerated comparison vaccines 10s thousands volunteers instead less couple hundred. masks shown make people shop less, economy going big topic midterm elections.

Nobody government cares lives. It’s economic indicators.   kind vaccine tech reserch decades. Besides body destroys vaccines within days administered resulting body knowing react next time round.

Trialing accelerated comparison vaccines 10s thousands volunteers instead less couple hundred. still wrong approach though. kind acknowledge fears. Calling idiots make double humans would. mean round 4... Send link statistics textbook ""Let's re-open places young people chance fully vaccinate, flock to! blow faces, it?""

Russian isn’t unknown we’ve war Russia last 5 decades. US forgot it, Russia didn’t. entire thing poorly thought disaster, basically.

This sums West's entire pandemic response two doses? That’s amazing.  headline lies. link. 

""The possibility laboratory accident cannot entirely dismissed"" nothing political post hoping get removed. day ~1 year ago FL reported upwards 15k cases. keeps pulling data retroactively changing qualifies count changing numbers might hard find (I posted social media could look back posts), day 15,000 positive tests never forget that. really hope get back there, especially Delta, Delta+, Gamma, maybe Lambda? Shut downs even necessary vax mask. must weird, find onerous put mask go grocery store. Flu shots worse efficacy…. point nonsense.

Doubling time cases Netherlands looks like 2 days right now. stays anywhere near level long going really bad situation. 

Already higher per capita UK think?

Also seems lagging UK peoplr fully vaccinated 10% population, presumably significantly people vulnerable. I'm personally similar camp far double vaxxed optimistic live area hit close 70% first dose pretty quickly continues go people see family friends dying shot.

It extreme concerned bunch unvaccinated people low prevention state newest, rapidly spreading variant spiking. I'm saying sky falling herd immunity actually thing. see polio outbreaks see measles outbreaks decades yet outbreak centered around Disney California 2014 due growing antivax sentiment (almost 40% unvaccinated infected kids adults due personal/family beliefs medical necessity avoid vaccine). Many hospitalized. see measles outbreaks yet, did. yes optimistic returning normalish life many areas trust people regard essential oils mass marketing replacement medical education make good decisions. bad decisions affect others.  15% previous chance get sick.

What might factor several hundred thousand (mostly young) people allowed get vaccine 28 days passed since positive test, quite self-isolating top that. neutral far government models go. Interesting data, though read multiple non school masking studies showing effectiveness. study linked also found effective adults.

Kids must low viral spreaders something else work here. CDC press yesterday also recommended unvaxed kids still mask.  Glad California keeping masks k-12 schools statewide explain selective pressure would prevent deadlier variant emerging. basic evolutionary standpoint, long presymptomatic contagious period basically eliminates selective pressure variant. long people dying infect people, spread.

 


I suggest actually talk epidemiologist instead pretending have. vaccine ever long term scary side effects.

Let introduce GSK H1N1 Pandemrix swine flu vaccine 2009. Roughly 0.009% vaccinated Swedes shortly developed Narcolepsy, young (440 cases 5m vaccinated).

However, case mentioned offending virus H1N1/pdm09 low mortality rate \~0.03% compared COVID19s \~0.5-1.0%. think people know it? concern media overexxagerate it?

Not trying condescending, likely I'm fed extremes echo chambers sides. Whether anti maskers, anti vaxxers, opposite end spectrum see unstoppable doomsday virus vaccines made progress on. Exasperated ends it. 

I'm personally happy double vaxxed cautiously optimistic we're new stage.  right makes mad right now. unwillingness right country humanity whole going allow mutation occur kill millions even vaccines. dumbing society lead inevitably extinction walking towards smiling. good interview time watch it. think reasonable conclusion, basically agrees previous interviews watched Karan Thapar subject actual Covid-19 death toll India:

- [I Believe One Million Indians Already Died COVID, Says Mathematician Murad [A Million Indians Likely Died End Second Covid Wave, Says Pandemic official death toll cannot correct, must much higher. soon heard “honor system” heart sunk I’m nurse.

Yes, sure! back there! open secret. every one knows ppl died. month two, hospital beds, extreme shortage oxygen. even space crematoriums burial grounds. completely control.

Yeah sure Antibodies going primary line defense future infections. unusual decline time. major parts immune system swing action, t-cells others.

It's irresponsible media focus antibodies even mention other, robust responses immune system provides. fear mongering. 95% effective, 20 unvaccinated people would gotten it, instead 1 will. 90% effective, 10:1. 75% effective (J&amp;J?), 4:1. 

 
What means spread virus among unvaccinated, vaccinated people still get it. Cases rising lot places, bad everyone, including vaccinated.  No, everyone else US could one now, one 12 get vaccinated. I’m tired people basically saying “throw unvaccinated wolves” kids can’t protected  light reading vaccinations introduced.  Throughout medical world it’s common natural immunity stronger inoculation . It’s absolute

That's different statement ""natural immunity always better immunity inoculations"".

I questioned ""common"". Send colony Ironically said comment chain fearmongering 95% effective, 20 unvaccinated people would gotten it, instead 1 will. 90% effective, 10:1. 75% effective (J&amp;J?), 4:1. 

What means spread virus among unvaccinated, vaccinated people still get it. Cases rising lot places, bad everyone. that's still 86% effectiveness prevent death actually.. around 75-80% adult vaccinated..
 
edit: pfizer's effectiveness prevent death Chile 91% sitting -22 downvotes. think time reevaluate ideas maybe seek professional help! Excess deaths tricky too, long pandemic going effects restrictions deaths causes. UK example:

- 128,000 deaths person died cause within 28 days testing positive virus
- 152,000 deaths doctor specifically determined died virus (even without positive test)
- 113,000 excess deaths since beginning pandemic 

Going excess deaths right UK right would underestimate close 40,000 comparison accurate recording method. Although countries tested poorly it'll probably still best measure. case counts zero. then, it’s still threat. Taipei, July 10 (CNA) Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) Saturday reported 33 new cases COVID-19, including 31 domestic infections north country, said recent infection clusters Taipei Pingtung brought control.

At press briefing, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) said number new cases linked clusters wholesale markets Taipei City dropped considerably since CECC set special command center area July 2.

He referring 200-plus cases recently confirmed First Fruit &amp; Vegetable Wholesale Market, Second Fruit &amp; Vegetable Wholesale Market, Huannan Market, located city's Wanhua Zhongshan districts.

From July 1-3, CECC Taipei City government tested 11,159 people three markets, 51 them, 0.44 percent, positive, Chen said.

During testing July 8 9, four new cases found among 4,671 people tested, indicated positivity rate 0.08 percent, said.

""Given improvement situation, CECC decided close special command center area Saturday, testing continue markets next week,"" Chen said.


Meanwhile, number cases Delta variant cluster Pingtung remained 17 Saturday, despite widespread testing, indicated control, according Chen.

Recent tests 3,033 patients staff Fangliao General Hospital, several infections believed occurred, negative, 500 600 contacts identified cluster released quarantine, Chen said.

Meanwhile, 33 new COVID-19 cases confirmed Saturday, 31 domestic infections, northern Taiwan, 19 tested positive quarantine, according CECC.


Taipei New Taipei cities reported 13 cases, followed Taoyuan four cases Keelung one, CECC said.

But also person initially responded pointed ""you told"" even finally deleted Twitter months ago I’m glad did. could break away Reddit I’d completely social media free. Unfortunately, unvaccinated incubators variants. also mean it’s less deadly? think person asking higher viral load means severe case average. family Massachusetts/Boston area, there. Two things favor northeast, imho: 
1) getting hit hard beginning pandemic made people aware serious covid is, 2) good school systems people actually learn science. 

I'm sorry anyone suffering hospital right now, they're unvaccinated choice--oh well. Put no-fly list rest lives. deaths matching curves cases like first 2 UK waves. Vaccines obviously work fact frail/vulnerable elderly either dead first waves vaccinated means see way fewer deaths per cases. fear lot ""long covid"" effects. think next ten - twenty years going struggle lot people.

It's race time Australia get us vaccinated.

NSW see explosion cases think matter time leaks rest Australia. feel like messed vaccine delivery badly gonna cost us dearly. insignificant percentage people can’t afford shoes.

Dafuq getting from? Russia tropical country footwear optional. 5 months year need proper winter boots get frostbite outside.  It’s joke. sensationalist fodder antivaxx lunatics. Don’t feel bad.  I'm sorry loss. Looks like Russian bots downvoting us 😂 People continue die reason. Pure stupidity. always multiply 10x safe. It’s probably much higher anymore (though suspect early months), feel closer truth official numbers. know trust vaccine 95%. either 0 100. 

That stupid flaw education. look revising attitude rather expecting science reality conform expectations.

Sorry word stupid strong, is, expect world, physical reality conform think world risk I'll take similar risk getting car.

again, no. huge difference 95% 66&amp; 99.999%. perceive integers 0 1, problem project reality. always multiply 10x safe. It’s probably much higher anymore (though suspect early months), feel closer truth official numbers. No. general public large moved either vaccinated never gave shit first place.

Yeah. Funny thing me. tend take science facts scientists - people Reddit cherry-picking numbers CDC.

I guess people afraid next media big news drive vaccine hesitancy. Oh cool. definitely didn’t hear there, ( trusted cockpit ha) everywhere talk covid precautions. We’re Reddit, it’s easy lie lot people want attention, stupid people like you, prefer believe random internet users scientific research real concern unvaccinated.

Delta contagious, dangerous 12. Children serious illness Delta remain extremely rare. Seems silly. Need data effectiveness efficacy. It’ll kids 12 get vaccinated.  Depends country. England (where article is) need two shots. virus going continue spread anyways, endemic, going able hide wait out. whole notion sort pause eliminate globally went window allowed casually spread around globe months starting back fall 2019.  human population around globe, shown spread among animals pretty easily well.  can't put cat back bag.  

The best thing people get vaccinated, eat right, exercise get lives. ask valid important.  countries that, England not. I’d like see hard numbers. Apparently 3 deaths per day back June.  I’d like see hard numbers. Apparently 3 deaths per day back June.  anyone epidemiology would tell you, mutated variants never fatal,

That's true, [this mutation virus highlights, associated greater lethality: ""Our study indicates new H7N9 mutants lethal chickens""

That paper simply exist correct anyone epidemiology would say. Yeah no, several journalists digging around way testing admittance system set up, allowed ton false negatives enter night clubs people vaccinated. releasing restrictions, Delta rise, less half people vaccinated dumb populist gamble. ! Floridian here, fully vaxxed staying masked. lost trust anything COVID-related put state Rebekah Jones got canned late spring 2020.

A quote read March 2020 last week working office really struck chord (paraphrasing I'm lazy look up): Precautions taken pandemic seem excessive. pandemic, precautions seem inadequate. Well, two locales, one mask mandate one without... I'd rather one mask mandate see effects no-masks delta circulating. 

When say vaccinated people ""fine"", mean relatively; we're still learning breakthrough rate be. 

And unvaxxed start overloading hospitals, someone vaxxed non-covid emergency may able get care. 

So we'll see. UK removing mask mandates, pretty much tell us happens that. confused? brought Florida reason? Illinois never brought up. Clearly dunking ignorant republicans giving ignorant urban population pass wish (U.K.) could go back ‘only’ 3k new cases day, we’re 35k climbing…

I hope Florida doesn’t follow trajectory stay safe. many great memories numerous visits Florida it’s wonderful people. Exactly. mean, could least kept masks social distancing bit longer. no, it’s back normal ‘Freedom Day’ - shops offices ripping Perspex screens etc. Thank god beat eh? *facepalm* many studies publications 30% Covid number without vaccination though, whereas flu number vaccination. compare two would need know post-vaccination Covid long haul rate. suspect nowhere near 30%. sure referring according Wikipedia “Immunization done various techniques, commonly vaccination.” seeing vaccines COVID I’m sure say “there immunization COVID-19”. Anyone epidemiology would tell viruses mutate, may contagious, actually weaken virulence

That hard-and-fast rule. often case, always.

The virus plenty time spread killing host. Also, majority cases, doesn’t kill host. two factors play, little selective pressure favor less-lethal strains virus.

The reason sometimes given respiratory viruses become less lethal become contagious part respiratory system reproduce best in. Something favors lungs expected dangerous less transmissible something favors upper respiratory system. idea much evidence actually happening/shaping viral evolution general, even thing, probably won’t apply here. SARS-CoV-2 grow well lungs *and* highly transmissible, there’s probably much selective pressure get lungs become upper-respiratory-only.    question quickly get population immunity, 95% not, population 70% vaccinated? rate infection slowing I'd imagine may take long time get full number.  don’t believe science general.

They don’t think climate change real.
They don’t think, even year COVID pandemic real see need vaccinated sort thing.
Plus religious bigots.

So thanking finding solution 3 problems time despite beliefs makes faces drop trying process that. Well barring citizens entering Belgium, would stopping entering Belgium via air want produce negative test. could theoretically use private transportation (driving car) want prove negative Covid test. least way positive risking others. 

You enter Belgium citizen Covid positive right risk others convenience travel. the.... surprise even suburb hear people partying night, pretty terrible. Britain think going unannounced herd immunity programme. risk groups vaccinated, going let rip. Probably trying get school kids infected summer holidays. mass outbreak easier child vaccination policy. Japan densely populated, masks work 100% Side note: adult chicken pox taken chicken pox vaccine, smart move. unnecessary chicken pox vaccine prior infection, shingles vaccine thing. Reinfection chicken pox also super rare, occur blue moon. Chicken pox situation covid.

As adult caught chicken pox, doctor stressed what's mild disease children much worse me. Even non fatal case lasting effects, making permanently sterile. vaccine low community spread, however, makes much less risk encounter unvaccinated person previously infected. also required college either vaccinated prove prior infection, actually thing already places. Again, situation covid. correlation diseases caused viruses, even viruses behave differently.

Recent covid studies also suggested good go. Delta particular showing antibody evasion, recent study showing prior infection may drastically reduced protection year. Seriously, legit study posted today it. science covid constantly changing new situation decades covid research draw upon. Nothing set stone here. Oh no.

Wow😑😑😑 idea disease supposed win instead?

I see forever 'lockdown.' surge nearly 10,000 infections day Florida.

If state decides count visitors going help tourism? someone comes gets sick ""it count?"" #***DO ANYWAY*** Basically, rules dropped soon. 

This I'm ignoring CDC's dropping mandates continue masking whenever go anyway. Numbers starting go area lot businesses dropped mask requirement. could figure why... deny COVID? solution this? Spain Portugal right now, respectively, 16th 17th vaccinated countries world (by first dose excluding countries 1 million inhabitants). 

Looking vaccine uptake statistics per age group now, think good chance weeks 1st 2nd (not sure two first). also think might first countries vaccinate 80% total (yes, adult eligible) population.

This ranking Never though needed consider natural immunity vs getting vaccine. Unfortunately can't consider fully safe there's always small risk could still get virus- they're called breakthrough cases. country we've cases people dying delta variant even though fully vaccinated. rare, still happen. 

Please protect others, especially around crowds. Even legally wear mask social distance, consider anyway case. supposed feel it? numbers say. worst period COVID Florida January. 

Yes. disputed that's time new infection rate reached near 10,000 per day.

I sure getting ""near 10,000 per day"" from. highest 7-day average cases Florida reached \~18,000 January began 7-day average never came 10,000 Feb -through June.

Yes, neither July. current 7-day average stands 3,392, near 7-day average 10,000. talking newest rates spiked alternate days. 7 day average wait another 6 13 days...

Okay, we'll see. raise cases spike April went 9,000 one day, 7-day average decreased. 

Again, amount people vaccinated, vaccines protecting Delta variant well (as cited previous reply). think wrong say Florida going back one worst periods. January, number people vaccinated near today. Glad learned something   Yeah screw guys right? feel?  first dose pfizer still effective 3 weeks. 

Multiple studies shown increase infection right first shot Pfizer. infection drops next couple weeks.

The issue “people waited three weeks got infected anyways”. issue “people zero waiting acted like they’re fully vaccinated day first shot”. there’s increase infection rate people got first shot. numbers probably low since know Florida heavily doctored numbers last year. Yeah, may run limits soon. fair, believe true number infections already quite bit higher official number. Wherever go hear people sniffling, sneezing, coughing, coincidentally telltale symptoms mild Delta-infection. Since looks similar case sniffles, think substantial number infected people get tested think that's - sniffles. agree. choice made. also part trial back august placebo. Guess live life edge lol seem recall Delta cause deaths need mechanical ventilation might outdated.

You recall stupid reporting / causation. 

People act like worse look countries vacinated. 

Delta deadly.  said too. try suggesting everything clearly people listening hope people get vaccinated least put masks back avoid crowded seen entire takeover Delta variant transmission,” Dr. Thomas Dobbs, state health officer, said Friday afternoon. state asking that: 
All residents 65 years age avoid indoor mass gatherings (regardless vaccination status). 
All residents chronic underlying medical conditions avoid indoor mass gatherings. 
All unvaccinated residents wear mask indoors public settings. 
**All residents 12 years age older receive Covid-19 vaccination.** 
In addition asking people get vaccinated soon possible wear mask public do, state asking vulnerable people take extra precautions, Dr. Dobbs said. Fucking twats get vaccinated. checked recently, remember hearing Delta might twice likely hospitalize. 

However, even translates deaths, vaccines effective stopping cases deaths, we'd still expect see drop case fatality rate moving forward. 
If cases grow larger exponent young elderly, there's really possibility case fatality rate high used to. Young people really really rarely die, compared frequently old people die. like 0.00005 odds. Ya good. Good job getting poked less half flu deaths kids year...and 1/5 number kids die car accidents Play fire, burn human race plague. standard wet market… think expected this. still think escaped lab, however.   Also seems like makes Delta deadly. breakthrough infection happens individual level someone vaccinated gets infected. population level think binary thing. decreased efficacy may warrant updated booster. health agencies decide that's needed. Weekend numbers always delayed caught tuesday big one think.   many people go doctor follow shot? numbers WILDLY underreported. Ohan. Lakota winyan waun.  Thanks. you! friendly suggestion: learn differentiates friendly dick.

Good. fact pointing Scott Gottlieb kind indicated fighting medical advice. cannot answer questions regarding people say COVID-19 hoax.

I asked ""What point part stands really stupid lot places basically fumbling finish line real reason. They're dropping restrictions *while vaccination campaigns still mid-flight.* Plenty places reopening criteria like ""50% eligible adults 1 dose"" whatnot.

It seems wiser thing would make major push reopen like 70-80% fully vaccinated, lot countries couple months away. people psychologically invested *this* summer ""the back normal summer"" want tolerate another month two restrictions vaccination rates ramped high go. leads situations like this. think won’t get fined go insane finally consequences entitled actions lives im vaccine yet news like means vaccine still ""tested"" , conspiracist antivaxer? Oh sarcastic? Got second dose yesterday mild heart inflammation disturbed sleep. Currently, it’s less intense yesterday. relax let pass? Yeah real clincher tbh, though underestimate amount people getting long covid now. actually surprised high numbers today didn’t cause troubles systems, seemed happen every time record cases. Tomorrow could well bring new alltime record new cases NL…  I'm this. reasonable ask young people pause lives period, order prioritize vaccinating elderly, vulnerable etc., vaccination roll-outs mishandled vaccine hesitancy dragging things out, always going reach point enough would enough patience goodwill would wear thin. hygienic want. still mercy people around you, however.

Health public. people subconsciously tend adopt controversial opinions boost ego. Looking behavior good observable indicator something's rotten person's underlying personality. Concluding Paragraph:

Our findings provide early evidence regarding use FMT recurrent CDI patients COVID-19. Furthermore, data let us speculate gut microbiome manipulation may merit exploration immunomodulatory strategy COVID-19. Based experience (and data demonstrating gut microbiome-immune interactions humans10), progressing clinical trial assess impact FMT added standard COVID-19 treatment risk reduction disease progression (NCT04824222); commence recruitment shortly. Florida reports Fridays. 10k number total new cases previous 7 days Europe shutting again, US going follow. Im talking later, 90% vaccinated deaths vaccinated higher vs non vaccinated.

for example: 2 deaths 90k vaccinated vs 1 death 10k.

Just check Israel results weeks like that.

That's basic, normal maths. minimal nuisance best. course given choice pandemic going on, also would wear it. 
Alas, thats case. 
People outright refuse wear masks ‘strongly recommended’ scientific community order save lives significant volumes stupid, egocentric, both.

Government setting policy intrest people still stupidly fight it. 

If gamma theta whatever-variant originates somewhere western world, defeating vaccines, thats likely mask refusers governments buckle/give pressure coming them. Covidiots. 

I hope ends year. (Knocks wood) It’s people need realize! enough talk it! doesn’t mean die even get hospitalized people 100% till get virus vaccinated WAY better chance fighting doesn’t replicate enough anything still get even spread it. already soldiers door kinda thing always stop attack either aka “breakthrough” cases. doesn’t mean scared don’t stupid act like virus doesn’t exist like lot now.... doctors still don’t know exactly many antibodies constitute great protection completely causes “long Covid” still figuring act like virus doesn’t exist anymore everyone talk vaccines like makes immune false reality lead lots problems act like reality actual reality is.

Vaccines great! tool concrete condom body blocks anything coming space. feel sick even vaccinated, know could Covid, it’s impossible needs wider known information truth matter even doesn’t mean need change things do, understanding key. oldest moved Vermont love it. Unfortunately another college. Hopefully torture us moving Missouri. I'm already checking job scene VT. *secretly*  Honest question, 70%+ population vaccinated make difference? odds, (and could wrong), seem lot better peak COVID last year, variant not. Well shit Hardly arbitrary. They're intended protect people. everyone elected. Many people appointed elected. 

Besides, elected leaders make arbitrary rules there. example, trusting school boards make public health decisions pandemic insane. School boards basically elected business leaders unqualified responsibility. Give unelected public health experts day. Lunacy sanity, conformity individuality, oppression liberation. Welcome 21st century, weak men create hard times. Got first vaccine Pfizer, second dose Moderna. mild fever recovered 1.5 days. Lucky? partner live north east (NYC) experience pandemic, think we'll ever move away part country. perfect I've liked north east people handled pandemic. No, young people think want coddled told - least, that's keep telling world. There's excuse 18 months pandemic feign ignorance absolute basics respiratory virus outbreak. None all. Lacking critical thinking skills, indifference, gone rough time (like rest population) may reason irresponsible behavior, excuse. 
 
They much responsible current out-of-control dumpster fire bars clubs screwed pooch letting people unchecked, back door, etc., course worthless fuckmuppets Hague. cases come clubs local events. One pub like 180 cases single night. Flawed method showing negative test &lt;48h ago enough enter club(without distancing) could frauded fairly easy. Well quite logical. nobody direct circle people gets adversely affected it, really thinking: let's get vaccinated.. odds either.. wonder masking transportation axed? That's one thing holding back making trips places like NY Florida. feel ready either two things mask mandate transportation gone. fear never will.  Give one example data. Real data. bad vaccine availability information marred commercial geopolitical issues different countries corporations. ideal world, vaccines would available choose depending particular case. data countries massively used several vaccines. Mexico Chile come mind. Look up. Thats known toll. excess death toll 10 million   variants pop idiots refuse get vaccine  exactly, future (few months) deaths vaccinated vs unvaccinated, thats normal, basic maths. Ofc happen (like Israel) cause vaccinated people vs unvaccinated, shouldnt surprise anyone make news 5 percent fully vaccinated ever r/SpringfieldMO, make sure use Cox. Mercy mismanaged train wreck that's last leg.

Not saying Parsons' blaming shortage ventilators valid though. He's handled pandemic poorly entire time, trying shift blame. AZ main 3 available country, AZ already banned 40s this. also much less terrifying believe someone created nature crippled civilization without even noticing could anytime. don’t feel like tracking link - it’s UK based app tracks Covid symptoms - think called Zoe. Since UK experiencing surge delta cases much longer wait vaccine shots see impact partially vaccinated symptoms. 

I’d argue back data want emerging within dashboards countries like Israel UK. It’s published yet. 

What wrote pcr testing supposition, google people test positive Covid weeks disease read test picking RNA fragments. believe paper South Korea it. Lower population density probably helps. Bill Burr best commentary on, think, last Conan appearance. Basically, think they're going kill everyone got vaccine? people would left assholes cooperate anything anyone says. That's nightmare. anything going come COVID-2 kill people get vaccine people they're told left. rebuttal. Elon musk incredibly smart. wondering would suggest deaths reported.  question considered exceeding normal. say (I'm making numbers example sake) disease kills 50k people year. kills 49800 one year say seemed killing less people wed say that's within error noise whatever. that's .4% difference. 117 million vaccines 283 cases incredibly small number. probably higher normal difference 100 people scale 100+ million population seems something hard account for? What's sensitivity noise will. I'm medical doctor I'm engineer. could measure voltage across component jump around add enough zeros that's noise system, randomness, component I'm measuring causing extra fluctuation. Low cost airlines brings low lives. UK deaths risen much all. delta variant awhile.  concerned covid though viruses lead long covid chronic symptoms health issues, brain damage, etc. would rather wait research done, treatments place figure prevent post covid health problems.

Nobody sit home. really simple, basic precautions like masks indoor places take minimal 0 effort helpful. know numbers extremely made up, wanted show scenario without vaccination  UK deaths risen much all. delta variant awhile. experiences universal lol WHAT? According Elon Musk rebuttal? aren’t vaccinated also waiting get covid would nervous that. Vaccine largely safe, vastly safer covid get great relief.  aren’t vaccinated also waiting get covid would nervous that. Vaccine largely safe, vastly safer covid get great relief. humanity focused trying convince people get vaccine, discouraging elevating anecdotal tear-jerk local news interest pieces. J&amp;J known issue rare blood clotting problem small number women child-bearing age. reports scary first happened, medical community knows handle 

I believe bit misconception. clotting thought overwhelmingly occurring women, last read, original thought due fact early on, young people getting vaccinated *were* women, likely nurses. think rate VIITP men women, could wrong. Woah. “Fatigue” “Brain fog”

Didn’t know caught long Covid 15 years ago  came back 5 day trip Netherlands first thing came back get tested. People acting like pandemic over. made mistake visit theme park rule still place (keep 1.5m distance) completely ignored people. 

We wore masks time, people (mostly tourists guess) did.

So came back heard development, surprised all.  There's conspiracy. perfectly reasonable possibility COVID originated lab. mean, ground zero COVID right beside Wuhan Institute Virology, known studying coronaviruses.

The truth is, China would never admit thing, they'll never allow outsiders conduct investigation. find definitive proof COVID originated natural environment, lab escape theory always remain possibility. majority people truly vulnerable (ie, yo) mostly vaccinated generally unlinked. 

If disease spreading amongst young generally won’t severe disease case counts high burden healthcare minimal. 

At point, everyone wants vaccine get one feel less concerned morally. 

Lastly, vaccine wildly effective death even vulnerable. Fully vaccinated people dying rate around 1 per million. see nobody talking antibody dependent enhancement. Lots people bumping subreddits listening Pied Piper articles already coming reversing mask mandate poor choice. think vaccinated spreading delta ADE allows virus camouflage instances “hotwiring” antibodies, similar another process vaccine, potentially increasing infectiousness people exposed PEG-40 lipid/mRNA. concerning scary we’re seeing level vaccine adoption rate since means way forward, booster time!! get additional plastic laden booster! nah imma start vaccine company, fuck Pfizer, could using hemp nanoparticles screw everybody okay petroleum vaccines.

Source:
Nursing family, NCBI articles, health nut, fond bolstering T-lymphocytes ACV, passionate critic official government statements reading lines. also moron Ultimately think would've come hospitalization rate, that's caused places implement restrictions - avoid overwhelming healthcare system hospitals.

In scenario depends less severe around less lethal still bad enough land lots people hospital. former scenario, probably lockdowns. latter one, probably would been. That’s kinda amusing yet people rushing back stuff like that. mean missed working crowded cafe? Why? LoL

we can’t fix stupid. California I’m seeing adults wear masks public initially reopened last month. It’s like maybe 40% now. Initially nobody. Smart people know what’s up. still inaccurate say mRNA vaccines 95% effective covid. 

First all, data Delta variant shows slightly lower efficacy 93%. 

But importantly, confuses people think 93% protected that's true. Even someone hospitalized, still get sick. still develop long covid post covid chronic symptoms. still spread others.   post removed cannot verify reliable source.

Because=money Why? it’s hospitalizing killing people anywhere near rates past… mention many new cases partially fully vaccinated... cause longer term initial weeks days??  Still data countries outside Israel show \~88% efficacy symptomatic covid Delta variant even less asymptomatic infection. mRNA vaccines; less efficacy J&amp;J. 

Also, data Israel might show lower efficacy because:

1) started vaccinating earlier UK - could mean decreasing immunity time

2) spread doses 3 weeks; countries time doses higher. could something it

3) Israel fully opened up. countries took time barely opened schools, still people wearing masks, recently reopened. Israel testing vaccines slightly different, restriction free environment. 

It still makes sense consider data various sources, discount data Israel numbers seem low. flight Florida, family pissed plane taking couple minutes extra take off.

[Covid-19 vaccine efficacy common misunderstanding 95% efficacy means Pfizer clinical trial, 5% vaccinated people got COVID. that's true; actual percentage vaccinated people Pfizer (and Moderna) trials got COVID-19 hundred times less that: 0.04%. 95% actually means vaccinated people 95% lower risk getting COVID-19 compared control group participants, vaccinated. words, vaccinated people Pfizer clinical trial 20 times less likely control group get COVID-19. makes vaccine ""one effective vaccines have,"" Barker told Live Science. comparison, two-dose measles, mumps rubella (MMR) vaccine 97% effective measles 88% effective mumps, according Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC). seasonal flu vaccine 40% 60% effective (it varies year year, depending year's vaccine flu strains), still prevented estimated 7.5 million cases flu U.S. 2019-2020 flu season, according CDC.

Vaccinated back normal life.

If you’re vaccinated that’s fault. stay home away people, kids can’t get vaccinated yet. Zero reason bring grocery store elsewhere inside.    fun 🐑 data several states last months suggest 99.5% deaths COVID-19 United States unvaccinated people,"" Walensky said. higher rate Israeli study 67ppl 12 million. almost 6 cases every million. higher rate Astrazenecas side effects, 1 million. ones raising alarm Phizer/BioNTech though. 🤔 chances variant able seriously endanger vaccinated individuals incredibly low. even happen mRNA tech formulate appropriate vaccine like 2 weeks don’t think that’s true, Delta hasn’t affected Ontario significant way yet. Good you.  country we've lost ability agree disagree. Cutting people disagree divides country. 

I'm boat. I'm vaccinated, brother law basis rushed.  difficult sometimes continue conversation.  Timing tone everything. Got know bring drop it.  never go delusion I'm going change mind, want hear different point view occasionally.  idiots I'm concerned about, fact wipe thing continue adapt spread, leading increasingly ineffective vaccines death.  Well that's approach they're making countries. thinking least could require masks indoors. That's like bare minimum good bare minimum preventing spread Twitter, honestly, isn’t representative. think it’ll take lot worse we’re going get people comply lockdown again. cases suddenly collapse India start May? know went lockdown Delta variant contagious everyone says really make sense two months later cases still dropping one saying all. make idea from? It’s really disingenuous spread false ideas like made-up comment. Yeah we're hurdling toward extinction, think great TV!  paranoids begun froth yet? hell link article. Jesus. phone got myocarditis trying open ""article"". Think could put ads there?   98.7% number article. Early question someone really wanted go gym, rephrased really want go gym work out. ongoing outbreak deadly viral pneumonia public health guidance avoid indoor spaces people breathing respiratory droplets. Would okay go enclosed space lot people engaged aerobic exercise involving heavy breathing engage activities? No.  virus nothing like room full people shooting other.

Deaths happen later.

From: Google search: [florida covid  Although don’t agree decision; comparing apples oranges. People often intelligent successful one area foolish low intelligence another. would given monoclonal antibodies IV hospitalized treatment. pressure economic lobbyists. FWIW, fact dominant actually good, means current extent transmissibility get much higher. Living highly vaccinated Northeast seen rise yet, I'm hoping really curbed transmission enough. know sub knows this, current variants already affects mental state. mention strokes covid cause, that’s people survive kids I'm concerned about, hope find vaccine suitable children, parents refuse kids behalf. That's fair reason think would increase protection people who’s immunity waned first two doses (that’s pretty much everybody).

Pfizer stated seeing data showing protection wane 6 months, though. Wearing kevlar drastically reduces chances dying bullet hit.

What's point? perspective, efficacy rates compared one another performed time, place, variant. mRNA vaccines tested around time Alpha variant. generally efficacy rate. vaccines tested different time different variants taking place. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, vaccines provide stronger immune response natural infection generally within order magnitude terms ongoing efficacy rates. May wrong? Yes. reasoning generally sound point. Repeating lie five times doesn’t make true. hate kind argument way prove either side. 

Other actual data regarding covid cases deaths per capita. know little mitigate spread?

Comparing states less restrictive. Using neutralizing assays determine immunity questionable best, looks one part immune response (IgG serum neutralization), vitro, makes lot assumptions

Amen! best time. Reinfections rare, address later comment. Real world data going far valuable opinion, luckily lot research reinfection:

Totally, disagree links provided section quoted?

Edit:

I think may effect immune escape mutations vaccine efficacy. would interesting investigate further, however I'd like highlight awesome vaccines relative infection. suggestion reword section, I'd love read it! Delta variant contagious better able evade vaccines, MIGHT (I said ""might"", btw) need enact measures times. 

That would breakthrough cases even older variants mean scenario Delta variants cause us take measures. Yeah, think learned lot last 15 months, whether like not. 

One thing learned takes 2-3 months reasonably-contagious virus spread globally initial hotspot. advent ubiquitous air travel really changed game. ships people got around, transit time usually long enough passengers either die beat back disease reaching destination. vast numbers people (and do) travel anywhere world even know sick. traditional barriers global infection mostly gone.

At time, seem developed effective countermeasures this, willingness use them. People want vacations trips matter what.

Another thing learned still takes years develop, manufacture, distribute vaccine global population. reliance vaccines, helpful important, going total solution anything. ""the vax doesnt work everyone gets suddenly start working!""   younger person (24) still following rules. multiple causes jump, think important one group people collectively decided corona exist anymore. 1.5 metre joke, nobody wearing masks anymore. quite ashamed age group, act like never partied before. clubs follow 1.5 metre rule, long vaccinated negative test. realising vaccinated still get covid, system testing major flaws therefore negative results screenshotted shared people. even heard people coron want miss al parties still intentionally went club. Selfish people. knew going happen, got much freedom once. Sucks ruin Netherlands probably go stage red next week age group cant go holiday anymore us fully vaccinated yet. charged bioterrorism. Knowingly exposing countless innocents infectious disease classify. Send message. Right ! whether end second date that’s one less unvaccinated person walking about. think saw lot mask4all sub come think it.

For information Covid-19 vaccines, read article-
[Covid-19 vaccines seemed vaccine situation basically changed 90 days there. vaccinated person work guy travelled US division gotten vaccinated there.

Which completely false, busy vaccinating high risk groups, obviously colleagues younger vaccinated yet. addition vaccine delivery really started kick May/June. hospitals slowly steadily getting empty that's restrictions lifted. Obviously last couple decisions regards clubs festivals moronic Thin heard. don’t want vaccine, let get sick, watch elders suffer pain die. Maybe they’ll learn.  Vermont close achieving herd immunity! upvoted you. read linked still doesn’t seem really go saying. say still get infected, don’t mean breakthrough. mean people seem believe virus can’t enter system. far understand it, virus absolutely still enter system. It’s like somehow blocks nose mouth virus entry. 

It’s still telling immune system respond. Breakthrough cases understand vaccine gets foothold generally shows tests. still negative virus system, even extremely low levels immune system started fighting it. 

So example, go Costco unmasked vaccinated. Someone COVID unvaccinated coughs basically right you, inhale thousands Covid particles/virus. vaccine nothing stop that, Covid system. least define infected, infected. Maybe clinical definition different that’s confusion arise apologize. point least sense, infected. immune system sees kills it, hopefully breakthrough really point. 

Hopefully makes point tried make clearer. I’m wrong someone Covid literally coughing face would somehow allow virus enter body all, would extremely surprising me. true. think many people fully grasp gravity long covid. 1/3 infected covid likely deal it, symptoms truly disabling. autoimmune condition many symptoms -- made unable work full-time essentially left homebound entire year found treatment plan alleviated symptoms. long covid, known cure, significant portion population disabled suffering indefinitely, may never fully recover. social, economic, political implications truly astounding, part ""post-covid"" conversation. official reports stating lethal new variant   cope Additionally - due Desantis - university student another state country tested positive, made sure number didn’t report Florida’s reporting case wasn’t “Florida resident.” Heard shit time here. Putin ALWAYS better tactician strategist. Crimea perfect example that, others exist.

His leadership story total tactical victory strategic defeat, near fatal. successful far, recovering strategic defeats meaningful way. Another round sanctions targeted oligarchs might see end example, nearly last time.

I feel Russian people, deserve much better. rich western nation, reason besides political systems live centuries corrupt leaders. guess US lucky without major spread. ask really good question. I’ve wondering lately well. Everyone know talking 12 vaccine like it’s foregone conclusion don’t think is. think there’s decent chance approved emergency use younger children’s risk lower 12+ cohort. personally letting 8 year old live normally summer community spread currently low 70% vaccinated area, friends family vaccinated. He’s also likely fine. understand parents may make different risk assessment.  opened EVERYTHING way soon. 
Amazingly hard stay safe shitty ass government. anyone link studies talking about? think heard number around 40-60 normally. jump 300ish quite large relatively speaking, speaks causality, still minor risk overall. made really good point, result I’ll continue believe vaccine hesitancy anti vax people complete morons. topic cases

While cases reached nearly 10,000 past couple days mentioned, 7-day average (~3,300/day) nowhere near peak (~15,000/day) January.

Would agree this? No, that's arrhythmia, likely related inflammation. caused vaccine, body triggering immune response, turn body reacts sending ""fight"" hormones (increased heart rate side effect)

Arrhythmias rarely anything concerned about, especially something short lived. Almost every person gets time time, everyone feels them. Look vagal manoeuvres feeling like going pass them, could help People acting like pandemic over. Says guy travelled another country completely agree can’t vaccinate 10 year old yet. think people sub actually do. two three fields system describes exactly fallow field

That time frame chose (17th century) claims like ""herbalism understood Europe, practiced many"" BS. Damn, 93% areas less 40% vax rates. Showing level herd immunity occurs vax rates low 45 50%.

Thats great news northeast. ""not 100% safe"" become ""doesn't work?"". Nothing earth 100% safe. something believe trolling? card already played. Move along. 2022's elections happening regardless. good old cold/flu probably hit us vengeance year. 1.5 million cases myocarditis 2013 per Wikipedia. 0.02% getting anyway plus additional 0.0001% vaccine.   Lol ok, let's go Define sky high, what's current case rate per 100,000?  here, it’s fun games happens someone know… last year many people know affected COVID implications pandemic… unusual something people “think” cold.  Well sayign JJ AZ vaccines 30-40% effective Delta variant I'm US, actually live Iraq, our's MOH give much details amount time recovering COVID getting Vaccinated.

and I've recovered 2 months ago.  mean, hard shrug point. understand variants continue else except mandate vaccines approved? point I'm it.  Preventing spread protect vulnerable too.  Correct. 

People seem think antibodies matter all. matter. labs giving false negatives seem concerning. know happens sometimes, it’s scale that’s negligent   mask means get higher initial viral exposure leading higher initial viral load potentially severe case. said handle thinking something either zero 100 percent chance, 95% something mentally handle.

Your thinking flawed, admitted it, tried pretend haven't. Come think it, feel heartburn-like sensations post-vaccine. suprise case. Still glad got vaccinated though. people get cold, cares? vaccine remains highly effective preventing hospitalization death, even symptomatic infection.

1% pretty dam good vacinated folks. agree wouldn’t want side effects anywhere near competition, especially American athletes plenty time get vaccinated Fuck yeah, represent FLORIDAAAA!!! Looks like may getting unemployment back soon thanks fellow Floridians 😎😎 yet hospitalizations deaths dont rise. 

The death rate lags infection rate several months. comments million “delta variant” threads Also, I'd curious see percentages would look like peri/myocarditis got COVID-19. husband couple months got COVID-19 last year, he's never issue before. much published larger, common complications though, happened. young healthy, actually taking risk getting it. Also mathematical fact

That's actually false. numbers show, regardless age health, less likely incur heart inflammation myocarditis would die COVID.

I believe something like 3 4 times likely die COVID side effects occur noting also long-term data makes statement immovable fact.

Sure right now, based data currently have, fact. That's many tones.  article

""Despite positive test, managed get plane using loophole system: Belgians returning red zone present Passenger Locator Form (PLF) upon arrival.

Seems like one big loophole. sounds like (overweight) directors company board meeting, shouting other.

A little sorry body shaming there. exact variant affected lot people vaccinated albeit symptoms mild compared unvaccinated still affected people. Anyways prevention always better damage control India learnt hard way way, truth always comes out. Cheating cover bad policy long. state pretty obvious democrats got vaccine. Sitting 48% last looked, Iowa. understanding primary cause death overdose NSAIDs, slow extremely painful, kidney liver failure, internal bleeding. Controlled painkillers different story. I'm talking risks regular routine use NSAIDs.  Ty Exactly. someone U.S. Russia, kind outcry something hard sympathize free feel way want. change mind handful podcasts online easy find. get acid reflux (like bad heartburn/indigestion) feels like that. Much worse lie down. might something like that, get checked sure. course, that’s covid shots, I’m going mask rare chance get covid atm rare mRNA vaccinated ppl, get covid, it’s rare become severe.  continuing evolution virus give new variants “is clearly inconsistent notion purposely manipulated virus optimised growth human cells”

I wonder people keep ignoring simple obvious fact. Medical students dumb source im 4º year medicine, many colegues dumb enough hard college money don’t want study all, privileged people big egos, vote stupid people took many rights brasil… 

I dont want date people medicine advise many dont hahaha 

1º vacines natural damn body creating immunity artificial stimulus 
2º bf body Gtfo thats toxic 
3º friend still her? Sounds like amazing person 🙃 friend maybe simpatize lots thoughts careful Im native English speaking country. great contribution conversation. real champ Obviously lot people take painkillers trying kill though...  don’t see problem?

This question? 

""The problem"" nearly 10,000 cases past days:July 7 9 higher (worse than) new cases days May 2020 new cases Apriil 2020 even new cases February 2020.

To reach close 10,000 cases per day look way back January, COVID cases worst Florida.

That's would call simply noting deaths continued decline since February

The topic cases. Cases happen now. 

Death happens later. It’s pretty simple. don’t want announce booster people less likely get vaccinated. Pfizer knew said fuck we’ll announce deal consequences fauci Pretty much 🙃 Good. Plus prison time please  Exactly! worked for, well, anybody who’s done covid. Right, lot people even get symptoms, lot people got symptoms never got tested, etc. Florida state people last chance life. states know undercounting probably evens out. can't compare place like San Francisco transparent throughout pandemic rest country. guy helped pave way mRNA vaccines lying? think lot people hearts, knew wouldn’t 2 weeks it’s easier tell that… I'm looking forward catching first cold since 2019  Antidotal confirm that. Two people know vaccinated one thought allergies chest cold. got tested someone knew gym unvaccinated got hit hard. Even unusual vaccinated people sick let alone multiple group I'm willing bet impression immune write something else. Yes, precisely this. *Space lasers cause wildfires, climate change*. easier evil boogeyman, rather companies love trust, like Shell Exxon etc etc Lol, people saying Covid-19 2% death rate... joke.  starting get like people died COVID people instantly like well must old/fat/sick something else. new variant nasty.  That's true all. accounts 88% new cases shocking ... said one. risks medication routinely take far higher miniscule easily treatable risk. example, 10k people die US every year internal bleeding caused counter NSAID painkillers like Aleve (I actually hospitalized teenager it.) Yet imagine antivaxxers still take without much thought. Right. Covid mostly afterthought end year world people get vaxxed runs it’s course.   Since day one, personal responsibility, mandates not. Cheaters gonna cheat either way. medical condition prohibits getting vaccine might get reasonable accommodation work.

Unless healthcare come contact patients. accommodations, different career path. Feck off. associates making billions it.  Well still got COVID getting J&amp;J vaccine, so... Canadian, promise he's wrong. 80% country first dose, half second, we're still mega lockdowns Ontario. joke, entire province pissed. Good luck everyone, next 9 years going sad. Yup, Utrecht, Groningen Amsterdam really exploding. entire week, Groningen worst, last 2 days, Utrecht worst. student cities. city, Hague, lots students, really ""student city"", rise cases still happening, lot less extreme.  Providing interact rest population don’t won’t. leverage insurance companies medical supply. 

I work organization large percentage hospitals outpatient centers. Lots leverage buying capital equipment insurance contracts. 

What company going go insurance carrier contract largest healthcare provider county.  Huh, that’s England’s playing mostly home. first night second Moderna dose, heart rate pretty fast, probably double normal resting rate, around 110-120bpm, maybe something this. me. colds practically incapacitating. I'll keep mask on. I'm recovering now. Summer colds suck. want tracking responsive that, that's gonna work me. Damn. sounds terrible. I’m sorry hear that. :-( Yeah least close borders really close them, largely prevent importation new strains. point direction alpha variant significant variant trials? SA, beta primary variant, Brazil - p.2 prevalent. hear right could go nightclubs without proper certificate?

Vaccination rates among young low assume? Fly flag! Yes. Almost hospitals ditched masks well. think 70-80% people get vaccine? Eurostar London Brussels, foreigners test 72 hours travel gives confidence people train negative days ago. Belgians test day arrival Belgium, surprise travel knowing they're sick.

I trip people station waiting room London clear continuous cough sitting busy train hours. That's true. discussed delta variant length.

Here increase infections alone troubling lead deaths—both increase cases overwhelming health system—early research suggests Delta possibly dangerous Alpha variant twice likely lead hospitalization.

But Forbes. would suggest finding information sub directly CDC instead. sub excellent place look discuss source material. know 'unpopular fact' fact. would suggest reading Fox news relying keep oneself getting vaccinated. Lol. Nice try China. swear God literally felt like HEART ATTACK couple days vaccine. really craziest feeling. scare anyone away getting vaccine obviously, I’m sure lot side effects go unreported. . . Like supposed contact? girlfriend tried taking hospital didn’t want get hit bill telling there’s nothing done.   first dose around 80% effective, great normally. isn’t much, specifically situation dancing drinking nightclub. 

Short proximity people, heavy breathing, ingestion poison weakens immune system (drinking alcohol) person libertarian believes strongly personal sovereignty responsibility, understand people cannot handle personal responsibility, requires intervention governing body sometimes. 

It's like kids cat knocks expensive item breaks it, think, ""This cannot nice things."" people dumb and/or careless, ruin rest us. Wow... just... wow. I’m sorry. makes feel better, it’s entirely possible get lucky, you’re young enough require parental consent, you’re less likely affected severely.

Take much precaution can. Good masks good fit, social distancing, reducing number opportunities exposure, hand washing/not touching face, open windows and/or air purifiers, etc.

Maybe there’s sneaky way get vaccinated / old enough (normally don’t recommend things behind one’s parents’ backs, 100% right body health!). 

I mean, adult signed vaccine event online nobody checked anything. It’s free everyone, far know there’s requirement provide insurance info even ask. Stop downplaying danger. flu worse year kill like 50k Americans. killing way year. Kinda? known risk kind vaccine, theoretical vaccine actually use. arent finding side effect now, happen: they're reporting actual numbers article. reason airing side antivaccer could've found linked article, chose comment first. Sure, that's 300+ people daily develop long COVID. It'll non-trivial amount lose sense smell taste. 

All people, inexplicable reason, still refuse get vaccinated. Mindboggling. they’re fully vaccinated help? Holy shit get free fucking vaccine that’s every Walgreens America. Ah ok, I've noticed counties think would higher vaccination rates. Like Brooklyn, seems like well-to-do areas overwhelmingly vaxxed, rest not. Ok that’s cool. left alone then? don’t want vax left deal covid myself? monumental push get it? corona virus over. got jabbed state removed mask mandate. We’re good It’s privacy intrusion don’t know people think good.  Another friendly suggestion: learn differentiates sarcasm dick Almost like drunks aren’t allowed drive all? Lmao. That’s apt comparison friends split time Tampa Sutton QC (on VT border) and...there's reason go Tampa winter. 

Vermont winters tough unless really committed outdoors. 

I dunno, love Vermont. people great, less. close 70% adults fully vaccinated many areas, 55% population. Yes effect nowhere near enough herd immunity, especially Delta. would likely need 80+% entire population, adults (or like 95% adults) vaccinated now. still spreads. Florida! say cut losses, trench state line, nudge sea. make DC 50th state even change flag! I'm never leaving Vermont again. We've got everything need right here. rest country go fuck itself. San Francisco County 47 square miles. LA County 4,800 square miles. It’s literally difference typical radio tower Eiffel Tower. I’m vaxxed. don’t care.  I’m fully vaccinated don’t want show papers go see band play. It’s another vector social control information gathering hope people don’t stand it. I’m also pissed even conversation anti vax idiots.

Remember encroachments privacy personal freedoms 9/11? bullshit ever get rolled back?

I’m inclined want support venue insists this. It’s intrusive. trust numbers fro China? Compare north South dakota please tell stricter rules let better numbers?

I need numbers Chinese government. expats living China reporting strict measures lifted way countries. examples China hosting international events without issue.

Also, comparing states within US disingenuous travel states dont help them.

We already plenty studies showing masks help reduce number infections. Go spread narrative someone selfish enough believe distance doesnt work aërosols Unless distance plus 8 meters.

Refer above. There's also reason social distancing recommended along wearing papers years.

Why actually give source regards saying measures dont work

Based might work. see fall back season again.

Imagine doubting efficacy vaccines literally **all** available data numerous countries shows actually now, live seeing worse numbers last year summer, dispite vaccine. stricter measures.

Where living mean time consititional right stript. bunlaw allowed hug mom, Kids school.

Why source people abiding rules

If country still facing high number cases daily, exactly people abide enjoy anually booster shot

I enjoy it, I'll certainly prefer developing long forcing Kids act biological shield long covid dont drag cesspool

Oh, stay *yours* away rest us. dude knows answer question. wants argue people lmao. depends level risk willing take. very, unlikely get covid, still possible. I'm personally ok risk, everyone is, that's ok.   ""as service"" usually refers paying ongoing fee service company provides you. 

Manufacturing selling dose vaccine really service. Neither selling prescription drugs. buying product.  understand use one slice Swiss one slice Cheddar sandwiches: Cheddar insurance cheese still went theme park  Stop. Don't. Come back. joke? part reason one create bioweapons ounce sense viruses bacteria evolve beyond ones control. Even develop vaccines cures. That's kind do. opposed chemical nuclear weapons. 

So bioengineered viruses could absolutely evolve. quite quickly. 

Also technology spiraling beyond inventors control commonplace cliché. don’t solution. would let free deny it.

Again, would solution? Here's couple extra tables.

The scope conversation tunnelled vax vs vax, many discussions around things people hesitant get jabbed might reduce chance infection. example interesting research dandelion extract certain CBD extracts modulating ACE2 receptor; gateway COVID infects us. course, large scale pharma-conglomerates interested funding fast-tracking studies, unfortunately. vaccine becomes topic conversation. 

Sadly days see many echo chambers / polarized people either agreeing one another throwing insults group. people tend stick circles people share similar outlook. 

I’m finding common reason vaccine hesitancy peoples personal experiences let medical system and/or political interference. good example suppression cannabis medicine decades - businesses groups rolling vaccines. manufacturers also less stellar track record comes putting profits health outcomes. there’s often picture ridiculous unfounded conspiracies, although certainly taken gospel worryingly large number people interesting learning evaluate sources properly. 

When you’ve lost multiple loved ones directly suppression knowledge and/or prescribed medications went wrong - becomes easier empathize understand levels mistrust present. Anti-vaxxer’s care .000001% millions affected Covid. 2021-07-10 USA Vaccination demographics update

Seriously health authorities even want acknowledge this? many discussions completely ignore this?

I doctor friend think real besides hospitalized patients may never recover - why? agree number studies seem like BS all, symptoms could brought isolation lockdowns would happen control group ... all. Also ""long covid"" taking bit 12 weeks recover, biggest deal feeling better every week.

With caveats, studies generally say 10-30% people infected covid (even mild initially asymptomatic) get it. people say less likely get long covid mild infection, that's hospitalized people get long covid, rare among people mild infections.

Also, study could find **estimates vaccine's protection 30% long covid infected**: know credible study is. got almost media attention. really hope that's thoughts seems way low, simply vaccines good protection hospitalization, effect bigger alone. 20 minute ride lot ppl Please post links Discord server. check official Discord server menu tab.

That's Chile high vaccination rates. 100% population vaccinated, 100% deaths among vaccinated, lol. ther trial, found Sinovac reduced COVID-related deaths something like 86% hospitalizations 90%.

Does mean patient even know infected, cold maybe even bad cold hospital death routine outcome one got sick SARS-CoV-2 date?

Said another way, breakthrough actually mean?

I got imagine means cold, maybe even bad cold much less concern Public Health would okay that.

Basically vaccines work, perfectly.

Alameda county dropped death toll 25%. San Francisco 3x many overdose deaths covid. haven’t heard stories willfully ignorant point. Colorado similar overcount issue. Yes. Netherlands nearly vaccination rates US. probably get higher due less vaccine hesitancy. go nightclubs without proper certificate?

Technically Netherlands need App called CoronaCheck phone entering. Essentially QR code scan door staff see vaccinated not. 

Only know Ireland live rolling identical app based Netherlands model. 

Independent.ie - [Ireland may adopt approach Dutch indoor 

But someone else mentioned comments. Netherlands already flawed, young people taking screenshots QR codes sending mates. ""disaster""? like UK, death rate, really matters, dropped one tenth used be. purely political point view, policy might make lot sense.

I'm sure government statisticians worked many healthy kids die mass vaccination programme compared many would die mass virus outbreak, psychologists advise public react vaccine-induced deaths compared virus-induced ones.

Even risks extremely low (and seem case), single healthy kid suddenly dropping dead heart condition caused vaccine could cause panic. Yeah, that's hard reality, anecdotal statistic. 

The SECOND announced masks mandatory anymore last second saw masks. I'm literally one wearing one go grocery shopping, people look like I'M idiot.

""No choice take summertime measures face rapid increase infections | News item | Government.nl"" 'Covid lab-leaked' theory still exist? already know NSA spy everyone email?

And Wuhan labs got funding US, definitely within spying power US. fact US also know everything lab, case China really develop biological weapon there?

If US collusion China, investigation yield nothing anyway, right? US got affected Covid, would know still let happened?

Am missing something here? Working vaccination/testing site, know Testen voor Toegang locations separate ggd-locations also counted differently/separate. positives reported RIVM included GGD numbers positivity. Fucking brilliant going well Spain &amp; Portugal, seems track continue so.

I however doubt jump number 1 spot, countries high vaccine uptake (denmark, Ireland fx)

Denmark currently 70% first dose (40% second dose) 12+ age bracket vaccinating ca 1,4% population per day July (might slow bit end month due vacation). Unfortunately ourworldindata problem showing DK data. know MRNA vaccines effective Delta anymore? 2 variants back square one vaccines. woke morning vaccine ignored cause though cause lying heavily left side fuck talking about? countries huge political issue. Vaccinating athletes eligible at-risk citizens gotten chance get vaccine often seen big no-no. Privilege, etc., ....

My personal position is: reserve right send athletes, staff, journalists NOC freeloaders Japan, feel required we, good polite guests, make sure numpties send vaccinated. think I'm going wait know still. scary!  Meanwhile we’re back indoor concerts states. Guessing happening 3, 2, 1..  find curious mandatory vaccination considered unacceptable violation personal choice, yet mandatory infection (the strategy England apparently adopting) not. Calls $RONA    Whoa 😳 pfizer got really similar side effects: got bad went clinic told really, really dehydrated get mean, get vaccinated mean virus walk right pass you. still carry virus people vaccinated. Massive crowd avoided possible. lot (maybe exams/retakes), mostly due partying. Keep eye percentage positive tests tests done want get away argument it’s ‘just’ testing. Sadly, one’s going exponentially well; around 14.6% something along lines, similar last lockdowns (Christmas). friend got serious complications ""recovering"" covid. realise one exceptions, small percentage people happens. Either way, I'd rather part statistics. see happen anyone else. Indeed still mandatory GGD sites, makes sense.

Because testing sites highest proportion infected people (1 10 20).

And vaccination sites highest proportion people yet fully vaccinated 2 weeks (basically 100%).

But hospitals high proportion risk (vulnerable) people. Well vaccine, odds even lower. sorry endure 3 whole days feeling like shit. course, symptoms overlap covid symptoms, common sense says get tested. Universities Netherlands on-campus living facilities. Students usually live city. Better lock 2 weeks stop spread! least stop superspreading events, guess mix cover-up, incompetence, impossibility. think properly count 2.5mil death 4 weeks even want to. literally nothing article posted suggest ""can lead deaths—both increase cases overwhelming health system—early research suggests Delta possibly dangerous Alpha variant twice likely lead hospitalization.""

What else hard read?  got second dose (Moderna) two weeks ago. day after, extreme muscle pain, like Walmart brand red wine hangover. never suggested restricted information, actually quite clearly stated opposite.

Comments like prove point extra care given critical information conveyed population confuse densest less attentive among us, like yourself. 3 days? serious? Try sick 3 weeks even complications 3 months later actual covid. 3 days sound bad then, it? already know prevent common cold. We've seen work world-wide basis. wear masks. [Bullshit travels 200 MPH truth deciding motor oil still get coronavirus vaccinated, indeed number vaccination great Netherland. It’s shame got vaccinated today hassle lot, probably waited something like 30 minutes getting shot one people, let tell you, never even got prescriptions 
1. fuck pharmacy
2. time could get feeling great
It felt like day two suffering, afterwards wouldve forgotten  found uses 15 μg dosing (compared 12 CureVac, 30 Pfizer &amp; 100 Moderna) find info ""it nucleoside-modified"", could link that? get passionate hatred towards China, 5% fully vaccinated, barking SinoVac missing boat.

I simply understand Indonesia slow, started campaign back January, what's holding progress? jj efficacy data versus weak based small sample. seems clear one dose mRNA vaccines protective delta even quite good variants. know long vaccine lasts?

In city see people everywhere still wearing masks, I'm one them. Delta strain going around lift mask mandate? There's literally nothing article posted suggest importantly provide evidence deadly, lol  Would chance resurgence Canada US, presuming get 80% fully vaxxed? 

Or matter enough needles arms ending distancing/safety rules? Hard experiment control group  fully vaccinated moderna vaccine since March. tested positive covid nasty symptoms. happing place ! careful social distance still get sick covid even fully vaccinated! advocating two shots like do, thought first dose giving enough immunity 2 weeks too, second shot really hit nail ? Apologies wrong  G F

I don’t fucking want covid. Yes idiot would refer 98.7% “majority”.   They're obviously worse toddlers.  got vaccine months ago, quit accusing something I’m not. encourage everyone same. said US… vaccinated people aren’t tested even though know breakthroughs happening post made LAST means vaccine working.

odds you’d feel worse actually getting covid regardless age group. 

and you’re vaccinated, it’s extremely rare you’ll get covid i’d say benefits far outweigh risk. Evidence points yes lets honest every age group. Germany today, area nearly covid past week therefore mask mandate...

Nearly everyone wearing masks, even outside market many stores still mandated masks anyway.

I hate Germans much better us. feel like Americans Europe complaining masks freedumbs. again, royally fucked over. huge subreddit. Also Delta variant aggressive enough make one dose effectiveness really pretty low. get much effectiveness second dose.  *You responsible decide approach next months.... concerned, may mean avoiding places people taking precautions.*

Ah sweet. Reddit’s safe then. Well that’s great news actually, means almost nobody serious risk Definitely thankful got vaccine, otherwise could’ve way worse that’s knowledge works.  second dose chest pain 2 days, never experienced anything like before. think it’s heart got inflamed? [The case fatality rate Delta UK 0.2%, compared 1.9% really mean Delta safer Alpha given individual -- reduced rate probably mostly function 1) vaccination, 2) Delta mostly hitting younger people UK -- good illustration see lower death rates US well given older people tend vaccinated No, I’m convinced thanks vaccine I'm surprised Johnson Johnson. Vaccines way! chances low even realistic risk. Mine definitely mild, mostly fatigue/fever/chills. hope aren’t lasting effects I'm sad hear Austin gave months months really solid effort. days go without death florida per CDC.

[Nope. many. seen here:]( It’s “these” people, it’s massive failure government. Stop making divisive sweeping statements, point finger correct direction.  [They COVID-denier, oppose lockdown fear-mongering.    Yes, exactly. Hence number likely far greater 283. really lost touch reality last 2 years Going forward, however, death rate much lower — category people far highest rate death (the elderly) also likely vaccinated.

That's true else held equal.

How mortality rate new variants compare earlier variants? followed closely. newer variants deadly — deadly e.g. younger people — factors could partially/wholly cancel even flip deadly.

As historical reference, 1918 flu pandemic primarily deadly older people first wave. second wave much deadly younger people. we're seeing similar pattern, mortality rates could stay relatively similar even get worse...  Sorry business serve kind. Please leave entrance area. youre vaccinated dont need mask up. think uptick even face ""average"" vax rates what's concerning. Many epidemiologists hoping moderate level vaccination would hold variants check mitigation measures like occupancy, distancing, masking reinstated. Even Israel relatively high level vaccination considering partial lockdowns. say let's stop trying convince stupid people get vax let nature take course. here. Nobody asked reporting symptoms. told doctor isnt like central database symptoms monitored. really need mask forever protect small percentage worlds population.

No. Everyone medically able get vaccine needs gets us herd immunity.

Especially medical advice boosts sales company large stock in. time comes boosters, pzier shown evidence created booster provides additional protections gets approved, start recommending people get give additional protections.  Pretty sure happened me. Got really short breath like week first dose one scare started hyperventilating thought calling 911 managed catch breath again. Got second dose Monday happening although bad first dose. 

When started happening googled see could vaccine side affect time articles saying vaccines categorically cause shortness breath, found cases. kind defensiveness helpful makes people trust experts, making definitive statements come back weeks later say ""oops, looks like cause heart inflammation sometimes"". honest know know.

Another question. article allow author list populate. Transparency never thing trump administration. Fauci mentioned would make announcements administration would contradict downplay whatever actually saying.  unless medically diagnosed imaging etc bunch people thread internet saying data. Due bloody history ex war occupations foreign powers especially Mongols, Russians seem ok surrendering freedom potential exchange security. That’s still guiding hand foreign policy today ex perceived threat Russian neighbours aligning west invasion justified. Considering issues state Covid statistics, blame people wanting corroborating evidence Right, inevitable covid vaccines get authorization likely end year guaranteed required. kind person taking issue likely going change mind even that. There's rational reason. They're going move goal posts irrational fear whatever motivates bizarrely ignorant behavior. Huh? said increase vaccines hospitalization deaths remain low.

That's important one accomplishments probably 10x substantial anything (or me) produce agree rare, 283 number seems way low, since several replies people got myocarditis. That's technically possible hugely unlikely. It’s hard understand booster wouldn’t needed time delta variant infecting fully vaccinated individuals.

No don’t. forgot vaccinations, make big difference. Florida 46% population fully vaccinated, 83% individuals age 65 (age group makes 80% COVID deaths) vaccinated Florida. [Source](http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/covid19-data/covid19_data_latest.pdf). 

This good news. much nearer peak February, March, April, May, June

In regards 7-day average? No.

February’s highest 7-day average ~9,800. March’s highest 7-day average ~5,400. April’s highest 7-day average ~6,000. May’s highest 7-day average ~5,000. June’s highest 7-day average ~1,900. 

So no, July’s current 7-day average 3,300/day nearer February, March, April, May. June. necessarily mean skyrocket back January’s 7-day average, also rose April skyrocket. Yeah, agree best idea. booked trip last year already payed able cancel without losing money. already postponed repeatedly numbers went last month Netherlands declared ""safe"", decided go trip instead postponing again. collect fines? IRS come pay? I've never India judging I've seen tv, normal everyday life super spreader event big cities. seems pretty much impossible socially distance real degree places overcrowded According news here, it’s lot transmissible deadly.
That shouldn’t good news though, virus dangerous enough is. know multiple people died it, young healthy.  article?

Secondly, bold assumption given extreme for-profit nature companies. government botch responses biotech companies act best interest. incompetent protecting people. logic, Spanish Flu never ended. don’t think moron unique Dutch. look around world pattern relaxation precautions + delta variant = complete shock/surprise resulting case surge. Huh, might I've getting bad (what thought was) even 1-3 beers used require seriously hungover. Seemed happen overnight time started accordance vax already tracked. mean walk tracking devices us daily. defensiveness lot thread helpful. point say people get vaccinated, honest potential side affects medication. downplay things like get proven wrong that's creates doubt makes people want get vaccinated. Yes spot IMO.

The actual article – passporting – suspect leaked 'story' press encourage people get 1st/2nd doses. vaccination rate dramatically fallen last month so. 

I really think Government would go passporting domestic events. Totally different story foreign travel though! rotation known Europe much"" wrong statement. 


Thanks cutting quote got point end sentence. Awesome know I'm arguing someone interested winning arguing good faith. 

The rest argument similarly cherry picking I've said links provided. 

I interest continuing debate manner. case we'd seeing reports similar worse back April/May overwhelmed hospitals etc. see things calmed lot. 

Even numbers vastly undercounted still anywhere near herd immunity delta strange short lived peak We'll absolutely fewer deaths - high-risk people vaccinated. Look outside Denver/Boulder. live medium sized town NoCo. Housing expensive, in. Everything thing else comparable cost. think worth it. I’m sorry deleted. Glad you’re back. true. massive unvaccinated rest world *far far* effect virus mutating percentage mostly vaccinated US.  Strawmans everywhere like 500 (technically 1,000 well haha), makes even worse.

You might want look growth rate cases Utrecht Safety Region. +1,020%. Absolutely look cases Utrecht. look 7-day average, look number cases last 2 days. 793. Previous record (excluding yesterday) 339. 222 cases per 100,000 (0.222% pop. tested positive 1 sure late now. ask doctor. That's barely making difference though. falsified test results entry letting 100s people party whilst partygoers mostly unvaccinated. Also, get Johnson vaccine could party without test without waiting period Great see come out, 26m, shape, got second vaccine Wednesday, felt like heart attack Thursday night intense chest pains, tried research white paper identified potential, indication treatment plan simply ‘seek medical attention’ (no reason $250 copay emergency room visit they’re gonna tell take aleve). Called doctor tele-visit low behold, advised take pain killers. 

Hopefully study help medical professionals informed, say 283 number seems bullshit since even 50+ days ago go back Reddit threads see people (I think registered nurse thread) talking chest pain.  shocking new discovery, revealed majority bear attacks happen places bears live. article someone smoked comment someone said ""smoking harmful, zero health effects"" would obviously agree article happened someone smoked while.

Or article someone stage 4 cancer someone left comment saying ""the survivability rate cancer 2 percent"" would make sense you, blanket statement like that? 

Come on. Jeeeeeeeeeeeeez….

Edit. 

Added two “e”. Makes sense either. mask wearing considered nuisance? automatically put mask whenever go outside habit now, don’t even need think anymore. makes suspect people never properly complied mask policy begin with, otherwise wouldn’t making big deal it.  suspended Twitter “hijacked tons people’s accounts forced follow her”??? thinks she’s like advanced computer hacker?

From Wikipedia, “ Jones granted formal whistleblower status Florida Office Inspector General May 2021.”

Also sending swat team someone’s house messaged people speak seriously strong sign right. shit reminds Russia Oh yeah government totally profits people wearing masks!!!!!! stop moving Canada cannot. real question u keep tally half population illiterate? conspiracy poor places cover literally can't tally it, difficult understand? Woah buddy, Olympics still, point going gold mental gymnastics then. kids 12 well. Per recent CDC guidence still recommend masks, district likly require them.

 Keeping home option much anyway.

Having tracked covid data closely entire pandemic expect current rise cases look lot like last summer, last fall / winter.  It’s fine wants wear one, angry fact people consider nuisance. it’s simply normal, never be. wits end try pick pieces best safe (apart %¢€$√`°%% people faked tests party is); totally get you. Whole lotta COVID deniers get really sick die shockingly make public announcements got sick/died COVID.

Seeing usual amount ""Just lost uncle/grandpa/father/etc."" posts... COVID deniers gonna admit COVID, least announce social media. background rate younger populations. That’s significant. Iceland mask mandates pretty much gone. outside &amp; inside lots people weeks. group tested twice, coming in, going out, &amp; times tested negative. That's happens masses get vaccine, country takes testing &amp; tracing seriously, &amp; one idiots one listens makes political movement it. Goggles doubled face masks. may look silly, best do. exactly right numbers game. spikes third world countries like Brazil India sites big mutations. forget plades like US UK done much better job testing, numbers may seem higher simply due many tests available (hell, look US April 2020 test yet compared April 2021).

Infection rates third world countries *vastly* underreported three reasons. 1 - country cannot test many people. 2 - people cannot access test due living situation. 3 - people likely healthier younger bad infection. people area, though documented well, still go viral replication process provides possibility error RNA replication trigger next big mutation. protect vulnerable vaccinating everyone. vaccinate elderly immunocompromised let disease spread everyone else, quickly overcome vaccine (not mention make lot people sick risk permanent disability). don’t give measles vaccine people 70+ organ transplant… coming creators, coming CEO company also selling product, FDA zero vested interest selling general public anything, also full scientists understand read data. guy Pfizer scientist exactly mean anything? Viruses developed lab can't evolve? sounds like shoddy star trek logic. Yeah got point tbf. Nobody knows went wrong India.

Have good day 2 studies mentioned recent ones posted everywhere, one J&amp;J one Dan Barouch. 3rd, 90% effectiveness quote, may coming South African medical workers study I’ve seen headlines actual data posted yet. something goes away or? *North Korea entered chat*  Well no, cases age ranges rising again: Lol probably gonna shave stubble huh... Dr. Fauci said Sunday program there's difference giving ""medical"" advice official ""public health"" guidance &amp; authorization. case speaking following J&amp;J single-dose mRNA ""booster"", similar. said government agencies can't spell clear guidelines without extensive peer-reviewed testing. personal physicians subject scrutiny. Dr. Fauci said use best judgment prescribe treatments may limited data. That's prerogative &amp; trained do. effect he's saying ""booster"" doled case case basis, depending age, health condition, level exposure, etc. he's perfectly fine approach. “Hey look guy empathy caring people around him?! NERDDDD!!”  Indeed stay lower otherwise, current situation NL beyond comparable UK. 

Hopefully change soon people adjust behaviour accordingly.  Wouldn’t bad thing? rate cases means deaths. ELI5? FL ton tourists, includes snowbirds (who may live 4-5 months year), even people live 4+ years going college count ""residents"" somehow count matter caught COVID FL, infectious FL, even died FL?? Thats completely untrue. Yeah mentioning changing rules counts COVID numbers political members political party it. statements throughout various threads problematic though, agree. Uh 15%?  ok person high blood pressure take moderna Pfizer? Ok, dumb? thought ambulance attached particular hospital? Like, obviously sometimes bring patients other, guess thought usually stay within certain... Jurisdiction? Combination opening city Delta variant. Get vaccinations, people. excuse point. 3 pharmacies taking walk-in appointments. makes sense first comment. read like concerned safety EUA something. I’ve heard numerous people act like Full Authorization mean it’s safe, accounts that’s full authorization means  think both, correlation like said, causation. think something it, time people vaccinated still get tested positive. mean close country. probably fewer deaths, I'm predicting high infection rates likely hospitalizations younger people taking seriously. Basically sitting getting vaccinated, don't. Every little bit point important  Well good thing: test capacity already pretty much reached, cases rise anymore! (Trump mode off) I've provided facts sources. wanna prove good faith discussion, time eat crow, admit wrong, go back edit post informing everyone hospitalizations fact rise.

You're worked can't tell talking wrong CDC - hospitalizations 8% last 7 days - 21 days see trend worth worrying tremendous downward slope last months wave like patterns well.

So, lied 100% - nice put perspective, Florida 20% people Netherlands number cases. Pfizer took page EA sports DLC playbook. really? hear real world data Sinopharm great compared J&amp;J gets job done. FL Gov Man Strikes Again!  That’s clear statement. kid young I’m saying “I want EUA released stop worrying.” statement reads like concerned general want full authorization. 

Wanting kid vaccinated would something like “I can’t wait kid eligible” “can’t wait X age eligible” Agent Smith entered chat  Cases solid predictor hospitalizations. definitely care them. boris choose put UK 8 month severe lockdown autumn next summer anyway close everything anyway none really matters worked double blind studies faulty observational studies.    Possibly. transmission easier mutation, mutation directly help spread pathogen death increased, decreased, stays same.

Yes, keeping infected human alive helps spread dying sooner hurts spread, transmission easier, drive spread. Generally, spread much covid presymptomatic early symptomatic phases, deadliness affect spreadability much transmissability.  Where? coronavirus? single person, evaluate risks several complicated processes?
I.e. estimating bad virus might might be. Florida 400k cases per day could infect every single citizen less 2 months. That's one way end this. Since moving Netherlands February never felt like measures taken seriously maybe living. Even vaccination centre people social distance even attempt social distance walking streets part. fact yet 5-12 year olds.  suprisedpikachu.jpg complete misinformation. unlikely get transmit virus fully vaccinated. 100%, vaccine is.  want kids able get vaccinated   worries EUA right, live Germany, near dutch border, drive far... 

Still valid point, claim great idea go there. get rules, friends family say ""governor name says need it. Freedom"" yea... issue You’re right, imprecise language. said less selective pressure favor success already existing vaccine-resistant variant situation people aren’t vaccinated. circumstances, vaccine resistance isn’t necessarily decisive competitive edge. Germany definitely slowing bit now. approaching 60% one-shot, demand non-vaccinated started drop two weeks ago. reported 80% people say interested vaccine, numbers low Germany people seem putting off, people can't find time easily get shot. going problem us can't get 80% September. 

The government puts nice info webpage: sacked get benefits, laid off. numbers game, test used 0,3% false negativity rate. test 450000 times let people loose carrying virulent version among non vaccinated populace get this. Deaths UK increased 4-fold. Deaths lag cases least 3 weeks cases increased 3.5-fold last 3 weeks. Therefore expect absolute minimum 14-fold increase deaths. real metric matters hospitalizations. amount infected doesn’t matter long aren’t using emergency room capacity  correct. FDA said. I’m Canada, weeks, partner wondering what’s going USA, one talking delta, fully reopening half-assed vax rates, one seems care aware covid isn’t yet. Then, overnight it’s like light switch went there.  Thanks, thought CDC said 90 days checked that’s certain circumstances. NHS website says 28 days that’s bad. Yes. refused fake data pattern denial ain't river Egypt something else? aunt Sue don’t 😭😭😭 Yes everyone got last year obviously. looks like covid would order 14% total deaths (doing head) US. right. never read lawyer generally enjoy reading statutes/bills free time. However, even did, think would choose read GOP clickbait bill definitely struck courts.  35% anti-vaxx bothered uneducated. West exporting shitton vaccines nations, dunno wtf talking bud. Shhh... talk exist. That's attitude many people here.  Yeah get shot J&amp;J go clubbing night. Without testing ""vacinated"" gov fucked big time 40hour pcr test max 24hours. Precisely. death rate COVID 1 50, 1 1000. 

If anti-vax support removing social distancing mask rules, know 400 people like you, chances 8 people die COVID. Can't wait turn around blame liberal socialist communists lying hoax pandemic auntie Sue uncle Cletus dead. Thanks link. context buried, say actual bill mention anything like that. 

So reasonable, regardless political affiliation spokesperson politican SAY one thing, would value actual bill says word-of-mouth. 

I'll keep eye this. appreciate sending that.  know new variants can/will do. lady history bizarre behavior. It’s attacking reputation it’s fact untrustworthy. 

Btw Florida resident actually believe Florida done better job pandemic many large states. one happy we’re back normal. got vax life back thankfully. problem people don’t get vax die. sad it’s point. People need take responsibility themselves. mandating definitely good thing. sub thaaat authoritarian?  keep mind link wasn’t discovered recently. myocarditis, doctor agrees even though didn’t run tests, got second jab April one even knew possibility. much tell it. heart doesn’t work right palpitations (which never before) make pretty obvious something going on. Yeah stats alpha. get infected delta variant now. Efficacy hospitalization 93% Pfizer. Moderna similar. patient's son tell vaccine caused heart attack.... 2011. He's even hospitalized heart problems happens children get EUA approved? Minimum FDA [approval include declared emergencies states emergency also includes benefits outweighing risks. [new UK indicates 0.000002% chance child UK contracting getting seriously ill COVID. sure COVID vaccine children less 0.000002% chance serious illness? Even UK study, FDA advisors [split EUA ""There four hospitalizations per one million children, emergency low hospitalization rate,” said Cody Meissner, professor pediatrics Tufts University School Medicine.""

&amp;#x200B;

For months now, seems lot people adamant achieve herd immunity declare pandemic &lt;12 vax approved. then, kids, masks social distancing mandated assumption EUA authorized wait bit more.. stated above, foregone conclusion. get EUA, going kids live like indefinitely keep waiting? going reach place children simply deemed safe enough COVID allow normal lives again?

&amp;#x200B;

I vaxxed want children vaxxed BTW. wrote I’m telling wasn’t. free interpret however want though makes happy. One interesting things covid pandemic almost totally wiped influenza fairly doable behavioral adjustments. living centuries, turns quite possible drive cases low.

I'm arguing stay covid style lockdown forever, important lessons learned here. believe numbers Delta set stone yet contradictory UK Israel. Monkey laugh    thing is, *not* new tech. That's something people need understand. seem think mRNA vaccines appeared nowhere, coronavirus exist prior COVID-19. virus spreading vaxxed unvaccinated people. need oppose people!   comparing two one hundred percent. good day. Holy shit, that's impressive.

Should also translate severe case histories? seem recall Delta cause deaths need mechanical ventilation might outdated. got second vaccine April even knew possibility. People tell it. notice heart doesn’t work right. never palpitations suddenly got palpitations resting heart rate Apple Watch literally spiked day got dose. symptoms myocarditis never went hospital bc wasn’t public info yet. feel like heart attack times, really would stop telling people didn’t experience something. course not, they're full shit. worst like 1 1000 people dying it

Mortality 2-3% across globe. 2 3 every 100.  part left vs right plan. Yes course referencing newsom, way supporting desantis even comparing two. People learn mistakes. depends upon big mistakes are. *could* work yes, know. viruses mutate others. Some, like measles, etc, mutate slowly vaccines remain effective. Others, like flu need updated yearly. cold, mutates fast even bother vaccines. 

So depends, right guess hindsight see way went. 

I'm optimistic, certain. I'm hoping darwin awards though lol. I'm fed people. People learn mistakes. depends upon big mistakes are. USA one country getting vaccine issue. 

It's people choosing get it. Depending issue is, getting vaccines might properly set protection immuno compromised. reported getting vaccines, immuno, checked activation, little nothing.

Doctor told person walk around he/she get vaccine even though person got both. means mask avoid crowded places. say cannot?

I doubt explaining help since July 2021 likely read billion times care, REDUCTION ZERO. Reduction still great. 

Vaccination reduces chance catching covid, passing covid severe reaction it.

But yes, def sounds deranged.  see. assumed would followed similar approach Singaporean 'neighbours'. They're nearly four times ahead.

Seems tragic amazing response, truly amazing 2020, let go drain 2021 moving aggressively enough vaccines.  may sorry enjoy podcasts, TWiV favorite. recent study Singapore also suggests vaccination provides pretty good protection severe Covid-19 disease Delta variant. 
  
 
*A Singapore study found COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer/Moderna) provides 69 per cent protection infection Delta variant coronavirus, regardless symptoms, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said Wednesday (Jul 7).* 
 
*Citing study National Centre Infectious Diseases (NCID) Ministry Health (MOH), said data also showed vaccine's protection symptomatic disease “between 80 90 per cent”.* 
 
*“Effectiveness vaccination severe COVID-19 disease, requiring oxygen supplementation, ICU (intensive care unit) care death, 93 per cent,” added.* see attitude place. got mine, screw everyone else. think people know sounds, else honestly lack empathy compassion.

Even narcissistic self-involved person acknowledge, though, unchecked global pandemic involving rapidly mutating virus going affect one way another. Either emergence virulent strain result billions people incubating virus, collapse economic activity around world keeping globalized economy crawl.

The best-case scenario pandemic understanding interconnected are, need work together. need improved attitude future crises coming pike. Maryland 100% people died June unvaxxed. really kinda though, drive perfectly fine one. kill way people daily COVID now. near one cause more. qualification missing? even can't seen catch it.

And ahhhhh yes, I'm 'obtuse fuck' incapable valid counterpoint? I'll take it. problem! currently hospital, Cardiac catheter yesterday.

You read posts it. German though. I'm German.  Awful. hope recovers!  It’s obvious myocarditis. doctor literally run test sometimes comes heart palpitations. aren’t slapping diagnosis people feel weak light headed. It’s easy tell someone it. Remote learning removed option longer chose that. must pull child school homeschool send child back school likely one else masking around them. …which replicate faster make people contagious sooner strains.

You make exact argument implications COVID harmful mutations. fact, there's studies already suggesting meaningful long term implications, especially harsher symptoms.

We enough short-term data mRNA COVID vaccines long-term data mRNA vaccines deem vaccines safe, especially safer diceroll unvaccinated person takes inevitably catch COVID. 

Would rather trust mutating soup deadly virus? vaccine mostly protects deadly virus, also solid data behind it.

*But let's say vaccines unforseen significant health ramifications*. Since populous took vaccines, including corporate billionaires politicians, know gaurenteed solutions funded quickly developed. can't say varying unique COVID-strain side effects occur unvaccinated people. take risk soon leave house.

Your thinking flawed. I’m Fauci supporter don’t understand one. 

Pfizer said last week booster needed deal variants - specifically response study published Israel regarding efficacy Pfizer’s vaccine delta variant. 

Why would Fauci claim know booster requirements vaccine creators? funny thing statement side think you’re talking them.

And many people take advantage impossibility falsifying it. know percentages work? 2% 1 50.

Let's use Unites states example people use talking point. Source: * 100 = 1.8%

Not quite 1 50, damn close. Let's skip end use world numbers:

(4021654/186209144) * 100 = 2.16%

So little 1 50. That's math. Feel free go country country. stats rarely deviate far, except special circumstances I’m lying Lilili! Wassupp Lilili! Wassupp think story fear mongering. many US vaccinated want pretend pandemic over. self-centered view world. US cases rising, mostly among unvaccinated, everyone start little cautious. See hate kind argument way prove either side. know little mitigate spread? Maybe done huge job mitigating spread would far worse. Maybe didn’t. can’t prove something didn’t happen. Lilili! Wassupp    here's Washington Post became politicized

*Children’s risk appears increased problems well. According recent CDC report, 30 121 young people died healthy, 91 least one underlying medical condition, 54 two more. included chronic lung diseases asthma, well obesity, neurological developmental conditions, cardiovascular numbers since revised ""over 90%"" underlying co-morbidities...per Robert Redfield, CDC Director speculating may worried about.  ""Florida averages 3,380+ new COVID-19 cases per day delta variant surges""

Clearly wrong. Yea think every country see spike cases due Delta variant. question restrictions based hospital capacity cases. know Catalonia closed nightclubs imposed modest restrictions, it? knows. dont think appetite another lockdown especially hospitals overwhelmed. June 20th US 4053 new case day. yesterday 35000. I’m tired people saying this. Sometimes case. always. Please take seriously India went 10k cases day 400k cases day   reported total 950 new coronavirus cases Saturday, highest daily number since May 7. big picture: world closely watching Japan's case count, summer Olympics due begin Tokyo July 23.Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga declared state emergency Tokyo following surge cases, begin Monday August 22. new infections recorded today increased last Friday's total 716, ""rising week-on-week 21st consecutive day,"" Japan Times writes .   Excellent! Weird didn’t get vaccine I’m still alive fuck. probably without taking vaccine 38% people Netherlands fully vaccinated, 46% Florida fully vaccinated, 64% Netherlands least 1 dose, 54% Florida least 1 dose...  

We different I.  First, Israeli data indicates vaccines much effective *against hospitalization*.

Second, lot objections way analysis done. check Ashish Jha’s Twitter feed details that. UK studies controlled lot more, found closer 90% efficacy symptomatic disease 80% efficacy symptomatic/asymptomatic disease. That's true sort thing, done I'm sure, Russians trying get people power US ones want interfering such, checked. Jewish Laser beams fame? LOL

Shouldn’t laugh. It’d funny wasn’t also terrifying time. trolling, seen. Even study linked found effective adults school setting. basically herd immunity pretty good. lot people moved since beginning covid seems helped anything, people moving actually believe virus/vaccine. Let's hope sheds light exact chain animals virus made jump from. might invaluable information. 
Also, forgive asking stupid question, researchers find exact match og strain wild, reverse engineered( dunno makes sense) mutations virus went found match strain? still get seriously ill, reduced risk. necessarily true, it’s foolish assume case one everyone room vaccinated, extremely low risk spread. helps keep economy open freedom high got vaccine, provides incentive didn't. fair keep insisting vaccinated people play rules low risk. 

We know testing, masking, quarantining effective also nuisance, let decide would rather things vaccinate continue things hard way. flat emberrasing. Meanwhile cabinet refuses admit dropped covid measures early, saying responsible move way know caseload would expload violently. There's thing called trend reading graphs  ‘Reported” key word here. knows actual number cases. took 10 years find natural link SARS still popular knowledge AIDS came from. media political circles make sure conspiracy drowns investigation long time. country understaffed, corrupt incompetent. buy single vaccine, get donations covax system... Humanity awful. Counts never 0. one human disease ever eradicated, smallpox. Every disease still cases. (While virus) freaking plague still around, even US. still consider threat?  Someone buy natural resources, cutting nordstream pipeline give business fracking companies poisoning land water causing earthquakes. 

Renewables yes, shortage buyers natural resources, forces even worse public health Russians, like fracking oil companies. Authoritarians use culture wars sell citizens corporate interests.  problem people dying gimmick culture war. taken UK since late May reach half peak caseload winter, steady increase cases. We've gone far beyond beating week. I've back gym year point. think there's reason vaccinated person would ""scared"" go gym. Serious question, go anywhere daily life still quarantined? Thank details

 example monoclonal antibodies? keep putting shit stories like it’s wonder conspiracy theories thrive “But benefits outweigh risks” 😂 actually exact opposite, vaccines better natural capable stimulating better immune response natural infection.** hoped vaccines COVID-19 provide protective immunity least long natural immunity longer, still offered vaccine even you’ve COVID-19 past. likely that, significant proportion population, vaccine induce effective longer lasting immunity induced natural infection. Hence recommended everyone take vaccine immunity disease absent low, new evidence shows protective antibodies generated response mRNA vaccine target broader range SARS-CoV-2 variants carrying “single letter” changes key portion spike protein compared antibodies acquired also fact (most) vaccines, get two shots, get initial booster. natural infection there's second ""booster"". know what's worse living third world still people want AZ wait Pfizer.  Yeah although mention ages. could 90+ already need third dose got shots February fingernails say bullshit vaccine.. He's trying failing pedantic definition ""immune"" wish shared confidence EUA schools shown highly effective

However, that's cases, believe. protection better regarding severe cases. bad Trump got it. Would better without him. praise someone told nation would spring 2020. Morons He's Republican party Anyone epidemiology would tell viruses mutate, may contagious, actually weaken virulence.

I so, tired repeated. commonly, happens. even remotely universal. 'rule' virus becomes contagious, also becomes less deadly. reddit factoid spread everywhere. supported epidemiology. reason viruses tend mutate become less deadly selective pressure. deadly normally means kills host chance spread, deadly people alter behaviors. Viruses become less deadly rule, mechanism behind it.

 


 


 


Covid fairly long presymptomatic period contagious, means selective pressure deadlier variant basically removed. Covid could theory mutate far deadly, long still spread without symptoms, would continue spread. basic evolution natural selection.

 fact natural immunity always better immunity inoculations

 


I'm gonna need source that, chief, vague ""the medical community says..."" made garbage. Fauci referring data many people fully vaccinated, though.  drop snark discuss things like reasonable people. Keep mind spread quickly 70% except regional outbreaks.   issue supply, willingness already turned around believing hoax believing lefty (trying avoid political post bot) plan wipe conservatives catching dying must bio engineered infect kill side...you make up!! ""The U.S. less vaccinated — they're probably going variant factory come fall,"" said, adding Canada needs address ""leaky quarantine ""We need better getting surveillance coming smarter systems actually proper quarantine tracking people cross border.""

Sharing border third world country like US really makes tough everyone else! *Without HEPA air cleaners, universal masking reduced combined mean aerosol concentration 72%. combination two HEPA air cleaners universal masking reduced overall exposure 90%.* weve seen thing mutate times since last year half, probably mutate again.  telling show front CVS expensive carbon fiber road bike, tight cycling shorts, shotgun 2 bud heavy 22oz, light cigarillo, blow covid smoke face call ""vaccoid"" going get stiffy ask number? hope mRNA changes this. get similar approval flu vaccines, could much shorter lead time flu season, could even tailor vaccine different regions different prevalent strains. Yes, acknowledged flu always get optimal playground flu rates took major hit masking distancing due lower infectious rate compared SarsCoV2. 

They RNA viruses flu mutation rate based smaller genetic code said, much longer experience vaccine design. SarsCoV2 larger genome vaccine predicated spike protein. variant mutates caus conformational change there, likelihood strain significantly resistant vaccine mediated immune response goes up.

You're coming across pretty condescending times. idea intent comprehension fine experience molecular bio/genetics, worked virology labs, hospital labs, PA-C. I'm pessimistic vaccine. hopeful trust last 35% Americans far throw which, given obesity rate, far. deaths mostly lower class oligarchy fine that. 

What back highly effective vaccines. vaccines work work damn well considering huge numbers vulnerable populations vaccinated, there's reason think we'll wind anywhere near saw last year. grown ass adults make choice vaccinate, that's them. US, vaccine widely available, walk Costco, Walgreens, Safeway, Kroger, CVS even without appointment walk vaccinated, cost yourself. 

Infections happen, year, next year, five years now, fifty years now, hundred years now. virus forever. There's running hiding locking way it. time, everyone either infected vaccinated.


The Russian Flu 1890 pandemic believed scientists caused coronavirus. virus believed caused remains us day, presenting common cold. Overall believed cold causing coronaviruses responsible major pandemics first emerged unusual Covid-19 wind following pattern.  
 
In case, grandkids great grandkids would still likely coming COVID-19 infections, decades pandemic subsided. 95 percent effective though. Data Israel abot 63 percent effective delta. could contain unvaccinated bubble effected would one thing undoubtedly effect others around like said.  recently published models (just original Step 4 postponed) based up-to-date vaccine data time. would mean 20-somethings unknown time.

They expect 20-somethings lowest take-up rate, unless 20-somethings given vaccine think vaccine assumptions models particularly unrealistic.  literally 1.2% hospitalization rate *infected* vaccinated people math... thanks finding source back though!

Also, point 1 10 get hospitalized? even arguing now? Lol.

Seriously, go reread comment loud slowly. still getting idea explain understand. would cost nothing post comment. What’s scary even accurate places fear numbers could easily doubled due factors like testing struggles early on. wonder vaccinations natural immunity help prevent long hauler symptoms future. see SARS-CoV-2 would specifically cause long hauler symptoms immune systems reacting strangely novel virus, coronavirus-caused colds seem same. again, I'm doctor, may wrong. tendency anxiety overthinking, odds symptoms entirely caused those.

Edit: Took 4 edits write right amount Os sub.  four fully vaccinated people tested positive virus.

I see stuff like though wonder, symptomatic? require medical care, hospitalization? answer later part question no, welcome future, Covid always circulate small # people die vast majority (and vast, vast majority fully vaccinated people) live worry masks, distancing, etc. think biggest problem group experts giving advice government consists medical experts only.

RIVM literally said care protecting weak, protecting capacity hospitals. weak vaccinated mostly, rising infections probably won’t put hospitals risk it’s younger people getting ill.

The RIVM doesn’t care fucks holidays everyone NL pushes night clubs festival organizers even deeper shit. knew right CDC blasted need masks anymore vaccinated. Well, somewhat true... everyone part, nope. We're getting deep round 2 now. Pffft. Virginia went back wearing mask public felony July 1st.  governor promised police would use discretion enforcing though. 

Begin sarcastic sadly believable take. 

“If you’re white still wear mask public worries gives police yet another reason stop young black males questioning wearing mask.” right, fair UK done excellent job vaccine roll despite Heath Minister thinking little head rather big head. said, Long Covid concern long lasting effects people’s health even get handle virus. Also, UK managing stabilise hospital admissions now. However coming months infection rate going explode doubt variants come along. Meanwhile may lot people sick work feeling ill rather dying Covid. This. making insane Los Angeles experiencing problem. 99.96% new cases unvaccinated    marginal reduction. massive 20 fold reduction. also can't believe it. spent freaking *year* getting people observe kind minimal precautions, somehow pissed away couple weeks.

Now everyone spending evening bars strutting around proclaiming never wear mask again.   Reddit moment rotation known Europe much known certain fields needed left fallow year weed crops we're three-fields systems literally modes crop rotation. like Indians better knowledge soil chemistry, reason blame Europeans ""just knowing leave alone"". two three fields system describes exactly fallow field rotation mentioned. understand trying prove also ""three sisters"" method planting corn, beans squash grown side side permaculture, kept soil productive still providing complete one, method also work kind mechanization (plowing domesticated animals included), dead-end large-scale agriculture. 


Plow field, plant bean corn bean squash, bean corn bean squash. works fine mechanized planting, mechanized harvesting. used animals North America have, fertilized domesticated used them. America llamas used moving burdens quite time 

Small parts Andes llamas. widespread. They're particularly great food animals, beasts burden, dogs significantly insist mentioning potato little NA). 

Potatoes grown around North need didn't, overall development agriculture went way. Looks like low population density


Before introduction smallpox, several native American cities, ones size European cities, thrived. Low pop density, order bringing here, feature American life Europeans (in case unwittingly) fucked up. high yield cultures helps need stuff. 


Wait, wait, wait. realize validated entire argument? Native Americans better crop yields basically entire agriculture argument right there. Americans using cover crops Europeans showed up. know sure long before, really nice get good source it. one, growing beans cover crops growing beans part ""three sisters"" looks strange. 


I'm hard time finding primary scholarly source one. 

In certain climates, varieties beans grow fall winter corn not, growing potatoes soil left depleted end season, two good reasons rotate beans native American garden. Wild apples small sour. 


Some, yeah. Europeans cross breeding apples part. eating little sour ones they're still food. olives nowhere near one get shop nowadays. 


They're smaller, yeah. differences wild (and domesticated) olives get store matter processing olive chemicals. wheat looses grains easily, domestication included making sturdier, end half harvest left field (people literally fight way plants itself). 


That's really difference, though, easiest trait accidentally breed out. straight poison native Americans fixed remember correctly, tubers wild potato relatively edible even consumed raw (and sure - properly cooked), ""a deadly plant turned miraculous food"". good reason tuber part consume nowadays. remember correctly. Wild potatoes extremely bitter, small, must processed clay order eat them. think people ever domesticated something really poisonous eat go ahead add tomatoes list plants wrong then. Either already least partially edible, domesticated needs found good eat it. all, green part potato (the poisonous one wild) still used much. hope understand listed domesticated species (just less optimized), bulgur even grain - dish made wheat. 


Okay. boats particularly important them. were, amazing things, part build permanent structures need boats go beyond couple miles prehistoric people - maybe. even means Ancient Egypt Babilonia really impressive. pretty normal Neolithic people. 


Look Pueblo dwellings. also says lot level trade travel use boats much access huge waterways. 

Trade conducted along waterways, bro. I'm sure point is. European north America know shit? doctor major cities? bounced academics philosophers, incredibly book used training doctors. yes, chances good. germ theory, ""someone knows supports it"" ""have idea"" Europe clean winner. 


Very, few. admitted much yourself. one gibberish. Monks openly practicing herbalism centuries burned no, monks practice herbalism accessible society. Folk medicine punished much survived modern times? Europe medical universities hundreds years time Columbus!

That's barbers trained drain people's blood balance 17th century botany integral part medical knowledge! 


Well contact native Americans well humor theory fell knowledge constantly expanding based European contacts worldwide brought - one, treatment malaria (an Old World disease) found Peru said 17th century trained European apothecary. *The Anatomy Lesson Dr. Nicolaes Tulp* 17th century picture (which, way, done technical level impossible culture NA time. Yet another thing Europe millennia ahead).

I'm sure point here. Wow think dumber analogy could exist yet are.   Ah yes daily repost story. live society decisions affect innocent people vaccinated. People taking responsibility themselves, that's issue, issue ability anyone think beyond themselves. disgusting. ban spectators affected Fukushima’s decision, Uchibori said. “It changed premise organisers’ plans hold matches spectators areas Tokyo surrounding said change plans limited crowds Miyagi, Shizuoka Ibaraki prefectures.   I'm used point lmao, I'll let take shot. say need something like 80~90% population vaccinated, right ? I'll 20~10% There's mass exodus nurses happening. hospital short 40 nurses. small hospital, 200 beds. function beyond me. know fact hospitals can't handle even small surge. NJ haha time start hoarding level 4 biocontainment suits, they'll worth bitcoin months. send link mod they'll unlock it. Happens sometimes. That’s adults. whole population full less half partial half. Delta longer 100%.  applicable.

You told efficacy Delta overall. J&amp;J lower Delta efficacy mRNA. past 6 months I've probably paid $2,500 meds pocket, insurance. insurance $400/month me. paid $2,400 SO's dentures, insurance. thought seizure couple weeks ago begged take hospital afraid expense. gotten bill yet scans done it'll probably cost several thousand, payment plan. 29 31, reference. people go without rather incurring expenses. would disabled without meds much choice. like shoot gun passers cool, died far. respect choices? fucking idiotic. means reproduction number Delta variant around 7.
So 85% population need immune spread stop. Quite ambitious target!  I'm trolling, absolutely serious. But, said took vaccine masks (that still supposed wear btw), covid ? proved point, care health. Next time pandemic, put fork end lockdown  vaccine help stay hospital... help actually immune contagious person? Like may help reduce key factors virus...but like actually savior like imagining. Especially 158M people who've vaccinated get doses 6 months. Also creator mRNA vaccines get silenced concerns vaccine would agree good, humans actually cannot even weigh information, nothing. Barely anyone got H1N1 vaccine comparison one like FUCKING TAKE FUCKING IDIOT EVEN THINK!!!   Yes! Please take necessary precaution. last week there's Singaporean got serious condition powerlifting 6 days vaccination. still investigation atm! That’s accurate. Israeli small study come lot scrutiny. Well there's two ways reaching herd immunity guess. US citizen, shit lots countries - even Russia. we've decades. 

Not saying right all, there's least little context. ever would thought free online social media platforms would easiest cheapest way countries affect democracy. know. point large increase infections. people us fully vaccinated. percentage 48 percent. 55 percent us partially vaccinated. looking 18+ statistics. Yeah, it’s also important remember small percentage myocarditis vaccination. Since sometimes asymptomatic, caution probably good choice. 

Even without myocarditis, it’s probably best hold heavy exercise body trying make strong immune response. microscopic muscle tears lifting, means body work harder repair time trying make antibody memory cells. Except northern communities places like Saskatchewan. right  ? talking about.    FDA allowed arbitrary amounts toxic unidentified materials ""approved"" items before. Sometimes heavy metals (like lead), widely used items like makeup. I'm saying they're useless, saying FDA approval mean much sometimes. personally hinge choice getting life-saving vaccine waiting approve it. Yeah simple, sorry. certainly wrong, ultimate potential mutation unlimited necessarily. 

Flu mutate something drastically different, updated vaccine fairly effective yearly, around long, long time. Much longer Covid. 

I think pointing flu situation enough maybe I'm overestimating comprehension. fear EUA may ever authorized TBH, see post above. Death health outcome covid tho. Also, checks death toll, well shit, big one tho. Also, mutations. way countries low vaccination rates keep deaths health safety countermeasures.

This could work Florida. Plus everyone suffer long haul symptoms joke either. See posts worries EUA approval, too. would recommend go hospital look bodies, new york city problem people saying you’re saying.

This going repeat new york city situation completely supposed 100% effective hospitalizations?  perfect time observation. I'm tired trying save people want saved. likely contract Myocarditis/Pericarditis (inflammation heart) vaccine, die covid

Ah yes! Comparing oranges apples. Dying way worst getting Myocarditis/Pericarditis. sorts ""able think research companies jumping fire blindly"" 

But whatevs lol said husband last night ( listening anti vaxxers accidentally stumbled upon), cannot believe ill head I’ve wished people whole thing kinda don’t feel bad. thing wanting ECDC change color coding based hospitalizations ridiculous lol. like patients hospitals coming across borders infect everyone. course hospitalizations low 10.000 cases day still poses huge risk countries lower vaccination rates Get vaccinated next 2 weeks inject sack! you’re wrong. It’s black white, it’s game percentages. much, much less likely catch spread covid vaccine without one. It’s reducing risk.

How far pandemic people don’t understand shit? didn’t think you’re right Fauci said 99% hospitalizations unvaccinated, actually like 1 100. prescription medication costs around $18,000/month. one actually pays that, insurance absolutely does. People pay several thousand. people go without can't get covered. several charitable organizations help cost. 

I paid $400 medication last weekend.

Even good insurance, costs several hundred month, prescription $10 super low. baby meds recently he's sick think pay $100/month. I'll keep mask get long hauler numbers it. here. Got zero fucks give. That's first-world country would approach it.  Enter anti vaxxers using “proof” vaccines useless. Lol
 0.3% dying make difference.

You need Thanos snap make visible difference shitshow. vaccine runs get full tilt 

Pfizer already said think boosters needed government disagreed probably cause mass panic tank economy. never get this. new cold 100 times worse. No, know extent mutations. limits unknown. mutate super virus kills everyone? keep mutating small changes make huge difference. viruses limits drastically mutate original. 

It black white. People need cool downvotes humble themselves. know everything. certainly know everything yet. responsible member society. not. Bad bot. still spread regardless vaccination, hence ever increasing cases going hand ever increasing vaccinations. Cases never issue, protecting NHS hospitalisations rising anywhere close prior rate vaccinations work.

Which means, need passport would still spread Covid regardless 2 doses, 1 dose doses We've got multiple variants multiple continents year. rate mutation leading actual conformational changes relatively high. way mutation works body starts developing immune response replication virus intracellularly evolves wide spread nonspecific specific antibodies arise. Repeat several thousand times low vaccination rate population propensity symptomatic patients (FL God's waiting room US) likelihood external population intrusion (big travel area super popular antivaxxers year due Governor response masking distancing) optimal evolutionary mutation ground rapidly spreading virus.

Thanks coming TED talk. nice day. people going die covid tho.  Biden can't mandate masks states Yeah know doctor diagnose it, people popping thread wonder  That's CFR. IFR 0.6% ages 50-64, 0.05% ages 18-49, 0.002% ages  Fair enough. overall perspective, would better booster shots send doses developing countries. Later on, boosters probably reserved somewhat immunocompromised old.  know Russia it’s allies lot gain destabilizing West. think US divide could explained accurately saying pro-liberalism vs anti-liberalism divide. problems combating fundamentals liberal democracy. plurality ideas, beliefs, cultures thrive place? people limit freedom good whole society? see US failing many tests own, especially meddling bad actors like Russia like said.  know Russia it’s allies lot gain destabilizing West. think US divide could explained accurately saying pro-liberalism vs anti-liberalism divide. problems combating fundamentals liberal democracy. plurality ideas, beliefs, cultures thrive place? people limit freedom good whole society? see US failing many tests own, especially meddling bad actors like Russia like said.   way crisis people learned live covid - work home, vaccine, items ordered delivery mostly, partial lockdows places.

…  used funny aliens shit kill millions, things get serious trolls need go back bridges figure things out. mean, isn’t surprising all. Yesterday went local steakhouse could hear people table next talking “them implant chips vaccine”. Gotta love Florida, full paranoid, yet, ignorant masses.  Probably long time ever. There’s little incentive vaccinate animals COVID mink don’t spread well humans catch symptoms mild. Wtf talking about. Inactivated vaccines totally different technology mRNA adenovirus vector vaccines. happy scientist developed many different vaccines fast. Probably long time ever. There’s little incentive vaccinate animals COVID mink don’t spread well humans catch symptoms mild. epidemiology would tell viruses mutate, may contagious, actually weaken virulence.

On average maybe, due evolutionary pressure. necessarily every case.   models also thought people would getting vaccines are, still cause lots illness, lots people work, much greater chance mutation. Georgians would like see one fewer inflammation cases. potentially save life. Studies done apparently risk reinfections higher vaccines improve response Delta, even previously infected people. things way worse Florida? 

I live Netherlands made dumb calls cases surged 500 10k matter days. Florida arguably lower vaccination rate Netherlands… Vaccines prevent infection ~90% time. vaccinated get it.

However, match 94% vaccine N95 respirator, back well 99%. teacher LA. 98% Hispanic school, Hispanic myself. repeatedly told parents vaccinated along whole family, none us severe side effects. Told could help get appointments vaccines (back needed one, one does), takers. I’ve students couple years know parents well, confided afraid take would still since family members gotten it, couldn’t get vaccination sites none nearby. told showed TURNED AWAY ID expired couldn’t renew DMV and/or Mexican Consulate (where many able get Mexican IDs, accepted ID many places L.A.) were/are backlogged. couldn’t believe told turned away. begged parents go back ask speak supervisor see exception could made, course wouldn’t go, they’re scared to—even country legally. people it’s never easy show site get vaccine, even though they’re widely accessible. elaborate? immune different vaccinated ? different viruses vaccines? PHE actually say Delta variant likely(roughly 2x) cause hospitalisation Alpha. question still valid thankfully you’re open admitting new facts. 

I horrified probably first saw numbers Israelis. reports consistent. New variants might change hopefully get booster well. anxiety doesn’t sound totally unfounded since anecdotal experiences. said, I’ll pretty shocked things reversed course. live one liberal cities country recently reopened. There’s appetite things go back except small minority. 

Lots country struggled maintain restrictions even things bad. point vaccines there’s reason things roll back. Beyond approving vaccines kids there’s much left point. COVID ain’t going away, vaccine protects damn well severe disease, vaccinated move unvaccinated need keep protecting via masks/distancing care to. Florida still exceeding excess deaths, state way like 5 months, even CA excess death threshold time  
    
SELECT ""excess deaths without covid""  
then toggle states list Moved well, best decision life. Yep! Federal crime far know  something unique Covid vaccines. Myocarditis also rare occurrence vaccines well.  believe it, mom's family there, would get literally phone call day. pure horror even people abroad families India. Completely helpless dark. Lost six family members two weeks Covid India. One uncle's get ambulance eight hours, unbearable heat decomposing body children grandchildren room. Finally, got rickshaw put body roof take straight crematorium. That's one insane story. entire family still mess it. also taught pilots. different. confirmed get shot Olympics. case, might reason maybe possible consequences shot.

But must extreme care order get infected said games, that, get shot soon can. worked contact tracer last summer fall I'm familiar human nature subject think we'll get ""everyone safe"" point. Also hospitalizations deaths always tend somewhat delayed initial case onset. we'll see real effects 10k cases week two. I’ve Myocarditis, it’s little bit chest pain…it like heart attack. Put hospital couple weeks damaged left ventricle. 17, previously healthy underlying medical conditions. Got strep throat. 
If myocarditis, trust me, you’d know! No.

What happens want mandate vaccines.

Should chicken pox vaccine mandatory?

My kids taken vaccine. not. 

I anti vax means. 40 caught chicken pox 7.

I already covid recovered. Pre 2020 science says I'm good go.

It’s gloom doom. Many people report good experiences well bad ones. Precisely.

The reasoning process politicians seems deffective.

Free PS5 young person vaccinates... would solve issue quickly. Funny. alright. good night. Dutch government: *surprised Pikachu face meme* Thanks! No, unfortunately true. huge increase positive tests coming regular ggd testing facilities people testing symptoms. positivity rate jumped 5% nearly 15% past week. Testen voor Toegang tests came back overwhelmingly negative marginally contributed new cases. example, 8,000 new cases week preceding past Tuesday, around 600 TvT. thinks it’s person butt hurt one person moved Florida.  know much though people seem laks.. however spell that. care..

Isn't ironic? PCR test

Rapid test, PCR, rest statement holds true. can't believe many unvaccinated. Young people want lose two summers lives due virus little chance dying from. trust sites like National initially claimed fired role dashboard manager refusal alter state’s COVID data protect reputation DeSantis administration, public records obtained National Review‘s Charles Cooke show never access raw data first place — fact fired repeated performance failures insubordination. ""

From Tampa Bay Times

“Jones ask receive permission share case line level data,” Blackmore explained statement — despite frequent emails discussing published data Blackmore others copied, recent dated three days accused publishing “unauthorized” people wonder others say ""Republicans fall stupid lies!"" agree, frustrating fellow J&amp;J recipient. good news you, J&amp;J announced new data recently shows actually efficacious Delta against, example, South Africa variant. Google find articles it. J&amp;J, excellent protection Delta variant! People wanna around people. Especially distant long.

Personally care. I'll say people time, lived alone, stress relationship/breakups, incredibly refreshing able around people like that. Vaccine body armor fence. 

The fence likely keep first case get full vaccination. 

But offer 93% protection hospitalization death. It'll ratchet severity would otherwise. China idea talking about. /s trust Pfizer CDC federal apparatus even comes anything might considered ""bad news.""

""We're page"" damage control. said I'm doctor, idea. probably fine get 3 shots opinion always better wait experts opinion, case Yep top Europeans already exported 425 Millions doses worldwide. basically fucked might locked places closed months? that's absurd. told last year behind couple look like real problem prioritized vulnerable less 1/3 Cowards don’t well military 

Have good night naive way thinking. Sure people take personal responsibility, however lot people simply care covid. care? Probably extremely naive government expect people care enough people like party. never said did. certain places are/were trending direction. There’s lot arbitrary rules passed people aren’t elected. 

All said it’s valid discussion makes people uncomfortable. also said I’m opposed mitigation measures. everything limit  serious heart condition doesn’t. I’ve struggled years get rid heart syncope problems. use literally faint time huge problem cause massive head injuries life long. got medication around 7 years ago fainted since.

My doctors trying figure started fainting January. Got call hospital today asking come testing reason believe vaccination caused relapse condition. also contact Pfizer it.

Im terrified now. scary time life I’m worried it’s coming back. serious heart condition doesn’t. I’ve struggled years get rid heart syncope problems. use literally faint time huge problem cause massive head injuries life long. got medication around 7 years ago fainted since. 

My doctors trying figure started fainting January. Got call hospital today asking come testing reason believe vaccination caused relapse condition. also contact Pfizer it. 

Im terrified now. scary time life I’m worried it’s coming back.  Curious think risks (were)? Bars great place watch match  mentioned back March vaccinations said sure going get it. guess girlfriend would break fairly good motivator it.

Although planning moving Malta they're allowing unvaccinated people in, guess she'll tough luck. every single time things went really bad easing restrictions (too much early, dumb conclusions obviously wrong) others could see coming, experts don’t!? WTF!? Who's narrative that? I'm personally saying people ignore fact COVID negatively affects person beyond death hospitalized.

If given choice follow simple rules like wearing mask enough people vaccinated, I'll absolutely choose rather risk long COVID losing sense lose QoL enough reason bankrupt nations?

Countries dealt pandemics quicker also economies recover earlier. China's best example major economy grow children youth?

Again, countries took stricter measures sooner also tendency re-open schools loved ones funeral?

My friend lost mom 2 months allowed physically say goodbye. happened people could following recommendations. yes, fuck anyone still complains wear mask follow social distancing, especially said person also refuses get vaccinated. Selfish Graduation ceremony?

Refer above. things could happened sooner people followed simple rules early live hide inside till over.

Based numbers we've seen countries, ~1000-1500 people deal long term effects COVID. hope worth them. Like said, people really take healthy hope respect others choice too

Why would respect choice risk one's health someone else's too?  Henry Ford significant amount hasn't. cases soar 100.000 per day (10x previous peak, unthinkable two weeks) still lot people end hospital. son turns 12 October... Can't wait get shot. 14 year old daughter got first day eligible.

I support use muddle finger ""Here's why"" banned titles. 

I mean subreddit articles public health, mean general. happening everywhere. Long distance race; lose steam right finish line.  So, big thing remember children typically screened heart inflammation. rarely hear cases unless child dies, normally result sudden death playing sports. However, heart inflammation may show visible signs less active child.

No known health issues none. possible need step screenings heart issues even aside vaccine. people showing heart issues vaccination, imagine unknown issue, could make worse. possible prevent vaccination issues children simple slightly intense usual check ahead time. Oh, join military? I'm go maskless wedding, safe I've fully vaccinated Moderna awhile? risk blood clots AstraZeneca shot higher first second dose? remember downvoted almost year talking variants here, starting March 2020. worst ""I told so"" ever worst vindication ever. one number variants arise / already there, we'll deal with. incubators vaccinated still big problem Yes, do. would difficult first several years kids young, think it'll worth able expose outdoor opportunities TX. Plus empty nesters, we're already living place want in. Raising small children long time window, usually.  300 much  2/3 country mean age 0-100 ?

most ppl age 40 2 doses ... rookie numbers 🇬🇧 already vaccinated 17.5 million times though, close population Netherlands (i don’t know many first/second doses though) well 300 children entire US died Covid last 16 months. Thats tiny tiny number. last three points fall official policy “Do Germany week later.”   worth noting Walvax-Abogen vaccine closer CureVac vaccine Pfizer Moderna vaccines though nucleoside-modified uses smaller dose. I'm assuming US? Spain overtaken US terms first doses percentage population 2% behind fully vaccinated folks almost slowdown .

The strategy come age brackets strictly vaccine uptake really high, 80 plus age group 99% uptake 70-79 97.2% uptake. Uptake trend age group high 90s. Data taken (It's Spanish, sorry!). dare say world heavily inspired American culture/celebrities/influencers see American going back normality (e.g. fully unmasked concert crowds) unconsciously believe go back normality well (except vaccines) Reddit peeps hate make sense question way thinking. Good luck you. You’ll get 💪  Part impatience people stupid taking seriously. Like, ok, I’ve done part, I’m willing wait you. actually pretty simple. nothing mRNA covid virus already do.

When get covid (or virus) hijacks cells process viral RNA viral DNA instead own. unlike vaccine controlled dose, virus totally uncontrolled replicates body.

When evaluating safety profile vaccine (for long term effects said) baseline need compare covid. already know covid significantly long term side effects. Superspreader events delta. Well obvious think flawed.

But flawed ability introspection critical thought.

And note, interest, offered argument assertion. mere denial. sir, genius! work hotel industry it’s shocking quickly things turned around since early May, especially weekends. One hotels would typically run rates $89-$109 range since May we’ve running weekend rates $159+ range due demand. we’re left wondering long hold reverts back prepandemic levels. better look 7 day average avoid outliers. June 20th cases may low June 19 7,572 June 21 15,839. picking June 20 specifically gives misleading view. 7 day average June 20 11,134 compared currently 18,272. indeed rise quite dramatic 4,000 35,000 sir, genius! curiosity, bother really good friend opposite mentality important topic? sure? influence stock market one tweet. sure one cares says? ...and according CDC: ""Vaccinated people 'safe' delta pretty irritated CDC director continues go TV spread fake message people get sick chance severe illness getting vaccinated. understand want people vaccinated want give reasons to, know many vaccinated people think 100% fine hearing ""safe"" news. quite clear others familiar part country government workers sent homes people going feel attacked someone's going get shot. 

And set back efforts convince people voluntarily. feel attacked, going double down. better expected news.

""according two infectious disease experts University Alabama Birmingham""

Why would trust anything state lowest vaccination rate highest poverty rate entire US ? Pretty scared rn, doctor’s appointment that’s important don’t think skip it, Tuesday, country (one first world countries infection rates similar USA, Germany, France etc - low still there) able get vaccine. worried. know wear N95 I’m long chances infection low but... I’m still worried. Facts don’t matter people. Reddit bought lie righteous crusader hack nothing going change minds. think that's true. People want story want someone blame. Shouting storm like Lear cut it. little less total population, 66%, Pittsburgh. county population 1M. agree completely last paragraph, even arguing about? Jersey. don’t wanna throw caution wind say covid’s concern here, many folks vaccinated lower case death numbers reflect it. can’t picture state it’s larger threat, it’s surreal. I'll like kid get it. then, people's selfishness putting family risk. one cares Elon Musk say. agree statement part, thing I'm worried thar really pressure virus mutate become milder. almost always happens though simply people walking around spreading feel fine virus spread further. virus spreads asymptomatically large portion people pre-symptomatically rest selective pressure virus mutate become milder already spreading efficiently. pressure continue mutate become efficient infecting host infecting people previously infected. severity resulting mutations coin flip. think that's seeing strains actually severe moment. thoughts anyway. think people somehow less afraid virus created humans, implies control. Accepting virus came wild animals progressively “improving” it’s genome spread around world largely unchecked, terrifying could happen time probably will.  Let's clear. numbers, even though admit made up, extremely inaccurate. Unvaccinated people age 50 &lt;1% chance hospitalization. Vaccinated people see percentage reduced 85% (so &lt;0.1%). Nothing ever sure science. That’s point. Yeah guess there’s contradictory information waning immunity. Seems premature assume drop effectiveness Israel due declining effectiveness. I’m pretty sure Israel’s figures include asymptomatic cases, original efficacy numbers didn’t.

Either way, we’re talking third dose shot, tweaked one delta (yet). Florida mid pack country vaccinations per capita also mid pack deaths per capita. Quit making stuff up. facts don’t fit narrative, people create “facts” thin air it’s gotten old. Well actually true we're pedantic. Look English Sweating Sickness. that's great chart, realize existed like that.  Maybe mandated vaccines ? Also enforce vaccine passports, seemed like brainer time. people brains spreading new variant. it’s okay, didn’t want hurt feelings stomp freedoms. Fucking assholes. not? Japan tests 50,000 people day, nationally. Tokyo tests 8,000 people day average. lot infected people Tokyo rest Japan tested. Yeah guess there’s contradictory information waning immunity. Seems premature assume drop effectiveness Israel due declining effectiveness. I’m pretty sure Israel’s figures include asymptomatic cases, original efficacy numbers didn’t.

Either way, we’re talking third dose shot, tweaked one delta (yet). Yeah waited recommended time first second Apparently don’t know many evangelicals.

Source: entire family(both sides) except brother That’s obvious all. You’re confusing movies reality. full reopening. still come. still restrictions place. (And course even restrictions) Give rest already significantly sure. Maybe tiny bit higher even data argue that. time first second shot matters too.   Congratulations. found large child adopt. they're stilling lying total numbers pulling reporting 'non-resident infections'. Regardless validity that, done cases month ago higher cases now, eliminating non-resident cases manufacture decline. see data here:

Covid:  

Excess:  think point he's making measures taken deal Covid also reduced deaths things. example, masks social distancing respiratory illnesses reduced. lot deaths Covid, fewer things normal, excess actually Covid total.

This case everywhere, seems UK. CDC covering another policy screwup. bad optics say nobody needs masks anymore time admitting vaccine efficacy enough keep vaccinated people getting infected large numbers come fall. Unfortunately, things trending towards direction. According scientists, possible, even guaranteed, we'll putting masks coming winter. Partly due seasonality, partly due variants. CFR pushed vaccines effective treatments, that’s likely overestimate. baseline number people contract slightly higher. Slightly. think remember correctly, like 250 cases baseline. one previous comments arguing anti vaxxer. sheer number people jabbed, infinitesimal.  knew rules, still it, accept consequences. What’s worst he’ll do, sue? worth risk? huge drop. one example 2% chance drops 0,18% experts mean I’m reading multiple articles hearing podcasts epidemiologists virologists immunologists vaccine specialists. article linked post! Combining mRNA vaccine adenovirus vaccine boost immune response might “official” US guideline, scientific community building consensus toward. Kind worrying many people knowingly reject data want outbreak over. isn't. vaccination rate country 75%+

Total population? Congratulations, might enough curtail delta. btw? Iceland? Malta?

If 75% adult population, might enough variant agressive reproduction. hope is.

And ever continuing quaratine, within know particular riskfactors (own health. contact transplantees, people HIV positive, people particularly risk) risk do. deliberately moved CO TX years ago. friends family ask think we'll move back. Never happening.  United fruit. symptoms been? significantly sure. Maybe tiny bit higher even data argue that. It’s same. vaccinated people drastically reduces risk infection transmission within group. That’s good point. still careful go/what since niece stay week month. She’s currently undergoing cancer treatment. parents whatever want covid covid. Tbh generation talking imho least efficiënt generation ever had, never contributed alot society, tiktokked day partied night long. vector vaccine - one first ones, actually. CanSino Convidencia - single-shot Ad5 vector vaccine. Fuck governments. 

The US destabilizing foreign countries voted “wrong” way generations.  high school principal I've seen TONS studies show masks schools much. little proven spread American schools general masks not. Source? sounds made 

It's vaguely true reference viruses extremely high mortality rate kill quickly. sounds like someone picked bit knowledge, realize true one set circumstances.

A virus own. reproduces makes mistakes that. mistakes make deadlier. mistakes make spread faster slower. mistakes make onset disease come sooner faster.

From evolutionary standpoint, variants survive simply ones capable continued reproduction. ones become dominant ones better reproducing staying population.

What individual referring paradox virus needs host live long enough survive pass else evolutionary dead end. virus Ebola deadly progresses quickly killing host can't spread effectively. Ebola burns areas kills quickly.

So yes, Ebola actually break onto world scene, would probably evolved less deadly. would make effective reproducing spreading.

But that's true viruses. viruses deadly kill hosts spreading. There's wide middle range virus quite deadly, coronavirus is, without damaging ability reproduce.

There's also ton factors affect spread virus. invention successful treatment, HIV near 100% mortality rate. However, stayed dormant years symptoms started appear. plenty time spread hosts, mutate become less deadly. need to. version Ebola 30-day window onset disease symptoms could spread much farther without one whit less deadly.

Another factor virus transmitted. Ebola, thankfully, transmitted bodily fluids. vastly limits transmission. airborne variant Ebola would spread much faster. However, could still probably contained easily due easy symptoms spot.

Covid airborne asymptomatic large portions population. There's evolutionary pressure become less deadly, could probably become great deal deadly without remotely hindering ability reproduce. person responding simply wrong. Considering we’re already seeing that, venues filled, flights oversold, hotels filled, it’s almost guaranteed trend holding back pre-pandemic. Cool, Florida one fastest growing states country, you’re oddball there. rules probably Euro Championship? think need Voters Unions, pool votes together issues agree able use force politicians what's interests moneyed backers. whole load Max Verstappen fans Austria Grand Prix wonder that's got something it? Chilean study Gamma &amp; Lambda strains actually vaccination campaign (and study) started February that's strains started rising there. That's difference Turkey &amp; Chile studies. Rutte Doctrine. Spoken like true anarchist. Rutte Doctrine. billion vectored vaccines yet? vaccine, 6 people 100 hospitalized lets say. (Number assumption)

without vaccines, 80 people 100 hospitalized. health care system collapses. mutations come. 

The math quite simple think that's news media emphasize. 

""Texas man vaccinated, contracts Delta variant, hospitalized"" title raw manipulative considering existing vaccine hesitancy. key. seem ignore important age data.

Why young people walking around like doesn’t matter.. doesn’t.

After year careful … old people vaccinated… anyone left older population unvaccinated victim poor education choices.

Data second far scarce, probably somewhere 30 60 percent. So, like, honestly anyone see smth wrong titles like literally r/coronavirus ? means UK high risk decision? AI right every time tries take can't take care ourselves. ""the vax doesnt work get somehow work!"" own. biggest issues Texas (besides state politics) weather. hot humid me. also hurricanes. I'll take week-long blizzard Hurricane Harvey again. Also, grid infastructure pretty bad. lost power times four years Texas ever entire life point combined. traffic major cities Texas insane. think cities designed around cars sprawling suburbs would figured traffic, no. 

That state's me. Simple that. LOL, entire province Alberta reported 52 cases day vaccination rates better NL (NL 38% people 2 doses, AB 51%).  Also huge chunks Stampede **outdoors**, whereas NL spike came bars/clubs/etc. They'll fine - relax. find really stupid get surprised every time something like happens. Either decision live thing, accept high cases while, live it, permanent solution required. Otherwise back forth another year, least. go Sounds like getting vax pointless. Wash hands, stop licking public doorknobs toilet seats, stop kissing strangers, stop inhaling peoples coughs mouths, get fine. appreciate concern everyone one protesting gov. ok. promise. Oh sure.. I'll trade heart potential protection body could done itself... 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Symptoms one thing, physiological symptoms measured labs imaging duration concern. Runny nose - cares. Heart inflammation, blood clotting, lung damage (all common asymptomatic/mild/moderate cases) metrics I’m interested in.

Totally agree PCR - also surprisingly high false negative rate SARS-CoV-2

These show 9 30% false negative rate know generalization fallacy, right? ask worried doctors giving microchip.  Blood tests? Gave blood? heard even putting chips standard tylenol prescription drugs. 

Chips water. Chips 5g. Chips CHIPS. 

Its FUCKIN CHIPS MAN. THATS SHORTAGE.

Its hilarious watching think I'M crazy then.

These people afraid doctors never go now. 4 matches Bucharest 30-50 cases per day. Hungary that, 5 matches limit capacity. explain that? uses data going back September 2020. Delta variant even around then? public's willingness change based credible evidence enough re-enforcement. would also recommendation, mandate.

I share optimism. US cleanly divided point, people gotten vaccinated already, people get matter what.  Yes, 100% effective, takes time activate shots. makes doctors wrong...  Yeah, comment nothing link. vaccine deaths, deaths COVID vaccination. shots 100% effective take time become active.

There next vaccine deaths. rate well 1/1M. anti-vaxxers understand medical terms think reports adverse reactions deaths. IM TALKING YALL!
Some folks don’t even ability work home. Damn.  Im confused majority areas IL rising cases urban areas, mostly downstate midstate counties. Look data brah Neither Pfizer Moderna vaccines contain egg. get sick, lol.

When 2 years ago gf appendicitis Chiang Mai Thailand went there. Official advice case serious injury/emergency 'take plane BKK seek help there'   Florida laughs. wait Florida variant. gonna make dumber.   Damn, almost like people nasty. friends paranoid 
   
but still went karaoke bar? Viruses mutate odd ways vaccines completely lose effectiveness, would undergo crazy mutation leads attach human cells completely different way right now. We've seen easily hundred million infections around world still single known variant defeat current vaccines. 

That feel positive future. vaccines working, time goes on, boosters added vulnerable, biggest issue right getting people vaccinated limit viruses ability spread unchecked.  

Meanwhile there's incentive continued research develop even bulletproof vaccines medical treatments reduce need hospitalizations. drug better Covid-19 vaccines? so, great boon mankind proven drugs yet novel Coronavirus disease. Right now, think, vaccines hold center stage managed hold progress disease India. 
To know vaccines India, read article given below-
[Covid-19 vaccines 283 cases 177 million shots

Not bad odds, doesn’t seem like something worried about. Or…not. 

Yeah I’m thinking not. old, use ratio would indicate around 6.7M. sources coming up, huh? Tricky  Bad boomer confusing right work employment.

At employment means employees fired reason except illegal ones (age, sex, race, religion, pregnancy, etc).  states except Montana will.

Right work means employees can't forced join union workplace (which dramatically weakens power unions).  half states right work. Jusy 64% more, keeps going down. Unvaccinated people actually safer vaccinated ones get negative test attending events traveling.
Vaccinated asyntomatic, take test spread virus lot people (like happened Israel) I'm confused can't wait month two reach good pct people vaccinated? still massive anti-vaxxer / supply issues? 🛎 🛎 🛎! Depends. example, obese, old, generally unhealthy, true. young healthy, actually taking risk getting it. Also mathematical fact. blanket statement true includes suggestion that, that's makes editorialized.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  think either misunderstanding misinterpreting question. 

I said based statement “vaccine boosters needed time”.  upvote truth. need vaccinate 25% consecutive day stay ahead. Stories like prevent boarding flight despite fully vaccinated. can't trust people make ethical choices. pandemic taught anything, people plain selfish; care health wellbeing others, nothing officials say change that. damn shame, feel passengers plane loved ones potentially exposed. hope young people face consequences needless suffering stress irresponsible behavior caused. There's excuse it. Yet, according Fox-obsessed mother, Florida *fantastic* pandemic, despite open, isn’t *something* don’t think know CFRs interpreted. Except course risk 2 orders magnitude smaller.  Sadly true. Idk don’t want responsible killing someone’s parent grandparent wanted party.  seems disconnect 'can't get it' versus 'getting take.' 


Basically everyone *can* get vaccine, immune system *isn't there*, people chemo/with HIV/on immunosuppressive drugs, effective. vaccines-- *and COVID vaccines* \--rely training immune system recognize threat, confers longterm protection. person's immune system can't trained, welp. becomes compounded risk; vulnerable individual already unhealthy, thus prime real estate COVID's summer home, left without ability keep little bastards out. public's willingness change based credible evidence enough re-enforcement. would also recommendation, mandate.

50% growth cases last 14 days. Hospitals central MO collapsing. warnings here. either act repeat last fall/winter, keep damaging nation. they're working new formula cause this? want vaccinate children would good idea since 40. Yikes one tell heart inflamation?? Makes sense.. thx lot people Florida (a largely red/republican/Fox News kinda state) refusing take. Heck, Florida couple months ago virus running rampant, one wearing masks social distancing all. Florida different kind DGAF sometimes. ignorant statement. evangelicals alike. like atheists alike Muslims. 

Anyone really understands means Christian would mindset family has. saying Christians, something up. Going forward, however, death rate much lower — category people far highest rate death (the elderly) also likely vaccinated.

Not saying indifferent Covid spreading— it’s still bad thing, course — least *less bad* previous waves  worst part posts like get lots votes subreddit, anything ""China bad"" really, posts actual information showing Sinovac works intended almost ignored. Meh. rest world needs shut US down. Send humanitarian aid ghettos Bible Belt people live 3rd world conditions sanction US corporations death. Enough trash country messing rest world. looks like death rate covid Oh ok, well you’re fully vaccinated proud won’t problem getting job. Chill cases reported. haven’t trusted Florida’s numbers since began.

I family members Covid wouldn’t get tested “gives power to
the dems.” amazing far cult go together. Well it’s Florida explains lot  haven’t read articles support claim obviously haven’t read everything link source? Oh good point. Thanks. don’t seem like much contribution generation either. Posting reddit day sleeping night… (most, all), say something like ""the government makes numbers"". Consider N95 face shield medical personnel protect dealing known infected Covid patients. understand concern. don’t delay health appointments you’re afraid Covid. Yeah, really need right now. Cases surging 50% last 14 days variant much dangerous.

If case them, is? Several billion people Asia seem think nothing putting mask mere cold, let alone full-blown pandemic. thing mutations bound bad news. mutate perhaps, infectious, innocuous disease. gather even horrific flu strain ravaged world early 1900's still us, lot mild.

Also, vaccines target elements virus virus change much rendered vaccines useless, stands good chance also changing much falls apart.  mostly lost ability feel sorry choose get vaccinated. bother me. genuinely surprised learn covid vaccine. never thought would like this. However, I've known 10 years, we've helped lot years, going break friendship this. I'm trying get her, unsuccessfully, far. Covid-19 vaccines new disease itself. taking vaccine may affect Sexual problems unfounded. 
To know vaccines effects, read article-
[Covid-19 vaccines dang u Lakota ? mean heart attacks   Oh we’re huh city 60 million increasing problem meat shortage people turn unconventional sources. lab isn’t direct evidence such. Nonsense. Covid conspiracy vaccines political media surrounding it. Also surprised bought puppet. Probably are, you.

Now please excuse astrology readings dog cryptos market.  20,000 years this, 7 go!     I'm quite sure trying say. 

The vaccine protects two different ways:

1) direct protection. So, reducing chances compared similarly-situated unvaccinated person 1/20th 1/10th chance compared vaccinated. 

2) reduced community spread virus. people around vaccinated, less virus spreads lower chance even come contact it. big health corporations sadly. can't deny alot money involved rollout vaccines. companies gain lying individual reddit users.

In US FDA main regulator. agency receive atleast 50% funding pharmaceutical companies since 1992 ""precription drug user fee act"". think FDA impartial matter naive say least. safety precautions Florida, though. never enacted mask law. really bad. maybe calling oddball reason. 

Lack self-awareness. go, Reddit! went back two weeks second shot. brain needed it. feel weird first, got used it, I’m okay. probably condons too, HPV Shots many ISTS unvaccinated need denied entry hospital unless show pay bill upfront build wall around Florida one get in/out? Asking grandma People still parroting several deadly strains?  Winter coming issue give warning obese people change lifestyles predicted pandemic 2017. risk exposure entirely behavior.

Your risk symptomatic disease significantly reduced days first dose. little much cocaine  Probably front end new wave. Given vaccines distributed far they'll go unwisely stopped mitigation efforts related vaccination states Delta surge. early tell badly, end summer beginning school year we'll primed another large outbreak, hopefully fewer deaths, it'll depend deadly Delta infected, state risk hospitals, etc. Deniers say lockdown kills people Yes huge chunks **official** stampede outdoors, Nashville North offsite Stampede ragers around downtown? demographics areas attract? really think 51% vs 38% going substantially impart magical shield transmission? Oh, I’m sure think covid measures foolproof well? Like showing proof first dose vaccination going effectively enforced 19 year old security guys rapid tests (which often reliable show false negatives) going keep covid positive folks out? You’re seriously underestimating things going play out. Go ahead downvote me. You’ll eating words month. NYT via google reported 35k new cases Yes girl dont mother him! Red flag one date haahhaha r/femaledatingstrategy

Id literally kill vaccine especially one dose one country guys procrastinating??? Brasil living hell right bc stupid president ohhhh, god painful see get close getting it, blow right past it.

Have upvote. Second world.  Correct, prime example people saying “ can’t assume that…so let’s assume best case scenario”

There isn’t enough data affect vaccinated people. People want inside scenario allows that. I’m waiting data subs followers dropping like rock.

Only crazy people (me) still daily. Children also aren’t compliant correct mask wearing, (partly aren’t *able,* since don’t facial muscle control adults,) masks small children tend end wet, makes basically useless. Masks tiny ones, 6-7, really might completely pointless. big super spreader events mass pilgrimage, cricket vs England, political rallies, coincided within couple weeks. Since then, thankfully similar public events covid far dangerous heart inflammation.  could be, Florida particular banned health precautions public areas. private businesses still require masks it’s pretty much open season here. hope rest nation isn’t bad precautions    testing fake tests....and mostly access test meaningfully health infrastructure. rare? wondering news Black Hispanics vulnerable anyways Wish people would stop coming state take advantage low numbers worked hard achieve. recommended, may change. I'd wait recommendation.

See huge comment links. virus mutates, likely another country Covid spread even worse. US still comprises small proportion global cases point. pulling reporting 'non-resident infections'.

Thanks. Even so, case numbers past several days spiked badly. Laughs Stephen Dubner Steven Levit aware many vaccinated people getting infected uk?

At least tell really story instead spouting shit karma votes. It’s virus that’s evolving bad cold, clearly see new symptom list thing Delta - much symptoms among younger people fifty. one 'safe' wearing mask office going piss anyone off? wear it, job, stop thinking anyone cares vax stance. CFR, IFR, right? everyone infected diagnosed. Good luck making people want 🤣 54% i’ve seen Worry time worry. moved TX red midwest state we’re considering relocating CO job… it’s cost living damn high denver.  worth cost? ""free country"" people right express opinion, even government happens different opinion?

And comes vaccines, assume makers vaccines greater competence government officials. Fact downvoted. go, Reddit! Oh, guess forgot wear mask. someone could prove paper exists lol   primary reason vaccination protect vulnerable save lives. Preventing spread secondary. anyone links studies show outcomes twice-vaccinated people (AstraZeneca) aged 50-60 type 2 diabetes catching Delta variant? 

Wow. That's way specific. one, awesome, wish luck finding it!

If want know Delta treated differently hospitals compared previous variants original virus, well, not. Treatment same, severe symptoms same. housemates might even samples taken sequencing.

Know way better treatment compared beginning pandemic. Like holy cow better. general response people 

You’ve added list people helping solution climate change. name added list people willing remove humanity’s gene pool. List shared hospital staff would ease minds strain medical resources . Thank service. Latest is, delta variant, yet decided:[With Delta variant spreading, experts split whether test vaccinated people Great way making extra money.

First Class? Extra
Bags? Extra
Meals? Extra

Creating ruckus? Extra  100% agree basically everything said. don’t view vaccine (or boosters) magic bullet. 

As parent, I’m trying everything possible give kids best chance possible fighting disease.  chest pain pfizer vax  know meeting discuss 12-17 authorization also looked risk kids, still get spread coronavirus. children vaccinated helps protect community whole. reached high level community immunity could see pushing approval seems creeping back areas, especially Delta variant, see approving Pfizer submits fall. end times 🤣🤣🤣!
Alexa, play “Give wings” crazy. anyone please tell wether Delta deadly?? death rate??? learnt NOTHING failed health measures decisions last year west, vaccine virus could wiped hundreds millions end pandemic. don’t think counting death within month covid counting? guy town fell cracked head open sidewalk. died. covid. counted covid death. comes vaccines, assume makers vaccines greater competence government officials.

Or greater incentive boost stock price selling vaccine $hots. sounds crazy... someone much govt. works. someone tell hierarchy govt.? who's Governor? Lets say Governor becomes crazy decides limit food supply state he/she wants reduce obesity. stop him/her?  it’s required it’s personal choice since Olympics aren’t requiring vaccinations. Dumb know is.  causes death rate go up?  can’t assume covid though. Drug overdoses, suicides, etc soared. Shit lot people died home strokes heart attacks scared go hospital. 


It’s incredibly inaccurate count excess deaths.   reading CDC advice they've caught still isolate rest household recommended period. 

The vaccine highly protective perfect, risk catching COVID quite likely dependent much virus run into.  

If exposure vaccinated person, need isolate unless become symptomatic, still try minimize exposure someone sick shedding virus.   Really? Cause see certain political party constantly claiming Fauci using virus keep people scared. it? downplayed virus, exaggerated virus keep people scared? Yes, do. one government already this. vaccinated attend public school - that's mandate schools enforcement mechanism. Lots places even removing one non-medical opt-out (faith). So, yes, that's exactly I'd prefer another mask mandate. 

Also, I'd ask question, masking prevent waves? believe masking works 100% individual level, proven work societal level US still experienced COVID surges areas almost universal masking compliance. Why? please elaborate.  responsibility go voters elect Masks mandatory indoors 26 June. 1,5 meters still mandatory, practice basically exist either indoors. Go hospital, one wearing mask well. U.S. people don’t want work get vaccinated keep receiving unemployment +$300 welfare checks.  know dick yelling someone never changes mind reinforces POV. that’s part reason think debates stupid unless solely entertainment Holland Euro's 28th June, think England going bigger problem there. Three games people get together watch spread virus. main superspreader events nightclubs, football matches.  think total 500 people baseline like 250, 280 correlated vaccine.   Yeah. I’ve gotten doses. last Wednesday hit 2 week window I’ve fine. Outside initial side effects like arm pain, chills stuff like I’ve dealt nothing all. I’m also 20 year old man.

It’s say people can’t certain bad reactions vaccine, vaccine greatly reduces risk severe version Covid. One friends refuses get vaccine seen video someone metal apparently sticking arm I’m baffled.  wife youtuber South Florida follow suddenly died Jan 30th. suspect COVID picked New Years Eve party held. remission cancer, believed pandemic scare mongering nothing. NY whole 2 per 100k sub really known rational thinking context, important keep mind US literally *tens* thousands gyms, vast majority operating safely without ""outbreaks"".  posting usual parade nonsensical rambling ""unsafe"" gyms begins.......  Quick post food Instagram advanced always-connected pocket computer dozens sensors it.   death rate going ? Yup. NL reopened everything suddenly (US also fully open think). delta also majority cases week earlier US. US overall also fully vaccinated people 2 weeks ago (which matters protection levels delta). exploded here, youth partying everywhere single dose Janssen (basically 0% testing) leaky test system, rest population overall got basically freedoms back, delta became majority, lead mix creating spike.

On hand, levels deaths hospitalisations still extremely low level, believed increase way cases did, explosion cases almost exclusively caused youth, mostly partially vaccinated all. vulnerable people older people seeing huge rise cases almost fully vaccinated. Currently Netherlands sees 1 death &lt;7 hospital admissions per day average last 7 days. almost 10,000 cases population 17.5 million. still pretty good stats. However, cases terrifying atm. Delta+ Lamda…the variant emerged Peru 🤦‍♀️ two variants occurred ~a month half! Ugh. Ah... good point. US, ones likely dead ones would likely vote keep backwards politician office, effect may somewhat self-leveling. May sound harsh speak truth. Many people can’t handle reality  First time clubs bars fully opened apparently lot people faked required corona free test results get in. government also decided Janssen vaccine shot enough go clubbing next day, immunity.

Literally no-one wearing masks anymore worrying distancing (I one ones still wearing mask grocery stores ill continue till weeks get second shot). Working home mostly stopped. underestimation rapidily spreading Delta variant.

Combine general lack wanting follow rules got jackpot going.

If anything pandemic taught go gut even more, instead following general guidelines always seemed 1-4 months behind Reddit :) Also never said believe climate change. quite literally said different, prepublished singular source, agreed upon thing like climate change. gotta better reading comprehension gonna argue might stupid vaccination that's problem. People realize suddenly stop spreading corona vaccinated. stop getting it. Looking data 7 day average get 330 week back 430. 33% increase. June 10th 579, behavior since changed?

I would consider sky high yet, may something keep eye next weeks. 

In county MD entire month June 95% cases unvaccinated people. far data seen around country 90% cases unvaxed individuals. looked seems accurate. Ouch PR control?

Oh boy, they're trying! live Missouri, low vaccination rates (although live St. Louis, higher vaccination rate state across state southwest hotpot). don’t really need worry anything I’m fully vaccinated, right? ctrl + f ""pangolin"",  I’m immunocompromised fully vaccinated. Blood tests shown vaccine probably isn’t effective people normal immune systems. guess means I’ll lockdown rest life. reddit. There's time reading, sharing uninformed opinions. Soooo... Masks work? knew? /s try New York City? Unreal. pretty strongly disagree this. people hospitalized check it’s covid. There’s number professions get tested regularly regardless vaccine status. especially trials would see vaccinated people got sick. vaccinated people getting much we’d know. doctors telling us (people inflammatory responses) guarantee due vaccine. first time seen stat and, like many ""it's fine"" stats, longer believe telling us. will.. already tightened restrictions bit. tbh really lost cause. People morons here. government never lowered restrictions like this. dropped everything expected gonna fine.

But cash money right. needed money start flowing again. Stuff closed = losing money That's one stupid sub rules I've seen... google walvax covid vaccine, plenty links info clinical trials etc Yeah exactly, intelligent idea... Hang there. others, many others. Actually within Europe mentioned two possible contenders really see. looking closely uptake data revise ""bet"" as: 1st Denmark, 2nd Spain, 3rd Portugal, 4th Ireland. 

But mostly following closely European countries perhaps suddenly Singapore (for example) gets ahead everyone... Pretty much age groups Netherlands seem getting there. maybe world, Netherlands, subject discussion 80+% starting look feasible. Nepal, Bangladesh, Malaysia... Yeah, know story. responding gym fearmongering comment. can't use AZ younger people blood-clotting issue. government clever enough (or stingy) diversify vaccine portfolio early contracts/purchases. everyting order now, join end queue.  can't make someone else sick die obesity.

That's vaccine important. use math calculate likely would increase seen chance, unlikely chance. one vaccinated there? Wtf? far know, known cases outdoor transmission infected person spend 5+ minutes close contact whoever got from. behind times? known cases casual outdoor transmission, someone got someone without close significant amount time? Ok. Say, happen read article that's linked top page you? see statistics? know many would died anyway subtract below-expected deaths coming years.

Like NHS data, 92% deaths 60, 55% 80 - vast majority pre-existing conditions (mainly diabetes, dementia heart disease). lot people would died pre-existing conditions within years anyway, result below-average deaths post-COVID years.

[NHS 1st July 2021: 

Age | % PE Condition | % Total Deaths
---|---|----
0-19 | 80.95% | 0.04%
20-39 | 86.33% | 0.71%
40-59 | 90.18% | 7.22%
60-79 | 95.46% | 38.27%
80+ | 97.08% | 54.74% sufficiently protected. Seems perfectly fair, though unfortunate, considered fully vaccinated. far likely contract die covid side effect vaccine. eased restrictions election religious festivals, correct? 99.5% damn compelling.. betting testing around Dumbasses Also az also used half dose protocol.

I wonder drug companies running new trials testing smaller doses. Right mean someone knocks door dont want say thank u move on. still getting emails state get jab even though ignore now. One hand telling hand going on. 
I really dont understand one side making hard. guess math decided enough survive vote them. 
They cutting access guess people want got sick yesterday. Pretty sure it’s COVID. Haven’t tested yet can’t get bed go anywhere. got J&amp;J vax almost 2 months ago. brutal Yup, got first cold last week. made regret taking mask off, reinforced even mild illness still pretty miserable. Pack guys, virologists concluded, true! Wait it.......the tulip strain!!  stories like make glad province really conservative reopening cautiously looking numbers, many peoples dismay.  Flair mean supposed follow rules. comments come across like vaguely threatening user, definitely allowed. flair removed fail follow rules, please follow them. Thank you. You’re getting downvoted agree. I’ve going gym whole time, would lose mind couldn’t work usual. got vaccine months ago schedule too, never worried state puts years county fair week, every one screaming rides, touching… super spreader events Pfizer better time table. gets even better first shot. pick j&amp;j unless choice amazon.com e-commerce website allowed posts comments.

That's remarkable... idea behind policy would beneficial long run get people take vaccine would outweigh extra infections short term. obviously underestimated magnitude short term peak. followed US guidelines without vaccination rate  referring person said didnt wait long enough second shot.  Would recommend chicken pox vaccine older adults exposed virus earlier age?

Would recommend covid vaccine older adults exposed virus last year?    

Again, anti vax. kids date(including chicken pox vax). date. think taking chicken pox vaccine anything. Edit: Removing post basically political. Completely agree dropped mask mandate, curious wear mask outside? Inside spaces people understand, outside? sure getting ""near 10,000 per day"" from. highest 7-day average cases Florida reached ~18,000 January

Thus even January, number people vaccinated near today.

Point taken. I'm addition said, everyone wanted visit event club test 100's thousands people went testing. obviously showed much infections noticed before. Yeah pants head dumb hearing Florida trying count visitors. absolutely is. hospitals max capacity ICU beds big wave. That’s abnormal every illness. fact happened tell something dangerous COVID is. never said January 2021 horrible? 

What saying wrong say July bad (or would ""go back"" January) simply two days (currently) cases 10,000. reason saying this, pointed previous replies, number people vaccinated today nowhere near January 2021. Vaccinations relevant discussion.

The vaccine effective hospitalizations deaths, well provides protection Delta Variant. story verified? forgot get decimal Thanks article. appear two small studies, one 8 20 people. hope conduct studies larger groups. see vaccination rates though horrifying. 30s vax rate 90s peeps wearing masks.  Yep, I'm sick right fever cough, caught daughter week. Last week stopped mask wearing daycares kids sick week common cold, etc.  unvaccinated young wave nearly deadly  Sarcasm eludes real puzzle. People deny polio.  deny swine flu.  

We education. good presidents like Gerald Ford Dwight Eisenhower John Kennedy. way they're role models.

How get deniers stop denying? Even they're threatening lives...  also think might first countries vaccinate 80% total (yes, adult eligible) population.

Iceland Malta maybe others good chance number 1. Lol. Vatican also already.

There little vaccine hesitancy Portugal. rankles bit see Eu countries, theoretically get proportion vaccines Portugal vaccinating 18s 18-25 year olds. 25s even get booking yet, lot 40s getting first shots. still lucky compared rest world though.

And race delta. Let us hope vaccine suppliers fail keep delivering promised. man, wouldn’t upset didn’t put strain healthcare mortuary systems people ones would hurt shit, rather public health employees treat vulnerable people can’t get vaccine reason; mention, longer thing maintains community spread, likely spawn new variants could even worse, vaccine might work well on.

because course, talk big “no big deal” public health measures infringe “dur freedoms,” second actually get sick, first line hospital get treatment 🙄 Less ppl get tested upcomming weeks, since lot tests event/clubs based tests. Today alone 50k test appointments cancelled. Also lot asymptonic ppl got tested positive ones ending hospitals. assume rise hospitals current highest group infected ppl dont end hospital ones mostly vaccinated point ok. vaccines makers claim ... James Bond star - double-vaccinated asymptomatic - appearing four films world's famous movie festival. I'd argue T-cell immunity important, limited examples people can't make antibodies able clear infections killer T-cells. Whoa whoa whoa, *everyone* Florida reckless idiot. Name people responsible, Disney Flu? Cruiseliner sideliner? Delta-Santis variant? you’ve taken vaccine still think risk? take vaccine?

I’m trying troll I’m trying see others point view, I’m struggling see get vaccine moment. Eh Florida may able mandated, mandated things like returning workplaces, hope, returning colleges. Colleges Universities already mandatory vaccine schedules, big stretch add it. would pretty much eliminate surges 18-30 year olds seen right now, least USA. swine flu 2013, although flu times prior, felt like going die. go ER cannot recall feeling bad life. felt annihilated weeks afterward. mind all, I'll find way include tomorrow. freedom? Florida again? place found one guy eating another guy's face?  Oh boy vaccination rate US extremely unlikely hospitals become overloaded It’s chips way down. see single ad. uBlock Origin. Yea go get vaccinated. 

Not sure understood second question. get COVID (possible rare) carry possibly transmit it. unless symptoms know near someone COVID would worry it. family people, know likely willing sever connection difference beliefs. least hurt connection lot stand them. Usually like chance correct beliefs.  
Saying respect beliefs way ruin connection this. Yeah vaccine needles smallest use. 25g think. barely suck liquid them. think sometimes drawing vaccine draw bigger needle switch vaccine needle draw slow. 

You barely get blood sure def get microchip. seen lot posts articles J&amp;J efficacy Delta, data far looks really promising. :) I'm surprised LA County 69% eligible people vaxxed one dose (16+) (for reference, San Francisco 82% 12+), numbers soar LA, LOT places going get hit least hard. like LA anti-vaxxer city like Detroit.  considering blackrock owns majority U.S. media 3rd biggest shareholder Pfizer, think need worry negative news stories hitting mainstream regards vaccines think would.  mortality very, low you’re fully vaccinated, still catch transmit virus. it’s nice still wear it. “When leave individual judgement..”

There’s places world people like politicians rule don’t worry thing. Go Yeah removed gov ernor's name one get deleted. Apparently version name considered political? even get started.

I secretly hoping spiderman superpowers choice, happen either. buying stop US conspiracy theories though. Kent discovered, started. UK like half genetic testing covid strains. really surprise that's found.

But much higher chance mutations forming peaks third world countries, mean cannot happen somewhere else.  “We’re never going zero COVID [cases] United States” - Dr. Scott Gottlieb, Former FDA Commissioner look well instead finding ways justify death

No one justifying death. Since COVID today deadlier swine flu polio, would propose? many 3,380 2 doses vaccines many needed hospitalization?

[Florida longer publish daily coronavirus governor. Tell talk God. wonder Dr. J. C., patron saint ivermectin Youtube, stay horse admit wrong spreading misinformation tens thousands people. elderly disproportionately vaccinated, lethality lower bc risk factors reduced. unfortunately, kids subjected routine weekly testing like sports programs California. at-home test kits like Ellume easy, basically thoughtless disregard attempt covid mitigation. easy blame coaches &amp; gym management, kids' parents support kinds reckless corona-spreading conditions, either care truly think flu.    thinking selective pressure mutation spreading, mutation forming.

A mutation forms simply errors RNA trascriptase (protein builder) turning rna covid new viruses. proofreading good humans (which still perfect). 

The replication occurs, errors form. errors useless harmless, provide benefit. Huge spikes see third world countries, much people can't even access covid test true numbers much higher know, mutation first arises simply due proofreading errors.

Though point apply mutation dodges vaccine-developed antibodies likely means easier time infecting areas higher vaccine rates, running many people immune (and likely taking precautions took back 2020).  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Well spread follows Gaussian distribution. Meaning rises exponentially reaches peak decreases exponentially. far math concerned sort cases flow checks out. claiming data fudging.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   sounds like tales ass, source? Interesting, one major tenets scientific hypothesis falsifiable. take authors word, conclude near impossibility engaged practice science. Called months ago obvious, especially delta appeared, move surprise absolutely one. 

The way get vaccine percentages lower age groups inconvenience people getting fully vaccinated. everyone option getting vaccinated (certain small number exemptions apply) announce date far enough ahead restrictions unvaccinated kick in. 

Want go abroad holiday - fully vaccinated. 
Want eat inside restaurant - fully vaccinated. 
Want drink inside pub - fully vaccinated. 
Want go club, sports event, cinema - fully vaccinated. 
(Or recent test... pay for.) thing is...everyone need get vaccine. Let information presented useful way (I agree article going shock value headline) let everyone make decision based risk assessment. tried one stand alone ERs got turned away. found urgent care would call nebulizer medication. Probably good got turned away though, US, would blown charged like 20k. insurance $300 ER copay, plus $5000 deductible pay 20%. Agree 100%. Currently 10 day quarantine arriving amber country. called every day NHS track trace, taking 3 tests total ( expensive) , taking 10 days work ( I'm nhs nurse work need ) losing income. one guy come door asking passport missed one phone calls. Oh kicker already covid year ago 2 doses vaccine already. really see face restrictions anti vaxxer refuses wear mask buys exemption card eBay. Nothing *entirely* dismissed. science works.

They dont deal absolutes (insert star wars meme) deal probability. mean know joke that's literally got delta variant. makes virus mutate. Wonder he'll get mother. surprised *data* coming Florida. Heart inflamation eh? checked. mild symptom that's hit people. goes away.  know go away?  325 children died. Ahh, yes, dreaded contagious infectious car accident. obtuse fuck. think comment meant say athlete free choose organizers free introduce consequences, e.g. excluding competition Lol downvotes surprise, expect feel way. Reddit weird place though. Covid subs especially touchy. Toe line!!!  OANN research Bart? guess people get sick delta variant despite fully vaccinated 🙃, booster shot please. proactive once.

Hear, hear. One defining characteristics pandemic people, even educated responsible ones, unable think week ahead. bar association logo either! Technically, idea side effects could face multitude substances ingest - natural manmade - yet people don’t give second thought. 
Antivaxxers choosing scared proven short / medium term (which pointed elsewhere historically speaking relevant ) side effects statistically speaking palatable. 

We know short medium long term effects COVID-19 are, anyone reviews available data make decision simply cannot choose get jab. 
Btw, hesitant trial phases successfully completed, wouldn’t faulted anyone camp data freely available proving concerns vaccines naught. 79%, back 95%. Great another reason Karens boycott vaccine. I'm sure everyone posting thread review evidence presented posting knee-jerk opinions. country. ministry health really state much details much wait get vaccined. that's I'm asking. notice I'v recovered 2 months ago. I'm confused take vaccine not? Yet, I'm scared

Doubt.  know hard understand sometimes people change mind based data.

When Bidens team knew federal mask mandate would likely survive SCOTUS would likely cause trouble worth changed mind..

It's state issue even states mandated extremely, impossible time , enforcing it

Also completely disingenuous saying criticism Trump mask mandate, actively pushed back science wearing masks. It’s back!! cut internet, block every site Russia West. COVID-19 also cause myocarditis, like other/all? viral infections. chest pains 2 weeks second dose think, Governor thinking running president 2024. Absolute nightmare. Wow, may?

Take seriously get vaccinated.   point feel 100% safe going gym vaccinated.

That point. not. vaccine 100% efficient particularly delta, even two doses, gyms place particular emission infectious particles. OP needs risk analysis. 

Israeli data, might methodological issues puts protection two doses Pfizer 66%. far away 100%. data Canada UK puts best 88-92%. 100%. Plus know OP´s age, weight, race rational people know feel safe pretty much everything pre-pandmeic.

If New Zealand makes sense. anywhere else, maybe misled false sense security worth reanalyzing regarding vaccination data area, infection rates, kind variants area particular health.

Is everybody double vaccinated 100% safe delta variant areas outbreak it? No. Not, 100% sure.

And vaccination still good, best choice possible even guarantee 100% invulnerability. Turning vaccination all-or-nothing protection thing seriously wrong. Well one antinatalist matter anyway. “Free speech, millions dead!”

Oh! hang on, got screwed here....

“Free speech? No! Millions dead!” saw reply still aren’t understanding you’re willingly misinterpreting response given People Florida always say reason Florida Man meme exists LE make every call public. COVID proof stupidity definitely deserves blame.  Florida? Seriously? Wow. mean, difficult guess used think too, tbh I've perceived lot coworkers friends feel way, also noticed lots media fear mongering delta variant said entertainment industry seeing lot cancellations lately. Alarm bells going head. Vaccinated people need them. That's problem. Vaccinations alone enough stop spread new variants, especially Delta reportedly 225% higher chance contagion Alpha variant. you’re cool getting Covid? asking. efficacy numbers trending way downward 95%. 60%ish range that’s almost coin flip Covid often lasting effects I'm 46 age small comfort. know number low, hope stays way.  explained fine, understood well. See, problem redditors. desperately worry anything could make vaccine look dangerous.

Here finding shows possible suffer heart inflammation vaccinated shots.

Okay, that's good know.

Redditors going insane, saying rare nothing worry even consider it. WTF ThInKiNg HeArT iNfLaMmAtIoN??? Dont think rArE consider!


This good view take this. take consideration, acknowledge it. Yes rare, happen. careful. educate ourselves. wouldnt stop getting vaccine, would likely get Jensen anyways. good idea take info try make others disregard it.

Even height pandemic covid spread schools kid kid getting sick hospitalized. think shut society unless zero preventable deaths what. working well amount vaccinated low Why? simple way get back normal things. don’t get kids vaccinated know you’re selfish also wrong one. They're 1000% hook damages. Remember waiver?  elderly country chance get vaccinated months ago. didn’t get jab solely based convictions. 100% eligible waitlist. several pro vaccination drives trying convince them, …

As bad sounds there’s cure stupid mourn dead. No... please reread comment. 100 vaccinated people even infected scenario reduction infection stacks reduction hospitalizations. 92% reduction hospitalization RATE. 15% 15*.08 1.2%. 100 people rate 1.2%, would see 1 infection.

Only example include 10,000 vaccinated people 1,000 unvaccinated people would see 12 hospitalized vaccinated people. Also teacher school announced recently don’t need wear masks we’re vaccinated, also aren’t going ask you’re vaccinated. know fact several colleagues unmasked unvaccinated. It’s summer school right won’t change fall building full. wore masks past year it’s looking like won’t fall, considering students young vaccinated don’t understand changed them. It’s gross risking students. I’ve lost lot respect people won’t protect others pandemic.

According Isaac Cary got vaccinated Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine March, said 85 percent effective severe/critical disease, hospitalization Yea, definitely behaving irresponsible start I'm fine wrong. I'd happier higher number. Kids also get flu colds. don’t worry kid dying myocarditis those, you?

But 100% right vaccinating kids 12. isn’t much data here. unknown...current research shows safe, especially compared alternative catching COVID unvaccinated.

To say unknown implies shipped vaccines everyone without single idea would happen long term.

As Fauci claim, completely irrelevant we're talking about. YES TRUE COVID. dont know people don’t understand dying severe covid complications probably best outcome. long term effects covid (even young people) appear debilitating life altering issues. heart inflammation actually common covid patients vaccinated people. risks young people getting vaccine unless severe allergy one ingredients get head sand OK. 85% less chance getting sick vaccinated. That's 100% less chance. means people going get sick. happening. like unvaccinated person 0% chance getting sick, either. 33 million people US contracted far, 600,000 died. 

The information article fear-mongering (although maybe headline is): reminder highly effective vaccines highly effective, bulletproof. vaccinated person, chance getting sick dance floor full unmasked, vaccination-status-unknown people higher chance getting sick going normal activities people masked and/or vaccinated and/or physically distant people. Nobody's saying stay home hide bed, might want reconsider activities higher-risk. COVID-19 outbreak Oklahoma gymnastics gym infected 47 people two weeks, including gymnasts, staff members household contacts — 40 unvaccinated, federal health officials 21 COVID-19 cases sequenced determine version coronavirus caused them, samples identified highly contagious delta variant, according Centers Disease Control Prevention report published outbreak, occurred April 15 May 3, adds existing evidence suggests delta variant higher attack rates variants concern, meaning infect people exposure.

I wonder reported now? 3 months attack rate among infected gymnasts staff members 20% 53% among household infected people unvaccinated, three partially vaccinated one dose completed four fully vaccinated. infected ranged 5 58 years old, though median age 14.

… Could cases also caused something else, know sure vaccine? ""man versus man"" narrative lot interesting story talk about. heroes villains, possibility justice administered end. 

The ""man versus nature"" story less interesting. Theres bad guy, moral sometimes nature kills people.  read full statement. It’s hard understand booster wouldn’t needed time delta variant infecting fully vaccinated individuals. 

It’s possible infection rate fully vaccinated individuals low enough cripple public health infrastructure services that’s lens Fauci viewing through. someone small children 5, don’t want give Covid kids. would imagine thousands others like boat.  would think problem would eventually work evolution, breed like jackrabbits. one dying 50 (there here)...not vaccinated.

From Eight people age 50 died getting Delta variant, data showed. None fully vaccinated, two received one dose vaccine. Wait gets pockets unvaccinated people there's gunna mayhem fall also need donating volunteering support progressive candidates world place principle profit. exist, aren’t good voting lack funding. wealthy leave husk planet us children lose second sleep it. Us vs them. received J&amp;J vaccine, claim 85%. 

Fully vaccinated Texas man would better headline, especially many one dose. tends happen lot viruses.

I read somewhere (can't remember, definitely scholarly source, take pinch salt) result body mounting immune response.

Of course, body mounts immune response sorts things, viruses seem major contributor. point is, specifically *vaccine* related. concluding evolved naturally. saying lab leak plausible. So, theory, could isolated naturally occurring virus worker contacted virus accidently.  would make statements true. keep telling deniers unvaccinated people account 99% recent covid deaths. claim answers. know inventor MRNA technology record saying get vaccine right young. He's read pharmaceutical report Japan received believes possibility long term effects vaccine. can't possibly know MRNA vaccine inventor MRNA vaccine technology. He's claiming definitely long term effects believes probability autoimmune diseases possible cancer relating vaccine would take 2-5 years show up. think I'll listen says research needs done. Category risk tail risk matters. stupid mean median like study article claiming “10 fold event” 

I’m means vax one got wonder risk/benefit profile is. 

There’s reason vaccines ruled OK kids oms said it’s clear teenagers either. 

If 25 pathologies risk dying covid negligible. Getting viral myocarditis detectable gone virus getting one unpredictable, vaccine induced grave consequences, however small chances may be. 

This absence evidence evidence absence. Meaning effects may take long long time noticed. nothing worrisome shown data means it’s without question. 

Obviously society whole big concern vaccines yield huge positive overall. individual, ones gotta careful “science based” facts there. sources say studies invalidated? Happy read links doubt you’ll find any.  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Quite yes, trend vaccinated people get disease, vaccinated, disease little limited effect. vaccinations always worked.  15% last month. posting good faith change mind. Four  Let's hope translate big increase hospitalizations rising cases 0-29 age group whilst every age group still declining mean, fired nurses Texas refused get vaccinated.

Honestly, healthcare worker refuse get vaccinated, probably anywhere near healthcare job. definitely fired. [This says hospitalizations 13% week ago. really finding much recent info.

Yes, paper that’s happen. rubber meets road, know, things don’t always work way paper.

However say vaccination turns Covid mild cold (or allergies?) nothing substantiate claims inference supposition. I'm wondering thing. Hopefully there's evidence behind it. would incredible news! true, there’s tons unvaccinated people around world allow new variants develop. Florida Texas way better India, example. You’d need vaccinate entire world stop angle. Yeah, people confuse type information lot surprise media enjoying it. example israeli study rang many alarms due 65% efficcency infections. Asymptomatic infection still remains 90% before.

Now real question children inmunocompromised still get COVID result viral load asymptomatic, boosters full government approval children vaccines come handy. cat already bag, 2020 lockdowns/mandates gonna happen again. Holy shit. heart beating irregularly, like skipped beat every minutes."
