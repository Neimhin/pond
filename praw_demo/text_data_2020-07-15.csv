0,2020-07-15," living Northwest, ""the heck Kroger?"" HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA think descent origin story Mandalorians starwars. not

Source: sis lives works them. think absolutely telling customers ""mask GTFO.""

Admittedly one going authority physically remove customer complying, store manager I'd make dang sure tell cashiers ring anyone wearing mask entire time inside store. White House anything say it!

What deaths? talking about? delusional, go infirmary. Actually don't. infirmary full. all. Americans screwed long 50 different states god-knows-how-many counties cities thing. sort states-rights approach pandemic going fail. Trump incompetent ever accomplish this.. try tho needed crush curve effective lockdown, develop form robust test trace program. nope. electoral college inherently wrong.  problem winner take approach.  


If 5 people Wyoming vote Republican, 3 electoral college votes go Republicans.  BUT, 3 5 people Wyoming vote Republican, electoral college votes split. Less people pulling guns mask wearing, least 5g murdered grand nephew's sister's BFF. get point chicken egg.. time government recommending masks virus already community spread, imagine doctors nurses dropped sick already happened.. virus spreading need care hospitals.. spreading professionals deliver care.. overload hospital deaths high.. imagine lack care didnt even mask all.. atleast time forced reuse masks, magnitudes better nothing.

Finally, think it.. government said mask even cloth, majority Americans would say fuck that, gimme 500 N95's, clean shelves.. hell masks already extremely hard find without stoking flames.

Edit: far claims go virus came lab.. isnt concrete evidence that, worth time arguing. simply know true.  TIL Kroger largest supermarket chain US Ok...took minute realize getting at. yeah I‚Äôm really poor family best paying job I‚Äôve ever had. really can‚Äôt anything jeopardise right now. figure corporation going same, worse. ya se lo Bolsonearon fight back, wanna assume choice push back? must... confused? understand surgical masks keep spreading(and much catching), N95 masks better job both. filter large particles (like surgical masks), also 95 percent small particles(hence name). one way? Unless wearing one open valve, would assume would also better job keeping germs spreading...no? point I'm hoping gets higher burn quicker. 
 
Obviously that's awful everyone getting sick idiot asshole protesting masks. seems like cases keep rising nothing's going change. could care less unborn. care votes guarantee saying magic words. capture 40% vote rest platform literally anything all. basically devote rest efforts capturing 10%+1 votes. depends state county, maybe city, you‚Äôre in. governor who, objectively, produced lousiest coronavirus results far (Cuomo) also possibly highest approval rating. one's getting recalled screwing coronavirus. There's bunch countries handled without like either China US, led awful people right now. Fauci working Trump, he's working best interest population United States; happens mean working (or ""for"") Trump detail. get it, still lumping Americans broad group. accurate, specific subset blame generalizing ""Americans"" giving truly responsible much courtesy.

The majority supports masks, lockdowns, social distancing, angry incompetent leadership. small cult mouth breathers get define American.  waste time debating person. history full immature rants 'zoomers' people dare use improper grammar anonymous platform.

Also, parents bad. thing gonna save US vaccine, take 2 6 months That's fine good. teach employees wear mask properly, wear noses. Nah, Kroger anything. sis works people front enforce mask thing nothing I'd walkthrough hanging face wearing one all. employees seem 50/50, half wearing half ""wearing it"" (mask pulled nose pull away mouth completely talk).

Oh one stores near 2 staff members come it. tell staff, tell stores asking workers from.

Kroger care anything outside making money, promise bring teeth this. post signs ""enforcer"", actually enforce anything all.

Lol lie tell staff installed bunch new cameras watch compliance. told work progress ask proof. fucking horrible. Yep, got email includes ""tips de-escalation"" agree. someone dies sudden everyone act certain way negate behavior got begin with? feeling bad people killed negligence? cannot breathe wearing face mask like pictures sold everywhere, probably talk doctor six months ago Kroger doesn‚Äôt even put sanitizer wipes carts. don‚Äôt see enforcing either. Jesus kind hellhole needs full time police officer stationed walmart hope see one guy passion data talking another like-minded guy. 

Girls can't like data too? ;) lol

I see going might better (more sustainable) solution I've got currently. I'm usually cross-eyed end day staring dates numbers day work I'll save post re-read weekend. Thank feedback &amp; input! I'm excel wizard I'm always looking ways streamline things. 

If already joined us /r/CoronavirusAZ check out! people still trying clothes changing rooms? first time made sense buy clothes online. Fuck corona clothes.  big states *are* represented electoral college. win presidency winning 11 states 51% even everyone else every state votes 100% you.

That means win presidency 28% votes cast. kind feel like going onto Facebook page one write realized must conspiracy put forth people want build colony space. 


Where I'm serious statement getting Hell planet sounding pretty good, right now. Three words. Curb side pickup. can‚Äôt something personally doesn‚Äôt mean allowed it. Someone say get ptsd wearing pants public, doesn‚Äôt mean allowed shop underwear. r/maskskepticism going go meltdown. What‚Äôs wait, FFS Florida report government tests, 8%, rest private... there's book big enough fit everything trump Republicans fucked up. this, day Trump leaves office handcuffs real patriots nation turn attention made living hell happen make sure NEVER happens again. murderous traitors righteous indignation freedom fucking joke.

Hey sorry cannot find terroristic threat and/or murder threat comment, mind pointing out?

Also, recommendations sources research stepping-stone agenda? Fuckin ouch mate. Holy shit, better good ass meeting keep locked long. Imma follow you, make post it? Deport people deny entry. Pick ones property family Canada double ban set example. joke. Americans barred life visiting family Ontario going condo Whistler people _will_ get message. one things basis reality. important people us right healthcare workers forced deal uncontrollable mess risking health so. Ignorance, stupidity selfishness got us round don‚Äôt kid medical doctors nurses don‚Äôt see way. decide tomorrow throw hands say screw it, it‚Äôs game us regardless anyone‚Äôs personal views, opinions beliefs regarding virus. need come senses. lol wish pretending, bud. I've never seen much blatant misinformation life. rofl  1918, cars new 737s didnt exist.

Go Karen sub...absolutely dominated (comments too) one specific demo.

You may believe...but replied may not.   Watched Disney World stream we're screwed.  got downvoted reason I‚Äôm sure people really quite grasping depths despair US falling into. NEED vaccine. NEED vaccine Corporations taking charge usual Abutt public school even put conditions attendance like that? *really* hope wrong. fear right :( ‚ÄúBut freeeeeeeeeeedom‚Äù happy im north border street/outside spotty, grocery stores almost people masks. anywhere else 4 months death wish can't comment bars anything. 'I never shop again' final pathetic tool Karen arsenal. emptiest threats Lol, guy listens YouTube doctors definitely qualifications determine Fauci (a nationally known doctor) talking ‚Äúgood advice‚Äù. ends 30% consistently.

The problem see 70% try follow guidelines they're trying stay away shit like this. love guys. nationwide parties *must* best parties lives. Yeah agree. end day live together. go store. everyone follows expert guidance (they know shit spent lifetime thing again) genuinely try come common ground like problem mask use delivery curbside pickup. Use rights long doesn‚Äôt put anyone else risk. Chinese lab Kroger largest supermarket chain US?! That‚Äôs odd don‚Äôt even one within 50 mile radius Added upvote behalf :) logic, reason, compassion case leader, 8th grade vocabulary. former NJ person,am glad see state serious,since top near top terms population density collecting capital! Easy you‚Äôre already rich. immunologist, even bother commenting subject? upvote ignorant economics make sense figure billion dollars, thank breakdown. day reached 5K USD savings felt safe forever.   
Although attached political/economical ideology (probably dumb understand any), like saying ""property theft"", live many might consider little (more might consider luxury) comfort.   
I seen deep eyes hungry, Everyone lives comfort.   
1 million, 60 Billion, looks similar stand.... unreachable yet frustrating. Teachers go strike vs make wills sent unnecessary deaths. still see odd Karen there, mask long enough get doors. I've also seen full grown man whine like baby put one convenience store. Luckily, anti-mask people appear small minority around here. Clusterfuck Thats get apparently haha. think theres like hundreds grocery chains someone elses reply thinking theres like dozen like 30 different names üòÇ Lol fucking WHAT?! CONSTITUTION says federal government can't tell country wear masks? Ya, get it, delay. Wish jersey. love visiting parents cause Kroger‚Äôs Meijers! go? Exactly, people either REALLY want masks wearing to. people total shit stirrers unfortunately seems like good number become verbally aggressive violent (because correlation wearing masks low intelligence tendency violence. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre eating lead paint). Nah definitely run mill cold virus made us paranoid. Unfortunately coincided bad allergy season. I've days weirdest stabbing pains throat.. turns allergies hah. local news source Louisville, Kentucky. such, appears source regarding particular individual. May ask concerns reputability? Pretending everyone lying gives cover ones actually lying. seriously feel like I'm going crazy. idea COVID widespread belief? company requires masks times, yet compliance all-time low since started, especially among higher-ups. People going vacations parties, etc. look weird one person still actually cares stuff. really great hearing secretary education say ""only 0.02%"" children die reopen schools. 

0.02% children US around 12,000. 12,000 dead kids considered acceptable government. include teachers staff. 

And since hurried reopen, progress made first shut null void. 

I hate country. ""Good news everyone! breathe easier die quicker.""

-Governor Kemp main issue think specifically tracked hospitals. since post-infection syndromes happening weeks even months children recovered COVID, difficult connect back that's specifically looked medical cases.

Scientists largely track instances one one ton work. 

So likely seeing full extent many children impacted this. Hubris people

Robert California? Awesome! ""they great working vaccine September"".  can't help think sounds like line spoken certain person instead team scientists. There‚Äôs 4 week lag. takes time die Yea give guy break man. common

""Why waste time say lot word word trick?""


Just say 'Republicans' cringe Florida always stupid. living rock? maybe shit would sink people. Like holy hell, Canada barricaded us military. Winter approaching, heard world class elite cold weather fighters there. Gonna lot angry Karen video 22nd. B know actually lower oxygen levels? fluid lungs massive covid infection.  happens, blame corporates blame police usual... fucking denying wear damn mask... many succeeded? can't imagine we'd emporer orange closed boarders 'very early'. they'll nice/diplomatic it, -- can't tell potential ""customers"" ""mask GTFO"".

Why can‚Äôt they? That‚Äôs exactly employees supermarkets do. good news. 

It enforced. true. Fortunately rest states benefit misfortune. get treat patients protocols learned part deaths many people NYC area. 

I sincerely hope death rate remains highest country. That's sign progress, that's hoping for. getting topic. talking needing cops stores. saying fund community avoid needing them. 

I advocating abolishment police. still deal domestic violence violent crime. stuff correct always form. police longer right solution drug crisis country getting rid petty theft. Funding community, schools, drug counselors rehab, crisis intervention teams way forward Necessity mother invention never true. vaccine ever fast, there's never amount need one.

We're guaranteed going work yet, I'm definitely optimistic well. Release Karens.  Everyone comments : ""walmart lost business.""

Walmart : ""lol like give fuck Karen."" wrong Trump? *"" It‚Äôs true evidence masks weak before. That‚Äôs changed. ""*

No wasn't.. sufficient evidence masks long time. point someone believe efficacy masks amount data convince them. Luckily everyone get ICU bed whenever need it... think china keeping track numbers? letting people ""claim"" medical reasons wearing one? Wyoming Montana...which spiking well. You‚Äôre proving point- correlation protests rising rates. Lol fuck off. dare concern family thrown quickly back high risk environment doesn‚Äôt come nearly enough compensation justify risk. awesome analogy, thanks sharing forget past something something open schools back population stating making kids wear masks, way how...so yeah, child sacrifice works Nolt said, part, Amish date COVID-19 news.

The Amish literally better informed Republicans Piggy back... World population 1918 ~1.8 billion. 1/3 600 million. 50 million died, 8.3% death rate.  CDC guesses Covid-19 death rate 0.2% (June 5, 2020) 13 million. 

Multiple estimates show 0.05% covid 19 death rate 3.3 million. estimates 0.3 0.6 million deaths flu worldwide per year put context. good data number deaths covid 19 data muddy. Chances around 0.15 million worldwide today (580k * 0.25). keeps work despite chained drooling idiot. Time magazine person year material Last week watched woman pull mask cough open air, put back on. nose, even! many triggered snowflakes. FrEeDuMzzzz basically deadly 1918 flu, better treatments it. That's scary. Live mid city Los Angeles, area takes pretty serious (masks, social distance) South Bay, valley (from I‚Äôve too) much. Didn‚Äôt really see many mask. forget met Elon Musk President Trump, among countless others, last 2 weeks. mean didn‚Äôt anyone half brain anyone works med field already knew. took long official say beyond AAI (American Association Immunologists) also did. got two emails morning. really medical group, still huge research organization. state opened back shutdown required employees wear masks social distance 6 feet required put shield. mandated time customer wear mask although establishment could require chose. nephew went back work first day reopening chewed non mask wearing customer. customer offended stepped back short distance required social distancing placing merchandise counter customer examine. Customer made huge scene yelled poor kid job following rules state mandated. asshole people. good answer. Ranked Choice Voting right answer. since think happen anytime soon, really hope least fix winner take approach. Yo, someone kick 2020 bus ride? need GTFO fast Quo vadis America? people US normalized mask usage sick like countries pandemic. People would much receptive masks. Single Infectious Disease clinician here... surprised. Everyone thinks cool start getting comfortable telling work stories dinner. Lmao would rather dick head every store front bitching people??? capital city we've lockdown 4 months now.... *COULD* operative word firing range open boys! /s  There‚Äôs good answer response Thank service. Doug Ducey Douche, butcher Grand Canyon State, first name, damp squib.   Sounds good Americans telling leave country disagreeing them, way holy way Patriots. Rot hell fucking scum bag million percent, making crazy libs figured they're constantly trolled distracted. 

The recent Goya fiasco obvious, worked intended. Japanese culture see contrast Americans... right-wing media moguls powering narrative. mean tried impeach him, now.

We right beside one epicenters. also pretty large drop amount work Wolf put in.

It took minute get Florida caught fire going blossom, especially considering huge population elderly there.  know everything US tends big, sincerely hope things improve short term. numbers staggering.  ship sailed soon certain politicians made wearing mask political football. cultists even fucking realize they're sacrificial lambs led slaughter. insanity. sounds bit extreme, guess works Honest question, much death rate due deadly virus vs medical treatments vs people generally poor health vs understanding anything disease prevention. Like plauge struck 1900, would deadly? problem younger people 99.9% chance surviving.

So vaccine needs least far less harmful disease. Worth killing higher bar worth dying over. Nothing administration makes sense. agree poster, came hard strong covid-19, packaged anti-China sentiment, got control get go, would 2020 election grasps. Instead, he's moron, inept, completely unable feel sadness pain (i.e. empathy / sympathy). again, handlers trying sow division worst way possible public health crisis. incapable right thing. astonishing. nothing political pandemic, unsurprising made political.

Now, see cult lunatics more. aggressive fellow cult lunatics see covid reality simply less stupid.

These anti-maskers ignorant, entitled, self-righteous. Full stop. really fucking hard put mask comply rules **private business**. morons 2A threaten stepping shitty lawn. Again, simply astonishing.

In end though, vote. Nothing else matters. Vote fucking morons out. them. ‚ÄútHiS rIgHtS!‚Äù 
Or
‚ÄúThe metal strip mask antenna 5g!‚Äù

Can‚Äôt believe one‚Äôs actually going around. üòÇ

The damn strips back 3g! üßê rhymes ‚ÄúM‚Äù stands Moron! aMeRiCaN fReEdOm!!!!!!! dare shortage PPE! devious bastard. Love accuracy post. going gut wrenching. awful. USA #1! think thinking Jehovah Witnesses. know stand masks. None come knocking since l told believe bible. think statement gets rid good. Population U.K. 66mil. 
7 day average U.K. 718 new cases day. 
Assume everyone tests positive day contagious 10 days. 
Assume 1 10 cases captured tests. 

718*10*10 / 66mil = 0.00109

So there‚Äôs 1/1000 chance exposed group one. Don‚Äôt push luck group size though (999/1000)^g grows quickly g, group size, goes up. course did...  American, sorry countries. guess. airlines already it, FAA mandate make people wear masks. 

I'm guessing chicks contract needs national headline secure votes keep job. Protecting people‚Äôs lives isn‚Äôt progressive sweatie. Maybe Alabama standards. 8 Russian experts quarantined upon arrival. flight total 69 passengers. Still pretty high positive rate people coming back Russia.  that‚Äôs exactly is...and still hear crickets probably never then. Unless enough idiots become victim willful ignorance. Sad. right, recently protests California Oregon. Florida. states care BLM. Good job, top logic. know vaccine developed, United States going first country get it. country world guts ability stand America. reason hard people care federal leadership gives shits anyone demonstrates freedom.  I‚Äôd say 95% wearing masks. Everyone gonna start raw dogging on. mostly joke. ones remember people knew, ones TV. Don‚Äôt forget mail ballots discouraged wants people able vote November win coming election. covid keeps up, many people won‚Äôt go polls vote. Walmart enters conversation. Kroger follows. converse casket late governor Oklahoma Kevin Stitt, ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt way.‚Äù anyone checked Elon Musk, though? Stitt Oklahoma July 5th. maskless. Lmao. I'm literally giving asked for. preferred it? ""They think full shit""? dunno. Next time I'll blunt. would happy look links adding brand spanking new system layers including private company going make better? Still trials - we‚Äôll know months ‚ÄúAnd people would die maybe something entirely different. Something natural like new monia. call new monia it‚Äôs new, beautiful. many new monias. Like one‚Äôs ever seen before, maybe ever.‚Äù Awesome!! China‚Äôs coverup initial outbreak, none us would situation. gotta something lockdown log onto FB kickback real entertainment lol Hey, MD top 5 least. Maybe make podium. Fauci gave us shout out.. Can‚Äôt wait suddenly many people dollar general Basically giant test subject point... always tomorrow.  \-And takes several people along it. Nothing value lost. hope employee pulls through. filtered through? private company? refreshing see people authority advocate mass death once. currently making 100 million doses...that‚Äôs 200 million right there! Nope... things hard... like wearing mask. reading article day major hospitals turning people away. hospitals aren‚Äôt technically full they‚Äôre probably functionally full they‚Äôre sending extra medical personnel various places Texas.

Alternatively things could actually worsening Abbott boys could fuckin numbers. knows. Unless actually real doctor's note probably not. Aunt Doremi Fa, dear They're holding they're using neckwarmers. think might optimistic. Looks like US country dumb citizens. nursing homes, elderly people.

As virus reaches people ages, die well. People every age die COVID, different rates. 

I think really much understanding population third world countries. Even Sudan average life expectancy 65. 

And also think clue words mean. Average life expectancy age people die, means 1/2 people live longer that, 1/2 won't. 

But infant mortality high countries, depresses mean age. older get, longer life expectancy is. die time 1, life expectancy goes up; die 20s, live much longer 65 years.

So umm, no, clue talking about. Another upset trump snowflake. Get tissues. understand I'm supposed get bike pump dickhole needle mouth. Pls help bonner fadding. guys drove around July 4th? Absolute shit fest. Parks packed little mask wearing ‚Äúhow supposed eat barbecue mask on?‚Äù

I dipped fuck almost immediately.

Friend sent Snapchat waterfall upstate park. masks, social distancing all. Walmart, New York, cartel south border, crap together,

 \-and rest us adult babies meltdowns haircuts masks. stayed fuck home July 4th. Haha stupid question vaccine available masses? teacher private school Dallas supposed work summer camp started June, pushed July, cancelled week before. school year starting mid March, would pretty much update every two weeks whether went back school. Still plenty time change minds. realize it‚Äôs different situation public schools, still think it‚Äôs early call anything. wait last possible second. Okay convert deaths since Japan uses metric system Tell ‚Äúgod God‚Äù  aren‚Äôt reported, don‚Äôt exist. mean aren‚Äôt reported CDC, maybe COVID really going disappear own. ears? Already wearing oxygen mask? stopped treatments; things planned ahead delayed while. frees beds Drink Kool-Aid? o.O probably ‚Äúluvfarming‚Äù that‚Äôs you‚Äôre capable of, fucking feeble minded loser. guys drove around July 4th? Absolute shit fest. Parks packed little mask wearing ‚Äúhow supposed eat barbecue mask on?‚Äù

I dipped fuck almost immediately. I‚Äôm young healthy live hot zone. figure soldiers could storm beaches Normandy take vaccine Good charts another concern raised Chinese back late March.

 Concerns aerosolized, concerns limited immune response, concers asymptomatic transmission, concers long lingering morbidities even mild cases, concerns regarding male infertility, concerns blood clotting, concerns reinfection, concerns 1%+ IFR, concerns high (5%+ R0 value) .... concerns reported discussed Chinese, Koreans Taiwanese end March wtf post 1: larger larger proportion tests come positive, yes ACTUALLY cases.

2: smaller percentage bigger number still big number. 10% NYC infected death 0.5% 20% Florida infected death rate 0.25%, number deaths same, except lot sick people hospitals Florida. Governor Florida going find soon.

3: Due fact 2 Trump DeSantis lie statistics, that's going change reality. Take upvote, I'm dying here! 70,000 people sick enough get tested. Many jobs require testing, many people know got tested hell it. 


In last sentence described current life almost exactly. add exercise. Sure did.

Measles epidemics caused significant panic. Masks mandatory Spanish flu epidemic, people literally boarded home diseases.

People never continued life normal response wide spread disease. pretty sure would want someone indebted you, vs not. least American capitalism. see point, directors hospital going say shoot, dang look customers. We've tried nothing we're ideas current female birth control doesn‚Äôt even matter point. people refuse wear mask selfish, terrible, ridiculous people don‚Äôt care dies. Fuck them. Dr Rick Bright said US would need additional billion needles roll vaccine there‚Äôs already shortage (in whistleblower report), factors 20% increase demand flu vaccine annoying thing see people say things like letting run course 1% people much stop lives 99%. reason people understand reason begin with? want whole survival fittest mentality sometimes feel like listen way. think US earned right lab rats. mean president spent day whoring beans White House desk CEO. Thanks PPP pay bonus‚Äôs friends. rest go get money unemployment line think America point need prove bad deniers start taking seriously eventually beat thing. might reading intent wrong. Take look Clorox's web site. Huge pop telling ingest inject bleach. can't jump party bus. Especially since establishment rigged things robbed us someone going save us. anyone downvotes me‚Äî literally happening ive delt self someone multiple time survivor actually went braindead 6 min last time permanent brain damage disabled. People lost hope. Actually may cause temporary baldness. trigger telogen effluvium. hell took long? fauci bouta stage medical coupe I‚Äôm confused last sentence. Deblasio one didn‚Äôt want schools closed ‚Äúthere wouldn‚Äôt anyone feed poor hungry kids.‚Äù Cuomo urge days close schools. I‚Äôd say casino might best customers pandemic. Clear risk takers willing bet chance. Plus owners friendly Donnie, it‚Äôs hard sell. recieved care right away....no line anything. 

And think, pretty young, might able pay dead too. would God that? Governor DeathSentence still waiting apology. Idk, maybe people exited potential republican wipeout. previous peak looks uncanny. Amen brother. Here‚Äôs Canada. spent many great days Montreal Ottawa college years. That's awful idea. imagine would happen serious side effects? discount ""no frills"" grocer stores, higher end grocery stores, Case Fred Meyer Walmart hypermarket sells wide range merchandise 

Most however basically ""kroger different name"" mom's nose uncovered. Trump pumped people masks patriotic help us win crap, could saved. public listening certain media keeps telling people blindly trust president publicly wrong dozens times health official wrong once.

Instead listening man admits made mistake, people listening man claims never makes mistakes. doubt much. We're month away unleash pandemic classrooms across country.  depends are, (Florida). course did, he's Republican, he's failure matter outcome still going? kind sale get reference. üòô read article, looks like potential temporary reduction number motility sperm, permanent infertility. less people alive, less virus kill.

ü§îü§îü§î No, people's willfull ignorance people listening. Even though there's new information given due better understanding people choose cling information fits narrative. 

No one today complains remove asbestos today since hindsight showed people lied safety new information showed otherwise. Sadly, point, we're watching Darwinism unfold mass scale. people seem want die. protect let idiots infection orgies, hoping take many innocents process. Practice. Gyms still open US? Indoor facilities sweat breathe heavily touching million surfaces wasn‚Äôt enough close gyms?  know couple people home sick get tested. Confirmed around someone test positive. Worried lot others TX US boat. 2019 flu vaccine? really ineffective last year - 60% doctor buddies saying. Normally it‚Äôs like 80-90%. Apparently kind guess mutations spread didn‚Äôt get quite right something. seems like xenophobic thing say part. white? infestation koalas honestly really taking toll coworkers friends well. way things are, hate say I'm ashamed American right now. need nationwide sitdown review this. never realized many people trouble reading graphs applying logic. Idiots last week talking about, ""what deaths tho""... Take Karens! Fred Meyer live, think owned Kroger? Maybe? carry Kroger brand products store brand stuff anyway, already requires that, maybe state mandate point, Washington. amazing beginning around - much, much better grocery chain. got worse went on. Now, care all. There's bottle sanitizer roll paper towel wipe cart - bottle empty often not. changed lines checkout way everyone pretty much forced close together. stopped shopping there. Plague rats defend m-m-muh economy. kidding? handle. considerably competent medical faculty.

Problem is, Central government already gotten complacent started political infighting opposition (including party) troubling response. quote Beavis Butthead, 'Uh.. guy needs go doctor tell ""I suck!'"" Underrated comment Ron Howard: think pure narcissism, malice. thinks opinion, ""expertise"" anyone else's. truly believes right else, victory obtained means forged path, would confirmation he's bag o' crisps.

So choice, one wont shatter narcissistic world vision himself, stay course. Right iceberg. U.K. already massage figures got trouble it. lying. I‚Äôve never thankful live state. We‚Äôre normally near bottom health related things, governor doesn‚Äôt give shit cryers what‚Äôs best. Like thank god beat Republican asshole going re-election. numbers pretty low, still issued mask mandate last week. still idiots going freakin Myrtle Beach Florida vacation. even though county judge placed injunction governor‚Äôs mask mandate next day, far I‚Äôve stores city signs telling people must wear masks due order god like 100% people wearing masks. feel much worse countrymen states. Nigeria too. large supermarkets enforcing masks months. US unique among ****hole countries. southern Governors? South rise horseshit? make feel manly buck scientific certainty masks work? Fucking morons. Correction: see peak deaths 4 weeks Sun Belt states shut down. Good luck btw. hivemind real. 9/11 affect rest world nearly much covid that's caused lack desire procreate easy access contraception, actual ability babies... 

That said, think 2100 worlds population plummet really fast (that's UN predicted peak population). look Japan, currently 129 million people 2100 predicted hit around 80 million... 1% b¬£tch heard God here. Take actions hands.  answered question. going poorly, blaming it. know, man said ""Do open anything number new cases declines solid 14 days"" think i've seen one before. They're going give hemlock next, right?

Edit: Please tell know Socrates reference jab Fauci  That's true, far useless. mask one part protection plague.

They also wore long waxed cotton jacket would protected insect bites majority infected fluids blood, used gloves, used long cane inspect infected avoid touching them. plague doctors still high mortality rate, would likely much higher use precautions all. Thanks automod, helpful. Coughing COVID-19 symptom. Ideally, would immediately isolate 3rd cough, go home persisted. This- comment here- issue.

Wtf america lol Best hop euphemism treadmill add ever growing list words naughty actually fixing real problems world. bet wholesale bought White Fragility too. reason call ""ableist slurs"" actually think good, it? easy moral posturing. Quinnipiac poll car today stated 53% respondents infected COVID knew someone infected. it‚Äôs definitely real majority Americans. Covid19 obviously big bag crap, various governments handled things appallingly.

But live age able assess understand disease extent, vaccines likely ready roughly year, incremental breakthroughs announced days, make almost proud human.  first time heard Kroger (I'm EU) think believe vaccine protective day 43 day 57 üòÇ two weeks meant need test show whether person COVID-19 likely going die exposed again. Clearly IgG specific tests tell limited story adding context. Stocks going last three months. Unemployment payments run July 25th. Congress want extend unemployment payments, also seem arguing another stimulus. want send kids school tell everyone go back work. 

Either way, 30m+ poor unemployed, rich getting richer. Every time smell shit, there's fecal matter air. federal response hope best.

This really fucked individual state response federal agencies supposed charge early detection. Trump busy golfing tweeting take seriously. tagged 'world'? US story - like 99% sub. basically r/news point. downside: take heparin.

It‚Äôs way... want look like Ebola.  karen equivalent murder archduke ferdinand anyone else never Kroger, barely heard it? I'm employee I've also heard argument... makes sense personally. ""I'm gonna endanger myself, show 'em I'm worth!"" Several bought parent company left were, people would continue see normal grocery store. That's many different names, left original purpose. Man lot speculation different claims post. interesting though I‚Äôll share thoughts them.

Virologists said haven‚Äôt found evidence less severe strains virus currently exist (there mutation occurred Europe February seems made somewhat transmissible though). fortunately reason expect deadlier mutation necessarily arrive, even did, realize mutation would impact one person contacts. isolate chain transmission, would people obvious cases, deadlier version (again, won‚Äôt even necessarily occur) could contained.

There plenty reasons deaths Japan recently besides ‚Äúweakening virus‚Äù. Chief among long lag positive test results, death, reporting death. right better treatments addition young cohort infected people country great healthcare low rates underlying conditions could improving outcomes.

This must annoying, sorry that, overall it‚Äôs good thing. Genuine question: looking small business.... say restaurant STILL take only, spent really afford PPE employees, following guidelines, employee still gets sick (maybe work, maybe outside work) still subject law suits?

The problem blanket ‚Äúheld accountable‚Äù ‚Äúnot accountable‚Äù right answer. yet, unfortunately, government isn‚Äôt willing take time decipher difference.

You say businesses held responsible plenty accused everything could keep employees customers safe. subject every Karen refused follow precautions decided mom pop shop caused get sick?

Major cities? don‚Äôt really know vaccines disbursed aside extremely likely frontline first. makes difference depending one‚Äôs circumstances. angry, pro-mask pregnant woman. problem helping Kroger workers vocally enforce mask wearing local store. links?  face greatly pissing off. 
I work grocery store managers confront people wearing mask declare ""medical condition"", even though typically day prior causing fuss, managers always go ""Welp! Thats it, cant nothin, better bother again."" 

So moral low comes management right really hope employees realize importance right health refuse service. new kind antibody test? current one useless ü§® saying try get COVID?

It's like everyone forgot deadly highly contagious going around infecting people, hype died back staying indoors wearing masks. horror... little thing called science. lol don‚Äôt try talk sense psychos they‚Äôre like little death cult. title makes look another vaccine. reality article vaccine chiefly developed Gamaleya research center finished phase 1 trials recently.

They want us dead.

Articles nowdays remind Onion.... T-Cell memory means immunity confers long period time

To expand ""long period time"": T-cell presence SARS-1 found persist least 17 years. 17? That's long since SARS-1 happened. We've yet determine upper limit SARS-1 T-cell persistence. if, appears, cross-immunity T-cells SARS-1 SARS-2, hopeful sign long term COVID-19 immunity (or least greatly reduced severity upon reinfection). Yeah good point Oh wait 30m+ work decide something homeless starving. Well, outside getting covid there's way stay home safe.  Yeah total faith seat danger. denying I've witnessed Trump maybe need minor surgery, ten days procedure, tell want COVID test. haven‚Äôt actually said *which* kind test want presume swab/PCR, digress. start calling around schedule test everyone tells ‚ÄúSorry, labs taking two weeks get results back‚Äù Lol joke ?? we‚Äôre screwed then... guy closed state 2-3 weeks late claimed learned last 24 hours asymptomatic people could spread virus. everyone else knew 4 weeks prior. also one first rush reopen. made announcement going reopen mere hours price oil per barrel went negative first time history. either complete moron he's (and orange overlord) gaining financially situation. Sad. lock nursing home hospital down, it‚Äôs harder control employees outside work. Also staff may everything right household contacts working higher risk areas participating risky activities. It‚Äôs messy situation. several Michigan, live. don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen outside state Phase 2 complete, phase 3 started least 3 different countries Insane flat evil. decision cost lives many Georgia residents. they're saying things think true mean they're lying. [Test positivity rate also currently 2.43% became one unemployed finding shitty social safety nets are, especially since getting additional aid outside standard unemployment. I'm tempted live truck roof top tent mountains. without lockdown... Darn, whole Asia danger since February! soooo trouble!


/s obvious way prove that. science can't trust anything proven. proven can't used simple that. misinformation I've witnessed big scale Trump Belgium still top population statistics it‚Äôs talked much about. ""I think start see spread social situations people let guard down. Usually like private party something like that."" 

Maybe merge private parties together stop private everyone immediately become completely safe virus. Yes lied masks short supply, admission. Can‚Äôt complain people don‚Äôt trust opinion. hopes prayers again. ""Hey babe, put STD 'stud' need 'U.'"" 30k people attended NASCAR race last night wearing masks say that‚Äôs no. probably going cheaper insure, too. like trap release? Thats illegal state rabies parasites spreading. Besides trap release racoon racoons area release new one kill it. shareholders‚Äô bank account... Imagine March Trump released ""MAGA"" branded mask, I'd even tolerate outrageous boasts racism he'd say ""best masks"" ""no masks keep China Flu away lie his"" followers would wear them. restaurants become eateries? mean go shitterie. commute drivery. 

Not much article. Basically it.

 ""He (Stitt) visited establishment last week want proactive shut get staff tested get restaurant professionally disinfected,"" restaurant [**posted   stores 4 fucking months ago.  Yes, much thing. Aside getting giant pile mucus face. end result virus particles go whatever protective barrier wearing. face shield would work better, would still present problems. keep people great enough distance away you, viral load floats air around you.

Hazmat suit would work. (Yes, sounds ridiculous, need enclosed suit/system cases prevent spread). scientific evidence. doctor knows mask help prevent spread contagious respiratory virus.

He admitted levels equipment available. chose discredit masks falsely attempt keep PPE hospitals.

It backfired them, big time.

I really like Fauci ok point everyone else made big mistake beginning. one perfect. Well population sizes different. Although every life lost tragic. point US essentially going herd immunity without making official? open tourists EU... Spain's problem outbreak mainly Madrid bad time, rest country hardly cases.

The spikes cases places untouched, Madrid seeing increase, likely partial herd immunity there. distribution networks place, delay based politicians bureaucrats giving approval. We're waiting virus take government new blood get actually something correctly ever evolving Idiocracy shitshow. PA HUGE number long term care facilities retirement communities got caught hammered beginning this. Montgomery County, PA, deaths LTC facilities around 2/3 total deaths. Hey, sister also ICU physician. chief resident anesthesia top US hospital NYC weeks ago, moved LA start fellowship. highest risk exposure months now, she‚Äôs accessing airways intubate patients put ventilators. hospital young docs covering older ones higher risk demographics. point, patients ICU started include older doctors department.

A couple weeks ago, antibody test. negative. *shocked*. guess PPE works, used correctly? heart goes SO, point isn‚Äôt foregone conclusion. hope best guys üíñ That's funny. wear mask working everyday totally fine  age 60+ die get seriously ill &lt;60 stay healthy despite virus.

Think stages. simplyfied example:

60+ serious cases ICU + death

50-60 serious cases ICU + serious cases without ICU

40-50 serious cases without ICU + mild cases enough sick leave

30-40 mild cases enough sick leave + mild cases

0-30 mild cases 

If majority workforce 30+ sick can't work hospitals overwhelmed get treatment disease gets worse certain economy crumble much worse lockdown 2-4 months prevent spread. Due lack action several states lockdown 6 months might needed.

By preventing spread hospitals get overwhelmed, local clusters instead many hotspots cities affected meaning economy works time again.

Think way: farmers meat processors sick work goes food reserves produce food anymore. lockdown affects reserves months. issues remain since start pandemic, read carefully understand present conspiracy, historical option-fact framed conservative mindset--if want understand people fighting this, need understand perspective:

One) 

Not enough proof hoax:

In early days, political sides called hoax. idea still lingers many minds. difficult unlearn something trusted sources represent mind. Especially hospital boat work out, cleared offices used, 6% dead non selective age sweep youth. morgues filled corpses? videos celebrities coughing? zoomers making Tiktok threads dying hospitals? Oh right. exist. Pretty easy read lines realize contentious issue. many actually (I care redditors) known someone disease die it? 1% population overall far. Scary, know. 

Two)

True form, hypocritical leftist regime useful idiots swing ""stay fuck home"" screeching trump rallies protests, supporting literally black rioting month. difficult take something seriously enemy (perceived real) acts accordance expectations ""degeneracy"" can't even put hypocrisy quotes, is. 

Three) 

Shilling. Internet astroturfing. Manipulation. Propaganda. Fake news. comes bare sides, top bottom up. fucked. Social media allows run rampant. Look place /r/covid19positive ""my hair fell out"" threads ""teehee never got tested haha"". Look sample size ten men Wuhan hospitals used scare mongering titles. Look ""masks kill save"" head lines. Every way try cut beast, bites. 

Four) 

Insufferable ideological dogma reigns Supreme. goes religious, ""I'm covered blood, need shut church"". ""A mask compassion. Together saving lives even one life lost much! Shut everything !!! (Then watch riot outside random shit)"". ""I'm wearing mask sharia law God hates it"" VS ""I literally call police state license plates"". 


All together, unsure science serious political implications far closely associated Bolshevik French revolution billion heirs international domestic criminal enterprises using material wealth manipulate this, surprise are. know why, physical distancing synonymous social distancing. Physical distancing ""proper term."" pedantic, misinterpreted social distancing related ""social distance."" understanding difference ""distance"" ""distancing"" makes clear phrases mean. yeah respect other. drinking enough day? I've noticed I'm much less likely take sip water requires finding empty spot taking mask first. Responsibility cheap, otherwise many misuse it. Besides, humane ways deal critters farm. everything involve shooting. dystopia, normality civilized countries comes owning guns. N95s useful cloth masks surgical masks different story. way many many healthcare workers caught unfortunately. healthcare workers using N95s right now. 

Cloth surgical masks keep droplets virus uses vector transmission decreases potential viral load important possibility infection. Wow, that‚Äôs awesome. once, I‚Äôm impressed Walmart. son working one summer, I‚Äôm pretty happy new changes going effect! European Japanese English articles use local currencies metric units measurement need make conversion imperial USD anyways

Nobody talking currencies. measurement units, far people Reddit understand feet verses cror. absolute numbers, far Chinese people anyone else world. see people going around using Chinese units like ""jin"" place?  Three words never heard put together before:  Pro Plague Protest sure MontCo northern part County, consistently 95%+ compliance masks. local Giant Foods amazing well enforced rules, too. Sooooo, opening relaxing measures negative effect.

I shocked tell you, SHOCKED! target security stands door let wearing mask. still can't believe 4 months inter-state travel still shut national level. easily could written exceptions shipping, etc., completely shut March.  God, article.

America's population large would take quite time substantial amount people (percentage wise) get infected. 100k cases per day=0.0305%(0.00035 1) population get infected per day  Convenient day white house gets numbers instead CDC...I wonder is? excuse, make cloth mask matter hour. Re-usedable Downvote I‚Äôm wrong, feel like quite states Northeast pretty well. Like Vermont. happening Maine? attitude America beat thing long time. moderate right friend said NY CA dropped ball fight COVID, resulted US's current state. true states currently higher death infection rates, WAY densely populated TX FL others, besides, fat lady sung yet. Let's see months. guess is, TX FL walking nightmares, I'm proud Floridian proud Texan years ago. Republicans become pro-choice. live Illinois, able decrease number new active cases considerably since peaked May. started going back office regularly mid-June things looking quite positive. take public transportation, wear mask anytime public. also washing hands using hand sanitizer great frequency. dined restaurant gone bar even though opened state end June. starting see increase cases state, seems likely may shut continues go up.

I see what's happening rest country truly disheartened. seems like half country took seriously. people quarantined, socially distanced, wore masks, etc. half never took seriously. refused change life way, including simple thing wearing mask public space. selfish people making sacrifices responsible people made count nothing. worse ever been. see countries responsible us steadily driving numbers recovering economies. look US seems hopeless. many politicians care people serve. many people care comfort. We're doomed.

Increasingly seem completely unequipped deal pandemic country, downfall. think future country bright I've started look way out. Whether Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, think need find new home. values values fellow countrymen align, never less proud American.

Practically speaking, gotten sick, family friends gotten COVID. Luckily nobody close died yet, lost acquaintances friends lost family members.

I'm somewhat dark place. scared, anxious, depressed, increasingly losing hope.

In future, think it‚Äôs important stay subs like push much false information focus actual scientific sources. It‚Äôs country thing. google find list kroger subsidiaries near you.  Maybe start educating adults kids.  I'm Texas go New Mexico almost every year. love state, love much I'm coming year. I'm sorry going on.

Precisely point anyone link GoFundMe Karen started herself? I'm interested see outcome that.  Putin intended. Wear mask. Stop spread. Economy regains steam. Kids go back school. Trump wins election.

It's strange republicans everything power make go away. Instead, conservatives acting like wearing mask admitting problem/pandemic. can't understand denying existence sickness effecting daily life last 4 months path white house.. Indeed! gets worse! 

A lot people across professions chosen show work number weeks well!

I sure planning something sinister. dumbest thing. Muh gubernatorial powers shall infringed! Soar 67. only. Crying American. Elect stupid leaders, win stupid prizes. Shit right. Sorry brain fried. literally live around block guy. Lol. country is

Brazil is. guess cow urine work all. would known... HHS? never heard before. guess whatever Trump tells Jesus that's accurate description. :( It‚Äôs easy, student gets sick, quarantine... friends, teachers, janitors, administrators may contact building spend 8 hours together.

But kids really super open honest spending time also known scrupulously follow regulations authority. Teenagers especially never known break rules flout authority. cute girl algebra wants make behind school, super cute boy Spanish wants walk locker end one hallway one right now, teenagers would never let hormones get better take masks off, right?

So case takes student, probably teacher, friends, janitor, administrators came contact student. Fortunately, American schools world renowned low student teacher ratio, educator sidelined two weeks dying virus create kind strain underfunded understaffed system.

Also it‚Äôs well-known fact young children teens alike living independently homes don‚Äôt present exposure risk parents, grandparents, siblings. 

I mean, must true, else plan reopen schools midst pandemic would madness. America, day born, American politicians shouted face ‚Äúthe best‚Äù ‚Äúexceptional‚Äù ‚Äú#1‚Äù. Would politician lie me? ambiguous best. example, mention new ""cases"", ""new infections"", possibly indicating talking recording info biological reality. 

anyway, agree RECORDING official release death numbers take long, long, long time, right? I'll agree people die COVID less 6 weeks getting infected, although outliers take people multiple months. irony complain freedom COVID ones prevent us freedom. complain able live normally ones delaying us going back live normally. probably talk like he's five-year-old want eat vegetables (beans).... see anyone half brain saying meaning Lol

Lehtonen criticizes view THL director Mika Salminen would difficult prevent clusters guest workers.

The otherwise peaceful coronavirus situation darkened recent weeks clusters infections, especially among migrant workers. Monday, Mika Salminen, Director Health Safety Department National Institute Health Welfare (THL), said interview HS risk known, clusters disease cannot completely avoided.

‚ÄúWhen Finland opens up, get used fact epidemic clusters coming. quite difficult completely prevent. Otherwise, everything closed,‚Äù Salminen said.

Read : [""When Finland opens up, get used fact epidemic clusters coming,"" says THL's Mika Salminen infections among foreign workers]( answer valid Lasse Lehtonen, Husin's director diagnostics Helsinki Uusimaa hospital districts . 
""It interesting THL still considers corona infection clusters brought Finland foreign workers 'given', dare develop measures even reduce epidemic risk regard,"" Lehtonen commented Twitter.

According Lehtonen, Finland done almost everything possible stop disease.

‚ÄúSometimes there‚Äôs feeling letting things happen building system could minimize possibility second wave,‚Äù tells HS.

‚ÄúTHL thumb ministry time, reproaches immediately proposals own. also seen CEO THL suggested use masks. find problematic experts cannot express views.‚Äù

With risk reduction measures, Lehtonen says means testing foreign workers especially coronavirus. workers come ground, testing tracing infection chains begins someone gets sick.

According government THL, important thing find isolate disease chains spread widely. Lehtonen also favor testing come work high-risk countries, either airport even coming Finland.

‚ÄúHus management already proposed testing government airport, implemented. technology there. question whether want to.‚Äù

For example, Hus already performs PCR rapid test patients come hospital, results obtained couple hours.

According Lehtonen, foreign workers limited, relatively small group people. example, shipyard workers, agricultural workers construction workers come Finland. According Lehtonen, tests would useful, even done couple days coming Finland. infections would left wounds [found], risk would reduced.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking maximum thousand people here. Testing shouldn‚Äôt hard,‚Äù says.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt even terrible cost issue. would cost health check often required exchange students. ‚Äù

Changes border control may known. Monday, Prime Minister's Office announced would set working group coordinate fight corona epidemic border crossing points. However, coronavirus tests mentioned release.

According Pekka Tulokka , chairman working group, Ministry Social Affairs Health , establishment working group still infancy, specific measures yet discussed.

‚ÄúThe intention one step ahead new measures needed borders, readiness so,‚Äù says Tulokas.

According Lehtonen, Finland improve preparedness, especially regard future traffic Russia Sweden. Restrictions direction EU's neighbor Sweden may difficult make, Lehtonen thinks, least eastern border hopes mandatory testing.

""We still decide ourselves. Finland awkward position two large epidemic areas. clear plan fall, good month go.‚Äù seeing positive Swedens approach. Recent articles seem say think close immunity... example 10% infected Stockholm worst affected city one research secret? Florida exceeded total UK cases when, daily cases still flattening out. UK daily cases peaked almost three months ago.

This study covers people died *testing positive*. thousands people died without ever tested. Italy, 34,997 official covid deaths, 45,000 excess deaths first four months year (also ISTAT study).

Real ad. people really voted it. also helpfully campaigned platform rounding illegals sending back came from. Also state stupid. odd say already 2 trailers operational, another 3 way.

Someone pinch me, must dreaming. *makes sense* hey since Swedes apparently follow government‚Äôs recommendations letter, means Swedes obey right? Yeah, no, maybe will. 

This makes sense it‚Äôd really bad idea set situation there‚Äôs possibility infections Denmark start traced back Sweden. could make situation like Finnish / Swedish one, wherein Finns set low allowed cases per capita (8 / 100k) seem Nordic country reluctant reopen Swden. almost certainly partially due Finland experiencing exported cases Sweden date (areas border Sweden actually [more infections per capita]( even capital region Helsinki). I'm asking entirely good faith sincerity, achieved 'conversions'? leave. I‚Äôd argue spend free time. work 8 hours day really gets way frivolous spending IMO. finally start learning China.

After bit shaky (and least outside deeply confusing) start, Finland exceptionally well terms COVID response. Test, Trace, Isolate plan already caught lot cluster infections (many [traced back Sweden]( ) seems working well. It‚Äôs good news strengthening further. 

Actually, despite poor start would almost say strongest position going forward since seems made significant attempts shore TTI *and* it‚Äôs set threshold opening borders given country rather low: 8/100k vs. 20/100k Denmark Norway.

Wait, somehow think character flaw parents? dumb shift workers get better paying job flexible schedule, natch. Correct I'm wrong seeing says data (which disappeared CDC site earlier) back now. see anything says hospitals required supply numbers instead HHS. fact earlier explicitly allowed share CDC.

I see changed.

In fact CNN article says data updated past July 14. CDC also added language website saying data would updated past July 14.

So (from tell) put existing data back up. Going forward data still go HHS CDC knows happen we'll see it. Unbelievable. said reduces transmission. means works. think willfully ignorant.

But gullible plandemic believers willful ignorance best practices others caused massive spikes accelerating June mid July. took 7 N H  Yeah wonder many people read OP posted source comments. point says ""decision reversed"" anything remotely like that.

This right here. He's fixers cook books long that's go to. Must frustrating cook way Unless I'm missing something, mistaken. CDC put dashboards back website, change reporting procedures reversed. data still going white house instead CDC.  #This title outright lie.

How post manage get 400 upvotes, 99% upvoted, tons celebratory comments?
Did one actually read [the op posting justify title? browse around CDC site see what's top site CDC wrote, ‚ÄúDashboards last updated July 14, 2020,‚Äù included link guidance HHS tells hospitals stop reporting data CDC. CDC site also notes, ‚ÄúIMPORTANT: Data displayed page submitted directly CDC‚Äôs National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) include data submitted entities contracted within federal government.‚Äù

You see [CDC They're getting new data directly. data that's ""restored"" outdated. updates, happens, filtered HHS. decision hospitals report data HHS, rather CDC, reversed.

I really, really hope US gets situation sorted soon. many innocent people suffering due actions incompetence few. CoViD HoAx







/s lot talk - think it‚Äôs inevitable point. ones wearing masks, etc. Yeah really hard tell really things perfectly fine weeks... went Sprouts today told woman front us put mask wasn‚Äôt wearing one. Turns mask purse guess didn‚Äôt want wear it? Either way first time I‚Äôve somewhere masks required can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs starting happen six months pandemic.... Stores routinely law enforcement remove trespassers. different. Can't really blame them. Corporate cut hazard pay May 16th. lot workers see ""if there's hazard pay, there's hazard"" properly wear mask sort fight back corporate. cut hazard pay, many people stepped said they'd stop shopping Kroger got brought back. Within week, everyone employees forgot way really push back lack hazard pay. all, last major grocery chain receive it, first cut off.

Should probably add source myself. I've worked company years now. Personally wear mask, seen many people wearing reason given above. Still going  Omg wish company would something like make employees keep masks on. certain giant retailer online persuasion. CT requires masks almost every business. However something guidelines says people ""medical condition"" required wear masks. I've seen arguments stores employees/customers, IMO using ""loophole"". seemed like customers baiting asked leave ""Medical condition"", since can't ask wrong. businesses recourse situation like this? Since privately owned, able enforce it? Several reasons.

1) Testing better. catching far mild cases back when. Antibody tests show 10% NY States (2 million) 20-30% NYC already infected. talk New Yorkers got sick March, getting test reserved people severe symptoms high risk group. could easily actual infection count 100,000-140,000 per day period.

2) Nursing homes huge killers. Many voluntarily quarantined increased caution.

3) gotten better treating it. Ventilators seen super important back March, really ended delaying deaths people since 70-80% people end one die. There's medications treatments help decrease chance dying good amount. course means nothing hospitals get overwhelmed use supplies fast rate. happening. Arizona send patients state since room. Texas Florida also shuffling people around State.

4) Deaths lag course. seen rises many States 3/7 day averages deaths increased Arizona, Florida, Texas California.

5) Southern States, especially Florida Texas transparent data. Florida refused release hospitalization numbers, they've labeling tons deaths pneumonia, they're testing counting deaths people died home outside hospitals, meanwhile New York New Jersey added probable home deaths counts. 12,235 cases 154 deaths according worldometer. Sometimes even doctor tells it, still think it‚Äôs hoax. Checking like wanted. posted 15th...and today first day Texas started storing bodies cold trucks morgues overwhelmed. Looks like ride again, still. Whichever :(  think it, probably manipulate data. way claim ""see... CDC lying you"". either start slowing data release. Numbers get reported, get access 3 weeks later. Slows media cycle bit, let's claim ""sure, bad 3 weeks ago, see good things now, virus disappearing"". 3 weeks that's proven lie reply ""that's said"" despite video proof.

You know... standard operating procedure last 3 1/2 years. End result??? Covid actually different. thread worth reading. can‚Äôt find now.. also read NPR article yesterday saying cases covid children adults rare. 

Also, study done medical college US linking covid certain levels fat sugar blood, apparently rare children, could one contributing factor it‚Äôs different children.

That twitter link article linked children actually don‚Äôt spread covid like flu. maybe common sense doesn‚Äôt prevail. Agreed, employer's short-sightedness could get entire company (or large part it) sick they're 100x fucked. Damn, highly interesting!! It‚Äôs easy add beds even equipment...you also need staff beds. ICU beds need staff, ratios change. staff dying short supply run trouble. right, sorry that! get wear mask even believed stop spread much. Even cover ass decrease odds getting it. 

And fuck would government even use masks control you? piece cloth paper hides identity extent, like opposite gov would want wanted ""control"" you.

(Central jersey) People employees call tell people leave they‚Äôre wearing mask. bull shit here! It‚Äôs nice. 

Now everyone would cover nose mask... hoping it‚Äôs less half  Bingo.

The anti-maskers noisy minority. Every business require wearing masks/social distancing (responsible) majority feel safe go there, win terms public health economically. local PD said enforce mask policy implemented county.

So that's thing

They said call us call health department Yeah, never trusted guy. Lots work bouncers. I'm sure could use cash flow I'm ready asteroid slam us. deserve leech planet anymore. I'm ready. Let's go guys.  Wear fucking mask, stay fuck home. 
 
If condition doesn‚Äôt let wear mask, stay home. Amazing governors (DeSantis/Kemp) make Gov. Abbott look great job.

That's pathetic. No, absolutely dumb. studied epidemiological occurrence relation pandemics novel viruses. science. weird, Canada beat, man shot death police today mask dispute, assaulting store employees ramming building truck. told can't come without mask. fucking *mask* guy wound armed standoff cops killed. 

Boggles mind. testing. number cases NYs peak estimated 10 times recorded number missed lot cases lots people infected mild symptoms.

As test throughout US get closer real number. believed number postive still accurate today since people still can't get tested testing results delayed.

There also statistics average age lower now. control nursing homes older/vulnerable population taking precuations. younger people infected lower death rate.

Lastly, new thearaputics, catching cases earlier, treatment protocol, causing lower death rates. Can‚Äôt wait Karen videos come this. ‚ÄòTwas simpler time. thanks ate. USA #1!! Yep. certain point look people say ‚ÄúYou deserve fate.‚Äù walk away. Note: According Worldometers, 50 states Washington D.C. reported number cases today. Coronavirus naturally occurring Wuhan China region. Going back first big SARs cases.

The lab believe simple human screw ups like mistake protocol could release.

Ebola endemic certain regions Africa. almost oops Marburg onto Dulles USAMRID operated monkey house.

For know Marburg mildly less lethal mortality rate 60 percent. üò¨

We need spy v spy situation humans involved. Sar-cov-2 vs h1n1.. that's interesting one. Scov2 likely better virus due fact stays dormant infectious much longer survivability. H1n1 kills far quicker higher mortality rate (I like 5 7%).  Scaled population world 1918 1.7billion .7% mortality rate fatality count covid19 would around 11million assuming medical system fatally collapse infected 95+%. also believe h1n1 virus 2008 similar 1918 strain killed roughly 12k us. 2015 pelvic exam certification? üòÇ

One way look numbers consider many days diagnosis death.

I hate two sides every issue now. life-saving measure relatively convenient scientific consensus behind it, government able mandate done. least, right considered real state emergency drastic, unilateral action taken. I'm talking BS state emergency Trump declared border wall (which, way, still effect July 2020). record unemployment, 100,000 people dead already, control spread virus. biggest domestic emergency lifetimes. ever time allow executive action protect American lives, now. can't fix stupid... must localized, Ottawa Walmart never guard. that, virus wins.

Thank you! That's really disappointing, hope stopped asked wear one get people put one on. think policy least protect people genuinely medical issue stops wearing one... know many people abuse get protecting people something simple putting mask on. still work do, NY state 13%, NYC 22%, Bronx 33%. also without schools. Half billion incredibly unlikely. 

As right many populous, urban nations things less control. Much Eastern Asia controlled, Europe good place, Canada/Australia/New Zealand good ways. Even US, Northeast managed get past first wave good job keeping numbers despite outbreaks south west them. 

There concerns could run rampant South America, Africa, central Asia, India/Pakistan, many countries trying take whatever measures manage get things control. 

Many places might saved largely outdoors time disease spread badly, younger populations average, rural, limited medical systems could prove problematic. 

However, spite that, half billion deaths nearly impossible. Many large population centers control, beyond fatality rate low enough even whole Earth got it, might well reach half billion deaths. would 13% mortality even places struggling medical systems old populations mortality estimates come anywhere near rate. Orrrr hardest-hit areas took preventative measures heart working harder prevent spread since then. Well, guess we'll get test case Florida compare couple months.

The model estimates 43% threshold herd immunity, nowhere even close to. Barring 43% miraculously composed primarily 5-50 year-olds, that's still going \~1.4 million dead Americans end pandemic, many times chronic conditions, potential effects letting virus run rampant population. tapes must amusing f*ck... East/Southeast Asia seem covid control. Europe, Middle East, Americas except US Brazil. enough countries participate safely hold Olympics. Exactly, many morgues equipped handle infectious bodies? I'm NC family there, definitely worrying truly feel sorry American people. country run monsters truly care citizens lives. Ummmmm .. welll America are.... ummmmm.... seeee... nm There's difference stupid mean dumb. Please use example. Mmm that's true too. mean understand process used invest heavily biotechnology stocks.

Descending third world shit hole. saw InfoWars video used device read Co2 levels justify wearing mask good health. Ironic, sell info war printed face masks. Idiots. Yep, welcome hell created Cruise ships bet.  Can't both? Especially Texas, Florida... yet evidence culture one champions ignorance, ignores facts, figure, outright reality. point, even Fox News knows bad is. 

Come people! Gotta maintain supply wage slaves overlords. least robots AI become available. 2,977 people died 9/11 attacks, least [according 9/11 today, 32.8% 9/11.  get 9/11 worth death would need take

Today (977)

\+ Yesterday (935) = 1,912

\+ Monday (464) = 2,376

\+ Sunday (380) = 2,756

\+ Saturday (731) = 3,487

So 9/11 worth death every 3-5 days (depending trends).

I realize first might come downplaying death toll, intended damning.

The CDC revised Fatality Ratio recently 0.65%, way think realized 977 deaths today also banked 71,670 \* 0.65% = \~465 deaths future. catch once, cases appearing happen, time suffer permanent vascular damage, probable.

Could years roll by, survive successive cases we'll weakened succumb? 
 
Don't forget wave passes, lose medical expertise doctors nurses exposed ridiculous levels.

The CDC telling anyone shut down. CDC guidelines are, wash hands regularly, touch face, mouth, eyes, maintain social distancing.

Shut media thing. Based evidence data CDC mortality rate C19 warrant response give it. transmission rate impressive, wear mask whenever appropriate. live fear based asshole FOX, NBC, ABC, CNN That's really good news.

With masks proven close 100% effective, seems social distance really needed much (can't social distance getting haircut) long everyone responsible wears mask, society resume.

The way see it, masks condoms. There's thing 100% safe condom extremely dumb use extremely dumb avoid sex they're 100% safe.

Wear mask, responsible, live life fullest. 6 months late. Like everything US divisions Kroger ""Customer Engagement Specialists"" stand doors watch people come go.

Medcram (Dr Seheult) previously discussed papers ivermectin.

In latest video discusses another methanism June 1 paper David Scheim US Public Health Service proposed - Ivermectin may inhibit attachment covid19 spike protein ACE2 receptors well CD147 red blood cells.

This June 1 paper proposed covid19 spike protein attaching RBCs may causing RBCs stick - so-called ""catch clump"" process (which may possible reason anecdotal ""thick blood"" reported).

Here notes took listening video:

He says paper suggests another mode action ivermectin

CD147 protein red blood cell

RBCs found blood clots
as well thrombin fibrin etc. (?)

CD147 entry point malaria red blood cell


CD147 also considered possible binding site covid19 spike protein

so like ACE2 receptors

however help virus enter RBCs nucleus RBCs

and nucleus, doesnt need ribosomes RBCs since protein synthesis occuring

if protein synthesis occurring, RBCs kind dead end

as virus cannot reproduce RBCs lack machinery virus reproduce ..


however theory goes virus binds CD147 tends make cells sticky

and cause thrombosis .. that's article suggests

article says behavior seen malaria - CD147 similarly ..

saying ivermectin shields covid19 spike protein


and ivermectin prevents happening

(has ivermectin studied malaria ?)


also potentially prevents spike protein binding ACE2 receptor

however huge number CD147 - article hypothesizes ""catch clump"" framework

ie virally mediated binding RBCs RBCs ..

Seems like really terrible tell truth. stop rationalizing this.

No didn't, maybe explain this. see they've deleted? 

I neither time inclination explain Reddit works. Maybe learn services using. employee, ask consider challenging wear mask 8 hours become overheated trying work quickly. take mask entirely go walk-in freezer (otherwise breath condensates mask makes damp useless) sometimes bakery ovens gets quite hot need take 30 second mask breaks able go hide back sinks so, whereas floor workers nowhere go hide quick breather. ALWAYS pull back cover entire face interacting customer. behalf co-workers, I'm sorry wear 100% compliance 100% time. completely understand discouraging/upsetting spot 1, 2, 5+ employees row wearing properly. gives bad perception sure. can't speak everyone care customer's safety well own. Alegedly, Texas mandate already, employee told say anything customers, report manager. manager supposed spend day running around making sure everyone wearing mask, top job. live TN guys ridiculous  Walmart post tagged 'world' 

o_O lists germany 59%. 

You asked (by police necessary) leave public building try enter without mask, think I've seen anyone without mask inside shop public building matter. Poor Hong Kong can‚Äôt seem catch break. tomorrow? know takes 5 14 days show ideas like waiting week start it. know? Honestly never heard these, live northern Alabama (unfortunately) looks tight, start trials. Though hesitant believing anything already have, case ‚Äúcommon‚Äù blood thinner, really make much dent novel virus. Wishful thinking hurt us thus far, look interesting. viable vaccine, ‚Äúcocktail‚Äù approach best bet treatment.

I say recognition Covid blood-type disease continues disturb me. HIV/AIDS comps something spread easily via respiratory droplets, particularly noted types treatments suggested...man. Guess learning anything virus helpful tho. first two cases HK confirmed 23 Jan; first case Chinese traveler arrived HK second case traveled Wuhan one week earlier likely get infected there. Unless Chinese Hong Kong government involved huge coverup (i.e. COVID outbreak occurred much earlier HK), otherwise unlikely catch COVID HK late Dec early Jan. Meanwhile South Africa...our schools open everyday kids teachers getting infected. One school 200 children teachers infected virus. Parents teachers angry situation do? already stated can‚Äôt allow schools open peak clearly government stubborn. LOL Well say smart don‚Äôt breed imma let Darwin sort out. still remember Fauci telling people buy masks... saw video youtube antimaskers give speech

Infected people appear US, still trace US infected back person China recently. long that, community transmission happened. start getting infected, can't seem trace back known infection source, community transmission virus. Hi! 
Anyone knows good site keeping eye active cases around Lago Di garda, Italy?

Thanks advance! hard implement US absolute no-brainer EU? truly amazes :/ ‚ÄúNo shoes, shirt, mask, service.‚Äù



Or, would abbreviate Wallmart: ‚ÄúNo mask, service.‚Äù Ahhhh, corporate greed Less people would get infected via transport cars plane full people cougher covid-19 opinion. Also 40+ hour drive San Diego Boston lot longer 8 hour plane flight would encourage people stay home Damn, thought 7-10 days bad. Nurse practitioner apologized saying long wait July 4th....


Yeah, started spiking right July 4th. scam. media trying terrify us fucking time.. Arizona, one wears one either Walmart Market Frys(Kroger). Karen? Kills lot 1 1,000 may dude. black death, common flu either. read that? cases single figures daily, weekly. think 5 new cases yesterday game real consequences like life someone knows nothing respiratory issues. 

what kind respiratory issue bad still about, mask pushes brink able breathe? Trump would alienate followers mandated masks. Won‚Äôt happen. close elections. Thanks info! Georgia doubling time 23 days, New York doubling time 384 days.  Seriously take fraction second really think statement contradicts itself. order avoid complete shutdown EVERYONE wear mask cut transmission. hard concept? Look what‚Äôs happening Houston - load dead refrigerated trucks morgues full. Yeah I‚Äôm sure economy booming there. 

It time stop listening uneducated dangerously misleading opinions politicians start listening medical professionals know talking about. underestimate kind monster is. someone works starting strict this. even work overnight, store closed, there‚Äôs ten us working masks on, enforced open hours.h Fertility rates already replacement level every western country years. New wave Karen wont wear mask vidz coming  That's point, want make even worse letting people countries let spread freely. must conservative. Thank you, I‚Äôve training years. China test fertility months back feared thing may occuring? get holy shit yes idiots, nobody wears masks anywhere. even hospitals mandatory weeks back, peak! country joke Got eem  tristate area here, trying dick, knew coming. saw happening Italy one cared hit us here. good job flattening curve, acknowledge population density, don‚Äôt think anyone country is/was exempt ‚Äúnot knowing‚Äù coming. Like said, example Italy. realize could actually shut got bad, shut sooner, wonder much different result would gotten. There‚Äôs lot moving pieces people don‚Äôt realize. that‚Äôs two cents convo. Stay safe! saying awhile now, believe maliciousness going here. really hard believe many officials making mistakes often clearly informed decisions. 

Their choice money lives. Almost everyone working every day little stocks, stock market booming little help them. helps gov officials, rich, companies already got massive bailouts.

Another thing, one biggest issues government faced medium term collapse social security. virus actually solves problem go herd immunity. Almost everyone collecting social security extreme danger zone virus. government basically saying, meh, screw them, get back work look good 1%.

Every day concerned government, sides, give two flips many us die. long power, pockets lined, families safe.

I really interested see far pushed rioting starts again. treating us like trash. really, power even have? pretty sure vast majority nation super happy things going here. Knowing americans focus findingt solution involve ""if"". $600 week roughly make regularly I'm nowhere near minimum wage. give bunch people struggling make ends meet money they're used to, course they're going finally buy things never could before. don‚Äôt help healthcare workers gone months without catching it? ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really fully understand it‚Äù

I love keeps calling playing dumb. course Fauci knows it‚Äôs politics election crap, acts like he‚Äôs unaware Trump‚Äôs trying pick fight. doesn‚Äôt engage, thus neutralizing side. then, space essentially respond ‚Äúwtf assholes - let‚Äôs fight real enemy here, k?‚Äù right thing time. far people Reddit understands pound feet are, people understand cror is. page offers information various conditions prevent compliance mandatory mask policies; particularly section titled ""Examples person disability might able wear face mask."" hope helps. I‚Äôm not. Ever play pandemic? game learns virus vaccine started shit ends game pretty damn quick. 

Though guess case, world playing pandemic easy mode world leaders people ignorant fuck virus. NZ's population urban plenty international travel. US currently worse India...

I remember US made achievements rather excuses. decision entire task force information time. gather evidence scientific opinion changes. 38 sample size pretty small. would wait data preaching guaranteed side effect.

Good thing dumbasses volunteering check true, people avoiding informed. always follow safety precautions, even moments miss people want see them. social distance visit? Stay outside wear masks? guys probably ok... baby coming weeks I‚Äôve isolated older kids months. sucks, never truly know people they‚Äôre doing. truly sorry worry. know feel bad. would vocal irresponsible behaviors report health department going places possibly covid +, partner say something. course do! like see medical group support fauci supports Trump.  trump taking control data, US soon 0 cases mortality rate -10%  Tremendous job Nah call fear mongering. Bill Nye tried Climate change failed. Anti science folks find every excuse anti science anti rational.

It‚Äôs don‚Äôt enough evidence. result science politicized led anti science leader. Imagine moment, governor said n-word publicly. much pressure resign? see pressure right now? that? 

One plausible reason that, people Florida unhappy governor, still lot people indifferent, even supportive actions reopen economy. balance media one looks sides issue. biased media one not.  Wait... since mask restrictions shops etc. (in USA)?  Stay Dr. country needs knowledge Methanol Ethanol burn different color flame. Easiest way wait gets dark, squirt small puddle sanitizer driveway/sidewalk light it. dark though.

Ethanol (safe) burn completely blue flame. Literally 100% blue.

Methanol (UNSAFE) burn yellow flame.

Mostly ethanol little Methanol burn mostly blue flame, hints yellow.

Pure ethanol's flame blue, unmistakable. soon see it, understand.

A TINY bit yellow/orange flame tips absolutely fine - almost always trace amounts methanol ethanol, perfectly safe levels (even drinkable alcohol trace amounts methanol it). also ingredients hand sanitizer taint ethanol.

It pretty nice sanitizer, agree. Though honestly prefer 34oz bottles Walmart/Equate sanitizer Aloe.

Haha! Burrnnn! docs saw ambassadors said otherwise we'll see Murrica. don‚Äôt that‚Äôs good P100 respirator.. still 98

That true, *if* handle increased breathing resistance. Germany need take lung function test allowed use proper respirator (for work, least), assume there's reason that. allly surgical masks though. Yes, does. want call ""swim"" (strange terminology). go straight mask fibers. around. Both. shown time time again. five studies. many.
And majority N95 masks.

There's evidence masks much anything we're talking respiratory viral spread. totally relate. must incredibly stressful right American want things properly big picture working out. shut would option. You‚Äôre wrong sub. sub spreading misinformation propaganda. 

You need r/covid19 care science. It‚Äôs actually modded people actually support posts actual science. 

Here, say whatever pops head, gets upvotes supports whatever hive mind thinks day, people think made things ‚Äútrue‚Äù. Testing becoming bottleneck. Happens places prepared serious pandemic, like US. Bizarre comparison make ok Good job! Triomed going good year. Walmart supposedly hiring ""health ambassadors"" basically mask bouncers trained enforce mask rule. Perhaps scientists lie then.  Canadian here, wish built dang wall. things listed massive government programmes place prevent them, number deaths causes residual amount... think undermining trust experts right call. running phases concurrently already reached certain thresholds safety originally developing vaccine SARs/MERs (I can't remember one) UK third world wide deaths starting mask mandatory shops? like 1 1/2 months rest Europe? need demand better police. cop could tased him, pepper sprayed him, returned car called backup, chose execute spot instead. US police needs learn value life, including lives alleged criminals mentally ill people, like cops first world countries. saying anything banning protests? activity increases risk spreading covid, activity criticized. look much criticism activity BLM demonstration, compared activities. much lesser criticism simply BLM demonstration? mean hospitalization rates went down? wonder many people interpreting English classic way. country uses language proper term: physical distancing.

Why? Im Newfoundland Labrador we've restricting entry province whether thats legal (there several lawsuits pending). Ppl false sense people arent entering province lots ppl exemptions.  would say do. Personally, like running lonely places take off. Thats likely true lag time interest really positive test death complete lie. Please stop spreading misinformation. 

Now.

It‚Äôs shame. many masks put watermelon explodes? really deserve. He‚Äôs idiot needs go. like focus intelligent people office KY. did, said ""young population"" lower IFR. Except young population 25% HIV positive 25% overweight obese, figure topping 50% whole population, hospitals full, theory makes perfect sense.

Everywhere since February. We're fucked. Allow solve called ‚Äúmystery‚Äù

What‚Äôs could possibly shared pastime here?

Clue: ‚ÄúThe worlds oldest profession‚Äù That‚Äôs fallacy, that‚Äôs sad logical consequence all-powerful deity that‚Äôs responsible everything thus selling solutions problems makes. So, like then. save money using cops taxes pay also save money paying employees less benefits let taxpayer pick bill one too. knew matter time Trump unleashed hounds Dr Fauci. Fauci hope reason group. really feel bad him. He‚Äôs 80‚Äôs working hard responsibility health nation deal idiocy vindictiveness leader. Nice try! everyone knows doctors lie make ""data"" puppets big pharma! 

/s Nah 100% believes shit says, said ""character"" ""under psychosis"" interview police/FBI(I think using excuse justify delusions normal people). guy's talk shows 20 years, 6 days week.  Big states represented *compared states* represented population. sure what‚Äôs hard that. doesn‚Äôt change popular vote EC one bit like parent claiming. It‚Äôs like matters. People leave noses uncovered. I‚Äôve seen everywhere masks required. Jeebus, Mormon? someone steals vaccine lab key mentioned first sentence. true hospitals. Guess even isolation wards hospitals. Following logic would result 100% population isolation wards avoid contacts kind virus.  Pretty sure Abbott said rate got 15%, he'd take serious measures... remain telling every county enforce masks &amp; large gatherings whilst restricting much actually either. Please explain company restricting customers service based wearing communism?

You required wear shoes, shorts, shirt places asked leave. entering business allowed deny service anyone long reason covered current anti-discrimination laws. want customers wear masks like shop somewhere else. choice free citizen USA. business USA, every right require wear mask, hat, tie, whatever else want come property. You‚Äôve got general idea sure. 

But think holding something completely impermeable, like cup, mouth trying breath it. harder try pull air in, solidly you‚Äôre going seal object face prevent air entering around edges. breathe out, happens? air you‚Äôre expelling pushes way around edges cup. Masks work similar way. Don‚Äôt get wrong, masks/face coverings great job preventing droplet transmission wearer! N95 mask doesn‚Äôt better filtering air exhale surgical/procedure mask, seal compromised breath.

It seems like N95 better procedure masks, finer filtration provide air inhale it. Americans failed country. cannot blaim people believing news they're reading watching telling them. Trump encouraging idea wearing mask.

It's strange takes people personally knowing someone gotten sick realize virus real considering much misinformation spreading. Why? people watch videos phone. YouTube wasn‚Äôt busy shadow banning people they‚Äôd make UI made going vertical full mode screen intuitive Fauci secure abilities; infectious. miss movies. Summer supposed time bunch big releases come out. doubt Trudeau even knows says... downfall. work strict mask policy. 3 security personal working floor times help enforce policy. can‚Äôt believe wrote that. hell kind country America become decent needs enforced? Parson Missouri trying catch up, can't anything right. least internet paste things together. done gotta separate health related agencies politics can't plant new head gotta promote within admin can't influence directly try interfere. give power back scientist! Surprised took long local grocer required while. still pay using cash UK every shop I've says contactless card preferred It‚Äôs like high schooler complaining it‚Äôs teachers fault he‚Äôs getting D-... look mirror bud! still see define representation large states population literally represented numbers, hangup is. Americans vote carrying 3.6x weight anothers live somewhere else despite federal goverment effecting equally equal representation me. see argument balancing states better system, think claim people votes literally count less represented. state country made people call ""tiny minority"" call majority country. No. rich people caused problems ones afford self isolate. lot people getting sick option. can't dumbass.

In Savannah, mayor made mask mandatory, despite a-holes breaking it, could see positive change.

After this? I'm already seeing trash feel emboldened social media. progress gone. People going take spite.

He's like '89 Sears catalogue depiction man. REAL man, REAL leader would care protecting people appointed govern. sacrifice lives political clout. He's utterly spineless. needs make positive impressions can, big failure is. know truth works, correct? Like, gave progression virus several countries, problems pinpointing exact date people started wearing masks, right? read article

wait, that's illegal. Former PA resident, glad living Michigan Whitmer kickass job, closed bars mandated masks wearing last week so. wearing mask indoors. conditions outdoor completely different.

We also know bad ventilation system place is. back covid first started spreading. 

He found he‚Äôs positive, doesn‚Äôt think contagious Saturday. 

* Sunday OKC Walmart. 

* Tulsa restaurant closed deep cleaning, staff get tested.

* Stitt also packed funeral Tulsa late last week, hope wasn‚Äôt contagious then. 

Oklahoma did, initially, flatten curve. Unfortunately, state started opening back lack leadership wearing masks, social distancing, isolating led spike. 

Is really surprising? claims anti-vaxxer. pick choose vaccines children receive. also claims kids received vaccines required state. 

If listen responses, good reporter who‚Äôll press answers, doesn‚Äôt come much better Trump.  worry I'm killing Palestinians quite bizarre consider Fauci medical expert white house medical experts yet? matter wave define one. look graph infections later, see two peaks. That's people call waves regardless narrow definitions come wave. Nah, Walmart replaced multitude local chain stores, shoplifting concentrated single area. put police officer there? yet? Oh yeah vulnerable people take precautions? wear vest motherfucker. Wow let‚Äôs get round applause dweeb -REDDITORS, PROFESSION??!  Good luck. Stay healthy. know, I‚Äôm idiot asking final stage long take vaccine pass it? causes rabid insanity aggressive preservation spread, like fungus grows ant brains? start scanning brains starting people pulling weapons masks Another kind collateral damage. Germany reported days 50 000 cancer treatments take place Corona.

I would wonder collateral damage end ten times number Corona victims. work there? Im suprised feds even allowing flights: seems easier contain virus people couldn‚Äôt fly vaccine 30% country joined Trump Cult think wearing masks violation rights. 30% happens live prime Walmart territory... states, county's well? LA County reports numbers daily. happens, various counties need put numbers together?

This I'm glad federal state two separate entities, I'm grateful live state county mayor governor taking situation quite seriously. majority people infected young working age people ones socializing izakayas like. surprise death rate low.

Much like Singapore dorm clusters thousands young workers living together infected single death far. Ok ask: thumbnail appears article... CD acting up...  Seems like Maine N.H. way north sparsely populated get away precorona activities. Stop resistance training. That's crazy, I'm Canada havnt even hear dollar spent someone bottom social hierarchy supports exponentially people dollar spent anyone near top third hierarchy. Horrible. Imagine anyone ignorant selfish grocery store tell wear mask don‚Äôt kill anyone. also excludes lot land that's inA county that's extremely unpopulated. Seriously like 3/4 LA county area that's mountains ""LA"" desert nobody lives. health ambassador training docs say argue...  enforcing economy shrinking then? article sucks don‚Äôt understand numbers like 9,68,876 ? mean ?? 

Either way, that‚Äôs still bad country 1+ billion. Reading made realize isnt norm everywhere lol. Glad state isnt run complete idiots lmfao. let‚Äôs make planes homes  I'm descalation. help front door employees, Walmart need real security guards. far Walmart enforcing front door signage rule! weeks they've signs up, wtf? Bunch snowflakes crybabies. want shop Walmart? Put effing mask.  Oh, surprised promotes masks considered helpful air-borne viruses. Obviously, way effectively work inside gym wearing expensive, name-brand workout clothes. work way. That's science. even lift? I'm sure Jeff Bezos like money. know richest man world whose company pay taxes... get they're trying discredit him? want boost support goes well, Donnie could swoop take credit? Or, goes poorly, could blame Fauci Donnie comes unscathed? really understand strategy. 

Edit: replies made audibly chuckle, going lie. It‚Äôs like nervous chuckle let know you‚Äôre deep shit can‚Äôt help let small little chuckle hint melancholic despair. 

I know Trump real end game, would think people around want succeed would say ‚ÄúHey Don.. actually give credit Fauci. It‚Äôs win-win you,‚Äù guess not. knew Washington filled bunch fucking idiots, this.. whole new level dumb.  customer refuses wear mask, let continue shop.

Real tough policy, that. Karen conspiracy theory boyfriend America: ‚ÄúHE SUPPORTS INFECTIOUS DISEASES SOCIETY AMERICA! RIGHT FRONT YOU! DR. FAUCI SUPPORTS SPREAD INFECTIOUS DISEASES! BILL GATESSSSSSSSS......!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! parent nuclear option created ton shit jobs

Published 15 July 2020 12:18 people making passionate speeches, that's populist logic ""let's make science cool!"" goes nowhere. need people power lead example, make decisions based informed arguments, need make accountable them. advance knowledge making cool, making norm.

Also, science, people usually forget humanities important society: ethics, philosophy, law, even journalism arts. belief science society built upon strong moral set humanities argues populism. Research please?

I link longer; COVID-19 article research doctor discussing effects obesity patients. I'm even sure study found even modest weight loss helps inflammation immune response.

I say weight loss help immune response. said reversed recent study looked obese people Type 2 diabetes prediabetes limited diet 1000 1600 calories day 24 weeks.

24 weeks half year. Lol buddy Reddit get facts here!

Rich people = bad
Free money = good
Starter jobs must pay enough support family number children comfortably.

I agree though it‚Äôs people don‚Äôt understand people say Bezos worth 150bil whatever it‚Äôs % ownership stake company worth much that. Basket case Trump. 

Thanks quote. context: 

[Remarks President Trump Tour Centers Disease Control Prevention | Atlanta, GA | White ‚ñ∂ [‚ÄòMaybe natural ability‚Äô: Trump plays medical expert coronavirus second-guessing professionals - Washington ‚ñ∂ [Trump‚Äôs Response Virus Reflects Long Disregard Science - New York (2020-04-28) time find new friends World* aligned next shortage masks desperately needed protect front-line medical staff, right advice. data belied advice, changed. Whoa. Scientific Method. Far out.

Problem CDC scientific institution also one engaged public relations. let's honest - public rather dumb short attention spans. CDC known [the primacy thing people gonna take first answer run it. 


Even know effective masks were, could told public ""the court's still out"", rather ""Nah, need them"". Gonna Frozen sequel Disney, featuring ‚Äúfreezer trucks‚Äù really expecting someone else mention [low T-cell response Moderna phase 1 **not** doctor, antibodies fall 50-90 days, T-cells proper response create antibodies also deliberately ordered key evidence erased investigation voter fraud, specifically asked to.

He literslly committed felony election fraud get charged it. rot goes way top. must look like idiots rest World?? wut anything stopping hospitals calling news reporters say many hospitalizations/death were? sorry wonderful loving brave person die army braindead morons refuses wear mask. RT myself, happening across company. enough PPE still. Wow, talk Orwellian rewriting history! Giesecke hired afterwards, hired specifically craft strategy. 

2 + 2 =/= 5 ilk 

Ah, inicivility personal attacks :) 


 look here's article Swedish strat supporters celebrating:

No mentioning ""beer"" ""drink"", lol $$$ rules all... Good thing coronavirus agreed take next 4 days off. trying get change mind giving nearly big shit uncovering nose still wearing mask?

Again. scared uncovered noses, probably bite bullet become hermit never leave house.

Should cut internet it, too. 31 year old sister asked could come across multiple states visit couple weeks.

I thought better then. That's exactly attitude made Trump hate him. Im completely nationalistic love country! ALSO SEE, totally backfire certain situations whole ""fuck government rules"" rebel mentality too! like...people can't separate virus outbreak anything else here. think another boogeyman ""control us"" take freedoms over. many MANY people listen rules follow advice. ""fuck dont tell do"" ""free country"". lot ways, still wild west, civil laws lol.

It's double edged sword MAY end downfall society...especially circumstances like viral outbreak Look type people make big portion voter base state versus states...not mention leaders support currently WH. colder temperatures everyone forced indoors. plus flu. look bad summer. fall winter gonna nightmare. Wow, shit insane. feel like I'm living sort convoluted Tom Clancy novel... really. efficacy data far, zero. also know protective correlate disease. Antibodies? B/T cells? Nothing? Everything? Hold horses, going get complicated. needed strong leadership case numbers low force sacrifice self ( likely cost political capital ) guess you‚Äôve gone far not.  case worlds case though lucky examples.  Wuhan military style lockdown months overloaded hospitals enough evidence warrant strong national response. 

The country ‚Äúshutdown‚Äù national lockdown unenforced except businesses half population riled claims hoax political gain. 

And top massive mask medical shortages killing hospital staff national leadership selling supplies highest bidders friends family supply lines. 

Absolute bullshit.  US good chance come ok.  Trump.  worlds worst leadership gave us worlds worst outcome. agree suck. Interesting. title article came is:
White House says Trump followed CDC guidance Atlanta mayor accuses breaking mask law funny. problem operate entirely emotion. favorite emotion fear. seen hate everything, including themselves. People don‚Äôt either trust data don‚Äôt understand science? don‚Äôt know, don‚Äôt think way. instance, heard people say hospitals counting deaths from
Covid without positive test. instance arrive ER fever, trouble breathing, can‚Äôt taste smell die getting positive test. Given situation say cause death Covid...and people use way say numbers inflated.

I mean, it‚Äôs pretty clear catching cases months ago due increased testing. However, think well explained. doomsday scenarios hyped early hospital ships sent NYC....and doesn‚Äôt really come that, see people start get confused. leadership entire political party years told people news lie, don‚Äôt trust ‚Äúcoastal elites,‚Äù side trying destroy country....this get Well, tbf pony links complaining annoying asked something obvious. ;) also Trump's Tulsa rally without mask. probably got there, Walmart. mean, sub full wumaos downvote anyone criticizes CCP hordes spread pro-CCP propaganda ...I'm sure everybody virus free time funeral... reported. scope. fully reopen like US states plan do? Everything bigger Texas. results took 15 days. seems cutting number labs running tests going cause others backlogged. labs saying lack materials process tests.  


My question reliable results? properly storing samples? False negative already huge problem. years ago overweight lost 20 lbs, putting middle normal BMI bracket. coworkers thought dying ""so skinny""....A European friend worked like looks like regular person Europe now, lol. kind true, I've England many fatties US, mega fatties. Trump really showing world fucking scumbag is. possible fail hard, country is, seems like he's making point pure stubborness. Vote November guys, ffs. stories circulating since early China days...they really need get general public know bc finally get dumb politicians take seriously like asking links water makes things wet 

You yesterday asking sources size Swedish counties lol, one Google click away don‚Äôt see information would change strategy dealing virus way. would ‚Äúwell sucks‚Äù. Kool-aid. Flavor-aid. vaccine would likely fail There's difference ""this affects demographic disproportionately"" ""this affects x demographic""... AIDS/HIV initially perceived : GRID Gay-Related Immune Deficiency. I‚Äôve heard like December already US. I‚Äôd find really hard believe wouldn‚Äôt already city then. horse dead Trump prison. ‚ÄúI want speak GoFundMe‚Äôs manager!‚Äù get caught make Trump look bad. formally employed consultant FHM specifically help craft Swedens' coronavirus strategy.

So someone hired Swedens Coronavirus strategy implemented hired help craft Swedish coronavirus strategy. Check.

Again. impressed ability let facts get way narrative. governors invalidating local municipalities enacting mask mandates? wonder shenanigans try pull private businesses like Kroger Walmart moving forward mandates customers. Everyone makes mistakes. Making mistakes part human. There's shame it. Admitting mistakes, apologizing warranted correcting mistakes key. Something side debate could learn from. wife, agrees me. MPH MBA. So...... now? i'm citing actual expert people tallking asses, really reddit expert wonder. I'm glad asked. tell think impressive story think might feel know it. mind-blowing. 

So plague years people began wearing masks many parts Italy especially port cities like Venice believed stuffing herbs nose masks one could ward plague. 

Masks, became common items daily life soon fashion item well women's masks men's masks taking different characters. 

So here's starts get weird. seems men came notion wear woman's mask become woman mean engaged homosexual activities wearing masks considered crime men masked women hence homosexual act. 

Now, read quite surprised logic thought quite stretch imagination apparently pope time think strange agreed long man wore woman's mask sexual act two men homosexual since man woman face were.

Well already amazing story gets better. bare titties? came next. female prostitutes Venice soon noticed losing clients guys getting legit gay sex scene pope decreed okay eyes church. prostitutes went pope demanding justice. 

The pope seeing problem decided fair thing would allow prostitutes heat business allowing show tits public long stood balcony. became legal prostitutes walk around breasts exposed order counter loss business rise masked homosexuality. 

How story? also British slang ""Italian disease"" euphemism homosexuality arises. makes watching Merchant Venice much interesting know they're wearing masks represented even bare breasted women. farts; shits probably. Let's hope virus puts end poisonous ""all bodies beautiful"" narrative.

There's reason we're innately repulsed people skinny/too fat. unhealthy. either, help it. Learn viruses spread.  ""I can't breath"" ""you can't hear me."" latter favorite. I'll let know can't hear you. try explain clearly without insult.

The 600 dollars indeed temporary. entire creation built upon theory job losses would also temporary. 

The job losses temporary. money turning off. eviction moratorium also expire. such, many Americans looking evicted August September midst pandemic spreading uncontrollably across country lifeline hope finding job. believe u/AnotherTooth referring post. Kids get sniffles. even count cases. since everyone surface planet party anti-trump covid conspiracy, report covid every time get booboo.

/s Well know # LOL Yes are, ""people"" voices head. thought hoax worse flu... would listened worn mask, simple thing, would avoided this,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúI work bank ‚Äì I‚Äôm always around people ‚Äì like I‚Äôm fine, I‚Äôm fine. Never think I‚Äôd catch Hetal Rana, physician Medical City North Hills, says they‚Äôre seeing young patients contract virus. COVID unit hospital basically full past six weeks, staff seen much negativity,‚Äù Dr. Rana said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen lot patients die hospital situation.‚Äù could hear Always Sunny music playing.  TIL awhile ago (a month so), commented it‚Äôs surprising people would resist wearing seatbelt uncomfortable, regardless science behind pointed anti maskers.

I got DOZENS comments saying different is, seat belt isn‚Äôt even uncomfortable don‚Äôt know asthma triggered masks on. It‚Äôs tiring. commenters elsewhere thread mocked idiots resisted seatbelts. That's money time spent vaccines ewe **NEED** vaccine for. point creating vaccine mild, rapidly mutating virus one extremely rare. many places, employees can't rude customers. lose jobs. many places, ridiculous old adage ""the customer always right!"" still rules. many ""customers"" take advantage that. work home thankfully (after 3 covid scares office) desk window get sun. neighbors don‚Äôt like practice social distancing outside wear masks work doors lol. try get every week half groceries can‚Äôt get delivered still see sun sometimes lol It‚Äôs still spreading slowly NY NJ Well must comfortable. must lucky. Millions country position. Millions terrified losing homes they've lost job health insurance. volatile situation.

Desperate people desperate things. already pull weight preventing spread, don‚Äôt need restricted further, especially conditions impossible force. wouldn‚Äôt fix anything. wait vaccine point. That's subtraction totals according state report says 116,311 instead 79,831which 36,480 subtraction totals says is. every negative test person counts new test since state tries lower positivity rate people think bad. According state today's 12.94% positivity rate. around 4.5% difference state data calculations data. There's article talks ""Florida‚Äôs hidden data skews COVID-19 test results"" here's link  Destroying tourism permanently? Sounds little melodramatic.  think Spain, many EU countries, fully prepared shut September.

This pragmatic attempt balancing economic needs controlling virus. Open tourism July August deal impending second wave. There's many conflicting comments lmao

We need MD like Chubbyemu come explain stuff everyone using medically correct factual peer-reviewed information.  Daniel Cameron think, confused David Cameron conservative former UK PM safety nets people positions. mention, bars restaurants notoriously high failure rates good times. 

You‚Äôre good this, you? Yeah looks like south California killing us. hoax it?  something talk get Hope feel UK :,-( It‚Äôs possible populations biologically susceptible COVID-19 others.

It's useless. gonna it? ""Wear mask ethnicity?""     
It's pandemic, global, period.    
When pandemic started, said old people affected people translated ""I'm old, kid old, can't infected.""   
       
Statistics much fallacious. may little useful doctors, hardly. far yet see single good thing happened kind ethnic data. three months ago back April. frustrating thing: spoke friend Illinois said nurses saying totally exaggerated democratic hoax make Trump look bad.   register rest world taking seriously, sir... Democratic subversion. know someone lost relative COVID.

His theory? believes ""lib"" hospital staffs deliberately murdered relative pump death number up.

You want know comes conclusion It‚Äôs criminal. ...people need public areas sometimes. Better ventilator possible permanent organ damage, no? 22nd? Today! Follow money Well Wallyworld needs people spend money. die can't spend. government care less. *are* processing tests. Nationally [a steady climb 200,000 day 700,000 last three months.

It's virus spreads exponentially even that's enough... Folks repeated negative PCR tests, dropping dead couple months later. no, don‚Äôt believe deaths factored assertions unaware virus keeps killing initial infection. mainly stores many different names. example, Phoenix, Fry's ubiquitous chain (which Kroger brand). way probably would've heard name ""Kroger"" store-branded products named such. want point rate that, rate. necessarily connected testing enough. testing lot low positive rate. 


Secondly, contact tracing still super hard 5%, due lag time tests (leads contacts per case people dumb-asses self quarantine getting tested results) number contacts person has.


5% still pretty high incidence population lead explosions behaviors lapse.

 Let's say 100K tests 5000 positive. person positive 4 contacts. That's 20,000 people daily need contacted via phone. many reachable day, call tomorrow next day too. follow ups too. But, oops - another batch 20K contacts rolls days too

So contact tracers quickly get overwhelmed. Even 15 cases per day per contact tracer 8 hr workday CONCLUSIONS: Overall, findings suggest SARS-CoV-2 well transmitted via airborne route controlled conditions. speculate SARS-CoV-2 may opportunistically airborne, transmission occurring via droplet methods.

WHO saying exactly context COVID-19, airborne transmission may possible specific circumstances settings procedures support treatments generate aerosols performed; i.e., endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, administration nebulized treatment, manual ventilation intubation, turning patient prone position, disconnecting patient ventilator, non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation, tracheostomy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

Because flu vaccines made way. need pick strains include always several months flu season.

No, not. part responsible information flowing White House POTUS.

So Robert Redfield, MD, director Centers Disease Control Prevention, called universal mask use. see sub giving Trump credit calling universal mask use.

Funny time federal official says something think spin negatively, 100% Trump's fault, time federal official says something agree with, suddenly Trump nothing it.

Luckily people GA, executive order impacts public property; stores/private property right decide masks mandatory since government would shit day trying tell judge allowed stomp someones land tell lol. example Athens, local Trader Joes store mandating masks worn times, 25 people max store, let employees stay home months feel risk high without losing benefits (contrary business/laws area). all. correct terminology.  can't kill virus never alive. problem! really don‚Äôt get men, especially get 5‚Äô10‚Äù. It‚Äôs bad women. feel like don‚Äôt clue average male build like. It‚Äôs like assume average build men distance runner slim hollow bones.

Florida pandemic episode med procedural going better ratings New York based one. # asskissers. Well given direction curve, likely 156 died yesterday. deaths week ago, means victims infected early June. 

In month deaths far higher. suspect groups file pay income tax others pay payroll tax.
But doesn‚Äôt make juicy race-war headline. covid? virus gone

Mostly gone suppressed?

By moderators ""picking out"" valid US news source claiming ""low quality"" information.

I posted news article. see contains important information coronavirus applied could save lives. think making wrong assumption .

I'd assume many couples may sex ( we're stuck together more) number risky sexual situations generally gone .

If wanna catch rona probably good time swipe Tinder explore many many ways one night stand fling type. imagine fewer condoms purchased fewer risky sexual activities strangers explored "" generally"". empathy running out. empathy poor kind soul gave life fighting plague without support government. 

I empathy willfully ignorant idiots endanger others lives over-inflated sense self worth. I'm gonna celebrate death laugh killing sheer fucking stupidity. I'm going sorry deaths either. state-sanctioned mass murder - country this, world opinion (probably led USA), would calling regime change due human rights abuses. many actually symptoms ?? wake coma? virus spreading possibly six months. looks like Vodka, smells like Vodka tastes like Vodka, probably Vodka. course. Given current situation (happily) alone bad, change time right BEES!!!! could try stop reporting information backlash would insane. There's real way could possibly spin good thing. 

Also media could go straight testing facilities get data (which believe lady went rogue created dashboard did). White House concern virus *spin* it, fight it. Fauci CDC appropriate spinning ‚îÄ out. seems White House relying constituency advocates ""herd immunity"" strategy wearing masks.     

Fighting virus top priority Nov 3rd. Thank you, am. work MI affordable housing office (public sector), I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd able get not. people GOP shitting anti pandemic policies. don‚Äôt ask work together. Canadian - even say sorry find vaccine them. article eye-rollingly nauseating point lost. someone starts throwing idiot terms around like ""wage-slavery"" ""drenched privilege"" point trying make drowned sound rhetoric.

However, issue valid even author can't articulate well. good options educating kids fall many families. Many families position, due decisions circumstances beyond control. sucks. There's way public dole support every parent decides quit jobs stay home educate kids (nor it). Many parents capable teaching kids home either. also know schools going petri dish amount lip service keep masked, socially distanced ultimately COVID-free. problem good solution leaders failed protect us...and we've done shit job protecting ourselves.

As single-income family, made many sacrifices years ""not having"" many things could family member home raise kids. works year wife responsibility - also time - educate youngest home. (fuck privilege, earned shit) sacrifice works favor year. feel badly couldn't/can't much sympathy (like neighbors) dual incomes solely live lavish lifestyles complaining issue. 22nd populous country world, mention second worst affected Covid Europe. Eventually someone gonna decide gun isn‚Äôt going deterrent waylaid guy right hook. True might get shot two hit one steps likely others follow pound guy paste ‚ÄúPretty sure probably‚Äù

89% sure case Italy may universal died something else, happened suffer Covid, too.

Very popular argument among brain dead Germany.

Thank fuck least government bright enough MAKE everyone wear masks, we‚Äôd dire shape, too. lawyer. never travelled. first case confirmed community spread snd idea got it. tested family, it, tested recent acquaintances, it, kept finding related cases. schools, business associates, religious community. bad. one confirmed case led like 200 positives. first ill hospitalized. 2021- cornavirus cured joe Biden office. perfect hell lot better current situation. Uh, direct deposit required far away fastest simplest way move money. black filed using direct deposit, got Trump bucks right away. Even ""official"" threshold must cross scientist‚Äîand clear, isn't‚ÄîBill Nye unquestionably education, background experiences anyway.

If want attack message, confuse issue going messenger. Say really wanted say. well starters, today != 3 weeks ago unable get tested. Who's watching would care company ""hoarding"" PPE? curious. Yeah, that's fair That's them, then. think people understand deaths reported discovered, July 15th 156 people died, could happen Plague, Inc. clearly putting people harm's way. said, individuals common sense, wearing masks along social distancing, okay. Governor ends decimating base large group republicans... deaths hands. Unfortunately, hard humans right thing own. Stay safe!!!!! deaths cases go unison NYC? hospitals overrun certainly cases testing allowed. 

It‚Äôs surprising Florida assume there‚Äôs undiscovered cases they‚Äôre weeks NYC numbers deaths. It‚Äôs it‚Äôs taking deaths Florida. There‚Äôs exponential uptick. It‚Äôs it‚Äôs lower NYC. local Target Colorado requiring masks since mid-May. Even little late.

Why happened sooner..... üòÇ going keep trading states federal government comes senses (read: get rid Trump GOP death cult) institutes nationwide lockdown. first ain't gonna last either. Cause usa gotten covid control working getting control means hospitals get whelmed patients leads denying care, also leads hospital staff exhausting selfs lead massive ammount nurses doctors working even long month leaving hospitals short staff, also make hospital staff vulnerable infected, add ontop nurses doctors die peoples morale goes thing right thing keeping doctors nurses hopes hope keep fighting. also hope ever chipmunk brained idiot choosing aid forcing people follow safety quidelines going die decease letting spread kill people ""Guests"" bother. Talking people dont money, money works, complete waste energy. good positivity rate one lower day week before. Israel positivity rate probably 0.1 % May, look - massive lockdown again. trend matters. don‚Äôt develop lasting immunity viral diseases

We though. MMR gives long immunity, oral polio vaccine thought give life-long (or least long) immunity three doses. bad been? naughty? get vaccine people wear masks practice social distancing, could covid-19 go forever? really feel parents kids virtual learning doesn‚Äôt really work whatever reason. yet, even year missed school beats dead ending lifelong lung/heart issues book. going whatever given circumstances. Read Morgan Freeman voice. hes using fart noises late 90s too....lame *Horrified 21 BMI* Hahaha Trump thought would help re-election chances he‚Äôd it. That‚Äôs cares about.   agree would change strategy working full speed vaccine already? Nobody sane advocating mass infections pursuit socially engineered herd immunity zero comprehension skills. 

ZERO states want report - think Stitt would choose report high case numbers? Yes, actually is, assuming muscular athlete broad build. average build 6' male, 40 pounds going solid beer gut spare tire. Came say - ""you all"" deliberate attempt never getting employed anywhere. # Society? believe months research, current data suggests likely contract via droplets air. According research, seems less likely, though impossible, become infected touching surfaces. 

Washing hands won‚Äôt keep inhaling (or exhaling) infectious droplets air.

Washing hands obviously good hygiene, beneficial you‚Äôve recently touched lot public surfaces close proximity infected person. 

[CDC - virus 

[WHO - Transmission 

[New York Times - What‚Äôs risk catching coronavirus 

I scientist medical worker. Anyone knowledgeable current research please correct point direction information. see logic

That's bug, that's feature.  Yes, absolutely mean trump. proud andy proud say voted him. buffoon president that's problem. Well, along attorney general trying everything stop everything andy done us. Andy made another announcement today trying do. attorney general see great state compared others? Andy actions. entire family cheered joy voted bevin out! imagine still him? think teachers get paid work summer, except week two school starts 'planning'. mean exactly ‚Äúyou all‚Äù? 

You keep trying deny racial inequalities ""tired race war notion skin color anything got stimulus check absoluteLY BIZARRE.

Well, true, deal rather trying ignore it. major issues getting stimulus lower income people article describes there's major racial inequality country issue people like taking one topic responding broadly.

You're one went broad talking ""race war BS"". Breaking news: COVID-19 kills people might exception that. problem two opposing sides White House right now.

One side (led Birx Fauci) thinks fight virus following proven epidemiological methods mask wearing, social distancing, lock downs, sanitation, testing, contact tracing. side (probably led Trump Navarro) thinks fight virus opening economy seeing happens.

They opposite sides impossible find common ground. Right, well Canadian I've never really paid much attention ramblings much glaring headlines. interested enough would skim article two vid scratching head.

How guy know much? humanly possible know much without head exploding? knows everything... funny, wonder many non maskers wearing altitude training masks working outm Sheer ignorance categorically false. Multiple studies done demonstrating efficacy masks, even simple surgical cloth masks, preventing spread viruses. showed masks effective protecting others wearer, increased protection wearer well. research clear YEARS: suppressed? posted it. Smh. love ""3rd wave"" 67 daily cases.... 

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile US first wave, lowest daily case numbers ever saw 16,663 one day. live California, I'm really disheartened recent increase cases, shut back again. I'm grateful governor, hope people follow damn mandate wear masks. I'm essential worker, go every weekday work. biggest change life seeing friends family past months. lonely hell, ngl. internet help, though. Mask usage needs clearly stated school‚Äôs policy guidelines stating kids suspended expelled failure wear masks. asshole parents complain comply guidelines.

There zero tolerance policies drugs weapons school. needs applied failure wear face covering. Well beg question, USA 50 countries 50 segments country. it‚Äôs 50 countries you‚Äôre right UK USA comparable, otherwise compare England alone US flip flopping update view based data? Wouldn‚Äôt opposite ignoring science?  also sure impact asymptotic carriers mid late March guidelines changed. Funny, get called troll sub too. I?

I'm surprised - consistently criticize traditional media, criminal president, point pro-lockdowners anti-lockdowners find common ground attack corporatists seek foment division transfer wealth back up. Oh, constantly argue anyone listening impoverished class protections government failed them.

Yet I'm troll. Obesity pretty much guarantees chronic inflammation, great considering acute inflammatory damage endothelial cells thought resulting severe cases. hate see it. would say 850 300m good sample size, even least reasons thinking study biased misleading. without seeing actual questionnaire percentage sample size belonged group, lots room bias manipulation areas. I'm sorry lost job, everything sucks right now. hope things get better you.

In week leading shutdown MA, 2 coworkers returned work saying getting ""very nasty flu."" Covid anxiety already high among staff, people coughing sneezing everywhere go home despite pleading coworkers. They're generally good people otherwise, country really need reevaluate social etiquette we're sick. Yeah, although assumes we're getting real data them. Florida trying suppress numbers much possible. cases 10x recorded amount someone tell far along herd immunity anyways ? That's sad statement American intellect want celebrities instead scientists tell people wear masks.

Where been? That's nothing new. Anti-Intellectualism essentially American trait. Ah yes, millions Americans bring unemployed completely unable afford rent food better option. I'm troll, new cases Arizona seem trending downwards, it? Hospitalizations deaths eventually reflect downward trend surely? Yeah friend tested Texas hear bad day. friends heard back 1-2 days. difference would make manufactured lab? I'm argue that. still fact infectious disease. Like many people said, believe created enemy government, protecting fellow citizens best way help said enemy government. virus serving much karma Fauci president! help election year. Everything gets fucked election year power country grabs. Politics.scitiloP ""we can't know yet"" narrative silly propaganda pushed Swedish authorities. 

We certainly *can* know: Test, Trace, Isolate (TTI) demonstrated work places like New Zealand, Taiwan (who approaching 100 days without local infection), South Korea, Icealnd, Norway, Finland, Denmark, etc. 

It's ""propaganda"" discuss Sweden's failings based numbers: higher per capita death toll currently overall Nordic neighbors pursued supression / TTI economy bad worse neighbors. facts. 

They're also country region worried bad second wave. one else due proven capability TTI contain cluster outbreaks. really becoming apparent big portion media genuinely disgusting. None us need intentionally inflammatory half-truths right now. headline designed stoke racial resentment.

Sometimes truly feels like they're trying turn people other. How‚Äôs spring break treating dumbass mofos? forget Eurovision agree. unless business makes mandatory... own. correct starting 12 sams.. I'll leave previous comment concede incorrect. Many us not. rest dead using bible fend virus. People look fat people people eating cheeseburgers fast food stuff! important people try healthy shaming strangers weight loss isn‚Äôt gonna help may even opposite affect. Obese people know do, try supportive people matter what. aren‚Äôt less valuable size. Oh haven‚Äôt carded years. Aren‚Äôt sweet thinks he's expert. knows damn well damage doing. real experts wanting spend public funds public, miss lot graft. dollars. put destroyers every department reason. gonna work two weeks lol? ""Zoom""? appears we're back part knowing read charts think y-axis going 0 bit max value somehow weird. ever seen chart before?

We're dealing one claim: said deaths ""plateaued"", see, trending solidly upward. means wrong. questions? 

Are midwest per chance? anything experts matter? Home Depot required months. God there‚Äôs like 50 articles every day. means jack shit. Cell immunity persists otherwise we‚Äôd seeing millions reinfections 7 months shit show.

The good news Oxford‚Äôs vaccine shown develop antibodies cell immunity. grim, might well bought child-sized coffins. Awww thank you! &lt;3 Yeah realized worked threw mouth. craziest part think could closed deal election almost nothing. walk press conferences, say platitudes victims we're everything can, here's doctor Fauci latest. give standing order Fauci gets wants shut let Fauci job. 

That's it, 5 minutes day back watching fox thing would probably much better, election chances would much better (although they're still way higher be). said , . Get well soon. like use important looking symbols assume authorization ‚ÄúMedical Care‚Äù. Even Nigerian email scams put effort this. Fuck sorry. think factors involved well like age blood type too. Americans massively stupid time massively confident, that's it. Dunning Kruger 2020 listen experts first told us worry masks virus hardly threat U.S. Meanwhile, countries already taking steps early on. boss wife 60's-70's contact positive case weekend, decided come work short period time yesterday... never wore masks work thought whole thing blown proportion,Ha. One friends girlfriends tested positive he's also worried. best week, hope y'all staying safe gonna make through! That's NY state requires it.....

It also depends who's insulting you. Adults care toddler calls poopyhead, would make sense adults care Trump calls stupid. mean, guess could terrible summer fall, winter could okay everybody going catch die caught died. wants ""educate"" people real. 

He deleted account. blame wanting hear avalanche Told So. like continues use account advocate cause something. He's hiding. ethical issues, there's huge number scientific issues.

How exposing volunteers? dose virus receiving? receiving dose? compare would receive normal environment?

A lot questions easily answered...with even human challenge experiments. Without baseline they'd need extremely effective vaccine get clear result.

It's terrible idea. YEAH GUY WENT SKYDIVING WITHOUT PARACHUTE SHOT HEAD STRAY BULLET WAY LANDED ACTIVE VOLCANO? ""Child sized"" coffin probably worse.  dont say.... lol anyone still believe bastard?

""American"" you. like reddit stop using plain simple. introverted kid rich parents afford 1 parent work force fine.

Extroverted kids poor parents suffer most.  good summary information article (not academic report, news article). Though one major point think news missing antibody drop offs natural infection necessarily relationship vaccine development. Vaccines made generate large immune responses portions virus (or sometimes whole inactivated virus) rely additional adjuvants (chemicals activate immune response) induce immune system act. natural infection relying virus stimulate immune system may lead induction different type response (potentially less immunogenic polarizing response differently etc). possible vaccine induced antibodies completely different long term behavior antibodies produced natural infection. Oh look that, reality paying visit

Or karma agree he‚Äôs saying shouldn‚Äôt mandate. valid concern. Rule good enforced. places city/local govt haven‚Äôt mandated, think enforcing ?

The Ministry Social Affairs Health also advocated following: notification system various actors offer tracking assistance municipalities healthcare districts, well mapping municipalities' tracking capacity plans. 

In addition, authorities constantly monitor chains infection quarantine decisions implemented. 

An app tells long close carrier development.

- tracking app completed, offers additional help investigations infection chains. regardless app, expert tracking work needed areas, says Pasi Pohjola Ministry Social Affairs Health.

**It important test track, otherwise epidemic spread.**

- good preparedness terms management materials. succeed tracking chains, everything else help, says emergency manager Pekka Tulokas.

#Info patient runs smoothly within HYY
Helsinki Uusimaa's healthcare district HYY built program makes possible municipalities within district follow tracking patient. 

- Getting information run different actors taken lot time, therefore important actors connect new system, says Asko J√§rvinen, chief physician infectious diseases HYY. 

The app ready yet. Technical problems solved summer, J√§rvinen adds.

#3. Isolate:

**Schools ready close doors needed**

The government ready move distance education schools autumn local education cannot carried safe way. 

A constitutional amendment (521/2020) makes possible arrange distance education without contingency law. laws come force first August force end year.

#4. Care: Intensive care better prepared Finland queuing covid-19 vaccine

Nursing staff trained intensive care, health care districts prepared new covid-19 patients. 

The Helsinki Uusimaa Health Care District HYY maintains wards covid-19 patients cared least spring winter 2021. 

More nursing staff still trained corona intensive care units. way, care secured covid-19 patients epidemic gets worse. 

- unnecessary train staff, knowledge useful possible epidemics, says chief physician deputy chief physician Piia Aarnisalo.

It also important enough people know corona intensive care unit, staff annual vacation.

#Everyone waiting vaccine

Finland signed international collaborations order vaccines, within EU internationally.

- binding, means signed involved get vaccine together, says Jari Kein√§nen, head department safety health Ministry Social Affairs Health.

There many want vaccine, fight likely fierce. countries chosen develop vaccines own, Finland cooperation countries.

We get vaccine earliest next year, says Kein√§nen.

#Last least: Continue protect others

The fact everyone washes hands often still effective protection spread coronavirus .

In addition, healthcare professionals must protect patients protective equipment face protection protective coats.

According Ministry Social Affairs Health, 22,000 - 56,000 respiratory protection manufactured Finland FFP2 FFP3 levels. Protective clothing produced 55,000 - 180,000 pieces per day. may needed.

- enough infection spreads spring, says special expert Ministry Social Affairs Health Lasse Ilkka Finnish Yle.

- example, took close one million surgical face protections per day spring, says Ilkka. 

The aim increase production domestic protective equipment. emergency preparedness center, health care districts, municipalities private service providers happy order domestically.

It matter obtaining CE certificate domestic products, ie stamp sufficiently good quality. Exceptionally, protection able manufactured without certificate, autumn, CE marking needed, among things, ensure products stored.

The equipment stored Finland stock take epidemic breaks disturbances international market.

- good collaboration contract suppliers also opened new procurement chains. example, successful negotiations Finnish manufacturers start increase domestic production protective equipment, says Mika P√§iv√§rinta, technical manager HYY.

Finland constantly evaluating much protective equipment, medicines, medical equipment monitors needed.

It balancing act access storing smart way. filling warehouse things needed also become obsolete becomes expensive.

- machine battery lasts, example, six years, needed, sell three years global market send development work, says Pekka Tulokas Ministry Social Affairs Health. 

To respond this, Nordic warehouses also developed co - operation countries. 

#The queues [health care] covid-19 return normal

The corona spring brought many canceled doctor appointments non-urgent care. 

- important seek care need it, stick agreed visits, says Piia Aarnisalo, chief physician HYY.

At HYY, number patients call returning normal. itself, summer always calmer period.

THL encourages patients seek care, states safe visit health center business reorganized clients protected coronavirus infection.

The state's joint telephone counseling service coronavirus works weekdays 8‚Äì21 Saturdays 9-15. suspect corona symptoms, must fill assessment web via service omaolo.fi. Thanks. helpful know absolutely go in-person appointments. course hand, lots factors consider still make uneasy. Stay safe! teased ginger hair, know people teased skinny. Kids assholes. abnormality normalisations society, kids trying fit in, kids wanna fit assholes. Added sources / background you.

I agree contrast seen countries. Mainly ones East Asia greater experience deadly outbreaks past 20 years, often valued lift community individual. 

The US course emphasizes individual ( neither inherently wrong, better, though sometimes people take prioritization one destructive end).

Germany, Sweden, Brazil, Mexico, Russia extent, list goes growing. countries similar leader similar shade response. groups struggling things. cases good shepherd might steer back, others lack understanding desire act don‚Äôt control many things. Crimea Russia. reap sowed, Anglos. made LoL

but yes panicking, planning children 2 years. 


Thank reading Qwuothe We‚Äôre staying state youngest graduates high school. kids CCP, college credit plus, they‚Äôre getting college paid for. oldest wants move Canada. seriously though, enterprising dictator wanted destabilize U.S., would 100% aim fuck test data get U.S. mass distribute faulty vaccine.  #Translation:

More medicines, protective equipment, virus tests vaccines. Right now, corona situation calm Finland. work ensure safety event second wave full swing.

The number confirmed corona cases Finland ten cases per day. R-number 1, government continued ease restrictions.

In Finland, estimated 6,700 people recovered covid-19. 9 10 diagnosed cases infection. [The epidemic situation relatively calm present]( around world, pandemic continues ravage. According experts interviewed article, second epidemic wave possible Finland. least smaller clusters covid-19 disease flare up.
- still middle global pandemic. New cases cluster infection also occur countries epidemic control. European countries, things going down, says Pasi Pohjola Ministry Social Affairs Health.

Finland well prepared new cases covid-19. testing capacity infection tracing significantly extensive February-March, says Pasi Pohjola, head Ministry Social Affairs Health.

- healthcare districts municipalities also better prepared thanks experiences spring changed routines operations.

- global perspective, also know much virus behaves now, says Pohjola.

According Asko J√§rvinen, chief physician infectious diseases HYY, well prepared cases covid-19 bed wards kept prepared. 


#Finland adheres to: ""Test, track, isolate nurture""

The healthcare districts, Institute Health Welfare, Ministry Social Affairs Health - goal: able handle new corona epidemic government's hybrid strategy.

It means following restrictions society, investing ""testing, tracking, isolating caring"".

The purpose hybrid strategy prevent virus spreading society, ensure capacity health care overloaded particularly protect people belong risk groups.
Pasi Pohjola points important restrictions relaxed carefully impact evaluated relation infection situation Finland.

Below, Swedish Yle goes strategy means practice Finland learned far crisis.

Finland capacity 13,000 corona tests day. picture drive-in coronatest Porvoo. 
 
#1. Test: better testing

The goal continue test anyone suspected acute coronavirus infection. help testing, sources infection chains infection traced and, best case, lead spread infection limited.

At present, 13,000 covid-19 tests taken every day. exceeds Ministry Social Affairs Health's target daily test capacity 10,000 samples. also substantial increase compared spring testing capacity 1,700 samples.

At present, however, Finland nowhere near maximum capacity. 3,000 4,000 tests done daily throughout country, according THL.

The tests also become better reliable. spring, test results incorrect due testing early late course disease. test repeated necessary symptoms match covid-19, says Carita Savolainen-Kopra, expert Institute Health Welfare's Department Microbiology Yle Uutiset .

The tests become better reliable- Expert Institute Health Welfare

But CPR [ed. note: think &amp; following instance typo meant PCR] tests, widely used Finland, fastest. test results run laboratory day, take day person tested gets result.

The Ministry Social Affairs Health's emergency manager Pekka Tulokas says CPR test slow corona tests wait test result 24 hours. 

Quick tests would needed able easily test, example, travelers airports ports.

- quick test needed travelers come Europe, says emergency manager Pekka Tulokas Ministry Social Affairs Health.

On hand, rapid tests still reliable. Ministry Social Affairs Health following situation, yet investing rapid test.

#2. Tracking: Finland builds army trackers 

The first Finn died covid-19 March 20. time, 70 new cases illness diagnosed per day Finland.

At time, Helsinki, disease prevalent, dozen trackers tracked infected people. enough people quickly find exposed virus.

Now situation different. **An army trackers built. corona epidemic picks speed again, hundreds trained trackers able pull in.**

At universities Helsinki, Tampere Eastern Finland, new corona trackers trained online course professional healthcare professionals. 2,000 people signed courses, midsummer 500 compared course.

- epidemic situation calm, good time education, says Pekka Nuorti, responsible education University Tampere.

The so-called tracking army one part tracking readiness. 

1/2 lot people cars need travel across country. need go back school job car unfortunately, way. changes regarding pandemic occurred rapidly it‚Äôs proof one, including Fauci, knows they‚Äôre doing. told, beginning, we‚Äôd many 2 million deaths. told we‚Äôd 200,000 deaths end May. revised August. it‚Äôs November. guess misjudged rapidly pages calendar turn. 

Now you‚Äôll probably say that‚Äôs data available. really means rushed judgment want consequential. also hear Fauci White House constantly odds. that‚Äôs case, doesn‚Äôt resign? You‚Äôll probably say it‚Äôs he‚Äôs noble, it‚Äôs really loves attention. That‚Äôs painfully obvious.

Something like really meant happen. politicians charge supposed communicate nonpartisan ideas general public Fauci. We're lucky enough Fauci good job it, job. we're backwards USA right now, we've forced behind-the-scenes people like Fauci shoulder lot national communication, probably would happened administration worth anything.

The problem people partying streets, every city tries stop people gathering usual party spots sky. Usually Police arrives tells people keep 5 feet distance. nice, progress anyway! Seems like lots Sweden‚Äôs major museums reopening protocols place keep visitors safe. None seem quite extensive as, example, [the Louvre‚Äôs]( measures hey better nothing. it‚Äôs [month two-ish behind Danish museums]( guess herd immunity hasn‚Äôt delayed reopening much area others like amusement parks (Swedish ones remain closed season Danish ones open since early June). 

The museum really damn cool, one interesting Nordic region imo. main attraction Vasa: huge ship sank 1,300 setting forth maiden voyage 1628. remained recovered 1961. It‚Äôs incredibly impressive would amazing low attendance coronavirus regulations require.

Sidenote: told Danish bff article said ‚Äúyou know, Vasa good analogy Sweden‚Äôs coronavirus strategy: sank right away take forever recover it‚Äù. Danish black humor best. fair, slow going think Swedes recover sunken ship COVID response far 333 years passed. Hopefully they'll even done salvaging end summer! think fair chance tbh.

Science, prevention science particular, process constantly refining recommendations based new data. Previous studies pointed masks possible pain point respiratory epidemic due improper usage. aligned next shortage masks desperately needed protect front-line medical staff, right advice. data belied advice, changed. Whoa. Scientific Method. Far out. 

People like running around saying CDC told people wear masks malicious intent undermines current advice provided much giving (what know) incorrect advice. contributing anti-science bias problem well. They're pushing hard liability immunity realize they're fucked much liability they've already exposed to. think reasonable focus capable leaving. oh bad, impression young elderly risk adults Maybe anti-maskers, ‚Äòmore people die flu‚Äô people, ‚Äòeveryone get let live life‚Äô people (or variation garbage) literally able breed anymore.

Oh no, anything that. fear public transport employees Europe introduced obligation, justified, assholes, ones enforce it, police for. wish exist, bought show exist. medical group exist supports Trump Fauci.  UChicago paper estimated 2/3 people collecting federal $600 making prior pandemic. I‚Äôm college age, anecdotally several friends making money lives.

The Vasa Museum Stockholm reopening closed several months due corona pandemic.


Missing visitors museum led long-term financial problems Jenny Lind, deputy director Vasa Museum, believes affect operations well future.


- certainly affect us several years future. something look make calculations adapt business. also take small steps back. open see next step be. simply limit supply according financial situation, says Jenny Lind.


Like many museums, Vasa Museum Stockholm recently closed due spread covid-19. Jenny Lind says needed time ""corona-adapt"" museum, ready visitors again.


- adapted business. 16 weeks really secure business visitors staff. take fewer visitors house, guided tours example refer audio guide restrictions cinema well, says Jenny Lind.


But time museum closed major impact business. state-owned museum, Vasa Museum hardly savings lack revenue led dismissal enormous competence according Jenny Lind.


- visitors closed 16 weeks affected us hard. also affected staff, course, transition process lay people, sad. wish happen, says Jenny Lind.


The Vasa Museum able stay open least rest year according Jenny Lind hopes fair flow visitors.


- Yes, hope like today, reasonable current really spread house. also hope local audience, Stockholmers rest Sweden come Stockholm, really come Vasa Museum discover much see, says Jenny Lind. need come senses actual scientific studies show people overweight obese underestimate much weigh. countries majority overweight obese, people healthy bmi stigmatized unhealthy, underweight told go eat hamburger.

For record, I‚Äôm referring election future elections too. Republican governors going go hiding over. quite understand, sorry - maybe I'm missing something. Every state reports data daily, CDC collects states.

This switch primarily hospital occupancy (not case counts deaths), I've read, every hospital still choose report state separate new reporting process, imagine still will. 

I think shady, materially stop us getting numbers state level we're currently getting. 100th? don‚Äôt see things can‚Äôt true. government announced opening two months ago officially second wave, data hospitals symptom/treatment searches indicates otherwise. Why? think it‚Äôs targeting ‚Äúlarger‚Äù western population? sure name one? Zombieland Double Tap. Right, probably citizens legal residents? missing lot population, easily million.

People going party dinners mask sight. problem. idiotic thing I‚Äôve read day They‚Äôre available covid positive patient ‚Äúaerosol generating procedure‚Äù precautions, you‚Äôre ER/ICU, you‚Äôre doctor mid level provider. average nurse floor doesn‚Äôt get one even taking care covid patients.

I‚Äôve asked ‚Äúwhat covid patient floor end coding one N95 mask, supposed CPR?‚Äù told start CPR covid positive patient ‚ÄúPPE distributors‚Äù come code. they‚Äôre expecting us compressions *covid positive patients* surgical mask, extremely high risk, since you‚Äôre face pushing chest, bag/valve mask doesn‚Äôt filter anything.

I said wasn‚Äôt comfortable all. said ‚Äúin heat moment won‚Äôt care.‚Äù makes okay. Plus, obviously don‚Äôt know think heat moment I‚Äôm going think safety safety team. defunding public education years really starts showing dark side :( Sadly complacency accepting. either fight like hell defeat fascists accept hand power. between. last four years shows complacency accepting of. hope so, current batch specifically allowed stand signed declaration support Boris (well, Cummings, toxic svengali unelected liar behind him)'s Brexit ""plans"". plan, emperor naked, they're winging week time, lazily.

You genuinely delusional actually believe that. cases every country world. every day record broken... Yeah, shops required masks long before. Yup. work dollar tree merch manager. I'm currently quarantine now, require masks, even though employees wear them. let first tell DT corporate incompetent best. least immune coronavirus right? =P clear article says. quote "" majority patients admitted acute care hospital Covid-19 March April still experiencing symptoms three months discharged. ""

The key word acute care. yes worst cases people go hospital take long time recover, already knew this. ""We plan place reach capacity, want anyone alarmed,"" Navicent said. 

Let translate you:

Yep, think one biggest companies world could take ‚Äúdon‚Äôt open‚Äù hit. We're higher cases per day March/April. Inslee fucking it. paid lip service idea reacting science, pulled back, went R = 1 700+ new cases day. Fuck him. ...or hanging Covid testing centers, hospital ICUs. Really fast track it, ya know? honestly hate saying this, hope run dry. Maybe people actually give shit something change shit hole country.  Well sure put lot trust institutions do. weather mild looks like need huge social distancing requirements get R0 1.

I've seen again. Conservatives empathize LGBT people one family, etc.. this.  


I get it, us live within circle self-centered world perception degree. Seriously though, takes tad effort though enough empathy understand care others.  


Apparently, certain people can't make effort unless forced break bubble. John McCain good thing think Arizona. hate fucking Alabama south-west otherwise. even valid without context.

The Fed even cracking southern states, southern states specifically upset Fed crack northern states returning runaway slaves. literally broke away screaming ""state's rights"" override rights northern states.

It's understand context, understand nothing lol. Apparently Yakima 95% mask wearing. people respond things get really bad. Would nice could respond sooner though. I‚Äôm sure states, state seems case work forces burn crosses. one replied to, I'm Bay Area, definitely enforcing mask rule around here. Maybe depend area. Northern NJ actually!

Stop scared numbers tell us Damn truth all. Tetanus caused common bacteria. Apples oranges friend Agreed. like find chunk like, never look anything different. got mad today news headline Moderna vaccine trial negative reactions. actually read article typical reactions get shot, headline, think vaccine worthless best, potentially dangerous. Someone read tonight go away belief Moderna vaccine dangerous guarantee it. one person fact.

Sorry ramble ... pleasant evening. Oh man, I‚Äôm sorry hear it. hope things turn around. alternatives daycare pretty much option? ""How much pay?"" Exactly graph lies dotted line. look graphs OP linked zoomed everyone seeing it: Let‚Äôs actually focus virus right focus politics fighting later. please work together wear masks get with. It‚Äôs going take time pandemic end it‚Äôs going last longer nothing, spread virus, unproductive helping virus spread more. would probably ended us gauging bad thing many people know it, instead checking scientists public health experts. 

This massive relief. ‚ÄúMouth breather‚Äù takes whole new level 2k20... Well we‚Äôre disappointed Facebook‚Äôs inability curtail fake news fake science, contributed situation we‚Äôre in. predict many crushing restrictions ease soon Orange obviously talking America.

Exactly... fact think every country world going along ""hoax"" get Trump silly. Like ignore every fact existence actually believe said. It‚Äôs hard solidarity empathy point states lack leadership government basically pinned states other. beginning surging states left compete PPE states little empathy states surging yet. Actually, many states mocking places surging tight restrictions, states hospitals becoming full. Since federal government led national strategy every state handling differently. Illinois New York hot spots finally shown huge progress result leadership precautions public. one wants decline care people states, especially people right thing, however, states begin take seriously jeopardizing safety surrounding states? Last Moderate Republican specifically talking ""paying"" people stay home part. right. work Dummy States would refuse comply. 

Though wonder passing legislation extends temporary UBI every State serious lockdown x number days would force hands Dummy State Governors. way Medicaid expansion went makes think, no. people dying COVID19 would died seasonal flu natural causes, ordering refrigerated trucks before? live TN dumb fucks still wont take seriously. work conservatives sister bf think hoax refuse wear masks. sister bf 5 kids too. virus doesnt give damn think. unpredictable. might pull weeks ventilator fighting life. nope! Let's put kids danger idiotic beliefs. There's literally reason unless Kemp actively wants people die. That's exactly point. microcosm look Daryl Davis interview, black musician literally helped dozens hundreds people leave Klan friendship talking, he'll share story Klansman convinced white people invented Boogie Woogie.

I've heard similar arguments themselves. knowledge history stops white guy developed idea, never goes back black folks created all. ""Maybe would listened worn mask, simple thing, would avoided this,"" told KTVT. ""I work bank, I'm always around people, like, 'I'm fine, I'm fine.' Never think I'd catch it."" No. AFAIK, Halyard 600 available public.

600 thread count 100% cotton. That's sold yard. sold sheets. See, biggest chain sets precedent follow (most time, follow end taking business anti-mask customers) good, damn good.

Still waiting Disney reclose places follow park street house nonstop collections bored teenagers hanging other. time see mask somebody's mom drives past (they get *fast*).

I get it, remember young stupider. also idea could done short locking next month. Wow, swedish medias really propaganda? That's frightening. good reason read foreign medias know situation Sweden. Sampling recent articles: don't, almost every siren option used PA system. idea would exempt. Every agency I've seen heard wearing masks every call. much like heat insane medicine general. Property never put people's lives. ways incentivize research development. Governments hiring experts assess contributions efforts produce financial incentives accordingly. means bit bureaucracy advocate full-scale replacement intellectual property everywhere comes medicine, comes saving lives makes sense humane alternative. Additionally governments could focus stronger financial incentive cures treatments (the opposite currently is) let experts design incentive structure medical research. Amen informative livestream Fauci millions see explaining lot debunking common misconceptions. agree stance letting politicians basically say anything want using platform good well. think liberal word ""extremely"". Also, shaking hands dumb tradition. used travel lot work would shake hands many 20 people day. can't say miss one bit. Research points toward protests significant factor surges. 

 

I would argue *non* factor, know indoors + close quarters (think: bars, restaurants, clubs) much higher risk outdoors + masks (nearly every protester saw masked up). Transparent people try hide things first place lol hit 2,000 deaths, 50% nursing homes. first big outbreak Albany nursing home. yeah, think Georgia 150-160 counties; rate per capita easily spike population tiny.

Georgia has... what, 10.62 million people? Around 4 million live Atlanta area, decently large cities, leaving many people rural Georgia. Fulton/Cobb/Gwinnett/Dekalb counties show rate per capita tiny rural counties do, we'll know we're really shit.

That said, number new cases day terrifying none said taken mean virus overblown. Speculation based Trump‚Äôs order earlier week, thankfully reversed states spiking right states biggest protests, Washintom, Minnesota, NY etc fine.

There research protest related spread: protesting lead infections, cancelled large number people stayed home protests, presumably avoid them. based cellphone movement data, see full paper agree sharing blame, would argue protests primary drivers spread, regular day day human activities are. hundred thousand protesters may look like lot people, pale compared 5.6million New Yorkers take subway every single day numbers exploded. activities, like indoor dining parties, much riskier others, outdoor activities like protests less likely cause spread. Yelling, however, risky even majority people wearing masks, people protest encouraged carry noisemakers instead shouting. No, eventually America. modify data, pull donny buy precursor chemicals? lawsuit? would think governor would sort alternate stick could beat one mayors with. It‚Äôs not. 
Sweden vindicated guys tough enough life already. make worse them. confusion resolved family members reminded her, ""Hey Abby, think billions dollars come from? parks!"" tasty coastal real-estate‚Äôs going flooding market! total win-win America‚Äôs rich. One nearly everyone inside wearing properly. They're required get inside. cops aren‚Äôt gonna enforce regulations, there‚Äôs really point them. little town mandated masks week now. think seen anyone without mask. Every store, every public place, everyone mask. hard. tourist town, even respect mask. 

However, head north 100 miles masks rarity. hard. Even 105+ degree weather. kinda sucks, better dying. Hell, even better paying hospital bill. respect others. Dumb, paid be. Here‚Äôs info today‚Äôs events Usually something gets one vote everyone jumps bandwagon. Classic reddit. Agreed amusing. Gave chuckle anyway, thanks buddy.  Well shit. happens now, legally? judge's opinion? read statements ENCOURAGING guests plan direction enforcing it. hoping customers right thing.

Okay think often claim sort anxiety nonsense. data show outdoor spread, ones hall monitors there. 30000 people protesting street = cool, 40 people drinking outside bar = rip grandma 2+2=5 explanation trans science made long time ago

 

To begin, important point many studies found structural differences brains biological males females. develop several months gonads develop SRY Gene becomes active Chromosome inhibits gonads developing ovaries. serves basis many claim sex gender separated. abnormality development brain gonad development traced back window time. makes sense considering 0.6% people transgendered begin with. note opinion, whole trans movement accepting trans people much way shame physically disabled person.

Long story short, Gender Dysphoria feeling depression anxiety comes gender brain feels comfortable as. transition typically relieved Gender Dysphoria. I'm sure guys bring comments section, incredibly false tested many times.

Sources:  third thing I'd like bring there's multiple upon multiple papers showing brains trans women (XY genetically) much like normal female brains, vice versa. paper says brains entirely like other, however, actually strengthens idea something fully understand yet occurring development sex gender. take educated guess, many factors determine sex gender Testosterone SRY Gene, change one genes (possibly crossover event X gene) might create incomplete/non 1:1 sex gender relationship. Also regarding genetics, something learned that's new read there's plenty evidence incongruity passed generations, strengthening hypothesis. trans person likely trans biological relative; little like genetic patterns found gay people. There's even evidence specific gene involved, CYP17, though found valid female-to-male male-to-female smoking gun. However, still furthers multiple factors hypothesis.

You read anything said you?

Okay, let's look integrated circuits see southern culture something invention.

Hmmm, first versions integrated circuits started Germany, started theorized Britain Japan shared internationally scientific research.

The first key processes needed make ""modern"" integrated circuits happened Bell Labs (Finnish company working New Jersey), companies labs Massachusetts California.

The first proof concept integrated circuit made fellow working Texas Instruments, national sized company guy made raised educated Kansas/Illinois. Oh even true integrated circuit would recognize today, first fully monolithic outside wired connections.

The first actual monolithic integrated circuit made company earlier California, Fairchild Semiconductor.

It seems like part anything south one single point, company one researchers worked headquartered Texas, guy came step even south.

That took 5 minutes look up. Trump terrible business. many times he, leader businesses, filed bankruptcy? 6! That‚Äôs right 6 times. happen? Poor planning business skills. guy moron people expect step lead? develop plan virus? Think again!

Seriously, would much better position fucking GOP ran senate jobs removed shit stain office impeached. Blood hands too!

Register vote like lives depend it, do. Yeah, NJ mask mandate since April, even week NYC, literally says businesses MUST decline entry folks refuse wear masks (plus bunch worker safety stuff). realize states followed suit...I thought people assholes, per usual. shocking me, honestly. lol nobody saw coming Menards. :) one thing gives hope Black Death same. Yes, incredibly lethal peak downfall. Kill many hosts virus dies well. mutated something still killed lower rate go around 1300's. reason Im saying said public trust undermined kind justification people wearing masks.

No, jumping conclusions clearly pissed want argument. one trying justify anything, get yourself. live PA tested today. get swab, Dr ordered blood work ill results tomorrow morning. Also zero cost lost ins months ago. Like experts said, done right, would look like reaction. pandemic like pulling weeds. get root, expect keep picking weeds specialized tool/chemical/vaccine created. Getting root case means destroying process organism propagate. Check state dashboard *That Stalin quote* took way long figure bags passenger seat let cities decide what‚Äôs safe citizens instead authoritarian it. store anti maskers left Hobby Lobby. Guess live candy 1950s food source. Exactly Texas awhile got even worse mandates masks everyone. know screwed corporations trying harder keep alive fucking government. Well afterall solve Middle East crisis! /s Paywall. anyone help? Median age tested positive. Good Lord. absolute dipshit. 

I found 6%! right non-peer reviewed medRxiv pre-print meta-analysis 
around 20 studies* (cluster-RCTs, cohort studies, case-
control, cross-sectional) conducted community settings 
concluded wearing face mask slightly reduces 
the odds infection wearer around 6%

Apparently, masks even beneficial claim. Note: infection **by wearer** around 6%

So protect others significantly (don't make quote more), also offer protection wearer!

You totally misread spouting exact opposite information. Holy shit.

Probably best unsubscribe. need hospital anything important next six months... Hot take-maybe educational benchmarks arbitrary focus surviving? Seems like bullshit extend America's obsession productivity children. 


Put effort check ins place especially kids need it, getting food out, etc. Followed distance learning plans. EVERYONE behind. okay. Way easier catch algebra wonder one gave teacher illness killed em. so, sorry. sounds horrific. Considering hard enough get people listen science pandemic, unlikely anyone start care climate change.

It's already late Heard one too. needs many outweigh needs few.  Pretty much situation new definition ‚Äúpathetic‚Äù. Blatant, willful ignorance leaders ever since pandemic sprouted. truth downvoted countries got railed behind months open everyone resistant  Oh, CDC go FBI website get data need. guess there's problem then. ...and sees bill 79-day hospital stay, might wish she'd died instead. Welcome US healthcare system. wearing mask someone literally yelled me, ‚Äúmy health concern!‚Äù 

I guess took offense wearing mask prevent possibly spreading anything. People tell I'm cautious I'm really worried sue. I'm believer personal responsibility, I'm curious far take people's personal responsibility pandemic. ladder analogy little off. company intentionally makes defective ladder someone gets hurt it, company *is* fault, could liable. reason things like discourage intentional harm. someone knowingly exposes virus similar liability, would affect spread virus? venn diagram groups circle. Maryland sounds nice paper, reality close lost year. College students typically take gap years travel work. Neither options available children.

What's point mayor? dumbest shit I've read today. discussion isnt whether mask order makes sense not. whether makes sense minimum wage workers try enforce customers even customers refuse. want workers customers say 'fuck you, ain't wearing mask' keep walking store. really expecting workers try stop them? employee put situation, especially given multitude stories videos belligerent customers threaten actually killed workers tried enforce masks stores. employee grocery store supposed try stop theft customer tries steal; that's job never worth worker. I'm grocery store worker, sternly tell customers trying walk without mask mask mandatory, refuse, ain't shit. I'm getting paid minimum wage, ain't risking life that, especially enforcing also increase risk getting covid too, addition increase chances getting hurt/killed. grocery store needs hire security guard enforce shit, police need enforce it, minimum wage workers. Hurricane Karen rips Arkansas, entire retail sector damaged many areas stores completely destroyed numbers same? Anyone else getting used people ignorant willing something stupid first place? like saying, ""Let's make peace once"" war. idea hella reasonable, sides (why sides?) ignore thing.

It‚Äôs ‚Äúbizarre‚Äù...Fauci simply sharing facts us pandemic advising best protect ourselves. isn‚Äôt message WH wants people hear...hence, CRITICISM!

This administration stop nothing attempt discredit man. Consider source move on! utilize delivery/curbside pickup services can‚Äôt medically wear mask indoors meets ADA standards. would still deny entry. LOL idea either. think people probably read post makes ""unpopular conservative"" something. nothing could truth. 

But......I hate say it, think need prepare another four years sick guy office. something bigger that! need work together defeat this. can't people understand that? Madre de Dios, well prepare millions die this. Nothing new. means people designing vaccines need take account. What? hear phrenologist giving exorcism/lobotomy sounded like said something rather retarded. [Nation's Pediatricians Walk Back Support In-Person [reminder guys wearing mask social distancing would cause 80% decrease coronavirus cases  guarantee Oxfords working. really confuses people take success Oxford 90% given.

Learning mistakes shows wisdom tho BMI ~35 around 35 55 years old never got diabetes. BMI 26 (at age 61)

I think often go together given. country's elections run popular vote practically every citizen knows this. popular vote irrelevant neat statistic (but personally like electoral college either). 

The fact everyone knew election system works Trump still got voted office. public was't blindsided. puts significant portion blame American people voting interests. administration llittearly refused follow every sensible measure possible telling us made difference?


Let's ignore countries manges . dropped one these: \\ calling jock, nerd. 

I'll see out. also edited recommendation afterwards, probably cite new one FL list 57 deaths instead 129. assume grandma one 57. Thing family memes 128 fatalities also assume counted 57. Since names, even initials, assigned deaths easy obscure data.  Well like %70 overweight, %30-%40 obese; according article half increased risk getting severely ill. would give essential Liberty, purchase little **temporary Safety**, deserve neither Liberty Safety. Absolutely ridiculous. Look us Massachusetts -MASKS HELP!!! 5 soon.

Go BRICKS nations!

In addition lot doctors states: ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt test deads yeah, haven‚Äôt enough tests living‚Äù. Every state needs adopt finance strategy. imagine walmart 4 months ago.

You think waiting extra 3 months responsible?  taking away rights!!!!!! think we're singular, ideas individual unalienable rights good. can't really argue way ideas expressed. I'm grateful countries (such French) helped us defining articulating freedom really means.

Maybe executed better, fair say made mistakes. None us really better others. faults. Yes US done lot wrong, good points too. think important acknowledge also get lot scrutiny (seemingly) overall areas, faults much easier find many floodlights shining us speak. I'm making excuses bad behavior ignorance, saying we're different anyone else. point view American, seem easier criticize. Perhaps long time, economy envy many others. economies world tied together, less true, still face lot criticism. justified, not.

These days, internet, world getting smaller we're getting know better. Let's hope leads greater compassion understanding. Damn, clearly way say: ""we war, massacre die someday without figthing back"" slowly proceeding direction individual companies, towns cities mandating them.

Distance learning effective younger kids. also effective kids parents completely un-concerned un-involved.

Which exactly spent end last year summer researching best practices, giving guidance parents teachers effective possible, rather focusing re-opening schools costs. matter schools open August, shut again, teach virtually. matter when, if. unless focus now, teachers students completely unprepared. Strongly disagree. don‚Äôt think liberals clear utter HATRED Trump? face call rotten orange says right there. Literally entire argument left election cycle evil Trump is...not one good thing candidate. don‚Äôt think Americans even know Biden stands he‚Äôs ‚Äúnot Trump‚Äù. 

Test question‚Äîcan name anything good Trump done far? don‚Äôt think left capable acknowledging anything good he‚Äôs done would include mask wearing applicable.

I don‚Äôt like much Democrats stand for, least say Obama positive things. Nobody completely 100% wrong everything. Anyone says biased. Lemme change headline see works. ""Florida school's closed till Monday teacher's student's test positive coronavirus"" Yeah...let's experiment future...parents let happen!!

Obesity one common underlying conditions increases one‚Äôs risk severe illness ‚Äì 40 percent U.S. adults obesity. underlying medical conditions people have, higher make guess would that, guess. need wait phase III results Oxford, general idea.

Even medium store could require dozens cameras full coverage. want able retain footage period time. requires immense amount storage space. increase capacity beyond point, get extremely expensive (and complicated) expand further. 

With fixed capacity theres trade quality footage amount time you‚Äôre able retain it. Since lawsuits issues requiring camera footage pop weeks months incident, it‚Äôs often better go minimum quality maximize storage time.

Ohh fun.. weird say study linked covid spread mainly large droplets contact (coughing sneezing) directly going talking breathing (small particles shit load). mask might something.

Another quote study ""maybe"" proves know ""possibly"" anything. 

""In respect, masks studied review reusable 12‚Äì16-layer cotton gauze masks.

I bet something it. Lol literally signed executive order forbidding local authorities make decisions like month ago. I'm pretty sure still technically place. Georgia followed suit. need resign.

Edit: maybe months ago. much shit going every day. keep calendar lose track days. live Georgia, enjoy spike that's come. governor one last governors issue stay home order says know covid-19 spread asymptomatic carriers revoking local mask orders. I'm sure weeks, he'll back issue statewide mandatory mask order ""I know recently masks help reduce spread covid-19"" Deaths increasing 5 states hit hardest now.   PEDO!!!! Actually inequalities going emphasized pandemic. Says anti masker. bet think trump ‚Äútrue Christian‚Äù wish could send Covid truthers there. really legitimate hope left. bs numbers theories, actually plausible. actually makes think NY, Connecticut, UK examples places mostly shut vs April, staying there. NY blows bets off. also think travel big problem. Say NY hits 45%. bunch sick Florida visitors come in, back spreading again, slower.

Also, worst case immunity wears couple months, back races. britians plan? Shelter elders let virus run population? fire managers refuse enforce it?

Will ever enforce abiding arrows floor? really. taking note massive numbers deaths happen time pneumonia forth. argue.
The deaths likely absolutely insane fair predicting, that's small part improvement care hospitals giving new knowledge rolls out. Still, deaths happening rate rate increase system continues overwhelmed. ever discussion, let alone reality. Well issue didn‚Äôt know was.

#GLOBAL FUCKING PANDEMIC whole situation crazy. People willing put kids risk beyond understanding, homeschooling might best option. ...and promptly remove 3 strides past door. Yep, factors, ones - listened BBC Economist podcast today private health system really appropriate circumstances. political ""leaders"" !

I've shopping policy. No, sell wish. What‚Äôs petty tyrants sentencing citizens death? point posting chart. lies masks came precisely optimal time maximum compliance. don‚Äôt believe motivation ascribe totally accurate. supply chain, could told Americans start sewing masks. Instead said *those* also deadly.

The chart suggests lies pushed recommendation mask wearing high adoption phase high resistance phase one surprised that. Yet another missed opportunity incompetent government. Please. enough people mad enough pressure DeSantis retire attempt sort recall remove office. Since people willing wait next election replace DeSantis, things bad make be. customers!  Read Medical Loss Ratio regulations learn truth health insurance profits. Today Aloha one required enter 100% compliance. GOP gaslighting success.

I'm NYC, family there, all. know bullshit, breaking me. really allowing people die. governors get lie. Like cvid kills people NYC pneumonia deaths soar. fucking horrifying. Mask bouncers sounds like could get real sketchy real quick lol thinking horrible company profiting misfortune others, wrong.

Insurance company profits regulated government. Google Medical Loss Ratio learn more.

They're going start getting rid contract employees, shut non essential programs likely lay workers order comply Medical Loss Ratio requirements. ""It's weird hill die on, least dead"" unreal. 154 deaths reported yesterday likely none happened previous 24 hours?

Does anyone supporting information support refute? invested significant amount money car makes feel safe. actually drive much days, that's good point. know many laws around safe handling cars? restrict much behave roads. actually get license use one! cars registered, make sure government keep track them. laws safety features like back cameras headlights. cops roaming around constantly making sure people follow rules cars dangerous.

And cars STILL dangerous, need hospital system care injured. unchecked pandemic obliterate.

It's hard. anywhere be. Wear mask anytime try give others space. Wash hands. get sick, comply quarantine contact tracing. end world, work keep taking over. still way less work car safety. handle yourself! state government overriding local bans masks, they'd arms ""big government."" least Canada , Walmart‚Äôs ‚Äútap‚Äù feature terminals paying. touch buttons.

I'm sorry downvoted speaking truth It‚Äôs official: Trump cronies bad CCP It‚Äôs GOP thing. Canada‚Äôs liberal government also mandated masks yet, ever praised left-wing paradise Norway. Opposite New Orleans, listing Coronavirus deaths unexpected keep death rate open sooner people want wear mask, anyway social pressure, realize also wear mask nobody confront them. Slowly surely, going people walking around masks. 

The solution pass laws require wearing masks, like requiring seat belts. ""encourage"" people wear masks. Put jail don't. get everybody comply. Clear laws, consistent enforcement, stiff punishment. Wrong. working hand hand police assignments good relationships departments across south florida. numbers fluctuate squads get quarantined testing. anything pulling people dumb shit anymore.

Popular vote easy, John Quincy Adams elected house electoral college split 4 ways nobody got majority. 30.9% popular vote wasn‚Äôt even leader Electoral College went Andrew Jackson got 41.4% popular vote.

So guess many many people running splitting vote could theoretically win even less vote...

With states carried gets tough far back number states changes, 1960 JFK 22 states vs 26 carried Nixon, though popular vote also went Kennedy 0.17%. Lucky nice metaphor. Think O2 Han Solo. Think COVID Millennium Falcon. Now, choose penetrated Han Solo Millennium Falcon, would choose?  think it'll get high. There's countries handling badly Point wearing mask restrict airflow uncomfortable people like me. Anyone trouble breathing, unconscious, incapacitated otherwise *unable remove mask without assistance* wear mask. 

I suffer breathlessness stress heavy activity EXCUSE WEAR MASK. Sometimes suffocating easily remedied like finding safe place breath. Getting covid much worse little issue.

At least able breath much air mask could without mask (with speed breathing). somewhat like running high altitude. dangerous run breath faster. effect much pronounced N95

And air breath contain CO2 it'd otherwise.When rest breath in/out ~0.5L air probably much mask capacity, CO2 build much Yes also like people getting tazed long like me. also live well funded community, one wealthiest Massachusetts. drugs go away violence stop, changes heroin fentanyl cocaine percs, random street fights domestic violence. Next upvotes. I‚Äôm BaconReader explain further? lol yeah, think CT benefits perceived ""boring"" state that's famous Yale University

Not alot people willing visit CT honestly think government intentionally committing ""soft genocide"" letting spread unchecked vulnerable communities. Wealthier people generally work home, isolate much easily, access better healthcare, nearly worried this.

Our government schizophrenic. CHI NUH remember days 1,000+ cases nationwide seemed like lot... that‚Äôs nothing. numbers look like 3 months now? riot one guy shot cop.

But 100,000 killed pandemic? lives matter. Essentially, yes. I'm Texas. 10,791 cases reported today. mean 10,791 people caught Covid today; means many cases confirmed today. Within number, might lot people went test recovered close it.

It somewhat explains hospitalizations ballooning setting records cases deaths, yet rt number getting continually closer 1. great sounds without armed guard doors still tons people going without masks employee going confront nutjobs like that. would great employees allowed pepper spray anyone without mask face.

I‚Äôm picking sides here, evidence? threshold get one released 50% effectiveness. time percentage effectiveness increase adjust it. Looks like Kemp Team COVID fucking idiots....all them!  Specifically gravity physics teachers situation. Yes!  r/iamatotalpieceofshit hahaha, shit dude. I'm best maths population, 1000 UK per day COVID deaths roughly 14.9 deaths per 1 million population day. Converting population size US would equate 4887 deaths per day. yes accounting pure statistics US look path go even higher previous figures, however would utterly devastating US would reach heights 4887 deaths per day. 

UK currently 664 deaths per 1 million population, first wave. US level (baring mind vast majority deaths period month so) they'd 217k deaths currently. UK hit far harder people consider, even country worry US Brazil company UK haha. 

Worrying signs guys though, still first wave look per million cases similar statistics us :(. rule prep club don‚Äôt talk prep club.

I'm sure thing they'll look phase 3, also reason need *have* phase 3 start injecting people now. already thing?!? live temp constantly 40 45¬∞C bronchitis breathing problems. Wearing mask fine.

It's like can't win losing. sure feel sorry nah Aw damn, 500 people died communism Texas week. employees wear first? 

Wearing around chin yell buddy across aisle spew spit customers doesn‚Äôt count. opportunities career growth. Trump get handle routes tracking cases. sure start going .  I've running grocery store whole time gotten nothing, even get stimulus Buy AC filter home improvement store. similar n95 filters. Cut shape pocket put there. good 10 hours use least. without doubt become political issue. conservatives seen reason, opposition still almost entirely side fence blasted conservative media. 20yr old memories 20yr old self feels very....well, shit I'm sad right actually. called normocephalus. rare. real. Let‚Äôs fight fire fire, people like don‚Äôt wear masks type people call police state black people barbecue telling put dogs leash.

I realize won‚Äôt. Wishful thinking. one hope.  party 4-7, got sick week later. Rodney wont anything unless Walmart does. yay guess good luck getting management enforce rule. need think watch Fox News. going suggestion like Sam's Club enforced?

Although mandatory Walmart Sam's Club, customers simply say need mask. let's guilt Kroger paying employees more. thank friend! mostly police BLM. kind totatlly ignore corona. mask policy since early April supermarket work. firm it, workers management others backs believe got blood w. antibodies 2 months ago.  Even Kroger standards. Texas pfff ;) Fauci truly experienced focused expert. Listen truly experienced focused expert. What? Mariano‚Äôs chain Chicago shop regularly. Customers almost always wear masks correctly. It‚Äôs employees wear chins. one enforces anything. me. framed hamburglar pickle tickler. Already hearing people posting facebook may wear going take pull inside. sure hell hope store someone walking around making sure followed. Also camera ban store that. rip advance die trying enforce this. NEED ARMED SECURITY implying masks important healthy people wear

No. 

No not.

They said enough data make official conclusion whether healthy people wearing masks would significantly prevent spread covid. 

They detailed benefits healthy people wearing masks.

They detailed potential risks healthy people wearing masks. 

This all. 

**YOU** thought meant ""implied"" masks important healthy people wear.

**Stop blaming inability understand clear language failure communicate part WHO.** teach district, JCPS. I‚Äôm relieved. classroom tiny, sink barely works, it‚Äôs hard enough teach normal setting due high emotional/behavioral/academic need. also worried elderly lunchroom staff.

The diabetes observations new, early conclude correlation. cause coronavirus, probably seen, 'flagelles' surface. intended mimic cells, fooling immune system believe virus one cells. flagelles mimic cells primarily prevalent lungs, cells also pancreas, parts central nervous system. exposure COVID, immune system learns attack cells, look like this. result immune system keeps attacking lungs pancreas even virus eradicated system. yet unknown long effect last.

Again, people knew this, maybe would take seriously. ""just flu"" narrative clouding peoples judgement. I'm sorry already suffering diabetes! people like need take virus seriously protect other. glad taking precautions. also taking precautions can, hope efforts protect well. Ah yes, remember people rising comrade Lenin, told wear masks. /s ""Less lethal"". People less connected areas often living worlds news take filtered partisan lens. closest thing might real news lot places local newspaper gutted private equity firms, Sinclair-owned local news station. Beyond that, Facebook algorithm chooses show them. That's concern. White House wanting control data directly. could easily change numbers suit narrative.

America wants outfudge China's numbers. One multiple likely widely available early 2021. Maybe December 2020 we're lucky. Compare COVID Malaria, second.

Malaria caused parasite, extremely small (larger virus, believe, still tiny). common way protect malaria infection put mosquito net around bed. holes net certainly large enough parasite pass through, offer protection? parasite float around really, carried mosquitos. net blocks *carrier*, protects infection.

Same Virus. Sure maybe float around own, could slip cloth mask, usually hitches ride something larger (such tiny droplet moisture dude aisle 5 sneezed). mask blocks droplets, protects infection.


It's perfect comparison, neither method guarantees absolute protection respective infections, incredibly small step take amount protection offered.

-note: saw comparison elsewhere Reddit, credit goes whoever was. put words. Kroger largest supermarket chain US? That's shocking mandating masks lol Gonna steal sound like boss conversations thank you. Ok requiring wear masks, requiring worn correctly. 25% people cqme work today wore masks chin, 50% wore mouth, rest actually wore correctly. fucked Get ready wild videos.

Asymptotic, you‚Äôre less likely spread. long you‚Äôre wearing mask temperature checks good metric time being. easy say 

often people start sentence ""It's easy say X"" set contrasting point like ""but really true."" expecting follow ""because X proven way &amp; way""

Primarily, numbers game. US 330 million people it, compared far less European countries. Despite thousands labs throughout country, labs equipped test amount people wanna get tested states getting hit hard.

""Well states since beginning pandemic bolstering capacity?"" may ask. becomes personnel issue equipment issue this. lab still waiting several pieces equipment ordered weeks months ago would increase capacity nearly thousand tests per day. imagine situation similar across country - many labs need equipment reagents there's enough go around. may problem countries consolidate testing fewer labs.

Even *do* get equipment, still need hire train new people run tests. Clinical lab science, molecular biology, microbiology arent super popular programs US huge population people readily hire train short period time. That's also ignoring fact high complexity testing - run equipment needed process samples run test requires fair bit training get people running. they're new lab. working hiring people, almost strictly process samples dont time run testing train new people important part testing process.

I realize relatively benign symptom, know someone still sense smell taste 2 months later. Bolsanaro? Get Covid.. recover say oh Covid ain't nothing mention impact Central Asia (especially) Middle East! Also, suppose changed, event Black *Death*, caused bubonic/pneumonic/septicemic plagues. hospital today getting pre-screened surgery next week. saw multiple nurses staff same. healthcare workers aren‚Äôt abiding basic safety rules, damn sure grocery store employees aren‚Äôt going either. Oh get data directly HHS won't. One co-workers second job Dollar General. trying enforce state mask mandate, manager told would written asked customers wear mask. Can't cut profits. work Kroger. large corporations really still giving hazard pay? realized shitty wear mask apparent hazard get hazard pay. Unrelated, call Kroger customer support one night change online order, customer service agent, heavily accented gentleman West Virginia, discussed recent deer rifle purchase me. would they? store policies law.

What's viral submission? white house getting data directly lies end. /S Basically masked employees shoppers looked like asshole.  Peace talks, enjoy :) another way super soon. Yeah parents would okay great chance kids would fine too. Hells Bells, people annoying Whaaaattt? could guessed?! Scanning groceries necessary; touching u/swooopyy's grocery card/keys not. try avoid extra shared surface essential? There's probably pretty low chance transmitting virus surfaces, still non-zero chance (well, according I've read, science virus constantly shifting). I‚Äôm sorry. That‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous.  even saying? know racial, need act. can't believe say this. Who, REALLY, problem wearing masks? see typical Karen articles annoy people bitching them, pretty easy comply damned request. simple.

I live pretty conservative area, I'd say that, least, 85+% people see stores wear masks. 

Places like Costco require them, have, whole time. me, problem it, place wear mask I'm outside away others. Like gas pumps trail something. ""No Shoes, Shirt, Smask, Service.""  one thing outside apartment go gym. single respite this. lift heavy honestly feel like safe wear mask, lot time I'm already breath. know could lower weight, I'm pushing get really bored. compensate risk, go 4-5am. maybe 4 people entire gym they're normally least 20 feet away me. asshole wearing mask? taking unnecessary risk?

And death human being! Elective surgeries expensive decreased significantly year due pandemic. seen refunds, insurance companies paying high claims people health plan. ACA requires health plans spend certain amount claims claims paid year, refunds happen

Edit add - insurance companies actually incentivized efficiently improve health populations. example, health plan identify people risk hospital admissions high cost care nurse work people better manage care, save health plan five figure hospital bill. discharged hospital, make sure care coordinated end back hospital, expensive. Also, die, health plans longer get premium you, likely pay expensive end life claims. many issues healthcare industry, health plans win members sick die What? Pot guy peak could wide plateau ""Mouth breather!"" *klak klak klak klak klak* Yeah, tiny part pretty much put every country headlock hm yes floor made floor One many pet peeves people (teachers!) would write phrase ""pneumonic device,"" idea . thought PHU Ontario would call 2 week mark ask symptoms went away? time related. That's rather point - lack statistical literacy. Daaaaaaaammn bet exposed plenty ladies Streptococcus  Captain trips say anywhere article? 

It says interaction outside home even saying weapon not.  guess heat uncomfortable hell little reward. like idea masks security theater- used there's going person person contact. think Uber Eats drivers wear picking up/dropping food due required contact, think wearing car, instance.  State numbers hogwash too, GOP states like Florida massively undercount save face. Deaths ""Non COVID Pneumonia"" sixtupled point, middle SUMMER. relatively one cares death statistics begin with. However, mass shooting scares shit people many people violently lose life lot tragic. Comparing virus deaths even heart disease deaths shootings way frame scale people (Americans) thick understand simply. *Guns enters chat* problem number US alone reached large enough number average Joe sixpack can't visualize number really even looks like.

I actually digging comparing understandable things. Google Rice stadium, capacity 70,000 seat. first superbowl Houston played (I think). Pull black white photo stare it. suffered equivalent close every single person photo killed, twice......and less 5 months time.

Second test. Read Hiroshima realize one August day suffered 70,000 dead. Five months later hit 140,000 dead.

We willfully ignorant people (US) suffered effect time line equivalent catching atomic bomb freaking face. absolutely mind boggeling look prospective.

Rice stadium. packed rice stadium looks Compare photos no.5 no.24 todays positive infections alone would overflow rice stadium lumped one place.  Lol, usa pure selfish form. soon find many people vulnerable electing anymore. labs/hospitals pass test data directly state health department even sending there? shocking, yet see someone might get point read headlines subreddit I'm Massachusetts, got bad early. get watch, horror, states act fool selfishly get everyone sick. deaths 2 months ago? mean backlog reporting? that‚Äôs first presented symptoms? remember 4 years ago seeing video American saying government healthcare whole life got sick, lost job saved understand important.

Seems things degraded since then. Hey, respect spirited conversation. intention getting argument here, throwing opinions around. 

The Reddit style passive aggressive handle plus I‚Äôm rookie yeah, there‚Äôs that.

Unfortunately, US isn‚Äôt going get act together unless:

We're literally midst worst global pandemic century union leaders still stop work wonder longer hold power. study it, family lived it. Communist rule, whole nine yards. We'll agree disagree assessments. choose bit optimism ability numerous highly intelligent capable individuals around.

States can't trusted enact orders, federal government able to. bad can't trusted either. Countries easily close borders idiots. States, much. think states report right? Shame 390 cases norm *city* U.S surprising. Boredom, social isolation desperation drug dealer's best marketing tools. Especially things like AA/NA less available addicts, they're available all.

Hell, I've probably smoked weed (legally, I'm professional grower licensed patient) last 3 months last 2 years. Possible - deaths lag 4-5 weeks. trough seeing ~20k cases day. 3% ~600 deaths per day, pretty much bottomed out. far off... Death typically lags two weeks behind diagnosis (assuming person gets positive test one week infection, actually pretty generous assumption). basically predicting Florida 45k deaths end month, even though deaths suggest Florida much lower CFR Britain (indicative better testing therefore lower number actual infections).

 RemindMe! Two weeks Tremendous. Truly, Best. Bigly covfefe.  Im asthmatic chef wearing mask whole shift making head explode feel like don‚Äôt get enough oxygen. way I‚Äôm taking lol wave

FILM 11  So, quick google search yielded population children US somewhere ballpark 74-75 million. 0.002% 75 million 1480. Considering study alone able already find 300 children inflammatory issues, children yet return school, infection numbers still rise, nowhere near peaking, can't help think 0.002% estimate bit off.

Regardless whether 1500 children more, lives really worth season highschool sports? *anyone's* life actually worth it? certainly think so. Pretty embarrassing taken long major companies making steps Meanwhile, Florida... problem might also concessions restrooms. either open one person could infect dozens. US might highest rate currently, overall #23 tests per capita (although trailing microstates count).

Anyway, point link makes scaling testing number cases, population, key. would think, explain NYC. Viral load must factor contracting virus. say court show satire prove insane? 30,000 dead okay. encounter like Canadian. I'm glad live States right Greater Los Angeles area 18.5 million people real question infrastructure exists even setup

To properly would require time (4 months) lot money. federal government saying states districts ""what need help?"" rather threatening withhold funding. carrot rather stick. 

In country functioning federal government, four months would used get virus strongly control in-person education could reopen August parts country. Instead, states school districts massive budget crises trying Apollo 13 way online learning avoid All-Maskless Martyrs' Brigades. 

So, no, infrastructure exist setup. Ive asked before. 100% consider invouluntary manslaughter. god. literally going say words wrote. 15 times March... also going add feel like I‚Äôm stuck loop.

And seeing comment, basically confirmed yes, stuck weird time loop. Damnit. Deaths lag behind nearly month. take account time takes person show symptoms. (2-14 days), time get tested results (24 hours week), time get severely sick (possibly another 3-10 days) time hospital death (varies), another day days death reported.

You're easily looking LEAST 28 day lag person catching COVID, dying, reported.

All people saying buckle save college sports fall delusional. needed buckle May. fucking late now. Yeah think I've little bit panic knowing another 9-12 months cold get here.

Nearly rational people think gyms closed almost everywhere, indoor dining.

Ultimately, gyms indoor dining closed months, along schools, malls. virus overrules arguments like ""but economy,"" ""but children,"" ""but child care,"" ""but distorted view freedom.""

We going take-out, curbside pickup, delivery, maybe able get back 50k day (after spikes 100k people selfish, petulant children hold onto faux freedom like security blanket). Huh? 1 new case mainland, imported. Seems like pretty good news. Where's confusion? bad ""normal"" much ""paranormal."" extremely negative world view right now.

Oh ive seen that! Dr. Wolff great :) Even without Covid, wear full face mask! Yup. someone mostly stayed home, kept small (mostly outdoor) groups people, worn mask everywhere public last 4 months...I feel defeated.

And less month schools opening 100% capacity parents audacity complain masks required. Teachers going die.

""Well, cases low compared places!"" say. Well yeah, that's great right now. First, live Nebraska. Outside Lincoln Omaha population density jack shit. meat packing plants stopped reporting cases like month ago. middle summer people *CAN* socially distance outside, schools session since March. OPTIMAL conditions limit spread, numbers even ticking back up.

What people think going happen 42,000 students return school next month? Magic?!

It's infuriating.  That‚Äôs like, entire class wiped out. guess 30 kids don‚Äôt mean anything you, it‚Äôs pretty disrespectful families cavalier them, especially since seem expect others value needs child.

Also, 30 deaths aren‚Äôt factor. It‚Äôs also might spread disease to. don‚Äôt know long term damage covid might children get even mild cases. Lived El Paso Walmarts hired security dudes front door store. Mostly shooting better security assholes good idea. Beautiful do. we're trying universal healthcare workplace democracy. pessimistic? [You‚Äôve already study lists canada 41% usa 63%. wouldnt believe single thing reading that.

It simply isnt realistic number anything I've witnessed canada anything I've heard friends states. roughly 95% compliance subway system I've never seen person store without mask, certainly like usa.

Whatever data draws make graph straight faulty.

Yeah, source utter claims 60% americans wearing masks april. Ask sounds correct. also claims mask wearing Canada gone multiple mandates wear masks public transportation, public places government buildings.

Even funnier now, lists us mask usage 74%. Right. Lots, lots lots roads, pretty much none checkpoints, barely markers crossed state lines. people protesting wearing masks lockdowns already, think going happen start trying turn away borders. Replace tourist terrorist makes sense! Fauci isn‚Äôt overseeing response pandemic. Pence charge White House‚Äôs Covid 19 Task Force. one charge overseeing US‚Äôs response. Pretty positive mom picked Covid local WallyWorld. good move part. can. question whether they'll reason back... Right. might worst side effect though, evidence protection yet. 

And long term problem: approve wildly unsafe/ineffective/problematic vaccine now, much would damage vaccination efforts enable anti-vaxxers future? end killings millions measles polio vaccine caught collateral damage?

Clinical trials follow progression good reason, pretty horrific examples learned past - might NSFL (Theralizumab). remove comments facts change  culture rugged individualism turned selfishness, social media spreading misinformation speed light.

Some Karen‚Äôs convinced bullshit Facebook memes wearing mask decreases oxygen levels hurts immune system, thereby increasing chances infection.

Some think wearing mask cause breathe recycled oxygen, leading CO2 toxicity.

Some people think metal strip masks antennae receive 5G signals spread Covid. 

Others want throw temper tantrum someone telling do. event organizers one super spreading event away realizing willful negligence much cost. guess point better let get worse trump admins eyes mean people wanting vote mail Nov. people vote mail votes touted suspect cast doubt whole election. rate guys going need split first wave 5 phases something properly describe events kek Also Texas here, business still refuse service regardless ‚Äúmedical conditions‚Äù faith based excuses. I‚Äôve done times Wolfe uwu compare one group deaths another reason...people dying reason either unable stay home going way go break every known thing know protect virus. tragedy think real numbers.

almost 1000 Americans dying DAIILY hooked ventilator alone one two people 70000 sick enough get tested. comprehend real understandable numbers. Think 15 shooting day killing 60 people time wounding 70000. 

Wear fucking mask, social distance, stay home watch movies end world please. Capitalism never great system normal people long run, first place. Check out: lady** aunti fa..? I'm guessing talking people reasonable. serve evidence *against* strengthening peer pressure mechanisms? prove *weakening* peer pressure best idea?  one list Walmart (Scent Theory Keep Clean). used flame test method, flames perfectly blue - indicating methanol present.

Nothing political.  competent government public follows health guidelines.  Seoul 6 new cases today.  13 nationwide.  rest imported and, yes numbers growing but, they.... getting screened entry ports airports mandatory quarentines testing everyone

Edit: got cutoff mid sentence posted took call I'm outsider I've following US COVID news personally think whole US economy needs hard shutdown (like NZ did) good 6 weeks (as long takes). virus largely suppressed, phased relaxing restrictions (like we've Australia past 2 months so).

That said, Trump likely would likely lot backlash happened (this America we're talking about) military needs get involved it. Yes would hurt economy economy fucked moment anyway.

That's take anyway. That's big IF. thought Kohl‚Äôs going business last year Would like help making list best indicators predict follow spread. example:

Web searches som keywords
Demand goods increases
Emergency calls regarding shortness breath
Wastwater testing
Sentinel testing

What else? Hoard TP, forget TP IANAL (just dude lot free time) use pop legalese below, happen keep walking Petri dishes whole bunch loopholes:

I would absolutely love northern/western (read: sane) states low infections able ban ones gigantic coronavirus spigots. would bet money least *some* Governor someone his/her administration asking privately option (which, presumably, led compromises I'll mention later on), *sharp* divide states handling things well ones not.

The problem banning people different states entirely literally unconstitutional federal law. Article IV Constitution outright states that, Privileges Immunities Clause, visitors states union treated rights dwelling there.

The compromise safer states demand isolation visitors returning residents states high COVID cases. come, sure, loophole possibly exposed COVID-19, isolate whether live there. unconstitutional, applies *everyone* might exposed, whether traveled state.

The way *that* works another Clause article Constitution stipulates known ""full faith credit"": essentially, means residents of, say, Florida, must respect differing laws New York might apply Florida, Floridians prosecuted New York, state Florida *must* respect New York's decision must overturn judgment.

So hypothetical scenario occurs: family four Florida decides want travel New York. Prices low flights virus. find would quarantine fourteen days upon arrival. They're deterred coming. They're outright banned, would unconstitutional, would treated way woman Albany would tested positive COVID-19 told mandatorily self-isolate. Similarly, family Rochester traveling back visiting family Tucson. know self-isolate return, home contacts help gather groceries essentials shelter place.

In way, New York laws apply equally woman Albany, family Rochester, family Florida. effect, law makes non-essential travel prohibitively restricted *imply* ban, *actually* ban. *can* come, better place shelter risk heavy fines penalties. non-essential folks that.

TLDR: constitutional ban people states, loopholes, make *de facto* bans.  like 11 cases yesterday, 34 day that. numbers bit higher, R number 1.2 full reopening delayed August 10th. 

The priority focussing schools reopening end August. 

Our government cautious it‚Äôs comforting. We‚Äôve daily peak nearly 1000 new cases back April, lockdown cautiousness effective.

I‚Äôm wondering new Covid app we‚Äôve released here, also partially blame increase cases. 25% population already downloaded, notifies you‚Äôve come close contact confirmed case get test. It‚Äôs probably finding lot asymptomatic cases would‚Äôve gone radar otherwise.

Plus, things open, restrictions. go pub 2 hours, table service food too, example. comment incoherent incomprehensible, except parts wrong. 

Your posting history cesspool. Blocked. mask affect economic Americans wear masks ask thing anti-mask Americans. won‚Äôt vaccine hands everyone wants one 2021. mention don‚Äôt trust Moderna one iota. want another share pump execs sell end year. company hasn‚Äôt made single product masses existence gotten anything clinical trials failed, yet somehow cracked vaccine Covid-19 seasoned companies researchers did?

Many Americans dream one day becoming monster feeds carrion Americans dreams futures. nation sociopaths making. country here. Don‚Äôt avoid travelling please.. Millions people go Disney summer. Wow go quarantine every flu season too? know like literally deadly coronavirus healthy young person (that say deadly all), right?

Like mortality rates healthy young people infitesimally small. smart reason ""social distancing"" protect (given healthy young).

If elderly relatives really care lot old people yeah makes sense, holy heck people still jerk coronavirus ""deadly""? Nah I'm referring 7 day average, weekend delays impacting all. % Positive also slightly still wayyyy high. Great show USA-2020/2021 know question... But... YES Gotta number 1 something. someone seceeds could invaded

Even neurological main cause death percentage cases. Although excessive immune response singled cause symptoms, evidence suggests virus directly attacking brain. Spanish Neurology Society (SEN) compiled recent studies carried Spain connection coronavirus brain entire nervous system. sample varied, research focused alteration senses smell taste, work headaches suffered infected toilets, following 1,600 infected patients looking strokes. work greatest impact so-called ALBACOVID registry. study neurological manifestations observed sample 841 patients admitted two hospitals Albacete (the university capital one Almansa) worst pandemic, throughout month March. results, published specialized journal Neurology weeks ago, show 57.4% developed one neurological symptoms.

""The neurological spectrum vast,"" says head neurology service University Hospital Albacete co-author Tom√°s Segura study. Among common symptoms myalgia (muscular pain nervous origin), headache tides. also noted almost 20% infected patients studied presented disorder consciousness, although symptom concentrated elderly patients. Another 20% patients (not exclusive groups) developed neuropsychiatric problems, insomnia, anxiety, psychosis. ""Some symptoms, myalgias, insomnia headaches, observed previous studies,"" adds Segura, also professor University Castilla-La Mancha.

Yeah might teach lesson next time, sadly dont learn, they're already walked around store, infected people possibly standing line customers, point I'd want fuck store soon possible standing around talking waiting manager. 

But totally get situation in, last thing make sure get point, rest company enforce. 

I'm grateful work small vape store. Literally owner, literally tell customer go fuck long give somewhat decent reason did. 

Our mask mandate starts Friday work alone really nervous confrontations customers, I'm girl 20's working alone boss agreed mask entry service policy, end story. 

If cant wear one curbside pickup, gladly bring stuff right car, way possibly getting sick, ESPECIALLY boss, lives two elderly people, pregnant wife due anyday now, son still toddler. 

Thank trying best get situation in, people dealt LONG becomes problem. 

Thank everything do, I'm canada apprechiate people running big grocery stores stuff get food, seriously, thank you. Problem kids turn super spreaders, friends, family, grandparents... problem 70%‚Äôs efforts get invalidated 30%. Regarding first sentence: overall known covid-deaths already like 4% known cases US? 3.600.000 cases, 140.000 deaths. 5% mortality rate known positive cases ICU full much stretch think. hope comes true. Gosh, like supporting Trump mindlessly much. guess polls much even Turtle.

I worried 3 months Trump remain *power* loses Election. worry agreed conventions expectations behaviour losing incumbent might actually enforceable, Trump overridden sorts conventions. I‚Äôve never heard kroger Now, intrigued. explain it? French/EU passport well Israeli passport. family lives Israel prefer go mental health reasons, despite fact friends could probably find temp work.

My plan go Sri Lanka while, they're closed. could try Turkey somewhere EU I'm worried ""stuck"" somewhere alone really able afford it.

This sucks. anyone campaign ad shoots gun pickup? feel relevant change anything, believers still believe mean use same, logical system rest world uses? Extrapolating way many syllables him. Great comment! :)  SW WA mask compliance super high. still outliers, Skamania last week people even masked up. don‚Äôt want guys here, stay home!!!! lie say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think everyone wear masks save hospitals. ‚Äú what?

What happen control? 

Just wait vaccination threaten measures people want to? people buy it. schoolyard rhyme takes back days unilaterally invading foreign countries killing hundreds thousands brown people. wonderful country have. Yeah, late February March can't remember sure, Chinese medical experts study this. Ain't gonna happen. Americans want Americans we're gonna filling ICU beds, millions losing insurance, people losing homes cause work die.

America great country...

...thanks Trump. Oligarchy peak NY 430k confirmed. assume 10k actual cases. say 4.3 million. NYC likely higher, closer appears. Still far though. Germany kind bouncers front large supermarkets made sure everyone following rules. 
That also gave people security business job clubs closed. Huh. grew there. Know exactly area is. Never went there. hope get shut down. It‚Äôs infuriating us Americans board right thing whole time. us embarrassed associated would love emigrate. Mask compliance Maine seems mirror political beliefs and/or intelligence level individual. Also, oldest population country, Maine seniors multiple risk factors likely mask compliant. wonder includes Fred Meyer, part Kroger (Am wrong this?) folks wearing damn masks Freddy‚Äôs go to. Infuriating. anti-viral? get see Karen Kevin freakouts. They‚Äôll yell ‚Äòtrump2020‚Äô lot. nah that's WD breakdown cases find information? blanket covering all? presume case anywhere asymptomatic severely ill? say 99% cases range asymptomatic mild illness, reaction different day 50% cases severe. wait another week find out. get I'm saying moron stop trying clever   would first world country best healthcare system universe need thing? smells like crisis actor me. ^/s stood outside Walmart said, ""fuck you, hope get sick,"" everyone two months, everyone would still think asshole stopped. That's basically Walmart did. deserve pat back something ethical companies months ago. high school dropout fuckers need downright CHARGED child abuse essentially protesting children get sick. 

I real education would scared even come near one uneducated, brain-dead plague rats.

To actually wearing mask, thank right thing. Someone walk idiot DeSantis ICU full COVID patients without mask! Welcome science. powers politicized everything much, spewing lies, people think they're either lied to, think they're it. US, people value individual comforts desires greater good. one knows ""suck up"" right thing, think there's anything them. 1000 deaths month staing 800-900 range U.S. screwing us over, rest modern world still pretty much fighting virus.  Good thing Disney magic! magic fucking way keeping new cases parks without closing. wont change minds. dumb rocks find another reason One purposes Phase 2 look effectiveness different doses drug vaccine. called ""dose ranging study"". pick dose best combination effectiveness safety put Phase 3 trials much larger sample. get second flu shot December January, too. You‚Äôre generally limited one per year. get pneumococcal immunization time. Honestly think public general good better employees. 

It‚Äôs comfortable wear day employees I‚Äôve seen don‚Äôt even cover noses. covering nose like tying coat around waist.  

People like talk customers employees bad worse.  I‚Äôve yet see retail fast food place least 50% aren‚Äôt covering. Many Uber drivers don‚Äôt roll windows either. Average person think way better. things make good stories. That's ridiculous. use title ""Dr."" referring Fauci. Mind boggling. shit fuckin dangerous also run risk compromising life financially US. Like thought process ?! Haha know Fox news would behind this.  It‚Äôs sad probably need add word ‚Äúproperly‚Äù end statement. 50...what daddy! Woof. Fauci, longest time contradict Trump directly. smart move enabled reach public extended periods time press briefings. believe main goal. Deborah Birx also similarly restrained. However, way remember it, briefings stopped around time Fauci became available press times outside briefings. nasty little accusations directed towards right happened, doubt originated administration already trying discredit him.

I find still incredibly respectful president considering he‚Äôs treated. he‚Äôs made clear us isn‚Äôt going lie. regrettably seldom see integrity action lifetimes, payoff watching man. trying help us. true even knew name. Yeah... tried convince colleague, kept sending shitty journal articles. sent videos, articles actual health care workers, answer ""there's always going someone tries disprove things anyway really care stuff"" guess won, closed ""I going wear mask mandatory, still marketing trick sell masks."" wait...people actually thought masks lowered oxygen levels...what Loving villainous looking black masks. That‚Äôs nice üôÉ worry numbers go soon since CDC get reports anymore. America‚Äôs breaking records like bull vinyl shop fair trust American data, begin with. dog story represent COVID? flunk high school?  It‚Äôs ridiculous it‚Äôs necessary. Japan EVERYone wearing mask. Nobody turned political issue. got back April...mild case affected gi tract lungs (tmi. watery acidic diarrhea ever lol) barely fever, went away couple days days it, short period. Symptoms were: fatigue, headache, fever, nausea, vomiting (only twice), diarrhea, coughing, mucous secretion, loss appetite, minor muscle pain.

Even though mild symptoms harsh, stuck quarantine 5 weeks; first 2 weeks bulk symptoms went away except coughing. tested negative finally towards end May got positive antibody test still find coughing spasms today...and hear lot people lingering effects sick. Good luck try get it. White House? Wall Hack? Imagine ice cream that's OK there's much costs double would expect pay it. trying kill constituents?  I've made similar mistake myself. hope stay healthy try hard yourself. enough stressors add angry ourselves. 

Also - congrats (baby way)! Sending positive healthy vibes!  April. Thought say April. well may still right /s  must've Zen-Master previous life able stay calm around idiots Okay everyone, back school! /s tf lies coming from.

social media love fact completely ignored despite science behind models showing previous pandemics results etc.etc. people seem convinced ""this it"". warning shot. terrorism spoiled child adult form. terrible, something address, terrorism. Trump resign. Almost ~4 million Americans die year. 2020 probably going see estimated ~5% increase death compared 2019 Pneumonia"" sixtupled 

nothing see here, totally unrelated folks, move along now. COVID cured, another deadlier epidemic spreading US: Anti-intellectualism. I'm doubting cured. Europe little mask usage / compliance besides public transport. less 10%.. honestly couldn‚Äôt tell quenched virus. atleast UK there‚Äôs far, far less care home deaths originally start pandemic making anywhere 80% deaths. prime minister said public investigation. Lots rumours covid patients care home paid incentives take covid patients homes clear hospital bed fear running beds never case. Covid patients care home vulnerable, regardless precautionary measures taken results deaths like we‚Äôve seen.

Life *kind of* returning normal. Although easing restrictions areas, next week masks mandated shops. Local lockdowns imposed. Recently city Blackburn (population 140,000) restrictions tightened ‚Äúsurge‚Äù cases (114 cases TWO WEEKS). rather 8 cases day. 97 cases southeast Asian heritage, deaths reported due covid area. terrorist attack trying help terrorist win wearing mask. Also, post-viral syndromes like already crippled millions pre-COVID.

In serious form, people unable live ordinary life, bedridden dark room light sound cause pain, others potter around house crash fatigue, inflammation feeling unwell days overexert (take short walk, housework, spend hours computer per day).

People position often condemned life extreme poverty social isolation.

Those income disability insurance denied claims, falsely defined insurance policies psychological disorder avoid payouts. Insurance companies fund bogus psychiatric experts push narrative undermine research efforts (ditto Gulf War Syndrome 9/11 Responders).

There 10x people MS, many people worse quality life people MS (some worse quality life people last weeks life AIDS/cancer subsist decades). Yet, historically received less research funding male pattern baldness. treatment cure, research barely done (but making headway last despite underfunding).

So, catching COVID-19 definately worth risk.

People injured current pandemic unable claim disability pandemics usually soecifically excluded policy. Regardless, also likely dismissed psychosomatic even denied government pensions. , everyday like surreal waking nightmare. wish stores would hang sign saying something like this:

No mask entry!

ADA (Americans Disabilities Act) require ‚Äúreasonable accommodation anyone cannot wear mask due medical condition."" Meaning get curbside pickup, deliver accommodation. need let in, fined.

CDC ADA requires us protect employees customers, pandemic follow guidelines. 




They seriously dont need let people in! wont fined! plain STUPID üò≥ No, earring, right heel, WAY WAY worse even legos. thing is... one asshats ‚Äúchooses‚Äù kid wear mask, they‚Äôre actually choosing kids exposed kid. freedom? Freedumb all! get casket, get casket... Caskets everyone!! Better chance vaccine falling Trumps ass.  Pay wall, please anyone ???? Actually already promising vaccine that's shown pretty amazing results lab rats pattern emerges.  know kids make crapload mistakes whether 21 12 right. 

You know, I'm ex-kid myself, yet one know killed members family time. r/leopardsatemyface local Kroger, Fred Meyer, people pretty good. Every time get least one bitter old person MAGA hat wearer walking around like dick. 
I'm glad stores going this. Ebright scientists mentioned article someone believes virus started lab even though evidence pointing Whoever downvoted suck it. Governor Beshear win. 100 people died Chernobyl disaster maybe comparison isn‚Äôt strong enough already manipulating data? 130k death rate keeps staying hearing statistics like 50k new cases per day. numbers already add up. Gov. Abbott entered chat....and competition. Thank god, unemployment pay people working make.  new made public, except instead infertility, need say causes impotency. watch anti maskers scramble find catch limp-dick-arona. think helps us blue governor relies common sense science. still old guy we‚Äôd screwed. expect happen pack building kids. Certainly military level disciple obedience. getting groups people room good idea. I‚Äôve learned years insurance covers doesn‚Äôt cover significant influence business behavior decisions. 

The takeaway lack coverage COVID-related risks big factor whether sports fall happen not. 

A factor. One several variables. BRING BACK LUCKY‚ÄôS. üò≠ Anyone wears muzzle clearly one ruling lizard people. doctor trusted. information lethality virus lying, prioritising people saving people obviously logical approach. I‚Äôm pregnant actually cried released mask mandate weekly public briefing last week. I‚Äôm thankful live state leader trying damn hard. That's promising, need complete phase 2 3 trials know vaccine works.

Edit: downvoted stating fact, nice. They're thing. joke, learn use /s. times demand it.  Congrats, superpower heightened wheezing. Fathers Death get downs country nothing country. explains lot. dunno, man. They‚Äôve done stuff didn‚Äôt even think possible. Lol, think it‚Äôs going get better?

Perhaps consult actual scientists say situation. someone ears? Obviously extreme it‚Äôs thing could think would rational argument. Like couldn‚Äôt hang loops anything. I‚Äôm guessing part included cover medical scenario less specific purpose. 

If think another one would love hear somehow question stuck head haha. Littleton, home Columbine. 20+ year old event Americans remember vividly. 13 people died. Yesterday 997 Americans died covid. get peoples can't conceptualize magnitude this.  know get? people think they're gonna stick Fauci (or CDC, WHO, whoever) wearing mask. endangering people's health prove point someone correcting course face new information? Talk shooting foot... ...okay? would them?  ?

What's point?




These particles TINY. small even respirators block them. fact, would miraculous did, knowing know viruses spread predominantly respiratory system.

The particles float around outside mask area, stay there. eventually come contact humans/animals. stop breathing avoid inhaling miniscule portion. would take. responsible people like give idiots like that, significant amount, cover keep doing. Reckless gun owners hide behind responsible gun owners. case, ""responsible"" truly consider yourself.  Yes, everything black white. Place head back sand please can‚Äôt hear you. Reduce World population to.....5 million? 

There 5 million people Earth since 5000 BC Ha! Poland even possible subscribe Disney+  see one person wearing mask race (besides drivers crew etc) Keep rolling, keep beating drum. matter listening. feeling lot white collar management layoffs come pipe onces folks notice little work many people jobs ting handful actually gettjng shit done. ""Let's Stop Nonsense""

I vote Biden's new 2020 slogan. Yes. that‚Äôs untrue. UKs initial reaction similar current situation similar rest Europe (just took bit longer get there). 

Just evidence we‚Äôve recently reopened pubs (at least England) around 500 new cases day less 1% positive. Don‚Äôt know peak positivity cases around 10 times higher. USA largely reopened cases dropped around 1/3 peak still 20,000. 

I‚Äôm saying won‚Äôt 2nd wave notion making mistakes USA ill informed. goads bunch guests smashing holes hull. republican run states let caronavirus run rampant. No, none current vaccine candidates contain Covid genetic material behave like virus. Oxford vaccine Covid spike grafted onto harmless virus enter human cells. Beijing candidate use dead virus. live vaccine (weakened version original virus) sometimes trigger actual infection, Covid dangerous people try make live vaccine it, especially looks like safer options going work. trials. start 6 months test. vaccins safe already, sure side effects wait least 6 months. work around this. 6 months really pushing believe. example want really sure doesnt side effects example pregnant women better least year. Decades science? Sarah Gilbert making joke? gonna get infected anyway. Lets style. ""Small government"" Worldometer 167/100k Sorry idea Boris started taking seriously got ill popular Reddit, there‚Äôs literally zero truth it. It‚Äôs spreading misinformation needs stop. absolutely change policy sick. already full lockdown place illness. critical mistake UK made delaying lockdown week, troubles followed one decision. It‚Äôs also worth remembering actually follow scientific advice time. It‚Äôs worth questioning poor, recognised week earlier, it‚Äôs like way dismissive situation science. sometimes think British leftists jealous don‚Äôt Trump complain about, given amount material provides US, pretend Boris basically same. He‚Äôs far perfect even vaguely similar Trump intelligence, ethics, policy, ideology basically anything really. Claiming he‚Äôs insane nonsense echo chamber thinking. even mean? He‚Äôs exceptionally clever, even people intensely dislike personality politics never really disputed this. Except children Reddit think you‚Äôre unhinged, idiotic nazi don‚Äôt accept whatever currently fashionable extreme left utopian policy is. Even Reagan let shit go like this...

And know Bush Jr gets kinds shit, bungled like either. fact, I'm pretty sure he's looking thinking, ""and thought fucking stupid."" I'm part! What‚Äôs problem? Thank you. I‚Äôm sad every day wish people cared other. sincerely hope bad actors get served charges over.

Willfully harming public health MUST severe consequences country survive America. also available non-anticoagulant varieties

Or take non-anticoagulant version. double negative it. top doctor beginning pandemic everyone knew little.

Which horrible mistake need held accountable for.

When don‚Äôt know, correct thing say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù, ‚ÄúMasks don‚Äôt work‚Äù. experts ashamed themselves. hmm Yes  Thank efforts. see anti-science time Facebook. People thought smart posting crap virus end November 3. Science eludes them. numerous studies high patient numbers giving absolutely credence HQC. 

South Korea even published study HQC given *before* onset symptoms set patients difference mortality speed recovery Control group. 

That someone still *believing* HQC making people downvote guess. Safe effectively reflect autopsy ‚Äúnatural‚Äù cause death. nearly every post US

That's Reddit you. Unless country/region specific sub, things tend US focussed demographics site.

Also, situation US getting worse worse there's talk about, much rest world things getting better, there's less talk about. Ohioan here. think (and hope!) governor warning us don‚Äôt CHOOSE wear masks now, may shut things again, including in-person schools sports. quite eloquent speech, think *subtlety* warning may gone people‚Äôs heads, unfortunately. Yeah everyone dead there's noone fertilise Good thing science help people understand thing. American knuckles memes plz wonder tell Trump fact, would probably yell you: Fake news! Liar! kills sick can‚Äôt wear mask, probably shouldn‚Äôt public pandemic without mask.  There's reason walking around mask,"" infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci told 60 Minutes.

While masks may block droplets, Fauci said, provide level protection people think do. Wearing mask may also unintended consequences: People wear masks tend touch face often adjust them, spread germs hands.

~Dr. Anthony Fauci 60 Minutes masks supposed lower oxygen levels anyway? There's space mouth mask hold volume air lungs breathe out. possible CO2 build behind mask.  man it. much respect him, put plethora Trump administrations bullshit still focusing task hand. knows covid destroying US wants put stop sake us families. planet living on? see crap like whose worldviews consist Facebook memes conspiracy theories and/or braindead Fox News garbage. Good luck, bud. I'm already making immigration plans. Well pay people money work, bonus money nothing free time spend lol. news?  work full time whole thing make way less would unemployment can't even afford pay bills usual, let alone spend lol.  Darn heck work industry people need :(. I've lost much money free time, could spending money instead risking life make barely enough survive!  Life silly! inability listen anyone demons norm around world. people use surgical masks even better ones hand. still emergency situation, people even use better masks properly need them. think countries resources abilities provide daily supply (because good masks single use only) PPE citizens delusional. Yes may also cause blood clotting, heart failure, brain tumors, skin rash.

&amp;#x200B;

Blablabla. I'll take 'Things health minister say' 1000 I‚Äôm still hoping won‚Äôt issue. rate we‚Äôre gonna get sooner later. society collapse starve. hear lot lately. must feel pretty good lapped Mississippi 

Thank God Georgia? God nothing bad administration. Let's change #unity2020 trump say summer heat would kill virus? test takes 2 weeks come back positive likely negative time get it, negative could positive gave false sense security tomorrow. Honestly think able cheat much.

Imagine schools opening swarming covid time. Everyone dog talking it, see 50k per day nobody gonna believe hospitals 100% overwhelmed I‚Äôve thankful Beshear since beginning. pricks getting way left right simply traitors. true! embarrassed governors . say makes difference.

From last week this, gov finally mandated instead suggesting, asking,pleading,reasoning wear mask... saw compliance two stores visited go 10-15% 95% more. Thank said scientist try Yes, places (states/ counties) seem handle fairly well. see benefits independent governing, opposed German system, cases like quickly become disastrous.

Glad hear least somewhat safe. competition politician worst continues. ""HAH! believe oxygen?"" heard fine long post comment so.  However, pride taking ding ""insulting"" category helps protect elderly person, person co-mordidity, person compromised immune system, single person earth, getting sick dying, mind insult.

It though. seem disregarded everything else said. masks least common denominator person, snot-nosed mouth breathing coughing sneezing everywhere jackass.

Let's pretend going permanent way life forever. would insulting lot people also statistically unlikely positive. COPD advanced matter anyway, they're already going supplemental O2 delivered mask. 

Also, they're probably going anywhere public, time point walking across room like 500m sprinting average person. think mandate masks required close contact others public areas cannot maintain 6 feet safe social distancing. fairly easy space suburbs many recreation areas (including beaches), gets really iffy dense urban sidewalks tourist spots like piers boardwalks shopping arcades. grey area ppl seem taking advantage go mask-less. want cover say they're maintaining 6 ft spacing they're really not, they're forcing others veer bike paths parking lanes avoid them. live (in France) usually security anyway bigger stores, like grocery chain. big burly guys, always them. want challenge that, could ever find reason to. stern culture, limited public emotional outbursts. People usually respectful boundaries, mostly. Remember months earlier world condemned chinese fudging numbers?

Well well well, look turntables... wife works dental. Using N99 mask would migraines day work feel like shit. moved using two masks guy using said BETTER perfect. know reduce oxygen increase co2 sure. use masks stores - get dizzy 20 minutes one.

&amp;#x200B;

Also worth noting guy standing single spot moving around. Ok y'all, want know buckle up. need do? Wear masks, get flu shots. else? Get life order write/update wills, living wills, etc, yes. else? loads scientific studies intersection race, medicine, health, policy. studies could developed carried CDC. studies used inform policy reduce medical inequalities disproportionately affect people color. CDC would excellent place develop evidence-based policy. state too, ruidoso swarmed tourists rich Texans normally come winter ski, spare houses couple months now. None wear masks. Im listening anything Drump administration says anymore, ill listen Fauci. best way solve freeze bills owner would need pay business, choose stay open money cause building rent stopping. hell governor put pressure banks freeze collections debts right now. Sure didn't. Yet unemployment suddenly stopped Virginia 2 weeks ago. Weeks extra $600 supposed run out. also supposed receive extra 13 weeks unemployment. Wanna know many times I've called VEC HELPLINE trying find what's going since 5th? 1987 times. Know many times I've gotten ""all representatives currently busy assisting callers, please try call later"" wading 4 menus automated speech? 1,987 times.

I making little $20/hr coronavirus shut us late march. employer reopened, much like factories southwestern Virginia. 

However, here's thing, spent extra $600 helped economy produced taxes. 

Local employment offices closed due governor mandate, yet we're phase 3 reopening restaurants full capacity gyms open employment offices closed? I've written letters representatives, governor, senators. 

I seriously question Virginia's unemployment rate majority people worked facing thing. Still unemployed, longer receiving benefits.

Here's what's hiring currently.

Pizza Hut, Dominoes, Valero 

Pay? $8.25 tops. germany - Atilla Hildmann &amp; Co. Thankfully relevant amount people. Gay communities, people dropping like flies people care 'gay' disease. China hasn‚Äôt opened movie theaters yet consider delaying next year People refuse even wear pants wal-mart, freak videos gonna great. see now: obese grandma wearing panties screaming ‚Äúyou‚Äôre telling wear top mask?‚Äù asthma I‚Äôm 33 w pregnant even without mask home shortness breath sometimes days wearing mask outside home doesn‚Äôt make difference breathing. I‚Äôve wearing masks since February. breathe fine mask on. point, funny even putin Orange County... cant expect better people. Lived two years, basically Florida inside southern California That's really great! I'm glad hear it. matter many tests prove idiot wrong, they'll still think they're right. Even overwhelming evidence claims, easier argue person admit they're wrong proven, idiot can't even admit lied. need emphasize voluntary. 

Your right wear course important anything. least one priapism, opposite ED. post history South Carolina. scary part comes paly, virus over, society going left behind? realized shirt shoes service require pants... That's economy gonna tank even couple weeks Republicans get way cut off. mean, point MAGA slogan anything visual warning complete fucking tool area anyway? like openly announcing interaction total waste time. 

I even mind anymore. sort wish everyone obvious capabilities. hope problem end generation orphans kids messed losing parent. entirely disagree. However, pride taking ding ""insulting"" category helps protect elderly person, person co-mordidity, person compromised immune system, single person earth, getting sick dying, mind insult. 

It takes effort, little effort, three simple things might help others, mind. 

Socially distance.
Wash hands. 
Wear face covering. 

The real complaint experts agencies, GLOBALLY, given LOT conflicting information. believe due much China controlling supply chains world, unscrupulous information needed study pandemic, also gets medical supplies, drugs, PPE. 

Fauci said EXACT reason he, himself, advised masks necessary. CDC said this, recanted, said again. still clear answer. That's frustrating. 

From personal perspective, major surgery 3/16. day state initiated stay home orders. doctor extremely worried, recovery ward ALSO covid ward, hospital in. Believe me, compromised immune system, listened tio every guideline taken seriously. 

This bug kill me. kill grandparents. kill diabetics. hypertension. many people. 

Thankfully, many people taking seriously. blame current resurgence placed republicans, without even remotely accepting FACT millions Americans completely disregarded warnings went protest, riot, loot, patently dishonest wholly deceptive. silver lining mortality rates still low, cut regulations get treatments there. 

My philosophy will, harm none. think part could potentially harm someone, so, me, things thought least harmful.  ‚ÄúAt CDC, powerful platform create real change. declaring racism public health crisis, agency unprecedented opportunity leverage power science confront insidious threat undermines health strength entire nation. Yet CDC must clean house first,‚Äù emphasize.

They lost credibility this. Ok, racism declared public health crisis. fix ""leveraging power science"" ?

All sounds like written idealistic college student. notion american government credibility chinese russian one , ever credibility propagandized decades , take time dispell notion. Sadly, pandemic speeding things along CCP troll tell causes impotence, 99% wearing masks vaccine two weeks. Bullshit won‚Äôt happen MO. thoughts exactly. read book 1 year ago, discussed English professor. discussed topic fertility (we close, brought up, I‚Äôm gay fine) expressed thinks near future, thinks fertility rates plummet. 

I think dramatic, took statement grain salt. don‚Äôt know studies come saying fertility rates drop like crazy, I‚Äôm sure might one there. 

It‚Äôs total coincidence, comment made, it‚Äôs crazy look back on. serious question: ffp3? ffp3 (ffp3 =n99) wear ffp3/n99 mask 5-6 hours, safe? build wall around them. Everybody capped population therefore India would take easily complicating matters, Gov. Doug Ducey, Republican, authorized local governments implement mask requirements June 17

Nothing like tested constantly ppe like mad, cursed knowledge statistics. couple days post test coupled waking anything resembling symptoms much stress. know chronic stress does. Meanwhile fellow man refuses lift finger name misguided politics. people fucking idiots, also fair say they're getting mixed signals national leaders. national leaders take virus seriously, they?

Unlike many countries (not though, South Africa example another place boat), harsh prolonged lockdown didn‚Äôt work. India‚Äôs daily cases steadily, fortunately rapidly far, increased since mid-March.

I really don‚Äôt envy people make decisions manage virus there. mix massive, crowded population limited healthcare infrastructure quite dangerous. fact virus spread pretty well national lockdown local lockdowns/quarantines means potential absolutely explode like worst case scenario article. heartbreaking stories Delhi Mumbai hospitals India yet report 1 million cases, can‚Äôt imagine 60 times current total March would go well.

While explained fact going US currently, think unhealthy development. people US normalizes state affairs, cuts comparison countries. also makes seem like there's nothing done covid. Also, perhaps US debate becoming increasingly simplistic hyper-focused strange stuff like masks (which central issue Europe), rather important issues regarding hygiene (wash hands often) social distancing (not physical distancing!).

Perhaps people US saw regular reports normal life coming back many Europeans, reports *they* managed outbreaks far, reports *they* deal masks / rules - perhaps would make US debate bit sane, provide perspective US. Exactly FAUCI hi said numeros times healthy adults,ts dont need masks. Fauci said fact wearing mask actually hazardous. reason they're waiting so, so, so, long make mandatory period 22nd used sad little jerk ofs stock weeks. make fuckton, lose relatively customers, pretend care.

Fuck Kroger. absolutely correct pretty irresponsible governors there. call anyone else ""paid troll"" believing Federal Government United States largely responsible disaster seems unfair. try thoughtful discussions (and occasionally try funny, ill intent), strongly believe Trump surrogates [spreading almost nothing [trying anyone spread lies.

So, want respectfully address point:

If saying United States (as single country) incapable coming together (again, single country) pursue unified strategy defeat pandemic simply country consists 50 states, let's see compares similar countries across globe. 

We'll start numbers. exact people born world, infected dying COVID-19 every minute. numbers change want illustrate vast difference way rest world handling compared US.

The US population roughly spread unevenly throughout 50 states. US currently almost [3,600,000 total known cases 140,000 deaths due virus. That's nearly 1,100 infections per every 100,000 people US 43 deaths per 100,000 people.

[Japan 47 prefectures (like population 126,000,000. country, Japan 22,500 total cases 984 deaths. That's 18 infections per 100,000 people 0.78 (less 1) deaths per 100,000 people.

As 15 July 2020, nearly 1,600,000 cases reported entire European Union/EEA UK, including 180,000 deaths. That's population 513,000,000 nearly 50 different countries. Every single one countries divided various (it varies country country). we'll combine illustrate 50 **actual different countries** handling vs. US.

Back EU/EEA UK, 310 per per 100,000 known infected 35 people per 100,000 died COVID-19. 

Also keep mind countries got hit hard time scientists knew **less** disease spreads now. countries instituted mandates citizens (not all) cooperated mandates [""flatten federal governments countries leave individual states flail succeed. fact, neighboring state flailing about, state likely negatively impacted state's poor behavior, even state everything right. look data, US country trending upward, one remotely close US number cases, deaths upward trend rate infection. 

We stand alone regard.

So, argument 50 separate states cannot possibly bring disease control like 50 countries, numbers would suggest otherwise. Further, want apply logic Japan, 47 prefectures, entire EU/EEA nearly 50 separate countries, numbers also show US singularly dropping ball. reason president applying campaign lies misinformation approach pandemic applied every aspect life, [before 

Additionally, much world able ""open back up"" hard work cooperating accepting certain restraints freedoms order reduce infection rate together. continue observe social distancing, wash hands, wear face masks prevent spreading virus among them. 

It interesting note, however, 195 countries world, US citizens welcome total 16 places (14 countries two British territories). 

If still think I'm trolling you, [please consider family lives Nebraska, live Oregon. check states numbers every day. convince family member hold 20-person baby shower indoors last weekend. people thinking? Yeah live germany seen infiltrating ""anti Corona"" demos lately (from video footage online course) Actually going avoid surge giving covid data White House task force instead CDC... basically happened asia

most already lifted lockdown 2 months virus¬†is called ‚ÄúSARS-CoV-2‚Äù the¬†clinical illness¬†is called ‚ÄúCOVID-19.‚Äù¬†. people distance mask up, somewhat covid, Infections FLu really low. never wore masks country, think people scared wearing fall could 4-5 months late, isn‚Äôt. Long ago, four nations lived together harmony. Then, everything changed Karon Nation attacked.¬† Hotel work still going 90% occupancy guests make ask put mask every time see them. You‚Äôre right. flub years involvement. COVID spreads exponentially, talk ‚Äúrates‚Äù also flubbing. meant initial comment back napkin comparison. 

With said, it‚Äôs like 138,000 deaths/3,480,000 confirmed infected (since must first COVID, die COVID). We‚Äôre hitting 4% mortality. WW2 mortality servicemen 2.5% (400,000 deaths/ 16,000,000 servicemen). little 1% Americans confirmed COVID +. could 25% end year. Even 1% mortality, that‚Äôs like 800000 deaths, eclipse American WW2 deaths. think we‚Äôre order magnitude.

Edit: words clarity. supposed treat equally valid?

Yes, like Galileo's treated equally valid made discovery. mean ultimately correct equally supported evidence. ability make argument hindered, position initially valid, made process using counter evidence invalidate it. Simply making counter argument less supporting evidence make statement invalid.

Someone's opinion valid proven otherwise. like presumption innocence. innocent proven guilty. someone says something factually incorrect respond evidence idea thought somehow invalid less meaningful counterargument. disease name COVID-19.

Masks regquired public transportation moment really enforced probably 99% wear one.

&amp;#x200B;

Because people normally long supermarkets air ventilation system good. different crowded places people stay longer air ventilation bad.

## Abstract

BACKGROUND: Whether degree SARS-CoV-2 spread via airborne route unknown. Using data collected health care worker interactions hospitalized patients COVID-19 illness, calculated transmissibility SARS-CoV-2 via airborne route. OBJECTIVES/METHODS: Healthcare worker interaction SARS-CoV-2 infected patients tracked using real time location system March 18 March 31. value q, transmissibility expressed quanta per hour, estimated using well-established model airborne transmission. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence among tracked HCWs 2.21% (0.07-4.35). Transmissibility estimated 0.225 quanta per hour, well well-characterized airborne pathogens. Simulations demonstrated risk infection substantially reduced increased ventilation rooms. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, findings suggest SARS-CoV-2 well transmitted via airborne route controlled conditions. speculate SARS-CoV-2 may opportunistically airborne, transmission occurring via droplet methods. feel like Texas surpass 150 day end week...

But, large gathering large gathering, doesn‚Äôt matter. There‚Äôs reason we‚Äôre sporting events people wearing masks crowd. concerts, parades, nothing outdoors not, masks not.

We shouldn‚Äôt picking choosing we‚Äôll allow. politicians correctly telling us stay home shouldn‚Äôt joining protests. makes sense. studies academic/cdc sources reference? Texas governor thing. Specifically said word overrides local mayor mask ordinates.

Weeks later, Texas bursting cases.
Governor got TV blamed mayors forcing towns wear masks.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Well pixeleyes followed well enough agrees me. seem want discuss keep shifting topic. nice day. It‚Äôs cognitive dissonance. People pick choose information matches worldview regardless accuracy. strong belief thing big deal declining rate death something cling fits belief system. It‚Äôs like climate change deniers using cold winter region evidence hoax despite absolutely enormous amount scientific evidence isn‚Äôt. I'm sick making everything worse. would really simple stop getting blamed problems would simply stop causing problems... live one competent states disease taken seriously. Consequently, life fairly normal outside minor inconveniences hear about, like wearing mask. Despite working biomedical research alongside clinicians local hospitals confirmed suspected cases facility.

Now mom lives Florida, one states actively trying exact opposite everything supposed pandemic. scared leave house nobody wearing masks everyone sweaty angry time they're stuck Florida. Georgia's new mandate affect this? Khol's stores Georgia allowed enforce this? able they're private company? Florida man - ""Hold beer, rookie numbers"" party embezzling country's funds rich friends time America bankrolling America. Believe me, wish wasn‚Äôt true  yesterday hospitals Athens, GA full diverting patients. It‚Äôs gonna get ugly. many them, mask... principle told do. /rolleyes ‚ô•Ô∏è Prompt reinfection (i.e. immune system effective) seem happen. 

Long term reinfection different story and, group viruses, likely. children overweight? There‚Äôs lot America. still opening schools lol? also question football spectators fall. answer bit amusing. FHM said better following rules. is, social distancing, washing hands, staying home sick. better chances football crowds.

BBC also asked question second wave immuntity (in english).   Denver.  death people ""refuse send kids school teachers call sick"" Cue screaming Karens Monday! Pshht...your ""health"".. anything help employer tough time? Lazy selfish entitled bastard.

;) thought prolonged immunity function whether and/or B cells ""remember"" virus whether still antibodies. forever since I've sort biology course might wrong. Best episode 2020 It‚Äôs not. hate science hate experts. Trumps extreme manifestation republicans pushing long time. Oh look found one! *is* magic word. thats absurd. Sure! country Sweden, example, presents deaths corona official numbers. means anyone dies tests/tested positive virus, counted.

- deaths reported Swedish Public Health Agency persons laboratory-confirmed covid-19 diagnosis died close connection illness, ie within 30 days diagnosis.¬†This means may died unrelated cause, also people die later process counted.¬†This measure works well influenza surveillance conservative measure deceased, says press secretary Jon kind implies numbers ""too high"", I'm trying say. go. understand need act critically, respect it! Bill nye holds three doctorates 3 big science universities. ... said ""probably"". Even know yet.  Walmart sells food, medicine, toiletries, etc., etc., etc.

The bar offers nothing NEED pandemic. good small business lose livelyhood? good employees lose income? No. midst pandemic bad things happen.

If don‚Äôt act appropriately, won‚Äôt anyone patron small businesses anyway. People smart. see family friends getting sick and/or dying, won‚Äôt go bars anyway. History proven this. soon saw KLB called Trump, Kemp‚Äôs new ‚Äúanti mandate‚Äù made sense brain.

It‚Äôs disgusting. knows Trump admin wouldn‚Äôt react well wasn‚Äôt calm - would escalate longer point is. It‚Äôs dealing toddler 101. feel mostly agree. People absolutely normalize obesity. main point overweight lower levels obesity, significant differences people's body compositions.

I run 8ish miles 4 days week, can't 100 consecutive pushups, two sets 50. Appreciate concern though. Even worse. middle ground fallacy. always assume compromise push means people compromise take advantage. pushed meet halfway move. supposed meet halfway reasonable one. adopt position. na√Øve. enabling worst people. know science. They‚Äôre pandering voters. charged murder. sacrificed **20 years** life. 20 years!

Every time encounter anti-mask, viral hoax, flu, anti-vax person need remember spitting sacrifices many like Ms. Papadimitriou made. 

These people called publicly shamed. Front line healthcare workers **dying** actions jerks. kids can't go back school them. economy shambles them. ""respect viewpoints"" situation: time name shame imbeciles shun society. Exactly going say. anything, numbers far inflated; they‚Äôre severely undercounted. Yes, is, thanks.  one responsible health well except you. Period. Wow, I'm sorry OANN reliable all, truly fake news. must difficult discern what's real what's regards media. Try Associated Press BBC take look help understand reliability different media outlets. 

 

Good luck man problem that. nervous new vaccines created record speed. Moderna‚Äôs isn‚Äôt one would personally willing take come January. I‚Äôd feel lot comfortable JNJs, Oxford‚Äôs Murdoch/UMC one. rights individuals make decision. I‚Äôm first line ... want safe proven longer immunity couple months without requiring boosters. clear misrepresentation- downvoted simply using statistics, downvoted claiming Florida handling coronavirus better most. yes loads countries way million can‚Äôt even go outside? thanks. kakistocracy/kleptocracy embodiment worst-case Dunning-Kruger effect. literal know-nothing despotic God-Emperor sincerely believes knows literally everything anyone else planet. level incompetence virtually infinite. fucking pissed people beat ""deaths declining"" drumb ignoring lag new cases new deaths.

Its goddamn argument whole time. ""its america"" ""there's 5 cases"" 
""deaths decline"" 

I care political leanings are. stop trying wish fucking disease away, actually fucking contribute solution. Universal mask use far number one priority. think anything else comes close. think summer what‚Äôs hurting us Texas. It‚Äôs damn hot everyone wants cool air conditioned spaces... help spread rona. 

Winter may blessing us since generally doesn‚Äôt get cold part state. Maybe super cold snaps couple days that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm 4th year PhD student aviation human factors engineering/psych 5-year grant researches literally concept risk US Nationwide Airspace Management System (basically predict overall risk air travel using like 20,000 interwoven real-time data streams). would badass incredibly insightful efforts could applied COVID too. Definitely not, certain vaccines, like Imperial College‚Äôs, use booster shots life No, there's big problems government resource. least confirm digital attacks going like crazy.

I use government based resources work, they're going every couple days. insanely maddening. theory people looking way get serious data, related anything covid based never seen kinds attacks before. slowing everything big level  I‚Äôm disputing can‚Äôt gain weight calorie deficit. one is. simply oversimplification ‚Äúcalories in, calories out‚Äù isn‚Äôt whole story it‚Äôs pushed food industry (coca cola, nabisco) obvious reasons. 

And again, no, laws (because there‚Äôs one) thermodynamics referring CLOSED/ISOLATED SYSTEM.

The first law law conservation energy states total energy isolated system constant; energy transformed one form another, neither created destroyed.

You‚Äôre understanding ‚Äúisolated system‚Äù crucial there. human body isolated system. energy coming *in* necessity. 

Argue caloric reduction want. won‚Äôt wrong. stop torturing meaning laws thermodynamics. Maybe shut downs, social distancing, masks 25% holds. sure know happens without policies. Smart idea. one thing anti-vax/flat earth/anti-max idiots running around...it's quite another charge.

Moron. Thanks work  Walmart said hiring ‚Äúbouncers‚Äù man entrances enforce policy. sure stores though.

Doesn‚Äôt apply us Michigan since already statewide mandate masks public places. $500 fine complying added existing mandate Monday. Mask usage stores basically almost 100% matter go. getting bent shape this. Answer questions
1) even 100% sure fault? article says ""believe"" took mask of? 
2) know dad first spread family?
3) dad bad shape covid....covid known worse affect pre-existing conditions already, issues worked on?

You guys sound like bunch liberals. wrong going party? Yes. sure one infected family? No. dad went store, took mask contracted spread family.
The moment guys hear someone went social gathering took mask off, oh automatic blame. even knowing anyone else family went anywhere could've took mask infecter. Yakima‚Äôs workers primarily essential workers. ones risking infection packing fruit King County residents delivered Instacart hide homes. 

Show respect. deaths. Don‚Äôt forget deaths! US given up. written March. There‚Äôs tons evidence hybrid airborne/droplet transmission. Superspreading explained via airborne transmission. today's generation thinks heavy burden wear mask keep distance strangers. WW2 generation called Boomers, ""the spoiled brats God's green Earth.""

bear mind also ""greatest"" generation children generation reacting way.

thank service single started, :(

I mean, probably would've regardless, lets blame pandemic failings. people refuse wear masks problem? think it‚Äôs getting sheer number people door it. England 1.5 million people flu jab 2018/19 population 55 million. Scaling operation nearly 40 times won‚Äôt simple. second reply one threads........ downvotes statement?!?! depending much info collected tests might readily available, and/or might lot labour-intensive put together, useful without breakdown.

A simple grouping age also illustrate many children get infected, compared adults. course, might wrong, impossible obtain information like age occupation. 

Alternatively, possible that, given current politics re-opening schools, somebody decided combining adult children put large number headlines create impression 1000 children infected daycares centers? 

Nah... Us entertainment industry would like get back work sometime soon. Seemingly end sight, worries me. One artist Australia told doesn‚Äôt plan touring America 2021. need get shit together. That's target audience. target audience people like us, know climate change real. wants us start electing resposibile leaders instead resigning inevitable. target responsible leaders may made half-hearted attempts pushed far enough, target uninformed undecided. People like children justy entering adulthood know much issue could actually slow it, people never really paid attention keep hearing ""climate change.""

She knows damn well can't change fascist's mind logic empathy, lack capacity understand either. *exactly* CICO lmao

If hypothyroidism let's say burn 1400 kcal day. eat 1400 kcal, maintain. 1800 kcal, gain. 1000 kcal, lose.

If start taking meds suddenly start burning 1800 kcal, lose 1400 kcal maintain 1800 kcal.

""CICO"" rule. matter *how* burn more-- whether exercise medication-- burn consume lose weight. would much prefer medicines actually stops virus replication vaccine.

Immunity novel pathogen kinda like expecting grow gills flood coming. one antimask speaker subsequent Board Supervisors meeting declared: ‚ÄúWe Orange County heart resistance.‚Äù

Good luck California. ""The deaths going up. could happen?!? Bu..buu.bbuut Ron DeathSentance said would never happen. Could lied open economy get Trump's favour? liberals 5G Chyna conspiracy kill Murica!!!"" 
 
Seriously really bad, going get worse. Even Florida shuts today, they've got two three weeks raising cases due testing delays virus' incubation period. month rising deaths. feel sorry everyone living that's sane wearing masks staying home. like punished others sheer stupidity though fault own. Best luck everyone stuck there. core isnt open exposed core cannot open exposed comrade. No, governor's policy target specific ethnic religious group. said black people can't wear face mask, case. Hell yeah. Give super soldier serum.  agree - unfortunately lots people agreement though. I‚Äôm NYC + everything we‚Äôve gone last months it‚Äôs beyond many people groups casually eating hanging crowds going parties. You‚Äôre definitely correct even businesses open doesn‚Äôt mean necessarily risk going + getting sick. 

It makes sad bc many people mentality ‚Äúif get sick, get sick‚Äù without realizing may semi-permanent even permanent health conditions follow certain diagnoses + point don‚Äôt understand virus enough find gets sick + why. haven‚Äôt outside one-bedroom apartment since February + I‚Äôm wishing leave house I‚Äôm also much afraid getting sick due health conditions + don‚Äôt want rona get fucked rest life üò∑ seen color suits wears? 15 bmi ass? That's cryptic message. Yes article says ""Most"" Nice! That's super sustainable rate weight loss! Keep training apocalypse! Subconsciously Donald knows pandemic response going well go well near future. Attacking Fauci narcissistic defense mechanism. narcissist cannot accept personal failure, must externalize failure projecting onto others circumstances outside personal control. BREAKING NEWS; corona saves lives!!!?!?! know pretty smart ones. also know pretty dumb ones. Remember, half people average. would think education training experience nurses doctors would least knowledgeable enough avoid contact vaccine because, know, blood clots, pneumonia, death? 

My always says shocked everything am. get this. like, know, common sense thing? live NYC people relatively slim compared rest country. One time, aunt Asian (for cultural context, Asian people comment weight casually) lives Denmark came visit NYC. walking around city saw overweight woman said ""wow person large"". big uncommonly big. looked twice alone. imagine aunt's shock visited South/Midwest. perception obesity actually looks like completely skewed. Hoping Dollar General jumps board next. They're everywhere. That‚Äôs stats loving people show. saying low death rate record high deaths back back weeks good argument good Florida handling things. Thanks! Governor DeathSentence implemented strictest measures prevent deaths, preventing COVID-19 deaths reported. ""So wasted three month head start, spent next month fighting anything might help, spent month pretending death spike coming. DARE BLAME MAKE FEEL BAD IT""

Theres blood hands everyone minimized it. Chinese one? Afaik Chinese ones furthest along mean BMI hovers around 27 mostly eat like shit blood work done around 6 months ago nothing report.

This usually works hit 40 machinery breaks rapidly workplace opened re-closed would receiving benefits existing claim. 

There definitely backlog. personally, weeks initial claim first check, I'm Oregon. I'm betting horrible states like Florida millions open claims paid all, purposely designed unemployment system function. know, hate here!!! hate lumped rest rn world needs ban US get shit together don‚Äôt know yet. could needed annually, every years, (probably maybe) once, probably vary depending vaccine get. far vaccine candidates clinical trials producing strong antibody responses good (Oxford) ‚Äòokay‚Äô (Moderna) cellular responses; likely variation length protection vaccine vaccine. gonna wait see none actually used yet. this. recorded outbreaks businesses, especially gyms. no, it‚Äôs safer.

Real poggers moment think cells longer term immunity read true failed country. cannot blaim people believing news they‚Äôre reading watching telling them. Trump encouraging idea wearing mask

You blame both. Trump blame downplaying it, dipshits like guy blame listening him. sympathy fuck. Kentucky. I'm 78% certain pass. trying say cases deaths reported territories? aren‚Äôt real? aren‚Äôt real people? double counted Israel‚Äôs numbers? really idea implying. Right. We‚Äôre finding severe thought. 

Even asymptotic showing signs dementia organ damage months later. thing inhibits red blood cells efficiently carrying oxygen throughout body, sends lungs overdrive causes clotting general organ failure. simply respiratory disease. vaccines aim reach everyone world, regardless GDP Weird downvotes. I've seeing odd trend downvoting anything remotely perceived negative based processes historical vaccine approvals. weird. Arizona empty desert. people actually live fairly dense. Yeah, lot people say political pandering. 

Let ask though, likely know I, judge involved (Boone County- Rick Brueggemann) made issued temporary restraining order Beshear's executive order daycare could open early. Beshear sent KY Court Appeals Judge Glenn Acree denied appeal sent line three judge panel rule on... meanwhile, means STATEWIDE day cares, summer camps licensed child-care operations must allow group sizes 28, nearly three times 10-child group limit Beshear previously imposed. 

Scott County also restraining order. seems judges problems mind usurping. power executive orders limited whether considered constitutional state's constitution? ground GOP using chanting campaign reverse protocols. Foreign investors don‚Äôt though. statement seems definitive that. 

If two years ""much longer"", would strongly suggest natural immunity much shorter that. vaccine candidates use, including highly scalable ones like BioNTech Imperial College (which aims reach ‚Äúall billions people around world‚Äù) Yeah way late finally... anyone got full list locations requiring them? Also requiring giving options door allowing saying medical condition excuse? really hate people would even that.
Also places stating anywhere added security someone walking around inside ensure policy still followed beyond entry? call lurking communicating, per se Thanks.

It also could people unknown immune issues. one girl Italy mildly sick like 75 days produce antibodies cured antibodies somebody else. plenty large scale protests especially around 2016-2017. Funny dont know due country.

Youre fucking delusional. We're trying dont get decide standard be. Public Health England says median 5 playing political game fools rather actually governing right. Thank posting interesting article. another quote. bolded important Responding images mask-less crowds patronizing recent business re-openings, U.S. Health Secretary Azar said, ‚ÄúThat's part freedom America.‚Äù encapsulates main argument mask requirements, something akin infringement individual liberties. Notably, similar arguments expressed regarding smoking workplaces. Individual liberties taken lightly, course, **such liberties extend imposition risk others.** shit Sherlock landmine?

Put Desantis jail. Fuck him. republican mindset. Please tell joking. Oh, never mind.... live Central Florida, sadly, know dead serious.  ^((pardon godawful pun)) also wonder blindsided primary focus initial cases coming west coast, meanwhile lawyer doctor (I can‚Äôt remember) traveling Italy believed patient 0 NYC Without hospital care, girl would died. hospital capacity fully saturated, CFR goes SARS level.  saying people go jail white collar non-violent offenses? Selling meth middle schooler drug related non-violent, still destroys life. Fauci President know impact asymptotic carriers back March incase amnesia. task force could data time brand new strain. Hindsight 2020 We‚Äôve reached point otherwise rational family members friends sending insane shit, despite knowing forcefully go them. Yes, people wear masks, businesses won‚Äôt shut again. mother 59 died (not due COVID-19, 3 1/2 years ago now). was, last months life illness got great, active member society. Traveled, worked full time successful career, vibrant, well loved, would help anyone time needed...despite living many years cancer (including two years metastatic disease) always gave others. miss everyday, yes, still far young go. still alive today people would write 50+ already cancer anyway. callousness amazes me. like late feb trying convince people covid already spreading states, feels like convince people deaths going spike again. Worst part CDC longer handling data could become invisible pandemic unless personally know someone it‚Äôs ‚Äúout sight mind‚Äù mentality. Eventually certain point though, don‚Äôt think anyone ignore longer. Maybe point around October universities entire classes coming sick. Target Chili NY already does, months. disrespect Stacy Abrams, wet farted Styrofoam cup, would also handled crisis better Kemp. completely agree I‚Äôm also mom teacher. spring looked forward fall. Now, sucks. Wear mask! didn‚Äôt die COVID stop hysterical flew Chicago weeks ago barely around anyone wore mask like 10 people flight I‚Äôm guessing mean Trump rather Beshear, think Beshear godsend. Think could place! agree, I‚Äôve always impressed JCPS, thankful sensible careful returning school process.  saying irs prioritized stimulus disbursement race?  Reaching pretty far think nonsensical. many lives believe saved due seat belts stopping bodies-as-deadly-projectiles? certainly know data I'm pretty confident number people killed unrestrained flying bodies *rather* low.

Life filled risk we, individually collectively, decide want step try mitigate risk. big part balance high risk takes stop it. Texting driving? Seems problematic, laws passed, PSAs made. distracted driving by, say, [an unrestrained animal seem collectively enough problem mandate dog restraints. Motorcycle accidents certainly produce bodies-as-projectiles banned them.

So again, good example since seems masks far, far greater protective benefit others pandemic seat belts drivers. One dumb, dumb selfish.  Yup. needed national mandate. One baby batter factory better, revoke breeding privileges feel bad friends south border.     
You seem much chance normalcy anytime soon.  
Crazy many fronts. majority dominated minority. hope make Nov.3rd pull thru. big truck, case round mask wearin liberals. stores area requiring masks since April.

Because see *very* different numbers. rate, county's growth seems slowing that's good hear! Bullshit. That's science is. Science need trusted faith placed in. Science, fact, demands opposite trust.

The pandemic exacerbated people ""trust science"", exacerbated bourgeois social relations place profit health, value private property people. Correct. wife make amount. paid first since gets money back right acc. don‚Äôt therefore waited like month later. (I‚Äôm 1099, case one asks) Congrats winning stupid prize That‚Äòs point.

Locking people voting never work. Even countries measures implemented, took authoritarian government draconian enforcement make happen. Doesn‚Äôt matter. knowingly lied.

Not saying rely possibility course.  remember difficult thing COVID novel.  getting little less novel time.  time develop defenses (natural otherwise), treatments, etc., closer getting past it. Good know everyone sub perpetually negative sometimes think British leftists jealous don‚Äôt Trump complain about

Personally think American 'leftists' bored Trump said anything while. see British person realise already taking virus seriously because, ya know, live here.

Disclaimer: British leftist sincerely doubt pan out. I'm alone here.

Pro tip: whenever someone gives time line research, always expect months delay, flat doubling hold PhD field. I'll shocked enough infections groups reach statistical significance October. December seems like much reasonable time frame expect results. Also note, manufacturing already begun. We're waiting infections naturally occur. could sped ethically dubious route purposefully infecting people.) I'm really curious see research duration detectable antibodies post-infection. 99% convinced Covid first week March (had tell-tale symptoms including loss taste/smell, followed worst cough fever life, month shortness breath, get tested still 0 confirmed cases MI travel history, later found symptoms passed exposed co-worker died Covid another hospitalized), antibody test mid-June came back negative. There's way it, antibody test calibrated eliminate false negatives, evidently detectable antibodies. *generally* problem ""All bodies beautiful"" movement insofar says ""Don't HATE body"". complications baby ended scars body hated hated body groups legitimately helped improve mentality.

BUT always looking see improve can. physical mentally. problematic people say ""Why improve, I'm already perfect.""

You read either died today, death reported today. believe meant former, false, really know that.  person lives Arizona, want apart experiment. People still think fake. made mention loans, wonder responding to.

Remember, saying ""churches"", includes churches, black churches. Christian churches. main line religions, ones widely considered‚Äã cults.

You're changing topics one originally discussed. I'm happy engage new topic, really make thread. Oxford Moderna two greatest hopes getting mess Sweden linchpin propaganda everyone pushing ""correct"" coronavirus response.

Even though still idea choice right one, everyone wants either copy copy - US time, worst worlds. seems obvious US cannot copy Sweden's strategy, might good propaganda articles say ""Sweden warning us"". also quite questionable since anyone looking closely arguments find fail. Others within US use Sweden example good ignore virus, even flawed argument. nature propaganda. not.

However, point entertaining question impossible enforce. waste resources brain cells. Except immunity short-lived, months best. Uncontrolled spread catastrophic. doesn‚Äôt seem like backtrack... seems like two totally unrelated tweets... ADHANOM GHEBREYESUS: basics aren‚Äôt followed, one way pandemic going go: It‚Äôs going get worse worse suppressed - main reddit sub coronavirus. gyms near CT even require masks :| Didn‚Äôt someone tell guy wearing mask doesn‚Äôt mean gun?!!

a good overview article: cells? let's test scare mongering. thought read article DeSantis called 1500 state nurses help even enough? seems like lot work effort fuck trump. Especially whole world ""playing "" along Doesn‚Äôt make okay. History long track record looking fondly governments lie people ‚Äúfor greater good.‚Äù research time made exceedingly obvious masks work, knew years. wasn‚Äôt ignorant, lie. caught COVID, tested time (pointless disease progression. 

The virus gone syatem week. late develop pneumonia couple weeks later. Although doesn‚Äôt, therefore, mean died COVID-19 related complications, simply tested positive it.

If covid, die, I'm pretty sure probably died covid related complications.  Oh agree 100% see happening. Even get lucky full court shot viable vaccine large scale production years end still faced idiots refuse get it. heckin' stupid.

Fine take business license away. Dr medical voice, need look everything? everyone right thing acted considerately responsibly, would tneed laws need enforce laws.

Unfortunately large percentage people seem think socially responsible adult apply them. That's people ""forced, put it, comply. 

Laws change time different world. Generally set enforce society's collective views part world. Given overwhelming good masks current circumstances versus minor personal inconvenience wearing one, seems entirely reasonable society set expectation worn needed, law reflect that. 

It follows follow rules face full consequences law, otherwise there's point laws att all. means you‚Äôre funny. It‚Äôs article posted it. You‚Äôre overly sensitive. ""You see virus ground there!""

People like putting 's store names belong. They're going provide masks people without them, presume store needs time get masks, mention training staff handle angry people potential disease spreaders Great quote...that‚Äôs failure federal government. everyone felt relatively secure financially would receptive understanding situation. Weird thing is, Trump said supports masks crowded areas before. kinda glossed it, said. see continue justify it. claim speed reporting ""streamline"" it. organization who's purpose control diseases. center kind? anyway know different hospitals‚Äô mortality rates protocols used? end needing go hospital, I‚Äôd rather go somewhere 5% admitted died rather 50%. I‚Äôm also interested knowing up-to-date research various hospitals protocols. anyway get information like this? narrative really it‚Äôs rare, impossible Fictional? spend much time sub yet havent seen research studies done around world. Maybe open eyes bit wider. 2020, nobody gonna hire people talk like Nick Cannon.

Not everything wrong world rich people. really sad. part least. dont know else do. miss much. Brexit so...dumb. love idea borderless Europe possibilities. I'm sorry part experiment nice outcome. worst case come continent, cookies Honestly could've predicted this? hard know. Holy shit...  No, I‚Äôm good. Maybe use reliable news sources then. It‚Äôs like ‚Äúdemocracy now‚Äù publishing things mentioned countless mainstream articles reputable sources. I'm wondering amount covid-19 droplets inhaled effect severity virus? wear mask fucking pharmacy, place vulnerable people need go prescriptions basic medical supplies, piece shit place society. That's true ! Even worse indigenous side. problems. think interconnected. I'm proud part problem. I'm working that. feel compelled SHOUT problem is. really interesting care much saving face they're willing die agonizing death it. admit covid19 real. right, Democratic Speaker House connection whatsoever Democratic Minority Leader Senate. They're two completely separate parties. Pelosi absolutely way bring pressure leverage bear Schumer. could possibly thinking?

I suggest *you* learn government works. particularly use thereof manipulate public opinion. Republicans embrace full bore; Democrats consider beneath dignity silently masturbating self-righteousness. heard Fauci Antifa. /S July! Respect workers forced work unsafe conditions, definitely. owners managers forcing folks work unsafe conditions go fuck themselves. 

Agriculture processing plant workers several facilities Yakima eastern WA cities needed go strike order get facilities provide masks/shields measly $1/hr hazard pay risking lives lives families. additional demands workers asking daily intensive cleaning equipment, staggered shifts, greater distance workers companies refused implement. Maybe drink instead inject. It‚Äôll cure faster. Total bull shit. video CSPAN.

You see ping ponging thoughts. Can't stay topic long aside wants go on, usually whatever previously said applies great is. government force wear clothes public? Surely it'd comfortable walk around naked somedays. body, restrict display it?   Yes even less normal winter. I'm sure ski resorts even open, example People numbers that's why. Male body images body fat Lol ok.

I see LOL means article also contains outdated information.

The article published July 15, 2020. ""my"" article.

It news article Exactly. without containment, peak limited population size - assuming people can't get reinfected. That's heard-immunity model, 75-90 percent population gets infected. However, 1% fatality rate, US would looking 2 million deaths. AFAIK there's reason believe fatality rates much lower 1%, certainly factor 10.

A lockdown reduces infection rate growth rate (for every contaminated person, less one person gets infected). infection rate goes immediately - however observed peak daily new infections delayed incubation time (people already infected discover several weeks later). One estimate peak based assumption current growth rate, effectiveness lockdown measures. robber

Shows maturity intelligence level person made sign. Anecdotally, I‚Äôve heard number bank employees nearby gotten COVID. It‚Äôs surprising work one giant room, put air conditioning full blast, constantly work public. literally season 4 Americans. corporate tipping point hit. put things perspective... tests per million inhabitants (source Worldometers):

* 50,000 European countries, two (Albania Ukraine) 20,000 several (Italy, Spain, UK, Belgium, Ireland, Portugal, Denmark) 100,000
* 135,000 US, nearly 90,000 Canada
* 50,000 Chile, Peru, Venezuela; 20,000 Colombia, Brazil, Uruguay

In Africa:

* 52,000 Djibouti
* 38,000 South Africa
* 25,000 Morocco
* 23,000 Gabon
* 21,000 Botswana
* 10,000 15,000 Eswatini, Rwanda, Ghana Equatorial Guinea, less 10,000 elsewhere. Including 1,318/million Egypt (2nd country number deaths), 965/million Nigeria (4th country number deaths, Algeria 2nd), staggering 9/million Sudan (5th country number deaths). 

In short: South Africa one countries continent actually trying keep track virus, that's many confirmed cases deaths compared everyone else. mean listen first place, situation Yet somehow human-made chemicals okay nature-made chemicals problem redditors insisting impossible weeks! remember US 30k cases day horrified. months later 70k cases day I‚Äôm even horrified I‚Äôm disappointed. 


The fact going back 1,000 deaths day months later disgusting estimated infected 500 million people.... look bad come 6 months later lol. Terrible upper management call. think understand full lockdown is.

Look Europe, China, countries curb spread. USA barely even understood let alone attempted 'lock down'

In France, Spain, others needed note leave house leaving, essential reasons only, fined. 


In fact, definition, Los Angeles ""lockdown"" actually closer fully open true definition lockdown. vote refuse play ""the lesser 2 evils"" - well, got full blown evil. *any* doubt Hillary President would better pandemic? Fauci President state/country live in? Stressing hospitals? closing hospitals. FULL. People ER hallways days. Right now. Texas. hope wake call WH needs. physically see it. People dying COVID hospital system collapsing. US. It‚Äôs deaths. many. western PA example several online charter schools like PA cyber AGORA. probably online charter schools area. would need contact school district dept education list. poster said use national cyber school. Check wikipedia's entry list accredited online schools state country (wikipedia...List virtual schools). Hope helps! need pill way. is... interesting. re-certify basic life support training yesterday. instructor refused wear mask, citing ""chronic lung problems,"" NICU nurse also taking class insisted pulling mask order talk across room. Fortunately wearing N95 glasses felt fairly safe, holy fuck hopeless situation even health PROFESSIONALS know properly use PPE flat refuse so. Democracy good source. uses highly emotive language noticeable left bias. 

We need critical sources, regardless political leanings. Even agree original source. 

In general, know source bias, try find got information originally. Typically, sources take article mainstream source spin favor. r/humblebrag Same. ‚ÄúShut fuck up, I‚Äôm smarty pants lifetime speciality‚Äù wish like zombies Legend, group together dark leave everyone fuck alone. true plague country. God damn brainless homunculi. Another argument favor self-checkout instead angry drones whining masks. machines complain exposed pathogens. peasants replaced robots fault claiming treated level dignity making uppity. compare number 911, weird people say big deal, many die US better job. harsh college graduate school work done online, grade school work. Well won‚Äôt even know trump admin hiding numbers us Gah I‚Äôm obese category right now, lost 9lbs month half I‚Äôm furloughed (hairstylist). hope keep momentum going. Anti-maskers running options! love see it. Same. USA #1 relevant subreddit? sucks leave enforcement low paid workers already sacrificing health safety essential workers. Bizarre one way put  Holy shit that‚Äôs disgusting.

I keto years ago used heavy cream things like coffee hard stomache. can‚Äôt imagine drinking straight cereal.

I use whole milk now. u've got big portion society think restaurants safe 

Then they're probably wearing masks getting together weekends 

Paying chance getting covid basically dead giveaway want send message subreddit sent me? Would value you? want try post something Democracy see automatically rejected? 

The point - ""list"" subreddit considers ""low quality."" sub published names web sites list.

Would like check subreddit ask them?

How help? vaccine, permanent. Masks social distancing slow spread. Even vaccine, unlikely eradicated. Yes, pandemic anywhere pandemic everywhere @Cuomo Trump August:

‚ÄúOur numbers much better now. Ever since took back control Corrupt Deceased Control, really drained swamp good.‚Äù

Trump Labour day:

‚ÄúChinese Virus low? would imagined, 100K cases July, 20K, much better, much better, Little Johnny little cough go school get educated. Teachers thanking me, parents thanking me. much winning.‚Äù 

*camera pans black woman ‚Äúteachers Trump T-Shirt* wonder badly memorial service 2/24 spread infections. obliquely, nonexistence Palestine.  data tracking sites still.

The data real. adult room. problem already it. see effectiveness need people vaccine get coronavirus. think they're funny out-of-touch?

Emphasizing 5G network aspect anything related COVID-19, especially COVID-19 testing public health?

They might well leave unlocked cans gasoline scattered around tower sites. Yeah worries, got meant, tbh I'm glad posted I'm sick misinformation. people know either centre left apolitical, suggestion also based anecdotal evidence.

I added disclaimer sort pushing attitude away British leftists Americans, wanted clarify biases. complete lack focus preparing

When Americans ever cared a) education b) future? Pew pew ... pew pew... pew pew...

The major factor read article still dont know enough happen months road. Scientists best figure charting new roads.

Well... time keep wearing mask, stay home much can, hope enough people slow give scientists time figure enough. point, I'm sure understand ""Agree disagree"" means. time-travelling Russkies, stealing ~~top-secret military research~~ open-source vaccine data going back time invent vaccine 5 days earlier! ‚ÄúNah babe don‚Äôt need condom, covid.‚Äù right first time... is... depressing. celebrities Republican side hardly. Hollywood controlled democrats push Republican entertainers. Tell mask political statement, iq test. go business. I'd say keep messages focused. Bringing things like media reporting Russia investigation nothing help argument could (and should) another way representing data. Trying sow distrust media like #1 way slippery sloping argument ""all numbers fake! pandemic!"" sound like that's direction meaning go.

My defense way media currently reporting death reports needs little revision. Going date death necessarily requires updating past data erodes public trust significant lag period published data near complete. Fuckin people, South Park supposed ""how to"" guide sources? Unfortunately, yes. [Here informative 

Even reporters call around hospitals, hospitals would allowed provide data. even possible break rules, couldn‚Äôt spotty. hospitals would conspire administration provide metadata CDC using formulate patterns strategize treatment. It‚Äôs matter data interesting, it‚Äôs CDC compiling interpreting data formulating meaningful strategies predictive trends.

Further, reporter would want ‚Äòbreak story,‚Äô would render data completely useless serious repercussions hospitals violation mandate. USA! USA! US.....eh? According John Cornyn, medical expert listen confusing debatable. many cases need people ill, recovering reinfected take seriously? ballpark number. I‚Äôm critiquing you, want know. important question recovered patients seem think immune reason. Even experts early talking antibody tests sort passport. idea taken hold. Babies gain object permanence around 4-7 months old... it‚Äôs sad think people don‚Äôt age past developmental maturity baby. simpleton little medical background, I'm sure expect believe timeline accurate one proposed researchers themselves, presumably close contact statisticians? A) appalling Amazon since April.

B) people infected yet exhibiting symptoms get thru anyway. Hence, masks, distancing, etc. Automod let guess Data politicized WH numbers reported longer reflective reality. Keep coping, everyone outside sh*thole western neoliberal-led bloc countries seems taking rather seriously. 30 million doses scheduled produced remainder 2020. Atleast paying long take find long virus doesnt live surface?

To proper scientific study multiple trials, evidence properly reviewed? normal circumstances, youtube getting removed saying lockdowns werent justified science, got removed.

Ahh yes YouTube doctors. think 140,000 deaths justifies lockdown. Seems worked countries. know sound like anti-vaxer pretty clear understanding epidemiology beyond YouTube facebook.

 90% cimetologists say global warming caused humans, they've flipped flopped decades research, first cooling, warming, ""changing"", probably believe either. 70 year old adhd mother talks. time done speaking 7 stories become mash up, 1 story half told forgotten. also aware ""insert something relatively boring interesting her"" caught eye middle story number 2,4,&amp;5.

My grandmother dementia hope adhd excited tell us stories shes happen week.  I've read mean lose immunity... least it. T-cell relationship important too. can't help feel like even 50% population gets vaccinated immunity lasts 3 months, 3 months large scale immunity make virus significantly easier control? issue even producing more, tbh. Stuff like Tenent getting pushed back Nolan wants release American theatres. Like dude, release cinemas can, release VOD elsewhere donate portion profit theatres regions. 

But yeah, people pretty creative drive cinemas like, point gotta get back business. kind herd immunity achieved vaccine. Herd immunity real infection give millions deaths lots people getting long term health issues. Yesterday got revised 1001. History judge actions. follow eating low carb would help

In annecdotal observation friends/family tried that, low carb fast path short term weight loss, quickly lead cardiovascular trouble blood chemistry trouble.  need planning physician getting regular blood labs going try something like that. lockdown last time work people still went socialized got groceries shopped etc. need lock people houses 3 weeks. one goes out. open back way. fine that. it. would mean martial law  Dollar Tree place, half employees even wear masks, let alone customers. I‚Äòll taking European vaccine. don‚Äòt trust Russia, China Trump admin. lie whenever suits them. doesn‚Äòt build trust. anatomy. Everyone's got one other. anyways, mask even something simple cloth face covering shown decrease transmission least 40%. one (or least be) advocating use masks 100% time, go out. literally least avoid another economic shut down. understand uncomfortable people claustrophobic, affect blood oxygen levels no, breathing toxins in. uncomfortableness that's bothering you, conservatives always tell liberals ""suck snowflake feelings matter"" ;) ever mention US? Sure same, among worst world. US sucks mean Sweden also. sticky somewhere tell list stores enforcing mask policies? that‚Äôs valid. wasn‚Äôt intention bring DSA guns thread. want point there‚Äôs inherent issue seems taboo country, even thread. Healthcare shouldn‚Äôt political/partisan/profit issue, unfortunately we‚Äôre creating fatal mistake. first confirmation US government agency 2020 going give lucky citizens concurrent earthquake, F5 tornado, COVID-19. i‚Äôm bit north you, took 6 days.  It‚Äôs pathetic people look reality television help determine live. study came last week said bandanas inferior masks comes protecting others chin gap. could wear gaiter something similar would Bless you, damage Sterling, we're going affording cookies time soon :-( Also, raise COLA year.

I used work hospital got out. think worked 6 7 years get single raise. COLAs barely kept pace inflation-a lot times didn't. asked raise, tried asking transfer another department higher pay. got denied fucking bounced.

And blessing disguise. Apparently department super hard employees (well, COVID-related furloughs) turnover rate high. Oh no! many angry Karens! Driving car privilege. Walking public place right. dont need license walk public whatever. least yet, willing bet sub ran country would required.

I 100% fine business requires patrons wear masks. person disagrees dont shop business loses money, decide make policy decided worth it.

I fine Governers Mayors legislating office.

If state legislature passes law gets courts obviously respect law abiding citizen. Stop overdramatic divisive, saying people killed this.


More people die enforcing mandatory masks, someone snowflake going kill someone required wear mask, society better jail. news story alone would probably help unite country anti-maskers...God can't believe anti-maskers thing... essentially saying completely lose immunity

I seen single article like that. Antibodies immunity. Testing positive second time mean lost immunity. I'm saying one there. saying ""completely lose immunity"" hack News like shows progress towards less virulent disease

They even _claim_ this! Let alone present evidince. Seriously, reading article? claimed ""coping better"" -- pulled right article. üò£

WTF?! Nipple deep crazy talk today. many mofos still Twitter. Pardon language. pissed off. Well, let morons please without consequences country. That‚Äôs condition country. Lol naaah Trump want whole country burn, much obvious. Trump care whether *certain parts* do. problem.

The thing is, mind enemy particular group US citizens enemy all. even question party politician enemy citizens, one least hostile whole. worked guy wrote code Visual Studio's. one new me. incorrect. assuming incorrect malicious intent. need provide evidence claim soundly rejected rational person Yeah. know what? it. Good job, kids. noble effort ignored liar-in-chief lemming followers. Still worth doing, know president care many people die nefarious reasons. lot folks gained lock downs, understandable was/is super stressful scary time. kudos reversing gains; time like present continue trend best self! Wow! quick üôÑ Yes. flatly stating wearing cloth mask significantly halt transmission virus. genuinely scary. Costco headquarters allow non store employees work home companies Seattle area started so. idea show solidarity people working stores. corporate employees paid poor decision lives. Costco got onboard serious COVID. Trump. hangs Putin‚Äôs every word. Fair enough - think timing. 

It might time, though, local movie buffs step save theaters, create things they've dreamed long time... ASAP!! Provided without COVID-19 getting way, course. Which... that's whole rub, it? :/ vast majority people catch Covid fine .

You really know ones does. one knows long term effects be. fine. Good thing President busy breaking law plugging Goya beans Texas ordering ice morgues. He's definitely stretched needs days break golf course. growing number people wanting Wolf impeached. think hes done decent job, least administration tried. perfect? better people decided idiots. sick hearing people call 'tyrant' asked wear mask. Like people genuinely oppressed, wearing mask make oppressed. definitely. overlook two places go supermarket gym(mask required times gym) seems like norm forget it‚Äôs something still debated Gross. want cry stigma someone points obvious. Nah, sounds like trying make case ""he loudest wins"". people nerve tell I'm underweight. Surely troll. Anyone even iota self-awareness able type without realizing shitty person are. company streamline inventory delivery processes, utterly evil, incompetency. Wtf. I'm convinced Trump intending virus bad call zoom y-axis harder? can't believe posted straight face. that's big scary spike, I'm feeling fine. worst aspect pandemic elected officials waiting things get worse infection rises exponentially. Corporations look governments set regulations like this. finally gave up. hope situation gets better Florida soon. I‚Äôm cool waiting Oxfords. I'm ADHD read twice. Thats hacked western world vaccine research.....riiiiiight I‚Äôve similar experience past honestly BMI perfect measurement ALL. may give idea people bodies vastly different health harder see simple equation. Russia can, put blame solely ridiculous. Mine used say, ""A wise person learns others' mistakes. smart person learns own. foolish person never learns."" episode iconic. ""DOUBLE CREAAAAAM"" Wait... saying fauci know brand new disease nobody else knew either?

Dis know Albert Einstein wrong approximately half time? even threw away idea another scientist nobel prize.

Almost like unlikely anyone would ever 100% right especially face brand new information nobody knows yet.

What exactly expectation? point many things Trump said since running president turned bullshit?

Ding ding ding heres fucking alarm, cant meet expectations human either would absolutely report people whatever administrative board can. Yeah went first available anyone wanted it. expect setup/rollout covid vaccine comes Really? took 'expert' point out? get signal. listen recordings him, television interviews like, younger man, lucid, articulate...what hell happened? screams cognitive impairment kind, likely form dementia. mention probably high chance permanent long term health effects got sick begin with. Gonna really rough road ahead her. Yeah, hard optimistic pessimistic right now. enough information me, keeping eye committing best practices. What's ""nope"" post? Everything said correct. 

Yes, caseload, ICU, etc. declining. Likely part Sweden unofficial lockdown form summer holiday: schools huge portion country vacation right now. Summer hol bit staggered going while. Many left big cities summer cottages holidays abroad. 

When think it, bit like accidental lockdown. GOOD since bringing cases gives SE time build TTI infrastructure discussing building. man.. POTUS want attention Finally good side effect. Could 100 people died 100 beds Somebody forget grab full dose consideration least. government removing deaths statistics people making test-swaps wearing masks, guess see became little hard people take situation serious along way. know correct. sucks. Actually need psychopath order take inhumane decisions way usa right now. Underrated comment Well Europeans probably much lesser problem point. natural dont want hang around sub talking issue dont have. soon numbers get like care far less issue go spend time another sub too. I'd rather talking NFL football coronavirus, virus mostly taken that.   Trump FLA 2016 around 113,000 votes. 

Covid kill around 50,000 Floridians election, elderly. 

If happened President cares re-election pandemic, smart move keep base alive till November. , there's large group conspiracists believe Bill gates China got together make virus, activated 5g, really kill you, want vaccinate you, implant microchips you, track killing microchip, eat pineal gland , child sacrifice pedophilia thrown good measure... think group responds simple answers Yeah 2 weeks bit premature Overusing/misusing literal/literally, geez  cost gets passed along store customers course (eventually via price goods). disagree colleagues believe could done better due statement hindsight 2020. F**k punching bag understand end game strategy here. 

Elderly people might vote republican candidates risk, reducing base

People inclined vote republican possibly going lose family members, may decide vote another candidate cross party lines, reducing base

The next Georgian election cycle going chaulk full campaign ads call Kemp callous, uncaring willing let citizens die, helping push undecided voters away him

I understand end game strategy here. imagine something able ban mixed potential negative consequences criticizing activity.

If doctor scientist speaking based science, would *potential negative consequences criticizing activity*? 

This mentality problem. Get politics science. science is. doctors scientists somehow self-censoring issue, else hiding rest us? like protesters aware risks either situation somehow they're safer infection large gathering legally protected.

The re-opening many places took place protests occurred. became difficult justify strict lockdowns requirements, outside dining closing public spaces, using containment covid reason, ok hundreds people protesting. coward's deliberately short-sighted lie. reason matters certain president reposted woolery's conspiracy theory, woolery post delete accounts soon n95 mask fit properly effective. already Miami yesterday 4 hospitals diversion status. It‚Äôs bad don‚Äôt report . run certain types machines oxygen support including bipap high flow order try prevent people intubated. It‚Äôs scary sight don‚Äôt think present accurate news anyone Sebastian Joes Twin Cities represent would disagree, knowing I‚Äôd expect worst , immeadiatly shut incoming travel China , immeadiatly implement wearing masks social distancing , judge severity virus, it‚Äôs better plan accordingly hurricane , hope downgrades tropical storm .

Though, there's small chance getting change minds, there's little doubt.

Yeah, retail managers can't even imagine worth tip, careful giving tips guys.

I know fair, change laws, dont break rules. Slow speech slow thought. Louisville.  try associate rest state. Exactly well thing is, yeah, probably contracted walmart, facemask protect getting COVID, protects others contracting it. That's everyone wearing mask said EU invented take advantage US. Prez realized that. others probably thought two horrible world wars 20th century divided Europe went others throats kind shit stop ... books excellent That's great question. plague actually struck recent times (Asia specifically suffered bad outbreak 1850s 1960s), never deadly 14th century. 

Now, course, treating plague hard. caused bacterium (yersinia pestis) thus treated antibiotics. course, would hard plague spread modern world, yersinia pestis living host population rodents carried via flea humans. That's likely scenario people would exposed developed world. 

So high death rate middle ages certainly compounded factors mentioned. Healthcare pretty much non-existent, hygiene awful, general population's health poor. 

An interesting note earlier decades 14th century, globe experiencing episode climate change hit Europe particularly hard, leading floods crop failures event known Great Famine. infants children born raised famine adults 1348, speculated health might permanently negatively impacted Famine, making vulnerable face Plague. might explain deaths elevated, least Europe. either way, Europe elsewhere, poor nutrition, filthy living conditions, lack dependable useful healthcare allowed Plague spread quickly widely well kill enormous number people.

I still don‚Äôt understand America‚Äôs issue masks Ok, could work.

I pictured someone able call sick total 30 work days. insinusting Covid racist England too. sure places risk locations countries. /s Right. don‚Äôt think understand what‚Äôs going US all. current leaders aren‚Äôt open taking feedback countries. average Americans, actually little done. ""And now, word sponsor, NRA...'"" Minor blip. 12 days since 4th July. Numbers going skyrocket pretty soon reason stores like Walmart already implemented new requirement masks know sheeple MAGA folks

*people support ignorant morons like Gov Stitt, well spreading contracted virus shopping maskless (""like boss?"") last saturday Walmart*

need plenty time convinced absolute douchebags staff door tell rights mostly minimum wage staff shoppers sickened exceeds right ignorant Fox News Republican MAGA super-spreader. needs support, he‚Äôs trying save lives, get re-elected mean, standards, yaknow Serious question. held breath 70 seconds low would oxygen levels drop? kid first grade. grows lawyer, get rich litigating COVID-19. guys know walking cluster fuck?

Who stays home fight begins

And let others fight cause

He careful; because

Who share fight

He'll share defeat. telling example initially called GRID, [Gay Related Immune took convince people disease impacted gay people.

It's kinda like young healthy people thinking corona can't hurt mostly kills old sick people. really hard convince lot people there's serious risk young healthy people too. might death, still well life changing. bullshit. 

It bothers leadership thinks dumb people can't handle truth lie us. 

I care reason chose lie American public. fact is, leadership allowed lie us whatever reason, might well China. what's point?

You keep saying US dumb, ""dumb people"" reason Fauci lied us PPE. reality dumb person. Fauci thinks dumb person well. me, NEED lied to. want people charge like that. shocking turn events sides generated rabid extreme views. ignore science push narratives (looking ‚Äúwear mask even you‚Äôre moving around outdoors‚Äù people). 

I‚Äôve stopped engaging people COVID. aren‚Äôt able discuss rationally. ah ok read wrong.  much lesser criticism simply BLM demonstration?

I imagine something able ban mixed potential negative consequences criticizing activity. armed protesters around capital lately trying ""liberate"" state lockdown, politician could try rail beaches large crowd gatherings what's potential gain vs risk situation? like protesters aware risks either situation somehow they're safer infection large gathering legally protected. Don‚Äôt bother wasting time GoT. objective seems good laudable pandemic raging shortage PPE probably best idea.  ""I KNEW IT!!'  Utah's Denna Robertson follow children school stay fellow classmates. money it. ""I'm Joe Biden forgot message"" that's precisely problem; enough science research matter. still lot learn thinks hes everything expert fires anyone disagrees him.

""Nobody knows stuff better Canute king England, Denmark Norway. Difference trying show didn‚Äôt powers, Trump probably believes does. least control tide similar controls weather, nukes [So looking far past Use critical thinking. happened last time Florida rising infections told huge death surge coming? hardly testing. doubt large % positives weren‚Äôt even back question. answer death surge never came. thing yeah, don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs going death surge. Especially since median age infections dropped 30s.


Over past week, many days Florida reported death count would top 10 deaths given day? word literally taken meaning word figuratively last 5 years? gave cancer read it. still idea said. That's like electrician sign stamp child's tests lol. I‚Äôm renting AirBnb lake state (NH) next weekend, that‚Äôs extent vacation summer. amazing think ""death lags"" explains UK 40k deaths. anything death numbers show UK's case numbers can't accurate. hope also reported Edited Title :) 
(And yes know Google Translate error, still completely wrong) claimed beneath 10% good idea size epidemic minimize untracked infections. months ago guidelines might revised.

Florida would need almost twice many daily tests (without returning positive!) positivity rate fall beneath 10%. yeah, they're way mark currently. that's unavoidable dealing unchecked exponential growth. lol. ""If made lab cant dangerous!"" Reminder: reason COVID-19 classified SARS-CoV-2 considered close enough SARS-1 studies investigate aerosol surface properties example would compare extrapolate results : (this one directly calls successor SARS-1). also reason COVID-19 another common cold virus. weird throw proof Tcells leaning connections SARS-1. Stop insulting master mankind.  Trump trying steal title him, going happen. lmao best comment I've read sub yet. Aussie app total flop. Governments good tech projects general.  else stay open long masks enforced.

easier said done.

First stop, ""Fantasy land"" pick ""Dumbo"" ""Hall Presidents"". kind ride days might want hang tight next stop, y'all visit beautiful ""Haunted Mansion"" take ride 135,000+ ghosts! Yeah, one highest cases/deaths per capita still seeing triple digits daily compared post-lockdown countries see single/double digits.

That said, Sweden's strategy absolutely going work countries like US people refuse social distance wear masks crowded places indoors.  feel employees. cast members choice, unless want quit.  staying within social bubble, that's recommended behavior many counties. already happening area Holy fuck! brain hurts reading that. read twice, still know wtf trying say. healthcare workers heroes right now, especially 60+ high risk. Rest peace. people could stupid, that‚Äôd cool you‚Äôre basically saying whole Sweden lockdown? Leader country leader state.

If leader country didn‚Äôt make decision global pandemic national scale, it‚Äôs failure leadership.

If you‚Äôre football game defense playing zone defense, quarterback keeps calling passing plays, it‚Äôs coach change approach game win. blame quarterback losing. I‚Äôve always wondered that. people think it‚Äôs something harmless think manufactured lab. believe anything 5% goal.  believe means testing enough handle outbreaks able contact trace (if state government capable course) Northeast Hope. leave booty this. I'm sure one said ""you know lot stuff huh"" kiss him, much teacher might praise five year old knowing tie shoes keep sliding goalposts deleting comments get traction want.

I'm sure handler appreciate effort, comrade. Yeah, I'm quite sure downvoted.

I simply stated registered dietitians taught do, help people *make sustainable changes* order achieve *their goals*--not tell goals, tell eat, exercise, etc. type prescription sets people failure. undermine anything. Ends vs. means part story. comments section hopeless. going bend curve anytime soon. today DeSantis pushed video Twitter great job we're Yeah Dr. Fauci done solve Goya crisis? Dr. Fauci academic. sit around nothing. Trump man Action! makes history academics write it. Lives San Antonio. We're top 10 fattest nation. virus kind proud it. UK covid deaths 45,053

Florida covid deaths 4,520 Come Florida meet DeathSentance Pretty astonishing. you‚Äôre socially distancing outside little risk. scenario someone business coming feet within quietly.

What concerns people think mask don‚Äôt need social distance.

The outdoors circumstances pleasurable moments let guard (mostly). Again, I‚Äôm saying 7am can‚Äôt see anyone around me. GUITAR DUAL!! wrong translation? US definitely underreporting numbers. peak, state (NY) alone 800+ deaths/day around 10,000+ confirmed positive tests. we're saying America 7 times amount positive tests close amount deaths NY peak?

I absolutely buy it. Yes, deaths lagging indicator. But, there's way lagging much behind. There's lot number fudging going America's death count. won‚Äôt cooperate. People operate businesses homes go completely underground order make ends meet feed families even higher probable risk infection compared allowed stay open first place.

These lockdowns result economic disasters California states. It‚Äôs bad people think safety financial solvency mutually exclusive parallels. hilarious hard got downvoted. Since Ukraine ""Anglos""? Oh I'm sorry worried feelings we're damn PANDEMIC they're direct cause people dying. bullshit ""Obama's low unemployment numbers fake they're counting everyone"" rebel mentality america. people ANYTHING government does, recommends mandates. ""fuck want due freedom"" type thing It‚Äôs Sweden, Sweden!! üòÜ age problem, mask problem. reopening honesty problem. take statement face value. area know several places get test today- two different hospitals medical district drive through, local university drive low wait times update twitter, etc. Dallas county locations providing testing.

Those options addition BSW, giant health system, likely tests available staff working respiratory therapists. think daughter lying possible confusion miscommunication somewhere. would immune system get compromised reduced airflow beyond catching virus? compromised immune systems work. wake one day asthma wore mask reduced airflow. reduced lung function b/c asthma, happened air quality child genetics. However, new asthma diagnoses frequently linked catching covid. So, mask reduces spread covid (which many studies proving do), risk reduced airflow mitigated entirely that. I'm using asthma example, myriad diagnoses could swap still make point. Also, reduced airflow = / = reduced o2 increased co2 whatever argument want make here. happens prolonged illness, covid do, wore mask hour Kohl's. Link whatever study want here, I've seen one surgeons reduced o2 intake long surgery, never followed ""and immunocompromised"". 

The mask mandate would extend effective way treat cure coronavirus. take then, get hit harder, reduce chance spreading covid. people cannot wear mask reason linked medical condition, something like reduced motor function, introduced alternate (face shields, online ordering, curbside pickup, etc.). mom wears hearing aids, wearing ear mask makes hard wear aids. bought new mask go around ears. Kohl's job figure alternative going pick.  Fauci wants deal pandemic, someone wants deal messaging pandemic pandemic itself. meant lot countries, corona counted cause death virus die. hidden conspiracy, literally countries officially count coronavirus deaths. around different countries, I've got internet connection like one using read article. even said made assumption. that's they're counting Italy, okay. acting rude Yep, that‚Äôs biggest gripe - they‚Äôre effectively saying ‚ÄúHey, let us know SARS-CoV-2 system 2 weeks ago!‚Äù whole Covid19 thing classic ""federal government"" level stuff. crazy create national response plan. Ahh yes sun can't burn skin either. high sky! ""drink feelings away""=healthcare ? don‚Äôt know else sad it. We‚Äôre better this, people. USA 1400 yesterday, highest total since May us. yes, large spike time here. wasnt reply. essentially repeated wrote one small change: health vs. heatlh, dosnt address comment all. Back lost job mid April can't tell many people came workplace coughing hacking sneezing saying ""oh allergies im sick"" without tested. many mix denial selfishness wanting quarentine two weeks. Finally, good news. here!! harm, foul, friend :) Bullshit. comments supportive strategy. Strange someone says support it. 

I find another one posted ITT. pastries etc. Lots pics Swedes coming boat etc. Got know, demonstrates Hillary failed 2016. beat Trump, think ignore antics refocus things issues like Fauci; makes look like even idiot distraction tries keep attacking you. 

But try argue back him, like skinny dipping lake full flesh eating bacteria. struggle struggle he'll slowly eat alive endless what-aboutism jokes. reason can't argue troll memer. Time report HR. point, virus never going gone good. still haven‚Äôt eradicated polio measles we‚Äôve excellent vaccines decades. Big dumb ego

Edit: mistake, thought talking Trump Let clearer: I'm arguing Republicans compromised Russia. I'm saying fucking matter one way another. America always beholden corporate interests, Republican controlled current villain change that. tables..have turned :/ That's basically nearly private security instructed do. Starting fight large insurance risk. That's Trumpian leadership you: pass buck.

But yes, America lot incompetent asshole Governors state legislatures well.

Thanks, Republicans. one still wear correctly. went yesterday state mandates it, everyone either nose mask pulled way down. company give af cuz employees even abiding laws. Sure, bit Faucci never thought inject people disinfectant.

QED Orange-Peel went C21 store saw white woman shopping without mask. She‚Äôs walking around like nothing got mad came near said wanna give us blow already!?  Hey, that's local CBS station...running story end country... Thought whiskey dick. - younger people getting more
- much better treatments
- deaths delayed

If hospitals overwhelmed covid non covid deaths climb Russia 100% hiding information. way three times cases Italy, 1/3 many deaths, twice many cases Spain UK less 1/2 1/3 many deaths respectively. Russia claims fewer deaths New Jersey, despite recording 5 times cases. 

I dont even buy Russia's testing numbers, claim done per capita major country UK It‚Äôs even impressive physics. Angela Merkel doctorate quantum chemistry, field advanced don‚Äôt even begin understand reading Wikipedia article. Haha much simpler answer thinking. place send hate mail? crazy would work hard discredit good doctor political gain. epidemic winding not; also 1/3 per capita deaths NY NJ Maybe some. Took 2.5 months stop horribly painful cough thanks breathing exercises. top absolute exhaustion 2 weeks felt like broken ribs.

At month 4, 14 mile hike 4500 feet elevation gain. 5:45 3 hours faster last year, carrying 2x water.

At month 5, still don‚Äôt feel quite myself, good enough considering. Better 3 people know probably gave parents 4/6 hospital. #1 reason DeSantis won‚Äôt shut state.

Patrick Star Ron DeSantis (probably) held personally responsible outcome. Trump makes sense assume means harm. world laughing US years Fauci fucking hero odd thing - literally get someone killed wont around see go home hospital, meanwhile person infecting go merry way......Jesus.... Americans stupid stereotype. truth. keep proving over. problem long-term obesity long-term effects immune system, losing weight great overall health, losing 10 pounds month necessarily help COVID-19 No, they're not. vaccine readily available least early 2021. right might successful convincing idiot core good job killing twice many people could have. According tainted thousand years come Sweden. unemployed Bar Bouncers got new gig! 25 year old diabetics mildly obese unless there's causes diabetes.

There many different ""versions"" diabetes. conflate them.

The ""other causes"" literally different disease. like comparing gunshot knife wound. make bleed cause treatment two differ.

Use Type 2 preface talking Type 2. Swedish strategy like Vasa: quick sink, takes forever recover.

omfg ... die home? article makes sound like never went hospital died suddenly without ever intubated. work corona virus patients that‚Äôs generally goes. reports cause vascular damage perhaps stroke respiratory aspect disease, article talks symptoms of, doesn‚Äôt kill night seek treatment. think Queen give that. Derp derp derp Sounds like scolding 3 year old play politics continue literally save us. He's trying HARD. I'm glad us listening. take ferry CPH northern Jutland. Easy. Big Degree Energy!  made dumbest man earth governer? deal bullies. turn cheek. I‚Äôd love see behind door rants Fauci Merkel tho. admire take Trump grain salt able stay focused instead letting get distracted nay-sayers. belief (well, hypothesis) children huge transmission vector covid. Kawasaki's Disease immune response happen back number infections, rare (on order 1 1000). think quite likely covid-triggered disease seeing rare, reason seeing many cases simply many children infected covid.

In NY covid must running rampant schools lock down, disease started popping shortly after. covid like show symptoms kids, none wiser infections. children obviously concern, also easily bringing covid home families.

Japan handled pandemic well, that's large part general public's good sense. fact see plenty people complaining government done much all! one big thing pretty early close schools, think probably one first countries so. However, schools open month now, public still behaving caution months (almost everyone wearing masks, gasp!), know, japan's curve pointing upward direction. genuinely good subreddit go to? seems swedes also slightly better *voluntarily* follow recommendations CDC. 17,000 people responded 3 percent positive.  corresponding survey done Stockholm, 2.3 percent carried virus.

So, antibody-tests though, Stockholm carrying disease. think also said today press conference random sampling faulty since havent checked areas reported (as 35 % answering) works many countries, there's reason people wanting happen US well. also makes funny face drinking bone broth problem, hope find informative! Let know think! sun moves throughout day.

Reread it. enough power you! 

They looking 10,000 volunteers. Sign up! Don‚Äôt believe people tell you, it‚Äôs mostly false exaggerated. 2/3 reports American tourists, although, it‚Äôs mostly exaggerated sensationalised click bait fake outrage. 

That cluster Kerry group Dublin guys went staycation type thing. doubt it. Left-wingers hellbent hating opposing political party like right-wingers are. bet rotten orange encouraged mask use start, democrats left-wingers would praise least something right. American here, taking Moderna. trust much trust Covid data going DC instead CDC. completely unarmed society would best it‚Äôs feasible. agreed disarm, us (criminals) would lying would keep weapons. criminals armed, would deep doodoo. That‚Äôs arm too. Yes right everyone walking together. 1 country starts run see finish line (you know one), others also run try finish first. EU also tried get everyone work together buy PPE. work.  case would best news ever, death rate keeps going virus weaken. hope right. come? Well looks like it‚Äôs six people died that, alone without loved ones spending weeks months suffering hospital. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre sorry made numbers look bad. Doubtful state seen increase Tidewater area. 50% cases driven area.

In Northern Virginia current rate cases fallen exact range 150 cases last 6 weeks. even move Phase 3. yes, zero new information. Thanks long response!

I remember talking turned promotion either director NIH something bigger studied infectious diseases thoroughly opinion he‚Äòd useful there. much paying?  virus, see. politically motivated. recent days, Trump moved reroute hospital data CDC administration, criticism Fauci consistent broader attempt become scientific authority America. attempt likely desperate attempt, poll numbers plummet.  mean cartel part? Could explain that? Living Australia curious know Mexican cartels reacted covid. Sadly could see coming day 1. Well deaths lag 8 weeks testing getting put system. assuming 10x many people infected confirmed I'm sure based CDC saying evidence back up.

But want make assumptions use infection numbers 4-6 weeks ago death tolls today. cases spiking like mad, deaths caught up. going extremely deflate CFR/IFR. Walmart largest? come never heard Kroger? already has. mean third fall? Texan here: least we're Georgia. best trailers! best trailers world! didn‚Äôt even think needed many trailers got them, got fast, country trailers like ours. Hes interested political games played, knows cant fired Trumo really, plays straight says fuck politics, lets kill shit.

Which true. shame people outside political sphere agreeing listening continuing protest riot ignore guidance middle health crisis. best beans! woman specifically says going disobey recommendation thinks ""petty"". Swedes going lately Swedish strategy supporters celebrating going. need hire big ass bouncer motherfuckers kick ass catch without mask. I'm Japan. Masks help, work. make sense? Everyone's risk lower masks worn, spread slowed. But, bad outbreak bad epidemiological conditions overcome masks infect anyway.

Yes masks worn, deliberate distancing, lockdown, testing isolation program necessary. structure strategic lockdown.

There 10,000+ deaths per day US soon, end wartime conditions (rationing, martial law, New Deal legislation) imposed solve things.

All idiots wanted mess around. :( release vaccine already...Can't worse releasing early compared we're lack leadership.. used go bars guy named Dwight sick office. people unlucky. honestly defies sanity. Murica said, none stopping states reporting data. think pretty much every state COVID site that's run Department Health. states get first crack data, CDC collects there. certainly true cases deaths, believe hospitalizations too.

Conservative states already limit data. state changed way it‚Äôs reported multiple times. make case load appear smaller. Let fellow Karens COVID deniers set go fund her... oh wait, selfish bunch... Nothing Swedish either. right and/or wrong. Increased weight sugar intake increase likelihood type 2 diabetes. case sugar, that's still true normalising weight total calorie intake. I've seen Florida multiple testing facilities 100% infection rate. total disaster. Agreed. Although likely able relax posture moderate severe reduction reproductive rate. Fat contains little nutritional value, make feel full. It'd empty meal, seems fitting. dude, I'm dark minded cunt Internet, need take seriously. Look buddy Evidence? wouldnt surprised data shows people color, poverty (usually democrats) ones mostly getting sick Trump going let ravage electorate benefit come November. president heinous act possible. heroic. so. mean, governors know Karen doesn't? Nothing I'm sure protester way knowledgeable run country people elected majority. Jeez. governor's mansion open tours yet?? boat. internist admits multiple COVID positives day half people don‚Äôt wear mask even testing positive. wife plead saying 3 yr old kid one us gets it‚Äôs going bad. Georgia wishes bad Florida. Karen's USA? need data people different ethnicities affected medical differences ethnicities. It‚Äôs possible populations biologically susceptible COVID-19 others. Perhaps different animals like mice spread around, people notice breathing nearby. 

I know concerned mink farms locally government decided culling economic loss. mink farmers promised make sure mink escaping farms kinda leave mice please. 

Perhaps got infected eyes wearing masks. long keep going cases drop completely, guess best can. So... free vasectomy? telling every doctor, surgeon, nurse, hospice worker, firefighter ,Emt dentist etc.. wear masks fashion statement? far cloth masks go perfect? reduction spread rate doesn‚Äôt hurt anything. aren‚Äôt wearing masks protect ourselves. wearing masks protect neighbors,community friends/family . fucking patriot, make smallest god damn sacrifice one ever ask you. meek individual least stay inside. wearing mask hard maybe need evaluate life. over, jail governors refused mandate wearing masks. told raises well ER nurse real bummer hear. thinking largest supermarket chain? post would‚Äôve asked Kroger would‚Äôve said type food Yup. Yet followers constantly say Cuomo Murphy murderers cause sent sick people nursing homes. Average Standard Deviation important Maximum, predicting potential size future outbreaks companies need ban customers globally refusing wear mask. they, ""take business elsewhere"", else go.

Long ago read scientific paper said actually brain chemistry DNA controls whether type person responds one way another situations like this. Pretty sure crowded beaches Betsy DeVos‚Äôs answer every question. sucks year validating prior sentiments society devoid moral intellectual constancy quite time.

We seeing whats hidden underneath years now.  Provided CARES act, partnership local ISP hot spot companies This. communism finest. America, fucked. true. aren‚Äôt assholes, promise. there's many don't. media tell multiple studies HCQ pre-covid show MILLIONS doses deaths increase death associated HCQ all. Nice try though. I'm pretty well read drug. Conservative sources? Lol. Yeah WHO, FDA, scientific sources ""conservative sources"" sure. attempting make rational argument. people don‚Äôt operate logic, operate belief. People Reddit don‚Äôt like hear things disagree with. one biggest liberal subs there. protests argument joke aren‚Äôt anything beyond financial reasons. Wal-Mart particularly infamous giving zero fucks staff. purely benefit.  
If staff get sick can‚Äôt work trouble keeping store open. it‚Äôs keeping asset functioning, nothing else. wouldnt vaccine needed covid work lol. would treatment. vaccine supposed PREVENT ever affected it. Problem California accounts 1/6 US GDP production, good luck South, 1860 anymore. 

From military point view, coastal states form alliance, flyover states would crumble month due resource shortage. believe releaesed monday That's productive, I'm pretty sure that's gonna go extremely well. know walking dead gonna start profits. didn‚Äôt want turn customers away see writing wall don‚Äôt want go negative PR company lets customers infect other.

It‚Äôs image getting wallets door.

If smart would brand ‚ÄúWalmart: Safe Place Shop‚Äù really hammer ensure shelves/products disinfected. worry; feeling we'll zero cases zero deaths end month. At,least according White House. I‚Äôm curious means chain businesses like Walmart Kroger mandated masks stores nationwide. assume still enforce rules since private enterprise, it‚Äôll make much difficult explain Karens use excuse‚Äîthe governor isn‚Äôt even masks, listen teenage store clerk?? Thank you. 

\- exhausted mentally drained American I‚Äôve known nurses think basically bad flu. Stupid people exist every profession. nurses exposed COVID. However, overall I‚Äôve seen many healthcare workers nervous, scared even, like anyone else, following guidelines. Except many general population get work home, healthcare workers go work get told ‚Äúnot bad‚Äù, people refuse wear masks, deal PPE shortages, deal people avoiding public dressed scrubs, work directly confirmed potentially infected people procedures generate droplets. happens kids whose parents can't afford internet? coping bullshitting dancing around truths done, reality simply assert itself, humanity weep powerlessness. can‚Äôt numbers go places? Gotcha. Thanks extra context. I'm relieved virus take next week big stores take time mask requirement...

MARTIN-LUTHER-UNIVERSITY HALLE-WITTENBERG

   
Pharmacists Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU) succeeded detecting smallest amounts SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus using mass spectrometry. investigation, used solutions people COVID-19 gargled. future, new method could serve supplement tests previously common. improved available standard diagnostic tool. First results published journal ""Journal Proteome Research"".

To find sure whether someone acutely ill COVID-19, currently reliable test method: polymerase chain reaction, PCR short. detects virus genome therefore specific. tests, hand, usually recognize antibodies disease - however, body forms course infection, serve detect surviving advanced disease. antibody tests also often unspecific sometimes cannot distinguish various corona viruses occur humans. Test laboratories worldwide therefore reaching limits capacities.

Prof. Dr. Andrea Sinz, mass spectrometry expert Institute Pharmacy MLU, idea develop new mass spectrometry-based test complement PCR. Mass spectrometry allows precise identification molecules based mass charge. Sinz employees developed method search components SARS-CoV-2 viruses. ""We measure peptides come virus directly, genetic material,"" explains Sinz.

The Unimedicine Halle provided Gurgel solutions three COVID-19 patients trials. Sinz 'group developed method identify virus components highly diluted samples. ""Although received little garlic solution, able find components virus proteins,"" says Dr. Christian Ihling, carried tests. ""It quite surprising, expect really work myself,"" added Sinz. test highly specific virus, since corresponding proteins found SARS-CoV-2. also used test well initial phase disease many viruses mouth throat.

The test currently carried 15 minutes, says Sinz. working group trying shorten analysis times. currently uses artificially produced virus components this. Sinz also looking partnerships, including industry. ""With company Hesse, want use another mass spectrometric method would enable measurements carried within seconds,"" says pharmacist. method would comparable so-called ""biotyping"", already established clinics diagnosis bacterial fungal infections. However, still shown whether approach suitable detection SARS-CoV-2. sample preparation would complex measurements could also carried non-specialized personnel.

The new diagnostic method mass spectrometers yet immediately available. Sinz hopes ready action months: ""I close exchanges colleagues world, pandemic sometimes much worse here."" also founding member ""COVID-19 Mass Spectrometry Coalition"", research network wants use mass spectrometry better understand disease. perfect 6ft Americans weigh 221+ lbs ""obese"" body fat entirely true. ghislaine maxwell, mary trump, joe biden, others die next week terminal windmill cancer. dangerous. didn‚Äôt.

Murica fuck yeah ! never entire life heard name Kroger it‚Äôs biggest country raised in? What? saying that‚Äôs false but... why?   agree. Giving smaller states power relative number citizens makes sense. Otherwise risk undermining federacy allowing big states dictate rules upon smaller states. hard find right balance people always unhappy. undeniable value.

Socializing...during pandemic. big deal, happen even does, bad cold... don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs direct evidence, it‚Äôs certainly pretty good sign recall correctly there‚Äôs also viruses robust cell response prevent reinfection believe.

- Patrick Star UK's confirmed cases way off. look death rate proof. Going KOHL‚Äôs essential necessity. don‚Äôt need mask shop online either.

Very people medical reasons wear masks (ie lack motor function adjust mask necessary). respiratory compromised absolutely wearing mask - know people lung cancer COPD wear masks even pandemic public mitigate risks respiratory illness. Please tell wrong about. give sources Agreed, time shut now, weeks Businesses tired putting workers risk non mask mandated states want held accountable employees get sick antimaskers. Good them! Mass graves, like NY.

Yep. work hospital roommate urgent care. We‚Äôve call get tested week keep fingers crossed it‚Äôs stomach flu. Yeah probably right... :( peak TWD, characters demanded right get bitten infected, adamantly denied zombies existed even attacked zombies... I'd tell ridiculous. would insist way people would demand become infected deny zombie reaching face stood right front existed.

I would wrong. think part entertainment media. many movies shows nowadays ‚Äòtwists‚Äô truth seems there‚Äôs shady shit going behind presented facts.

What poor do?

Not buy tons soap hand sanitisers?

Not get foods healthy them?

Not get products help elderly family members safe comfortable?

Not attempt tighten leaky windows?

Not make backyard inviting children play children stuck home?

Not buy anything preparation potential shortages near future?

Not get freezer store food home rather go shopping every week?

Not stock towels?

I get it, *what* done? 

As Danish citizen *exact same* income throughout lockdown reopening.

But OH BOY **pandemic** expensive!  "" biased media one ""

so.....every major American media outlet words lol ACT founder Larry Kramer, called Fauci executed firing squad, eventually formed alliance Fauci contributed greatly advancing treatment trials early '90s. Fauci later praised Kramer, left Kramer choked up. developed surprising genuine bond. heard they‚Äôre opening parks offices remain closed anybody confirm? Indeed one first meetings president Russian envoy divulged classified intelligence Israel. allowed Russian state media US. first fucking red flag want remote. FCPS gave option. Instead APS caved based zero new information. school option; research EU shows option safe. Americans want destroy generation kids, though, guess that's choice. find appalling. Sounds like needed extra year school system.

Covid still recession. There's actually plan wealthier nations subsidise poorer ones. Quebec recoveries need 2 negative tests believe

It depends region. Montreal simply seem count recoveries, all.

Meanwhile, parts Quebec report normal recovery numbers. insane...its common sense.  lol, know nothing education child development, obviously never get tired working hard wrong? Hmm, measurements say merely overweight (25 &lt;= BMI &lt; 30) eating carrot makes obese (BMI 30), nothing between?

Technically correct though, I'm sure practical terms conditions called ""mildly"" ""heavily"" :). She‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs meemaw, yeah. Lee‚Äôs 100. last census Thailand 2010, meant another one year may delayed Covid.

I suspect 66.5 official census Thai citizen figure, citizens plus legal residents, would match think, 3.5m non citizens sounds right.

One NSO Census 2020 planning document found sets exclusions:

* Non-Thais live Thailand less three months prior census day
* Refugees illegal migrants live refugee camps 

Now that's actually LOT people, many people ""legally"" ""visa run"" least every three months visa class permits continuous stay longer that. live here, counted.

While migrants, see estimate ""3.9¬†million¬†documented undocumented migrant workers"" ""1.6¬†million¬†migrant workers registered"". mostly workers three much poorer bordering countries, Myanmar, Cambodia Laos. Workers countries almost manual construction jobs here, manual labour.

Additionally Thailand's National Statistics Office say census significant undercounting population.

So think matter sources, whether looking number people legally counted, estimate actual total population.

Most third party comparative sources like UN World Bank give number 69.5-70m scientist doctor making trade-offs American people (outside unique cases like triage)? Americans power anyone fields do. vote speak mind. pass laws regulations unless they're part Congress local state/county/city boards like citizens. They're opinions tend carry weight true literally expertise matter average person. make wrong. 

An accountant's opinion public health carry weight epidemiologist's epidemiologist's accountant's taxes. whole point society people specialize beyond hunting gathering people bring expertise matters single person could hope achieve everything. real irony one symptoms observed COVID-19 erect multiple hours, study shows virus cause infertility. Paradoxical much? That‚Äôs big problem arising then.. thanks heads Lux üôè I'm Walmart fan...at all...I actually avoid normally...but they've stringent enforcing covid rules masks area months. Better almost anywhere area surprisingly. Going far two separate mask checkpoints hand sanitizer get in. I've gone Fred Meyers lately simply that. shares of.. Oxford? university? That's point. vaccine research bright spot rest country fucking terrifying. Well telling people masks ineffective wearing political challenge president certainly helping. Ah, words actor. f*ck vested interest people wearing masks outside companies make Halloween costumes? stupidity mind blowing. Why?!! It‚Äôs big deal wear mask Fuck. hate people. Karen employees, send link. shows research done exactly i'm talking about. ""absurd"" all.

Here red flags critical thinker would catch cite

1) pre-print back March still published - words passed peer review

2) paper one author - something unheard medical research

3) author talking inhaling vapors cloth drenched alcoholic drinks even wild turkey enough kill virus surface needing least 90% alcohol - 180 proof son.

4) inhaling alcoholic vapor cause intoxication making authors claim *""This suitable clinical workers""* dubious really dumb fuck

5) inhaling alcoholic vapor According poison control.

6) investing alcohol supresses immune system making dumb fucking move sick.

All commonly known things make absurd suggest disinfectants used people. course you, like Donny know simple middle school biology absurd. that's ok cause rest get laugh claiming say Trump referring LIKE ARE. love put words people's mouths. Trump never used words bleach injecting bleach. 

Just bringing disinfectants body clean lungs saying ever happened, personally aware studies show possibility using vapor disinfectant lungs virus bacteria. 

Really? somehow unaware glaring stupidity paper Donny's incoherent possible media spins terrible terrible words form narrative. possible bias trump blinds narratives.

No.

Did miss look brix's ever talk fucking wife fucking lowlife cretin.

The guy trying defend Trump's bullshit calling tool. Dude, 2020. snake oil salesmen *identify* doctor tell aren't? ^^/s Thank you; really appreciated, sincerely. 

He‚Äôs echocardiogram morning (right now, fact). He‚Äôs got private room here, huge relief. People worst-hit areas, thought getting beds all, kind focused care loved one getting ... well, it‚Äôs devastating think them. allowed life?  would think would Target instead maybe Walmart ps4 controller wanting Fauci's reaction textbook way handling melodramatic liars. Imagine media learned it. Yup. Texan here. fact daily deaths reported infections likely occurred 6-8 weeks ago terrifying. means state‚Äôs super grand proud successful reopening end May barely joining death count. people grown ""complacent"" mean things exactly bad appear, means give enough shit something it...there's BIG difference  Florida, Florida, Florida. Kroger owns bunch Grocery Chains. Fred Meyers, Fry's (the Grocer), Dillons, Smith's, Roundy's, Ralphs, Food4Less, Harris Teeter, Mariano's, QFC, &amp; Ruler Foods Kroger umbrella. 

Kroger 2nd largest general retailer US, behind Walmart. Guy Obesity smaller think. 

Because roughly 1/3rd Americans Obese 1/3rd overweight BMI (by bodyfat percentage more), tend see person ""dad bod"" little ""thicc"" perfectly fine ""people walmart"" big.

The truth Dadbod obese. Thicc obese. Go look pictures 25% bodyfat percentage men 33% bodyfat women looks like. shocked ""small"" is. Fuck mean cant blame fall ‚Äúfake news‚Äù ‚Äúcovid doesent kill‚Äù 

If fellow member society helping disease spread pandemic people dying put family risk, definitely EVERY right blame even consider murderer - arent day 1 anymore, arent month one, saw effects people feel shouldnt blamed resetting work progress fucked starbucks haircuts. argument affects rights complete ass. NEED carry gun public places mask interferes arent carrying right bear arms, malcontent mind placed watchlist license revoked. good portion scientists said masks shown effect spread virus. data available show probably does.

That scientific consensus knowledge changes mean people lying before. Sorry couple paragraphs much reading Hopefully get year immunity normal infection vaccines. almost certain point immunity lasts 4 months given lack reinfections. Korea: .00056% happy I'm home. entirely dumb. case numbers Northern VA (and entire DMV) comparable numbers European schools went back. I'm sure retort blah, blah, Florida...blah, blah Texas.

If felt unsafe option children go distance learning. Instead small majority teachers parents forced parents (where 80% supported full hybrid learning) go views. instead, given bad APS botched spring, going punt entire year's education children.

You look back 2 months ago APS stated go Distance Learning completely ready...see July 13th. ""Umm...we need 2 weeks.""

Thankfully, private schools this. I'm sure mortality rate stay flat schools open. definitely bad bad seems. UK 3x population Florida. written like holy shit single state passed whole country! Florida big state UK small country. happens viruses, notably Dengue. It‚Äôs called ADE anybody dependent enhancement. Problem it‚Äôs rare researchers seemingly feel strongly happening meaningfully we‚Äôd seeing evidence it. likely people actually reinfected worse first time it‚Äôs produced weak immune response weak infection. Cut three months later breathe ton virus particles get sicker immune system isn‚Äôt ready. 

If guess, think probably infer enough immunity become seasonal. Hopefully won‚Äôt get vaccinated every year. Yeah pneumonia-related ""non-covid"" deaths massive amounts globe.

It interesting work total death toll would already guess passed 1M deaths worldwide based lot shady countries count cases. 

Even early days Iran digging mass graves claiming still double digit deaths. Wow mean actually Economist jobs there? gave looking got job banking seems like I'm one people economics degree still job He's unfortunately dealing man-child so...... fucked. pandemic hospital‚Äôs staff hit hard virus. date, 194 staff tested positive directed self-isolate. Many staff members since returned work.  
  Robertson Garry receiving calls hospital employees, patients sources reporting PPE shortages, mandatory double shifts, ban preventing employees non-COVID units wearing masks, visiting hours reduced canceled concerns procedure staff returning work quarantine. Excellent points. the, oh, well, 64 end productive life anyway! extra time called help department take COVID patients,‚Äù Tulip said.

RIP, Isabelle. Thank spending career helping others. sorry others let political points would rather deny reality face it. military budget incarcerations stop analysing sample older than, e.g.. 5 days, start newest samples. 

Try get ahead curve. Coke dick - inability get hard coke not?

There fines violating nudity laws. that's dressing law demands.

Hell, get sex offender list children see parts anatomy. happened men publicly urinated front children.  America become land magic. numbers reduced wave little hands childlike words lips look like chicken's behind. first!!!! Since required Phoenix, rarely see anyone without mask. I've seen plenty people start go without mask, turn around. People seem respecting mandate here. mad Florida lead. trying get caught up. people would normally hospitalized sent home oxygen tanks. know guy Tennessee still angry seat belts required. He‚Äôs also angry he‚Äôs allowed text drive. Claims it‚Äôs individual assess risk. talking wife many stores would follow Wal-Mart this. mean, even Wal-Mart going require masks (which exactly known cleanliness health), embarrassing still open without masks. Thank fucking goodness can't void actual businesses requiring face masks. Augusta, two weeks ago businesses ""strongly advised"" use facemasks, require upon entry see reversing especially Walmart normalizing requirement well. executive order requiring take covid19. order also prevented testing suspected residents prior admission readmission. order.

Literally nobody thinks wear mask getting mail......... suggested back Feb China ignored - least finally getting traction (even 5 months later) diabetes result obesity though? *Oh, got trouble!* Classy guy. Fauci president. could help case providing link statement. mean, can't write many deaths happened one area Chile. Plus, read comment, never said 9/11 worse COVID. would really depend aspects we're discussing, one illness brutal fucking war. terms intense affected, I'd probably rather deal COVID caught going there, personally. much move + citizenship going cost? Army want people think themselves, follow orders?

Are position command accept facts coronavirus obey you, legally free people must persuaded? Isn‚Äôt first thing alcoholic drug addict needs acknowledge fact problem want recover? stop denying fact? true, think Americans lot acknowledgements address.  US done for, combination Trump Covid much recover from.... Canadians go vacation US though without problem Closing nightclubs bars serve food biggest change. best! one prize, person living Florida, want win. read comments then... Disneyworld - theme park equivalent Florida Man. Armenia fully Asia. pretty much ""healthy size"" cope.  Boomers pointing fingers us, Gen Z pointing fingers boomers. circle life never ends. teased elementary, middle, high school big curvy. almost abnormal someone United States health issues. Unhealthiness normalized. Congratulations longer trust test data. act bad faith 

We need concern anti science people, bad faith pundits like Carlson, anti science leaders like Trump. agenda already made minds, anything move closer goals fine.

We need concern ignorant, people hear conflicting stiries know believe. easily manipulated confused, people need reach. hopefully prevent becoming manipulated bad faith liars. question much daycare (and schools, functionally similar) accelerate spread? 

Infected daycare centers spread families, older family members people dying. statistical sense, kids dying Covid.

The worst thing spread daycare workers frequently infected, seems inevitable, act hubs.  Statistically kids likely end orphans way around. much see valid underlying point. diabetics study. 

One leads pretty much. Unless getting obese eating 12-pound turkeys every day dinner probable cause obesity modern people going junk carbs. would take time even answer totally useless response

I trying communicate level proved Fauci lied response ""no didn't"".

You prove anything. I'm curious long expectation vaccine herd immunity. acceptable vaccine today, long would take mass produce, distribute globally (or least domestically) provide everyone? [Trumps large sums problem Love man. Integrity States? I'm looking leave continent lol. I'm working getting German citizenship soon vaccine available. Whoops, looks like misunderstood saying. fully support worse case plans üëå. matter what, I'm putting risk. I'm 28 year old working class American. Like could afford plane ticket UK? heartbreaking comedy here, too. Meanwhile president expects reach around BJ wearing mask once... could feed lot hungry people roasting MF social distancing (I'm assuming one meter (one meter three freedom units) distancing lines stuff) acceptable mask?
Even mask take particles out, enough contain shitstorm.. where's proof small particles can't travel two meters air? 

In short.. both? presumption fact. assert things facts clearly know not.

And like said, said might explain, thought evidence back up. clearly try present factual. Nuclear powerful and...they don‚Äôt understand yet...that women smarter streamline reporting? data reported extra work also send CDC? Can't just...cc email? not, much extra work duplicatively send CDC? ""The best people. best people..."" ""How come?!?!?!"" hardly shocking. They've playing game since start. anyone questions automatically far right nutjob. Countless examples government lying deceiving point. virus real everything much, lack better term, bullshit. Yeah can't force people take expiremental vaccines without understanding consent. fuck shutting down. Unfortunately I'm they've bought competition (which much better service quality) dragged level. see trucks trying deliver electronic equipment, material one many holes roof truck - rain. makes sad they've taken NE largely. course, idiots like ones say ""Eh deaths slowing down"".. ""deaths hgh Testing!"" 53% adults wearing masks still way low. Fauci like guys build bunkers build huge supplies ""inevitable apocalypse"".... apocalypse actually happens.

He's got world supporting White House can't anything it. MySpace told wrong. idea answer question, mostly inkling motivation. Literally I'm saying comment one responding likely accusing individual I'd responded divisive. would appreciate help could provide Thanks information! take don‚Äôt lot anti maskers Germany? 


It really shame leadership do. I‚Äôd say better success story Taiwan. Heck, less 500 cases thus far. South Korea 13 thousand, Singapore, way smaller, 47 thousand. Singapore‚Äôs credit, 27 deaths 47 thousand cases, versus South Korea‚Äôs 291, Hong Kong‚Äôs 10 Taiwan‚Äôs 7, respect guess consider success. got discussion lady Walmart (I know, bad idea) said seriousness. asked local nursing home burned (it happened many years ago) deaths marked fire victims ones cancer marked cancer, heart disease others, alzheimers others. said course fire victims. said, without fire die today (hypothetically) covid. already executive order place that, part it, forbid cities counties enacting measures strict ones put down. 

However, small increasing number cities counties declaring mask mandates, upset challenging authority. made new executive order explicitly state, again, mask mandates allowed. Thanks reminding that. ""uncle nuclear"" made LOL needed laugh start day. benefits administration nobody believes anything alternate source true information. even matter obvious, work. That's what's frustrating this. here, even outdoors allot people wear them. Crazy see much pushback places. Masks stop particles droplets - air. it. think Van stand firm though.  wish point movie could look back history.

I'm sure endless movies pandemic finally (whenever is). lot people probably feel PTSD watching too. Yeah dad lives middle nowhere Ohio he's consistently one masking apart employees drugstore. People bought ""plandemic"" conspiracy getting people killed. Mid-level managers follow instructions executive management, follow instructions political leadership. mishandled way top. Wait second, that's captain that's current president Brazil! Yeah, doesn‚Äôt require much. posted almost daily virus brand new, thought well known risk. redditors childless sociopaths last sane person admin pushed out. Supreme Stable Genius can't made look weak, he's got go. watch Congress jack-shit it. missed sarcasm earlier haha. think nursing homes bullshit too, I‚Äôm definitely looking plans parents. virus brilliant makes terrifying. one hand, strikes perfect balance many people kills versus contagiousness, hand, brilliant enough know Gov. Kevin Stitt dumbass also holds governmental authority people virus benefit then. Yes president Football Brian Kelly. know states live besides Ohio right? lot us would welcome open arms. might zero federal interest stop perfect ""super hero"" presents monetization:

""Only stop this!"" Millions people die, believing cries narcissistic lunatic magically gets hands vaccine cure he's hailed saving messiah everyone waiting Let's keep going, keep restaurants open almost full capacity.. That's one places people go purposely spread catch virus people ignore local mask mandate Kemp says count. someone gets fined wearing mask, appeal probably win. stupid people lived isolated bubble, I'd risking life limb regarding taking poorly advised Florida vacation.

But isolated, get home, rest us encounter grocery store get unneeded exposure. 

*That's* issue. Communicable disease personal risk factor, communal one. Preventative medicine profitable all, work hard keep alive invest nothing keep healthy . Reasonable response: ‚ÄúHey in-laws, much would love see often, incredibly risky behavior disregard safe practices recommended experts precludes us seeing you. see, daughter pregnant would like ensure healthy possible child arrives. best ensure around puts us risk. would love able celebrate joy soon experience welcome new member family world show us respect health politely decline in-person interaction.‚Äù Lol. imagine degree.

Yeah, problem, I‚Äôm tired revisionist history didn‚Äôt recommend June people keep spouting. Okay, well, fact reducing complicated framework false dichotomy ""working"" ""not working"" tells need know opinion. know must different brand lot people, time really managed get act together get shape, hated body. speaking physician friends, kind get impression real reason visits often mentioned doctor leaving room ""but doctor... one thing..."". mean say heard immunity possible. would take 10x 20x amount infections. That's realistic. 

But statement people lose immunity again, agree with. sad news kekistan I'm Bay Area, part, everyone see wearing mask they're around people. Even roommate, pretty right wing (believes Obama born Kenya, Bill Gates planning track us vaccine, etc.) wearing mask every time he's around people public. However, there's public park mile half adult men playing 4v4 small court, guys sitting sideline next game. pisses off, want play! played rec league every damn week four years Covid guys getting enjoy something able since March. really ""tyranny"" police would waded crowd swinging billy clubs splitting skulls.

But also think test vote. happens time Walmart. 

It‚Äôs absolutely insane. mortality matter much hospitalization rate effect healthcare systems. 10-15% infected thought need hospitalization...
Even small percent die, that's still devastating amount resources required keep people alive. modern society, matter strong, handle massive run hospitals. ""easy,. still bare minimum deserves positive recognition compliments. yup, probably bullshit

as far tell people genuinely can't wear mask (or failing that, shield) people physically can't put (or keep) mask shield Sweden's COVID mortality rate is, fact, greater 100x worse New Zealand, Slovakia, Singapore, Australia, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, etc everyone else? Ok I‚Äòve read article don‚Äôt to:

They changed way counting don‚Äôt include around 3.5k 21k (16%) ‚Äùprobable‚Äú cases, positive test, _but_ two three markers (antibodies, symptoms, contact infected) ‚Äì book means they‚Äôre sure hell infected.  said doctors silenced government want make conclusion. Yet defend making conclusion virus cant transmit readily. part scientific literature tell make claims evidence? 

All talk based information currently available, yet refused share vital information regarding virus people shared it. guess refusal share knowledge part scientific training? Rhetorical question. say US deserve praise response. Get head ass actually read. 

Somehow mind, alerting doctors treating novel virus equivalent public panic? ~~Critical~~ thinking clearly strong suit.

De Santis would say right face..... live? wanna move there. Recommended whom? talking covid, post-covid, what? Personally, used take baby aspirin since heart disease, started taking supplements anti-platelet activity, stopped taking it. Interestingly, two liver enzymes dropped high normal low normal. 

Many doctors recommending baby aspirin patients covid-19 play safe. Stop blaming everyone else. Take responsibility lousy leadership! It‚Äôs bad decision bad decision since whole thing started. Parent teacher Isn‚Äôt science tells us go school first place? LOL bulldoze trees build things south. I...couldn't even begin imagine logic would make sense. like reddit's system.

Before pass judgement mayor, I'd like read nursing homes did, do, prevent spread virus within buildings. Firstly, really see downside. What's downside? Kids getting sick upside. Teachers getting sick - upside. Parents/Grandparents/etc getting sick - upside. Fewer people general - upside. Parents take care children - neutral.

But, let's assume sake argument agree you. Keeping kids home still - very, far - best option, even good option. And, really, option unless we've really decided risking lives kids, teachers parents good plan - see lot state governments school districts have...

I glad Canada done well, people like mom worry tremendously. think. I'm saying fund UBI solely 10% cut military budget. I'm saying cutting 10% could help fund social safety net.

Also 350 million adults US, number would lower. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm seeing too. Labor trades acting like it‚Äôs big deal, also ‚Äútheir rights infringed upon‚Äù. working wearing mask make sure don‚Äôt get sick. feel like yelling can‚Äôt technically legally right. Morally? much.

Humanity get humans continue behave way yup saw sad thing is, eventually effect personally. Hey get new positive cases drop somehow. Thats great, mask usage help prevent number climbing higher needlessly, thank part. Stardew farm THRIVING!  said lot people go back work. government isn‚Äôt gonna pay people stay home. aren‚Äôt. anymore.

Maybe year exceptions doubt since student equals less $ schools. they‚Äôll extra hungry year sure.

I sending mine going back education job don‚Äôt deem safe. recognize route everyone gets take. husband made considerable sacrifice last 20 years ensure kids always come first income extra.

But even feasible everyone. 

I think it‚Äôs complete bullshit teachers staff schools entirety social safety nets right now. 

Kids can‚Äôt left home alone parents work. school become daycare time, it‚Äôs unreasonable people think school since one predicted government failed us actively made things worse us.

But it‚Äôs is. kids teachers sacrifices made name $. country! So, assuming smart enough wear mask, masks work, right? like Polio level virus... going pay bills get food myself, wife, children forced stay home 3 weeks? sarcasm. Seriously. wealth needed stay home till shit control would happily stay home. don't. [Why leave really? placing blame teachers school administrators? 

Really? Downvote incorrect use word ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù. least know decision polled among undecided voters. bad Asthma never problem wearing mask mask ance sound likes thing 8 year old would make get school. science obviously side reopening schools.... stand way... Wtf point, exactly? ""I got staph wearing mask!""

Ugh... think Safe Unsafe ""purely"" matters judgement. classify things dangerous safe without personal judgment.


Looking barrel loaded shotgun someone finger trigger unsafe regardless personal judgement. football happens year sad embarrassing. Sad people become sick others become sick die. Embarrassing stop march towards Super Bowl champ*. Pennsylvania 1000 cases day, announced restrictions. 1st mask mandate.

Now: 
All indoor dining: Reduced 25% capacity
Bars: Open sit-down meals tables only, bar service prohibited
Telework: Mandated (if possible)Gatherings: &lt; 25 people indoor, &lt; 250 outdoor

People kind freaking here. Grass isnt always greener. Enforcing masks \_is\_ keeping people safe.  

If fine mask violation greater fine speeding, rural counties actually profit. Fauci. like wish people listened you.

But also fucking boss propagating pandemic.

The young people know really serve older people local ‚Äúon border‚Äù ‚Äúchilis‚Äù people born 100 years ago they‚Äôd chanting ‚ÄúMake Polio Great Again.‚Äù think make state specific, still step right direction people LOVE stock market! Whelp, homeschooling is. one sub are. They're extremes opposite ends. People mostly ignoring significance people constantly inflating significance here. reality somewhere closer middle closer side. People act like virus 90% fatality rate way often..... tgis thing? lived Florida honestly might trying leave now. Nah, people post sorts bullshit sensationalist articles, many times unproven/obscure studies articles twisted fit narrative, long headline negative it'll get upvoted thousands people bother reading headline. loses, resigned immediately. danger world. spikes, yes, either bellow, least officially. Personally, worst gone, think premature. That's I'm saying all. 100%. going take short amount time altered #s called - especially hospital utilization - seems big piece wanted hide. Well science side must done sort risk-benefit analysis. many dead disabled kids acceptable number? even read article dink! say article true. goal prioritize first-time tests people know it, reduce retesting people several weeks later see still (on assumption person isnt shedding like 3 weeks out, seems like safe assumption). 

So impact number new cases discovered. anything, may allow states test new people quickly. limited tests, definitely prioritizing new cases. Gotta faith, he's saying? Ok, obviously talking fat people here.

I've sides around BMI scale. There's definitely huge swath fat obese Americans basically allergic exercise healthy eating. know Bakersfield then. want antibodies wow. Puts new spin term ‚ÄúCold War‚Äù Texas here. I've coworkers send emails asking anyone knows anyone who's ever gotten covid19. guess nonstop videos news around world enough proof him. NOO BROOO THATS COMMUNISM NOOO PLS BR NOOO DONTWANT WAEAR MASK NOOO BRO PLS resident United States receive **free COVID-19 test** conclusion lockdown, test negative, return normal life. test positive, stay home admitted hospital receive free care test negative. 

What world makes us think test 330 million people? able test even close every day pandemic combined. Here's difference. in-person school means kid might get sub-par education. In-person school means teacher MIGHT DIE. make clearer? Yes, god bless America. Best covid response world. USA #1. Oh that's convenient. Typical honestly. likely they're lying. better bring 2 yard sticks. took entire $720 billion military budget divided among American adults, person would get little $3,000. That's remotely enough money fund UBI. live Virginia lot people think masks dumb.

Yes, god bless America. Best covid response world. USA #1.  outshining Trump. general Soviet army getting popular, Stalin dishonoured killed one way other.


Also, want sell beans. I'm Georgia right behind guys freeway doom seems. stay safe hope blows love. That's fine. store make accomodations. often mean, order online give employee list wait car. move police funding Public health hire officers laid enforce it. don‚Äôt care shitheads sue. courts throw suits, hopefully order pay states legal fees. 

Getting universal masking likely difference millions lives.

It would like implementing airport security 9/11 fear lawsuits, except masking much effective save thousand times lives. posted another topic. can‚Äôt imagine difficulties faced single parent families. Even families spouses working going childcare difficulties fall/winter, don‚Äôt already. High earners hire nannies, otherwise, good luck.

Well that‚Äôs good news. completely misleading, White House still taking **new** reports rather CDC.

Out curiosity, source that? really anecdotal experience. Facism war truth. hoping come home work today see employer list. Maybe tomorrow. get email grocery store chain (not Kroger stores another name) said they're going require masks stores.

My state requires masks anyway, since May 1, allowed say anything customers wearing them. lawsuit? would think governor would sort alternate stick could beat one mayors with. would someone go get tested 4 times testing positive first time? Snip! Snap! Snip! Snap! great response! It‚Äôs ok am, dual income kids Obesity also astronomically higher chance taking decades life vs virus.

Put money mouth is. put mouth Corona is. Texas Corona parties* yeeeeeehaw!!! Fake not, nearly bad shape long. many foreign journalists hide truth happening ground. Strict lockdowns work.

Maybe Trump actually something help situation would trust fudging numbers. recommend locking hotspots like China did, still even believe virus real. problem whole economic paradigm. wrong parents work 5 days per week get by. wrong school much necessity, education, pure simple childcare. 19 year old kid much easily replaceable MBA corporate position. stock name Oxford buy?

How swedish something like that?

Disgusting... death number surprising low considering case count around 10K. know \[ locals \] going food without walmart, now. Gov. DeathSentence. like Newsom dad called Gov. Nuisance last phone call.

Now can't stop thinking either name. Might be. don‚Äôt know extent. among kids. Personally I‚Äôm leaning towards Sweden case. free lean way. government enforce unconstitutional law? Parent here. sending kids get covid school bring home. no. uninitiated, ""prn"" means needed someone good weight usually digestive underlying condition.

or self control. It‚Äôs targeted concession, enough former covid-deniers starting turn masks, prevent overwhelming outcry, businesses following other‚Äôs lead ‚Äúrequiring‚Äù once. They‚Äôre keeping possible concessions back pocket undermine future outcry, like limiting number people stores, free delivery, etc. gov also trying beat back mask mandating, fReEdUmB, requirements masks place, people may consolidate around requirements...like monthly stipend quarantine, free testing, government-funded distance learning schoolkids, decent unemployment benefit...or basically anything would address current crisis. 

It‚Äôs like negotiating buying house - never agree lower number unless really to. states requirement stores? news live Midwest. stores' rule, governors'? Saaaaaaame. I‚Äôve thought migraines last days assumed because, well... everything, maybe go tested. bad grassroots campaign going double every 6 hours! morning 200 signatures  also make decisions ""available data"" logic science conclusive. isnt much situation assume maybe flares up, maybe get infected again, stay home, wear massive eye breathing protection never get aroubd groups people. Keep health, vit c ,d sun, regiments believe may helpful.

There many things cause concern, accepted/admitted. Masks, aerosol spread (now considered likely), eyes infection point, older people risk, ventilators work best, long term health effects known, kids immune, kids dont spread it, doesnt mutute much (oops mutated transmissable), more. wrote spoke concerns early on, watched optimistic people say dont worry, evidence either way. 

I keep open mind possibilities I'm tired optimistic statements saying dont know, dont worry evidence yet. still nurses telling airborne wont open windows closed air environment.

This virus shown - assume worst safe. state observstions logical concerns ""proven"" Im sorry proven right early concerns. shouldn‚Äôt lockdown start don‚Äôt stop virus slow restrictions lifted Okay, well, apparently can't discussion comment removed political. Meanwhile, White House made statement today ""The science stand way this"" regarding reopening schools. 

A lot people going die... Get ready half million dollar hospital bill enforce it? mean ?

‚ÄúThe authors computed risk exposure low (1 10,000 exposed people) medium (1 1,000 exposed people), 7 days monitoring would sufficient identify symptomatic cases.

It's basically 2/3 states already shut March-May need now. 1/3 states paid attention right thing deserve punished now. thinks ""Snitch Hotline"", believes people going violate rules. means, NBA Bubble going work people going get infected. even one person goes bubble, bubble work. picture clearly isn‚Äôt satellite ‚Äúorbit‚Äù.

BTW, reports Hong Kong virus mutated already, possibly making vaccine ineffective.

Honestly, think realistic solution EVERYONE wear masks foreseeable future achieve kind herd immunity...if possible.

But Governors like one Georgia mandating masks despite rising cases state, think going hard row hoe.

Yeah, business want put place anything stop people coming in, that's loss sales.

Instead literally asking businesses job kicking people call police trespassing. Many businesses bother. Florida always one-ups time muh freedums ridiculous hit piece part internal US politics. Sweden used weird strawman sides. US right going ""Sweden anything, they're fine!!!!!"" (They're wrong), US left going ""We need lock down, otherwise we'll many dead Sweden!!!!"" (They're also wrong).

This piece says nothing factual Sweden. Looking death curve Sweden, tail end it, completely absurd watch thing, full errors exaggerations. even got great little boo-hoo anecdote story someone's father needlessly died it. Sad, yes, shit happens time *every* disease. unique covid-19!

Anyway, think piece ""news"" Sweden, completely wrong. manufactured American audience push acceptance lockdowns, shame states currently experiencing surge. ignorance suffering source joy.

In sidebar says ""Please civil empathetic"" - clearly lost you.

When everyone become hateful!? school reopening.

Oooops, didn‚Äôt work. blame now? sounds like intelligent plan. 


Where MD though? Crap, hoping get rid obese cruise obsessed neighbors sooner reason Im saying said public trust undermined kind justification people wearing masks.

There freely available evidence masks work people still choose ignore it. ignore it, they'll say lost faith Fauci, hilarious anyone anti mask point purely political reasons, doubt Faucis opinion ever meant anything first place. types even believe science.

Non maskers get pass me,they get ""well fairness..."". Either wear mask willfully ignorant. Caligula try make horse member senate something similar? think makes much sense Trumps appointees. problem stores (or states) make mandate, creates perverse incentive stores/states require profit morons. That's coordination leadership important (and US utterly failed). like government sometimes incompetent private industries forced pick slack  Six, really. February well known coming. feel like fine place eight years ago. 2016 really ruined everything.  stores enforce it. know Whole Foods enforced gate. People without masks simply allowed inside store employees making sure customers wore masks. muh freedumz! blame media covering story. really hard put blame gov't officials - can't everything. Nobody talk thinks stabilized. one (in personal group friends, family acquaintances) idea hell De'Santis acting like this. primary theory going run president next election one.

SARS-CoV-2 part family ‚Äúcommon colds‚Äù. ~25% common colds corona viruses. never generated vaccine common cold dangerous enough spend billions develop one. believe good chance get vaccine virus. issues time take many people die mean time. fools realized, eventually, everyone within couple degrees separation someone died this, gonna 'get real' everyone, maybe direct family, neighbors uncle (thats 'death' know of). We'll surely know someone first name basis well.


it can't hoax neighbor dies it, realize masks fucking stupid. Hey ‚ÄúAmerican individualism!‚Äù

If dont wear mask, dont teach kids. Freedom!!!! Tick tick tick tock - state Georgia (excluding Atlanta) - you‚Äôre next. Atlanta‚Äôs Mayor smart resourceful. would hold send school. going weeks shut schools anyway, suddenly full-remote slots available.

Anyone thinks sending kids school right good idea needs head examined.  I‚Äôm glad live state mandated 4 months ago stores. even weren‚Äôt special level dumb walk CVS know sick people get meds wear mask. Distance learning effective younger kids. also effective kids parents completely un-concerned un-involved. ‚ÄúThe science stand way‚Äú perfectly sums Republican stance pretty much every single current issue facing us today. GBF Japan (a country) 623 new cases

Oklahoma (a state) 628 new cases

Minnesota (my state) 605 new cases

Japan even numbers ticking still really good job. Comparison wise mean.

Edit: clarify would prefer testing though. could lot more. aren‚Äôt EVERYTHING prevent common usually avoidable causes death? decided get loud taser instead case I'm situation like this. general idea let know stay fuck away threaten become violent also sounds terrifying, easily stay 6 feet away lol. problem pepper spray person (and you) going start coughing everything going make people cough/rub eyes everyone store spreading viral particles EVERYWHERE, technically need perform extremely deep clean surface contamination otherwise becomes hot spot next week. food within 3 aisles needs discarded, sad true. buy loud fucking taser, one strap try pull still get jolted literally said feel like democrats b st thing ever disingenuous fuck.

Australia, coronavirus test could cost little free much free ouch.... ‚ÄúInformation stand way ignorance‚Äù. could,

It could also mean huge spike infected long enough die yet. first huge wave area near 0% fatality rate till exponential growth tapers deaths chance catch up.

By way still think deaths rise again? recall sad. real reason feds want masked listening people talk either podcast NPR something. saying distance learning really works older students adults kids discipline focus. Also, kids need extra resources classroom provides. bring bunch kids classroom, kids going wash hands, they're going wear mask properly entire time they're going cesspools germs normally take right back home get parents sick. choice dead bag inside refrigerated truck putting mask! wonder makes easier people make right choice. make way incoming adult tantrums DeWine: We're track become virus hotspot.

Wow! saying mild asymptomatic 20% cases? That's pretty bad. sure got upvotes. ü§î Paywall really naive think Canada made luck. talking business owners saw shutdown coming beginning March. reacted quickly shut fast.

 ""We need vaccine. Nobody needs it.""

Everyone else I‚Äôve seen test ends 97-99% range. sure something non Covid related worried would loose wear mask? ADA: 

 person disability able wear face mask, state local government agencies private businesses must consider **reasonable modifications** face mask policy person disability participate in, benefit from, programs offered goods services provided. reasonable modification means changing policies, practices, procedures, needed, provide goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, accommodations individual disability 

### Examples reasonable modifications face mask policy

* Allow person wear scarf, loose face covering, full face shield instead face mask;
* Allow customers order online curbside pick-up contact delivery timely manner;
* Allow customers order phone curb-side pick-up contact delivery timely manner;
* Allow person wait car appointment enter building called texted; or
* Offer appointments telephone video calls.

Kroger offers curbside pickup delivery. There‚Äôs absolutely logic said. every good politician does, pass buck make decisions whatever happens fault. Counties cities issuing mask mandates. one could easily argue burden proof mitigate spread dangerous conspiracies. knucklehead. long phase 3 trials take? read online take 1-4 years I‚Äôm assuming speed due situation right now. Can‚Äôt find articles studies medical sources indicate wearing mask poses risk health anyone, CDC says someone child 2, trouble breathing, unconscious, incapacitated unable remove mask without assistance shouldn‚Äôt wear mask could potentially cause issues, studies point false like others said, reasonable accommodations curbside pickup would likely acceptable honestly, someone major health issues preventing wearing mask use option prevent contracting type illness going store.

As ADA requirement, article [The National Law explains businesses likely would face ADA violation case refusing service even person claims disability. run 5k 2-3 times per week mask on. times decreased since I've started wearing it. Actually, I've personal best time mask on.  fair enough, seen empty shelves know mean. sending spy shortly picking up? lot restocking happens early evening less interruptions customers could see _some_ due timing -- guess rule lazy pickers entirely :) Wait already to? wear mask germany since like 3 months lol people complaining able breathe masks going run anytime soon. Take leave absence then. they‚Äôre saving lives do.   It‚Äôs muzzle! certain one else got sick Covid19? gotten anti-body test? well could flu reaction, but....

I listening Science Vs interview Dr. Fauci today one thing struck (and importantly him) particular virus massive range symptoms impact. none way quick death respiratory heart failure worse long lasting serious symptoms last months could cause serious long term damage body. know little learn something new every day. isnt alternative then. Kids going school daycare. Almost everyone students. Even shutdowns. deepest sympathies. person independent disease sucks can't life everyone else.

The hardest thing I've ever found giving permission sick, even felt like one else was. finally got there, helped. Cause it‚Äôs gonna go away, it‚Äôs gonna disappear, like miracle. Everyone knows that. worries numbers, going better ever. Way muchly control. dude needs put blast. keeps going tv making sound like it‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs problem everything control, lies Oh, guess I‚Äôll wear mask now. NBD Community peers lack authority enforce anything. agree you, read, president would overstepping various states many states like federal control. 
IMHO federal mandate meaningless, unless local authorities enforce. much enforcement going now. Still see shops allowing unmasked poorly masked customers in. yeah either full fine/arrest non compliance let ride. people lives know. Yeah, stocks go up. Dont forget averages. 

So, tech pharma way lot sectors way down.

Yeah, worried catching coronavirus get airplane, mask no. fun begins.  They'll always what's best bottom lines. Grocery stores important essential business cant afford closed though. least mask requirement, strict enforcement, they're making positive step forward.

Itd nice capacity limits enforced somehow keep throughput customers high enough meet store people's needs...but every store servicing thousands people weekly community, theres many hours day people get groceries.

My local small grocer took covid restrictions really seriously 5 person limit April may... line block 4+ people almost day. hard get everyone needed groceries capacity limit. 


So TLDR: Enforced capacity limits would great theres lot people need food many hours day people shop. big grocery stores always busy. Walmart already cespool filth, matter? challenge.

Outside process errors performing test protocol, sources error are:

Contamination, yielding ‚Äúfalse positives‚Äù
Samples without virus, despite infected patient: nothing this. always lag infection virus detectable via swab. ‚Äúfalse negatives‚Äù aren‚Äôt false all. virus may inside person wasn‚Äôt swab.

To knowledge, SARS-CoV-2 proves shown match anything virus built detect.

As someone else pointed out, Australian research found 100% match large set gene sequenced samples PCR-positive samples.

More broadly, essentially tests human history yield true 100% accuracy, humans tend awful processes sterile process particular.

Could thinking go follows....the largest institutions employ largest amount people, also multinational corporations. Typically, takes decades companies expand size. Losing companies results massive job losses come back decades company lost. 

Thinking airlines particular. employees across various continents, routes fly, substantial barriers entry industry including capital costs, logistics...etc. 

The cost losing massive organization potentially global impact (defending organization) jobs lost could take years recover from. 

So, everything keep organization solvent, including paying people off, allows potential company rebound rehire without destroying network infrastructure company built out. 

I agree pretty much everything shitty right now, happening long term consequences massive institutions failing far worse short term consequences bailing out? one works Walmart gets paid enough enforce this.

P.S. anti mask something, wearing mask knowing it‚Äôs essential also required law. stating breathing without mask foolish. movie. 'the death *rate* low"". Death rate deaths /cases. Please try keep up... infected require hospitalization. 

That's wrong. I'm going use America data, hardest hit nation thus numerical data.

As July 4th, 2.8 million people infected 858 people per 100,000.

As July 4th, 107.2 people per 100,000 cumulatively hospitalised due covid19 (source: Thats 1 8 cases, 12.5%. (Honestly typing out, thought would lower, I've committed now). confirmed cases, rate lower. note well hospitalizations occur elderly. Now, since places like Africa much younger demographic, lot eventual hospitalizations might even happen, thus adding much strain.

Again, feel developing nations going suffer, totally help. seriousness Spanish Flu.

Thank detailed answer. saying folks would even upset fed gov try enforce mask law? sucks ppl dont wear masks. Basically done nothing effective prevent coronavirus far. reason number positive low Japan low testing rate. example, Tokyo hit highest record 243 tested 3330, 10th July.

Probably thing actually notice lot businesses understaffed. kinda scares ‚Äúessential worker‚Äù stores requiring masks. Unless forget I‚Äôm jersey it‚Äôs state law since March it‚Äôs become norm me.  Jeez don‚Äôt know feel üòê Kroger, floor employee ask customer put mask. snatched mask employee, put on, ran store. Manager come cop (who Starbucks) went track down. said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs battery, lets get him‚Äù Dude buggy full alcohol meat. Cop asked stealing. said yes. Removed mask. Cop said arrested yesterday, right? Yup. Also dudes clothes security tags them. Definitely need raises. Everyone panic, sniffles loose! Second wave lockdowns, bankruptcies, unemployment surge, recession, whole package...  I‚Äôm okay this. hate timeline. Meanwhile actually won‚Äôt enforce it. Exactly!!! people seem understand drug trials work. let's real here...most trials going fail phase 3 one reason another. need realize even though many pharama companies working vaccine, may end one all. Granted get clearer picture phase 3 trial results start coming in. Lmao ffs. approachable people I've ever met someone actually tried fight physically, told em fuck off, and...gah. We're fucked lol.  threshold example meant... I‚Äôm knowledgeable enough designate measurement would need be... saying I‚Äôd like set number trigger closures. sad part is, UK kinda sucked handling pandemic. mean, LA metro area half total population canada... Illinois city, know Aldi, Dollar General, Family Dollar enforcing even requesting outside posted signs. asked employees said corporate initially said enforce quickly backed off. worth altercations day. way anyone could possibly follow Walmart's lead hire mask bouncers. hopeful becomes trend. I've done part keeping single weekly shopping trip alone time infuriating go occupy building inconsiderate assholes.

I sincerely tickled development. billies can't watch football nascar anymore can't even go Walmart. slowly boycott everything love left Goya refried beans eat watching grass grow. Oh, humanity.

*edit tickled ticked. Delighted fact mask wearing viruses remain liberal conspiracies. keeping virus stats much anymore. 40 percent positive test percentage one time. Seemed reasonable two three weeks 10 percent random people might get infected, typing yeah that's much. Maybe, let's say 3 5 percent. 5 percent compared 0.... guess Tweets sent trying strong arm astra zenca release got election time. [And meaning anything comes us said that, know right?  said.... crash couch? Idk it‚Äôs happening Alabama mask order... shockingly progressive! I‚Äôve one 200-300 people honestly people keep showing don‚Äôt even know friend knows host. 

The house disaster, mud dirt everywhere, stuff wrecked etc. hardly room walk. Don‚Äôt recommend 

Edit: COVID was. Sweden‚Äôs. US, half hearted lockdown. it‚Äôs plan /r/thathappened Link website. I‚Äôm sure lost, actually work kroger right atleast store, managers ones forced talk customers, us floor employees. atleast aren‚Äôt taking bullet much later think would come up? Sounds like you‚Äôll set meeting three. know, greater good Florida Arizona Georgia
Southcarolina California Texas Damn thought MI sure makes think u/DrunkCanadianGuy drunk Canadian guy? üòÇ Metro market Found article looking death numbers Texas. explains happening numbers inaccurate. may never really know many people dying Covid-19 there.   Yeah that‚Äôs Trump, who‚Äôs narcissistic sociopath.  Basically. again. Surprised? really. according politicians, ""cases, cases, cases!"" Yeah she‚Äôs right course. absolutely absurd Even Trump wore mask - get program dude. #**üò§**

AAAAAAAAAAAAAA God, hope many like you... Living regret. Please vote not-trump year. Actions take noticeable. could refrained would conspicuous. everybody knows he's disarming fighting virus. Him. guy know asymptomatic people could spread it. moron. everybody know did. Okay, means get much much worse thanks government ineptitude. fucked. Everyone leave house work needs raise. not. I've lot experience getting blood drawn pregnant 3 kids I'm hoping means OK, haha. possible put mask safely. safe take mask safely. possible adjust mask safely.

Anybody who's working mask last months would understand this. gonna say this, got first. Hopefully Nuremberg like trials make politicians face justice. others well like influential pastors, etc. know intentional? 

Who take cues want sure you‚Äôre protected virus? thousands others serious danger. thousands others left permanently affected. thousands others work (if money thing). 

And slowing down. serious. would explain Tom Cruise, it‚Äôs bat shit crazy. 1.3% vs 0.1%. Still 13x flu. I‚Äôm planning going getting spot front early record show. Herd immunity ain‚Äôt happening coronavirus. don‚Äôt impart lasting immunity reason. makes soooo nervous. live Texas, whole thing become brutally political. Leaving decisions Local Health Department means it‚Äôs making call based opinion. 

I would felt waaaay better threshold, like mask mandates. Something cannot debated... like 100+ active cases results school closure active cases 100 two weeks.

Instead, health officials may like sheriffs... ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt shut schools... people gotta go work.‚Äù don‚Äôt mask, Walmart stocks 10 different brands made Wuhan. somebody say wonder? Doubtful. COVID possibly 40% asymptomatic generally mild otherwise. continue circulate silently infects someone who's susceptible serious illness. It‚Äôs possible. Look universal, open month ton cases (see r/Orlando). widespread Orange County public work likely exposed. university Georgia‚Äôs new tracker county 50/50 chance exposure group 10 people 99% chance amount people higher that. risk people getting sick, dying, overwhelming hospitals operate non-essential amusement park nothing corporate greed. also want add even work, employees need eat go...air conditioned break rooms masks bc they‚Äôre eating. Sadly, guys never learn lessons. Gonna pay price. Sad truth Maybe mention wife operating room exercise freedoms wear mask surgical procedures. mean isn‚Äôt hard concept. wonder happen start go back normal get sick again. havent sick least 7 months due avoiding germs possible. Wonder immune system weaker stronger. Doctors scientists seem problem criticizing protests people wearing masks, continued lockdowns. protests also covered First Amendment, not? too, worked really hard get are, I'm glad still taking seriously. way works dont get tell russians isn‚Äôt offensive. hate mitch every bone body, please leave russians it. Russian language isn‚Äôt exclusive bad people, mocking it, mocking russians. know probably dont bad intentions, trying make aware. can't really fathom anything pathetic checking peoples' karma breakdowns. Well plan, US say wearing mask store since March. says it‚Äôs community spread. 

Even though odd person coming it‚Äôs us socially distancing answer. grim reaper Governor though? need vote better. Bigly true. Well positive note may soon able receive home dialysis. trump said virus democrat hoax cult decided follow footsteps refuse wear mask. look like joe rogan's mentality Shots fired. saying police fix drugs violent community? LMAO.

That like fixing broken dam gum. bound fail. need address problem starts cracking. know system work. Lets build something better. made clear transition ignorance, willful ignorance, intentional criminal negligence. point removing someone position acceptable. See also idiot letting Florida burn ground. close been, ever, wonder? might know later, right?

Especially rare side effect? Insane we‚Äôre late pandemic mask order *still* isn‚Äôt widely enforced country. California, businesses (at least county) requiring masks since March. CA also wondering we're left out. No. didn‚Äôt happen. already going lose. mean 100% effectiveness 50% participants 0% 50%? 50% 100% participants? interacting other, imagine situation likely *help,* maybe spirits/convenience.

Strangely refreshing still wrong. FYI case 'effects' (noun) Paranoia! manage social media couple weeks want vaca. think mean polygamy. can‚Äôt stop love! would per-citizen voter weight bad? world would unfair country? Sooooooo tired guy needs Bane mask start saying things like 

""No one cared put mask""

""Do feel charge?""

""I'm crashing Walmart trip....with survivors!"" It‚Äôll even better TVA phases coal, summer air quality east like LA smog. they‚Äôre sending best leadership new governor Michele Bachmann/Uber-Karen sent US senate. need armed officer door Walmart Kroger next person enforcing it. Also, absolutely cannot checkout line checkout without mask. time, too! Disney re-opening children dead parents identify better storylines Disney movies future. Trump: I'm confused, stores say starting immediately? Oh no. Stop. Don‚Äôt. I'd like hear people like news politicians administrative bean counters. 11% mail rebate thing bullshit way run ""sale,"" works guess. worked started 11% thing. first ran 10% rebates, HD Lowes running 10% sales too, said, fuckit, let's go 1% further! Hell, 4/5 customers forget mail rebates anyway! clearly misunderstand China bad 
It's even funny anymore It‚Äôs 0.08% Belgium though NY State many people left NYC. governor, ask. wouldn‚Äôt even office hadn‚Äôt rigged elections get there. Thank candid acknowledgment. respect accept even though saddened angry damage done country love. Good lord. heard one. Bs news. Kroger required week enforce it. People care themselves. clearly don‚Äôt believe risk Covid first place. inside, packed together, yelling. get bed late June, jeez Texas trouble. mean get bad,the cops likely get too

they wont working coughing dead I'd agreed months ago, right soaring infection rates need systemic approach. quarantined much earlier handled things back February / March, look are. right faith cops jobs exactly high. surprise Utah county, one conservative places Utah.

The real question masks political. argument proscience versus antiscience. voters really, boomers live forever reason





Except dad Yes disease control data shouldn‚Äôt given fucking center disease control.

FFS. Agreed. think news general globally tends US-centric.

&amp;#x200B;

I also think bad might sound, people almost expect developing countries struggle...these countries struggle much general, even COVID, surprise people. Whereas, US, ""developed"" ""world power"" makes surprising badly. JHU tracker thousands less fine...  People social distance may less dead,.study says Narcos season 5 Shit headline, article cancerous site.

In short, assaulted employee asked wear mask, crashed vehicle store , backed store tried run people parking lot, tried run people road highway. 

So I'm guessing likely tried use vehicle weapon cops too, ended him. makes sense people can't get adequate care die. maybe less severe patients sent home. Unfortunately, COVID progress sick sick near death death quickly.

On optimistic note, doctors learned good management strategies positioning patient facing down, drugs steroids helpful cases. mean... that‚Äôs true. There‚Äôs reason dedicated pediatric hospitals.  Okay snowflake. I‚Äôm terrified there‚Äôs going mass shooting targeting people wearing masks August. anti mask people aren‚Äôt annoying Karens want speak manager. They‚Äôre fucking bioterrorists. Decent people don‚Äôt seem grasp far gone psychos are. 

I dare watch OANN. people radicalized 9/11 hijackers. 

If go Walmart shithole like Texas week, please consider conceal carrying firearm. guy fishes  haven‚Äôt Hermosa Beach then.  People pretending like nothing going on. school shooting forever. yes, works shit gets real Glad live area doesn‚Äôt issue. Haven‚Äôt seen handful people Kroger wearing masks last 2 months. also can't watch movie TV show anymore Hollywood critical trump. actually causes people brain pain

It does. Existential crises suck experience - crying, grieving lost dreams paradigms, breaking old habits... . *However*, critical part personal growth learning re-asses react world around you. classic quip ‚Äòthe definition insanity thing again, expecting different result.‚Äô

They‚Äôre bad enough so-called coping mechanisms, cognitive dissonance ostriches sticking head sand fingers ears excruciating. like kid pain - know things aren‚Äôt going think based world works, don‚Äôt enough observational skills knowledge realize pain coming from, much less fix it. They‚Äôre emotionally/developmentally age 12-16ish. Mormon church husband's co-worker going WDW Friday week. Hubby straight told needed quarantine/telework 2 weeks gets back. also told going work. conversation happened daughter tested placed quarantine. hardly goes anywhere likely caught imagine many people catch WDW. Ugh do, 1.83 million reported active infections 1.64 million reported infectioned recovered. Username checks out. I‚Äôd tell employee fuck right hell off. realised Jons Hopkins thousands fewer US deaths Wordometer. different? Hey don‚Äôt forget good ol Texas Arizona /r/woosh Illinois here, local Menards face mask policy, people don‚Äôt wear correctly, don‚Äôt care. permanent half dollar sized rash back doesn‚Äôt look like things links. One shows hands/toes(chilblains) Plus governor says everything ok need worry Florida biggest numbers entire crisis. Like boss says ‚ÄúIf stop testing much numbers go down‚Äù Kroger may worse Walmart too.

Just observations around central IL. 

Walmart OK first, recently got really bad one masks. 

Kroger always kind iffy. surprised bit always seemed like place people knew better would versus Walmart.

The couple times went Target past months almost everyone mask. Though way less traffic either. They‚Äôre right, gone Easter 2023... usual expected outcome

of represented

in legal charlatan "" professions "" handled quite well. probably hired cop work duty. Cops appear uniform, full police powers, second job. departments let use squads too. I‚Äôm worried packaging food comes in. touch second, I‚Äôm wearing mask, put basket, hand sanitizer, there‚Äôs basically chance ‚Äúinfected‚Äù it.


Similarly: touches box second scan it, she‚Äôs wearing mask (hopefully) practicing hand washing sanitizing like everyone be: slightly higher, still low chance.


But keys day, including I‚Äôm wearing mask. touch time I‚Äôm home diligent sanitizer store.

It‚Äôs protecting gross keys. It‚Äôs protecting cashier working *during pandemic*. It‚Äôs important protect others protect want keep thing control.


I think lot people confused actions difficulty grasping concept. look too, guys. That‚Äôs doing. wonder shit getting bad here. Today nearby Walmart rent-a-cop enforcing city/state's mask policy.  big step greeter, symbolic.. ish. believe Ada County made official mask mandate, least there's that.  Now?! Good them. anyone going click: woman cleared virus, went physical rehab, counted recovered. 


Then organs failed. 

Rest peace, may daughter's able grapple loss. lost parent 15 took nearly 10 years recover. Well think made Bill Gates, much floored people spend time browsing things stores. understand amount time &amp; amount things touch cause risk usual. get stuff &amp; get out. Family thinks I'm nuts going inside store, get &amp; get &amp; go every week &amp; around anyone pass virus onto after, I'm one risk &amp; yes, mask hell up.  US: Really? Let try this... mask protects shit coming mouth, mask protects shit coming mouth.

It‚Äôs rocket science. Don‚Äôt mouth breathing Neanderthal. New Mexico ran circles around NYS's handling shitstorm. ain‚Äôt smart enough play dumb. 

Unfortunately, think smart enough he‚Äôs  really good playing role.  Nobody went Harvard moron. let‚Äôs say that. He‚Äôs playing religious good old boy cause that‚Äôs audience wants. he‚Äôs snowing every one else act underestimate him. He‚Äôs passing kind laws. Screwing environment, taking abortion rights forth. media focuses can‚Äôt put mask instead. wins. see obvious BS clickbait headline, skip hit Google news site covering cancer.

Heres better one: save click, relevant info missing spam version (including info couple articles went mentioned link above)

In short, assaulted employee asked wear mask, crashed vehicle store , backed store tried run people parking lot, tried run people road highway. 

So I'm guessing likely tried use vehicle weapon cops too, ended him. Vaccines next year? live NYC we‚Äôre best case recovered right life pit dispare. Many grocery stores scared enforce it. People still want even government mandate place. I‚Äôll believe see it.  Never go full Florida Six months late That‚Äôs I‚Äôm seeing - 27 28 day lag. Looking case counts last 28 days assuming deaths follow curve scary. biggest problem capacity limits, utilized system place tell front end many cashiers need front. worked either two stores I've worked everyone else I've talked said worked. current stores worked properly almost two years I've they've come twice said works now. No, doesn't. Hopefully I'll able ask people leave wearing mask though ü§û ended. Basically they‚Äôre favor delaying start date give us time make decisions give teachers training. 3 seemed favor virtual distance learning said also favor returning brick mortar see decline cases. 2 distance learning also happy risk reduction strategies lot impracticalities, holes, contradictions. they‚Äôre dead set going back want use delayed start come solutions how. super intendant seem give opinion feeling she‚Äôs leaning towards brick mortar. also stated don‚Äôt enough students desks lose funding lay teachers. said state government accept distance learning FTE hours. Things looking good matter decide. STARTING July??? WTF???? hasn‚Äôt thing months already? Based. misleading headline Hold on. scientists UC Riverside /r/Coronavirus subscribers, set study purpose proving superiority /r/Coronavirus subscribers? That's incredible. 

Here thought taking objective look latest research global pandemic struggling contain, desperately need better understanding why. Thanks clarifying! waited five months ~ chance hell defiant customer physically removed store allowed enter.

They'll probably call police. nothing changes, 10k Texans die middle August. probably late stop wave, mitigated going forward. 


Your state government care die. need mobilize massive voting campaign November try override gerrymandering Bill gates wrote article too. still one brother-in-law passed March (not COVID related). think perhaps need read xenophobia politics humor. Future meetings also postponed manner... middle meat cuts sold large loss. things still somewhat profitable chicken hard come awhile.

Interesting. dont shop Kroger, mainly due location store. noticed meat prices jumped often stock. No. Masks 100% reduce spread. someone wearing one could flooding room viruses. Masks reduce flood viruses trickle. Freddy's worst. far. Cops refuse wear masks good luck #1 Pneumonic plague airborne, much worse bubonic variety, sort thing may well curtailed form disease. TLDR Sometimes wonder though. I‚Äôve jobs always enjoyed brief moments outside. Rounding carts might welcome break them. 

That said, always return cart.... starts top... I‚Äôll free ! What's best case scenario US, going end? [Look anti-science Republicans taking masks yell old ladies eating  Reimbursement rates/amounts covid (how coded billed) less much costs treat it. words, hospitals generally lose money covid patient treat eat excess costs. ban elective surgeries also reduced amount insurance needs pay out. I'm hoping places require masks not, opportunity cost arguing employees gets high people bother wear mask. *you* idea many academic reports released Covid every single day? Scientific verification takes lot time think.

I'm even saying particular one make sense. I'm making fun tens thousands redditors use jerk comments feel good giddy themselves.

Don't read much it. difficult fairly easy set universal standard case (positive test), different states use different definitions ""recovered"". I'm hearing ""Kroger, largest fucking supermarket chain fucking U.S., still, even fucking now, requiring fucking customers wear fucking masks still fucking fucking July 22!"". üòë still ass hanging out, right?  couldn‚Äôt get bed even life saving kidney transplant. Sounds like something someone gay Jamie would say. [A timeline Gotta earn darwin award! We'll know results trials made public. world would saved President Sanders im slightly hyperbolic. point take reins save world. much unnecessary suffering cant sleep night one truth. truth. travesty media agencies reporting truth stead keep making numbers.

Lol uk hasn‚Äôt stopped testing. think China crazy batch testing Wuhan. 6.5 million people 9 days.  oof, website. even that. people say can't breathe fucking liars. know damn well can't choke death mask on. They're liars trolls. way Delta worse Spirit. July 15th? grace-period deadly stupidity? deaths 7-day average 1k week two, head upward 2k beyond.

 [Was looking Trust Government sides isle time low.... Trump takes full advantage manipulating people simply telling want hear.

It help know people voted first time around b/c wanted watch world burn. think people want buy type freedom anymore. goes freedom exports. Precisely. unemployment high US, health insurance tied employment, I'm concern/belief less people get flu shot usual year. Add people afraid going Drs, Drs close physical office spaces due rising case numbers (my Drs NY--it made difficult get appointments long wait now). Funny quickly we've strayed 'afraid catching breathing air'. anti-mask people kind fear Covid-19. I'm pretty surprised fast vaccine coming along. Went 2 years couple months Get masked people there.

Chain doors.

And burn place ground.

Or keep pussies watch covid numbers keep skyrocketing. What's embarrassing took stores long. applaud this.  Thanks dad. Well that's disturbing. Without masks, virus never going slowed controlled  administration bark full errors. Still 4 dollars hour average hourly wage TN.

It's enough mortgage car payment. Help us, please. Nobody coming save us. Local jurisdictions voting mandatory masks potential penalty $250 would fought court.

They're concerned many cases court instead many coronavirus cases overriding hospitals. Yeah remember Target worked mid 90's. called asset protection plain clothed people walking around. recall Target away least plain clothed ones possible legal reasons. Ideally use curbside pickup reasonable form accommodation, safety everyone else‚Äôs. Please don‚Äôt delete comment Florida ends many deaths. gonna land lot karma r/agedlikemilk Good luck them.

Local jurisdictions voting mandatory masks potential penalty $250 would fought court.

They're concerned many cases court instead many coronavirus cases overriding hospitals. needlessly endanger others laziness, eh. Try. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp explicitly voids local mask mandates, states order face coverings fight pandemic. thought wear masks entering shops already sister-in-law took dad nursing home exact reason- dementia, likely even remember much longer, even allowed visit him. goalposts already moved ""rebreathing dangerous levels CO2."" someone needs ABGs. 1000 people dying day, millions dollars economy lost every day election horizon... think every shortcut taken. know vaccine already manufactured, distributing seem like big issue really want get done quickly. Everyone said 2 years minimum vaccine, well going like less year. Everyone saying December earliest...I think much earlier that.  fully admit I'm probably overly optimistic.  He's clearly targeting black people Atlanta.

problem solved. What!? 10,000 US citizens turned away border. tried vacation go shopping pandemic border closed. Geeze people get memo fucking pandemic Canada closed borders!?

Selfish dipshits. embarrassment. sorry Canada. Americans selfish turds. Stay safe. live LA county surprised. Perhaps it‚Äôs people county. think well. people probably don‚Äôt know anyone it. people know people work. don‚Äôt know anyone outside work has. see, it‚Äôll hit someone close hard fast realize. anyone really surprised? He‚Äôs fucking moron like brother. No, story misremembered it, follow yea honestly, quaratine period 2 days weeded couple positives Although UK Florida underreporting, believe actual number infected people UK much Florida. UK‚Äôs early herd immunity plan notorious led much undetected/unconfirmed mild cases. death number tell federal state governments broken it‚Äôs basically fallen fucking towns counties try salvage country pandemic. 

The vacuum leadership incredible. Defund police? Defund whole fucking government, *worthless*. 


Worse worthless. walmart sheriff officer site well security guards times I've Krogers once, distinctly remember almost entire aisle ranch dressing Welcome team, Alabama. Better late never. think came way? No. tithing settlement ask full tithe payer take word it. given penny say yes that's good enough. give two, maybe three weeks hit 100k infections/day consistently. month long lockdowns. 

*What economy?*

No countries economy wrecked lockdown. 

If anything think country suffer economically short lockdown. Medical debt, people missing months work sickness, long term health issues, consumer fear, lost tourism revenue. Ugh, supremely shitty. basically exact opposite reaction could take. One side pretends exist nothing curtail human behavior side seeks take extreme action possible engaging extrajudicial killings curtail human behavior. know either path better since guarantee death without knowing even saving lives overall (if wanted try perform kind cost-benefit analysis). 

To get everyone US ""buy-in"" seriousness disease, likely murder millions skeptical/stubborn people. One state executing non-mask wearers deter people 49 states Cartels murdering people Columbia do. Good! 16 year old girl who‚Äôs first job doesn‚Äôt need yelled scorned following company policy. 

it's funny idiots wear masks, treat people working middle fucking pandemic like personal valets. many think complete permission assholes everyone. governor seems like smart guy knowing made good decisions before, doubt actually happen. Considering time left schools re-open, could trying lie low piss people piss case needs help(not I'm expert politics anything) turned karen week little ago people wearing masks Kroger. Called manager supervisor everything. Nothing done. ""i asthma,""

Then stay fuck home avoid dying COVID!

Any health condition would make mask difficult sure co-morbidity risk. That's sad hear. I've never worked stepsister pleasantly surprised told unionized. Really shitty effective one.  Ah, ""the craigslist penis effect""... easy average standards low know that's crazy business try accommodate new rules regulations spending money new air purifiers ect close anyways. Correct, macne caused mask, fabric doesnt determine reaction, wearing mask it. Macne way caused amount MAC product caked face pores. What? things come Europeans. Definitions caucasian race come Germany Indian thing comes Columbus Italian. things predate United States country.

/s sure shit arent gonna turn tide giving up. mean, make quite bit sense. takes one infected person completely fuck purpose lockdown makes, start whole thing again. imagine cartels want go back way things way get virus control. Can't get control people breaking quarantine, cartels best.

Not mention I'm pretty sure cartels want families infected either. coming weeks America going make 1k deaths day look small That's logic ""pro-life"" wing America. Pro-war, pro-capital punishment, still somehow ""pro-life""... fair, Trump said everyone could get test, said nothing getting results dont know would say ""most"" since cities 7 Walmarts. definitely ""Some"" would agree Welcome Costco, love you. live Pittsburgh. shocked many people refused wear masks continued say believe real know anyone it. :( Well hoping Canada France someone could write angry letter something.... Japan could send PlayStations..... *chef's kiss* still, what‚Äôs point getting tested? CDC recommendation 2 weeks even positive.

Even it‚Äôs contact tracing 26 days even didn‚Äôt quarantine anyone contacted already time get die spread  tend think masks effective six feet distance (e.g. one restaurant study people across room seem infected thanks air conditioner). even masks 70% solution physical distancing 60% solution, 88% solution, better either alone.

Nonsense. First all, tens millions Americans locked couple months. I've idea rock living under, missed little bit news, worth time.

Secondly, missed point completely anyway. point even mid-February -- China locked-down many millions -- Fauci could still imagine thing happening US. That's catastrophic failure, person in-charge time know impact covid would really china. 

Completely wrong. Anyone paying attention knew millions people escaped Wuhan ahead lockdown, scattered points unknown. many others knew then, Fauci damn well better says nothing Fauci going claim knew future would hold relatively unknown strain virus.

Current studies suggest mask wear reduce infection 40% 60% wearer. protect others even more. Yes, improper mask wear reduce effectiveness. justify willful decision try. simply means need pitch try harder.

Fuuuuuuuck. course it‚Äôs already starting.

In fact, fits OP thread. observation would invalidate thread - fine - I'm sure bothering level. I've never even seen Kroger Larger Walmart?? ""Pneumonia"" Yeah, they're constantly shitty things changing save face pretty quickly. Like initial ""hero pay"" $25 credit loaded onto loyalty cards places getting actual hazard pay. Kroger follow enough look like bad guy. think place could suck much working Walmart, I'd say Kroger definitely does, least horse shit I've experienced there. Oh yeah makes sense. Thanks helpful answer!  Ok. I've never even heard Kroger!!!! largest supermarket US!!!!!! (I'm poor/lower class income, maybe rich people thing? WTH Kroger???) happening NOW? Walmart. solution test every third child infected, first two, positive results /s 

r/FloridaCoronavirus/comments/hrg3e9/every_third_child_tested_for_covid19_is_positive_in_Florida think it‚Äôs totally possible Health Officer right thing face criticism can‚Äôt take more.

If public serve causes grief realize want die die badly, reasonable thing move on. I'd say 99% chance correct. conceal carry protection, absolutely tons lunatic carriers walk around gun itching start trouble use it. Why, recently work vendor Kroger owned store , employees home delivery department working elbow elbow small room nobody except wearing mask? cashiers wearing masks "" chin diapers"", nose mouth exposed. got store quickly could. gonna talk talk, ya gotta walk walk. That's exactly are. losing cashiers stockers daily hire 6+ time keep 1 2 Cranberry? see happening Walmart's sincerely doubt Sam's Club Good luck Kroger goto sings stated manager confront customer upset them. specific live. Check website regional public health unit, give guidance. asymptomatic positive, generally still need quarantine two weeks, 1) know became infected, clock starts day took test. 2) incubation period virus several days.

Again, region specific, gave done Ontario. thought process get every single one dwindling population vote, lose. want ask anyone make sacrifices, want tell bad news, ""eat-your-veggies"" recommendations like wearing masks able go church, tax increases, please always vote us, here's guns, look I'm holding Bible, also punch minorites keep y'all motivated... 100% things toast, minority put forward policies people like. see! Thanks giving actual answer.  cut time different. There‚Äôs delay CDC, John Hopkins use different cut time. Siberias fire.. wonder videos epic walmart videos. cdc pages I've looked mostly care deaths tests 10,000 drunk driving fatalities 2019 (and totals include drivers). dont suffer economic devastation stop drunk drivers.

Meanwhile, we‚Äôve crossed 140,000 fatalities corona 1/3 time forced shut many businesses destroy livelihoods ‚Äòcontain‚Äô even level. yet plenty jackasses proudly walking around infecting killing thousands people ruining tens thousands livelihoods.

There absolutely heavy fines wearing mask imprisonment fines enough. They're accurate 24/hr cycle based GMT, numbers get reported later day get pushed following day. Also trackers backlog numbers previous days, whereas others report raw number new cases day. daily numbers never line perfectly, overall trends pretty close. Right! need make subreddit inclusive. several videos different races Karen's freaking wearing masks. black Karen's bat shit crazy workers afraid say anything. 3 different videos want post I'm sure told like post black Karen's.

However, guidance within US contradicting vague. feel like (from US perspective) we‚Äôve forgotten President focus getting 2nd term (for God knows why). city live in, Ontario, masks mandatory months, stores. numbers dropping now. honestly understand many places (*cough* US *cough*) implementing tighter restrictions whole time. Let guess, think (D) leaders actually better job (hint: they're not). COVID otherwise. Better passive approach businesses government general taking... get downvotes, I‚Äôm 100% mask wearer wearing one since April. However, someone gifted one cloth mask I‚Äôve bad reaction it. Twice now, I‚Äôve sort panic attack wearing it. felt like getting less oxygen. 

Honestly felt like dying started small gained moment almost full panic. clue mask particular didn‚Äôt take either times, scary.

I wonder there‚Äôs something similar going here. It‚Äôs irrational body reacts real way. course assumes Someone tried wearing one. point trying sound debate people like this. You‚Äôre simply called murderer that‚Äôs that. ifs buts. Maybe move China see life like there. can't believe giving 5G pass. point, ya do? Dumbasses gonna selfishly stupid things step every one else. Things get way worse gets better. That‚Äôs true... comparison got little overwhelming counter huh? Scurry along, back training Denied happening first months? Sure, definitely taken seriously.  Conversely, general public worn face masks start (even cloth ones - even made themselves), many people getting infected hence hospitals overcrowded.

Which think would spread quicker: virus hospital, virus outside hospital?

Hospitals much easier isolate infections outside.

So Level 4 Biosecurity Labs too, matter, let's mention happened there, eh fellas? amazing. Hopefully stores this. extent wear masks protect others ourselves, momentary lapses whatnot shouldn‚Äôt really make big difference. That's good. see rangers taking seriously, hope that's attitude across Canada. she‚Äôs asymptotic that‚Äôs less likely spread it. Combine mask wearing don‚Äôt see issue. Temperature checks literally pass enter businesses it‚Äôs pretty standard.  Sounds like horrible idea lol... resisting order wear mask, wonder officer would handle that. Maybe even anomalies.

That's I've spending last four months apartment, go shopping visit office week (alone). literally going last years. Even form vaccine 2021, going get doses regular people 2022.

Seriously. 2 years. Even Biden elected tries national shutdown mask mandate, governors thing says.

Management security ones say anything Watch dumbfucks try put stop too. swear theres secret pact people solidly believing distant time, herd immunity exists.

I think small things make difference.
Like wearing mask properly. check glasses, glasses fog up, gap. 
when wash hands, check washed properly using color powder like eye-shadow. Put your

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* announcement, suddenly CDC longer allowed get Covid-19 statistics go directly Trump. hmm, seem comprehension issues. say Latinas say? education system failed I'm truly sorry that. Maybe tell Latina wife 25 years I'm racist.

Also, part specify ""your generation"" entitled? mean part dumb asses flood beaches bars, COVID parties (the guy Texas get Darwin award way), yes would entitled wish. interesting latched generation entitled, never said thing.

I told people put masks on, single anyone race. could tell poor girl arguing wanted move away her. mentioned Latina fervor calling people want wear masks Karen's, pointed specific race. Herd immunity theory, one accomplished months perhaps years. testing take longer come back positive new york back April. relatively quick test turnover compared April. Honestly point can't remember, seems likely new york could delayed week two. think amount upvotes really weird. US No. 1 Former West Virginia trailer park resident. confirm. moves mask position, probably not. Maybe tucking face shirt could help bit. Workday
Missed one. Thanks heads-up. list updated point anything doesn‚Äôt cause? remember reading speculated Chinese forums.  Chernobyl wasnt bad, saying. 3,141 counties (including parishes boroughs) yeah within country states within counties operating different levels. state 88 counties 7 mask mandate (last checked). UK stopped testing comparison useless. 

You pulled ass. anything testing gone up, local hospital turned section car park mobile testing facility weeks ago. everyone clapped. seen signs, less quarter customers wearing them. personally don‚Äôt care doesn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs easier wear mask make people already aren‚Äôt paid enough jobs stress it. Attempting please Emperor. butt mah contatoot'nal writes..... Thanks  Considering disproportionate percentage covid deaths linked nursing homes (which actually underreported), haven‚Äôt focused attention efforts demanding transparency nursing homes, terms numbers reporting, changes protocol better shield residents?

I see attention given issue, far less warranted, almost zero demands accountability. Oh god remind little girl üòÖüòÇ doesn‚Äôt access gun she‚Äôd something like that. got toy vegetable knife set (for play cooking) used toy knife pretend cut doll. She‚Äôs sweetest kid though, ... interesting imagination lol That's rough, sadly come surprise I've time see American culture is. I'm glad made Canada - enjoy me!!! thank well wishes. I'm sure I'll get things culture shock dies (hopefully...) particularly shocking time experience daily life US first time.  I‚Äôm getting test done Friday. hope don‚Äôt wait 26 days results. sucks. told somewhere around 5 business day turn around time. We‚Äôll see. may Mother Nature saving human race Indian food almost killed day. I'll still eat delicious naan chana Masala till day die. embarrassing Phase tests safety, safety proven. Usually phase II III aren‚Äôt done together, case are. individual getting trials done, makes difference. makes difference people testing least say thank everyone that‚Äôs singing trials us. interestingly, something like ""masks lower oxygen levels"", actually really easy cheap proper research. Buy pulse oximeter Amazon $20. recommended someone Twitter recently, eventually pivoted want wear mask virtue signaling on.

And said, fine, can't claim oxygen levels, rather easy confirm done so. was, predictably, blocked. Surfing weed shields illness look else would C stand /s know technically spread exponential increase month May Infertility diagnosed 12 months trying without success 35, 6 months 35. really. tried meme point Earth's atmosphere 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen 1% argon oxygen smallest atom. breath in, think breathing *not* O2? missed. America 4 months late lol. important bit - Parliament votes ban foreigners buying bolt-hole homes. property, pleased say. Why? Because, like Germany, real democracy, cashocracy want mofos change that! coronavirus Ba Sing Se think need let minor drug offenders go keep jails violent people, ect. going need room said anything *wanting* happen? Predicting something likely advocating thing. 

I would much prefer US got it‚Äôs shit together. could see grandparents die, one thing. can‚Äôt travel across border visit it‚Äôs shit full COVID. incidentally definitely kill heart kidney-damaged grandfather, already barely breath sitting down.

So yeah. I‚Äôd really love situation happy ending too. Good, hope rest GOP ""business usual"" @$$holes follow suit well. hell talking about? ""Named Republican assemblyman Mulford, signed law governor California, Ronald Reagan, bill crafted response members Black Panther Party lawfully conducting armed patrols Oakland neighborhoods, would later termed copwatching."" first paragraph wiki. 9/11 still pretty huge. yeah things like H1N1 apple getting rid headphone jack definitely less significance. confirm.
Source: see username. Jesus. located? Lol. Interesting timing - post close - mean ü§îü§îü§î Ah, wish jobs hiring area. welding shop making $20/hr still open. majority factories here. Lululemon Canadian company often exception pricing differences items. scumbag. read something staff quarantining inside nursing homes. sure common not. Surely doesn‚Äôt seem sustainable. Lmao sure, masks kill virus. Go ahead breath virus Karen! Darwin works mysterious ways. good everything enforced every single Walmart? Unless employees given raise policy go nowhere dumb. thought largest Walmart? According clinician New York reporting virology podcast, cases seeing 3 4 week period mild cases never hospitalized, hospitalized short amount time. still small minority cases. u live? Exactly. good friend asthma nurse old. wear mask everyone else too. OP, sounds like people ""packing heat,"" slang carrying firearm, outside IHOP, diner/restaurant. serve Rooty Tooty Fresh Fruity Pancakes pancakes fruit sound fun. probably push require masks close IHOP led one wait line ICU? Isn‚Äôt someone close death need icu? Also, state don‚Äôt mind sharing? like sounding like r/politics user but... Dictator trump Thanks legal argument would true knew sars-cov2 out. Breaking government mandated quarantine carry legal penalties own, HIV+ people quarantined beyond sex without warning consenting partner, I'm sure even know. coughed people, picked produce, licked it/coughed back would different circumstances well. Otherwise can't expect people stop breathing, knowing still chance spread virus mask I'm sure case that.

Of course would different mask mandate place, trespassing business required masks. Redditor's Almanac predicts long hot summer issue lead stormy fall.  announced market closed yesterday. Sorry trying come rude Idk mixed 2 up. Thanks correcting government makes sorts rules laws hope enforcing 100% time. point change people's behavior. Making murder illegal prevent people committing potential punishments stop people acting anger. Threatening fine people wearing mask stop everyone going maskless lead people either can't afford loss money want deal hassle wear one. people wear one, slower takes COVID ""finish journey"" time buy medical system save lives. COVID-19 likes this. Oh know mods /r/waltdisneyworld banning talk covid one reopening threads removing comments showed concern covid Kroger's largest super market chain US Walmart largest retailer world? everything weird broken competition size now? thought saw people crowd wearing masks. Turns neck beards. governor shops Walmart? important ways spend time ? knows. He's stupid, he's evil knows playing dumb maintains loyalty brain dead red hat crowd.  Rural dimwits think know better CDC. never going go away. Well seems pretty obvious molecular oxygen two atoms smaller virus goodness knows many atoms

I see point anti-maskers is? bad states can't defund police departments bit give bit leeway schools right now. ridiculous cant count virtual teaching anything right now. hope district comes solid plan. Well literally published today ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Call county health report them!  Mexico always someone door every bank, store, mall, restaurant checks temperature kicks wearing mask. really can‚Äôt win them, won‚Äôt go inside. duty cops make 40/hr standing grocery stores live. definitely expensive, works better. Dont fooled... lot corporations protect themselves. Customers employees much harder time using contracting virus make masks mandatory. Now... good thing yes, motive still ""america money yay!"" driven lol feel exactly like this. know everyone position health wise sign up, really encourage us think humanity. Probably already are, we‚Äôre short testing capacity ever get high officially. suppose possible. think odd praised stepping overseeing one world's worst responses pandemic? Well, blame misunderstanding coronavirus testing errors  wasn‚Äôt misstep - [this suggests countries early mask adoption 100x lower mortality. ‚Äúmisstep‚Äù likely costs tens thousands lives US. Really? government force wear seatbelt driving. even then, risk life. risk lives others would work.

But money it. get large scale. [Are hospitilizations reaching genuine plateau? another explanation (like people moved hospital care)? seems odd hospitilizations would plateau new cases stopped rising. curious. able go outside safer socialization big help now. mean parties, like low key sitting around outside small family friends group. winter North? That's whole different story. Where‚Äôs popcorn? failed *ice cream"" salesman. quite steak gambling, like we're talking low-demand product here. Yeah, without question. 1918 time blood letting still treatment people still debated doctors needed licensed not. John Hopkins research institutes born Spanish Flu. Facemasks became staple HCPs uniforms Spanish Flu, imagine avoidable deaths mandate day 1.

SARS-2 would devastated world conditions. Certainly ICU cases would fatality, alone would triple IFR. We'd assume large portion hospitilzations make either. 

And spanish flu ended influenza strain mutated back norm, seasonal flu (the deadly strain devastated world much anomaly, terms lethality, bound mutate less deadly strain eventually). SARS strains mutate way, lethality affects SARS-CoV-2 never change meaningful way. end vaccine. 1918, nearly year prior modern tech, would wiped enormous chunk humanity. agree u. That's looking outside usa, reflects usa problem trump problem. society, people, politics enabled existence. celebrity culture, money culture, ego, rejection differing opinions many more. Remember american movies favour underdog? one man must always go suggestions others win day nothing patriotism desire freedom? 

Trump logical end that. 

Truth is, underdog often wrong. Patriotism always right thing do. Freedom also always important thing. part lot important things countries cultures value. noooo, america throw ""freedom"" around regardless care. comes back bite you. Actually, Florida especially Texas greater populations New York. much ballyhooed exhale valve non-issue. Droplets stopped directed downwards least. 

Do glasses fog wear mask? That‚Äôs everything blowing top. Yes, are. Thanks. hope right, I've seen nothing encourage companies claiming they're close capitalize stock speculations. COVID-19 attended protest went home new friends. yesterday much aware care one bit. someone cheated way office [attempted get 12 black school board members put away felony voter fraud charges- literally shame idiots!!! Lol scientists can't find vaccine right away, instead, find way alter virus glows UV light? animals genetically modified glow dark. scientists genetically modify virus glow UV light, could see virus floating air, surfaces, someone's hands face, would definitely aware know right away avoid clean. thought changed 2021. often achieve 9/11 cancer? Heart disease? flu? drunk driving? seriously. walmart leading national mask response. can't wait see tomorrow store us, aliens maybe?     see sub's mods expect sub stay apolitical clear division attitudes along political lines. mean, getting ridiculous. see elephant room (no pun intended). Don‚Äôt forget us CA! Oh yeah, disagreeing. adding saying lot businesses governments within America still responding all, least appropriate ways. proactive, something. I'm happy see positive policy changes, matter late minor. think says something badly whole thing handled expectations slipped far, are. Thing is, actually experiment won't. anyone monitoring they're door? I've seen lot people masks around chin noses they're store. Mods delete title misleading fuck seriously hope companies enacting mask requirements stand call police customers trespassing refuse comply. 

I nervous sheer volume people flip stuff like enough backtrack it.

But also think get lightly else would done already.

I also wondering split people forget purpose masks work technically part face noses poking top. get technicality all-or-nothing effective whole? cousin got Covid church, beg differ. guess depends live. I've never heard seen ShopRite ACME life (except Looney Tunes). say low risk, sure mean. said air circulates better bus. said weeks ago, work contracts and, clients get like this, quit. I'm infosec, issue finding contracts. 


Fauci hard time finding new job either, even retire honour, think cojones me. totally believe says people.


The contrast professionalism Trump's uselessness striking, see Cheetos chief wants get out.


It takes guts work conditions...  Ok Kroger, ‚Äúthanks waking fuck participating‚Äù award fuck wait long implement this? live isn‚Äôt one store go without mask point, way since late March early April. think???? troll especially fucking stupid? science gone far?! think going mostly women upset this? remember Italy topped 300 deaths day cried read news. seemed shocking back then. I'm numb. rock man-bun, always wanted try growing hair anyways, perfect excuse it. Though hair fairly nasty knot, realize happens long hair lol. Yet virus rages on...  rest us, wearing masks like we're supposed to, want get kids back school, want someday travel Europe, want see businesses remain open safe, stand assholes? Id like see peer pressure. someone grew mostly white town, yuuuuup. Cops don‚Äôt seize assholes absence brown people, choose different targets. Done! disagree, believe people see coming changed opinion elected county sheriff came flat stated they're enforcing Governor's orders week ago. idiotic. Full blown retarded. Watching üá¶üá∫ also report number cases recovered. least lessen blow bit. Anyone notice, there‚Äôs anti maskers America I‚Äôm avid beach goer, I‚Äôm pretty sure drinking day beach leads crowded areas indoors people met beach. Hmm weird get info study get crap article, thanks... 

Again breathing blue mask one crappy materials two things happening. One, breath going around mask filter. Two, breath going crappy material. N95 barely stop virus sized particles that's without exhaust vent. 

Please find real study back claims. actually read it.

It's also way weird ever article study found says settled science. 

I guess read things referenced you. 4 months ago? people mean 'the market regulate itself'. Bring country close total collapse possible even companies take measures loose customer base. Yes no; Bubonic plague common form, untreated mortality rate 1/3. Pneumonic septicemic plagues, contrast, nearly 100% fatal, quickly. Computers may twice fast 1973, average voter drunk stupid ever. Might well wait Monday!!! WTF Ohh well. Next time wear mask try remember take slow, steady breaths. 

Be safe there! Took long enough! hope pulls ok. Sams Club too. I'm manager one. get black shirt bar bouncers tho. RIP us. Coffee shop owner super disappointed police failed shoot, even beat, health inspector. Boring comment, went local kroger last week first time 4 months, used pickup lockdown, 9 10 people masks worn correctly.  WFH taught anything, it‚Äôs people called way many pointless meetings could emails. way less stupid meetings things efficient. course hate drama. else would post publicly every day drama bitches always causing it? I'm American boss. protests absolutely needed happen. everything could try things right. timing sucked needed happen.  would thought med insurance companies taking losses due expensive covid hospital bills rolling in??? Pandemics one part nature, 20 parts politics. Many managers seen.

The humanity. Walmart mandating masks gonna like NBA suspending season? We're gonna see every store following along? guess better nothing. 10 year old came day concerned friend‚Äôs parents haven‚Äôt explained masks friend saying don‚Äôt anything. daughter told ended explaining friend masks protect *other* people wear protecting other, even going detail spit particles everything. friend made huge deal hard breathe mask, daughter needed wear hers, already freaking ‚Äúso hard breathe.‚Äù hours later, post-mask-wearing, ask daughter mask was. ‚ÄúOh, fine. don‚Äôt know big deal was.‚Äù

It‚Äôs unfortunate know friend‚Äôs parents making huge deal masks, kid never chance form opinion it. Even worse friend‚Äôs mom studying become nurse. 

We happen cyberschool kids (have past 8 years), I‚Äôm concerned upcoming school year, hope parents don‚Äôt try derail efforts keep students safe brick mortar setting.

Also, username reminded Peace Talks came yesterday, thank that.

Good luck whatever decide do. take long. /s wear take off. going major pain ass employees inconsiderate adult children. Krazy Kroger Karens going go well. I'm going guess InfoWars preferred station 4 months late. country needs him! Wish people like government. bad Lol...RATCHET HO another Sartre fan read watched *No Exit.*You correct. Hell forced perceived people. Jesus.. share Walmart Monday. wife tried tell man mask doesn‚Äôt work it‚Äôs chin. employee shushed her. I‚Äôll believe see enforcement, before. believe thoughts sweet would wasn‚Äôt Ivanka's dad. [Apparently Aldi's official policy enforce masks want give Karens time buy food starve death. raiding tombs uses data points around world see big graph.

It also updated several times, see marked text. recently, June 06. see right header author's names well bottom graph worldwide data.

It's always best check sources dates. :) It‚Äôs store feel safe honestly. comments blowing mind. Finally  TF waiting week? Good. reality international organization nearly every country board.

If say ""policy makers advise masks public settings"" without studies data back it, well think that's going go down? They're science-based organization, sadly live time media difficulty reporting/understanding that.

I agree though, could done better - perhaps trying correct public perception misreported. employee, sent [this (cropped remove identifiable info) long blame someone else, we're good. wait!? Hospitals would getting money sick people, insurance companies. Insurance companies pay bills. Insurance companies seeing lower medical loss ratios right elective surgeries preventative care significantly decreased pandemic. Elective surgeries expensive health plans am, driving car, point going 100mph directly toward cliff. I‚Äôm going step brake, though. Let‚Äôs hope best possible outcome. Seriously- makes face hurt think many times I‚Äôve seen ‚Äúwhat tell no?!‚Äù

It‚Äôs private property- kick fuck call police don‚Äôt leave. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è really gets me, country moved core external conflicts, Trump can't muster strength save us facing biggest internal threat since Spanish Flu. sees numbers

He ignores anything like. expect 77,000 new cases 1,000+ deaths tmrw, can‚Äôt stop winning start today? takes week write signs? that‚Äôs insane would‚Äôve taken lot extra time. sanitize hands go shopping.


That‚Äôs completely different touching keys handle day home, public, work, etc. damn time fucken pisses much. profoundly hard hearing completely rely lip reading still promote it. suck up.

These people need taken shed shot. gene pool better without them.

Btw actually mean that. condone death sentences expecially vigilante style. saying feel sort folks. anything probably shows major flaw American Culture expecially education system.

It make feel better sometimes tho. faults issues... atleast thousand times better people... arent small minority either.

Seeing dipshits makes feel like absolute perfect role model. (When reality normal dude hearing loss) using shopping cart anything, mind asking? One way fix production... dancing Hitlers? Ya, that‚Äôs pretty damn shitty there. Ok, added list. man black? black need get ASAP start protesting globally brutality. Also please elaborate, must cover NOSE MOUTH. already see someones elbow, around throat, etc., Canada? Actually per capita Belgium followed UK: go death rate Yemen followed Belgium: United States lead testing per capita: Last heard LA, SD, Santa Ana starting year online only. Unless schools recently added list online classes.. So.. using Chinese data make inferences? people want make money would least pushing masks. huge chunk problem people don‚Äôt want everyone see makeup come mask. short term ish behavior hurts brain. Like even good economy, see effect. authority ration pretty much everything WWI WWII. Food, metal, gas, name it. people dying they're big snowflakes put piece cloth nose mouth, no-brainer. means story fiction lol Still catch much *not work symptomatic.*

Not exactly blaming employee here, government wants support temporary economics fucking public health never said federal gvn‚Äôt mandate masks. don‚Äôt believe authority. 

Which call failure STATE leadership. Every state mandates masks months ago. that's Florida overtook us.

We hardly tested anyone couple months ago (and no, current state testing Florida comparable respect). 300k official cases Britain, antibody tests suggest real number closer ~~3 million~~ 4 million least.

If sucked hard, might actually higher case count due better testing. Regulation mean stops people owning guns. makes really difficult crazy ones it, limits type weapons used (only hunting) amount psychological educational tests done every year together heavy fee justify owning gun. Plus every ammo fired reported authorities afterwards.

And obviously, guns would allowed public places, hunting areas. Yeah, course. real positivity rate going much lower. high means there's way cases know checking for. Sooo people dont masks? can't afford provided? 

I fortunately provided mask work. others arent lucky? accurate numbers? numbers support regular old flu. tried find regular #'s flu cases body count can't find. regular flu cured numbers added covid? Homeopathy nothing medicine. remember surpassed 3000 deaths 9/11. Thought would trigger dramatic change dealt this. Silly me. Science = Witchcraft Well that, think vaccine latest end 2021. would study something meaningless? help? hope wasn‚Äôt publicly funded. Instead studying intelligence people wear masks, research something might actually benefit pandemic.  Lol he‚Äôs probably confusing It‚Äôs late. can‚Äôt wear mask, can. Kevin Karen dick poor reading comprehension. Reread second explanation. explicitly state education made free, must counteract devaluation degrees increase drop-out rates altering admissions system meritocratic national reduce financial costs degree, lower productivity lower intelligence individuals pursue degree. devalue degrees whole, probably increase prestige cost degrees top-tier universities. way circumvent make education free**, nationalize higher education centralize admissions. Make purely merit-based. way, degrees still value higher education available want pursue it.

Reading must hard you.  Englishman River Falls, said happened two weeks ago. There's excuse Americans island, unless sort essential travel, even would need quarantine 14 days. population older many small communities resources. infuriating happening.  Funny article said 1 case imported title states it‚Äôs mainland, somehow tagged good news. 

Moderator ban guy clickbait provoking conflicts. that's 31% children tested 31% children. getting worried.

The high positivity rate related living family, one household member catches virus, do. 1000% guarantee gonna happen. ice cream fine, sounds like screw franchisees. (Too many inflated costs, allowing stores open nearby, etc.) trumps man USPS postmaster general, he‚Äôs got mail ballot locked in. says doesn‚Äôt want mail ballots, he‚Äôs lying. mean Trump donor first postmaster general [in two decades rise agency's There‚Äôs reason lack federal response pandemic. 

I really hope it‚Äôs huge coincidence Trump donor appointed postmaster general right election approaching situation COVID gets worse day day causing maybe mail ballots come election day. Politicians always going politic. Walmart twitter FIRE. Theyre going far comparing brownshirts. Insanity. Haha ok and? pull quotes CDC employee said 60% hospitals actually participating providing data? fact entire idea streamline reporting process help reduce current delay time one week? CDC employees article agreed good move. What‚Äôs horrible this? Pleas enlighten me. even work data day2day basis? Inaccurate reporting makes reporting useless. Yeah like conservatives claim care national debt progressive getting control, conservative comes sends spiraling control without peep conservatives.

People need stop repeating narratives conservative dramas, they're 'the economy'. They're they're contrarian trolls things like seeing flustered, explain behaviour nearly every thing. States still government. see federal government mandating masks every state would somehow worse state separately. state mask order surrounding states don't, might help while. soon order lifted, pro-plaguers non-mask states eventually infect everyone else. know current expert consensus reinfection capability COVID, high enough, end single person carrying virus. that's alright, citizens stop crazy people, police's job. Even manage get illegally would still minuscule number compared availability crazy guys guns today.

No one says can't gun responsibly, hunting game would report number bullets used authority every time finished hunt what, used it. would required intense psychological educational testing every year together heavy fee justify owning gun. guns would allowed public hunting area, otherwise instantly go jail caring gun public, let alone use it. deflate lot unnecessary violence educated people still get gun end day right way! KROGER GIVING EMPLOYEES EXTRA COMPENSATION seems one best articles I've read üòÄ. Yea media tends hype outliers. reality seems nuanced... 

- people 60 likely OK, illness pleasant... Feels way worse flu., 
- free pass wear masks though people pre existing conditions elderly risk.
- even high risk individuals household, spread diseases helping crash local hospitals.
- lastly anecdotal evidence covid causes permanent damage enough data make general statements yet Thank god!

I assured 45th POTUS higher temperatures make disease go away, ‚Äúlike miracle‚Äù.

Mission Accomplished! mean since beginning state (NJ) reporting cases deaths CDC. think majority americans think acceptable right now. read thread someone predicted 12,000 kids would die school year opened regularly, think lot americans roll dice. is, one loved ones, goodness know pandemic! sssuper serial. Hate country. Butthole armpit, friend. Butthole armpit. Maybe individuals. wore full p100 respirator work summer working outside manual labor 10 hours never felt like restricted airflow enough notice negative impact. 30 coworkers. affect O2 saturation healthy individuals realize. Neither realize destroys economy. Even care killer, always thought GOP cares economy. try! signs there. Anyone studied 20th century european history would see heart beat. wish hyperbole. WISH drama queen. don‚Äôt enjoy thought poor citizen nation hanging cliff edge. believe it‚Äôs due differences time zones reporting hope great suffers *absolutely severe consequences*!!! little baby? WE

ARE

IN

THE

FIRST

WAVE signed up. 

Not sure I‚Äôll selected one 30k, want part can.  told someone whose opinion value issue oxygen saturation it‚Äôs CO2 buildup that‚Äôs problem.

This called moving goal posts. matter pretend science say, gets disproved, they'll move next pretend science thing. CO2 buildup ""the problem"" we'd seeing lot surgeons, doctors, nurses ""problems"". work long hours sometimes literal heavy lifting end breathing heavily. Someone please explain need 4 days make masks great again? can't mandatory masks made effective immediately? UK went pretty hench lockdown, like even England we're nowhere near normal levels people socially interacting moving despite re-openings stuff, three constiuent nations continue fairly hefty restrictions.

Masks also mandatory Public Transport they're going required confined public spaces 22nd England(Dunno specific face covering policies three they'll too) 

Mostly like actual business 'infecting' pretty closed virus moment, terrible response relates early phases February March ideas presentation(and implementation) leave lockdown westminster, terms getting public really cut seeing people, seems alright, although cases spiking we're really opening shit seems they've finally come round masks.

Herd Immunity remains terrible idea virus fully understand bodies immune response too. Wow, Republicans sure know choose them. list long, could start list arrests peaceful protesters standing street yard.

But look topic above. Petty theft could simple summons. gonna book release point? tie officer hour add jail costs what???? community gain that?

Americans often forget justice system benefit community. individual victims businesses. prosecutor referred ""the state"". community benefiting system broken. realize he's killer dense understand? honestly hope right. I'm extremely concerned running supplies health care workers rate going America. We're already hearing dwindling supplies remdesivir sedatives use need intubated. CFR look like circumstances? estimate 1 5 needs hospitalized. think sustain rate infections weeks months end without seeing rate deaths going up. test supposed allow warn everyone contact with, quarantine, get tested, avoid infecting/killing people. Letting someone know 26 days ago, might infected seems.... suboptimal. Yup that's pretty much exactly saying. nutshell narcissist appears genuinely believe best person world president US.

I disagree details. personal wealth one example. actually president past century who's personal wealth actually gone down, presidency, course that's hardly fair lied inflate wealth power. well could staying same, still far less recent presidents like Obama, Bush, Clinton Bush. personal financial gain quite make sense. think still sees America mostly people kinda like idiots know want understand need. ego thing. needs come realization know better everyone else everything. 

The difference two way try stop one reinforces other. Hence think understanding head space useful. 

I know everyone thinks saying sort excuse behavior. way supposed letting easy. anything worse. 

Everytime give detailed response, ironically even ones bring back examples handled covid 19, gets banned political though. Gonna short nap. one week delay? make effective immediately. many people get infected waiting week.  work hospital recently we‚Äôve rotate working entrances screen everyone comes through. wouldn‚Äôt believe many doctors non compliant. resident come without mask told needed mask offered one scoffed, grabbed it, didn‚Äôt put continued walk hospital without one. It‚Äôs aggravating something shouldn‚Äôt enforced first place, let alone like said, don‚Äôt get paid doctors salary deal attitude. version 2010 gold medal game watch either gonna Moderna Oxford end misery. Constitutional right peacefully assemble petition government redress. That's government can't legally ban people protesting lockdowns. Constitutional right tan weight lifting gym. wrong. Smallpox polio vaccines made months got banned telling masks indeed work questioned sources names like maskconspiracy.org basically blogs insane person quoting facebook. Haha, they're fool tithe payers. think meant full tithe. Nothing spells failure like billionaire I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs intention doesn‚Äôt state reporting system? Couldn‚Äôt get reports state add numbers ourselves? Won‚Äôt make look extra silly he‚Äôs pushing different numbers states? gather energy. stay home, then, wear mask shield even helmet, finally, gather motherfucking energy. Lol like 30 people nationwide cause real freakout type problem. Generally 99%+ customers quietly comply. Lot people could died pulmonary virus. 

/s still coupon yugioh check get 5 dress shirts 70 bucks though, right? leader delusional narcissist followers love blindly follow something. would acknowledged real problem worn mask himself, wouldn‚Äôt become politicized. mean deaths still man, research see smoker, think ‚ÄúGosh, hope gets lung cancer dies. It‚Äôd serve right‚Äù? That‚Äôs sorta...psycho. Americans told special free. leads society people think rules don‚Äôt apply family. love country lot improvements make. benefits don‚Äôt understand wanting make country better critiquing somehow unpatriotic, I‚Äôm sure culture weird people countries. agree you. people taking seriously. small minority taking seriously unfortunately visible minority. Tentin Quanratino? say island? feeling goldstream could wrong. Also, detour island? literally take ferry here, else go lol. Fuck pisses good job far type stuff that's going set us back. Freedumb vs. Mask. Dumb free masks. intelligent survive. already got states pay inflated prices essential medical equipment (like respirators) sent feds stole respirators. Pls sympathize urge jump ‚Äúthe world ending‚Äù train, history absolutely full revolution civil war. It‚Äôs uncommon all, takes less you‚Äôd think kick off.

Current conditions: mass unemployment, looming housing crisis, poorly managed pandemic, loss trust democratic system (by sides political spectrum), loss trust social contract, escalating partisan tensions, eroding international alliances, widening wealth gap, tech allows rapid social mobilization scale...

Governments overthrown lot less.

It‚Äôs point yet. saying couldn‚Äôt get little bit like sticking head sand screaming ‚ÄúAmerica special‚Äù repeat. gold vids policies. Specially Walmarts  ok wear mask I'm fine Sadly lot people can‚Äôt reasoned with. Kroger owns Smith's, smiths Vegas already this. Eh, NY could acted quickly seeing happened Italy. live NYC started staying home things remotely early March, derided boss ‚Äúspreading anxiety.‚Äù coworkers same, allowed to, told COVID wasn‚Äôt actually threat would back soon. lot resistance initially, people forget Cuomo publicly disagreed DeBlasio closing public schools, sort flip-flopped Cuomo became one interested locking down. Another shut coming.

My fiance I, along ex-husband fiance decided 8 year old go school instead online schooling instead. personally believe incredibly irresponsible State Fed government keeping schools closed control.

The thing State Fed concerned re-election money. went Walmart yesterday, 90% people wearing masks, people look like weirdo wearing one. 

The people state, one reside love, deserve fate. them. women know shrinkage! multiple times different agencies caught falsifying numbers whether accidental needs exposed. really need look nursing home numbers. states accounting 80% COVID deaths nursing homes..... yet directors around country saying CMS stating 1,000+ DEATHS even though haven‚Äôt single case. exact situation Florida now. literally Starbucks/Cold Stone store town. almost like people spend make more. decrease mostly delay weekend reporting? hope right though actual decrease. typically weekend tends decrease reporting represent faction believes science fine Mom visited.  Oh stranger, like much!
Here's poor man's gold 
#üí∞ 2-3 days cancer. 
2-3 days heart disease. 
13 days influenza. 
100 days drunk driving. Honestly, sounds fine. That's kind point - problem country enforcing borders however please. Probably chinese psyop.  interpreted fabulous Italy topped slightly less 1000.  
The crazy fact everyday 500/600/700 happened Lumbardy, region 10M population. around 2/3 times average deaths typical day region. persistently happening least couple weeks. 24 times day. Everyday. pain frustration drive mad leaves country. RIP one case family    mean like conspiracy theory using COVID-19 avoid starting corruption trial? drive people dumb enough believe that. good thing. Natural selection work.

- say Germans geographically isolated posturing individuals geographically isolated. 



- term 'dark matter' applied context scientific modelling. Talking not-visible realised data, showing Covid-19 immunity.  Kentucky chains god forbid give employees $2/hr hero pay this. right. They're still human beings. Humans numbers see statistics page. people like me. Fate irony would end never US shut borders anyone, rather rest world would end shutting borders US, rightfully so.

Took guys long enough.... lololol GREAT SOURCE .... ahahahaahah funny. thank god able hold drinks. one works Walmart simply workers filling position, anyone specific.

From 45 30,000 ? wow...

So simply giving dose measuring anti-body result enough make vaccine. Color skeptical... Lol nothing right.

I'm obviously talking you, barber. I'm talking one reported comment. Sure, happens like 1 1'000'000 times, found later. Don‚Äôt worry. numbers run tRump run committees, instead CDC, numbers improve. Walmart actually enforcing mandate? Yup covid ratings down. get funding. fact occasionally get breath means (and gone several years) probably COVID-19 (and probably nothing worry about). Get checked though please. Never said trust him. said sounds like something would say. Unbundle panties. ‚ÄúBye‚Äù feel you, see comments France government lying, inventing virus sell vaccines, people sheep fearing second wave etc. Facebook YouTube infuriating. 

I understand logic either, really hope vocal minority.  small regional chain area still requiring masks. So, doubt work every case, step father blasted Facebook bunch stuff coronavirus isn‚Äôt big deal (120k deaths US time events, it‚Äôs something brush off)and went thing protests, posting things ‚Äúblacks make 50% crime 13% population protesters wrong,‚Äù cut life entirely. became clear mom didn‚Äôt care posted things protesters actually defended idea response coronavirus much cut too. gave statistics, investigatory reports DOJ, data CDC everything could show views weren‚Äôt anecdotal ones still didn‚Äôt budge. mom gone two months without seeing grandchild apparently she‚Äôs asked bunch black people go church supposedly mentor intervention explain stuff posted Facebook isn‚Äôt right certainly isn‚Äôt good representation Christian (why anyone would want parents mentor beyond though. 

All say, people insistent wrong things adhering propaganda misinformation without verifiable data never change receive consequence actions much justify continuing doing. escalations force, start small work way either find something works longer kind person life. worst think would happen idiotic prejudiced people attract they‚Äôll see they‚Äôll slowly die age, disease whatever else kills one wants around you.

It really unsettling reading older posts comments. statements certainty aged well. Lots strong proclamations. Also lots confusion. ""something's adding up"". ""it's like we're getting data"" ""if China there's really low risk. one guy Washington got better.""

I kept thinking head, ""You guys idea. There's reason called novel.""

I'm sure know then. I'm also sure know half it.

Stay safe :-) We're what..4 months this? anyone mask now? Looney_Toons_Intro.mp4 literally strip cloth face, chill person you‚Äôre killing going spread virus, would subsequently exponentially spread others, killing many people...

Then yes, killing person would prevent deaths long run. full support this. isn‚Äôt something often say cartels. Ever, really. never happen. businesses, executives, lower level employees vested interest following rules. hire security it, that's mixed bag.

In rational world, government would working push stores offer curbside delivery, force close public. sucks, would lot adjustment, there's good way force public businesses get will. virus many aftereffects. human centipede garbage pretending news feel like distribution also issue rate people getting vaccinated slow covid tests that'd huge problem.

heh, wait school *actually* start. report using report feature. even read comment.  place wife works like mini Costco.  people door sick fighting every effing redneck dipshit can't wear mask.  reasons read Facebook. 

Seriously people, fucking mask Rejoicing bit since maybe finally good explanation fast track ness - relates fertility-izing efforts. swear I‚Äôve seen least 15 times since March. That‚Äôs kinda creepy, ain‚Äôt see Five cases seven days? even understand possible without everyone wearing mask really good contract tracing.

It something low population density Scotland? Even two biggest cities half million people each.

No super-spreader events commonplace disease? Glad see state good! I‚Äôm worried family Texas Florida though. virus causing blood clots heart lungs brain. seen reports vaccine trials side effect yet, admittedly following one diligently believe 14 human trials right now. wish people saying yes response comment would cite sort source . Lol food deliveries bike, way I'm going wear mask unable breathe biking summer heat half US. Natural selection best, weeding stupid jugheads what? warned everyone Jan., first wave US March never ended...two months, two f'ing months... Case trough death trough 3 weeks apart, 4-5, that‚Äôs true. point 3% CFR holds though.

I think go - we‚Äôre catching less severe cases younger people tested. 2% CFR seems realistic, given 0.6% IFR many asymptomatic infections we‚Äôll never catch.

At 2% CFR ~70k cases/day that‚Äôs 1400 deaths per day. Pretty horrifying anyway slice it. would totally suffer bad flu meant babies. US Intelligence knew going November. Instead anything prep, government elites quietly sold stock assuring us everything fine. need work, need eat. time, can't...


Are people really going suck up? can't even begin say sorry earlier sacrifices literally nothing. allow protests? they're going shut see businesses shut thats news you? wear masks everywhere outside home, like entering store building wear masks.. Densely populated* true. 

Hope Montgomery buddy good, idiot can't really something even protect surrounded stupid ass misleading information media good, local Walmart full people wear masks I'm tired it. coworkers special Well Ill damned manage stay power tbis SNAFU. Especially voting base dying left right. leadership non existent. people point expect nurses doctors sacrifice like soldiers. people already pretending covid many parts US. second wave going devastating. Oh great. results all. guess couldn‚Äôt stop testing they‚Äôll stop results. Fucking really? Grow UP. fake going away. virus doesn‚Äôt work way.  child. I'm wearing cloth mask right now, must suffocating know it. wealthy means take precautions are, poor, well they've got nothing left value bled dry. People thought New York different subways Apts elevators. California pass New York cases. south LA. see people mask on.  extremely suspect. data noisy overall trend masks looks like could gone up. Masks necessary they‚Äôre cure all. Stay home social distancing importantly IMO. see using strategy us Brazil things LushGut listed somewhat preventable.  Wtf happening Hidalgo county Texas?? 66 new deaths today according Worldometers population 868k.. that's huge portion state's deaths incredibly sad accurate Yes, sad. tell me, often think human beings Earth die every day causes, outraged covid deaths? Even IFR equal flu, spreads far faster infects far many people. equal flu, we'd giant multiple deaths flu. Aha, jokes COVID. I‚Äôm shooting blanks already. God is. Thanos, course.  I'm convinced doomsday, I'm sure hell convinced majority people hanging best case scenarios like life preservers lost sea.
 
Jeff freaking Gordon caught twice, yet people continue downplay likelihood happening. read personal reports, internet (including Reddit) people account first-hand stories multiple times. called crazy believing first hand stories doctors Wuhan January saying legit, I'm sorry I'm inclined continue believe first-hand accounts media spin.
 
Yes, young healthy people dying outliers. That's things work progressive damage. First strange, commonplace. seen exact progression happen multiple times virus point dismiss things continuously they're shoved far throats can't deny further?
 
At point people see enough death lifelong damage actually admit we're heads here? We've mostly done Australia. politically messy, course, c'mon, many roads state them? want give award badly, they‚Äôre waayy price range. here: üìé *yawn* Wait hurricanes hit real fun begins. Shutting people firing dont agree you... Pettiness small even movies politician-bases themes dont stoop low to.. Bigotry highest level governing body. Monday. not...now? get it. enough masks hand entrances, it. 

And we're it, places restricting hours they're trying limit congestion? workers' safety? even that, social distancing harder crowded store, numbers show risk exposure heightened time vs congestion? 

I'm pretending know I'm talking here. truly get things. recall Alabama governor saying aren‚Äôt New York months ago asked closings, quarantine etc... Sad isn‚Äôt it? seems like defeatist attitude government official. Perhaps man consider changing career suited temperament. We're working overthrowing capitalism. people choosing distance wear masks ones supported trillion dollar war middle east ~3,000 killed 9/11. 

140,000 dead phase now. virus visible enemy deaths nationwide, singular event.

Many people lack necessary brain development see issues affecting personally take action anyway protect others. look Kohlberg's stages moral development, would guess decent % Americans stuck stage 2. ""what's me"" stage, operate personal interests. Kemp, DeSantis Ducey need celebrity edition human centipede. it's, ""This joke!"" find amazing people go Colombia vacation say ""it's safe now"".

Really? CDC laughter - genuine concern. ok there? Oh shit. Y‚Äôall rednecks owned store tend support...

Oh... Wait... tHaT's DiFfErENT good luck enforcing it. There's irony here. Foggy glasses extremely dangerous job site. I'd remove mine time got point danger benefit. know stuff like ever worked hard labor. requirement months ago. Glad see they're finally right thing.

I‚Äôve seen cause aneurysms seizures advance friends polycystic kidney disease advanced stages. Covid-19 didn‚Äôt even know disease probably take decade life People don‚Äôt understand:

1) testing means higher number reported cases. doesn‚Äôt mean actually cases. NY MI early limited testing capability.

2) Doctors informed treating virus compared March. Deaths rates declining.

We agree media sucking ass. real difference grocery stores they're owned parent company? Oooh! 

I know!

As right now, plan just, know, let us get sick possibly die.

What everyone else thinking, know. I'm thinking country kinda betrayed us all. So, that's cool. Makes feel valued, ya know? since they‚Äôre business overrun

Pretty sure would described booming business far healthcare America goes. know huge circle jerk reason america failed due low mask adherence. However appear appears highest mask adherence almost western nations. think reason America failing due these.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Even higher mask adherence, America large population 30% wearing = 100 mn wearing since America 1 country easy go 1 place unlike EU people language barriers etc connectivity increased last 10-15 years.
2. Contact tracing garbage America person gets corona get stopped
3. America opened early given number cases enforce mandatory quarantine people coming outside city/state.

I think important thing America right necessary create travel bubbles, ie allow travel hotspots enforce strict quarantine coming there. prevent future hotspots developing. Thats American, western country needs police permanently stationed supermarket....  right, guess focused hopeful fantasy Biden wins election Nov 3. I'd happy Biden gave Fauci wooden nickel, even nothing all, long Biden president 2021. thing go asking proof, get dismissive shit. country face exact problem like USA, people ignorant bit uneducated(and dont wanna shit that, country quite poor), get wearing mask important. 

But try enough, mostly talk sense them. biggest problem regress really quickly old habits. pull mask talking, pull nose 'they can't breathe' stuff like that.

And let's say, live country 1.3 billion people, there's much room left error carelessness. think USA deep shit? Wait till India really gets going. Means less benefits previously force plebs back work... bong rip day keeps covid away would love see that. Bunch flaming gay guys chasing trump around wieners out, vamping yelling ""liberate!"" ""liberate!"" believing flat lied, listening believing guy said would gone Easter. guy said drink disinfectant. know Fla shit show, maybe make less so? One hope.

Narrator: didn't. Sane Americans like: ""I want get Mr. Bones' Wild Ride."" skip quarantine like US... Hope future tests phase 2 3 go well bet really hate push make weed legal. Sorry going fix it. Make people aware issues legally force management's hand deals healthcare something it. work (the public) all. inept force office bring competent people in. Jesus that‚Äôs Kroger. out-of-state travelers really fucking states actually trying control situation. 

Um... Can't close borders? read article absurd headline. thing ""economic pain"". saw economist ABCNews24 said ""very real financial cliff"" twice. lunatic. Haha like daughter. sounds absolutely charming! he‚Äôs embracing inevitable.

Getting ahead story will. I'm guy, bro guy summarizes new world requires new solutions giving +1. Thank saying every child, parent, grandparent, teacher, bus driver, janitor, cook, auntie uncle, sibling, guardian, mentor, best friend, etc, would like say! üåû doomed!

""even god can't save cannot help themselves"" union strikes back China also downplayed threat Jan Feb could buy available N95 masks across west. truly odd virus. I'll never forget Florida spring breaker showed TV March said crap care other's well-being. Florida many cases occur ten weeks clip shown, never really entered 'enforced' lockdown (much like Arizona). Fast-forward July, state surging cases deaths. think first wave hitting South/Southwest, states north steadily increase late fall, possible second wave hit (magnitude unknown).

With mutations strains they've identified, people shown catch twice, think need clear concise messaging US government, health officials (who ones backing findings science entire time), importantly, media (Fox, CNN, MSNBC). enough data know older preexisting condition, probably leave house vaccine. young less risk virus, still need wear mask close quarters others, go around anyone high-risk category. Simple, backed science, general public's interest reduce case surges prevent breaching ICU capacities. sure I‚Äôm bothering respond given you‚Äôre 100% convinced doomsday...

1) little evidence people catch twice. cases probably either false, bad testing, incomplete immune response first infection, someone immune disorder, etc. 

2) young healthy people dying statistical outliers. 7.8 billion people happens. media likes leave part cancer patient, autoimmune disorder, morbid obesity almost every time young person dies seemingly exceptions. letting statistical outlier cases terrify you? Anti Vaxers sure rise then...but they‚Äôll hopefully hurting hopefully everyone else goes gets Mexico end paying it... Like human errors inevitable situations. Except mangos goats. tests even accurate? uncle stroke surgery covid somehow. Nevermind 2 packs day 20 ""make trains run time"" kind fascists, book burning, anti-intellectual, hypercorrupt kind. give employees enough time find own, given paycheck. like they're providing masks employees doomed! masks made myself, made I'm using mask hangs front chest, shove pocket something. nice walk pretty much everywhere; want mask case go inside anywhere can't distance reason, seems pretty unnecessary wear outside, around people. (Especially working hard/breathing heavily since mask gets wet reduces effectiveness.)

Maybe get sunglasses strap shoelace tie husband's mask hang around neck tuck shirt, hang something nearby needs around customers, get gross handling. far cleaning it, thought boiling night? masking starts, shooting starts. /s replying comment top comment Walmart thread well.

Bingo. read article? ‚ÄûThe researchers‚Äô aim IQ-shame‚Äîquite contrary. aim identify people social distance, facilitate strategies improve overall social distancing compliance.‚Äú Never mentioned one thing conspiracy overreaction Luckily nobody pursuing herd immunity strategy let virus spread uncontrolled... safer Canada right now, beautiful here, cheaper holiday Americans Canada's weaker dollar. 

And MAGA-heads give crap anyone themselves. need see dead kids. live AZ 1/5 people covid. Life wear mask. able get ACL repaired pandemic somehow. one. idea Kroger big!!! grew Mississippi went MS university, soooo many friends state never heard Kroger.

I'm foreigner Thailand. looks like get two weeks. countries closed tourists. idea go long I'd there. newest mutation: growing arms? country people allowed board planes ‚Äúcomfort duck‚Äù, I‚Äôm quite sure Walmart let people without mask enter soon claim health condition forcing wear mask. Yeah, still FAR highest death toll capita state, can't call success managed get everything control now. Obviously death toll states increase well, states (including Florida, texas arizona) still nowhere near New York's death toll. Trump literally went twitter encouraged this. told certain states ‚Äúliberate.‚Äù part effort make virus sound harmless protect economy. It‚Äôs re-election. Shot heart. he‚Äôs blame Nothing see here, ‚Äúits flu ‚Äú Tremendous. betting provide evidence specific drug deaths backup claim?  exactly surprised see million deaths 2021. Even death rate climbs considerably, many people going continue call numbers inflated. people listen, want admit happening right front face. maybe wrong.

Let's think this, Walmart currently leading national response resurgence virus. central govt allowed overrule it?


Do people really still think hoax?? would think change story every 5 days vs sides story staying would hint

Hoax, 5G towers, flu, fake numbers, look... numbers stabilized, follow guidelines say ""look guidelines work"", can't breath, they're muzzles, it'll go go away, it'll go away warm weather...

Versus

Wash hands, put mask, socially distance, limit large densely populated gatherings.

Edit: fun: anti-vax, anti-science, trust doctors... takes 20 different doctor prescribed medications breakfast every morning. Disney fully open... \# 1 seller: bananas

\# 2 seller: hope fucking childish. fuck going country risking lives ""others""? ""others"" want virus, go outside. Let everyone want live lives live them. fLu!!!! /s I'd imagine someone like douchey get embarrassed. cited side effect trial yes. 1 star 5, don‚Äôt recommend... knowledge power! filthy liberals corrupting children science. Checkmate libs

- Republican, probably Damn, feels good [Canadian] gangster different state state even county county. always count Americans get right... eventually. love side r/thathappened, I‚Äôm usually one calling out. doesn‚Äôt even make sense would fake thing, serves nobody scenario. Nobody came looking good lol. It‚Äôs even outrageous scenario either, confusing one lasted couple seconds front me. like previous male birth control Walmart smartest chain totally. makes sense call paid pay it. Covid: Good job son... potential damage organ lot small blood vessels. I'm black live Africa nice try trying hide blatant RACISM unwillingness accept minorities targeted system. embarassing. Majority places want pay cash, can't deny it. rarely use cash do, tell employee keep change. sure makes non-asshole part prob. 
Personally, I've taken cash get douse rubbing alcohol deposit onto card. know cash makes everyone nervous, hence ""keep change."" But, use best saturated dried days. Least do.  current death count massive undercount is. Death ""Non COVID Pneumonia"" time high middle summer. life shithole authoritarian country. Floridian dont even want Florida Covid doesn‚Äôt care who‚Äôs responsible... trackers never got data CDC, change much regard.

But CDC accurate data using real time death instead time reporting death.  I'm talking personal debt, mostly. I'm sure well sheltered forgive understanding working Americans deal with, negative net worth.

Actually quite opposite. I‚Äôm hundreds thousands debt student loans. median salary US lot higher median salary job literally country. that‚Äôs true jobs require college degree. You‚Äôll get paid working US jobs. that‚Äôs ~50% workers types jobs. May taken high debt worth salary able cover full pretty quickly.

That‚Äôs fundamental problem world view. view debt bad. It‚Äôs conservative talking point. Debt means good credit. Americans best credit world comes higher debt. Millions Americans willing go debt leg US economy pays off. 1 100 make big. literally 50% people. debt worth credit cheap, go debt. 

Claiming size debt bad thing completely ignores fact much debt debt ends net return investment. that‚Äôs case means access debt means better access better returns one thinks economy healthy 

None things signs unhealthy economy. They‚Äôre signs global pandemic. It‚Äôs like youre telling 20 year old coronavirus fever sign they‚Äôre unhealthy going die. it‚Äôs sign got read Vox

Uhhh think things peachy.

I never said things peachy... we‚Äôre literally living worse pandemic I‚Äôm 100 years... nothing peachy that. entered strongest economy we‚Äôve 100 years. Sure biggest buffoon 300 years fact economy entered strong position Obama, despite harm Trump did. Progressives moderate fascists

Wanting make world better fascism now? Wanting workers live country salaries higher fascism? wrong you? tried sway brainwashed minds think Covid hoax work. Everyday lose hope humanity. saddening. feeling covid deniers get significantly car accidents per capita rest general public. UK coming next week wear face mask shops face ¬£100 fine. fine chief police already said policy take sort priority guess 'real crime' (easiest way say it) employees try stop customers coming shop refuse wear one. I‚Äôm glad scientists labs work US fuck Well holy shit, foot mouth moment, thanks, check out. Big fan sci-fi seen Ice Road Truckers?? blame crappy ability govern. He's pure world could potentially give superpowers. mask that? No. r/wallstreetbets wants know location God referring to? 5,000?

Antibodies eventually fade bloodstream nobody wants huge amounts floating around bloodstream extended periods time. cause damage. COVID anti-bodies bloodstream, theorized immune virus antibodies kill virus. Possibly there's evidence reinfection.

However, certain studies claimed immunity virus lies anti-bodies. T-cells like memory card antibodies body develop. antibodies fade initial contraction COVID-19 (or vaccine prompts immune response), T-cell memory able make antibodies shows long-term immunity.

T-Cell memory means immunity confers long period time - long make antibodies upon introduction SARS-COV-2, we're effectively immune (or least, reduce nothing common cold).

Dude needs prosecuted genocide Kroger shop at, less half employees even bother wearing anything. doubt they're gonna enforce anything already give shit staying safe. states spiking right states biggest protests, Washintom, Minnesota, NY etc fine. known time outdoors activities 19 times safer indoor activities. research protest related spread: protesting spread, cancelled large number people stayed home protests, presumably avoid them. based cellphone movement data, see full paper vs indoors: ""The odds primary case transmitted COVID-19 closed environment 18.7 times greater compared open-air environment (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.0, 57.9).

Original comment: Man, completely unflappable. Focused problem hand absolutely nothing else. distractions allowed. get people like actually charge, please? effed lead member Trump administrations White House Corona virus Task Force defend against.......his administration. That‚Äôs number infections. current tests around 1.2 crore crushing bones sledgehammer. That's customer service Europe superior ;p

Can't blamed rude someone refuses wear mask they're generally rude mean average... absolutely wild. Stuff like climate denialism makes sense rich powerful benefit masses eat news tells them. can't think single person stands gain anti mask crap. going believe this, Florida opposite, forced hospitals keep nursing home patients, rather send back infected.  mean, definitely can. 

It‚Äôs Josh produces mandate, it‚Äôs Kroger‚Äôs. 

But get saying. Let Jen dairy tell non maskers day piss off. Kroger gonna boycotted entitled women patriotic males. almost want deprive medical personnel masks Wow. many relatively speaking. world live wearing mask governmental tyranny? 

It sounded like something radical type backwoods idaho people would say. anti gov ones. Never expected Utah.

I saw one veterans trump hat. Article states ""they wore Trump 2020 hats"". seeing it.

This got consequence bad science education school something. surprises Mormons, got impression, take care own..and sense community kind . Mormons surprising me. 

 

Anyway, think reasonable chance meeting become hotspot..source covid cluster. Soooo much winning spot bug causes wear red hats deny obvious facts universe part different simulation different physics models.  


I mean, clearly bug simulation, way could reality... interesting lack super-spreader events associated gyms, aware Korean fitness instructor case may yelling instructions. Every case indoor spread traveled 4.5 meters incidents lot talking going on, call centers, Chinese restaurants etc : quite possible deep inhalation exhalation associated exercise dangerous speech droplets. sounds like already taking every precaution. people gym doing? also wearing masks would suggest collectively accept risk, though would expect people make effort go gym 4-5am avoid others less likely infectious people go peak hour since likely taking precautions. (Like you) everyone else wearing masks would seriously consider it. Yeah, mean, sounds inconvenient RIP Living Tokyo. agree better role models needed. French here:

The official explanation government counting ""individual responsibility"" incite us wear mask, now. IKR Kodak moment There's hopefully balance bleeding every orifice virus triggering clotting every important tissue body. Even advanced COPD, long wear nasal cannula oxygen, they're fine. 

The worst thing I've experienced far mask wearing acne. hoping greasing wheel today, not, like FAT states soon... No, one brick wall shame. bricks particular order are: 

No interstate travel restrictions 

No intrastate travel restrictions 

Quarantine required moment test positive, moment get tested 

People working get test results

Which one part consequences little public assistance. 

Adversarial relationship citizens police thus police assistance quarantine. Police visited got tested asked way get food meds. latter knew do. 

Really porous lockdowns.

And lockdowns: companies eager remove reminders virus. 

Contact tracing? Yeah lol, nah! Neither people willingness cooperate contact tracers. 

Where apps? Voluntary contact tracing via app exist. 

Adversarial relationship media truth. e: hoax!

Etc Eh, US massive. UK handled similar New York, less restrictive lockdown, less masks came bit earlier. Yes, Case Fatality Rate (CFR) longer 4% look recent cases - CFR inflated early outbreaks places like NY NJ, testing limited compared today - testing [5 times peak first wave.

Thus, we're catching far mild even asymptomatic cases, brings CFR significantly. They've already stolen PPE shipments hospitals re-sell states. Vaccines next logical step. Honestly read months ago Chinese cases guys learning now. masks. 2020 surreal. know one guy jiu-jitsu class, convinced hoax move cashless society. Nothing change mind, even doctor paramedic class. Ireland reference. least skeptics able breed. Canada I'm sure find countries. many tendency land international news. pretty clear Socrates reference, IMHO think Wait things get really bad. 

Declare state emergency. 

Bring army enforce strict lock across Country. 

Bingo -President life. Don‚Äôt report cases, don‚Äôt cases ones cities, yes. That's always goal. least ensure urban voters scared come vote.

When need Nuremberg style trials fucks. hope end way. Lol Australia closed eyes global warming. Country fire government still ignoring it. LOL! thanks forget Ebola.  
I think spread side Asia well. 
Some even Asia. 
 
I guess countries learn. let‚Äôs open schools, quick! Finally!!!! 


Finally....

Welcome modern free world.... Like Europa think that's part problem. almost like science community needs passionate person speak behalf. Someone throw examples tragedies public. Possibly even simply logic general public. get messages stories level emotion nonsense skeptics using, solid scientific understanding reasoning. Well atleast covid finally disappear US like orangutan promised like need spread. multiple times different agencies caught falsifying numbers whether accidental needs exposed. really need look nursing home numbers. states accounting 80% COVID deaths nursing homes..... yet directors around country saying CMS stating 1,000+ DEATHS even though haven‚Äôt single case. exact situation Florida now. big trip planned January Quebec. supposed week. right thing cancelled everything. saddened stubborn tourist. wait. are. Back essential business offices working remote possible. unnecessary gatherings. hear parties going time anyway. common sense becomes uncommon, sometimes must forced. need defiance like trying times. Well done. July 22nd late. isn‚Äôt enforced today?? *employees* inadequate PPE / sanitation supplies, sure hell know detainees don‚Äôt either, all.

So far 3000 immigrants ICE custody tested positive ‚Äî that‚Äôs even little testing. reference, currently *total* 22.5k humans ICE custody according article. mean, would consistent. People still drive cars could never pass smog directly responsible thousands deaths per year. throw away plastic ocean, pollute rivers, drive cars regularly instead investing rail; arenas harm good.

If people started wearing masks caring neighbors, would exception rule. RIGHT?! Like, people like doctors professionals get promoted job bc experience firsthand knowledge expertise. there‚Äôs politicians got job simply bc promised people something campaign now... nothing. TV appearances shit. Fuck em‚Äô hate places make age high, especially plan start school. me, kid wear mask, that's kid stays home. I've seen plenty kids half age wearing mask seemingly fine. first, thought said ‚Äúmore‚Äù like...ok, that‚Äôs hard....for real though, I‚Äôm scared India. know hard core lock down, cities densely populated millions people infected quickly. Cringe Amazing, corona TWO weeks! North korea, Turkmenistan USA exclusive club corona cases! Glory dear leader! Good enforce protect lives livelihood. work, customers can‚Äôt even get front door without health screening. Security asks health questions symptoms temperature check. wait line turn enter store. time get pretty chill know asked leave don‚Äôt follow rules. Sounds like awful dystopia. shoot racoons weekly, come chickens, shoot rattle snakes farm target practice. would ridiculous pay heavy fees things use small gun for. telling city MAKE money too? Ah. believe all-thingy experts... made it... much worse. fuck tell 10x deadly flu flu ifr order magnitude less. usually puts perspective undoubtedly pseudonym (Madrigal) applaud shit suitability journalist  He's got several lawsuits waiting soon presidential immunity. Chances able wriggle those. According lack smell psoriasis, I've covid least decade. Grocery clerks aren‚Äôt allowed ‚Äúkeep change‚Äù. put drawer makes drawer end shift, get trouble drawer balancing. good intentions, doesn‚Äôt work well employees.  Protests streets, man. tried all. 

Poor people world countries manage that. home brave land free able go protest weekend, not? July 22... hell EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY? months months stupidity STILL treat *mUh FrEeDuM'* parasites' feelings soft gloves tweezers? 
They would rather keep toxic minority clients thoughtfull careful ones, many returning long time botched keep botching this?

Kroger: ""We Appeal Lowest Possible Common Denominator."" 
Their unspoken slogan. worry old donnie ordered hospitals bypass CDC go straight white house. He'll make sure deaths rise long sheer coincidence, [Walmart require customers wear facemask nationwide July feds so, would mean strategy ignoring hoping goes away failure unnecessary.

So instead, choose venerate willingness die.  non-fascist societies, lay public told death unpleasant must faced dignity; believers told painful way reach supernatural happiness. contrast, Ur-Fascist hero craves heroic death, advertised best reward heroic life. Ur-Fascist hero impatient die. impatience, frequently sends people death. feel dying? Reading comprehension hard. Nascar happening unabated? ......wow.... wonder many naysayers would change minds healthcare workers would refuse treat them. mean would focus resources ones actually helping cause. like treating one guy injured fight zombies instead treating idiot keeps getting bit since thinks whole thing hoax. I'm point wait corporations step too. sad state affairs.  Sorry behalf fellow Texans, literally terminally stupid wish could slap sense Republicans awful people expert koolaid drinkers really face charges. Verbal harassment something. go far arguably attempted assault/murder chance spread virus. recall military time. ABC suits things. Believe me, worked. situation really seem dystopia like, doesn‚Äôt it? wait Covid-25, maybe learn people believe American Sexually Transmitted Diseases Association gets involved. Yup. Close to
100% compliance even outdoors neighborhood, despite 85+ degree heat humidity. rare occasions actually go inside public place EVERYBODY masked, get impression wearing mask inside would considered socially acceptable blowing nose onto countertop. really seems unthinkable europe reading news like makes literally sense me. dont get all. Even disney world opens, people go there? florida, one hardest hit place planet right now. important disney world trip people? seriously cant wrap head around this, saw movie, would laugh unrealistic is, are, real world. would ANYONE risk lives trip disney world god sake? completely failed Corona response, affecting millions average US citizens?

That's glaring one. I'm pretty sure actions influence people many subtle ways. background? anything back claims?

Also, understand 2 weeks thing reference. why? OMG know going edited damn many guys aggressively slowing spread killer virus Could always redistribute pay CEO down...but definitely let‚Äôs guys think US broken. Anyone know repair it? day old friend mine called tell stopping visit way Los Angeles vacation. nuts think entertaining town guests pandemic. way vacation one hardest hit states country. like idiots going Disneyworld FL. going crazy reading history books later life. Annual flu deaths anywhere 16,000 - 61,000. Confirmed global Covid-19 deaths far 580,000 (Keep mind Covid-19 deaths provably under-reported certain areas world, take 580,000 ""at least many died""). think able move past ""It's flu!"" stage now. Thank good employer responsible citizen! Based this, outcome everyone wear mask rest 2020 same/worse current situation. However frightening thought inmates facilities getting ill is, thought employees said facilities getting ill **really** make freak out. Inmates stuck inside. **Employees go outside.** Inmates significant danger, safety predicated whims justice system quality care facilities themselves. stuck cesspool germs 24/7. Employees danger wade cesspool 8-12 hours day... **and bring germs outside world.** really bad news, means communites around facilities likely also see spike, even considering inmates inside them.

This so, bad.

Edit: words Hey, need public funding also like publish paper, another study. patient dies scientist. You‚Äôre assuming endgame here. seen clearly plan anything. Flinty New Englanders - keeping distance, respecting masks. 

Sunbelt people brains baked. (I say sunbelt resident...) meant easter sunday 2021. Old Donnie never specified year CDC data Trump 1984 data? Unions run Vegas. way Biden shuts down. Exactly. someone whose father died this: respect people's decision put others risk.

I respect others opinions things. this. personal, damn important right now. 140k stadium people distanced required wear masks outside seats. outdoors virus spread well (see protests)  No...at point it‚Äôs protest. put mask get take purposely wear correctly. hate mask, don‚Äôt expect right thing. Yea i'm thrilled walmart board. Every town everywhere walmart, heaps good. think week two ago Trump brought saying something every day gets angry Chinese costing us valuable American lives every day.  White House edition reality show? *sigh* ICU physician, dealing shitheads think real *that bad*

Deep know matter time catch level exposure. 

A week goes start forget direct risk.

Then get text message get work, ""fuck. John Doe (who work with) tested positive.""

So get tested again.

Feel chills freak little, ""oh shit, fever?""

Nope, time least. yet.

But do? Apparently wearing mask much ask.

Hopefully die this. silly analogy COVID chewing anyone raw. unnoticeable suddenly and, progress COVID, dying. 1/100 people confirmed coronavirus: means people know anyone virus. also Ralph‚Äôs, Food 4 Less, QFC, Fred Meyer, Fry‚Äôs, Smith‚Äôs, many more. give batons? that‚Äôs funny surprised cost. USD 10 one test. Ah yes friend can‚Äôt visit father stroke. emergencies Abbott‚Äôs management poor, really terrifying thing far behind testing even closing bars rolling back restaurant capacity enough, still wouldn‚Äôt know least another 4 weeks. think meant drive Urumqi, Xinjiang 1500 miles Hubei province. However, parts Urumqi less 100 miles Russia, Mongolia Kazakhstan. probably someone parent begin mean, lot stories really true, though. America WWII pretty much complicated divided times. 

Just give one example, thirties forties worst years post-Civil-War history terms racial oppression violence. Hitler specifically cited US system segregation Jim Crow laws existed war direct inspiration Holocaust. war also immediately followed huge wave strikes labor actions, many companies used excuse mistreat workers. people pulled together looked one another, sure, lot people also turned one another.

Sometimes history classes say things. quarantine finally got time start Games thrones. One tales around Corona tale mask works. Yes, masks work stock. 5,000 idots Reddit Wednesday thought process people really strange. ""Bill Gates trying kill us virus, let's make sure wear mask die!"" can't person whose first thought ""why supporting infectious diseases?"", I? always agree democrats. disagree lot actually. long they're republicans, guess I'm forced vote 

Republicans burned bad. They're supposed party good christian morals I've never seen Jesus would actually do.

Ranked choice voting soon please. would list 4 5. 3 apply people world, example Europe general, complying rules keeping numbers relatively low completely unreliably this. First said interfere mayor's enforcing mandates city. ""didn't want make political"". Yet actually enforcing masks statewide would angered Trump, thereby making decisions political. hey, least would let cities safe right? Nope.

He definitely got slapped wrist papa Trump. 

It's definitely coincidence 45 Georgia past weekend. I'm imagining Kemp groveled him, fell line. something wrong then? sure feel like hard breathe wear one, missing something? USA! USA! USA! u kno basically labs then
 Brilliant won‚Äôt believe bad get. One employees spit someone ask 3 times put mask back on. yet think reopening, getting rid benefits, everyone struggling look jobs, getting $600 week, catching Covid insane medical bills can‚Äôt afford going bankrupt going much better economy somehow. Yea they'd put 7 masks? I'm reporting asap conspiracy theorists  long healthcare workers quit? America going should, keep morale? facemasks Dixie flag mission already accomplished work grocery store. saw old man ask man please stay six feet away ( man mask). guy got red face screaming guy. old man quietly said, "" asking. "" told security stopped asked old man okay. guy wife, screamed old man , death glared we're following around store. call security escort step dad's car worried would try fight me. 

But no, mandate store not. :/ people pickup ( online groceries) wear though. bit extreme cleanliness too. sprayed Lysol groceries produce. One coworkers loading car sprayed groceries loading asthma attack come inside ask someone else finish. freedom. I've watched Health Ambassador ""training video."" shit, different bucket. No, vaccines purely preventative measure. work giving weakened, minimized deactivated form virus body prepare immune response ever contract live virus. someone already coronavirus, going help they're already vaccine would them.

However, treatment severe cases greatly improving there's definitely lot optimism front. They're ones potential vaccines already tested making trials line thinking irrelevant. certain demand find way make supply, pharmaceutical companies always do. 1/7th cases counted - asymptomatic, mild Covid seems unlikely infected person, disadvantages testing positive (quarantine, cost testing, loss income, etc.) seen outweigh benefits targeted treatment - talking nearly 3,000 deaths 71k cases tested positive. 

Hopefully testing higher proportion total cases spring though. Fred Meyer (Kroger) actually enforcing mask requirements live state they're mandatory. signage saying they're required greeter w/ masks people forgot straight heard telling customer policy actually stop people entering w/out mask. end end month...

 

The additional $600 weekly jobless benefits provided federal government officially set end July 31. states pay week ending July 25 July 26,¬†a significant blow unemployed workers counting money bolster state benefits average $370 week.

""The (Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation) $600 paid weeks ending later week ending prior Friday, July 31, 2020,'' U.S. Department Labor said statement. ""For states except (New York), Saturday, July 25th.¬†New York‚Äôs end date Sunday, July 26th.""

 mean say people seem convinced ""this it""? I'm quite sure almost one US saying ""Phew! got first wave!"" virus raging like wildfire there, all. He's like ""state-level"" Trump - younger Southern accent, dumb.  seem confused. incredible debate country.

On one hand world renowned one kind pandemic expert... hand leadership vile, corrupt moronic compare worst tragedies roman born 31 August 161 AD near Rome, early years reign, ruled jointly father, Marcus Aurelius. arrogant, self-obsessed character paid little attention Rome‚Äôs political military matters, preferring hunt rather manage matters ruled 15 years starting 177 AD, rule became increasingly ruthless indifferent. preyed powerless, war veterans, animals. self-obsessed renamed Hercules proclaimed living god. wasted nation‚Äôs resources statues across empire, leading economic crisis depreciation Roman currency. country saw civil war reign, eventually strangled death 31 December 192 AD. True phase 2 complete need release info they're going phase 3 judt fyi Keep fingers crossed! mean, arguably they're wrong: surprisingly large quantity state federal administrators seem intent inflating numbers act domestic bioterrorism population US ur saying sneezing someone's face risk wearing mask none are. right then. ever needs surgery maybe doctor wash hands, sanitize equipment wear mask. Enjoy infection plague old bastard. sooner get done bound chaotic, messy, botched vaccine rollout, better. Kind surprising spent prepandemic. Would saved myself.

Also, study another indicator nothing private. able identify got unemployment when, spending like after. Unlike JP Morgan Institute Study read..there mention got data.

I suppose checked bank records Chase bank customers, correlated credit  and/or debit usage may bought data banks cc companies never said that. Maybe I‚Äôm confused negations. think you‚Äôre something! man actively warned us possibility happening years ago definitely one who's trying kill us!  funny think Biden like Trump, Biden actually competent form full sentences life death decisions literally made man child, know America doomed...

I pray USA hope hopefully sense sooner later... ?

What science?

Where?


Link RCT. ""So... chosen death."" Service guarantees citizenship  NZ locked hard early, economy open country virus free. cost us, spending dollar save ten.

Borders closed tourists indefinately, returning residents citizens tested quarantined, international business (via teleconferencing) trade goods continues.

We lost tourism, saved everything else. produce food need export COVID free. Big tech wants set data centres, etc, film industry also attracted work safely (the Avatar sequels underway James Cameron's crew come quarantine). think consider options like whether starting local pharmaceutical industry feasible, given worldwide need.

When countries get virus control, probably open tourism track case case basis.

Presuming change government next election (a months away). opposition wants open border go back selling assets running infrastructure (hospitals, education, etc) increasing homelessness poverty short term gains rich (as past).

But feel bad US can't understand same. US economy resources done ever had. 

Our government even gave everyone special wage subsidy keep afloat lockdown help prevent businesses going broke. recognised protection economy without lockdown economy would likely better long run lockdown (because pandemic people stop buying save money emergencies, etc).

It possible US could woods already. vigilant keep US reinfecting us. seemingly unnecessary suffering death heartbreaking. hell Kroger? *live Texas  Well, Modi playing Trump/Putin/Bolsonaro playbook ways one. critical mistake UK made delaying lockdown week

It's possible mistake intentional. reasoning later trigger lockdown (and clearly, late), suppress inevitable second wave. I'm saying agree them, scientific advice listened it. Sure, advice may crap, published time, reasoning. virus spreading Asian countries adhere strict regulations? West thought stubborn people (see USA) get sick wearing mask. 2 new local infections example stubborn stragglers got lucky getting virus sooner? new ‚Äúwho John Galt?‚Äù doesn‚Äôt black white. want children school? brainstorm make things happen best virtual reduced capacity environment focused special needs pandemic? sounds like you‚Äôre seeing kids get needs met, however pandemic things going look different year. contribute high-quality information.

""high-quality""? (be honest) doom-consistent?

How study then?

[IFR &lt;= 0.14% 65, &lt;= 0.0092% awesome terrifying Kroger largest supermarket chain? I've literally never seen Krogers despite nearly 50 years old lived 11 cities across 8 states. find statistic suspect. Enjoy burning aircraft carrier, better us all. Ok, make opinion invalid. hear see lacks evidence respond evidence. invalid, supported current evidence unless produce some. Automatically assuming stance invalid way beneficial nothing society. presumption innocence. Without presumption innocence convicting people may innocent allowing guilty parties go free. immediately dismiss something invalid without providing evidence ignoring presented evidence open door person oppose ever gains society advance.

How obviously true disprovable?

That sounds like kind thinking Galileo against. mean seems like obviously true Sun revolves around earth. Especially common observation could offer tons proof sun fact revolve around earth.

Yes Galileo bring observations observations still rely assumptions basis opinion hypothesis. assure working Fred Meyer (owned kroger) years absolutely leave floor staff probably part time kid fucking home department get screamed every day Surgical masks meant contain spread prevent droplets spewed. low PPE time healthcare workers also 100% sure method transmission entire coronavirus task force decided that. Hi,

Can submit question without url?

I use Narwahl able to. literally wrote exact comment another post topic sub.

[F*cking pathetic, especially since shills cheer America creates vaccine resort edgy, impotent slander comes countries Believe not, it‚Äôs possible **both** recognize need wear masks, realize people (now) recommend liars.

Just somebody part solution doesn‚Äôt mean aren‚Äôt also part problem. must first honest thing he's ever said. man win preselection seat started politics ran slanderous campaign guy actually win.  educated populace everyone sick poor, would oppose dictator? Floridian, envy you. Seriously though glad government responsible. would say second portion first wave. portion wave got amplified.

Many countries funky waveforms. nice clean inverted parabola everyone. still part wave.

I would say wave ends country manages pull amount new detected infections close zero. example, ‚â§ 1 infection per 1M pop. span 1 week. case US, ‚â§ 328 infections 1 week. official specification, something made up. hell required long time ago? outside, US seems like country Idiocracy movie It‚Äôs crazy dumb people are, including fellow healthcare workers think we‚Äôre cOnTrolLeD mAN.

Got tested 6 days ago still waiting results, crazy Hey save masks rest us. Jeez Chinese communist party upvoted comment It‚Äôs so, sad two realistic choices President Trump Biden. actually 

The virus January/beginning March. mandated masks social distancing since beginning like every country....we‚Äôd possibly back normal close it. every country (New Zealand, Australia, Italy) nearly eradicated virus. haven‚Äôt dragged feet took ‚Äúseriously‚Äù 2 week shutdown end March. already late. asking day. happens responsible countries start letting citizens COVID controlled countries travel them? US citizens banned entering rest world guess insane leadership start threatening countries time comes. It‚Äôs personal protective equipment. could make say something offensive libs, even. 

I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs you. low PPE healthcare workers 100% sure method transmission.

Get it. entire task force behind statement. solution here? Perhaps law changed local order made interest public health overturned court governor? think DeSantis need class action lawsuits safe would wearing n95 mask would airport plane? still think would hazards social distancing violations waiting ticket approval relatively close one another, walking airplane cylinder going plane, takeoff landing, people would packed trying get plane. also debate whether HEPA filters large particles efficiently someone near coughs sneezes would reach Hepa filters it.

 Also I've asked 2 close doctor friends(they immunologist epidemiologists still) one said take vitamin c(but says take vitamin c everytime i'm skeptical advice) doctor says one person china contracted virus outdoors before, sources i've read said risk lower outdoors non existent. mom also makes argument okay flying went doctor(for conjuctivis, wanted ask tested covid) use elevators,i okay using planes travel method. thoughts these?

Edit: Mom's argument response cdc various epidemiologists recommend non essential travel(i.e. vacations) give Heparin + Fenofibrate (cholesterol med)    
Heparin blocks infection, Fenofibrate reduces effect infection. G√§llivare asked people stay home. didn‚Äôt lock down. closed libraries places run municipality like indoor pools. temporarily closed buses G√§llivare. 


‚Äú‚Äì Vi kan inte g√∂ra en total lockdown av samh√§llet, vi kan bara v√§dja till alla parter att ta sitt ansvar. Nu √§r det allvar, till√§gger  Last week, Tn less 400 ICU beds available. Hospitals larger metro areas turning away/diverting smaller hospitals, sometimes hours away, potential patients Covid related.

Our state Gov said today would consider another safer home order turned governance mask orders individual county governments. knew matter time Trump vindictiveness unleashed hounds Dr Fauci. Discrediting letting cronies openly attack him. Also younger population less antibiotic resistance. Looks like reasonable study, read correctly, measures achieve 13% reduction cases? missing? Dr. Fauci receiving praise djt thinks going himself. malignant narcissist djt must destroy him.

I think thinking goes this.

That move blame Dr. Fauci failures US's COVID-19 response extra bonus point view. nice speech all, coming way late. People already demoralized disillusioned. matter many facts throw them; matter much science research behind you, they're going buy family loved ones hospitalized death's door Covid-19. elected officials need stop disgusting political game they've turned pandemic start taking actions put people's lives anything else. Wish could cool well... store clerk waiter can't make people around wear mask, know?

i'd suggest policies like - 

* access proper PPE barrier - make sure every worker PPE
* paid sick leave worker falls ill, needs care family member has, exposed needs quarantine
* employee collect unemployment feel workplace unsafe/not acceptable risk

i wfh stay home go grocery store 10 minutes week, think i'd want stand register grocery store 40 hrs week, even people wearing masks. someone public freakout. store providing masks. etc.  Fuck guys Actually rhe second one CDC said masks necessary?

I mean, agree masks worn. they, WHO, serious disservice anti mask beginning endgame here. Complete dismantling US benefit Russia. 

If Orange Mutant Senile Turtle‚Äôs ego would realized ultimate stoke ego would winning re-election even complete narcissistic egomaniac would realized *doing anything* nothing would improve chances considerably. 

At point ignorance things going unwillingness anything pure malice. Nah, Swedish deaths hospitalisations. 
And yes, pandemics nightmare. N95 u/Intiqh X thing ‚Äúimported.‚Äù Blame people ‚Äúimporting.‚Äù 

Seems like easy logic jump me. Belgium, mandatory 750euro fine get caught. experts putting idea also enforce public, even outdoors, would another step forward think.

I hope US catches rest world soon. really do. Good luck guys! virus causes covid? thought covid name virus Higher testosterone People might believe religions anymore enlightened ancestors; switched idols (a.k.a. celebrities), cults conspiracies. Massive increase amount information makes thing worse many misinformation mix people revert believing convincing, modern day's context means distinctive, using largest amount soundbite, highest number supporters, opposite wielding ""undeniable knowledge/secrets"" (at least trained critical thinking) ""special few"" could learn.

Lack education, especially critical thinking identifying misinformation, heart problem; religions (mostly) longer power manipulate education information flow, slack taken politicians government form budget cut education.

In short, lot people promoting gain US soon doomed one anything that. Americans become illegal diseased immigrants they‚Äôve always feared. see that's tempting, work. vocal deniers arguing good faith statistics make change minds.

You see climate change deniers evidence average temperature Earth going actions:

- modelling shows there'll rise temperature, they'll say lie.

- see small rise temperature, they'll say insignificant.

- there's rise temperatures years, they'll look year second highest record say, ""you see, lower last year. probably falling now"".

- there's sustained rise year year can't deny, they'll shift arguing nothing human behaviour.

- exhausted, they'll say late anything carry exactly before.

If think data proving bad things change mind, think nasty surprise. Lol calm Karen.. kids live. SARS-CoV-2, virus causes COVID-19, uses surface spike protein latch onto human cells initiate infection. **heparin**, blood thinner also available non-anticoagulant varieties, binds tightly surface spike protein, potentially blocking infection happening. makes decoy, might introduced body using nasal spray nebulizer run interference lower odds infection. Similar decoy strategies already shown promise curbing viruses, including influenza A, Zika, dengue. Finally common sense OC! cases anything 'Xinjiang Production Construction Corps'? Bingo Cool - 60 days late. Well done. Kroger? never heard guy opinion article must person fail sucking hard. think main problem kids still inside grouped together everyone breathe recirculated air hours. way move classes outdoors would much safer. Fear leads anger, anger leads hate, hate leads suffering.  Hi fellow Ohioan! enjoy DeWine‚Äôs ‚Äúspeech‚Äù last night? What's current number unemployed Americans right now? Kemp reverses local mask orders. America clusterfuck ... data using ""Oklahoma already flattened curve.""? Lol.  take street get coronvirus. Good luck getting unemployment didn‚Äôt. LMFAO. send back nursing facilities quarantine area. New York lots hospital beds free. sudden side-effects extreme aggression extreme hunger. way see 2020 going. follow logic making fanatical belief people never wrong, consequently people never right. Yet history world filled countless examples people wrong. 1940's leading scientist day gave extreme cautions nuclear bomb due real fear may set chain reaction destroy earth's atmosphere. Hundreds people executed belief zero number. Galileo shunned condemned saying Sun center Universe. James Comey Robert Mueller testified Iraq weapons mass destruction.

These aren‚Äôt good arguments though, none actual scientific evidence behind them. isn‚Äôt case ‚Äúthe evidence showed then, evidence saying different‚Äù cases people believing something without evidence, evidence found, ie. Galileo discovering Earth revolved around Sun (not center Universe). 

With regards masks, wasn‚Äôt *evidence* looking effectiveness general public, didn‚Äôt want public buying masks medical personnel needed, people told use them. large number studies showing effective general public, people told use them.

Galileo good example point, found evidence around 400 years ago still correct today. could two people arguing, one earth revolves around sun sun revolves around earth. supposed treat equally means opinion valid hear make determination merits argument.

The trouble people well-enough informed make decision, hence anti-vaxxers, climate-change deniers etc. don‚Äôt get personally determine validity every argument hear there‚Äôs probably 100% chance don‚Äôt knowledge determine validity decent number them. current policies (wear mask, wash hands, stay 6 feet apart) exclusive white people? 

What would example ""better informed"" policy ""better relates"" people color, opinion? saw youtube comment blaming terrorist act spreading virus states. love mind works remember someone come elementary school late 80s early 90s explain us couldn‚Äôt get toilet seat sharing glass water. also PSAs TV. lot confusion fear. wish patience.  know doesn't, lie part appeal lie. addicted lies.

Jail fucker's sorry ass. belong normal society. everything goes well issues (that big if) first emergency vaccines produced October regular mass production November. quickly provided world vary lots factors. first couple months production probably go front line healthcare workers.

With many people think guy can‚Äôt spell hamburger struggles operate umbrella cdc guy years experience trump rape accusers ... fact USA might charge people ... might smooth sailing even vaccine ready. Something something sources methods know what's infuriating think NBC segment like that. something ridiculous like masks vs. shields entire time wanted scream.

I agree important question. explain 1000 cases lump together children, parents, teachers, etc.. break numbers respective categories? E.g. X number children, number parents, Z daycare staff. 

What cannot accomplished breaking numbers? Mama always said stupid stupid doesÔøº It‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs fine. Nothing see here. Yes, since Germans freely travel Sweden, cause confusion amongst traveller lol  problem blanket studies fact there's always false positive-negative rate. many cases false positivity falls 1-3% mark, especially new, less robust assays. hope took account... done General question at-home risk management. husband working home respective employers fortunate case. son, 21, lives us works grocery store. wears mask, many customers not. also socializes limited group people (probably wearing mask, trying keep appropriate distance) purchases takeout fair amount. 


Given risks perceive, three us wearing masks home. hate idea, think long son higher risk bracket, likely should. think especially true since fellow employees diagnosed Covid-19.

Artcile reinfection (also indicating 2nd course worse 1st): well respected doc talking reinfection he's observed: hand, oxford vaccine designed give 'double protection', apparently triggers T-cell immunity levels together gives years worth immunity..

That's interesting, heard TWiV guys said *something* similar vaccines generally *maybe* able that. GREAT news true bc hoo boy looking good reinfeciton front. link? missed one! What‚Äôs crazy White House treating like political matter, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs contradicting us, must us‚Äù Fauci treating like scientific matter, ‚Äúoh, incorrect, let set record straight.‚Äù White House wants people agree them, Fauci doesn‚Äôt care White House, work get rid Covid. 

They‚Äôre ‚Äúplaying‚Äù two separate games tools. WASHINGTON ‚Äî scientist leading Trump administration‚Äôs coronavirus vaccine program allowed remain government contractor, decision permits avoid ethics disclosures required federal employees maintain investments pharmaceutical companies.

Two prominent watchdog groups well Democrats Congress called Department Health Human Services require scientist, Dr. Moncef Slaoui, venture capitalist former executive pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline, fall ethics rules federal employees.

The office inspector general H.H.S. responded week could require shift, citing unusual role Dr. Slaoui playing administration amid pandemic.

As chief adviser vaccine program ‚Äî called Operation Warp Speed ‚Äî Dr. Slaoui working contract pays $1. arrangement, exempt federal disclosure rules would require list outside positions, stock holdings potential conflicts interest.

That arrangement alarmed lawmakers, accused H.H.S. helping Dr. Slaoui, expert molecular biology immunology, duck usual accountability required government employees.

The groups filed May complaint, Public Citizen Lower Drug Prices Now, argued Dr. Slaoui classified ‚Äúspecial government employee,‚Äù tag allows federal government hire outside experts 130 days. title would make subject ethics rules also apply regular government employees.

The $1 contract, groups said, appears ‚Äúdesigned primarily allow Slaoui maintain extensive web conflicting financial interests without need divest of, recuse disclose conflicting interests‚Äù ‚Äúprovides Slaoui opportunity enrich himself, colleagues employers.‚Äù

In reply groups, official inspector general‚Äôs office said Dr. Slaoui‚Äôs appointment expected stretch beyond 200 days, well past said ‚Äúapplicable statutory time limit‚Äù special government employee.

The inspector general‚Äôs office ‚Äúis position determine department‚Äôs decision unreasonable pursued options S.G.E. appointment,‚Äù letter, dated July 13, concluded.

In role, Dr. Slaoui significant influence financial commitments made government, far provided little information Warp Speed‚Äôs resources, agencies funding coming decisions made.

‚ÄúThe basic idea he‚Äôs really privileged position lots resources command personal financial stake industry really challenging,‚Äù said Margarida Jorge, campaign director Lower Drug Prices Now. ‚ÄúEveryone appreciate Slaoui expertise development vaccines, expertise ethics mutually exclusive.‚Äù

A group Democratic lawmakers, including Senator Elizabeth Warren Massachusetts, separately wrote last month Alex M. Azar II, health secretary, asking Dr. Slaoui designated special government employee. called Dr. Slaoui‚Äôs contract ‚Äúan attempted end-run around federal ethics rules.‚Äù

Ms. Jorge said organization watchdog groups planning meet Wednesday afternoon discuss new ways challenge Dr. Slaoui‚Äôs status.

The Trump administration invested nearly $4 billion companies pursuing coronavirus vaccines. Last week, H.H.S. announced federal government pay Novavax, Maryland company never brought product market, $1.6 billion expedite development coronavirus vaccine.

Dr. Slaoui spent first days job May trying disentangle pieces stock portfolio ties pharmaceutical interests. working Trump administration, sat board Moderna, biotechnology firm pursuing coronavirus vaccine. sold shares company value stock holdings soared following release preliminary vaccine trial data.

The Trump administration said time Dr. Slaoui would donate increased value cancer research.

In interview May, Dr. Slaoui said determined avoid conflicts would re-evaluate remaining associations financial interests stood gain new post.

An H.H.S. spokeswoman reiterated Wednesday Dr. Slaoui resigned Moderna‚Äôs board divested equity, addition leaving advisory boards companies ‚Äúwith even appearance conflict.‚Äù

‚ÄúH.H.S. ethics officers determined Dr. Slaoui‚Äôs contractor status, divestiture board resignations put compliance robust department ethical standards,‚Äù spokeswoman said.

Soon Dr. Slaoui brought Project Warp Speed, leadership underwent upheaval, part holdings, according senior administration officials.

Dr. Peter Marks, renowned federal scientist devised initially oversaw Warp Speed project Food Drug Administration, stepped aside role lead vaccine specialist, part concern saw Dr. Slaoui‚Äôs potential conflicts interest, officials said. Dr. Marks director F.D.A.‚Äôs Center Biologics Evaluation Research, office approves vaccines. Come on, that's exception. According this, findings virus airborne, decimates immunity contingency: Even everyone world gets virus survives, survivors able reproduce. end. -_- Pretty sure lot expensive too. Speaking someone obese range majority last decade, many health reasons stop obese besides increased risk Covid.  Unfortunately I‚Äôm privy information. don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs going take temperature. told deaths going stay low due young people getting infected? given....gasp.....bad information virus deniers? I'm shocked. 9 deaths isn‚Äôt bad. positive case count unchanged.
Labs used reporting health department, negative test results communicable diseases. unfortunate oversight sure, doesn‚Äôt change number cases, number hospitalizations, number deaths. realize covid act bioterrorism wearing mask fact fighting enemy side? No, scientist life. Despite climate-related social media comments conditioned us believe scientists politically motivated, care discovering truth. people, Conspiracy Facts. Personal belief Facts cause many problems. 

Why can't *ALL* people consider maybe actually looking evidence rather concluding things mold beliefs.. Well, it‚Äôs coincidental ‚Äúopen up‚Äù movement really gained steam data came showing disproportionately affecting POC.

That said, it‚Äôs also obviously taking huge hit elderly, make large chunk GOP voters, idk really political strategy. think they‚Äôre letting rip see happens. Much easier actively managing it, apparently. Okay nbayoungboylover. going South Africa? remember 80k cases went 311k 1 month KING Dr. Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser Trump administration‚Äôs coronavirus vaccine program, remain government contractor, thus shielding disclosure rules.

Come Thank I‚Äôve always thought testing really important symptoms think control virus testing number one priority.

I‚Äôve multiple mild symptoms past week self quarantined since. like consider good person I‚Äôm genuinely finding hard quarantine without confirmed answer I‚Äôm positive ( I‚Äôm getting tested tomorrow, it‚Äôs busy).

All know without testing REALLY see someone doesn‚Äôt care others much could quarantine(or long should) downplay something else. America we‚Äôre going lackadaisical go handling virus, least keep testing improve try open schools anger translator science well-worth shot. Worked Obama stupidest people given room. important decision make could consult group trumpets group 2nd graders, I‚Äôm going 2nd graders every time. Florida. data probably wrong, probably much worse reality wear masks keep licking alligators Ah yes, magical place Earth... It‚Äôs kinda funny everyone worried Vegas reality road massive problem well. Fauci President! Eh, conspiracy. mixed evidence.

I'll wear one helps hysterics who've hid apartments four months adjust normal life, they're proven magic bullet everyone's pretending are. Much general public refusing wear masks. think entirely unlikely Trump could win again? realize polls suggest we're far election claiming certainties. shit - takes expire. People don‚Äôt get test result immediately die. Today‚Äôs deaths new cases 6 weeks ago. Good him. Fight maybe die believe in. Even it‚Äôs really really unintelligent public safety standards. dumbass. Warp Speed possibly worst possible name though. alone going turn away lot people think moving fast safely test it. cluster. Ah Giesecke. Great man. Slightly misunderstood. probably mostly right end T-cell immunity etc better understood.

No wonder Salminen speaks much sense. fear rule guess. Russians healthier Americans though. Elect Stay-Curious85! Save Future!

 *message paid 'citizens Stay-Curious85 election campaign'. states kind mask mandate

Exactly. States municipalities statues (well, questionable assuming do) this. Feds absolutely not. Im sure - deaths younger folks compounded previous major issues like meningitis certainly major issue! doesnt detract tragedy lets honest here: news articles usually suppress important information cases bottom articles, all. dont think thats fair creates unnecessary panic. Yeah obvious. Yes indeed, test ongoing infection antibodies. Trump big dumb goof ""insider"" knowledge real agenda. Right? But, what's bothering me. guy constantly yelling team declining polls. understand handling pandemic what's hurting reelection campaign? used think Donald Trump ulterior motive regard decision making process. now, think severe mental condition. really do. loss smell? Fever? Trump broke local law masking Atlanta airport. 

So local laws must invalidated within hours hitting cnn. wish joking. $$$ So, opening helping economy. made lot people sick. tbh it‚Äôs good news Gothenburg low seropositivity rate

Not kind test, whole comment void. totally support new lockdowns. also understand want tourism money, like fruit-picking money incomes fall heaven, shake it. TL;DR: Dr. Moncef Slaoui Chief Adviser Operation Warp Speed (Trump Administration's Coronavirus vaccine program). works per contract pays $1. Watchdog groups Democrats Congress say main purpose contract avoid making Dr. Slaoui federal employee. Dr. Slaoui working Trump administration federal employee, would disclose ""outside positions, stock holdings potential conflicts interest.""

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide box full. think reality tv star charge understands testing important. done identify lot infected isolate area rest country 2 weeks even lockdown area.

Two parks (Magic Kingdom Animal Kingdom) open. curious here‚Äôs look they‚Äôre like right youtuber Tim Tracker. feel like we'll know area surge even without official numbers. assuming schools open planned, basically everywhere fall. I'm also US know adds covid.

I understand then, neither now. substance, pure populism.  recall originally came question, small labs this, since following instructions letter - seems also larger entity local hospitals big laboratories reported inaccurate data like this, labs like Quest Diagnostic fall list. They‚Äôre positivity rate 100% reality, 25% cases positive. Florida Department Health confirmed close 400 laboratories reporting negative COVID-19 test results them. April fools... possible, low likehood would've seen cases already.

This strikes denial. EVERY coronavirus infect person twice. single reason believe isnt true virus. question long takes.

RemindMe! 4 months Well spoken. could feel emotionally broken right myself. pride freedom turned us morphed dangerous anarchy, worship unintelligent, government corruption embedded egregious acts even elicit reaction (or worse, garner praise). fear virus destroyed U.S. body count, destruction civility common decency. worried bubonic plauge around corner... numbers sound quite low rave though? follow American Motorsports I'd imagine average race 6 figure attendences Hahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahaha already seen higher death rate minorities arent typical Trump voters.

Because virus hit democratic cities first, going ravage rural areas filled old white republicans, look Florida huge geriatric population Thank links! Fingers crossed we're getting magic bullet say. looked well enough say either way, fingers cross super hard! Fauci posing photoshoots? Maybe wasn‚Äôt bad job wouldn‚Äôt face criticism. Compromised immune system caused perceived, yet completely false, reduced airflow? 

Listen bub, doctors health care providers wear masks almost day. Hours straight high-pressure, life-and-death situations. 

Put kool-aid. Trumps endgame losing election. Instead fighting virus, course action simply trying downplay it. Fauci's job make sure appropriate actions responses made, acts upon this. conflicts donald's current plan completely committed to, therefore discredit avoid Trump losing support (in eyes). also boils tying success president stock market, worse virus means potential lockdown, would hurt stock market thus remove one Trump's positive arguments re-election. Could presymptomatic still? Hopefully mild symptoms doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs cake walk everyone else relate hard. friend mine started new relationship going vacation friends. Worst all, claims vehemently anti-Trump. Oh poor tard. started go fund hire lawyer sue guy half go fund practically started publicly shaming him.

Simple that. know virus kills Republicans too, right? Pasting previous answer questions response elsewhere:

----

There two main issues conflating:

1. know
2. knew advised against

So, knew early (and pretty obvious) wearing masks certified fine particulates would filter viruses fell within tolerances.

What know nation-level impact general, low-quality mask use public. data influenza SARS strains said much back Feb March. April rolled around started get data nations vastly different strategies other, became clear COVID-19 responded differently diseases widespread mask use.

This data published starting mid April late April recommendations changing.

This science works.

But knew using N95 masks like going protect individual (to degree, given things need protect yourself). specifically advised people use unless ill, conserve PPE medical professionals, generally right call. Even was, shortages.[Leung 2020]

With perfect hindsight, obviously would done things differently, one knew parameters disease early parts year. even critiques often pointed early new data adopted, [Greenhalgh US Centres Disease Control Prevention originally advised public wearing masks covid-19 pandemic, advice updated 4 April 2020.

There legitimate concerns early approach, published [Cheng Research also done pandemic mass masking compliance high enough effectiveness assessed. absence evidence effectiveness clinical trials mass masking equated evidence ineffectiveness. mechanistic reasons covering mouth reduce respiratory droplet transmission and, indeed, cough etiquette based considerations evidence clinical trials.

But concerns whole standard approach pandemic management, aberant way COVID-19 addressed.

It's wonder Trump triggered snowflakes gets upset science usually proves wrong. Thanks response I'm glad since recovered. high fever? real I've never met anyone think right 110% time.

[This think infamous photo refrigerated truck parked outside Elmhurst Hospital NY reached peak deaths April 1st April 15th. every responsible gun owner small man uses gun feel big. waves gun around, use correct trigger discipline, lock gun safe, even worse: uses chase jogger lynch spot.

Not even fucking close. comes overarching discussion gun ownership US, small irresponsible men hide behind skirts ""responsible gun owner"". saying guns responsibly, shift problem gun ownership itself, ""bad apples"". problem course, many bad apples cause many issues stage perhaps best conclude average person allowed carry death machine them. People, whole, simply cannot trusted them.

I disagree. think people, despite minority stupid jackasses, mostly aright. whenever someone mentions that, ""responsible gun owners"" like come woods carry torch gun ownership general, discussion fizzles problem persists.

No, pretty clearly said people irresponsible give people like bad name. evidenced conversation I‚Äôm currently you: think we‚Äôre like them. problem bad gun ownership large needs society general outweigh rights needs responsible gun owners. 

Essential rights never outweighed. can't recognize that, think ""responsible"" all, frank. hobby worth damage causing. 

It‚Äôs hobby. almost scenario's less lethal weapon (taser, pepper spray, etc) suffice self-defense. 

Neither even close reliable effective comes stopping threat. valid reason gun. 

I disagree. broader sense, civilized society need average citizens carry lethal weaponry. continuing guns perpetuating larger problem, therefore cannot considered ""responsible"" view.

So, view problem. it‚Äôs insane you‚Äôre seeing want believe true. would do, away guns. Stop pretending thing ""responsible owner"", stop part problem become part solution.

Fuck that. part solution. trained many new gun owners responsible. never seen guns unlocked I‚Äôve visited them. zero tolerance policy bad trigger discipline. don‚Äôt understand something doesn‚Äôt mean others cannot.

C: ""gains"" almost certainly include job losses (which almost economists agree would happen), closure small businesses, effect social mobility.

Kid: home schooled.

Other kid: too! high five! Walmart actually really good corona response, least I'm at, pretty much spitting distance HQ. 

They disinfect carts, provide sanitizer entrances exits, first area implement plexiglass shields, first require employees wear masks, numerous measures like one way aisles signs everywhere promote distancing employees going around store disinfecting things like handles freezer doors constantly.

They've also funded hosted free drive virus testing sites (at least) Arkansas Eastern Oklahoma.


Their customers however, totally different story. CCP may shady. honestly, shut major city. america ""oppression"" it, would taken closer look realised going there.

Looking guys outside, looks lot like Government downplaying number infections deaths. 500 people died TB USA last year. man Fauch! Really? fucking tragic. man literary treasure. administration‚Äôs ‚Äúplan‚Äù ignore virus, go back normal, hope blows over.

They want discredit pointing terrible idea. chiropractors real healthcare practitioners anyways. pseudoscience. guess that's line karen thinks scientific evidence.

Meanwhile steps surface infection, including unlikely occurrence someone touching surface recently touched infected person touched face ... person also touch face within certain time. expert every field; truly scholar times Thank posting this. one seems actually want look actual CDC stats, clearly show deaths decreasing weekly basis almost 3 months. Makes wonder could purposely infect mild cold coronavirus make immune. 

Or also people already immune could give plasma help others. Correct Don‚Äôt assume pharma conspiracy charge huge amount vaccine here. collective interest stakeholders get reach many people possible. would also public outrage stated charging something crazy like grand per dose. 

However agree concern equitable distribution be. Ideally disadvantaged, hardest hit communities take first priority vaccine comes instead communities social distancing quality healthcare easier access.

I think collectively need prioritize communities many ethical reasons, self interest terms stopping/slowing spread communities. Georgia resident, go ahead let know high IQs exactly abound here.. lockdown go full Wuhan

Or every person 65 would lose triage pick better stay home

Are mild cases getting treated Florida? It‚Äôs mayor Atlanta called Trump violating local mask mandates. *obviously* problem local mandates. 

Sigh. honestly don‚Äôt understand one. Wearing mask literally downside. 

It‚Äôs like opening schools/restaurants could least economic argument favor so. 

Masks zero impact economy, simply protects people. long run, reducing spread help economy. would hold onto unless really need cash. herd immunity fails work people's antibodies diminish, could go waves couple years.

Family member said: still compassionate whether agree someone‚Äôs beliefs not.


This guy total asshole. wish death anybody. compassion? Nah. already cures several specific cancers, would call breakthroughs. Thing Los Angeles basically close full lockdown way cases still spike, little correlation reopening, surge mostly contributed youths gathering outdoor indoor, protests party. late, no. mean, earlier would saved lot lives, hard lock now, followed decrease ramping contact tracing would certainly help situation today. really fair comparison things considered think pure malice think there's genuine cognitive decline there.

Free-DUMB Nah. mask wearing increasing, vaccines looking really good, spring semester may even business usual we‚Äôre lucky. Yup, people confusing mean here. Prompt reinfection basically impossible (if immune system can't fight die).

Long term reinfection means years, know 6 months, 6 years, 60 years reasonable numbers. think people think 6 month reinfection happening, probably somewhere around 3-10 years viruses ""likely"" reinfection. Since COVID around long, mostly guesses. GORSH! Ugh-uu-guh-huh guhhuhuess see-uh mean! Guh-ORSH! They‚Äôre experts bullshit See /r/COVID19 details, insight T-cell response promising. Immunity fade along antibodies generated neutralize initial infection. 

There's encouraging news, cross-reactivity coronaviruses (common cold) reducing severity conferring level immunity *possible* content published (or least posted) yesterday.

They‚Äôll back. getting harder read these. unnecessary deaths fucking preventable....It's hard get pissed knowing another person went beyond crisis gone. mean that‚Äôs pretty reasonable approach. 

I don‚Äôt particularly strong economics background, least would allow United States hopefully phased economic comeback. path it‚Äôs right potential devastating economic event comparable 2008/2009. Fauci pretends Taiwan exist, spread bad information Chinese government early on, generally checkered history. Trump get along, I'm supposed like now? Fuck that. Yep, exactly. due cell exhaustion, shown happen serious cases. know yet, wait evidence. 

But heard Dr. Griffen get worried, took possibility seriously man right pretty much everything far. everyone gets things wrong hoping wrong time. 

That said, think careful drawing *any* definitive conclusions now. get bit annoyed ""the cells totally save us sure, chance not"" narratives (not you!) push disease moment. *hope* that's true, scientific say (or contrary!) right certainty important consider whole range evidence: positive negative. Exactly. Casual sexual encounters due pandemic.

Makes sense.

Meanwhile many couples acting like end world! make everything political! Welcome Gilead Maybe time make full body condoms? might well stay together, you‚Äôre already infected. profession reason know people try use laws thermodynamics talk diet human weight loss often quoting read blog. 

If field, must know incorrect pop-sci usage. Thanks insult ADHD ramblings that...THING. Don‚Äôt seem hear much France days here
We‚Äôre looking Florida June 27-July 4th. length time started feeling sick day died. underlying conditions. Brazil probably going surpass 2M today too... Nascar well. halted races iRacing weeks too.

Now places opening up, Nascar gradually allowing fans tracks. I've read windows block UVB allows vitamin production need direct sunlight hours sun intense stimulate it. sure light window enough. Like 15 minutes day back yard would suffice think. Except realize Ben Carson rand Paul also doctors. People immoral suddenly become moral taking oath. something like that, lot problems would solved. Fallout3 spoilers:

How feel right know plot trying prevent deadly virus raging amongst wasteland. one intentional, still parallels. !&lt; close friend works third shift hospital Queens. I'm Ohio, contracted virus, sent occasional photo chaotic ER beds upon beds overflowing ICU beyond. texts stopped quite time, recently learned ER virus. two half months, temperature dropped enough able start rehab get back functional state. several masses lungs biopsied every months foreseeable future, texts become less bizarre erratic he's working neurologist, speech therapist, LPC. 

I honestly thought stories bodies freezer trucks outside morgues exaggerated, gave street names intersections located, realized simply tall tales. He's 42, unless count smoker two years late 90's, underlying conditions. also know avoids traffic biking walking everywhere city, prefers subway. point, I've concluded virus much way drug addiction described discriminate, difference know enough determine efficiently prevent aside somehow coming contact all. say thought possible, way eradicate this. 

All need little cooperation. 

And sucks can't get it, chinas way better.

Un-American, better. SARS-COV-2 made lab, wearing mask even important. often eat still lose weight. underweight huge problem people hyperthyroidism.

Once again, eat less burn lose weight. they‚Äôre fatigued, also don‚Äôt expend energy remain overweight. 

YOU'RE RIGHT They're adding deaths May looks falling within 1-2 weeks also. yes, possible delay increase get overwhelmed Dollar General, Dollar Tree, also pretty ubiquitous, requires customers wear masks

source: publish stats definitely 41. We‚Äôre tens thousands now. Roughly 1-2k per day positive cases It‚Äôs strange think head global conspiracy invent virus kill everyone planet become communists.

Those people you‚Äôre talking people believe think they‚Äôre going rationally believe anything say? overreporting underreporting host different issues. best way get general idea look graphs Excess Deaths (from causes) year compared last five years. Unless GA wear masks keep yourselves, idk much issue. would like see cars Texas Arizona plates turned back border tho, tbh. nationwide lockdown would require support federal government. have. would require complete, temporary, overall economy.

It would like WW2 level war time economy. base Trump left ones deep conspiracy theory rabbit hole. cannot back he‚Äôs done he‚Äôs burned bridges. I'm sure agree. easy train give injection. specialized knowledge required. Trump said months ago might mobilize military deliver vaccine DHL, UPS, etc available world delivery logistics solved problem.

It's different every country US, long insurance company reimbursement rate high enough, every hospital doctor's office country could quickly motivated offer daily walk-up injection clinics every day week make buck.

I wonder handled swine flu vaccination? turned dangerous thought still vaccination campaign figuring out. article fox spouting reporting positives, dig like 2,000 cases trying say skewing entire data. America weird country one one hand put man moon. we've long anti science streak especially South. Theses places teaching evloution outlawed late 60s. hatred science going get alot people killed might also muscle average. BMI good measurement cases. 

Former NFL running back Maurice Jones Drew 5'7 like 205 lbs. According BMI, borderline morbidly obese. reality is, seemed like half weight leg muscle. people cannot afford basic human needs, things get ugly. survival instinct. I'm threatening anyone. kids feed. I'm saying, country allow people put situation cannot afford care children, things get ugly. unhealthy reality. Maine zero population density, relatively low risk unless live Portland Bangor certainly welcome! correct need talk doctor issues, *have* TSH T4 tested everything comes hunky dory like mine did, time face reality - got fat ate much move enough.

My HR Fitbit done weight loss anything else. gives pretty darn good estimate energy expenditure day, spits total amount calories eat continue -500 calorie deficit. lightly active days that's around 1600 calories, days I'm cycling four hours straight closer 2500. think underestimate power voter base, totally agree orange mutant turtle, unfortunately base thinks he‚Äôs fantastic job...and much hate say it, I‚Äôll call right he‚Äôll elected Yup! hell them. downside it‚Äôs team sport people idiots affect people aren‚Äôt. go work &amp; home don‚Äôt work public. wear mask cook home. thing though, takes one coworkers throw party vendor come without mask efforts wasted. sucks. Well, know 100 percent wearing mask will, too. Correct again. developed nations managed reduce cases get economies going again.

What's excuse? Well anomaly lying (but I'm giving benefit doubt). 90% people 6'0"" 230 pounds would high blood pressure. Oh shit yeah wife one shift ICU orientation reassigned surge months back. Thankfully prior ICU experience, one year done kind nursing five years. going normal soon. Governor Kemp:
*Laughs anti-science* Mind you, pretty much best case scenario. would far fastest creation new vaccine history.

But it. Humans fantastic pressure benefit modern technology too. Current political situations US aside, right conditions enough funding believe vaccines safe produced quickly. 

We learned much past, fire broken underneath. know humanity pull even faster cooperated. climate change! stopped bickering could fix it. power humanity change climate, think change back.

And absolutely crush virus. just...you know, politics :( Believe me, know _______ anybody. +indicators suggest antibodies last 3-4 months.
Thats potentially quarterly! vaccine boosters.

300mil population * 4, 1.2b needed annually, thats Chinese Foxconn city levels mass production needed. Thank informative answers. Cheers! would expect medical study use accurate measurement like relative fat mass index, RFM still doesn‚Äôt need scale measures waist hips body fat calculator. 

Again BMI created mathematician 19th century. It‚Äôs since eclipsed, studies global accuracy difficult obtain take extra bit time use reliable measurement. Yeah good points, probably wouldn‚Äôt normally socially distant lifestyle begin rushed whole process is, wicked cough back December time attributed cold wouldn‚Äôt go away weeks, haven‚Äôt taken antibody test yet mean don‚Äôt want know wasn‚Äôt could still get ugh...
Here‚Äôs also proof look something you‚Äôll likely find create echo chamber, oh yeah username checks hypocrisy, pure, unadulterated stupidity. They've requiring it. went kohls 2 weeks ago literally everyone wearing mask. Doubtful, lol. Join club. I've sick trying deny ignore inequalities system, unequivocally align along racial lines, lot longer. 2020 still dealing shit. Augh, document everything. Sometimes think remember stuff dates, names, convos etc. get unemployment get fired would guess &amp; could take 30 days personal leave right cares act applies employer. Cases always translate death, proof rest fictional statements. worry, White House cover deaths know real numbers. Also, long distance relationships.

Source: seen weeks Maybe never great thought? liked daily show, much care Colbert Report. make fun republicans. daily show Jon Stewart made fun democrats republicans, way political comedy show be. also 4 imported cases today state quarantine.

After facing berserking wrath people, CDC finally forced change tone.

""Regarding critical global situation, longer expect Thailand free new Covid-19 cases. must limit number,"" Dr Taweesilp said.

PS. protest 18th. much embarrassing US guys mean 'number 1', richest country Earth. Plus people wearing 'make America great again' hats, happening pretty ironic. leader Boris Johnson, went hospitals start shook patients hands... nearly died can't say much. say furlough scheme, testing good anecdotal experience though. I've saying would issue since February (obviously saying ""hey listen me!"" ""this probably end well"" theory). ACE-2 receptor highly expressed testicles. highly expressed organs/regions (heart, lungs, vascular system) shown virus causes heart attacks, respiratory distress, strokes, respectively. wonder might damage - picked yet causing deaths. Thanks anti-maskers. hate combat this, see base small people think. even related Disney yet. early timeline. Certainly good know, also deaths Asia come drastically. Japan. Korea, China, Singapore Hk barely deaths despite dealing recent resurgence. Even lasts 3 months, that's huge improvement nothing. also hope used time prepare.... keep reading articles posts sub teachers saying ""I received communication school district plans start x weeks "".

If districts preparing super awesome remote learning experience, think teachers would training, systems would getting piloted, etc? ....what. complete lack concern care others completely mind-boggling sad corporations take action government will...Jesus look heat map Yakima County‚Äòs cases, highest incidence rate found agricultural areas among migrant workers. Abbot reverse anything. put unenforceable mandate immediately publicly ignored huge chunks state. give credit quarter measures. People deadly disease. 100% mortality kids got stimulus check. 80,000 started decreasing 75 phased out. devolved nations managing virus themselves, Scotland‚Äôs v good job sounds things Depends live. locations require state city law. saying masks required, even local laws mandating them. would say both. personally don‚Äôt know report it. It‚Äôs said take late may, take two weeks cases get severe symptoms, another week pass. 3+ weeks record death. timing checks out. top this, Abbott‚Äôs mouth tv interview last weekend deaths seeing late may. goes completely stance, would want information getting wasn‚Äôt scared future looks like. Cases late may 1k remember correctly. We‚Äôve consistently 10k last couple weeks. 100 deaths day cases 1-2k per day. Simple math says we‚Äôre screwed shoeless

Gotta support hookworms! Wait til flu/pneumonia/brochitis season kicks hospitalizations hospitals full covid.
Its going dark. Yep,I agree. replying comment basically said need passionate advocates science change people's minds, think hostility toward work perfect counter example fuck? probably lot cases admit they're getting desperate. thanks. I'm right, we're going need save every penny have. Half states fuck opening, 

""We follow guidelines everything mysteriously went wrong"" Yeah July 1 appropriate question 60 million cases = approximately 600,000 (6 lakh) deaths... 
It also means lot people permanent damage bodies didnt die permanently disabled.
Not bad all... Sure. One may even view benefit :-). point still stands, masks interfere normal breathing, especially exercising. Masks still must worn reason deny obvious.

Overall, doctor's presentation harm good: anyone worried masks take presentation clear evidence mask proponents liars :-(. stupid. 


We need people wear masks keep distance. best way. simple. need shut down. WEAR MASK. KEEP DISTANCE. Geez. Yeah I'm confused well. hold PhD field I'm really sure people expecting. always possible end point reached super quick - especially US keeps things open tons people get infected.. otherwise waiting game. 67 600 cases.  seen Facebook meme. Fauci's right? man decades experience, well past retirement age, political aspirations. Obviously he's opposing president nefarious reasons not, he's done presidents, health safety American people. Fair, that's good you. I've lost weight, feel like energy suffers significantly work day. this... world* I'm afraid narrative false. 

The 'Boris handled virus badly' narrative definitely fair enough, idea reason went lockdown Boris got ill ridiculous, firstly lockdown already tested, secondly that's running country works. guy work yesterday told us reason every country we're making numbers influence election.

I'm sure arrived conclusion instead obvious truth. calling Nazi, nazi waving party supporter, 

Me: makes analogy WW2

You: call literal nazi point 0rangeMan best China appears tough china fox news fed eyes, reality bends backwards Xi,

Did bend backwards Xi first President modern history launch trade war China? condemning China frequently speeches Joe Biden say peep donors remember Bolton saying begged Xi help re-election?

- That's Bolton put it. wrote Trump ""stressed importance farmers increased Chinese purchases soybeans wheat electoral outcome.""

- liberal hate Bolton calling evil person liar like 20 years, suddenly love Bolton Trump warmongery enough Bolton's taste?

- Trump backed trade war liberals like led liberal media waged constant stream attacks Trump it. forced Trump back fighting China's side Trump United bolton heresay even though heard first hand?

Everyone else present called Bolton liar. 

Bolton irrelevant, though. fact remains Trump willing stand China Biden not. [Biden controlled disastrous US-China policy [taking $21.6 million illegal campaign contributions sharp China accused Washington Wednesday taking Japan‚Äôs side tense clash disputed islands East China Sea... Biden appeared somber subdued... spoke ‚Äúnew model major country cooperation,‚Äù saying U.S.-China relations must hinge trust positive notion other‚Äôs motives.

When look liberals like you, know care China, 1 bit. care defeating Trump cost, including cost means China dominating US. reason people dump talking points China every thread know Reddit mad China, fear Trump strong China might actually influence voters here, makes scared, deep heart know Trump right issue, makes afraid. attacks strokes across nation? C;mon, thats hysterical BS. 

140k people died. Fuck you. Don‚Äôt downplay shit. Florida's latest charts running running 7-day averages deaths. virus rocket launch? set new lows per day reports filtered White House delicate feelings get brushed on?

It's way... ""compliance"" 

Don't ask questions going jerk answer get. [They're blood GOP hands. ^ guy Greeks Families children, especially single parents, going need help. think needs prioritized school reopenings. happens daycares become scarce? give pentagon large corporations way money need, this. I'd rather tax money I'm currently risking life earn go help parents, children, teachers.

Yet, 40% Americans still believe walks water. wonder far far them. that? government failed act. would require ""seventh generation"" kind mentality.

Never forget government actually protects. I‚Äôve 3 lifetime. one guy said eats really healthy, poured giaaaant bowl special k used full cream instead milk  actually know man obese high blood pressure survived Covid. I'm sick 'findings'. government's job protect people. Regardless political affiliation, one primary roles government agree about. Unfortunately, government failed, private sector half-assedly thing. better nothing, course, private sector enforce policies own. (1) cause inconsistencies, companies states. (2) literally government's job protect us (too important say twice).

It seems trying say politically-charged things get response people here. information subreddit, devolve petty politics. social distance forever ever. Yes that‚Äôs exactly I‚Äôm saying brains work‚Äî it‚Äôs easy us imagine bad things happening *others* much difficult imagine things happening *to ourselves.* convince people deal hardship right point can‚Äôt ignore hardship anymore. That‚Äôs hear many stories people ICUs saying ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think could ever happen me.‚Äù they‚Äôre right, didn‚Äôt think could happen that‚Äôs we‚Äôre physiologically wired behave. Hard survive hunter/gatherer you‚Äôre constantly preoccupied mortality. data basing inflammatory opinion? I'm teacher, colleagues spent summer busting asses professional development prepare distance learning fall. It‚Äôs great. won‚Äôt great patients won‚Äôt even bed lie down. People negative countries making situation lot worse be. [In Spain used ice rink improvised Getting rid beliefs others anti-democracy thing do. Straw man term Sure not. sure went head need put /s statements? /r/fitness also probably survive Republican Menace never understand Redditers waiting november. Like fuck? anyone see barreling into? cannot wait november. people need sound alarms. would okay annual coronavirus vaccine. get flu shot every year, that‚Äôs bad. It‚Äôs LOT better online schooling kids. Well, evidence there. submission removed, I‚Äôll rethink it. then, actual evidence? Copying message sent (that contains evidence) evidence. far I‚Äôm concerned thing suppressed intellect. talked Covid waiting /s resurgences lot smaller one US containable since contact trace effectively Measures excess deaths conflate direct effect indirect effects COVID-19 resulting shutdowns reactions virus therefore little help policy-makers seeking make policy choices. Ok Karen. wonder way keep safe(r) enabling job new one within org? feeling robots going make lot big strides longer coronaviruses deadly  I've athlete worked physical jobs majority life. big legs. correct. already know move country; focusing moving another country obtaining citizenship, therefore making immigration plans. Might dumb question, bandanna worn similar ""outlaw"" style (just drooped face) similar mask? want something reusable, since wrap around mouth, sure. Government see people dying want stop preventable deaths? Korea shown temporary lockdown, mask social distancing works. citizens get tired abused government? matter whether Dems Repubs abuse us predatory student loans, taxes everything mismanaged money pay system. using taxes wisely could shutdown 6 months without hurting anyone financially. treat us like 24hour ATM. pharmacies should, I'm gonna say best buy (if already) I'd love see Simon, company owns bunch malls Agreed. live upstate NY. single business know allowed without mask. Sadly bartend it‚Äôs complete madness towards end night, Cuomo announced bars longer allowed offer walk service drinks also people cannot drink without ordering food.

I think NY done damn good job this. Cuomo hardass entire time, pissing lot people strict rules fucking worked. W F E B D.

what ? Unfortunately people understand someone close gets incredibly sick. dad who's among susceptible population refuses wear mask... Political hoax. can't trust government much anything, world would competent enough participate world wide pandemic hoax? main thing time information hand, time, didnt make sense. information came forward stance changed. Almost like scientific process something. I'm sorry feel way encourage try look different perspectives. Labeling something may familiar Democrat/Liberal creates divide purpose propaganda driven sites like OANN. Please seek alternatives best luck. know vote out. left lefty, lefty right move across. lefties need show little righty grab rights. Otherwise Trump re-elected. Yep, latest evidence seems indicate. that's even important wear mask public realized, get exposed either mild case completely asymptomatic...

Unfortunately means also potentially take home give everyone family since people wear mask inside homes. -\_-  team ultimately allowed in. research. Covid gunshot wounds? /s Hong Kong experiences 150 cases, shuts HK Disney.

Florida sees record cases record deaths, opens Disney World. mammalian species get ousted dictatorship. blame one man end day public private sector fucking shit over. People care.

I know people sick guess what! already went Covid 19 going out. basically saying **""I already got go out! Fuck everyone! care!""** 

Apathy real fucked! 

May odds favor! Good luck everyone. I've heard even though Miami supposed ""locked down""

There still alot bars open, beaches packed...shit crazy.

I live north there, idk what's going happen next weeks keep schools open. That‚Äôs question bud, we‚Äôll see Makes sense me. dont believe government right force wear something face.

I chose wear one crowded places, dont believe government able force business nerding hard crime, guilty.

But scientific illiteracy huge problem. That‚Äôs get antivaxxers flat earthers Covid deniers. Better encourage IMO. ""States' rights"" always dog whistle ""white supremacist Christian theocracy shuns reason forbids dissent"" really not, all. God, none attorneys, please stop trying. 

Would google heart surgery videos perform heart surgery? stop acting like understand law google. 

There many reasons wrong.  Days later, June 27, said mom started feel sick. **For two days, said Papadimitriou unable find place get tested COVID-19** 

If magical place. place like backgrounds shown pics. Inaccessible, even healthcare worker. disgrace are. Thats fascism. Complete totalitarianism including revoking citizenships people differing beliefs. Yep. there's major racial disparity welfare make enough money file federal taxes. Good. hope genome gets stopped cold, fucking asshole. thing drug related high point went head. hope available U.S., we‚Äôll easy access it‚Äî especially uninsured.

Hope one hand, shit would work we, nation, worked together.. going do.

There way legally physically enforce country full enough ""patriots"" would outright defy presidential order. 


And would probably need longer 3 weeks, average incubation time. would need average disease lifecycle end contagious period skewed towards longer cycles adding multiplication factor average number people per household assuming lockdown day one person infected. Way longer 3 weeks. Every fucking one fuck right off. government stupid listen corps them, know trouble... ## ARTICLE‚ÄôS CONCLUSION

The study provides evidence states US mandating use face masks public greater decline daily COVID-19 growth rates issuing mandates compared states issue mandates. effects observed conditional existing social distancing measures independent CDC recommendation wear facial covers issued April 3. countries worldwide states begin relax social distancing restrictions considering high likelihood second COVID-19 wave requiring use face masks public might help reducing COVID-19 spread. No, North Korea great. going opening trade travel bubble New Zealand keep cases zero them. guy go fuck himself. Wait....so looters social distancing wearing masks. hoodrat stuff get virus can't procreate. Guess good virus afterall. yes, I've done math don‚Äôt get they‚Äôre trying discredit him?


Because administration. It‚Äôs circus. fire. say welcome mutants invite ticker tape parades. probably realize vaccine found, trump keep hoard supplies. He‚Äôs simply looking people suppose beliefs violate science. Republican beliefs. actually need expunged hope surviving democracy. better worse (worse, IMHO) sheriff's independent elected officials. cannot fired.

State troopers city police hired/appointed, fired. Ultimately, Governor influence sway them. 

IMHO sheriffs exist. 18th century law enforcement, unable function in, meet challenges of, law enforcement 21st century society. bets retailer requires next? Thyroid issues one example. 

There many issues impact weight. people received fecal transplants, without changing diet, began lose weight. 

It‚Äôs thought damaged gut flora wasn‚Äôt properly digesting food, weren‚Äôt extracting nutrients, leading crushing fatigue malnutrition, encouraged body store thinking starving. 

There‚Äôs still much learning human body. Oversimplification rarely helps. Fucking nose chinstrap mask wearers. don‚Äôt get it. posted already front page. Thanks. posting bad faith articles taken context, example ""bad china policy"" coming biden state 2012-2016, however Atlantic article linked allegedly describing bad was, actually dated day announcement would take lead, therefore describe anything 2012-2016, get biased OANN talking points shaded links relevant discussion, claim say discussing good faith?

your entire parrotgraph sad talking points pick cesspool alternate sites, nice try sound legitimate alas swamp leaks ears. probably realize vaccine found, trump keep hoard supplies. He‚Äôs simply looking people suppose  EMT‚Äôs won‚Äôt available, worst hit group NY. Hopefully army medics step  bring back already-bankrupt businesses though. think meant comment economic sense. I'm talking like developing countries extremely distrust healthcare workers, especially foreign countries.

This big problem parts Africa Middle East. Vaccine distribution program already exist, sometimes attacked. Except, can‚Äôt make objectively convincing argument someone care health well-being others someone doesn‚Äôt want to. wild republicans/conservatives first worry economy anything else. However, refuse one thing help country open back vaccine. hypocrisy.

100% correct. careful. Mods sub get mad politics raised..... CDC recommended 1st. hate ""google attorneys"". Kemp duty, he's immune suit official decisions. can't stand people pull masks nose. morons, that's mask works.

I've seen people flat wear around chin. infuriating. man bought econony best level decades, record low unemployment minorities blacks

This flawed argument populists use come power, bring economy, he's riding wave.

Also funny say Biden deranged old fool though Biden probably construct coherent sentences unlike Trump. doubtful? part seems unbelievable you? Yeah... several friends acquaintances local journalism poltics intimated much, terrible thought, I've avoided it. want political genes Mitch die Mitch, like Lonesome George. post gotten previous moderator approval posted. you‚Äôre welfare whole life don‚Äôt file federal income tax, takes longer get stimulus money. thats true..

isnt guy actor, scientist? know it‚Äôs commonplace hate Putin conflate trump etc, someone explain bad thing? know it‚Äôs polite hack someone, shouldn‚Äôt sharing information? think MMR boosters common though, measles causes outbreaks among unvaccinated groups, immunity must long-lasting life-time (besides, levels antibodies tested even rare disease). specific virus, mutate much. freedom *wear* mask, concept! grandma lives there, calls Liberal Alamo. time country, conservatives tend idealize, attack America killed 140,000 people would lead everyone making enormous sacrifices combat enemy. We'd raise taxes across board, especially wealthy. We'd ration food, nylon, fuel clothing. We'd sew holes clothes, rather buy new. We'd tighten belts support war effort. together, everyone would part. go fight likely die country would think accursed, hold manhoods cheap. 

But today's generation thinks heavy burden wear mask keep distance strangers. WW2 generation called Boomers, ""the spoiled brats God's green Earth.""

How every year brings greater sense loss, greater sense shame far we've fallen people, nation? remember Iraq 2003, without armor vehicles, wearing flak jacket without bullet-proof plates, fellow Soldiers dying every day, reading rest country enjoying nice, big tax cut. first time we'd ever raised taxes war. put trillion dollars credit, let future generations pay misadventure oil. thought get disappointing discouraging that. wrong was! That‚Äôs still 10lbs difference without change calories, showing caloric intake important whole story. school system send parents curriculum/activities parents start teaching kids pace. Using titers measure immunity extremely common. 5 sec search gives paper measuring [measles titers.] complicated controversial all. vaccines available early next year, including Imperial College‚Äôs aims vaccinate ‚Äòall billions people World, whatever country‚Äôs GDP‚Äô. Imperial‚Äôs vaccine cheap highly scalable (2 million doses 1 liter) think would one get around world Oxford‚Äôs would develop initial immunity (as cannot use booster dump growing pile lawn. acknowledge surgical mask gaps side what‚Äôs tested here? 
I wear mask everytime go out, I‚Äôm miserable. health issues contribute feeling. bet wore surgical mask gaps side I‚Äôd feel less uncomfortable, too. many states may back full lockdown August 1st. trump supposed first line defence bends Poo Pootine like weak twat. go hide behind loser going rouge? fuck

Trump strong China would like, still least willing stand China. Biden Democrats openly take China's side Trump. liberal media openly waged campaign Trump's trade war. 

You criticize Trump want stronger China, coming you, liberal, bit like Nazi taunting Churchill save France. anti-Nazi, I'm going still support Churchill. someone wants China held accountable, choice support Trump he's literally game town. Case per capita. Ca okay. Florida way ahead race.



http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/?chart=states-normalized&amp;highlight=Arizona&amp;show=us-states&amp;y=both&amp;scale=linear&amp;data=cases-daily-7&amp;data-source=jhu&amp;xaxis=right&amp;extra=Florida#states-normalized Right that‚Äôs ‚Äúcalories, calories out‚Äù. shorthand saying much eat whole story. total number hospitalizations. currently 9,099 hospitalized. fear reinfection dengue fever type infection, first infection provides antibodies, cover points virus uses inject genetic material host cell. antibodies basically tag virus removal, inactivate it.

The second time catch it, much worse poor macrophages consume viruses get infected. cripples immune system. rise proportionately positive cases increase exponentially assuming health system overloaded? wondering, why/how happen? point antibodies then? German virology expert Christian Drosten really hard time even majority country generally supporting Covid-19 measures.

I feel really angry people whod spent time psychologically tormenting experts this. job eloquent media personalities Fauci handling well skill possesses top expertise. 

Sometimes feel like Americans take granted people experts also effectively actors public speakers right demand mistreated like pop idols. Thats signed generously volunteered knowledge. Small uptick think people scared what‚Äôs happening us.

So thanks showing üòâ people wanna grow gills see flood coming way, guess. hopefully misinformation die along way. suppose see course next two months way tide goes. time come officially stop listening politicians. real leaders anymore. 2020- year America went stupid. treatments! antibiotics now, great unless resistance develops. There's also vaccine, apparently foolproof. disease found in/carried prairie dogs animals American West, appeared Madagascar Congo recent years. yes, still there. Fuck real numbers? Quite possibly, know yet. occurred March would've agreed immediately, know lot virus, know ship positive patients elderly homes, better equipped PPE proper use ventilators.

My aim media criticism, agencies/outlets quick report incendiary statistic context. That, along toxic president, compounds public's distrust government media industrial complex. would propose doctors right deny covid care people claiming hoax wearing masks, going covid parties thus getting it. doctor nurse risk life someone's retardness. think real every thing around tells ? Fine show hospital get it. disagreeing, exercise definitely important overall health disease resiliency, bad idea same. He's like Mr.Rogers, can't dislike guy. Another report coming similar conclusions It‚Äôs virtually guaranteed. 

It‚Äôs literal magical thinking think deaths won‚Äôt follow infections. 

We‚Äôre barreling forward bridge ahead. actual fuck take long happen?? hope available U.S., we‚Äôll easy access it‚Äî especially uninsured. seriously hope walk local CVS get like would flu shot. know that‚Äôs long shot first, hope happen early 2021. 2 weeks? Bullshit. could absolutely WAY, WAY sooner gave even single fuck. live small town Texas two police officers showed house week ago rattlesnake yard animal control available. officers wearing masks. Trump's war China really worth Years ago, worked small clothing boutique. One day, guy came in, grabbed armload merchandise rack closest door ran out. manager bolted door him. Chased tackled street.

It worked out, time. shoplifter gun? Virtual learning good option many reasons, including fact parents work pay bills, can't leave kids unattended. nearly effective younger kids

That said, best bad options point love education heroes!*

*unless demand better pay, staffing, unions teeth Unemployment steadily declining though not? confused needs permanent ELSE! mentality. makes feel better, Ohio‚Äôs governor called California addition unholy triumvirate.  FL like twilight zone episode. Half hiding houses, half acting like nothing wrong. deaths starting larger numbers speak, know died today weeks/months.

You know resist shutdown costs, exponential growth continue. hope vaccine. living delivery everything, going grocery occasionally. comes whether enough money work flexibility distance vaccine available, could 8 9 months average guy. suffering psychologically distanced since March.

The vast majority either work, send kids school, go find new job. cannot distance. just...wait happen.

Practically entire older generation glued Murdoch propaganda machine proud admit huge problem, even though know hearts is. makes sadder country. want push away, might die. parents grandparents, need careful. can't admit wrong pandemic president. 

You facing layoffs, loss savings, disease, loss family members once. Moving makes problems worse exposes others process. worst time America life, far. wonder people still arguing giving forged data, opening theater week... *Laughs 21 BMI* storm fake news. Toilet flushes sock laundry cycles 500%! live science believing country takes empires time crumble fall. target months compilance 100% every timme there. buy everything target. I'm sure took corporations long figure people prefer masking, would get business required masks. good piece news could imagined. Anti-body T-cells generated? cool that. 

There's question long immunity might last, given I've heard mass reinfections I'm hopeful even anti-body levels dissaspear months memory identify create appropriate response remains.

Cool. tell twice. last years, desire leave country grown quite bit. happen national scale Got whole planet cronenbourgs morty Huh? Abbot IgG test 100 percent sensitivity less 2 weeks (13 days?) someone hospitalized. 99.9 percent selectivity. Ah, must country founded war criminals Masaryk Bene≈°. one keeps whining 1968 pretending 1918 happen.

You know, I'd honestly prefer concentrate taking worst enemies way westward, regard people, kind acknowledge best neighbors ‚Äî trust me, nothing forgotten. Yes, makes sense basically UBI wage full-time engineer (actually engineers know make less payments). money need paid back future, tax payers. US flat broke interest national debt soon entire defense budget.

We essentially selling future future generations temporarily pump stock market allow people buy non-essential items.

I'm financial aid especially government ordered shutdowns, limited absolutely necessary. corps big enough close Georgia stores protest. would hate see workers hit financially would hell lot better seeing others get covid. think it‚Äôs crazy pets get this, dog get tested many humans still can‚Äôt? That's exactly right. Without strict measures stop spread virus, end sight. continue spread exponentially enough people caught immune. long. recover sadly would make think big deal survived it. Hes right course, odds Donny Dumbass listening pretty much zero, right challenges Donny's demand fast reopening help re-election chances. KY AG too. think use gif Bugs Bunny cutting Florida average 5 times day Fauci's fault red governors major imbeciles ... work lab testing COVID talking boss day this. going try differentiate flu A, flu B, strep A, strep B, add COVID. It‚Äôs going bad. Yes here. Bevin absolute nut. didnt support ACA, can't taken away now. Bevins healthcare plan would killed KYs healthcare systems. don‚Äôt know long immunity natural infection lasts yet that‚Äôs you‚Äôre asking. far optimistic think Florida right thing. Fortunately, Washington's Governor moron, Washington statewide mask order. help. 14-day anniversary latest Washington masking order July 21. Today July 16.

Because this, fully seen effect latest, statewide masking order coming effect yet. course cases still rising. Today's stats always lag behind 2 weeks.

Expect things get worse Washington least July 21. know ""how bad is"" yet today... We'll know bad today (July 16) July 30. see source link, statement disprove fact counts intensive care differs countries. likely information finally wormed way thick skull massive ego. Italy Spain put worst behind two months. Maybe big day US much stupid. Hasn‚Äôt Alaska done distanced learning years? grew rural Michigan distanced learning advanced classes. Can‚Äôt model done before? understand won‚Äôt work all, maybe some.. don‚Äôt live parents paying way since 18. disgusted society. Every aspect it. live police state dictated whims commands strangers. 

I racist. true disgust human race. empathy world sick repulsive. want break. want twisted civilization exists end. truth honesty society fight fend itself. cops. social justice warriors. reality. Again, jurisdiction sovereignty. highschool chess club widely recognized. China delayed movies spring festival release window, largest box office selling window China.

They fire good Dr., because; ""There COVID19 cases! Ask anyone! Tiny Tony know talking about! "" get airborne would infected more, follow would less severe? stupidly seems bottomless. becoming entirely predictable bad decisions made every turn. Sure sounds like reasons go looking... optimally maybe learn long protection may actually last for. rapidly fades may never able get enough people immune quash forever.  know, it‚Äôs hit miss. Chill dude, go get beer something. wish. take lift. catch there. Journalists ones using term ""breakthrough"", scientists Reported publicised deaths. Neither likely true. licking doorknobs strengthen immune systems. great, doubt changing minds ardent deniers despite important passionate advocacy Well that‚Äôs mainly product several decades tribalism US. remember kid, oftentimes bipartisan bills passed, don‚Äôt remember much divide two parties. Liberal friends got along fine conservative friends got along. 

Now though, seems like GOP simply exists disagree point democrats make. probably vice versa degree, conservative family members call ‚Äúdirty fucking liberal‚Äù (even though probably lean slightly right) anytime say something disagree with, even nothing politics. 

Stuff like ‚ÄúI like Chevy, Ford‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat fucking liberal?‚Äù Uhhh what? yeah, AZ definitely seems hitting bottleneck there... hopefully expand soon.. Trump integrity wet noodle.

The dumb cunt. Nobody would wearing masks handled crisis correctly. 

We corona anymore, healthcare sector job well. government supported employers whose profits fell, made easy stay home people suspected rona. top people still disinfect keep distance respect other. trump supposed first line defence bends Poo Pootine like weak twat. go hide behind loser going rouge? fuck work ICU Florida county. 55 ICU patients. 54 beds available last day worked. Remember COVID patients trauma, surgical, misc medical issues. 70 COVID patients ( highest ever growing) twelve vented. panic situation can't continue rate drown area. - like flood caused humans grow gills?

You probably wait generations humans grow actually normal immunity novel pathogens, spine can't throw right neutralising cells plans next summer. LOL - may wrong.... 4 months late yes tons staff still furloughed, reduction permanent positions/hiring. Remember won‚Äôt effective 100% time. 2 billion doses produced believe requires booster 1 billion people vaccinated percentage won‚Äôt work for. Still long ways herd immunity certainly see slowing Rt. Fed issue mandate masks want States it. States want issue mandate counties better others. county identifies problem - state over-rules them?

&amp;#x200B;

Seriously people, fuck wrong w/ Southern Governors? one held criminally liable every death state due inaction public health crisis. I‚Äôve worked offices like that. often edge submitting OSHA complaints always chickened out. Good sticking personal safety. kidding. keep seeing stories people say ""careful"" immediately describing incautious behavior 

People lie time, unconsciously consciously, make feel better probably brags highest score golf, too. Coming hospital near soon... I‚Äôll never forget first time saw tv. like ‚Äúthis cannot real!‚Äù. people think aliens advanced enough travel across universe bothering practice government manipulation achieve goals. Oh that's awesome /s vaccines human trials, based past vaccine research like SARS 2003 MERS, like oxford one, based mers vaccine 5+ years testing. sounds hilarious time good example limitations agent based models, namely goof completely lazily. dire situation EXACTLY can't stop spread. better world able contact health department force boss give colleague 2 weeks time off. Federal government: get it, everything could think make confused chaotic possible, everything going wrong? Ridiculous, push doctors windows steal **our** doctors Like federal stockpile ventilators? Via States report different rates. Currently, 63% U.S. deaths reported within 10 days date death, significant variation many encounters actual Karens wild (at least, Karens actively Karen-ing time encountered them), handful times, three Kohl's. considering go Kohl's maybe twice year, that's pretty interesting... 

This right move, poor employees. get paid enough deal inevitable nonsense. Yea yea bla bla.

You're enough. many lazy fatalistic democrats moronic republicans even dumber non voters.

Enjoy victim safety home behind wall mounted flat screen TV favourite mobile social media app bicker instead getting ass something worthwhile.

Don't risk getting tear gassed change anything second rate democracy, brainwashed impoverished worker class, abysmal worker rights, shitty health care. voter suppression, gerrymandering, dysfunctional political system.

If think get government speak US internal problems, mind. Supposed allies interfer internal problems, good reasons. yes, maybe propose trade sanctions US ruled corrupt assholes. lulz. go work everyday fucking stresful. I'm working overtime help develop tech combat virus seeing people visit theme park Covid hotspot without care world. feeling every day new record while. weeks may headline add zero end Karmavirus strikes again... don't.

I'm considering quitting entirely. (Multiple factors- covid.). whole thing much lost cause, opinion. organization. messy.

There pretty much zero prep going on. contract summer. Hero‚Äôs die, enemies state protest return school. insurance it‚Äôs much. Mine like $300. Without it‚Äôs probably around 500-4k. It‚Äôs whole fuck ton cheaper kid. Take easy. Honestly started running back 5 weeks symptom onset. ran 80km week right lockdown. restarted like 500m running 500m walking first run pace way slower before. don‚Äôt try usual right away. running feels hard yet stray week long brisk walks. first Two weeks running really tried me. Even easy 4k run needed rest two hours recover. far cry hard long runs right got it. kind yourself. typical loop 5k next time loop run half 500m increment take rest walk breaks. Believe me, it‚Äôs embarrassing American government failed thoroughly. exponential growth always come back fast .

Oh well gonna live . It‚Äôs Ebola .  Imagine teacher convince 20 six year olds keep mask school day. believe 'experts' never questioned criticized blindly followed? Actually say that. Almost every epidemiologist I've listened said know. Fauci said immunity could 'variable'.

Which anyone come said people get again, early make definitive decision. 79 days USA hospital? mean bankrupt life now? Holy shit that's promising timeline Africa taking baton South America... could almost understand far away, Korea China, people minimizing threat.

But USA many months, hard find everyday people area gotten virus even died. guy could tweeted people knew met previously person, video chatted them.

The layers denial endless people. Phew. exactly came find out, find trustworthy data now? definition trust data that's first funneled commercial enterprise favored highly political organization. Needs funneled moderately apolitical group least, well-recognized known expert group whose main motivation appears wanting track issue also good.  Teacher here. took two weeks online PD teach virtual school better. homework. we‚Äôre virtual fall, I‚Äôll far prepared March.  Getting rid death curing it.

 would like see Asian cures get rid death. Please link actual studies. Would think cure would bigger news. You‚Äôre overly sensitive.

Nope. 1) article date

2) article even attack apparently sensitive Trump administration supporters

3) contains valid up-to-date news.

4) written me. everything censorship administration commandeers statistics bend public perception reality will. everything overreach Governor Georgia quashes local ordinances like detriment public health. government things. right ones. chance months ago..  Looks like won‚Äôt visiting US anytime foreseeable future. - Canadian person source regarding lack transmission mentioned last part? Would curious read It‚Äôs less virulent. genes haven‚Äôt shifted. article doesn‚Äôt say hospitalizations down. 

The article says fewer hospitalized people dying. could us treating people better (I.e. dexamethazone). could also us hospitalizing larger portion cases. Could lot stuff.

But it‚Äôs reduction virulence. see rest world masked panicked deaths/day approaches zero, could see may feel way *right now*. interesting see criticism Sweden's approach ages. ... already?

Are sick?  See supervisor.  temperature, send home.  temperature, proceed time clock begin meeting quota. tests positive, recovered, cleared tests, felt fine, got ill tested positive. 

Spin like stories getting frequent. makes sense given we're six months this. Realizing ‚Äòhome heart is‚Äô real wake call sometimes. Look CFR good measure...  SWFL, including Collier well. See [Florida Collier hospitals expect reach capacity end month. true, hope evolves hybrid model eventually, choice.

Those choose still youth sports, gym, dance, etc Thank you. definitely help set mask trend. Dunning-Kruger effect gone mad! Let's hope developed, affordable widely available. need billions doses made, majority people need take too. I've read, less 90% get vaccinated, stop spread. ignoring POTUS attempting prevent states submitting data CDC? Pence Trump took week simply wear mask proven work via French South Korean labs? Fauci admitted incorrect earlier stance. I'd mention Fuaci forced phone given possibility Fauci testing positive exists think one overlooked current juncture time.

Methane transparent, odorless gas. cannot sense way. total deaths, 5.593, rounds 6,000 one highest overall per capita death rates world still (though others catching up, tbf).

The disability burden unknown, appears potentially larger expected demonstrated even mild cases cause potentially long term brain lung damage knows else. 

Sweden 'locked down' Nordic neighbors terms strictness NPIs. One striking example many: Danish queen Tivoli early June, Swedish amusement parks need bailout. 

It's contest, neighbors upset arrogantly pursuing reckless strategy puts everyone danger. Victory beans! remember H1N1 set temporary stations around city Canada. Everybody lined spaced apart. like 20+ people giving shots location went to. didnt take long thought Georgia first run stupidest thing done pandemic. fucking true sad time. way earth I‚Äôm sending daughter back school everyone acting foolishly. don‚Äôt love her, do. you‚Äôve known entrepreneurs know don‚Äôt get far broke everyone else nobody wants invest business.

Man wish , weather live sucks there‚Äôs small amazing Cuban restaurant/coffee shops would absolutely brave pandemic go .. best Cuban coffee you‚Äôve ever . There's guarantee vaccine. idiots wont wear mask take vaccine anyway. information people, government nurses Philippines roughly paid around $600 per month. considered high already, private nurses paid half that.

The health care system PH neglected longest time already, that's see LOT nurses going country. goal most* nurses PH get hell PH. I‚Äôm thinking surge ‚Äúdouble-lung pneumonia‚Äù deaths AZ TX recently. daquiri

Mojito What's rush? like people gonna get infected Monday misspelling they've also saying dogs can't get Enforcement becomes issue areas without mask mandates, especially trigger-happy areas. Technically they're private property kick whomever want. Practically though, trying means staff going injured killed. That‚Äôs Americans do. know everything do. Even you‚Äôre internationally renowned expert topic, know Googled it. I‚Äôm sure know type. state income tax. state's main source revenue tourism. womp womp womp probably correct.
If referring people losing antibodies, also ways immune, cells unfortunately, testing capacity constrained moment state &amp; federal health officials need mandating anyone &amp; everyone experiences cold/flu symptoms direct contact someone saying they're displaying symptoms, must quarantine 2 weeks. employers must give paid leave it. way stop spread large-scale testing stopped functioning. every store joins this, Monday's Karening ever epic.  


I'm saying I'm looking forward it, I'm easily entertained. Yeah, sure would nice everyone, [against Fauci's ""going around mask"" starting March 2020. I'm dead ü§£  proposing cast away citizens based beliefs. see issues that, huh? kind point. reopening plans get kids school, protocols someone tests positive. shut whole school, contact trace everyone make get tests. Given takes 5-7 days get results wait test negative start process? Yeah. worst happened Upstate spike Apple processing plant, that‚Äôs control no, need big musical number. call Springtime Hitler! late this? done numbers started increasing Hi. live Florida. I've left house unless strictly necessary since mid March.

However, I'm required office every day, one taking precautions whatsoever. pretty much shut office come unless to. boss (small business) letting customers walk right street care they're wearing masks. attempts made social distance office. coworkers seem care either. boss pretty firmly ""just flu"" camp tell. 

I see lot people wearing masks day day, see many wearing masks going business like normal. drive restaurants way home work see quite cars parking lots. see people walking gas stations stores masks on. There's reason Florida completely fucked.

Oh, wife public school teacher forced back school building next month. put daughter back daycare well. Pretty much, we're fucked there's absolutely nothing unless want lose jobs house. fucking hate this. still remains issue distribution people going pay it, many uninsured underinsured Trump admin actively trying kick people insurance. There's also still plenty uncertainty whether vaccine work extended periods all. That‚Äôs shit flying faces 1000mph Pass company run friends, company sell huge markup, steal supplies again. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* age? compare us neighbors? can't compare us developing country. see conclusion reach point. reason *reverse* mask orders? God America terrifying sounds expensive. Every day Florida breaking records. state like Simone Biles Covid-19. Im curious traditional school even beneficial anymore. 

I thinkkids still need learn course, seriously question whether it, best way tools disposal today. 

The standardization fit anymore imo Virtual learning complete disaster 9yo learning disability. gave last 2 months year.

My 11yo great takes 45 minutes week work gets nothing it.

I support going back person.... virtual learning good option us. article says, good options. assuming lost year 9yo repeat 4th grade 21-22 I'm puzzled. national level strategy seems ""ignore hope goes away"". enough experts around know that's going actually happen...

Doesn't make bigger problem, closer election? Donald Trump: Dunning-est Kruger time. Biden would introduce Dr. Tripod Fauci slap back side. Given think 2 billion doses produced year end, think least 2022 earliest. Production may issue, it‚Äôll administering vaccine logistical problems begin state low population density even compared Florida example. 33rd states believe. pretty sad let things get bad keeping mind. state near rankings many problems. Texas closest 26th.

Generally pandemic easier control low population density regions, see. offense, nurses brightest. mean goes anyone anywhere, among clinical staff always ones go every situation. I've come across many nurses much misinformation research career take step back go information solidifying fact. Otherwise people hypothyroidism wouldn‚Äôt gain weight without meds lose meds despite eating same. 

Hypothyroidism accounts ~10 lbs weight gain/loss. finally worked parents too. going vote Booker, found late people switched parties December 2019 vote primary. geared General.

Yesterday best friend started getting issues us. 6 days hung following influencers? hell wrong you? Look, numbers going going 10x now, people two options.

A) afraid even leave house.

B) pre-actively move relatives another state.

When doubles, hospitals capacity something simple breaking leg effectively kill Florida. take votes but...... United States thinks entitled everything. problems USA want, want one stop attitude problem.

I sledding mountain Switzerland going hill people standing middle path caused crash them. Canadian apologised like "" Alabama"". like, ""I figured states.

But know Canada stupid people too.  Wow, never thought way. That‚Äôs fucking horrible. It‚Äôs totally fucked pushes dystopian hellscape envelope dumpster, isn‚Äôt terrible ‚Äúenjoy state number last.‚Äù That‚Äôs unnecessary hyperbole. need stay vigilant, much suppression WH orchestrate.  Well, since nobody held accountable crimes humanity, guess left USA going Darwinian exercise. wish limited stupid/close-minded people amoral politicians.  Instead, huge portion population put risk, disproportionate share socio-economically disadvantaged bearing brunt Covid-19.

I believed country better this.  Sadly, see clearly naive years. would I. [They also count people multiple negative  

So you‚Äôre tested every two weeks work treatment, counted negatives. article linked says random day looked ~40% negative tests people tested negative least before. yes. am. . robot you. are. so. smart bzzzt...you darn anti-mask people...ugh circuits fried antibodies/immunity last \~3-4 months; possibly, since several reporting re-infection 1st infection Mar/Apr. seems like would start see re-infection reports increase going fall. kidding, pretty amazing read Florida response COVID spectacular. Florida locked nursing homes tight March 15th Cuomo executing elderly state. largely death rate 1/10th NY NJ. current case counts high death rate still much, much lower NY NJ number cases current cases younger people mention issue double triple counting multiple positive results person. appears even cases peaked supposed lag deaths happened. wish media would reports facts fearmonger.

""Sir, sir, retarded medical condition"" 67 lol Depends mean outbreak. mean people testing positive getting sick? kind test it? reliable?

If we're shutting schools every time someone tests positive way ever functioning school covid eradicated could take year, maybe decades lot wrong word: vocal minority. Remember thought Bevin would win landslide? Hmm like 2nd degree murder. willfully knowingly acting fashion kill people, kill people. might hard argue premeditation, reason say first degree. mean mandated want park everyone masks pictures see coming Disney. matter happens ""mask free"" zones take rest workers actually enforcing people walking around grounds.   that‚Äôs true doesn‚Äôt mean vaccine never work? pretty sad entire world would breathe sigh relief Bush suddenly somehow became president again. republican party last year ky done everything drive away them--it worked. people aren‚Äôt concerned are, that‚Äôs it. Pretty simple.

If you‚Äôre concerned enough want spend life locked alone house, you.

Other people want sense normalcy.

It‚Äôs ignorant think everyone going think way are. Fair enough! found one fwiw: KCDC yet release detailed information many tested positive second time symptomatic, key concern public health experts, least reported mild symptoms fever. Authorities yet report cases patients testing positive twice infecting others.

So least symptomatic. fingers crossed multiphasic explanation since reading this: p 187 cases Dr. Griffen others describe, period recovery becoming symptomatic long. know acute diseases long period symptomatic phases. ofc said diseases might exist! 

I glad better! :) already know Florida everything fuck numbers... can‚Äôt help wonder move take roadblock away Republican governors properly juke stats without worry fact checked CDC. Hope good insurance, better dead. Welcome modern Trump GOP Desantis right, florida never going like New York. going worse. I'm far interested one one Moderna. Theres nothing imposing him, he‚Äôs man confident studied lol.

I bet women smell pure sexual energy radiates Doctor. ..... ever flushed toilet? ... believe every particle goes toilet drain ? ? ""This nonsense"" literally reason fighting coronavirus. I'm sure Dr. Fauci still trying play social/cultural game. Dr. Fauci fairly respectable job playing social/cultural wargame honestly, he's infectious disease expert he's fooling (and fooling ourselves) expects he's expert social cultural trends. wrong side curve comes semblance rational attempt fight coronavirus. Maybe time start speaking plainly one respected voices he's going lose respect (like many others) speaking clearly point. people power country anti-science, anti-multiculturalism, anti-environmentalism, anti-socialism proud it. make racist, luddite, corrupt monopolists bent destroying land live in? NO, strong argument either arguments favor get stronger every day. /r/leopardsatemyface That‚Äôs hard pill swallow Cmon USA you‚Äôre slacking. better guys break old records!!! matter time Universal Studios Disney World employees start testing positive. That's way might even start taking seriously. Might late then. Russia says best vaccines. haven‚Äôt given Florida Texas. not? I'm suburbs outside NYC. Life almost normal right now. stores open, limited indoor dining. girlfriend's right getting hair done. Everything done mask. numbers still holding steady.

I look news rest country I'm like HOLY SHIT would make assumptions? there's reason nobody pays medical advice Fauci president That's CFR. mortality rate high many died. could higher counted dead, though, least 1,000 according older report (so maybe now): maybe forgot /s said  one sixties right? Yeah crazy! Maybe A/C changing behavior summer, virus A/C.

I live Thailand, country 65 million people, 90s since March everyone uses A/C time. first country outside China register cases, we've 3000 cases 58 deaths. though we've recently cases people coming country, registered in-country case 52 days.

Nearby Vietnam (95m population), they've 400 cases zero deaths. masks...in countries, close 99% populations wears masks. A/C factor.

Winter generally considered ""flu-season"" US, I'm sure going blessing... Fauci man bought econony 

Just chuckle typo. best level decades, record low unemployment minorities blacks

Prior COVID, unemployment rate dropping stock market rising continuously since however choose attribute someone started job 2017. wonder deranged old fool forgets talking mid sentence scared leave house

I thought going talk two choices, keep describing one?

To honest thrilled Biden either, guys mental illness caps firmly bolted think people view Trump favorably three-plus years insane, stupid ramblings abysmal job done handling pandemic. certainly still fans people tired someone maturity intelligence toddler running country. Biden best upgrade still upgrade.

With really campaigning all, election essentially referendum Trump. 

Good luck.   Mask wash hands keep sanitizing wipes car wipe objects buying 


We get every day excercising shop weekly That'd vice-president who, cut cloth, vastly less popular.

In case, he'll likely survive. Coronavirus pacients tend sudden turn worse 5 10 days first symptoms 9 since declared infected. Boris Johnson, 10 years younger comparatively spectacular health, much quicker become hospitalized Bolsonaro fine.

Plus, there's reasonable chance he's lying infection. [His family last time widely publicised contact disease, spent several days trying dodge showing test results(he ended showing one later, fake name said done privacy reasons). Plus announced infection day one sons gave testimony police regarding alledged corruption scheme lead think might yet another one smokescreens. cartels basically shooting anyone site travel outside borders something like bet hoping Trump would mandate masks basic public health interventions things got bad, realizing that‚Äôs never going happen. coming now? China already said check male infertility back January. wear seatbelt drive? 

I realize that's good analogy seatbelt protects you, mask protecting others. lack mask wearing pure selfishness turned political statement. original comment corona virus... Vitamin 130k lives lost don‚Äôt think anyone deserves props finally getting shit together.

Our federal government, named executive branch, especially deserves credit full criticism *still* suggesting reduce testing.

I believe Trump put something data must go white house instead CDC. means think means testing data useless anyway WH downplay hide actual numbers (aside fact even honest WH one education required interpret data). 

Too little late get credit lives line. Russia cunt country news point. Jimmy Carter entered chat. So, person 'chicken shit' man charge US government vaccine effort given $1 government contract go Federal employee Federal subcontractor avoid disclose financial information, could reveal conflicts interest. definitely chicken shit.  properly public health crisis fucked vaccine could 10x 100x bad health crisis covid. would done ourselves.

So going get right. know fuck talking about. still deserve respect need one day find worthy cause, want there. Every person deserves respect. deserves others pointless childish conversation. sounds peaceful. know died of, frozen. Isn‚Äôt going sort lag effect though say weeks? Obviously treatments better available April still hospitals fill run treatments deaths go work Wal-Mart lol ""associate"" That's correct way Arizona likely two blue senators next election Republicans still wonder McSally lost again. joke... kind would fix it? lol

The people left would people willing wear masks follow social distancing guidelines. politics country would definitely shift towards left almost overnight.

Oh fuck... eugenics?  service workers cannot afford work? putting loved ones risk, without choice stay home. must keep fighting governments impose public health mandates require masks public, lock down, provide economic assistance (as monthly/weekly payments). 

I understand impulse say ""let burn"", we're leaving vulnerable people fall cracks mentality Here's video: ones delayed, sitting hands wake up? ""forgot turn homework"" situation usually. Exercise people! Look folks, even didn‚Äôt get China flu, fuck! looks like sat laid 95% life. ass though. Without pulled pants down. think survey public places including outdoors... Wrong. Republicans fascists think survey public places including outdoors... credible medical associations don‚Äôt amount tin beans. Strangers Candy vulgar extremely clever. epidemic body builders America. Ncaa needs cancel instead leaving conferences Florida already fire someone refusing fake numbers? Think Elon help out? understand lol  You‚Äôre good person yeah know waiting leadership mandate this. obviously never going happen. Well fair, correct: Sweden's situation lot akin undeveloped countries Europe developed countries. [Sweden currently country WHO's list risk countries considered developed listed alongside several developing countries. 

 thought bit unfair compare undeveloped countries developed countries. inisit putting Sweden categorey compare must. currently [doing better Europe's developing countries, worse several Go Sweden? what‚Äôs ridiculous even true, half numbers accurate STILL UNACCEPTABLE. Beliefs grounded science fine. None Republicans‚Äô beliefs pass test. Furthermore, based exploiting women, people color, LGBTW community, among others. Whitehouse needs adopt Google's thinking - ""Dont evil""... fine put different version reality base, completely evil. imagine Whitehouse believes Corona virus exist telling safe sit meetings way verifying it? non biotech people would. way early tried 200-300 people. good news ofc people realize next part extremely high chance working. Right?! may go 12 different tangents least circle wagons end. 

It seems Trump tried ford river instead paying toll lost oxen along way.  private sector acting bitched entire time economy shutdown ‚Äúmuh profits‚Äù you‚Äôre coming right place gov. fucking it‚Äôs mainly trump idiots. you‚Äôre coming wrong place think private sector actually help anything try recoup lost profits. remember reading article online back May interviewee stating older people heath issues ‚Äúuseless eaters‚Äù. upset callousness statement. Two months crisis willing throw deem unworthy wolves. society get level. gonna say got disclaimer... far coherent. No. could refusing check helping them. get close physical take stand. America: ""Hold Eagle"" stayed home, swam, BBQed, drank watched fireworks back patio. huh thought public official doctor scientist right way.

They still oven.

You see obgyn pregnancy.

They born yet. could also rumor. possible never happened all. 

I've heard people swear things happened ""friend"" (e.g. [the ledasha true. think storytelling technique, ""a friend mine"" sounds better ""a friend friend"". lends credibility actually exist. understand general nation wide strike yet. Tens thousands Americans dead actionable outrage. Yes, people might get hurt starve working, alternative turning country North Korea? Where's line? possibly let idiot continue? I'm BAFFLED!

These people well meaning people change mind presented new information. That's anyone trump republican. No. people want this. truly evil. must stop trying appeal humanity, none. Ok goofy. That's I'm saying. people need wonder things. think pre-print study posited months antibodies remain system. sub called maskholes Good researching something believing without question! Wonder could get president learn Rand Paul hailing back April canada btw, imagine 10x population obv crowd bigger... take online classes along high school classes (back 2008) make credits, skipped year ahead foreign country), used company called Primavera Online School. remember pretty decent. fair, However, Fauci also cautioned states reducing social distancing measures quickly, adding must take ‚Äúvery significant precautions.‚Äù

That‚Äôs inconsistent, states didn‚Äôt part well consistently.

That‚Äôs problem gotcha sound bites. remove nuance context. wear crocs fat, liberal piece shit? Sky burial time... forget, *does* know generals. met 6 year old... eat lunch I'm woods hunting deer low temps. course hunting there, good point. Social Darwinism really way run country millions people risk helped amount mask/hand washing/social distancing. situation requires hard lockdown, state financing replace lost incomes keep people housed fed, central management supply chains essential food medical supplies. Capitalism chance respond shit bed. Trump interfering, mechanisms coordinate response already exist within US government. joke 

Says everyone caught horrible anymore. excuse. Especially comes coupled non-apology apology. Well containment comes contact tracing see one would mean time, although, US this, gotta say majority people don‚Äôt give shit anymore they‚Äôre mostly getting paid sit home drink drugs every night don‚Äôt want wear mask. Shit guy work took cross country trip sleep national parks this. People US tired it, let‚Äôs honest, maybe bit suicidal üôå context natural herd immunity, pretty important point. would take two years threshold infections reached, that's time first group start getting reinfected. I‚Äôm Greek I‚Äôm impressed. Would something require getting closer offending maskless person? $10 hour, I'll pass opportunity yelled coughed upon vapid moron looking trouble. There's actually quite lot weight loss subs here! reddit weight loss community awesome went obese BMI 20 reddits help wear mask.  n95 .3 nm weave.  never mind wuhan .12 nm.  Better yet, wear cool cloth mask storing glovebox washed days.   Fauci said work. course originally said would not.  pointing vilification guess. Stay safe &amp; best wishes!! apply states like GA governor prohibited use masks? Can‚Äôt wait videos assholes oakleys getting thrown Kohl‚Äôs Yeah won‚Äôt see numbers. since White House rerouted hospital reports Trump‚Äôs desk instead CDC. justification re-open schools economy look good come November. way able test enough people actually SEE +1mil new cases per day Famous last words comes research national security geopolitical implications. ""a flu strain.""

What college science degree article say went to? Yep, seems legit depends whether county health department tracks information. live, go county's website see many covid patients hospital many deaths had. perfect statistic, track time get idea hospitals better battling covid. Would follow eating low carb would help, carbs thought increase inflammation? Hahaha, spent 2 hrs circling living room yesterday storming Chicago. dogs' quality live significantly improved get daily walks. graphed morality rate compared US, looks long? Covid19 April, relatively mild case still battling ""mild"" symptoms. Fatigue, blood clots, high blood pressure, swelling numbness feet toes, mild shortness breath talk, plain tired feeling sick. almost fine weeks gradually getting worse time. many people survive like me? ""fine""? No, bees Kids sick need send home, point. test? test that's offered city. care false positives, would care false negatives. positive waiting test, stay home.

I expect many sick days kids, better many kids sick.

Cohorting best things. many kids get sick one cohort, close cohort, avoid closing full school.

Where good chance vaccine next year, so, people slow life adapt inconveniences year so? not?

What good vaccine next Spring? consider people died disable many people either inpatient bothered bit inconveniences. boggles mind. additional assumption even ambulances available get there... think still won‚Äôt hit home unless it‚Äôs loved one never able burry themselves, never able visit pay respect fact.... Mine free Eating shit thanking 
I keep coming back this: considering risks associated initial infection flawed looking impact virus.

There initial illness many HIV infection, danger lies. It‚Äôs long term impact dangerous. virus, beginning get hints longer term health impacts be. 

But short term framework actively pushed right get schools back open. (‚ÄúOnly 13,000 school children die! rest fiiiine!‚Äù-paraphrasing FB discussions morning) I‚Äôm Arizona , it‚Äôs winter (everyone stays inside ) come fall you‚Äôre going trouble . way national security decisions made, likely every country every country developing vaccines. 

If geopolitical foe vaccine, chose share it, would mean paradigm shifting edge military immune. virus could weaponized, sense immune population could safely work within infected communities enhance spread. COVID arguably consequential military asset planet aside nuclear weapons. Nations want certain playing catch-up vaccine.

If West vaccinate support Ukraine, Russia would unable fight protracted ground war western border. afraid of. Canada many jurisdictions passed indoor-mask bylaws came force last week. Yesterday worker enforcing store policy, 73-year old became irate assaulted worker fleeing car police called. Police met home altercation happened senior shot died injuries. pistol semi-automatic rifle ""recovered"" though clear brandished directly led deadly force.

Police shooting senior seems kinds wrong, least offender ultimately lost rather Good Job! lost 14, achieved goal get BMI 40, find anywhere good enough. really want go back old days worry money balance alone time / quality time family. could sped ethically dubious route purposefully infecting people.

I wonder sent people bit ‚Äúgo live up!‚Äù encouragement gift cards certain bars dine-in restaurants something. Stats showing minority deaths think good shut down, increase bit peak 12 16 days later centered within 10 day plateau. (I base NY NJ data late march early april) That's well within timeframe passing NY, momentum carry California line rather quickly. plateau California right 10,000 new cases day rest July pass NY 8 days. assume Florida doubling every 13.5 days current exponential rate, then... well, wow... im surprised, would actually it. Florida would beat California half day. add maybe hidden ""walt disney world effect"" kicking next week man, Florida might pass 2 days early.

I stand corrected. California favorite, using worldometers data, Florida multiple avenues victory. Wonder Fox News covering stories? everyone positive since around 5G /s confirmed. Bill gates created covid 5g could cure 5g profit! Olde English Fireball stocks see nice bump. shots! shots! shots! shots! shots! shots! shots! shots! shots! shots! perfect killing machine Plutonium created lab. Send some, please. one thing America excels at... using media create enemies 

not worry follow article week, equivalent fifth page newspaper somewhere internet, claiming info confirmed and/or speculative.

Honestly, I've followed beginning every step along way seen unbridled optimism, down-playing, calling people wear rosy glasses ""doomers."" So, even remotely surprised end saying catch every six months. coming someone remembers human-human established yet. fuck shit rhetoric. days, ppl get declared heroes suffered died something ultimately responsibility someone else.

That joke. excellent interviews balanced persona earnest questions. I'm worried fiance. He's chonker, he's chonker apparently restaurant workers essential days, oh employer already tried hiding active COVID employees unit


Fuck thought required too. I'm talking local requirements nationwide target specific policy. 

Maybe got rolledback point maybe something imagined. Maybe workers? Idk. one taking Russia seriously america eu? eu, even much money, send cloth mask. also sub. Masks4all maybe worth visit. I'm sad. Wish y'all good fucking luck there. right now, plans follow interview, maybe enough questions could follow-up video call interview sometime future. 

I decided interview want bring information perspectives people may get lot watching mainstream media. convenient sister doctor willing share experiences, especially internet.

And yeah, really weird think world know may never go back knew... heard CNN day expect dealing untill summer 2022... 

Anyway, I'm glad enjoyed it! Way much money power involved. Whatever country first effective vaccine going get major boost it. wonder he'll still tough one employees winds hospital catching virus? money sudden tragically late epiphany wrong. Cases rise CO. People need stay home. aimed addressing way media institutions address science whole. Quote paper, note disagreements, tell people strong correlation is. sexy, loads open people's eyes goes behind curtain. even saying? word soup nonsense. individual‚Äôs right self defense portend end superpower status? 

If anything, demanding ‚Äústrict exhaustive counseling session interview map thought patterns individual wanting‚Äù *power* convincing loons like give even power disarming people. means it‚Äôs politicians worried it‚Äôs decisions actually guide status nation. I'd say ""fewer,"" ""less,"" covid surge, suppose things like beds ventilators get shared, become non count nouns. always count America right thing... they've exhausted options Holy shit think aneurysm attempting read this, hey watch this. I'll make speach good better using predictive phone text. 

I'm going able find time get done office said take 30 hours day good greater fields work us happen take back least get together good night I'll 7 today raining I'll there. 

There go trump quality speech predictive text. better Android phone president. I‚Äôm talking *this* vaccine. I‚Äôm sure vaccine hit market pretty soon (most likely soon). natural course disease vast majority mild disease, safety data pretty interesting. They're going unable finesse way around school reopenings.

Republican governors win situation front them. reopen, virus going spread like mad every school age parent freak really starts rolling. break White House reopen undermines Trump angers base. It‚Äôs sad argument. Like even 80 year old died, person dead today wasn‚Äôt supposed dead.

And yea, sub gets pretty toxic weird comments upvoted. Earlier week breaking point trying shut conspiracy theory got downvoted. saying government actively letting virus go order kill black people. trying explain would political net negative. Also disservice problems systematic racism say it‚Äôs evil old white people ruling world. actuality we‚Äôre culpable system set makes minorities get worse medical care. It‚Äôs common saying public health ‚Äúwhen America sneezes, blacks catch cold‚Äù. sub place get real information

Oh saw /s knew wasn‚Äôt argument. comment argument whole. worked really hard get BMI 40 (which previously listed threshhold increase mortality, find enough. mention blood type study really screwed me. smoke diabetes, high blood pressure. cholesterol crap though.

I'm freaking one husband's employees hospitalized presumptive covid. I've left house 5 times past 4 months. enough trailers , it‚Äôs Ebola . Scum earth people take vitamin ""Buh itzzzzz muhh raitzz buy groceries bruhhhh! Even mask!!!"" know people died first infection. Probably sold robocallers moment. *Donny, either share research us releasing pee pee tape*

That's Putin needed tell Trump. bother hacking? exact opposite flattening curve (remember that? feels like talking concept decade ago). US may well get time many countries, going total collapse healthcare system get there. They're couple weeks away becoming real possibility. go fuck tree. Yes, point stands: cancer paitnets getting care would normally get due burden Sweden's care system. difficult ‚Äúdamned do, damned don‚Äôt‚Äù situation patients world in. 

Sure, neighboring countries. read great overview Finland's Test, Trace, Isolate strategy [they mention healthcare back normal mostly Denmark too. Sweden. They're discussing queues 200k long: simply contradicting Swedish medical journal's article say: capacity diagnose illness throughout pandemic.

Or saying there's capacity used? cancer know well suffering waiting treatment, don‚Äôt presume don‚Äôt care that.

Then would deny happening? someone lives country, assure nothing South African government says believed. care looking good good. go YouTube SA parliament see trust worthy poor country is. Well covid-19 name virus, potentially mutated strain could call covid-20/21/22 on. 

It means ‚Äúthe disease caused coronavirus 2019‚Äù I'm professional anything, would say something better nothing, something leaves open end breath escape without passing material probably great protection. 


If want make makeshift mask, looks like places like Old Navy Target starting carry reusable masks (also multipacks) affordable price. mean ""run out?""

No one said anything running out. need hit threshold infections people monitoring. general population. Right? I‚Äôve reported office OSHA far crickets. sucks assistant manager trying get violate states executive order making send someone individual‚Äôs home nurse COVID patients. like won‚Äôt it‚Äôs illegal she‚Äôs trying tell anyway! go away gets warm Add social distancing masks list. keeps flipping talking points. supposed criticize him??!? There's one bit article.

""Earlier month, health officials Cass County announced cluster cases linked party attended hundreds. least five cases confirmed teen helped promote event said least 10 experienced symptoms.""

So...yeah... Blocked travelling countries. don‚Äôt need challenge trial. virus prevalent enough many places. Intentionally infecting people still unknown virus highly unethical. Obviously work everywhere, cases could:

Test everyone sending boarding school. Everyone lives together campus regularly leave, anyone come (or return), get tested, covers oddball needed repairs facilities. Yes still, wear mask day, n95 masks processed reused, give us limited amounts those. masks supposed disposed every time leave patient's room. course there's enough. company‚Äôs done start protection employees. Glad see though better late never. supposed trust local data news outlets covid data? I'm trying convince wife middle name child Covidia go it. Maybe would stop flipping whatever said 3months ago criticism bad. special group morons go extreme lengths potentially harm others also understand knowledge brand-new disease, especially one complex COVID-19, evolves time goes on? updated recommendations necessarily mean people previously lying? (most importantly) even indeed lying, would *still* beneficial wear mask now, encourage others wear theirs, instead focusing pointing (assumed real) lies? talk wrong matter virus. need protect people, masks big part that. Calling CDC etc. ""liars"" gives fuel somebody part solution doesn‚Äôt mean aren‚Äôt also part problem.

(Assuming wear mask talking lying: statement goes you, too.) rebuttal. Also, paper linked calculations based assumptions jobs kept (which 90+% economists disagree with). Maybe.

I read whole thing thought ""at least, stay scientific domain, making political debate"", noticing filed it...


Wouldn't change much, though: simply listening science become political issue...


We're fucked, up, sideways... said masks dont work? Fauci said dont need them. Back February... issue US yet. Dumb shit republicans piss moan left ""taking context"" asked it, extreme... maybe going hold accountable start actually said... also take consideration experts information moment. judge experts hindsight wont experts anymore dipshit... want?  kinda person needs ""a 60% chance rain"" explained think weather man wrong didnt rain...

people still estimate piss poor lockdown helped save hundreds thousands lives. come from, test positive go quarantine two weeks. want scared headline context! 
They honestly include auto summary bot kinds articles. overwhelming evidence mask usage. Fauci said 3 months ago change that? anyone wearing mask willfully ignorant point? What's happening USA? thought people wearing masks all? come many new cases every day Lots side effects well though according actual study. Mostly mild really know next phase complete.

Your slogan ""Make America well again"". Yea, no. 

Sorry sorry. Fauci like weatherman , wrong 80% time &amp; correct 20% effective, please buy right now. Medical proffesionals NEED masks.

You know DAMN WELL Americans would gone bought masks. Theres doubt it. Selfishness knows bounds knew that. talk day ""undermining public trust"" fact July 2020 anyone wearing mask public willfully ignorant. doesnt matter Fauci sid three months ago. marketing.

If virus drop/aerosol lands mask, deactivation makes little difference point. american here, mask wearing area number people wearing hats....in church. negligence anymore. ill intent show one power.

This kind stuff like NJ bridge scandal time lives line.

Ya, President United States promote line canned beans. great thing free is, justify exercising it. government shouldn‚Äôt mandate masks. It‚Äôs overreach opinion. think everyone wear masks. Unfortunately Americans stupid play ball. Well would nice videos see ppl walking stores without masks seem get penalized all.

I often feel like wrong ppl get punished many gets away w things.  

Like videos refusing wear mask going stores despite told no. like worker would get trouble push back. Reminds schools defending gets trouble. really need epidemiologist explain problem? surgeons fainting surgery stop pulling mask chin they've passed guy door, trust me. know hockey players Canadians right? Yeah, read one them. Sure kid. Oxford vaccine going manufactured non-profit. Formula 1 shown works without thus many people.. ""Late Monday, Woolery apparently shared less combative message Twitter saying, ‚ÄúTo clarify add perspective, Covid-19 real here. son tested positive virus, feel suffering especially lost loved ones.‚Äù""

that would chuck woolery started testing 10,000 people UK infection rate went low get data needed. They're testing Brazil South Africa, there's lot infection. Fauci support HCQ+Zn offer free N95 masks lab tech fitting problem solved. Seems simple me. read whole study.

But people shouldn‚Äôt opinion topic know don‚Äôt understand. there‚Äôs idiots people understand... anything... sub, it‚Äôs usually idiotic, misinformed posts rise top support misinformed hive mind sub. 

And mods allow it. 

I don‚Äôt understand every social media platform world pressured clamp covid misinformation, yet sub allowed exist freely spread misinformation without anyone stepping in. favorite thing read trump early pandemic Trump saying doctors impressed well spoke medical stuff, could've doctor wanted to. One rare things president made whole-heartedly laugh without crying. hasn‚Äôt ass charged Bioterrorism??? population centres Canada every bit dense LA County. We're basically Metro Vancouver + Quebec - Windsor corridor, sparsely populated space between. mean fair people thank god surgeon's work makes sense. Betsy DeVos can't even coherently speak public schools, would shit teachers got together. problem 90% teachers' unions teachers used getting fucked grow accept it, hard appeal angry side teachers: part job, us put aside. Places like South somehow legal fire someone labor related strike would actually realize fire everyone, precious economy goes them, teachers absolutely power numbers actually something this. 

They though. 

Source: I'm public school teacher 12 years active union member officer - wearing mask would violate freedom constitution say people believe wearing seat belts save lives. could told people wear shirt masks like ended April anyway. could honest said need save masks medical personnel.

Instead chose dishonest undermined public trust. intelligent move contributed failures later on. made mistake. Fauci part task force, arguably important member. Much blame certainly rightly lies him. thinking whether mask producers going buy license mask mass produce it? feel like hopelessness talk hear often gets ppl even try anymore overwhelmed.

I think talk done. 

I'm still new this, started look ways find info politicians. rather overwhelming taking bit time. Politicizing virus again. Atlanta, Augusta, Savannah mayors Democrats, took strong stance precautions. Governor Republican, flexing muscles. Also people stay Florida. know multiple people Indiana went trips recently blows mind. 5500 Sweden's residents 140.000 US residents say matter, never will. many thousands, millions maybe, countries equal worse case loads still alive thank whatever policy implemented kept alive voice.

Take death rates UK, Belgium, Italy, Spain, apply world population tell scary statistic acceptable risk ""Leaders"" taking.

The speculation 2nd wave deadlier that, speculation. SARS-COV19 vanishes face earth September less morbid speculation. 

Simply, better dead today speculate eventually die December? 

Sweden's isolated autonomous economy survive centuries. return caves burning left forests broiling chipmonks fish. Coronavirus: No, keep arguing among yourselves... Looking graphs see similarity 2 countries. went weird direction, one obviously positive results it. basically still killing denying it. two replies one comment, lol snowflake indeed. Gone soon, missed Also areas first wave hit harder delayed reopening couple weeks,that explain cities like Madrid serious outbreaks YET stonk market go up! Buy stonks people, economy great USA open business! ‚ÄúThen ain‚Äôt black!‚Äù  punishment, safety guideline. There's always general assumption multiple missed cases every confirmed once. UK testing poor rule thumb seemed assume ten one ratio missed confirmed cases. I'm sure assumption adjusted weeks since. I'd surprised less five one ratio US right now. It‚Äôs correlated lowering rates religion too, typically religions push baby making useful needed people fight wars etc. Let Putin go first then... PA resident I‚Äôm glad governor listens science takes initiative. Lord knows we‚Äôd big trouble party governor‚Äôs mansion right now. ""it's different!"" said least 2-3 weeks....could more. Lots unknowns....

My point death increases seeing know roughly correlate case counts 4 weeks ago, map low point cases low point deaths looking 7 day moving average. 

5 weeks ago today, June 11th, 23,940 cases. 4 weeks ago, June 18th, 27,694 cases. We‚Äôll likely near 70,000 today hitting max testing capacity states highest totals.

Most likely scenario rise deaths August, plateau 1500-2000 deaths day due bottoms soft lockdown. send significant numbers kids back school September get another bump up. weather cools way things get better October November. real hope improvement unless get partial herd, vaccines, new administration 1Q 2021 earliest. Total disaster. mom seen hundreds corpses. Stop!!! sides!!!! Omg that‚Äôs incredibly sad. considered recovered bam.
And won‚Äôt counted toll bet. wonder many others.
Her poor family. there's not. Let's see proof. Post peer reviewed study claims masks work. Provide anything Dennis Rancourt (who know like push - he's even medical professional. Yeah.

Only stupid people travel moment

With hindsight, New Zealand got right. closed borders March, forbade citizens travel abroad, make returning New Zealanders quarantine 14 days tested let out. They're refusing re-open borders foreigners.

Life gone back normal New Zealand, they're even wearing masks. They've sacrificed tourism industry achieve it.

Countries like Spain, tried rescue tourism may end worst worlds, disease come back lock destroying tourism permanently. Good ol Bristol Tennessee. Serisouly though place packed. oh phew grandayy save online troll herds defending failed herd immunity approach definitely similar... meanwhile US 70.000 cases back 1k dead day again. 

I assume he's mentally challenged...doesn't seem enough brain-cells psychopathy. March, report created presented model said action taken, US could see many 2.2 million deaths. lie. Claiming report said surely 2.2 million deaths lie though.

It's case nobody knows the're doing, anyone knows exactly what's right. Science lets us quantify stakes also hear Fauci White House constantly odds. that‚Äôs case, doesn‚Äôt resign?

He'll never resign, definitely resign he's odds Fauci scientist. I'm even sure he'll freely leave white house case loses elections. running tally shows different regions imported cases coming from? so, could u please tell us daily updates. Thanks, really leaning anti-science beliefs. know going wipe voting base? Elderly people lower cognitive ability. moved south ‚Äî surprised (not surprised?) hear one new neighbors bragging fact never worn mask ""COVID like cold teenagers."" Deactivates?  Seems like odd word choice. Yeah, but... but... Trumps trade advisor says he's awful Jared agrees! he'd wearing BLM t-shirt, nobody would said anything. Poor guy 20% teachers could retire quit schools open back up. kids really going get good education There‚Äôs lot wrong post. I‚Äôm little confused husband could ICU physician still idea you‚Äôre talking about?

First all, tests got COVID generally 70% accurate. don‚Äôt know you, consider 30% false negative rate still fairly large. I‚Äôve seen people hospital test negative 2-3 times testing positive. negative before, false negatives? Who‚Äôs say.

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs significant population thinks virus isn‚Äôt real, think that‚Äôs largely fake narrative. think people think dishonest spins it. example: people claim masks work still release tens thousands prison? People claim it‚Äôs random people restaurant eating mask causing increase cases riots protests people wearing masks gathering large congested groups? Etc.

As far risk goes, average age mortality 80 people little symptoms. what‚Äôs idea ‚Äúthat bad‚Äù? that‚Äôs subjective relative. think current mortality around 0.28% depending area demographic. That's joke champ  completely delusional talents, trump thinks he's genius, sub 80 IQ, linguistic skills 8 year old. Here's sign.  UK run tyrannical government complicit many war crimes across world, poisoned Russian citizens Yulia Segrei Skripal denied access independent journalists individuals (even going far prohibit contacting close relatives), blamed whole thing Russia even though one two victims essentially shredded whole narrative controlled interview military base.

Now, disgrace govt wants use another crisis blame Russia. ***""Russia stealing SECRET CORONAVIRUS RESEARCH!!!""*** cry puppets Scotland Yard, except time seem forgotten vaccine sort top-secret military research, something someone ""steal"" first place. I‚Äôd like know percentage COVID positive kids develop lung damage. lungs pretty good resolving damage, still don‚Äôt know long takes severe damage cause permanent damage. states governors passing rules prohibit mayors city officials mandating masks. insane. caused religion, specifically Christianity. Eventually come crossroad know something isn‚Äôt adding need decide science god wrong. Im server people refuse wear masks eating/drinking table. life worth happy hour specials. I'm glad first response got someone calling white bigot moron. 

This fresh feel. git study puts long lasting damage 25%-30%?

Because numbers basically non-existsnt I've seen.  Larger amounts death? CDC said 0.65%?  one thing Trump administration done right (we probably talk dismantle it) [Warp Essentially we're paying companies ramp production capacity now, hopefully start producing vaccines they're final stages approval, eating cost work out. ideally vaccine approved widely available. worth noting I'm pretty sure threshold vaccine approved right 50% effectiveness, current rate spread indicative, probably actually stop virus, especially drop masks distancing soon vaccine comes out. natural spread rate, especially winter seems high. truly believe global conspiracy get everyone wear masks? seriously? ‚ÄúIt used people want see cleaning people office... Now,‚Äù adds, ‚Äúpeople want seen more.‚Äù Imagine intellectually numb that, even presented objective, unbiased evidence, still refuse even entertain idea changing stance something ... fall upon deaf ears! might covid higher chance cause them, feel like likely covid super contagious, widespread children. basically invisible it, probably running rampant NY lockdown order came Admittedly, privilege withdraw kids school exclusively homeschool since worked home pandemic. Many families don‚Äôt ability go state‚Äôs virtual option also requires heavy parent involvement/guidance per day. good choice EXCEPT mandating masks statewide. It‚Äôs literal least keep kids, families, school employees administrators, teachers safe. he‚Äôs refusing it. That‚Äôs pretty clear message send. He's far dumber Trump, Trump aced cognitive exam well doctors shocked.  Money says super xanax turns zen Well I'm hoping get herd immunity hinges vaccine creating lasting antibodies cells creating immunity.
Here's potential problems we're seeing. antibodies last two months vaccine (which length time last get Covid), everyone needs get vaccine within time frame everyone develops antibodies roughly length time.  
All takes one asymptomatic anti vaxxer blow plan water. would prefer added list considerations discussing pursueing herd immunity ..... long possibility certainly real I‚Äôm still wearing mask he‚Äôs probably slightly believable politicians lied us whole life‚Äôs. usually westerners know nothing anything outside west waiting kind tie-in Fauci come. would thought hospitals run covid tests. would hospital D.C. letter stating stats go D.C sent back march scary Part concern originally hoarders buying huge amounts PPE materials. original advise try prevent Public buying ‚Äúthen‚Äù limited supply, preventing Hospital staff access it. Public supposed sheltering place, gathering together groups would require PPE.

I STILL can‚Äôt buy Clorox Lysol wipes Grocery Stores Amazon.

Image Hospitals able protect staff caring COVID-19 patients. Little mistake make pointless. 

No, every little mistake dosent make masks pointless.


That's like saying seatbelts pointless kid took 10 seconds change seats. busses them. ""Mild obesity"" like ""a little pregnant."" point, can't sugarcoat things anymore. We‚Äôve probably 1k weeks pretty criminal underreporting LeAsT BeLiEvE *SoMtHiNg* gOdLeSs InTeLeCtUaLs bRiNgInG gOdS wRaTh. really insane. much stuff wrong bad short clip, like wtf. seen good role model?

Oh know, thought saying ""bro bro-ette,"" get idea. Still fit Karen stereotype. Okay. atleast case Italy, everyone dying **with** virus counted dying **due to** virus leads overinflated numbers. *However*, difference corona deaths excess deaths indicative much larger deflation, due missed cases. want Christmas BSL-4 Hazmat suit Covid-20:21 Even we've got handle rona, make permanent? Wal-Mart nasty. What's point this? 

Private businesses still require correct?

I thought smaller government, let cities/ counties decide best people, make one blanket ban entire state. Straw man. Trump playing parents really care third schoolchildren Florida C19-positive. 

They choice, like corporatists, want FREE babysitters. Something ""news"" source trying sell books suspect. state getting info place CDC was, database hospitals entering information into. 

curious states override add dual reporting requirement themselves. Trump plan, pretend. many 173 million people 13 countries downloaded Indian government's COVID-19 contact tracing app¬†since March 2020.¬† Bragging sense smell COVID....power move. report shit let mod handle it. EU tiny fraction covid positive cases US has. comparable EU. Louisiana gooch also helped Bob Marley, homegrown comedian, done Facebook videos ""Krona Watch 2020"" throughout pandemic. catch Facebook like weird Maine humor. know wearing masks respiratory disease new. Considering countries every flu season. 

He irresponsible entertaining compromising whatever want call Trump beginning. 

His actions fed people doubting seriousness this. last two weeks, new cases coronavirus reported West Ostrobothnia Hospital District, traced back people making shopping trips Sweden.  natural selection point. ""Karen"" meme histrionic self centered soccer moms demand speak manager berating minimum wage employee refusing accept coupon expired three months ago. types hold line demand ""satisfaction"" totally wrong. get way ""make scene"" get way. I‚Äôd probably put 25%, 30% max. that‚Äôs still high enough keep us COVID mess long time.

Also, beyond percentage resist guidance political reasons, suspect also sizable chunk simply due lack self control. target younger crowd, think especially likely give temptation go bars, parties, etc. even know better. level, even understand it. They‚Äôre stage lives they‚Äôve become independent suddenly lock down, mention perception invincibility comes youth. That‚Äôs defense, simply recognizing many us reckless things youth despite knowing better. happened draw short straw reach point lives pandemic. author medical doctor, clinic Arizona treats cancer using ""natropathic medicine"" Huber Naturopathic Medical Doctor Tempe, Arizona. clinic, NatureWorksBest Cancer Clinic, reported results detailed documentation every patient stayed least two weeks clinic, 2006 revived cease desist letter discussing Bezos hoard money.

He rich vast majority ""wealth"" stock owns Amazon. billion dollars lying around, owns billion Amazon stock.

Keeping control company built ""hoarding"" money cops wear masks, think they're gonna give fines. even NYC we're actually better lot places cops seem wear masks. kinda would like close borders states make people quarantine wanted come in. really lot roads. Fauci never politicize he. vocal recent weeks need wear masks slow stop reopening things. people can‚Äôt reconcile party‚Äôs stance either disavow party science. starts talking negatively Republicans drives ‚ÄúDeep State‚Äù nonsense brains. Silly always thought good ask Patient Involvement

Quality health care team effort. play important role. One best ways communicate doctor health care team asking questions. time limited medical appointments, feel less rushed prepare questions appointment. Oh man, feel sorry normal people there; nuts. gotta show friends, like. dunno explain it. 

This basically make jokes USA never really actually assumed would actually happen. 

If makes sense. Trump half brain Fauci charge pandemic response beginning tool Pence. went well, could claim leadership day, would scapegoat. 

But sadly Trump seems think lie everything try make lies reality like everything , that‚Äôs crazy. Also VA, district hasn‚Äôt made plan yet. would make sense fully remote, think they‚Äôre trying allow students campus. I‚Äôm terrified. He‚Äôs got BDE though. Hopefully individual states make information available databases internet, well possibly local newspapers kline'd :( Terrifying numbers. 

I can‚Äôt get states barreling it. Someone else said that, wast it? Oh...yeah....Dr. Fauci! 1% increase 1.5% increase compared last year. Surprisingly enough, that's actually proportion students year six receive approved semester grade subjects decreased 0.7 percentage points previous academic year. 

Oh come on, Sweden! *so* close good news. alas, goes show thoroughly Swedish strategy failed. Sigh. bet Nordic countries, sensibly closed schools, much better this. Yeah, do. I'm lucky work home indefinitely. I'm ""sucking up."" stay in, see friends family. lot like me, too.

Back March, calling emailing late local businesses send people home could. call representative, people's representatives, immovables Senate, multiple times per week. Others same. They're open schools, Christ's sake. horrific experience I've lived I've seen shit. 

But feel though we've done nothing. I've done nothing. can't go topple buildings, yell White House person want catch/spread thing. want make body bags freezer trucks them.

So stay home. 

We really lockdown. Anyone claims did, know word really means. free leave houses pleased, workout penalty. said, even tiny effort help us get cases deaths down. continuing shit like open bars despite evidence kinda shit makes worse--didn't help. 

We lot people care lot still social distancing. also lot fucking morons think mask equals C word I'm sure say (I guess Chinese Government well do), they're gonna go wherever want. also people otherwise good intentions ""over it"" go meet groups people.

I'm way sucking up. lot us aren't. We've lost, what? 150,000 people here? That's fucking sad disgusting. point, feel options call, email, sit inside getting fat keeping family safe. power stop right now, I'd it. fucking CDC even power. words express terribly US mishandled this.

#3 percent tested covid-19.

A weeks ago, 17,000 Gothenburgers ages 0-90 received covid-19 test home mailbox .

The idea mass test try get idea role, example, age, overcrowding factors play infection. random selection, people without symptoms must also captured. 

6,132 17,000 people responded 3 percent positive. 

- corresponding survey done Stockholm, 2.3 percent carried virus. shows continuing ongoing spread infection society pandemic far over, says infection control doctor Leif Dotevall. 

Five areas varying forms housing socio-economic conditions included mass test: suburbs Biskopsg√•rden Bergsj√∂n, Majorna Haga / Vasastaden central Gothenburg, residential area √ñrgryte.

The randomly selected households take samples themselves. given stick instructions insert nose throat pack submit analysis. 

- Someone lost cap, filled name correctly, overall worked well, says Leif Dotevall.

Now statistics take examine infection distributed age districts. dropout must also investigated.

- 36 percent answered think analyzable. 6,000 individuals large number people fact selected random strengthens material, says Leif Dotevall. 

The advanced analyses expected completed week 31.

At time, course, testing people seek care symptoms covid-19 continues. Around 20,000 tested every week, Leif Dotevall believes largest investment country. 

In tests, number cases detected decreases radically. Week 26 2,000 cases, week 27 1,206 week 28 - 681. 

- see almost halving week week, pretty real decline. despite fact still try many. 

**What think depends on?**

- know, certainly helps move outdoors work. Still, want say - - parties shopping malls, infection spreads. random survey shows bus store, may someone around contagious, says infection control doctor Leif Dotevall. lol yeah, way relate anything other. girlfriend Doctor southern state Family Medicine. 

She says hospital patients either straight lying, denial contracting COVID. people come office something, waiting room etc randomly tell physicians ""oh yea wanted see test results Covid test took last week"" find fact positive.

Wearing mask giving virus letting take freedom (in minorly inconvenient way) ain't gonna it. Give liberty give scarred lungs vascular damage life! probably way higher this. Half states attribute deaths virus person positive test died. countries deaths attributed Coronavirus symptoms present satisfied probably cause. far know testing post-mortem presence virus.

Plus people die cause exacerbated virus. attributed virus although direct cause death.

And sick people go hospital worried virus die home, people go hospital receive required standard care staff exhausted supplies running low everything slower precautions take. people indirectly killed virus.

Note Australia, pawns political games hate seeing burgeoning anti-intelectualism Americans seem set about. 

When epidemic started, supply lines constrained. finite stock masks.
If Faucci got news encouraged ordinary people wear would absolute run masks put vital supplies health care workers risk (this semi happened anyway).

Instead told general public masks needed recommended social distancing self-isolation. 
This perfectly reasonable course action, followed similar approach (for part) avoided serious impact.

Americans handle simple approach, protested demanded reopening well advance necessary shutdown. resulted significant community transmittion.

Now supply lines masks stabilised production caught up, situation degraded point masks absolute necessity slowing spread. Faucci recommends general public use masks. 

He followed logical approach balanced severity situation supply demand masks prioritised needs risk.

The thing messed approach irrationality lack common sense seen amongst American general public. Nah, look Sweden Brazil, strategy virus literally nothing all, least US little lockdown there... mean, wrong least somewhat tried bare minimun. mistaken, Fauci one people can't fired whitehouse, nonsense playing out, think second they'd definitely want puppet sure planet Ugh, dreadful company deal doubt make better. 25% HIV positivity population lol Except following people get sick, following get positive test result.

So lag symptoms onset, probably day 2 denial/wait see gets bad going get tested, also delaying testing results taking 10 days places. Realistically case hear may well closer ICU/death bit, rather infection date, lag time number cases hear month sure, unless testing people day get infected, Interesting

For theory make sense start assumption discover indeed reinfected virus based recent studies question.

My theory reason seeing varying levels illness recent studies proven sewage tests dating way back 2019 virus us longer initially thought. knowing people saying well pandemic start sooner? Perhaps happening assuming reinfection possible depending number times infected dictates ill based infection slowly damaging body. Say ppl first infection generally asymptomatic mildly ill, clears confusion ppl get sick don't. reach third even possibly four time infected people ending hospital serious complications due prior damage last boughts fighting off. 

Again expert way claiming facts theory true would fill lot blanks including different countries seeing varying degrees illness death. Places like Italy others Europe perhaps tourists hot spots already population go first second infections ppl third fourth hence seeing hospitalization death.

I'm saying people *want* people infected/dying, seeing numbers highlighted green pluses next generally would indicate something positive. 

I wonder subliminal, psychological effect would instead showing increases numbers cases, showed total population ""healthy"" people subtracted day based positive tests, highlighted numbers red minus signs instead.

Man bad... disregards people die every year well. loose 3 - 3.5 million people year anyway, that‚Äôs 12 million deaths since election. Father Time undefeated. Swedish strategy supporters. I've informed via goal right, ilk negative. Apologies. ""kind"" better word: Swedish strategy supporters.

Funny they're greenhouse gasses unaware CO2.

Do source contradicts information? I'd happy read even though that's main point here. Cheers either way! Grew Minnesota, miles Canadian border, family still farm there.

Ugh comments Facebook toward Rachel Levine appalling. Facebook page every time he‚Äôd make update. 
Ok, well since possibly maybe clearly cant understand information please tell probability mask anything percentage, could tell percentage probability risk reduction wearing n95 surgical mask?

Face mask use could result large reduction risk infection (n=2647; aOR 0¬∑15, 95% CI 0¬∑07 0¬∑34, RD ‚àí14¬∑3%, ‚àí15¬∑9 ‚àí10¬∑7; low certainty), stronger associations N95 similar respirators compared disposable surgical masks similar (eg, reusable 12‚Äì16-layer cotton masks;¬†pinteraction=0¬∑090; posterior probability low certainty).

Yes, correct love certainty, certainty get us humans way maybe. Short real story, guy thinks Earth flat, guy builds steam powered rocket prove Earth flat. First attempt, guy says get high enough see Earth flat. Second attempt, guy dies steam powered rocket crash. ‚ÄúMad Mike didn‚Äôt believe gravity. Flat-Earthers don‚Äôt. ‚ÄúObjects simply fall,‚Äù reads the¬†Flat Earth website, best way demonstrate scientific validity declare conclusion giving data validate it.""

The problem mask know mask help controlled studies. Real life people understand wear mask. pushing wearing mask dangerous gives people idea shielded virus things avoided. 

And discussion, following rules without mask risky (coughing shirt arm, touching face, washing hands)? far provided proof mask better. I'd interested see concessions, restrooms, employee safety handled. would look it. 

1. Figure many square feet classroom space school has.
2. Figure many people (teachers students) school have. Evidently divide half school's number load staggered schedule.
3. Compare CDC guidelines. Unless school loaded cash, nowhere near enough space even come close CDC guidelines.

If principal come convincing explanation comply CDC guidelines need hard NOPE. Can't act like human president shares nothing common normal humans narcissistic sociopath got lonely last adult Washington.  take BMI info COVID lightly. BMI outdated. lot people body build muscular higher BMIs muscle weights fat raise BMI. look body building subs see it. need study body fat percent instead. One conclude USA has, highest levels, decided rapid uncontrolled spread SARS2 desired. 

That's happens Trump, Ph.D. clinical psychology, given us granular portrait Trump‚Äôs profound impairment: says uncle nine clinical criteria narcissism, although insists diagnosis tip psychological iceberg‚Äîhe may also suffer antisocial personality disorder, sociopathy, and/or dependent personality disorder, along undiagnosed learning disability likely interferes ability process one insists except people fell con artists who've decades underplayed racist western countries are.  Every county different, agreed. That's new statewide restrictions little heavy handed IMO. create restrictions areas surges, case Allegheny County.

Keep vigilant health. got wave one two. may get wave three. last 3 months? COVID increasingly affecting younger people.

Let's say somehow government bends rules gets pushed sooner - going asshole wanting get vaccine year two? don‚Äôt think 1 year gonna make break kid. I've avoided Kroger past month due taking covid seriously whatsoever. mask mandate long overdue. Honestly, fuck Kroger. Yep, honestly, even dont give everyone vaccine, fatality rate drop significantly focusing getting high risk groups like older people, people health issues, etc immunity. groups make vast majority deaths would make virus atleast somewhat tolerable. Watch do, say. Actions speak larger words. goal economy breaking hospital system. want enough controls place that. Otherwise death rate, illness, etc doesn‚Äôt matter.

Shot foot really damaged credibility. country. masks got politicized. could gotten pandemic control said spring wear them.

So, ironically, portion blame pandemic continuing organization whose job stop it. 

When historians write books pandemic, CDC going show very, poorly. moment designed handle, shining moment, utterly failed. (And lying masks.) managers requiring employees come work test getting results, thus spreading disease. Thanks, relic way back.

Especially since right, wrong time good point also studies found people lost immunity within 5-10 years. reinfection would possible. 
That said, many infections people get twice usually considered cause immunity (like measles chickenpox). remember utterly terrified transfixed morbid dread UK hit 1000 deaths day hospitals 95%, watching numbers go hoping would go we'd locked weeks.

The US now, hospitals overflowing 1000 deaths day, yet they're absolutely nothing it. insane. theory states empire/kingdom eventually fall corruption decadence internals trife stuff? COVID numbers South rise Antibodies provide protection duration time, thus earliest infected first reinfected. 

The millions infected April later distraction issue, look infected March earlier.

 /r/covid19positive , search ""reinfected""; there's enough merit research actually confirm what's going cases, say sick covid symptoms early year.

Complicating this, testing sparse early year, missing vast majority people infected window reinfections would start happening. *The failure test people early year makes return symptoms positive test ""unconvincing"" reoccurence.* See problem?

We're going get conclusive answer reinfections data set positive test results whatever threshold needs verifiable repeatable. could another months. 

**Anecdote time:** 

I diagnosed probable/presumed covid doctor back late March, way would allowed test became severe enough admitted ER.

 Thankfully severe, symptoms eventually faded, finally allowed test 2 weeks symptoms ended, getting negative result. 

I still wore mask, physical distances, etc, almost certain it, thus almost certain immune reinfection. 

Now fast forward week. exposed last week someone covid symptoms still waiting test results, got tested Monday, I've showing symptoms since Tuesday. Obviously need test results say sure what's going on, clearly something viral happening. said another comment, boss, I'd assume others, forcing us back office even though telework recommended whole time. No! leaders wrong politics don‚Äôt know? Well last reply got removed automod explained beliefs come certain man lives White House USA, explanation political sub. 

They pick man's opinion daughter physician exposed regularly since March without getting sick. 110 people died, 100 less people hospital. think get one.

But many wear mask. much infectious? Infectious change trump? every single person America got it, percentage would die long lasting permanent damage? Maybe 25 30 percent? That's lot people! there‚Äôs another reason [the severity outbreak right now. that‚Äôs perceived speed outbreak initially landed American shores started killing people. lack testing let virus run free February much March. colleague Robinson Meyer [put ‚ÄúWithout testing, one way know severity outbreak: counting dead.‚Äù *is* figured bad outbreak was. Thousands began dying greater New York City area cities around country early April. seven-day average new cases peaked April 10, followed peak seven-day average daily deaths 11 days later.  seemed happen once: lots cases, lots hospitalizations, lots deaths. also compression memory. us remember deaths March beginning quickly cases, especially given testing debacle. That‚Äôs exactly happened, however. nation did, fact, see cases rise weeks death toll shot up. time March detected 100 cases death recorded. crucial metric gets perceived gap cases deaths. tells us *did* see lag rising cases deaths back spring.

This thing ""But deaths decreasing!"" folks miss. know problem early people started dying test several weeks like now. what's likely:

The Russian government somehow holds sway every Republican governor coercing stuff like (even though governors like Abbott Ivey relented ordered masks)

or

An ideology denounces greater good betterment society cares individual leads dumb decision-making lancet Monday sounding like engineered attack China. mean said doctors nurses could enough use people dealing COVID daily basis? 

Context thing. RIGHT way think Cause ""muh freedumbs."" science still pretty much worthless. takes years tease confounding factors. Since ""better safe sorry"" stop good idea? can't falsely rationalize virus expect pay attention. saying things directly contradict said before; virus changed availability PPE changed. lost credibility moment pretended masks ineffective except medical possessionals. sure would safe, damn sure better starting month leader express desire - save one, know one. Nothing increases speed testing quite like shutting labs fewer facilities handle tests! /s Trump wont president time vaccines ready distribution. Dont need worry that- 1000s illegal things done. Blacklist non-compliers airlines do...

The CDC Says US Could Get Coronvirus Control Everyone Could Would Get Vaccinated

(""Who Could"" always people medically cannot take vaccination.)

The answer one also going great big ""Nope."" Wtf people crying help August? USA please, love anything good world, tell satire kind joke really actual ad actual governor one states? latest financial statement : endowment 350 million

forbes article : Meanwhile, Notre Dame used zero public funds made money football: $63 million (revenue: $96.8M, expenses: $33.2M).

other googling : total revenue notre dame sports 98 million total expenses 78 million non football sports make million spend 55 million

it's impossible guess much total cost would saved (since coaches still paid, equipment still purchased, buildings still heated, etc etc) definitely less athletic endowment (not even counting boosters give every year pass golden dome around Ahhh finally, impotence oops mean impetus need COVID taken seriously... known jan others feels like reddit knew ages everyone else ?? 'problem' US would situation countries bit bullet went lock reopen economy quickly, thereby minimizing loss lives damage economy.

But no, wearing mask prevent things obviously big sacrifice. Imaging forced wear mask! next - cover rest body? Oh wait. Fuck Bill DAMN DR. FAUCI! DON‚ÄôT KNOW VIRUS ALSO SPREADS ADDRESS DIRECTLY?

If real competent doctor, would drop whole thing, support idea reason US setting world records number cases daily cause higher number tests done, incompetent response.

President, may well call Dr. Trump point best solutions best strategies deal pandemic. gotta believe!

If isn‚Äôt obvious now, satire. I‚Äôm even American, guys bad couldn‚Äôt miss opportunity. happens over? Anyone reason, medical otherwise, another nuanced reason can't go anywhere ever again? We're suddenly treating non mask wearers way shoplifters robbers? best ways go that. I'm issue PA too. boss saying COVID solved need come back show things like says BS either 

1. Gov. Wolf wants destroy economy prevent Trump re-elected, or
2. Germaphobes taken instilling fear paranoia world ""we cannot let germaphobes win""

HR shit since wife. would leave job could gotta mortgage look fucking economy. insane. felt mildly sick signed test. fudged symptoms little drove cvs. got results 4 days later. ... uh...what?....uh...omg. honest, frustrated watching conference. hoping would actually mandate something make change, partly nothing else seems work. expect leaders able make tough choices, even they‚Äôre unpopular. work dentist one red (technically purple won‚Äôt say it) counties Ohio, number people tell won‚Äôt wear mask despite mandate crazy me. time working, never imagined private office would shut government, seeing sheer stubborness people comes simple solutions makes clear necessary. Reading comments, almost hope right, Gov DeWine trying first providing warning mandating bring virus control. It‚Äôs definitely first choice, honest, seems like way. seems like Gov DeWine treating us like children warnings, honestly think deserve it. never appreciated Gov DeWine recently saw inept governors Florida Georgia making decisions. ""Mild obesity"" surely term exist. parents live Washington Alaska. sign something entry Canada says stop even food, gas, contact Canadians way Alaska. fine hefty. wonder ppl assumed ok. Like frightened turtle nursing home decision wrong many levels. actual order Cuomo required nursing homes admit patients suspected tested positive COVID-19. order also said nursing homes adult facilities ""prohibited requiring hospitalized resident determined medically stable tested COVID-19 prior admission readmission.""¬†He went way pave way death least 5,800 people. Criminal. I‚Äôm talking victims themselves. someone plays safe, gets virus home delivery something else freakish dies, it‚Äôs irresponsible. legally mandated, would go effect many days mandated, it‚Äôs making excuses, it‚Äôs logistics real world. Like someone made comment, people need trained handle people, call, procedures etc. I‚Äôm making excuses anyone, think everyone wearing mask, suddenly change policy people, makes irate customers makes things worse. Yes school option imo it‚Äôs time put energy plan B terms distance learning, outside learning, supporting unemployed financially terms childcare, etc hope vaccine available January US 4th world country now, position got even 3rd world countries dumb significant amount people? people know dangerous selfish. Guessing latter large number democrats well. Doesn‚Äôt excuse administration. understand problem. Thank you; really appreciated LOL @ 4quatloos! Nicely done. That's great, need follow straight right. Yeah city mask requirement county care lots people go gastions dollar general mask,same drivers Pepsi Budweiser stockers going different place wearing mask, No, do. least, mislead. Remember said masks effective (because wanted go medical personnel)? That's lie. matter new information, anyone even rudimentary knowledge respiratory viruses knew bullshit back then.
 say opposite, people take statements credibility lost. happens lie public, even reason. lame stupid reply. 12? people aware it, thanks. atleast 13 million cases coronavirus world, probably 20-30 million actual cases due asymptomatic carriers, lack testing, etc.

And yet see actual scientific analysis single person reinfected, know lack evidence doesnt mean something isnt happening, right I'm thinking virus isnt able easily reinfect people. 

Obviously scientific analysis, studies find people actually reinfected, would definitely change mind, right now, many cases been, lack real evidence reinfection, I'm going believe doesnt. fucking way Im taking rushed vaccine history. Excessive mask mandates science shows necessary. outdoors moving around (running, walking, biking) need wear mask. takes time virus infect (contact tracing looks ppl spent 15+ minutes). 

And doesn‚Äôt stop bunch ignorant asshats shouting jogging. Shouting behind masks don‚Äôt really even need wearing outside walking around own. 

That‚Äôs rabid extreme. people like step away wanting everyone wear masks home. 

Wear masks indoors times. Stay small quarantine inner circle don‚Äôt hang large groups without distancing masks. things you‚Äôll fine. it‚Äôs like get weird pride subjecting excessive mask use. Yup. criminal, two ways about. Yeah papa nature Doxing threats banable offense.

4. See works

5. Decide means 

6. Tell people learned use information nice.

;-) It‚Äôs big country. It‚Äôs risk tolerance selfishness anything. think people making decisions truly believe vaccine within next months turn tide. believe 2 years Senate/gubernatorial seats grabs able run campaign based success stopping covid ""restarting"" economy problems retaining seats. disturbing part probably right. [Here states (as 5 days ago) 200 new cases per million residents *rising*. critical point governors *tighten*.

Let's see works them. New Englanders - keeping distance, respecting masks.

This happening Maine least North Mississippi part Maine live in. According large part local population masks scared little pussies, governor dictator needs impeached. honestly think Maines' remoteness, state travelers *early* way low counts. nothing population proactive this. Americans love killin' themselves. awful. Mastriano going around live-streaming driving one biggest deniers - dude hack today portion /s, assumed part sarcasm blame They'll platitude cases drop off, like recommending masks workplaces closing stadiums week two. dropping cases. plus cognitive dissonance makes ""believable"" base butthurt post Ive ever seen here. Ontario (Canada) still debating back school strategy September. Options seem be:

1. fully in-person learning deep cleaning, masks distancing, sports risky activities
2. fully on-line learning, like spring (with mixed results)
3. hybrid approach half class school one week half next week
4. class time high school, group students work one subject (ex: math) 5 weeks straight earn credit, next subject

Keep mind, still know proceed - province 13M+ people yesterday 102 new cases province wide. reference, Los Angeles County cases entire country:  see monster is...his lap dog cock- sucking governors trying ban cities mandating mask wearing. That's genocide, plain simple. need hold criminally responsible piss poor decision. Ditto. I'm already planning strategy. I'm high risk WFH getting curbside/delivery. Gonna risk Nov hope extend early voting.  question well. follow Covid Tracking Project updates every day, I'm pretty sure get data directly county state officials. Sure Trump try fudge numners White House releases, normal people definitely trust CTP them... simply concerned Gen 3 Gen 4 vaccines. believe vaccines currently market safe. people Kemp cares about.

Sadly, unsurprisingly, great majority Florida. Lmao US one leading vaccine candidates. sub sometimes... Guess wear mask *AND* condom times....

Apparently not. 

Meanwhile I‚Äôm sitting apartment like ‚Äúmy downstairs neighbor‚Äôs best friend‚Äôs dad visiting Florida, probably shouldn‚Äôt go see folks couple weeks.‚Äù Playing six degrees COVID Bacon times. Whilst appreciate concept guided discovery, agree cases tactic works best, may strategy works effect, overlooking another potential strategy, cut losses move on. yes, realise 'moving on' condemning fate anti-intellectualism beliefs. 

If drowning, make mistake *we drowning*, would kick away person that's trying drag ocean floor them? matter find someone explain scientific process people (and public actually internalizes it). then, science continue collection facts pretty experiments popular science makes be. think root issues antivaxx, climate change denial, etc. People realize long, slow moving process science think Google search blogs random, poorly connected facts valid someone's career. emotional spokesperson going change scientific method inherently boring unemotional. Astrazeneca, distributer Thats sounds like hard work, Trump way.
 
What if, instead, pretended gone? put half much energy fighting coronavirus Fauchi, might better shape. reports antibodies last. herd immunity. true counties get control understanding issue enforce mask wearing...they'll get control whereas not. Could imagine banned traveling countries can't get control? Seriously? go work? many people drag kids work/school really sick pre outbreak? many. outbreak going change mentality. 
Sure temp checks, everyone fever.
Jobs schools need evolve. Much greater separation other. know going easy, better alternative. Companies government needs rise what's right humanity. Forget big oil political crap. Spend tax payer money critical needs now. Oh going get money? billions spending destroying world? Nuclear weapons, carriers, aircraft? Fuck Germany countries focus people, would take shot every 3 months? sounds strange. Georgia counties secceed rebel, hear Georgian tradition. Everyone build statues leaders, even fail. clear, cell immunity reinfection could well possible, would also probably milder symptoms.

I concede full immunity. likelihood potential second infection milder reassuring me. But, guarantee state inspector comes pull workers volunteers files showing completed training isolation protocols, bloodborne airborne pathogens, etc. Grandma nursing home know reality vs claim are. 

So yes perfect world staff nursing home well equipped trained deal patients. know could exaggerate symptoms get one extremely easily right Especially they‚Äôre unable vote person mail him. thought Dewine one good guys start covid, what's making push masks? politics seep in? think seatbelt laws, speeding tickets, public indecency laws also unconstitutional? Trump administration directing hospitals send coronavirus data private technology firm instead CDC. middle pandemic. feel like bigger news. That's people read ""cancer breakthrough"" think anything short literal cure falls bar called ""breakthrough"".

The truth is, many breakthroughs significantly lowered chance death specific types cancer, repeatedly. That's cancer survival rates across board. cant dumb realize schools would increase spread. Yes mod, would. 

ANY RHETORIC PUT SOMEONE ELSE RISK MUST SILENCED. 

Period. I‚Äôm rural Ohio would say it‚Äôs even lower. Maybe 20 percent people wearing masks. know PutinBay bunch cases now. matter find someone explain scientific process people (and public actually internalizes it). then, science continue collection facts pretty experiments popular science makes be. think root issues antivaxx, climate change denial, etc. People realize long, slow moving process science think Google search blogs random, poorly connected facts valid someone's career. emotional spokesperson going change scientific method inherently boring unemotional. aware US relies military complex keep economy going. That's guys love war much.

Shit's got nothing goodwill. I‚Äôm surprised. Acting like clearly nature can‚Äôt won‚Äôt anything it. Anybody know way get stopped? Seriously, seems extremely dangerous. can't let happen like everything else. Every comment fauci cocksucker. It‚Äôs ridiculous. guy literally spouted bullshit. ‚ÄúDont wear masks!‚Äù ‚ÄúWear masks!‚Äù Oh fuck off. He‚Äôs smart trump WHOs thumb. matter time catch level exposure.

You mitigate risk:

1. Take vitamin get plenty sunshine.
2. Take Zinc plus ionophore (Quercetin GBCB)

With 2 precautions significantly lower serious reaction getting infected control Senate pass. House pass sorts things go nowhere Senate. literally say that, did. least assuming trying imply. 


What say skews data, plain simple. trying sweep rug add bunch conjecture relevant post. not. Thanks sharing. Screw situation kind endorsement even needs happen. hate timeline. orange buffoon endorsing Goya middle this. another add that's even look worldometers Germany see still infections quite low. three four weeks total lockdown decreased infection rate significantly.
Now people wear masks soon enter shop restaurant allowed put eat. far know theaters open wear mask every second seat empty. 
There still strange things like prostitutes allowed work long wear masks, quite happy way germany manages it.

The important thing everyone wear masks. helps lot heart bleedd watching american friends helped shape Germany country today suffer president people deny virus.

You beat virus! together! Different people learn different ways. Army boot camps don‚Äôt guide gently see light. berate want constructive feed back. sample size way small, definition intelligence incredibly narrow, data collection method part society ostracizes self reporting. Title ""People willing admit wear masks might worse short term memory."" 71750 final official numbers new infections yesterday 1001 Dalmatians, sorry that's deaths. Even life saving surgery even didn‚Äôt die line, still would wait day results. Sounds like cause death may condition needed surgery for, waiting line. test rapid test done hospital case. Wow great. opinion, could great human achievements moon landings reaching Mariana trench. Truly inspiring work. something something muh freedoms missing like 4 weeks recently? Probably Conservatives retarded Thanks. Can't watch shit stuck work least paper happened. Surfing big waves transcendental experience. encourage people try it.

Should message silenced? Exactly this. There's nothing new sun Michigan 861, one one guy work construction with. I'm getting tested today. Hard fall apart never together first place deaths down? 15,000 dead? positive cases reported, virus inevitably seems worse is.

dude spun ONE stupid event (that's corrected...) national conspiracy...  Snap it. drill hoax. Wise up. Exactly, weirdo went history. take things context even took half sentence make point. found surprising went super villain super hero. Ah okay, listened thought heard Johan Carlson say ""from midsummer"" on. country hit covid already wearing mask ALWAYS public indoor places, cognitive problem. Definitely true. know got line thought last night. think realization threw close 20 years war, 3,000 dead. complete strangers me, killed still child. somehow call 135,000 dead gravy. found realization extremly upsetting. games playing smh remember thinking thing heard President Trump called Germany's Chancellor Merkel 'stupid' face. (She doctorate physics something like that.) Evidently reacted similarly - reporters used quote (""it rolled like water duck's back"").

Relatively people secure enough abilities able that.

Conversely, insecure people tend lash attempt retaliate question abilities. Yes is, called keep people saying it???

Not sure that's hard concept understand. 

Say something put another harm's way, get message silenced. say federal government power first place. state local level Yeah. Right seem like bitterly divorced couple, seizing pretext try destroy other. morning updated numbers I'm coward, doubt, long there's risk adverse effects I'd willing take (during trials) confirmed safe I'd eager get vax. vein, potential side effects? know, virtually 0 chance side affects? Yes, stop nonsense fight coronavirus 

Trump doubt, foolish optimism far deadly. I'm glad read comment section.  Breaking news; reddit users confirm today reinfection possible (despite hundreds medical professionals say may be).

Thank god clarity professionals here, otherwise may listen science. true. good news, past months view towards irresponsible crowd Americans obviously plummeted point want crossing border. trust care anyone themselves. I'm sure he's genuinely baffled President would politicize pandemic turn public health culture war issue. Agree. second someone gets ""passionate"" gets sensationalized twisted. Fauci's approach ignoring drama focusing lane powerful hard twist. paper shit too. Small sample size self reporting. Title read ""People willing admit wear masks might lower short term memory"" Absolutely. That, inability admit wrong. Ah yes ‚Äúdon‚Äôt it‚Äù warning 

Pretty much whenever see anything, go ahead back away.

Fucking stupid, people STILL think reopening schools good idea? Wait, thought Republican position 'one size dosent fit all"" local leaders know what's best individual communities?


And mask ban suggestion state dosent really plan enforcing? Well said. agree much damage done even death occurs. can't 100 million permanently damaged dead people. But, muh Facebook told deaths exhaggerated anyone died COVID gets counted COVID death? /s Fuck you. Take mask (along entitlement arrogance) cram bad boy straight inside asshole. 

If afraid, stay fuck home snowflake. reporting negative cases, 

oh, :) 

So clear - think whole mess media beatup? Covid-19 big deal go back normal?

All countries massive problems part this? 
all new cases hoaxes?  

How convince this? I'm curious. media sources listen / watch?  get news Facebook etc? Can‚Äôt read this...

Maybe English second language? Took long idiots levelheaded. incredible. that‚Äôs true, *choose* wear one nothing happen guess. aren‚Äôt required wear masks shop, point original comment? Walmart one, shop somewhere else. nobody else area cares, would targeted? Magical Minefield Earth‚Ñ¢. I‚Äôve also seen people blame NY/NJ bringing virus South/other states. ‚ÄúWell everyone state traveled months ago brought virus!‚Äù response travel restrictions like... half states. I‚Äôm like... would cause spikes now, three four months later?... No, would not. 

Everything fault apparently. lol enough eradicate virus. Goddamn *are* morons Umm. idea many years covid steals human life expectancy long term yet, as, fucking us humans last 9 months, appear long term health impacts: survivors initial infections appear increased risks strokes blood clots, extensive damage every major body system. people getting re-infected/re-lapse getting MUCH sicker second time around, damage may cumulative number infections. Pretending obesity bigger killer here? dealing known facts, really idea many covid kill initial infections. yea, obesity bad, covid appears lifelong broad health impacts too. haven‚Äôt time quantify yet tho. Netherlands okay now, although smaller regional clusters emerging. surprise considering country opened time ago testing become better available. Perhaps somewhere near future, especially colder outside spend time inside, might see regional lockdown, long hospitals overwhelmed much issue. noted unlike many countries exception public transport, face masks compulsory almost none wearing them. *The middle east entered chat* Crazy adult professionals able conduct maturity poise despite feeling anger resentment. crowded funeral days üò£

Please enjoy disease-ridden dollars, would happy print citizens buy. see whats happening parts country? say late closing, true, really think people underestimate lack public support closing early weeks March. remember clearly riding train terrified 3/2. Everyone else super nonchalant. telling coworkers would shut would say everyone overreacting going happen.  think right risks exposure air travel. People terrible wearing masks long period time - say 3 hours airport full people plus least 2 hours plane? touching many communal things (hand rails, arm rests, chairs), plus generally breathing recirculated air? I‚Äôd less worried filtration worried touching face, eating drinking. People terrible touching face eyes etc. also terrible washing hands. Spending 3 hours plane doesn‚Äôt equate spending time doctors appointment. 

Your Mom's argument great example false equivalence:   many people doctors offices? long stay? kind filtration system used? bet air pressurized.

Come Mom, better! thought stole PPE states governors smuggling food trucks. Whatever happened supplies? death rates down? Sadly, no. kind thing makes ashamed live... nose mouth connected. Every time smell something, tasting well. professional ethics treat them.

Doesn't mean functional society apply political force stop antisocial behavior. Thank god got ahead problem! maybe people want risk chance dying getting seriously ill? seen single post ""fetishizes"" bad stuff going on, calls caution societies governments dangerously blas√© it. person forced work gen pop throughout seen fair share mask-holes disagree but, made (possibly) unfair assumptions make think guests going worse.

I see there's mask free relaxation zone screams idiotic breeding space stupid guests hang other. people presumably fools since Disney opened asking trouble hanging other.

I assume Disney running full staff since staff probably scared minds (like staff is) make vigilant efforts distance guests way might make okay. They're sitting rides standing lines close guests, serve probably distance get away with.

I concede particularly restaurant hotel staff going rough go thinks think there's still practical measures keep little better shit situation. one is. That's NOVEL means. much this. honestly idea interpreting words such, unless intentionally. One person lying imply anyone else always told truth. know else say simpler that. two people, one lies once, automatically believe person always on? wouldn't, also trust first person either. Nah, it‚Äôs ppl like America mess is. That's interesting, I'll ask time future. tests covid infection cleared, seemed pretty thorough showed nothing elevated. Uh, let's see. Here's link from, um, (apparently disprove agree. people yelling kill everyone annoy me. thing potentially mess rest life ( seems worse dying ). anecdotal reports often saying second time worse, like story. cousin found contact tracers said might it. got tested -- sure enough, isolate couple weeks tested negative. symptoms all. I've wondering that's peoples' first run goes. dovetails timeline earlier initially thought (e.g. positive samples found late last year earlier year previously documented). Exactly

This ridiculous. Words meaning. nothing misleading title. 

The whiners may drama queens. Louisiana: ""Lets drink it."" &lt;takes mask talks ""uh nice leave."" Thank you. I‚Äôm feeling sacrifice even heavier lost dad last week stage IV esophageal cancer - supposed get two weeks got called really need back lot residents COVID/exposures. 2020 sucks ass. Ironically Massachusetts mask requirements everywhere indoors months now.  anybody surprised? stay Florida beginning partner normal cadence, period two months depressed/stressed sex. Things better lately we've gotten used new norm, yeah rough second. policy perspective may smartest move. time spreading around article antibody articles show reinfection possible majority population point spreading misinformation. scientific consensus reinfection either occurred (issues test sensitivity reactivation) extremely rare (which point Nate Silver's analysis). people taking additional precautions whatever slow spread even going far, scientist think misinterpretation data spreading false conclusions way positive happened before, happen again.

*cue battle star galactic theme music* Except work school, two indoor environments virus spreads easily. Oh thank much! I‚Äôll check I‚Äôm work. really appreciate that, it‚Äôs really nice feel cared about. I‚Äôve feeling pretty dark/jaded it‚Äôs refreshing stranger kind :). Thank brightening mood. Fuck war analogy bullshit, we're trying go work pay bills like rest you. Watching trump talk day headache today üò≥ ""has underlying breath conditions prevent wearing mask."" 

To me, implies really bad breath, guess makes dizzy unable breathe? *breathing* condition?

I guess get pay non-medical-doctor write medical exemption. Haha thank you, coping mechanism. Like he's letting Trump's dumps hit floor he's grabbing wrote multiple comments assuming 10% U.S. infected. generous saying high estimate get lowest IFR 'could be' counter people saying low 0.2%. even mentioned deaths lag older people getting infected lagged too. still believe IFR 0.5% 1%. Keep times, fedex man ups. ""Bizarre,"" overly polite opinion, he's classy say ""positively moronic."" design.

The US healthcare system set impenetrable box spits randomized charges dependent absolutely nothing. defended ""free market"" advocates assert rational consumers take business elsewhere prices high--completely ignoring fact prices often revealed point sale *and* consumers can't rational kept dark need something urgent lifesaving. Deleting account admission wrong, cowards way hiding wrong. Trump got [embarrassed Kemp clean up. 

Then residents Georgia get die. personally don‚Äôt see booster vaccines big roadblock people think, governments know don‚Äôt provide boosters happen reinfection severe symptoms possible. India: still done first one! ‚Äòlook there! nothing see here‚Äô please switch UBI instead social safety nets require go poor able get them? retail store job, says $300 receives government food assistance month enough family four, includes elderly mother two grandchildren, ages 5 14, raising daughter died. Food bank handouts become lifeline. even asymptomatic/mild patients suffer internal damage. need update stats soon. Thought worse flu? it??? India pretty unique number system. There's indian number system there's international number system. nobody argues beacuse India actually invented numbers Thank you! would expect though, low infection numbers deaths, Greece's R0 Re/Rt similar say really complaints. long belligerent customer absolutely refuse wear one explicitly required. Also, record, proponent public nudity similar argument lol still waiting see impact T1 has. seems issues well controlled increase. They're out-of-pocket cost several reasons least prohibitive costs discourages potentially affected testing. First person anecdotes illuminating, [but data news reports Sweden ""better expected (by many)"". Yes. well compared Nordics? No. experience severe strain? Yes. still severe strain many places paradoxically becoming strained pandemic wanes people seek care? Yep. I‚Äôm saying there‚Äôs capacity hasn‚Äôt used. Primary care providers (‚Äúv√•rdcentraler‚Äù) emergency rooms much less busy normal people avoided going there, problem. That‚Äôs fewer cases cancer heard disease found, covid patients taken operations wards.

Ok that's fair. reason patients seeking care directly related Sweden's poor management virus. Finland, one scared get care since burden infection low low quite time now. last week two *starting* become case Sweden causing problems. effect hardly overstated since death rate goes exponentially relationship age. think galaxy shutdown would even better...wait second, shutting universe would best. Yes. Also, carbs created equally. Also, low-carb diets created equally. assume poster alluded keto something similar. definitely necessary lower inflammation, really, might increase it, many animal proteins known so. might need two months not. National shutdown poor idea many places different spots outbreak. 

In Hawaii, done well outbreak fault mainland get sorted out. getting hammered economy shitshow continues, escalates. think Americans collective this. simply appear enough data yet know hell happening. Reinfection, bad test, bad prior tests, dormant virus flaring up, something else thought yet. would seem possible though necessarily probable. Oh cool, she'll pay lot money lose case, make even pissed entitled. comparison, puts deaths New York official numbers March 26th 27th, four five days **after** shutting down. 

Approximately 12 days later, New York hit 1000 deaths per day curve beginning flatten. hard compare exactly since Florida's number far sporadic day day, serve rough approximation bad bad going get next weeks get current wave flattened soon.

4 weeks later, May 1st, New York's deaths per day 225. Florida Public Schools scheduled open 4 weeks. brainwashing effective. That‚Äôs shocking, I‚Äôm shocked much lately. lol TL;DR lost dad last week (not COVID related, esophageal cancer four year fight) could take week need back due surges. back ward Monday bury dad Saturday. much rage heart towards people careless, especially now. 2020 supposed great year, graduated med school matched dream program/speciality... it‚Äôs grim. Death everywhere. It‚Äôs horrible. Definitely tests strength human. 

Rant thanks reading :)  keep going bars ditch masks, America realized worldometers updated yesterday‚Äôs death count 1001. breaking 1000 daily deaths inherently meaningful, it‚Äôs certainly sign better times come. man literally deals death daily basis.  doesnt surprise undiagnosed dementia patient popularity complex doesnt phase him. Also people tend notice relatives die regardless spin things. Home schooling tends higher rate success han public although attributed parents involved.  


An influx uninvolved parents, outsource interaction teachers, home school world surely reduce averages  


Given 1/3rd nation unemployed sure choice huge number students whose parents encourage complete virtual work. simply dont participate. elementary level, especially, grades motivation them. levels, do? Fail all? *IF* yes would absolutely help types airborne droplet based illnesses! It‚Äôs like people say ‚Äúmore people die flu‚Äù well know could less deaths flu wore masks regularly cold flu season. Whats fun people crying ""fear monger"" literally people like ""i'm gonna go big city get mugged dumb n*****!"" judge better throw case. make pay lawyer‚Äôs fees.

I'm pretty sure we'll back one day maybe even take Euro, try rub noses it, even though probably deserve it. said EU grown-ups every stage whilst politicians petulant liars - name billionaires making ""disaster capitalism"" fortune - hence bankrolling damage...

And fun, next days it'll become officially public knowledge much interference we've recent elections report they've refused publish published finally bit coup! Changing constitution president 2036

Wait, what? BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL. NYE SCIENCE GUY Walgreens, course. Fucking stooges still first wave. he's joking dude fucking demented idiot Fireball.. that's name heard long time..... long time... Either way, understand peoples comments saying losing immunity makes vaccine useless. large scale temporary immunity still efficient choking virus social distancing? Especially keep getting boosters. starting remind Ergot intoxication something: Maybe low-dose Covid infection causes delirium. like watching outbreak mass psychosis. Toxoplasmosis makes mice stand cats, there's fungus turns ants suicidal zombies. could really stupid? Again? Someone know kinds trips kids. Drove St. Louis, spent week going city never wore mask. got home going public pool, lake, restaurants big party daughter‚Äôs birthday. daughter woke high fever 2 days ago. She‚Äôs genuinely shocked doesn‚Äôt know could gotten sick. think too. area see people socializing without masks regularly. stores it‚Äôs pretty good, outside. Plus people coming camp. Probably latter end needing daycare kids... Well yeah, get put position saving cost *other* people's lives, fair. beginning think plan allow old sick people (I.e., likely need government assistance) die. get removed books ‚Äúwe‚Äù don‚Äôt need pay anymore. administration makes nauseous. I‚Äôm higher risk dying this? Glass windows block UV rays, make sure open window sometimes obituary said died Covid. posted Facebook tested positive day passed, posted able breathe. Walgreens always follows CVS lol hope political post information sub, cause real concern.

the US coronavirus data managed michael caputo, guy that's putin's payroll decades mentored roger stone. 

This rigged get go. msm covering this?


michael caputo [was picked trump join hhs Assistant Secretary Public Affairs last 

caputo collecting disseminating coronavirus data previously managed CDC.
 . political operative qualified work government administration, nevermind health human services. mentored working roger stone since met jack kemp's campaign.

caputo moved russia 1994 worked advisor pr guru boris yeltsin. takes credit yeltsin winning election.

caputo's big break came 2000, Gazprom hired pr work. Specifically, hired increase putin's public standing approal throught globe, particularly us. 

in 2000 caputo moved palm beach, became tight roger stone worked pr efforts russia/putin's behalf ever since. carl paladino campaign. ukranian politician campaigns...

in 2014 trump hired caputo manage astroturfing campaign boost trump's chance winning bid buffalo bills. 

in 2016, offices ny, miami moscow, caputo joined trump primary campaign.

later, june 2016, fired trump campaign paul manafort joined campaign manager.

then, caputo got drawn russia investigation/mueller investigation coordinated efforts roger stone outreach russia wikileaks. Congestion/runny nose rare symptom covid. covid cases congestion.

You get tested. mean, look good reporting many cases deaths. country whose authorities dishonestly want look good would avoid testing report lower numbers real, give impression managing things well. Win what? winning you? world divided? breathing air kill according random Huntington Beach Karen [but thought shit Wanna know works local Walmart? take they're inside. Also: body like 30 % alcohol point. Looks like hasn‚Äòt sober weeks Tried ford river, lost oxen wagon swept away killed bunch innocent settlers river proclaiming crossing great success. Sorry time something black brown people. Lol That's one unpleasant comment section. wants best... catching spreading covid. preferred labs located somewhere Gulf Mexico. Throw test samples water, current take free charge. read Jose Saramago? kids wearing masks kids going bars kids catching it. retroactively fixes that. bad news - disease around since earlier year. goes sells beans That‚Äôs fact. Non-western countries (e.g. Russia) covering data big time. Trump every single one supporters share one universal trait: think know better everyone else. Remember months ago people saying shouldn‚Äôt wear mask (without valid reason)? wonder now. assume means really attractive professional. Fuck Florida 300,000 confirmed cases?? 

I checked old source used time NJ NY bad, find NJ dropped 5th total cases. second months. FL catching NY. 

Damn tables turn. 

Now course many undiagnosed cases don‚Äôt know even knows would look like - FL could still lot worse even could somehow count those. ppl wear masks basic intelligence understand logic. commend attempt, idiots continue idiots. worked gun violence... know you‚Äôre troll, that‚Äôs flat curve. 

That‚Äôs clear increase may may plateau coming weeks.  much loss business... perhaps temporary ban premises? missing year education catastrophic. Sweden kept primary schools open EU countries planning return full normalcy next year. keeping schools shut nothing make U.S. epidemics resolve quicker, given appalling social conditions U.S. non-existent public health institutions. get real. lot people working every job tell miserable. lot people like earn living. haven‚Äôt even hit Friday yet, usually ends highest numbers week... oof, looking forward figures tomorrow ü§¢

but encountered one study COVID testicles: number came Department Provincial Administration themselves, summarized midnight new year eve announce every year. Good. responsibility falls him. Fucking idiot. forget big truck round illegal immigrants himself!

Yup, said that. I'm American (embarrassed since 2016) &amp; agree completely. can't understand either. young son asked several times many without masks. tell must believe understand science. (OR absolute insanity)? 
I went hiking empty trail, mask on, people gathered rest mountain area driven to, watching kids group sports summer camp activities. mask one them! Standing shoulder shoulder, talking, spitting, sneezing, etc. 
I'm immunocompromised people's choice wear masks severely limits go. 
I agree Americans look totally crazy. choice wear mask point insane behavior. I'm sorry leave world way taking care people refuse help other. sorry family friends robbed time together. hurts heart. Rest peace. Uh, know that... period president bit death sentence... would scary point history Coop know person mentally ill drugs what. Hindsight 20/20 person got stabbed could easily died. sister nurse told man either PCP manic episode. took 6 security guards take down. might think pepper spray works people like guaranteed. someone came knife bet life pepper spray would completely disable them. Drugs make someone really strong. moment officer information. Honestly taser would helpful here, I'm sure available. college friend schizophrenic episode murdered woman. came cops knife. tased that's he's alive today. know circumstances could option. pepper spray, think so. person weapon. fool knife deadly someone die it. definitely kill someone. 

I think would help public little educated self defense firearms training, I'm hearing things thread like ""shoot leg"" ""the man stabbed die guy murderer"" ""pepper spray used crazy/coked person coming knife."" public understand lot this, wonder would risk life acess gun situations. officer becomes incapacitated firearm fair game. makes situation dangerous live country loves guns everyone armed, can't remove guns police. would systematically remove guns population next 15 years. Everyone thinks they're expert. invite someone advanced training tell I'm wrong, totally open changing mind particular situation. love/hate tagged [USA] lmfao Unfortunately lot doctors (that routine care outside Covid care) losing lot money right they‚Äôre demanding things patients wouldn‚Äôt bottom line wasn‚Äôt priority. ID docs ones guiding care every hospital's Covid Care. might specialties front, picture. Unfortunately, also types already lots kids would wear mask could thwart evil plan. right, serious part.

Sorry, early pre coffee. Fauci admitted lied this. got yesterday dude store wearing mask. employees say anything did. like 2-3 thousand total cases still focusing this? That‚Äôs true. spitting someone considered assault, severe charge intentionally dismissing mask prevent highly transmissible virus? Punctuation friend like that, biggest sheep here. Don‚Äôt reproduce staffed nurses physicians? Isolation droplet protocols standard concept medical profession. comes think virus hoax. Still. sounds like he‚Äôs trying purge Florida it‚Äôs elderly. We‚Äôve already chosen wear masks now, literally pointless Anyone shred dignity common sense left white house long time ago. Except thing, devoted whole life to, happening absolutely Zero federal interest stop it? one two weeks control data. thing clear cut, trump wants everything go back normal, people alive dead. doesn‚Äôt care anything anymore, wants economy function even handicap take chance. can‚Äôt blame Russia. that. battle workers people hoarding gross amounts wealth, also courting fascism white supremacy. saying it‚Äôs Putin diminishes scope conflict here. new information.

Or fact Virginia longer seeing decline cases? wonder currently possible test immunity SARS cov 2 externally.

SARS v1 much deadly term fatality rate, want given virus test theory. ok us ignore Whitehouse point. keep Fauci. call opposite fear mongering?   


Because that's exactly what's happening right now. America time gain back rights somehow, value freedom much right witness little it. something, please... Let specify, customer cause disruption refuses wear mask store, banned specific store globally. customer wear mask yells government stupid nonsense, already put EVERYONE within building risk. want serious, also fined they're it. one thing forget mask, another literally go without mask cause problems. businesses follow, one business allows customer use money put people risk, we're enabling stupid behavior. 


You'd surprised, position competitive even co-workers allow customers go without mask means making sale. insane. made jingle faux PSA another would stop people wearing masks, fuck it, get fired get unemployment, doesn‚Äôt sound worst agree you. Hope didn‚Äôt imply would forced military healthcare workers.. meant offered use first others Yeah. Americans fat fuck. Well, anyway. far, says doesn‚Äôt know contracted virus doesn‚Äôt believe contagious Saturday. 

He can't *know* that. ashamed.

July 12th: Photo Taken

July 15th: Announcement positive Covid-19 test results *slight symptoms*.

Incubation Period 2 14 days.

Yup. Math adds up. Definitely contagious definitely worth publishing private schedule good may come contact with. *cough* riots *cough* There‚Äôs local family whose 35 year old husband ventilator two weeks beginning virus. wife daughter positive asymptomatic. posted update yesterday, three month anniversary husband released hospital. severe PTSD, severe pain ears, dizziness, migraines GI issues. asymptomatic wife daughter developed celiac disease, GI issues severe migraines. medical bills currently millions, max pocket year. husband can‚Äôt work, living teachers salary she‚Äôs going go back work August. People acting like symptoms go away. don‚Äôt. might eventually, one knows. insane plow ahead one knows anything virus. can't stop states reporting individually, though - thankfully. would him. He‚Äòll know exactly are, feel everything else matter months! /s case. also since majority think like use FB, twitter, Instagram TikTok.   something forgotten, totally right. mild cases provide immunity everyone. lucky easy case once. vector friend sister got years later. neighbor twice, second time much worse.

We know antibody response seemingly varies among individuals limited testing we've done. small majority teachers parents 

So words people? It‚Äôs South... reddit! we're wishing shit exist, want pill lets eat whatever want without gaining weight. maybe flying carpet. sweet unicorn ride sunset. It‚Äôs sad happening now, July. state, it‚Äôs mandatory stores since March. No, doesn‚Äôt absolve him.  wouldn‚Äôt call whataboutisn though. I‚Äôm looking reality situation. Fuck Trump goddamn y'all post bullshit every thread. horse dead. stop [Serious]: come business even open right except hospitals essential ones? serious grand scheme things. Smoking, obesity, alcohol, hard drugs, etc killing people year year year. things could prevented mostly people turn heads way instead getting involved. ludicrous 2/3rds country overweight obese. get high horse go get involved issues actually care people.

You really though, want feel superior someone else realistic fake moral outrage. zzZZzZzz Plato wrote allegory cave, description pandemic bad epistemology currently face. People live ""cave"" want see light - intense, jarring, experts shadows cave, invested it. seem clumsy, stumbling talk ""sunlight"" ""open skies"", eyes adjusted experience reality.

You cannot force light, cannot berate, cannot insult intelligence (however tempting may be, however deserving may be).

You can, patient, draw light see themselves. all, learn best - told is, someone guides making discovery own? Yes. definitely. Leadership country needs. But, damn, executive order brutal morally wrong hope haunts life. Sacrificing vulnerable population like preserve hospital beds brutal. Actually yeah, lot people think ""just flu"". Let‚Äôs forget thousands avoidable nursing home deaths occurred Cuomo ordered nursing homes take back residents still COVID make room ICUs... makes choice easier God role model downplays everything that's going like normal ""has happen"" countries reopening barely single digit numbers zero deaths skyrocketing higher ever daily basis, acts like seen countries strategies mask wearing work almost everywhere medical community known common sense hundred years somehow masks become ""unproven science voodoo"" People don‚Äôt get sick immediately HIV. takes while. Usually six months immune system get destroyed opportunistic infections start showing up. 

So six months it, one idea fatal disease. Yup, I‚Äôve telling everyone entire time, pretty much since happened Ohio went ran completely wrong direction think main long term impact increased remote work meaning fewer people commuting car. might nice knock effects like Big Oil investing renewables search profits... 

On hand, couple years economic growth post covid could wipe gains made. real hope we've learned something importance collective action face global catastrophe... One dream. worry, take kid Disney World, probably parents much longer wonder Covid19 fond US state leadership doesn‚Äôt take stand many schools reopen in-person, despite technical flexibility proposing roadmap reopening. basically body tries save ass sacrificing himself, ironic.

But that's immun system works, hope really get asap vaccine... Wait min, hold on, sec requiring ppl wear whole time???? 5 year old wears mask without problem. complaint thinks makes look like ""dork"" FDA looked way CDC sent contaminated test kits month? TBH really don‚Äôt understand anyone surprised. not? believe Sweden much stricter rules, preferably lockdown similar countries southwest Europe.

As said before, please show defend strategy adapted Sweden. so, stop trying tell others think. Grow should, large corporations know economy better shape everyone wears mask. I'm glad see pushing back Trump administration power numbers. would vaccine available average US citizen? Maybe they're usually insane? Attention spans fit 2 extremes now. 

Nuance dead gone. Idiocracy full effect. Yes standing saying mandatory shaming anyone them. like 100 years ago help. shocked enough infections groups reach statistical significance October

They're trying push forward human challenge trials run parallel phase 3. fauci class act person trust national disaster Microbiologist Didier Raoult influential, would numerous trials HCQ regardless Trump.

But really wish fraction effort invested ivermectin.   champions 
We champions 
No time losers 
'Cause champions world!!! - Q plot twist. herd immunity kicks election day urban areas much better Georgia think major pharmacies would've done day one. But... 'Murica. Thanks. Wasn‚Äôt crying bullshit. I‚Äôm Canada mAsKs uNConsitUtIOnaL

LOL U go gym still? RIP bro last time school? think surprised great things happening public schools. super rich thought well cause lose money since many wealth form real estate. market crash, hard. That's like sending tax return Federal Government expecting IRS charge failure file. like battleship going infested enemy waters full submarines. they, unfortunately, decided take sonar disarm obvious threat lurks rational battleships keep sonar stay armed sailing away threat see clearly front them. üòÇ Murca!

http://archive.vn/OPeVu#selection-515.175-519.204 dunno, man. satire Republicans funny. sound like kind person feels urge say ""all lives matter"". too. department store since February. recent trip Trader Joes good experience. Limited number store. Everyone masks. Constant cleaning. bagged groceries. bad closet one 1.5 hrs away. Don‚Äôt living patients pay better dead ones? need wait placebo group hits threshold infections show vaccine effective.

They're gearing full blown challenge trial run parallel phase 3. Sounds like she‚Äôs volunteering everyone else‚Äôs family Yes. Still, good get outside even little while. surprised. Laymen arguing thread could made better decisions back March. Give break. noted initial vote date coincided 150th anniversary Vladimir Lenin's birth.

I'm beginning think there's something burying memorial.  Lockdown 2.0 baby CVS offering free. Cuomo didn't... kept telling us stay strong listen CDC Anyone doubt approved regardless results? can't even date girl whose name Karen lol. Ibeen invested meme far long Something sit right. day tweets coronavirus conspiracy, son gets coronavirus? second tweet said ""To clarify add perspective..."". Sounds like sarcastic first tweet tone mistaken? adult response issue. unfortunately Trumpster child never understand humans vs virus, human vs human vs virus. suppose analogous ""shot"" U.S. Unless British also say receiving injection ""getting shot."" exact frustration. Journalism country become far political devisive. 

NBC thing yesterday posted video report stating Israel experienced huge spike opened schools. problem Israeli interviewed spoke everything opened back rush, schools... absurd things twisted whatever current political argument. And, creating huge amount confusion issue needs simplified framed science.

Progressives used value intellectuals, happened?! Oh I'm preparing worst hoping best. Surviving form? lung scarring potentially lead pulmonary fibrosis, brain inflammation, barely good news. People going dying even vaccine. Yeah kinda fucked worry needing mask first. mask use told help lower spread least 2 months now..so really excuse. Science evolves. perfect. Don‚Äôt worry, they‚Äôre making $30,000 putting false positive covid patients ventilators, apparently. least that‚Äôs coworker‚Äôs Facebook post freedomeagle.com says. side note, I‚Äôve recently stopped talking best work friend. Experts think people Japan common cold recently New York, Western Europe, Wuhan? Seems questionable. True, think fair position company, consistent Costco's MO. 

They pay store employees fairly well compared major retailers, together come store, people HQ show solidarity store employees that, making sacrifice success, same. 

Even someone MBA making $400k/year, still part labor class since selling labor (their knowledge business administration) owners capital (the stockholder CostCo) even make substantially money store employees. Tell Google covid drive thru test sites near me. That's morning appointment 2 hours sick March ""recovered"" lot current symptoms listed. ~10% reduction overall lung capacity extreme fatigue normal tasks (ie cook dinner tired eat after). I'm still 20 lbs (6'0"" 135 currently).

Blood results ""normal"", getting CT scan lungs couple months. It‚Äôs tragedy one people would fight workers rights won‚Äôt get chance Oval Office. Western Cape resting reporting. rest country reporting accurately. western cape seen ‚Äúwhite‚Äù area reporting large number people areas, make us look bad. SA making white people look bad, stealing background. Ministers got caught stealing food parcels starving people. It‚Äôs reporting large numbers certain areas SA,white areas, whole SA trust say government doesn‚Äôt think like normal people. motive discredit white people hide flaws. yes testing countries also putting ‚ÄúCOVID‚Äù COD majority death certificates it‚Äôs easier. it‚Äôs finding cheapest easiest way trying steal much possible blaming everything white people apartheid. older generation black people ( actually lived apartheid) said lives better racist oppressive regime ‚Äúfree democratic SA‚Äù. think speaks volumes pathetic government is. many better drugs could tested problem. used grocery store cashier 4 years went teaching. I'm well aware essential workers deal right now. school district came plan days ago. Luckily masks mandatory long state mask mandate effect, way they‚Äôre everything else pissing off.

They offering online schooling, unenroll school enroll virtual school, run third party company. I‚Äôm high school senior, shitty thing enroll virtual school year, won‚Äôt able walk class graduation/graduate high school, technically aren‚Äôt student school anymore.

I‚Äôm willing sacrifice lot senior year, prom, senior trip, whatever. graduating class? Fuck that. lot us also relying things like Beta Club National Honors Society scholarships. can‚Äôt unenroll school without losing huge chunk money college, quite literally can‚Äôt afford that.

Like great job offering virtual school, wow really poor execution. don‚Äôt want sacrifice health, year critical school year terms future. start applying college weeks, I‚Äôd lose much enrolling virtual school. regular employee. sincerely fear people.  divided. need hold accountable. Fuck them. comes immune protesters families. Nah bet everyone else‚Äôs üí© ü§£ Really bad allergies. one common cold, coronavirus family. new flu strain one every year.  Companies even public campaigns fed notion. Type 1 recall seeing campaign Philadelphia ""hold sugar"" billboards kids eating donut underneath adult body injecting insulin. remember Crossfit whole Coke=Diabetes campaign taking picture CGM shooting straight 80 drinking Coke show Coke saved ass countless times.

It infuriates make fun DIABEETUS take lightly. Imagine us cracking jokes chronic conditions like cancer, heart disease, depression?

Yes? real numbers get suppressed federal take data, go happily living lives without fear. hope economy get back business usual. shit show response this. I've calling Trump Trucks, personally live Northern New England much like live, many cases. people hear wear masks works. Things bit restricted, example restaurants take half people hotels need sign health waivers people normal stuff except real travel course. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* U guys quiet heroes. decent research mask composition effectiveness? example, neck gaiter used mask vs one standard blue surgical masks? would assume someone works sales ""sharp"" anything deceit?  Imma sit keep washing hands barista's gofundme still active? surprised true mortality totals nearing 15k right Florida. starts letter C rhymes hunt?  Better late never, suppose...? *unfortunately live EU cannot sell season pass Corona virus due Ban sales* makes good deal difference. Clinicians testing people return might second infection think it‚Äôs possible. People behaving reinfection recrudescence happening, don‚Äôt know. mention China already injecting 2 million soldiers. saying vaccine approved even though effectively phase III.  happy read agree. people around agree opening up? Maybe shield old frail rest go lives? look around reddit see many favour masks discussions logical thinking emotional arguments I'm killing grandma. also America itself? remember quite shocked Bernie lost reddit favour seemed could lose, might something similar happening here. Definitely government conspiracy tho /s President Sunlight Injection still holds spot prime example, though. doomsday scenario either feel little sad looking neighbors Finland Norway seeing country 10 times many deaths combined? Chocolate Bundt? Isn‚Äôt guy said 2 biological sexes think looking for: ""In United States law, depraved-heart murder, also known depraved-indifference murder, type murder individual acts ""depraved indifference"" human life act results death, despite individual explicitly intending kill."" don‚Äôt HR boss know, told coworker sick. worst truth I‚Äôm pretty sure reason said people shouldn‚Äôt wear masks shortage masks medical professionals need them. 


Notice insult call name obviously pressured say masks helpful. definitely said that, everything else discounted. far reliable anything comming USA government point , would agree? far, lot unknowns vaccines, considering recent studies suggest antibodies wear little 3 months. unlikely we'll get adequate data durability year, world better chances shots goal Yeah, care anymore. We're fucked worst people gonna ones suffering. It'll good folks hospitals, people struggling feed families, kids forced go school No, kept extending unemployment. Actions based science often times short sighted fail recognize long term ramifications consequences. good start consider science based actions, thoroughly thought deeper ramifications mind. think downloaded Oblivion. said weaponized virus would much deadlier current version now. likely Corona virus would base weapon several diseases much deadly.

 much easier blame another human accept fact nature totally indifferent us surviving species Yes want something like done, contact representatives federal, state, local. either! called IRS told wait... Unfortunately would require someone Texas governor‚Äôs office actually think shutdown reopening plans, instead flipping quarter ‚Äúopen‚Äù written one side ‚Äúclosed‚Äù other. respiratory viruses spread better winter, that‚Äôs case COVID oh boy trouble.

International Association Providers What's ""second wave"" hear much about? mentioned absolute certainty? due changing social behavior, altering virus itself? Honestly, would net benefit world give vaccine research Ugh, hate you. Angry upvote. wish born decades earlier I'd dead time climate change ravishes earth. We're storm; everyone's got different boat. nieces nephews going back school there's 

I really want go back in-person instruction fall, admin seems sticking minimum partial reopen, online classes *and* face-to-face classes, I'm looking hallways, elevators, classrooms, stairwells... there's way hell contain stuff school, especially without *any* windows open. math spring, ""large lecture"" room, we'd cut 80 students ~20 able maintain safe distancing. class 15 students; can't class typical room without violating distance.

There safe way return in-person instruction fall. serious? Probably team staged moon landing, experience large scale psyops. They‚Äôve training 60 years fuck Trump. Putting aside identified rioters arrested rioting, would say anyone takes deliberate action likely infect innocent 3rd parties resulting death charged. I‚Äôd like hear say. feel like I‚Äôm crazy too- many aren‚Äôt taking seriously. Another pandemic solved put rest u/Patridile. Checker Walmart asked remove mask verify ID. refused, grumbled saying could refuse sell completed transaction anyway. places given one disposable mask day put brown paper bag uses. masks supposed thrown away patients, reused. one exactly that. maybe two weeks ago man tried come without mask; one employees stopped him. started arguing her, cop entrance came handled it. Sorry can't hear muzzle on, SHEEPLE Way go Walmart cousin lives Florida he's part problem. went multiple bars parties videos posted, one wearing masks. 

I would respect Government accepts blame rather shifts someone else. State federal government act like Adult Toddlers throwing tantrums Lying attempt avoid consequence

And honestly, I'd personally probably risk going doctor get kid chickenpox vaccine right there's chance they'd exposed children (no responsible parent would send kid school/daycare right now), leave house twice month, long sleeves, slacks, mask neoprene driving gloves nitrile gloves (even heat index 112F outside), decontaminate immediatly upon returning home. risk breaking isolation far greater infected isolation. even know science anyway? /s dependent? even private.

The difference action Governor Cuomo Governor DeSantis explains result

NY shut two months, controlled pandemic here. mostly dealing people arriving outside NY State COVID19.

Florida refused shut down, refused even ask people wear masks, basically went full Trumpist denial, shit sandwich served.

I think national shut order, areas country controlled pandemic, not. fully support federal government setting standards mandating closure states meet standards.

but would require replacing President Trump President Cuomo (or Biden guess) tomorrow, since otherwise national leadership crisis hold election fall. Something, something, dark state.

Just copy link open private browser, incognito, etc... havent following things while. safer same?

Here Netherlands people taking seriously. one wears mask unless public transport people generally dont care 1.5 distance. Heck people company encouraging work office even sat front table meeting. moved away laughed asked ""Does corona scare you?""

They told watch news things whole lot better now. 

And comments like really disgust feel way Trader Joe's! start pandemic, would go every two weeks, chose one store, Trader Joe's. limits items helped lines get hand sanitizer door made feel better. Masks required awhile though. 

I say, least area, going Target lot lately Walmart twice. bad all, scared go stores. Walmart line let people people go out, one way aisles, times I've gone, felt okay there. Target seem encourage social distancing much, go self check clean station use it. go early enough Target Walmart, really bad, could local stores this. again, like said, masks mandated awhile helps too. Worth noting people

I'd also like see stats 20% hospitalization rate. ever actually looked tiny dime is?

How people keep things? [It didn‚Äôt unite country anti-maskers last don‚Äôt disagree requiring masks save lives, country full heavily armed morons really put employees risk.  can't think that! Early May? Disgusting.

I get angry everyday this.So much idea getting back normal whatever hell is. can't even get people get vaccinated things already vaccine for. guarantee, day vaccine comes out, anti-vax community start spreading bullshit autism mind control whatever new 5G crap think up. Also like putting condom balls. Best Buy's area still curbside. shut fuck man, disgusting see yankees praising fucking cartels time sub. 60% Harris Teeter employees one go wearing masks improperly. also saw girl working starbucks counter pull mask lean talk customer wearing mask. girl working starbucks counter even wearing mask. people shame using grubhub pandemic. understanding hospitalizations slowing running space. take severe symptoms send marginal folks back home. know Houston major issues getting people admitted due lack staffing. seem like positive sold as.  I've decided typical American frankly terrible math, basically incapable critical thinking. American hurts admit that. We've turned country take data process headline length chunks. matters, live? states hit hard already got hit hard trying recover, store manager needs prosectuted opinion. heinous behavoir. Yes, are. That's issue. issue safely safety measures going funded. Also teacher idea difficult implementing measures be. Ask install glass walls trucks start driving suburbs. Game changes week. Something tells teachers willing return aren‚Äôt ones taking things seriously either.. Curious July 4th surge coming. 

July 4th + 7 days symptoms + 5 days gets bad go ER call ambulance. Yeah, definitely smaller grocery stores disadvantage. said, I'm pretty confident could get level online presence less month (and probably week, push come shove). Like said, grocery stores somewhat unique problem diversified inventory constantly changing (due supply issues vendors). think solve things:

1. Limit inventory available online store. there's something constantly fluctuates, list online. Stick listing stuff that's available 90% time.
2. Hire employee dedicated listing/updating product. Yes, people cost money. Add 5 cents every item listed, make money time. even charge $5 courtesy fee top something.
3. Shopper communication. like Shipt delivery services, there's ""the list"", shopper actually picks up. use Shipt, I'd say 50% order ends getting resized, swapped, canceled, etc. That's get people ordering stuff always listed.
4. Use existing solution. software/services set days, get store started. store hiring someone specifically build store them, going take forever.

Coming tech industry, want say EASY problem solve (it's not), ways cut scope solution way possible get something going month less. sounds like wife's store ran combination management trying build WAY comprehensive solution, contractor that's willing keep taking money build something larger need. I'll simply apply FML time runs out, schools closed again.

I read as, ""I'll simply apply fuck life time runs out, schools closed again"" think still works out. You‚Äôre impressive. know everything history you‚Äôre disease expert. Good job man non stop funnel players thier answer. player dies.
This like Runningman! Think whatever want Fauci, wear mask. camps even open.

this say ""Lots young people get covid - 72 NFL"" 

they're greater restrictions rest us right now.

&amp;#x200B;

camps start soon, they're getting tested be.. MLB NBA huge deal, continue see numbers high.

&amp;#x200B;

But estimating 32 traditional 90-man training camp rosters would give number 2,880 total NFL players moment, means 72 **represent 2.5% league's player population.**

&amp;#x200B;

US roughly 1% infected.. younger people ones getting now.. big deal teams/league maybe, ""worse"" NFL compared not. Right, $16 plenty me. lived paycheck paycheck years I‚Äôm outside Sacramento generally ‚Äúred‚Äù county, may explain things. I‚Äôm always masked up, months, used receive quite bit eye rolls it‚Äôs gotten better. true. lot people inside outside US actually believed recommended wear masks. position authority maintain level trust. That's public expects doctor. review appealed, reviewed. Still nothing wrong did. twat... understand legal footing thinks has. ever makes court, hope defense able get people donated sign petition donated money barista, her. Saw day bus stop. best part sun, sneezed, saw full cloud splash everywhere.

I don‚Äôt understand people clueless.   Gotta remember still states like mine mask mandate certainly help! Yeah agree stay hopeful. even get started weird vaccine hate  mandate masks, went Walmart without one medicine makes money sickness, including vaccine companies. anti-vaxxers vaccine companies make money sickness? No, shouldn‚Äôt. Hope so, didn‚Äôt work Costco doubt it‚Äôll work Walmart target guess area country (US) live I've working retail pandemic even one incident someone wearing mask. Saw one dude wearing shirt said ""the MEDIA VIRUS"" even wearing mask. Yep. think movies take place early 2020's, necessarily pandemic, use actors wearing masks show time period. Kind like Stranger Things Reagan re-election signs lawns (and plenty mid-80s stuff). That‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying though. shut whole country March New York New Jersey really bad. lot places hit hard right weren‚Äôt really bad time could‚Äôve probably contained virus phase 1 2 approach limiting capacity closing high risk businesses.

Instead panicked shut everything destroyed economies areas didn‚Äôt need destroy economies. sit 4 months later really need shut states like Florida, Texas, Arizona people don‚Äôt want lock-in many cases can‚Äôt afford lock again.

Now actually shut everything stayed shut longer, like 8-10 weeks completely starved virus yeah, agree shutdown best idea. since half shutdown, think should‚Äôve done prescribed half shutdowns states afford shut needed. area it‚Äôs free free. places go pay test go pay rapid results major testing centers free. company want us confronting anyone regarding masks. even mandate, pointless. company also afraid standing customers Gotta alive buy stuff  First thing build wall us Zimbabwe Store policy leads people throwing tantrums store employees getting hurt. It‚Äôll probably take security enforce it. Look videos people losing mask Costco Walmart ghetto fuck. nasty People even listening *now.* But... 4 months late. vote content, username OP shit illegal? become zombies eat human flesh, you‚Äôll let us know right? Fist all, aware anecdotal irrefutable evidence going doctor 100% safe. attempting let someone know going doctor mean definitively fucked. Sometimes comforting hear people similar situation made situation unharmed. 

 Second all, yes, two weeks ago; yes, taken *two* tests come back negative. yes yes. 

 Third, Really? Comments sub quite bit different comments article. live two different worlds admission criteria change? clear, ‚Äúwalked back‚Äù editorial language media put new statement. still pro opening schools, clarified safely. common sense.  inside ANYWHERE that's house act eating drinking distance need mask virus least pressing matter. going forward, US need wear masks feel sick anyway. Sigh, miss lockdown traffic volumes... always see lone white fat fuck refuses wear mask walmart.  Let eat cake. 

No fridge bailouts stupid states please. Thanks. problem fuck USPS scaring old rural voters, they'll make impossible lot turn ballots rural votes vital them. sounds like badly organized restaurant  Mask requirement isn‚Äôt enforceable practical way Disney experience.

At times, still struggles catch breath, lingering condition. marvels able survive.

‚ÄúIt time.‚Äù

Editor‚Äôs note: account combination Chronicle‚Äôs translation Erika Carlos Tatiana Sanchez 17-page journal Arias wrote Spanish abridged English translation. journal entries edited length clarity. local hospitals big laboratories reported inaccurate data like this, labs like Quest Diagnostic fall list. They‚Äôre positivity rate 100% reality, 25% cases positive.

&amp;#x200B;

instead focusing numeric percentage.. agree high? 

and high bad?

&amp;#x200B;

fixing error numbers mean ICU patients suddenly get go home.

**Florida hospitals face ICU bed shortage state passes 300,000 COVID-19 mean? Execution? Exile? do? said wrong. sound crazy. tells need know crowd Yes. Everything disagree hidden cabal pushing propaganda. explanation. fault goes way back, systemic failure education imo, lot deep complicated reasons.

Snap get rid Trump tomorrow, still 60 million idiots voted him. 50% wearing masks lot better 0% wearing masks though? Amazon, get KN95, N95 made China. Look vendor good customer reviews recent. Shipping much faster couple months ago. Ha! Im waiting fall. Stock slowly, going hell ride spare stock canned goods I'm sure backs blue, right? Hypocritical idiots. 5 person drop.

Or put another way, 0.05% drop. article hit paywall:

Surely, Rafael Arias thought, must spicy fish rice he‚Äôd eaten day before. 42-year-old Oakland restaurant worker could think reason suddenly feeling ill.

It late March, novel coronavirus begun take hold Bay Area. March 22, day Arias felt first symptoms, California postponed jury trials, Hayward opened free drive-by testing site, Alameda County, 100 cases reported, announced first COVID-19 death. week before, Oakland restaurant Arias worked barback closed doors.

As fever, aches confusion worsened, Arias sensed might virus. decided begin chronicling days handwritten journal, memorialize believed might descent death.

Researchers Johns Hopkins University estimate 545,000 people United States recovered bouts coronavirus. suffering worst cases frequently intubated placed medically induced comas. survive, wake remembering weeks immune systems battled keep alive.

Not Arias.

With health insurance alone home, spent weeks fighting life, sometimes hallucinating gasping air. nearly it, conscious, remembering every painful detail.

‚ÄúI alone, nobody talk do,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúI fighting coronavirus myself, ideas.‚Äù

His handwritten journal would fill 17 pages. shared Chronicle, along abridged English translation letter wrote God family thought near death. also spoke detail reporter travails provided tour 558-square-foot house battle virus took place.

What follows Rafael Arias‚Äô account painful journey, words.

‚ÄòI could sleep even hour‚Äô

A week shelter-in-place order Gov. Gavin Newsom, stressed-out Arias walks Oakland home Eastmont Mall nearby marina relax. must food poisoning last night‚Äôs dinner, thinks, sweats uncontrollably. appetite. Tylenol briefly eases headache. begins record experience red spiral notebook.

Sunday, March 22. eat something, feel nauseous pain starts front head. go sleep, can‚Äôt it. feel uncomfortable. sweating without logical explanation, still pay much attention wouldn‚Äôt traumatize myself, since much news television causing harm. took 600mg ibuprofen. hours kept passing condition improving all. worried bit. wanted throw up, since hadn‚Äôt eaten anything, nothing throw up.

Monday, March 23. feel discomfort body something happening inside me. watched television without paying attention it, waiting 8 p.m. take next pair Tylenol pills. 500mg it, possible calm pain around three hours. started worry more. took pills flu, thinking might getting flu, wasn‚Äôt so. night arrived, things got worse.

Tuesday, March 24. could sleep even hour. made decision see doctor getting control. thought eaten something bad state. gave medication went house. started take medicine, reality help all. headache even intense, temperature started increase more, point needing place wet rags head belly help go little. symptoms began: pain bones, weakness, lack coordination, blurry vision, anxiety, lack breathing. Telemundo, saw Hayward coronavirus tests, decided go following day.

‚ÄòThings cannot get worse‚Äô

As symptoms worsen, Arias spends day bed. plans drive coronavirus testing station. wonders: Could virus?

Wednesday, March 25. Things cannot get worse. slept hour changed clothes go take test Hayward. arrived test temperature higher 100. temperature increased more, head pain intense, muscular pain unbearable inability concentrate noticeable hours went by. breathing short difficult every moment. began get scared, panic began take hold me. wanted go bathroom unable open door. felt lost.

As night fell, torment began. pain much way able calm pain take bath leave current hot water head around 30 minutes.

I felt outside myself, me. looked like going faint stop breathing ‚Äî didn‚Äôt know would happen first. Fortunately, none happened. pills literally boiling water, able overcome difficult situation literally killing me.

‚ÄòTemperature high, pain indescribable‚Äô

It‚Äôs week symptoms hit, food water blazing temperature reaching 104 degrees, Arias begins hallucinating. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd close eyes see fire I‚Äôd walking around fire I‚Äôd hear voices different languages. animals dirty water sharks. big tall people walking around me. felt real. could feel fire burn skin.‚Äù journal, scribbles wrong days week. bed, cries clutching photograph deceased parents. calls 911 summon paramedics, barely able punch numbers phone.

Thursday, March 26. Sixth day symptoms. Friday, Holy God, can‚Äôt believe day went through. longer knew felt moment. didn‚Äôt even know do, felt like praying talking God ‚Äî solution. talked God arrived peace him. asked forgiveness everything told ready ‚Äî moment, accepted it, wasn‚Äôt going let go hand. wanted keep fighting know how. running hope. seems like something overpowering telling stop fighting, want give up. breathing improving. something covering mouth letting pull air.

Friday, March 27. Nothing improved, still. temperature high, pain indescribable ‚Äî someone pricking needles turning around head. metallic worms walking inside head. Faith thing keeps strong fighting everything. looked like virus capacity break spirit turn vulnerable. don‚Äôt want talk anyone. It‚Äôs you‚Äôd simply want end.

I decided call emergency services, prepare mentally. say goodbye mind family friends, apologize God. put cozy clothes write letter. Everything wrong, everything. totally misplaced. tongue white someone painted brush, eyes lost, lips starting turn blue.

The ambulance arrived personnel talked me. mentioned taken coronavirus test still results. paramedic recommended don‚Äôt go hospital, wasn‚Äôt sick, would be, since already lot sick people chaos go there.

They left got house one time, alone, symptoms maximum level. body jumping ‚Äî think called spasms.

I already giving up, want fight more. It‚Äôs faith disappearing moment. Even so, wish lose battle, drank water abundance. Night came, without able sleep, desire fight this.

‚ÄòI decided fight‚Äô

As illness worsens, breathing stops long intervals, seven 10 seconds. stumbles aimlessly tiny house, unable find room. moments despair, kneels floor, arms stretched air, pleads: ‚ÄúGod, help me!‚Äù

Saturday, March 28. I‚Äôm sweating time. feet hurt, can‚Äôt step ground feel someone biting nails. feel fatal. lost hope. said goodbye relatives apologized God. ready die. breath really short bad degree cannot yawn sleepy. slept 6 days. eaten nothing.

The symptoms getting worse advantage. ate quesadilla. advantage eat without hunger. Everything remained stable. Maybe didn‚Äôt feel well least getting worse made feel good. asked God let go help me. decided fight let defeated.

Sunday, March 29. Problems breathing, decided go clinic see doctor could give something respiratory problems. arrived space, returned house kept fighting hand. symptoms began lower intensity. Breathing worrying. still received results COVID-19 test. waiting anxiety. zero chance we'll see NFL playing games eight weeks. Wait, access hospital restricted? 

I'm Sweden hospitals closed Covid triage triage Emergency cases outside tents. local health clinics security also door check temperatures symptoms allowed appointment Covid symptom free. mean, two months. Throughout January til around March, US sitting around watching nations getting ravaged virus never imagining would next. nothing prepare, nothing prevent, nothing educate general public; hell even take seriously. federal government utterly failed us, I'm convinced number additional months would've enough get US prepared. time need, complete shift attitude (which think happen elect new president replace current IMPOTUS...) like see someone else got horrible disease? Seriously, fuck!? ignorant tweet got lot attention idiot chief retweeted it. eat crow everyone praising fact son got it: ""karma!"" ""I hope genome dies"" ""now that's pure gold"" ""lol"" ""fuck piece shit"". know ""celebrating wishing someone's illness"" lack amount humanity made tweet. Y'all hateful-ass motherfuckers!!! say mobility scooters, saw any? mean Putin better country. fact, sounds like he's hollowed rest government, hurt country. told back gave rash shit giving madness this.

Pro ti[: start flailing arms wildly. They'll back up, ones learn lesson standing close. helps sing chorus flail arms I'm already basically living wife dogs me. want drop health problems crippling debt? Nah homie I'd rather smoke two joints myself. Check 7-day running average US certainly longer declining. Next weeks tell tale. good? really common ground find majority 'right' though? Truly everything last 4 years, incidents, people still praise republicans, can't even bothered wear mask?

We tired, tried, tried more. common ground, literally fight country survival now. staggeringly ignorant. 80 days hospital? Damn.

Any assessment follow damage? Came say ^ Gotta get staff first. one 10 customers 2 employees wearing one. county mask mandate too. Dying bad economy. Nice foaming mouth democrat politicians think think? Hey it‚Äôs time finally NFL player  didn‚Äôt say antibodies always untraceable certain amount time. said decline unusual.

You definitely many measles antibodies soon vaccinated mean talks long term immunity, immunity disappearing months, scare mongering? Noted, appreciate concern, They'll go streets game recruit people play. said quiet part loud.  DeSantis now. Locally. city, Home Depot definitely require masks. switched loyalty Menards. local HD three weeks ago employee literally told wait could stop seeing sheep wearing little masks. 

I wearing mask. mean public safety linked economy, way dude - Florida man day two Whitehouse reporting numbers CDC... thing going ""disappear"" real fast. Chuck, get virus, too, self promote doing. it. economy needs money turn arounds create. Rush now. mean, trees things realize needed add disclosure said, 'climate permitting' said since live Wisconsin obviously class outside 0 degree day wind-chill -15. root lot problems US, goes back many decades. Freudian slip tongue? connection? mean cases equals deaths? hate get really basic this, average 1.4% people testing positive FL dying.  seeing 1000+ cases day 4+ days without death... means deaths either lagging behind 40-60 so, reported. Honest answer?

They thought hospitals might actually fully overflow capacity happens, actually late make decisions. try empty hospital beds make happen.

And, whether stated not, decided nursing home patients -- average life expectancy slightly 6 months -- could sent back ""home"" (the nursing home) actively require hospital care.

It wrong call, known ahead time. hospitals actually overrun, would right call. We're already seeing effect norovirus. [There 0 outbreaks US first time least 8 I'd wager that, data.

Edit: participating states, whole US. important thing say. Everything else fluff designed give facts good science, manipulate wearing one, help turns really work well community settings, hurt don‚Äôt, people focused mask wearing part instead stay fuck home part. Well, guess I'm corrected :P while. Can‚Äôt straight though like bowl cereal. It‚Äôs thick. like melted milkshake thick. Like drinking loogies thick. Mad son even got tested? pull band-aid cancel - know going happen. Lots Public Freakouts coming  I'd like joke say ""see guys tomorrow"" actually getting quite scary... Tried finish article, ended prematurely. real problem tried take style skillset children's entertainer/educator apply adults. comes across talking everyone. Even he's right (Which good percentage time), adults want talked like children. Ah, correct. bad. seems spread misinformation. main point still correct, appears I'll need research area. semester half college chemistry limited experience chemicals. However, every individual chemical mixture gasses make fart much smaller virus. Viruses also behave gas, even may ""ride"" upon gasses. virus move outward attempt escape container like gas does. information beside point correcting me; wanted restate main point add yet another point whilst acknowledging correction.

Thanks. :) think many people told, ""Touch stove, lose home let children go hungry.""

Fuck selfish, privileged enough stay safe refusing actually it. forget desperate suffering right next them. Probably thinks they'll implant chip sth test. conspiracies went completely apeshit. weird born raised almost 30 years, lived Texas life without ever living Texas. pretty drastic difference Austin, Dallas, Houston places between.  let cure worse disease!!! We‚Äôre Missouri St. Louis area, 60% states cases are. relatively low numbers compared states, doesn‚Äôt make less appalling store manager acted like that. front facing sick people day. plexus-glass shield, mask (at first). finally came around it, damn terrified first month. 

And wife go back office week. works state attorney generals office. aren‚Äôt mandating masks. hand sanitizer stations. AGs Admin (top leaders) walking around respecting distance wife‚Äôs secretaries (who don‚Äôt doors close). She‚Äôs meeting division leaders voice concerns, tons state lawyers staff building filing formal complaints AG many looking jobs it‚Äôs become apparent state leadership busy kissing Trumps ass care threat employees health.   paid $10 blood lab requested antibodies test myself, doctors scrip. don‚Äôt think remainder cost goes private insurance.... I'm calling police maintain safe distancing

And hate throw bad news, I'm assuming referring ""6 feet"", widely understood enough. However, beyond 6 feet compliance drops quickly. 

The 6 feet also understanding, outdoors. Things air going linger indoors, ""safe distance"" schools bit joke factors. (also mention disgusting kids hygiene boundaries) 64?? looked 32. wrong - people taken care access resources need wealthiest country modern history. sites like Chaturbate, name saw written wall somewhere definitely site ever visited. Hate see asshole's son suffer dickbag get karma. Damn time white South African complaining n****** racist POS, swear!  We‚Äôre yet. Cities got hit first, doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôll hit worst. think lighting computer better hookworms /s Yeah i'm tired seeing false argument getting thrown around. Saw guy twitter yesterday talking family member accounted 10 positive cases county cause he's 75 days. Like fuck would know? work health department county? doctor? ANYTHING related medical professional, fucking people amaze me, dumb are. Yes alarming GA even one big 3 hotspots dominating news recently. get dictator another four years?

I'll freely admit next clue American politics, surely elected fixed term still democratic (unless take Roman ""dictat"" approach near unlimited power year) said wrong else do? 3 Hail Marrys? excommunicated life? religious cult guys like this? Dammit. preordered it! Hope get refund. hope term catches gets momentum deserves Literally opposite reality. Stupid ain't sexy, folks! goal seems death. I'm fan Costco Walmart grabbing reins politicians fail. people looking massive failure government. Here's Georgia's latest case/death charts, running appears behind TX/AZ/FL terms deaths. Cases spiked deaths followed suit yet.

Interestingly, Georgia 5 (small rural) counties ranked top-20 counties per capita state still middle 28.80 deaths per 100k population. Yea you‚Äôre probably right. Lol absolutely nothing. said fuck hoped workee bet vaccine might come. Thats think mindset was, vaccine bust. know anyone type study want like meaningless. First specific exact type remote teaching implemented. virtual face face? students able intermingle ONLINE grouped work problems together? constant feedback? easy cheat(like old school cheating rampant?)

The people called research-have ever student USA PUBLIC SCHOOL? state? type learners talking here? students motivated eager learn? educated people contact with? people household able offer assistance?

Are books house? parents read child child yet reader? INCENTIVES child learn anything? punishments child GOOFING OFF? anyone REALLY CARE PUBLIC SCHOOL education first place! Sorry miss something? US 40-60 THOUSAND cases day even mandatory wear mask shopping? cast preview normal day ‚Äú20%‚Äù capacity. hate tell November far far away. Immediate action necessary. opposite - abuse still there, goes undetected schools often identify first signs problem I‚Äôve encountered idiots enough brains share shit ‚Äúseems real‚Äù isn‚Äôt. sharing things like, ‚Äúit isn‚Äôt oxygen levels problem wear mask, carbon dioxide levels.‚Äù video proves nothing them. I'm NVA. notable see someone without mask inside grocery store non-restaurant place business. Yet follow www.covidactnow.org, numbers bode well. Monday, still yellow status meaning virus continues grow spread low controlled rate. Tuesday, orange status makes us risk. last week, infection rate, measure tells many people infected infected person, gone 1.02 1.13. time, contact tracing percentage, measure shows many positive diagnoses contact traced within 48 hours, gone down. showing us infection spreading, ability contact Trace infected people struggling infections go up.

NVA, despite anecdotal report mask compliance, well. large counties red. think return indoor gatherings masks compulsory, like restaurants allowed take mask eat drink, contributing. Living Virginia, know bars. Everything bar restaurant. although bar seating remains closed, restaurants opening live entertainment numerous pictures people inside wearing masks holding cocktail.

North said sometime last week maybe early week schools going able reopen Virginia can't remain phase three. argument right already rolled back phase two given numbers tracking infection severity state county's individual ability deal infection. I'm convinced time next week. Sorry bummer, even better adherence mass rules, appear allowed much quickly. pants like, extruded asshole? Ouch! ""We Patrick! saved state."" 100% chance people wear anyway. Everyone said Bush idiot least hired smart people around listened them, even made mistakes there.  least NYC shut everything fuck saw coming. get feeling folks South jus‚Äô goin‚Äô bidness. Old immuno compromised people would assume can‚Äôt tell many people whole thing think precisely way. literal GM second job EXACT take whole situation. said things along ‚Äúthere navy boat 2,000 people tested positive none symptoms‚Äù don‚Äôt understand it. Good burn. Here's award. Great, methods safely implemented ""too expensive, much effort.""

Paper says ""if X, maybe Y"" people wanted read certain way took claiming ""Y fine."" Proof cops training?? Maybe country, America. doesnt kill makes stronger.... unless leads chronic illness despite fact government labels case ""What would say ‚Äòwe‚Äôre confident it‚Äôs likely make full recovery‚Äô even viruses cause post-viral syndromes usually full recovery, may prolonged case. honest say, ‚Äòwe don‚Äôt really know, nobody world knows‚Äô.‚Äù  least depend district city. Schools local issue. guys fucked. I'm sorry level headed American friends. Maybe we're selfish assholes. us, least enough vote current supreme asshole office. compare CV Dr Fauci‚Äôs, anything jump you? think states reporting well. I'd say see numbers mysteriously go look right know old donnie done something numbers Thems fightin‚Äô words! üôÉ thats bleak

edit: im seeing cases florida takes 3 weeks even get results... ugh. think meant ‚Äúfollow science‚Äù American heard American Redzone. Totally drafting Covid19 fantasy year. think we're missing important point - governor shops Walmart. Oh god no, wasn‚Äôt trying accuse anyone anything. Aside current administration. I‚Äôm sorry came way! time someone says something like me, shake head say ""if knew stupid sound spewing shit, shut weeks ago."" actually works often not. used called idea react jaw drop. we've gotten better keeping people alive curing them. good individuals get care, bad leads fuller ICUs less able access care. Two sides coin. Wait. point. actual fuck? we‚Äôre get lot videos Georgia recently set can‚Äôt mandate masks. ‚Äòfun‚Äô first time we've heard this. We've hearing everyone say MONTHS around world. Bet mean total catalonia.. local media guy city COVID pretty bad back spring, he‚Äôs currently bitching indoor dining moving forward.

Just....what? Huh? no. not. Yes definitely Should. Like... That's main deciding factor. 

This literally matter life death. Agreed. We‚Äôre can. Hope stay safe well! doesn‚Äôt seem bright .... I‚Äôve searching chart shows mortality rates month month vs past years. post link? Yeah I'm sure people looking places like Costco Walmart favorably here. mean fine Costco required ago happy ceding sort decision making large corporations. fucking least elected officials recently made show hiding whatever just, ""nah billionaires make decisions now"". right open.

The fuck? Hey chum, also MA. went Cambridge last weekend everyone saw wearing mask except two rowdy kids probably 6 8 whose dad clearly given up. Pretty much every place I‚Äôve last months 90% compliance wearing masks, although number would count dimwits don‚Äôt wear correctly.

If every state vigilant New England area we‚Äôd entirely different conversations I‚Äôd Fenway Park Yankees jersey. side effect whole thing might high availability distance tutors. Try comparing one-on-one time son math major, vs 30 person classroom teacher might even strong math background sincere appreciation math. Worldometers even texas' cases put yet either. it, need know. pattern disease became clear me: viral phase people develop symptoms several days exposure virus, inflammatory phase days weeks infectious symptoms appear (or don‚Äôt), often much worse dangerous. latter process named multisystem inflammatory syndrome children (MIS-C).

Doctor's experience children suffer less 'viral phase', (coughing, shorness breath, nausea, etc...) adults do.

And children suffer less frequently 'inflammatory' phase adults do, none less suffer it.

It's mystery, coronavirus. inflammatory phase dangerous adults children. ""EVERYONE right live, long they're fetus"" need dig outhouse pits deeper keep spreading? Seems like remember something limit far parasite could travel.. So, pit deep enough, spread. Mickey Skaven along Lol whenever yall ready ill truck... news articles covering this:

&amp;#x200B;

* hahahah factory downtown! group concerned STEM education making sure children educated properly. factoring public health pandemic disclaimer people die due kids moving virus school home. Fuck. I'm hoping best everyone living Florida. Stock food supplies, going fun. can't say whether mandated Target? read title article? Lots people commenting headline without actually watching video. sad little frustrating true comment is. Dunning Kruger effect strong states. lot people taking seriously, MASSIVE subset population ignorant selfish (or plain assholes) take pandemic seriously. behalf us: sorry! 

I live California people taking seriously, huge populations people disregard guidelines social distancing, masks, on. family extreme conservative parts country sharing posts social media dangerous masks are. I'm shaking head thinking ""you might dead weeks"" feeling sad all. Except fact carelessness might lead death someone innocent. local asian supermarket shut like 6 weeks, certainly require masks anybody enters. Anybody disagrees gets screamed old chinese lady, means never again. article:

**The order requires people Colorado 11 years older wear covering noses mouths:**

\-When entering moving within public indoor space.

\-While using waiting use public (buses, light-rail) non-personal (taxis, car services, ride-shares) transportation services.

**People wear mask include:**

\-People 10 years old younger.

\-People cannot medically tolerate face covering.

\-Children ages 2 wear masks cloth face coverings.

Gov. Polis also adds state masks ready send school districts resume in-person classes. kids forced stay indoors home feel dandy everything alright nothing kill old relatives (with added bonus afraid go school drilled them)? stayed home, ~~swam, BBQed,~~ drank ~~and watched fireworks back patio.~~

I almost same, minus things Yeah, alarm sounded, some, 4 months ago. entire thread filled people worried finances take care children, unreasonable worry finances due people's bad decisions? Yeah. Good one. Yep, steal tech? reports whether vaccine works? removed different counties use different criteria deciding infected. state wants use one standard criteria across counties. makes sense. argue criteria wrong, standardizing data good thing. million thank yous &lt;3 Stay safe! I've always wanted go cruise. learned treat staff. learned Covid. There's way I'm getting one floating petri dishes. Millions peaches? local target, 1 10 employees wearing masks properly. noses out, one guy even using beard cover only. stats differ much. Worldometers texas 156 deaths yesterday, today record then? think need stop treating entertainers though important average citizen think foolish us concerned ""getting back normal"" middle highly infectious pandemic. understand business perspective entertainment perspective, tests could put better use elsewhere really think time gladiatorial games put ahead public health. wife went cast preview Epcot said tons room guests, never around anyone occasionally cast member face shield mask. spots waiting line something like 10 feet apart. Really can't ask much beyond ""don't open"". Id really surprised see mass spread precautions they're taking. Again, agree, wanted Berny times. I'm talking getting right move vote left. That's problem. Biden viewed leftist puppet. right scared losing love left take happens. Convencing left want make life harder them, make easier trick. Trader Joe‚Äôs right away too. August 12th , cities around us gone e learning think eventually.

It‚Äôs different it‚Äôs children , child gets sick ... won‚Äôt care helped president GDP They're trying nuanced, agree overall opening schools top priority. 

But making top priority means make getting Covid19 control top priority, reopen. 

We summer, everyone power twiddled thumbs, want act like care education. cared would dealing planning last 5 months. 

Not waiting August saying ""fuck send em back see happens"" someone smarter explain news suddenly back talking Oxford's successful Phase results, understanding completed Phase II earlier year, currently waiting results phase III, late August? Different type injection typically.
Most vaccines giving injection muscle, wheras insulin done injection skin.

Far less go wrong subcutaneous injections compares intramuscular ones.

Hence bit training necessary teach people location IM injection safely possible, without risk nerve damage paralysis. Wat ""Sweden success story agree him, would never downwote either. good hear. wonder 100 million doses distributed conjunction amount people already allow type return normal life end year I'm sure 9 yr olds laser focused, think would agree that's typical. Thanks man, you‚Äòre best! Fox News bad virus... know current estimate year's end 200,000 dead, criminally negligent governors president been, expect we're going hit least 300,000, plus many non COVID ""excess deaths"" due constrained medical resources poverty. know we're going see equivalent 9/11 every day, feels like we're runway train right now. Can‚Äôt believe real coordinated national response pandemic led nation‚Äôs retailers Eh, maybe. viruses do, all. example one burning would HIV.  Except licensed prepare taxes, individual returns incredibly simple. liken changing oil car. know how, that's hard, takes little time. Everyone could it, people pay $35 avoid hassel. trust going process test Preparer's Tax Id #, hard file taxes HandR block would fucked you. Impossible sadly. workforce commutes work overcrowded taxis, taking day. squashed back work vans. people live crowded townships without running water spaces money self quarintine. winter, aircon schools opening opening windows.

There little comfort list fortunes.

We need laptops students losing future. need competent managers, politicians, nurses doctors. NEED money.

My mom's 20 year old business closed. dad's company paying 30% salaries. Government continue fund studies. Still Belgium (comparable population 11 million), Italy, Spain U.K. WAY New Jersey New York. fact deaths per 100k lower Louisiana. Hell, Sweden December know wonderful anyway besides Covid comparisons.

Since masks became mandatory face cover gaiter Swedish flag. public schooling system raided warped years become little daycare many parents go spend 40+ hours week making money someone else. rich folks either ignore public school together via private charter schools, work diligently make sure local tax dollars benefit local schools, creating embarrassing discrepancy quality education around U.S.

The 'educational' risk minor. main risk pushing agenda working class parents forced quit jobs order stay home kids resulting economic pullback declining stock prices. Oh shit must know him. Nailed it. got hope elderly Florida catch covid death toll going horrific Yes wonder people worse stats admitted preserve space resources rights!

""High school teacher chiming here. us zero notice (not even grab crap Friday case). us classrooms set online. Several us infrastructure home accommodate. ironed issues, districts told kids none counted. 

I believe firmly things ironed weeks advance, whole thing would go smoother. ""

At point, several districts' teachers trainings online platforms best practices. unpaid, told salaries likely get cut. Regardless that, districts still planning face face classes PPE intermittent cleaning supplies given us. We'll pay too. Also, I'm 100% sure I'm going fund stash students, seeing food hygiene stash every year (and teach great school). 

School districts lot expendable income. simply money come (and pay for) sorts plans... districts funded properly, expect? reporting criteria did? make difference longer reporting CDC?

Yes, that's exactly did. desperately tried continue false narrative symptoms worsened, folded announced lockdown. One week later, *revealed* virus. Yeah, also somehow attracted putting STEM degree use industry ridiculous money much less babysitting, must absolute greedy monster. read full quote, saying headline implies saying. Since going nitpick, misread Worldometers trying say. 
Worldometers describing calculating mortality rate relation cases (CFR/IFR). describing mortality rate relation national population today(CMR). Mortality rate correct term. calculate mortality rate based differing sets data. (Known cases, actual cases, herd immunity threshold total number cases, current population, etc.) it‚Äôs simpler say mortality. Fixed..

Also note comment referring deaths/capita mortality rate *that article headline mirroring doing* point, pretty much fait accompli. administration failed response virus completely probably toughest critics could imagined. sense folks keeping heads down, dealing immediate concerns around looking towards election. painfully obvious administration simply going take corrective measures unless a) market falls b) supporters push back administration want realignment truth virus continues ravage traditionally Republican strongholds. thing is. know long term effects virus asymptomatic mild cases. infection big deal. parents hate news lol. mom talking could steal assault people Target cops come come ""liberals tell wearing mask""

They realize Fox News much propaganda CNN It‚Äôs actually exactly stand way this. fact it‚Äôs literally thing determine this. fact, politics actually thing needs move aside science. Students temperature checked entering building, showing COVID symptoms asked go home.

Edited add - last year remember sending students office sniffles cold-symptoms, sent back class running fever. know happen year, something need check admin. Europes cases started going way already, lock March like US.

It didn‚Äôt explode July, countries demonstrated contain virus without draconian. Good thing job clear communicator important public officials, could cause real issues case. Delta Air already added 50 people N0-Fly List including employee traveling fun. american speaking, definitely not. us way, I'll damned us. üòî Yeah, 35k active cases.. added 5k+ last 5 days without death. lag issue. statistical impossibility.

People's savings tapped, businesses life support. shut NEW YORK needed shut down...Not best us close... happen, least locally at. still fairly low case count goes, whole county 4 deaths.  know number increase, covid tearing us moment. point may best interest shut down... probably needs county county state state. Like said reason Shut NY Florida bad time... 

Anyway, targeting directly conversation  beautiful terrifying account one survivors exponential VIRUS... covid denierd attack one? always double self awareness? look dumb even know Vasa's history well, could googled it. Insanity. Pure insanity. Wait, serious? stupid, ignorant comment. One leading vaccine candidates developers, Moderna, based California. Pfizer, American company based New York, also one promising vaccine candidates. AstraZeneca, arguably best advanced candidate yet, based Oxford, received vast majority funding US Government ($1.25 billion). promising candidate company called Cansino, based China, though trouble getting research participants outside country unlike three mentioned above.

The US response lackluster, disorganized, clunky, there‚Äôs quite literally denying US comes finding vaccine treatments. unless seem live rock, like seem to. 

Again, stupid, ignorant ass comment behalf. corporate employees paid poor decision lives.

What happened? many got sick died?

edit: found one corporate employee died Coronavirus, still made corporate employees come in, sent home shortly thereafter. 2 tested positive. It‚Äôs Utah it‚Äôs mostly white state probably Hispanics crowd. leader took hard stance hoax, rather show ounce empathy compassion. narcissist see every little thing personal attack. narcissist would do, label hoax, perpetuated enemy Democrats get removed office. look forward seeing that. That's happen, Abbott moral compass whatsoever, Daddy Donald turns heat him, expect hold line. What's crazy could turn around. Today. real shutdown. Give 6 weeks. 
Get masks, get contact tracers, face backlogs tests patients. Make plans, prep buildings. real national effort. 

Open school later year extend school year. 

We could it, won't. Instead we're going leave people make awful choices, traumatize children, burn medical workers, damn country. 

It's bullshit man. Well thought protests bad June need prepare August/September. June look like cake walk comparison. Without $600 get $89 week live on. industry completely decimated high risk, can‚Äôt exactly get job exposed people day. think removing unemployment going benefit many seats election fall? record unemployment, rising COVID cases, eviction moratoriums ending, top bunch sick kids schools open.  great complete shutdown possible without complete goverment enforcement support. happen lot people still believe hoax nothing flu bet Publix 5below. already. already best stores around masks percentage. Georgia‚Äôs counties tiny, numbers get skewed. 

Georgia 100+ counties California does. spending money, believe that. breakthroughs money. 

Where US leading research/ vaccine development? Apart covid cases mortalities. legitimate question, America figured want already researched peer reviewed?  think wrong one also wrong other.

If wrong three months ago, someone else sure hell started afterwards. Florida always it, changed incentive program order require hospitals send residents back. step backwards something already failed. Why? Normal life seems, me, like strange thing talk now. crazy much changed 5 months feels like much longer that. see new record everyday Florida. think millions might infected idea. guys shooting new high scores!  remember seeing Australia fire thinking that's going one defining moments year seems minor like years ago. also remember going holiday mid January without knowledge covid was. Infact first heard covid January thought would end like SARS touch west. Oh, smart. quick feet sharp tack. Unfortunately also horrible. evangelical brainwashed sycophant speaks lie lie shame self-awareness. 

I heard press briefing floored said this, typical her. saying safe open schools. saying important so.

It unsafe important. perhaps consider question epidemics often come waves, even prior germ theory disease understanding viruses disease prevention. reason believe another wave Sweden? might be? reading posts around thread know feel it. it, want I'm practically home prison avoid it. even need hard lockdown get control. wear mask, follow social distance guidelines close non essential businesses. Ontario never hard lock saw numbers decrease. would've decrease faster hard lockdown needed. Construction still going on, went surveying, saw many businesses factories still open. close businesses like gym, church's restaurants beauty salons, non essential shops. businesses major contributor economy important. lot places went 100% track it, lot dont stop anyone wearing mask either, knows future holds love Dr. Fauci realize anecdotal man. I'm 35 practically everyone know age boarded home griping parents gallavanting around resumed normal life. us. Texas, might get banana thrown wearing mask. Karen pop bushes ask ""what property?"" Think Kroger mask enter over, Nuremberg type trial officials mandating masks. Self centered. thinks he's immune wants whatever wants Surely people high slip bucks... call nitpicking properly use mortality rate talking mortality rate, sure, let's see Wikipedia generic form,¬†mortality rates seen calculated using¬†(d/p) x 10^n, where¬†*d*¬†represents deaths whatever cause interest specified occur within given time period,¬†*p*¬†represents size population deaths occur (however population defined limited), and¬†10^n conversion factor resulting fraction another unit (e.g., multiplying by¬†10^3 get mortality rate per 1,000 individuals).

Here's important size population deaths occur

What means, use Corona example, one looks exclusively number Corona cases, death Corona occurs part population Corona.

Or, summarize, deaths/cases. Yeah. really interesting. think actually need new science explain what's going on, look know get contradictions. get sentiment. Let add perspective. sister brother nurses nursing homes NY pandemic hit. brother quit sister still goes spent significant time COVID unit. Makes hero eyes tbh people needed there. 

She deserves pay. deserve pay. Best luck, hope stay safe too. matter though feel forced unsafe environment, anyone wants yell go fuck let get you. Ha, yes, I‚Äôll edit \s problem? goal create COVID-19 vaccine? That's problem it. masks barely fit nose. someone please talk sense governor Abbott? pleading willful ignorance passing blame everybody else confronted Insane. going boot families street. ask fucking pandemic. They're home they're stupid lazy. trying live fucking life got clobbered natural disaster. 

The 1% needs pay shit, could fix everything. think Donald probably said he‚Äôs sick bad numbers wants stop that. Science Liar Thank goodness looks like need /s ""Yer violatin' muh Hippa!"" Great, can't trust data. like could trust before, however, least supposed accurate reflection testing even limitations backlogs. someone White House could've filtered know.

Obviously need test more. agree, definitely should‚Äôve either done earlier shave time Phase 3 trials phase 3 trials intended run year think might get data need Liability game believe.

As understand major retailers mask policy say Target could prove got COVID19 Target potentially judge could rule Target's fault mask policy thus must pay medical bills.

Any lawyers around tell I'm wrong right? people died then, zero harm Russia data helps I've got problem it. quite possible stop exploring useless avenues wasting time trying things already failed therefore speeding efforts saving lives. maybe piggyback something looks promising come solution faster, knows, unprecedented times call unprecedented measures. bullshit political/financial reasons everyone would working together hiding possibly important data eachother. don‚Äôt think knows things work proning team. damn stressful. stay proned 16 hours. help. RIP Georgia Also one article said 100 fewer hospitalizations. 110 deaths. 

Let find it.

Kodama says proves people immunity, since infected virus similar novel coronavirus may spread across Asia before. ""Cross immunity may worked people got infected new coronavirus,"" commented. ""

The data forms immunologic response metabolism. dipshits ever care one own. want seventeen year old playing mask police? joke. many dead disabled kids acceptable number? Yes Thought state relatively well, deaths per capita county top 3% highest deaths per capita. second. share them? I'd like bookmark too. whole thing vaccine rush corners cut everywhere. 
 
Not even Fauci saying corners cut.   
  Moderna going directly phase 1 phase 3, skipping phase 2 altogether. many vaccine candidates. 

I seen anybody actually skip phases. I've seen many combined phases like ""Phase I/II"" such, notably Oxford, seen skipped phases. lot vaccines approved Phase 3 ahead data released phases seen outright skipped.
 
Moderna [did skip Phase 2 Phase 2 completed enrollment [earlier Thats wonderful news goes like north carolina nobody enforcing mandate hasnt changed damn thing. think cute skirt around rules. 

Even businesses ive service work take masks time tell people dont really wear them. wear mine entire time im work get laughed guess so? ordered book online shipped store save shipping cost. know curbside thing arrived completely dark store 7 PM haha. call local store see they're doing. know book want might let pay phone Bullshit, even right thing then, we'll start cycle over. 

They're fighting it. They're helping it. McEnemy people. Build wall southern border make pay good news flair! However, Governor Abbott hasn‚Äôt issued new statewide stay-at-home order 

Why he? Hospitalizations decreasing, available ICU beds increasing. Mfw I'm shopping Wegman's last 4 months they've required mask since probably first week April. 

Better late never.  honest, makes America great. cower face adversity. we're willing take deaths keep show running. value truth hysteria. Let bodies come. good. me, stores security registers entrance. 

You can't get wearing mask.

Those waiting line register, rung they're ready pay escorted security.

Security personnel spot wearing masks line move line they're rung up. even alert cashier ring cashier won't. frontrunner means, always find alternative approaches interesting. best memory, there's three four Canadian companies asked permission begin human trials well, though much coverage ones.

I'm sick young people refusing shut states counties they're charge refusing direct government spending towards testing. even get started greedy young people refusing pay people stay home one choose putting others risk staying home. 

The youth failed elected leaders. I'm disappointed them.

genetics weirdly interesting. Still fucking testing still fucking testing. Come guys, we're months thing now. beyond rookie move. T/rump resign. I‚Äôve seen bars southern states packed though well social distancing masks Exactly. CDC made many good people good advice taken added scrutiny, all. That‚Äôs tragic. I've seen sources claiming decision take counters reversed CDC would continue posting that's it. data would still go HHS CDC. fact link counter concerned op overstating things Best luck you, friend. Hang there. Probably good choice still embarrassing bad getting tests done could add popcorn maker sell bags dime. /s still don‚Äôt understand people don‚Äôt wear masks world baffling organ damage claiming requires symptoms.

Duh.

And zero reputable sources. ""dancing DJT's tune"". Trump allowing Fauci talk seemed listening. Trump started get nervous economy started contradicting Fauci things got nasty. Fauci refused play along Trump contradicted publicly times, Trump stopped allowing speak press briefings blocked media interviews. government won‚Äôt it, good thing store requiring Yep. I‚Äôm bartender. amount people come order pull masks mouth talk depressing. 

It‚Äôs seriously 1/4 people- progressive area. I‚Äôm asshole telling put back on. Every man himself, point, eh usa? That‚Äôs be. People need guidance. recommend Mayo Clinic Ivy League colleges/medical universities. You‚Äôll take advice won‚Äôt you?

It may displeasure think _you are_transmitting disease kill 50 unless prevent spreading it.  True it‚Äôs killing it‚Äôs cold &amp; mask inconvenient you. get it. Think 50 people around you. They‚Äôll die spread disease. aren‚Äôt enough ventilators intensive care units beds staff support 50. suffer die suffering. Think way. target waiting August 1 required? 5 days notice good enough Walmart Kroger. Virus going wait August 1st. üò© Got email BJs today, required starting 20th Also [coronavirus emergency laws legalise enforcing 'isolation' put parliament early 10th Lowe's well. Starts Monday. 2.5 hours reporting numbers 63 500 cases little 800 deaths. thinking something along lines... hospitals report 100k COVID cases request funding based along tests showing that. White House reports 10k cases still pays hospitals 100k COVID.   I'm sure federal govt afterwards. agree you. feel privileged moment college-educated SAHM. hard schools closed. trained teacher advocated public schools professional teachers mattering. never expected homeschool.

The biggest reason advocating schools open earlier recognize privilege. many homes facing poverty educational disadvantages already. Thinking parents can't help kids algebra never took it, help proficient English. homes parents mostly absent teens' lives they're hanging streets getting trouble may never make back school. mention kids special needs. parents must work feed put roof kids' heads.

The choices making close schools going exacerbate gulf haves nots may trickle generations.

There good options. Absolutely none. immunity =! can‚Äôt get reinfected. time memory cells able stop infected. Well, never said re-open everything. So, I'm surprised post evidence that.

As submissions, understand likely post things agree with, consider everybody does. Oftentimes simply physical banks communities. closest bank underprivileged school district work 13.5 miles away (21 min direct driving necessitates using toll roads, 35 min away without using toll roads). Many families one car, one all, public transit nonexistent area. I'm mostly worried teachers. one parents want send students back class they're forced teach person pandemic quit. post says decision reversed? people, included, trouble finding says that. nobody else this? ‚Äúcommunists?‚Äù  still different. last culture institutions country change fast. Again, dense potato:

A true patriot (and decent human) wants protect fellow countrymen (and human) get country (and world) back track quickly possible. make you? Short miracle, vaccine ready general consumption school year (it's never done fast new virus) maybe next either. schools stay closed time children way kindergarten stack up. rate system seem respond to, well anything, reopen teachers/schools means teach sheer volume kids coming either. 

Hopefully sort virtual learning done, ignores fact lots single parent working families parent(s) can't work home can't afford child care. families (and rural families) may even access devices internet needed virtual learning. mention abuse, potential malnutrition, suicidal thoughts (there kids people NEED social interaction physical touch), more.

Not mention kids special needs. 

There literally absolutely good options regardless path chosen (I'm leaving towards closing schools virtual learning), really know full impact choices pandemic :( don‚Äôt need shutdown, need people wear masks self quarantine discipline. weakest links screw everyone over. They're step away blaming Jews point. Woodman's too. local schools released result parent survey last week. 12 percent people responded reliable internet. Another 2 percent used cell phone hot spots source internet. kids matter too. aw shit better be. pissed....or like one crazed suicidal sailors stranded ocean give swim away floating shit hanging onto let sharks eat them....

in case - go walk without mask walk everyone...... agree needs happen, enforces this? works retail high school hated it...I can‚Äôt imagine enforcing every day...retail workers saints. issue netherlands, many killed. Maybe. article doesn‚Äôt actual information though. says they‚Äôll announce tomorrow. cases come outside? Indoor sports? Sharing equipment? Sharing rides?

That‚Äôs kind thing need know make informed decisions sure that‚Äôs everywhere. went inside well several others Criterion 50% sale last weekend. masks took turns looking movies though. care downvotes. people say good riddance non-maskwearers die get upvotes, tells need know. grateful Reddit preparing pandemic back January. they're combined phase 2 &amp; 3

they released papers phase 1 (which lot detailed ""it works"") Haha, take anti-maskers! researchers able move swiftly already developed vaccine candidate Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), virulent respiratory disease caused another member coronavirus family. Last year showed vaccine safe people prompts immune response lasts least year. January, group began adapting technique create vaccine SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus responsible COVID-19.

as far know, vaccines far along, also based past sars mers research, see vaccine end year early next year.

but yes, approved mers vaccines.  socialism!!!! ""Why masks problem gloves?"" Simple enough. touch objects face/mask, even reuse mask day (or longer) rubbing door handles, shopping carts, on.

I would certainly argue concerned airborne virus, certainly mask wash dispose traveling day otherwise normal day definitely increase odds contamination. nothing else, keeping damp environment front face multiple hours day, every day. Otherwise contaminants would normally dispersed air literally allowed grow culture mask. mean, saying *every* mask certified kill viruses? 

is requirement? No? not, why? what's purpose? 

I would argue again, full NBC suit mandate? Trumps Mini - fucking disgrace.

It‚Äôs understanding guys went back school, Netherland‚Äôs case numbers really low. However, Texas, Florida, southern states U.S. sky rocketing cases could start school next month, pure insanity. 

I predict enough funding purchase PPE hire staff help monitor/facilitate social distancing protocols, since underfunded last 10-20 years. afraid Covid-19 spread numerous students teachers, learning communities may suffer result. 

This dark period history get this. think missed /s.

I say I've literally heard ""We rescued Africa freed best country world, small price pay fact still owe us gratitude freeing them"" argument people before. again, RIP Texas.

I know likely mean literally, even like think skipping years life! got great cloth masks H Mart. know ""some"" = ""people wear masks."" I'm mad Russia messing elections can't really mad this.

The elephant room everyone seems ignoring sharing research putting intellectual property Human lives keeping secret.

I'm intellectual property. Intellectual property performs important function promoting innovation. efficient CPU better model car new video game, medicine, deals people's lives. Property never put people's lives. need find humane way incentivize innovation development, way cost people's lives.

Ideally international treaty, agree make project open source agree signatories pay participating researchers companies based 1. honest evidence-based effort 2. results huge bonus offered cure, vaccine, medication significantly reduces fatality adverse outcomes. still incentivize development withholding information could used save people's lives.

Failing we're still playing people's lives say ""well wanted open source system save people'a lives nobody else getting board."" years we've used reasoning excuse dealing climate change even justify torture. Sometimes taking moral high ground means turning cheek. still control ourselves. could still make research open-source should. Maybe would inspire others right thing. Maybe not. least putting research sooner would good chance saving lives. keep incentive innovation could still offer taxpayer-funded incentive system companies. True, I'd bet folks recognize incredible contributions black people made American culture. statement like saying agree John Travolta wife letting kid die didnt trust medicine. 2021 Fuck links Sun Ugh life long sufferer atypical migraines cluster headaches mark calendar days \*don't\* wake headache... never gonna see thing coming..... right think random things we've banned years. right think asbestos deet I'm sure hundreds things cause cancer something like that.

Ahh ok, problem prescribed half shutdown people traveling. far know never checkpoints half dead new Yorker could've driven Alabama coughed everything people alabama happily went way.

The failing think politicizing world wide event, cutting lock short, lack proper education Hello , nothing. That‚Äôs dashboard website, nothing tallying going forward...which directed away CDC. Useful confusion. probably started getting sent numbers thousands labs hospitals said fuck Muh rights!!! Liberating, nice choice words. could demand put everyone else spotlight sharing info. no. didn't. know why. sit down, look pretty go bother someone else think recourse administration hospitals didnt comply cut federal funding formw aid would PR disaster. ideas seem like they're proposed people idea system works? Wait still say happens? Fucking asshat Thank good man!

Edit: good woman! shocked public doesn‚Äôt take rage health insurance industry way Minneapolis police. Kemp suing eliminate local restrictions, masks. factual information continuously deny therefore need stressed continuously stop spreading lies. Protesters actually think that. people wont believe grieving someones death virus. exactly would prove that? Florida city/county mask mandates plenty people ignore them. still state-wide mask mandate sure people use argue need all. 

With lack mask restrictions such, would expect Florida pretty badly right? Oh shit, are. badly, even falsifying data one worst centers world this. 

So again, tell need proof random bullshit see whats front eyes? exactly. Businesses fail time. Businesses lose money corruption time.

Everyone fetishizes running things like business damn moron sort like americans we‚Äôre trying buy rights back door. sleazy shit, different tactic 5k cases per day contact tracing cases universal nationwide mask mandates hybrid education system billions dollars - chance.

But new new plan is: ""don't let science stand way opening schools."" county $25 first offense, $50 second, $100 every time after. Yet see cops wearing time. Cashier's maskless. would bet almost one fined all. Costco Walmart actually hardasses this. honestly need be. back down. Jesus fucking Christ thank God

And I'm damned athiest Federal government can't it

They it. absolutely *can.* still time exile frump Canada ? Rona DeathSentence.

Mask mandate hurts people‚Äôs phreedumz. I‚Äôve decided south begins New Jersey. 

Anything crazy happens. Except right here, course, want look mortality rate Corona, logical thing look deaths/cases. That's definition limitation measurement.

Otherwise, one use entire populations looking mortality rate specific cause, one would get Monty Python levels silly numbers like eaten bear 0.00000005% mortality rate. Sure, one *can* calculate way, world talking mortality rate Corona, they're talking deaths/cases.

Source Yes, caseload, ICU, etc. declining. Likely part Sweden unofficial lockdown form summer holiday: schools huge portion country vacation right now. 

The decline started way holiday season though? B&amp;N requiring masks opening. police get decide laws enforce? Business usual USA. seem care enforcing constitution anymore, emoluments clause indication. first thought well. Ah ok...my bad
I pretty reactionary there
Just trying stay front moving goalposts Masks reduce risk transmission, eliminate it. somebody HIV positive sex without telling you, would better protection used? Either way person asshole knowingly potentially risking infecting serious disease. let's real, protection sure better nothing cases. CA teacher here. got word district starting new year distance learning. nurse working COVID ICU Arizona, agree. Let‚Äôs particular experiment. read somewhere 18 bad influenza year 19 not. theories lot people around normally die influenza killed Covid. would course whole death toll compared bad flu year. ""How could sinking? We're hundreds feet air!"" They're way. cases Arizona today yesterday. Could soon end 5k cases day. Can't believe Kemp disallowed mask mandates statewide. Probably cause thinks everyone forget caused deaths hundreds Georgians he's reelection 2022. things, expect major businesses actually right thing unless forced. I'm shook. They're still evil, wow. Mine cost nothing, headline false. say going easy. case confused, hard. mean maybe time start spitting wingnuts? Bot, freakin' deal? sad labeled ""good news"". saying good news begin with. Thanks! ground, fear. protect morally bankrupt ideals dying political party. Rooftop solar good use space IMO. helps distribution issues generate power utilized. realize I‚Äôm oversimplifying, don‚Äôt time go right now. Agree solar isn‚Äôt cure-all, although wish simple. 

The parking lot solar another good urban concept, although I‚Äôd rather push hard ‚Äúcar-based solution‚Äù guess... Zuck method platform could get good information lot people... Florida thinks competition health department needs enforcement officers. No, 3 mega corporations better 1 mega corporation.   right par average intelligence people. obvious now. Except policies businesses put place require negative test return work going need changed now.

Though kinda anyways since states aren‚Äôt testing asymptomatic anymore testing delays nearly long ad quarantine period. Longer count time takes get test appointment. therein problem. 99% human species far removed horrifying reality covid-19. 

And admit becoming numb. numbers longer seem like people. living nightmare simply ""real"" 99%. tell everyone work ""you're going think real late."" 

Sad  Might well extend year. Yes. Alabama confirm. Bars restaurants shut employees getting sick testing positive. large companies reporting staying open. people wearing masks social distancing, still people participating either. I've heard dozens people say hoax. thought Huntsville smart, wrong Cuz easier tear gas us wearing protection. Trump worst asshat ever.

People dying. care?  dick wrong. say district paid PD coming up. like feeling unprepared, we're fighting district union work well. complex issue, like prepared. damned do, damned situation. 

I'd love way. fuck liking job wanting good position school starts totally lose trust students immediately looking like know like care, they're kids realize fault--that district administration's job GET us ready.

I disagree you. know I'm stupid working summer. whole department says daily. keep talking working. teachers work summer. hyped year distance learning us really demoralizing Spring we're trying put better position hate much Fall. No.

Midtown Atlanta nightly applause break healthcare workers weeks. downtown Marriott lit windows shape heart healthcare workers, think Hilton right next something similar. least 90% people wearing masks downtown/midtown grocery stores. Costco fuck around that. They'll drag sorry ass right warehouse cancel membership. love Costco.   Dude, angry, lay vodka roids. 

And even speak Ukraine. seen eyes done there. fucked Syria well. supported genocidal pig Miloseviƒá. 

Stop whining world cheer invaded poor country, wanted free. got shown bunch badly armed volunteers too. like nobody cheer hacking attacks hospitals scientists. OK, sometimes lil mysterious controversy fun :-) actually quoting woman article. Gives laundry list ridiculous reasons legally exempt wearing mask, caps ""and even work!"" don‚Äôt know got gold this, venting :) don‚Äôt think malicious, think stupid. suspected masks helped desperate get healthcare workers, good reason. short-sighted attempt get masks healthcare workers, instead honest saying ‚Äúwe believe masks prevent spread, don‚Äôt enough, please donate respirators masks home frontline use bandanas cloth masks personal use‚Äù, chose push silly lie average person negatively impacted mask use. problem public doesn‚Äôt know wear mask, teach them! takes 30 second video explain wear one properly, we‚Äôve seen now. field would bad PR move, fighting pandemic, became negligent IMO. good scientists doctors CDC work twice hard believed, leadership partly blame.

Imagine NASCAR, MMA, NBA, NFL, MLB, commercials players telling people wear masks. 

If one thing unites Americans, politics, science, entertainment. people voted American Idol 2012 2012 presidential election. Entertainment really ones encouraging mask wearing- people listen. biden? spewing obviously false bullshit years years he?

Remember whole ""lock up"" thing?

What happened? anyone get locked except trumps people? play bullshit games honest real life things actually really happen every day minutes? get live world entirely built imagination evil democrats forcing Trump commit felonies daily basis look objectively real life see Republicans consistently done shit job white house least past 20 years even league wide testing; players league knows tested positive far. little less size one training camp roster. huge deal, continue see numbers high. 

However, virtually every sports league started seen lot players test positive testing begins number decreases time, still (imo) sort optimism league able function simple wear mask fucking assholes. honest care upvotes, downvotes, etc..

In short: DOH data messy, labs entered several times different names, sometimes negative results small portion total tests.

More importantly, change ""When conservatively delete facility listings positive rate 80% above, lowers total average positivity (excluding inconclusive tests) 11.08%... 10.80%. **A difference whopping 0.28%.**"" Texas hell bent beating Florida Covid olympics. ü•áFor us! goalposts moved far ""flatten curve"" I'm sure I'm going feel continuing here, essential employee all, people continue paid sit home making going work important country apparently am.

Obviously, enough information determine death could avoided. probably could still serving justice, mean unjustified.

However, argument really pertinent absolutely everything done store/police point appears justified man's actions obviously way anti-mask argument. think ~~BMI~~ friend. excerpt fro one referenced journals:


In 47 COVID-19‚Äìinfected German children, nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral loads similar age groups, raising concern children could infectious adults.
Because SARS-CoV-2 infected children frequently mildly symptomatic, may weaker less frequent cough, releasing fewer infectious particles surrounding environment. Another possibility school closures occurred locations along widespread physical distancing orders, close contacts became limited households, reducing opportunities children become infected community present index cases.

With limitations studies I‚Äôm sure confidently say it‚Äôs safe. 

If cannot even get adults follow mask/social distancing requirements earth would get children comply. loves people say live la la land don‚Äôt think Spain anything wrong. locked super hard really beat cases. Unless solution let‚Äôs ruin entire world fully hibernate vaccine, you‚Äôll surges lulls even everything right. Spain deal little surge Love fact governor made private business can‚Äôt make people wear masks :/ sure? one definitely hasn‚Äôt, employees don‚Äôt even wear them. signs mentioning anything masks. haven‚Äôt seen lists businesses requiring yet. wish act humanity. corporate reaction governments lack action screwing money. scientists economists calling months. But, guess however get there, better. *is* valid concern despite handwaving away downvoting correct statement.

Several negative medical responses due errant antibody reactions already documented CoV-disease. Cytokine storms antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) occurred animal testing SARS vaccines. Autoimmune diseases, as, rheumatoid arthritis, Hashimoto, Graves' disease examples body's antibodies attacking itself.

The bottom line scientists really know *how* antibodies work. Cytokine storms already observed discussed relation COVID19 and, one claim that's immune system *supposed* work, scientists understand occur people others. often revealed point sale

Or after! infuriated customary responses get ask cost medication, procedure, test, exam. Hospital, primary care, specialist, circles.

I live somewhat poor area, staff providers assume I'm new area uninsured ask billing prices. realize I'm private insurance, answer shifts to, ""Oh, we'll bill insurance,"" ""Your copay visit is..."" press, subject becomes offer payment plan assurance work much. conservative five times six, can't get single number context cost leave offer (outside copay).

It's maddening. acknowledge sometimes private industry reasonable effective government? stores taking steps making mandates governors federal government still scared do. 

Examples like reminder cautious government control and/or influence private industry. Otherwise would people like Trump, DeSantis, Kemp telling Target, Walmart, etc aren‚Äôt allowed this.

Edit: Private retail requiring masks private corporations still allowing work home overall public health government point. Trump influence private corporations, would threatening rushing back normal like he‚Äôs public schools. over, he, several governors, attorneys general, handful others, need prosecuted.  Therapies definitely improving. need make sure hospital capacity used. Pretty sure reason even worn mask recently gave one presidential seal it. Imagine working Walmart mask rule starts Monday.

Basically saying, keep switching positions things benefit views essentially grabbing knife ends pretending still use cut, reality end cutting guess rhetorical question part, others would read comment. definitely goes hive mind.

I would hope already working security, know confrontations coming. #deathsantis Even flu vaccine misses strains, yet immune system benefits vaccine. Sweden defends COVID strategy even mortality rate greater 100x worse New Zealand, Slovakia, Singapore, Australia, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, etc wasn‚Äôt trump. someone else white house wrote piece didn‚Äôt permission white house so. white house distancing author. Cold, Dry air. Less vitamin sun. Less active time, fewer hours UV.

These things combined favors immune system ease transmission. Uh, okay? think mattered live purpose post, basically affirming walking good stress. mean, say need 70% long term immunity. Idk long term part, seems air somewhat.

I mean herd immunity work without vaccine, antibodies people get infected would strong enough last long while, virus move place place forever (like colds flus now).

Herd immunity really thing created vaccines. Mary Trump hang drink beers together.  defintely hasn‚Äôt experience. Hating body kept exercising worried looking ugly ridiculous. hating body wanting healthy/live long made start exercising far consistently vigorously ever before. Nordics, ethnic ones, quite stubborn. They‚Äôre also quite entitled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always done way. change?‚Äù weird thing they‚Äôre obedient complying unless change something.

Nevermind. feel bad Chuck‚Äôs son getting virus hope survives.

I also feel bad Chuck‚Äôs son self-serving asshole father. Honest question: know numbers correct ~95% (im getting number county) getting hospitalized? know assessed. practice, viruses known able cause serious damage (my grandpa died age 30 due heart damage Scarlet Fever he'd 20 years before). COVID anecdotes, young, fit people reporting difficulty walking stairs long ""recovering,"" getting chronic fatigue syndrome. articles posted damage found asymptomatic people well.

It's enough reason get infected purpose, least. look excess deaths. much different five year average?

Rest peace.  money. dispute. Someone know posted grandfather 10 positive tests therefore counted 10 times positive case. say cases (i.e. individual patients) states tally positive tests. Others saying it‚Äôs case count positive test go saying bad numbers say wiling say screw it, I‚Äôm going mask-less. So, numbers individual cases positive tests? Correlation =/= causation. there's correlation people higher Vitamin lower severity response mean one depends other. 

The problem virus weak immune system, overactive immune system response. Sunshine, diet, exercise can't change that. day start trust US media media. Thanks letting us know clue current situation. always believed ideals America. opinion, nothing luck size national character. entire system built good ideas. fact abandoned idea decided flexible, took advantage could... That's destroying us.

I'm saying US exceptional. We've made lot mistakes. We're hardly alone taking advantage native populations slavery happened awful something stamp wherever happens. issues unique. inevitable part process gaining power acceptable time (to ruling groups least). learned still learning trying recover barbaric thinking. Thought evolving. need compassion past. know know. true now.

You cannot read founding documents feel awe wonder advanced ideas freedom put forth time. idea great, execution leaves something desired sometimes.

Unfortunately, independent streak seem backfired crisis.

You argue policy course. politicians terrible, ideas supposed foundation good. .02. I'm advocating teen drinking irresponsible drinking, yeah. definitely teenagers enjoy drinking alcohol. Whoa! When/ where? Walmart saying that, yet go dont enforce all. Customers w.o masks employees taking time.   know someone whose best friend died COVID he‚Äôs still anti mask See, there's difference saying antibodies going attack cells saying might exagerated immune response harm good. 

Antibodies protein recognise specific protein (an antigen), basically tells rest immune system ""hey look this"". antibodies created cell knows make specific antibody, way learns make exposure protein. basically body saying ""shit really fucked last time, know need make beat it, protein here, let's attack that"". no, antibodies created vaccine will, definition, recognise specific protein, virus dont antibody cannot possibly attack host cells, protein recognizes exist host cells. 

What happens autoimmune diseases whole different beast, body actually produces antibodies cells (it happen often specific regulatory mechanisms negative selection get into), that's situation all. 

I hope clear, Immunology easiest explain text.

Lastly, downvote comment.  Death harm disease cause. perfectly capable, be, testing everyone often unlikely players catch virus playing. 

Again, question whether can, taking many resources Lol exactly! I‚Äôm it! That's point. Warehouse workers already enduring harsh conditions pandemic really choice. Even may risk Covid-19, still need package deliver Bezos's packages. ...and needs money.

Sadly whole thing become political. feel superior point finger someone else blame them. twitter comments reply anything Governor says nothing cesspool ignorance. fact matter bluest youngest parts Ohio largely fault.

Sweden used argument left right US. Sweden, peddling fear lockdowns, countering (equally stupid) arguments right, going ""Sweden nothing they're fine"". I‚Äôm Illinois (in Chicago area). Generally, mask compliance good, cases relatively low. positivity rate hovers around 3 percent.

Mormon church literally asking people wear masks state less active 400 cases, falling weeks now. epidemiologist would argue shutting us ably maintaining cases extremely low level. need federal investment testing, PPE, contact tracing, mask enforcement economic aid.

What point ill-informed, overheated theatrics like petition 'listen Fauci CDC' would well? Inflenza virus infects enough year, proven reinfects. took time come conclusion.

I also agree bad testing real.

Both possible , less plausible one other, binary situation. opinion, plausible could 5 things going once. said wrong. point view lot Poor people going die. Fuck him. want know anyone putting Giannis Antetokounmpo risk playoffs get underway want handled. testing everyone hand. happen I'm sorry üòû Americans smart enough follow guidelines; we'd better place. Thanks part problem. Karen, there‚Äôs reason attorneys you‚Äôve called expensive- it‚Äôs think you‚Äôre going lose. Yup waiting govt mandate customers wouldn‚Äôt angry. 

Didn‚Äôt happen govt hoping different level government would mandate it, never happened. hoping stores would mandate it, didn‚Äôt happen plan testing everyone regularly, like football Europe has.

The main question whether it, whether SHOULD, considering pandemic going worsen get flu season (and heart NFL campaign) hope sake theres bullshit accepted rule. Put mask correctly get fuck out. literally dont need money. Face covering maginal benefit best. Ill never understand Reddits mask fetish. best way stop stay fuck away ppl.

So test people symptoms? spread 1. Perhaps one process, don‚Äôt recall one ever coming successful. 

2. we‚Äôre thinking thing, agree they‚Äôve working while, initial focus shifted towards pandemic hit. Which. again. We‚Äôve never proper coronavirus vaccine. 

3. I‚Äôm Anti-Vaxx whatsoever. I‚Äôm caught shots. vaccine rushed out. doesn‚Äôt spell good news. Nevada reporting record high current hospitalizations (806), record high new daily cases record high positivity rate (17%). That's really really good. religious classes 5:30 morning, ""release time"" thing Ohio rather literally starve half country death instead? guess might deal Coronavirus. fail see theory hold considering Wuhan situation. mysterious virus spread Asia except Wuhan church Seoul??

People choice. comply enter and... well go elsewhere.

Mandatory masks everywhere fine. choice matter. Non-hospitalized gonna like roadhouse! nice time nice masks probably cost $0.50 less buy bulk, turning customer away one means give $0 profits shopping, makes sense willing lose fifty cents per mask.

and legit crazy observe. imagine going local supermarket gun pulled mentally deranged cunt, somehow living denial virus killed 600k humans, wanna wear mask (insert entitled excuse) There's reason vote half way :) Kinda, lightweight plastic shield ""headband"" top. 

 Even true substantial portion deaths happened before, going continue happen? CDC lags 8 weeks death reporting. means we'll bit slow see emerging patterns. What's likely happening surge deaths started weeks ago get lot worse. Wednesday (probably): Hold beer Living south see constant stream anti-mask nonsense, they've basically gone saying healthy saying ""it's control."" want solely government telling to. didnt even knew spanish flu existed Even that‚Äôs true. $$$s crash regardless; costs lives unnecessarily slightly postpones economic hit.

It‚Äôs really Trump ass kissing. Yes, question go route. you‚Äôre going people round arrested/escorted property. know ""cautiously"" means? Australia get script doctor, usually visit pharmacy buy vaccine return doctor administer it. Last part free, really nothing stopping walking out! peculiar odor around data Florida time,‚Äù said Dr. William Hanage, associate professor epidemiology Harvard‚Äôs T.H. Chan School Public Health.

Similar odor coming WH take case reporting/editing CDC. Nothing? Conversation publicly exposed piece shit. even doubled another comment showing yet another way piece shit. I've already humiliated you, lack proper response exposes genuinely fucking stupid. people know mouth breathing fucking moron. 

My question self aware enough even understand lost?  yup air particles come noses shouldn't. dad promoting unsafe behaviour. Increases everyones chance get sick. call Karma direct cause effect. virus, despite nasty relentless, given us enough leeway. China's response couple weeks late, managed quench spread. South Korea superspreading events churches quickly regained control. initial response Itlay, Spain, many countries Europe total cluster fuck, couple months' struggle seeing degree normality.

I wanna end punchline hey hey, Texas bad Florida. Texas admits bad there. care. Florida straight says there's problem here; everything's fine. Yessss! Wonderful news. Household transmission around (I remember seeing one said 19% couldn‚Äôt find it). mean Gerbes too? week ago directly said lockdowns would next step numbers improve... well Maury Povich would say ""we determined, lie.""

Call anti-masker, silly little names want. No-one right force anything want do, especially name stopping virus lethality rate that's long ago proven like .01%.

Can't believe people still buying Covid nonsense. Funny people forgot well month world wide riots/protests, fits narrative magically concern more. Exactly. hospitals going destroy data. Trump delaying inevitable (probably even long), he's absolutely handicapping CDC (which course terrible) historical/future study purposes data still exist. Trump simply competent enough enough power local levels pull coverup magnitude. Actually one positive side effect private system, since government servers hospitals operate data. 

Whether anybody even cares 2 years data re-aggregated analyzed another matter. would still help lot. would protect hospitals overwhelmed, spread would slow, getting herd immunity via remainder naturally infected slowly time would less catastrophic now. Anti-vax people worry, I'm *dreadfully* worried them. First withdraw WHO, undermine CDC. excited check publicfreakouts Tuesday, ughhhhh it‚Äôs like Christmas!!  Interesting. think hippy Trader Joe's would first ones mask up. Maybe anti-vax...or dont want drama 'gonna need 14 FEMA portable morgues then. actually want see Fox News reports never thought I'd say that. fucking time. Fred Meyers' around telling employees can't ask customers leave, try enforce states mask order, make sort comment wearing mask customers wearing one. Fucking Kroger/Fred Meyers!  took 6 months really want make fun want fall karma trap fell into. Hopefully son gets better stops spouting tactless conspiracy theory BS. Canadian owns small business, say economy MUCH better we‚Äôre dying Covid. air conditioning season ( i've they've literally everywhere ) plus japanese used wear masks sick, mostly winter, probably something weird even wear summer. 

Not weird, definitely pain due risk heatstroke.

White House full non experts need offer reasonable accommodation. Curbside pickup wearing face shield instead qualify reasonable accommodations case. use employees wearing masks customers give fucks?
I'll start caring actually enforce policy customers, stop firing people quarantine ""performance"" get thermometers read 93.5 every morning ect. use vaping smoking devices. Thanks explaining. read studies student, never knew phases trial like real life/how participants volunteer.

How think works coronavirus vaccine trial? need healthy patients volunteer exposed, right? Phase 3 Brazil started 20th June, 2 6 months given estimated time results Oxford press release. Note, say 6 months considered fast phase 3. dates South Africa British trials started, guessing around time.

Filing registration would fast tracked (weeks) production particular vaccine begun. 

 

Regarding production, details vague official channels, apparently agreement Brazil estimates delivery 15 million doses Dec 2020 rest Jan 2021. I'd assume would first batch.

Many people many parts world like *United States*, problem individual travelers therefrom. Wouldn‚Äôt prepare current pandemic first? 10 min tests people need Damn. Thank reply. Well administration trying redirect data CDC directly start hiding numbers. know what's coming upcoming weeks. I'm beginning think masks also reminder things changed, people can't handle it. Coping change something counselors specialize in, all. need many people can't handle it, even short time.  mexico too, mandatory masks major supermarkets along temperature check hand sanitizer. surprises badly US handling this. sneeze demonstrative. 

Eat garlic. Go talk wife. Talk mask on, off. Ask one smells more. Well, yeah, goes without saying. think Fauci awesome, unhappy he's admitted fibbing masks (which bought anyway, treat us like idiots [even many are])... got backwards, bud.

Should keep wasting money therapy work, swallow pills make feel better, live life never wanted? what?

You say people recover glad did, people don't? people go decades wanting end it, stick around cuz idiots like lie say gets better, NEVER GETS BETTER? I'd imagine everyone successfully commits perfectly content decision. 

And no, I'm going ask know anything, care. you, myself, anyone god awful world. right, know single thing you. mean want good things happen you.

A lot companies expediting trials Phase I/II trials time pushing Phase III already put risk level expediency.

For starters, may enough data efficacy vaccine. Even create vaccine end year create distribute enough doses achieve ‚Äòherd immunity‚Äô minimum 70% population 5 billion doses.

There also way vaccine development doesn‚Äôt get politicized. Countries resources expedite vaccine development use vaccine bargaining chip needed.

Unfortunately someone actually told something like that. Can‚Äôt argue idiots. takes someone love/care get sick die first, unfortunately. news headline would see plague Inc.

Like said, pros cons.  cons probably outweigh pros. certainly right now. Thought masked shopper pulled gun unmasked man ask wear mask. Disappointed. two rows benches games resume. Masks required sitting first row (though coaches encouraged wear one anyway). Masks required second row, however, unless player active.

But expensive labs get less business run slowly.

You definitely buy way faster testing, given cash. great ""my body choice"" ""every life matters"" party switch way though, coming fall fault Wal- Mart management marketing. marketing focuses almost exclusively types folks...well gonna bite every time. 

Glad mom working anymore. Probably gonna mass shootings there. Hope workers OK. Yes, it‚Äôs true. redundant seems, method needs applied equally all. matter simple hypothesis. everyone Europe wearing masks, one Wales in, virus control anyway.

Because people stayed home, stopped socialising people. literally straight forward.... need mask leaving home walk around supermarket week, never closed metres anyone else!

Would love know people planning breaking social distancing much wearing mask would make anything negligible difference case rates. Pondering DeSantis genuinely blinded stupidity ideology he's putting act. ASAP? Yeah. also blew mind phone, Google Firefox trading information me. know personal data sold time, 48 hour timeframe browser competitors, freaky. Virus mutating losing antibody two separate things respect country, community citizens, would respect Canada? Keep border shut. part true. Many parents dont know help kid learn. Weve seen action. kids couldnt located month. kids weeks weeks would go response phone calls. USA ""wearing fucking mask"" appear complicated simple minds.

I also mentioned ""hiring security staff"" ""training them"". 

I actually expect bloodshed Monday, inside outside doors Walmart stores.  believe fool, troll, y'all. Meant say extreme shit flare people's emotions. know data badly needed timely manner develop best plan action hard time trying understand anyone would want change way data reported already processed efficient manner.

I‚Äôm right it‚Äôs you. don‚Äôt know they‚Äôd cut speculate. Since seems essential plan action began suspect maybe assumption false actually isn‚Äôt plan action.  Trump messed Country much four years, we‚Äôre literally turn try fix it. Apparently met least 35% populace... üòû get fired tempted another job offer, resign get picked up, yeah. Bad bot NYC zip code data bares well, believe. makes blood boil ‚Äúlive it‚Äù enthusiasts completely ignore countless successful interventions mitigated spread. Two? Three? ...because decade might problem. Need? Already happened, months already killed asking someone wear mask type single word I'm Google usually first result definition lol It‚Äôs ok, gets hot virus go away, like miracle. Ok good! Thanks! Also, look ""CARES"" Act too...there may something help...unemployment personal time etc. PA waved ""look work"" requirement &amp; hours cut fear getting virus health/health others household, apply. words...don't let school district b.s. way!!! nothing. won't, though. flu-esque virus cannot compared flu Spanish Flu. Despite fact CFR (the number always inflated) Covid19 2-5 times less IFR Spanish Flu (depending numbers used), allegedly impact (again, raw number lives lost, percentage people killed). despite improved understanding medicine, viral spread, measures take.

It's new virus. get it. taking seriously. completely unfair compare Spanish Flu Covid-19, honestly cheapens lives lost potentially lost so. constantly exaggerating effect Covid, saying think lives lost important enough warrant certain measures.

Masks? Sign up. Temporary lockdown deal this? Alright, I'll go along. lie think heartless willing adjust behaviour protect lives? Fuck off. Thought would way that. Businesses stress *private property* aspect decisions. Get fuck property can‚Äôt follow rules, go shop somewhere else. think that‚Äôs US election health insurance go hospital: Priceless
Having Health Insurance unable get tested: Hang there! cautious best sanitize. thing last forever. deserve take space ICUs. Wish could make ppl sign waiver forgo rights spot limited spaces people unfortunate enough get infected fools Right know difference treatment vaccine. many development hard keep track everything tests useful end year state tests schools. time know results, late anything them. Please help, know right thing is...

I'm healthcare worker, treat patients might covid. required tested symptomatic five days.

I surgery month can't miss. I'm afraid job puts risk contracting covid, would cancel surgery. fear outcome causing stress handle anymore.

What do? Tell doctor? Tell boss? I'd like know right thing is. One, work towards acceptable outcome. Two, bc want bullied less.

Thanks. State California btw find out? .... what. say that? dont recall disputing science. called dude saying fear mongering. love football go without greater good. Whoever argues football make money escape reality. local Walmart almost always local police officer it, maybe help. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Yeah, come now. Dig heels little harder! Alright, let‚Äôs agree, scientific backing thoughts, pseudo-facts... comment one those!

Please wear face covering public, literally logical reason to. many students would go grandparents older relatives house cousins. knowledge never illegal. even brief time daycares closed families still work alot kids would go either family member friends home. government. ""libruls.""  Vietnam control here. virus going shed enough surfaces infect you.

ETA: saw Norway. That's good!  Ummm think ambulance wait long 10 hours, little much press fodder Covid: got wish... ‚ÄúI feel threatened! feel threatened!!!‚Äù Hey there. feel now? I'd say smart people know they're smart subject, intellectual humility.

Narcissistic idiots tend know they're stupid pretend know see sign humility weakness even they're wrong never admit makes feel inferior stupid really rest cements opinion stupid are. Look, that‚Äôs fine. could done lot better. saying mask mandate, way back May, true everywhere US. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs I‚Äôm tired narrative goes ‚ÄúIdiot Governor, Idiot State‚Äù. Parts state handled pandemic different ways. Shelby Co advised whole time group really smart Drs. UT St. Jude, ones spearheaded free testing on-site lab work, leadership city mostly followed advice. 

But another thing can‚Äôt keep people stupid. Kids aged 20-30 gonna go bars, parties, whatever, get infected. That‚Äôs true here, it‚Äôs true NY, California, Miami wherever. I‚Äôm tired ‚Äúour state better yours‚Äù narrative. cashier, confirm. People throwing carts door people. take long get fda approved? thought would part would take least time phase 3 results would good. think realistic timeline vaccine able distributed? can't either. 100% understand annoying particularly wanting to. find annoying really want wait red lights lines get 6 get ready XD represented exactly people major cities are. That‚Äôs fair. electoral college thing, entire states majority vote wouldn‚Äôt matter. plenty Republicans California. party popular majority people, maybe party broaden ideals become popular? I‚Äôd say even Democrat, tables turned way. 

1 person = 1 vote fair, matter are. Quit pitting rural America vs. urban America. Thursday (probably): Hold Beer Chinese community Italy... You‚Äôre acting like Black Death something lol  imagine he'll retire Pandemic Trump gone. like Tony Stark end End Game. finally defeated monster closet.  Por que los dos? Schools aren‚Äôt giving teachers option. we‚Äôre coming ideal hypothetical situations lot better solve issue offering leave absences teachers want it. Soccer Hockey actually result lot concussions too. comes sport We're good thanks. :) Wow unacceptable scary! got tested month ago results came back day. live Vermont. I‚Äôm curious take DUIs.

Christians take faith seriously using safe practices, sakes sake around them, least months now. Probably peeps fleeing Coronazona. virus know state borders. NY bunch states around strategy place deal virus. Nah worry. new data reporting system make deaths magically disappear.  Sam's club already sign front seen anyone new hired enforce it. town pretty chill though 99% people come masks anyway. everyone wore mask would even need shit economy down. Look Japan. one gives fuck PR optics.  Masks reduce transmission rates 80%. Period. End story.  motivations companies enforcing rules matter one iota.  anything retailers starting realize hard pandemic going hurt bottom line neither workers customers keep stores operational. Rookie numbers Usually start become available late august october depending are. example mom (65+ kids -pediatrician get august) see generally available around late september/ october Ok gov cuomo. definitely think professional sports coming back extreme Covid precautions could provide distraction helps people remain good spirits distancing. College football hand compensate players, funding take extreme precautions protect players. Glad hear it! get great Karen videos!

... guess lives may saved also. Watching Florida popcorn buttered ready. going prison risky choice...who knew? feel. smoke? lowers amount oxygen system. get hold another Pulse Oximeter might faulty. usually say -/+ 2% them, however working hospital loads knocking around.

We also make Patient sit relax while. aim 5 minutes, engage banter. Try that. sit down, relax take it.

If concerns please see GP. Coffins 'inside' read comment history. massive moron. even gonma waste time you. quick search day found four studies said wearing mask caused headaches and/or dizziness test subjects, doctors. Two pregnant women, one N95 use doctors (cited Stanford publication), Turkish study showed surgical masks decreased oxygen levels caused headaches/dizziness. least one study said oxygen levels decreased 20%. People suffocated sheets blankets, course masks could effect breathing people. That's week today though, wtf!? OP smoke? disorder like sleep apnea? Something like cause lower reading many Americans wearing masks, move Walmart probably lead number employees killed assaulted anti maskers. We‚Äôve already employees stores shot killed telling customers wear mask. It‚Äôs obvious comment don‚Äôt understand masks work, provide protection it‚Äôs 100%, people around aren‚Äôt wearing masks that‚Äôs problem, it‚Äôs problem too. amount people asking Facebook page they'll make exceptions ""disabilities make wearing masks impossible"" astounding.

You disability allow wear mask. don't, unless made disability created head. know guy literally one lung. trouble wearing one annoyance. people insane.  can't make stuff up! ill-informed buffoon! former Atlantian, pay cash money Murder Kroger mask Nice George Carlin reference Shake dust feet. Honestly USA, point think disparate set country-states stick border crossers quarantine camps time allowed entry. decent testing, I'd say Germany doing, that's possible 14 day wait times. 

What else given government putting national anti-epidemiologist propaganda? USA: that's cute.  damn time. bad gonna make work's jobs lot harder since they'll deal Karens men children.  use public toilet. Poor retail workers... Thank you, feel like I‚Äôm going insane. I‚Äôm fine wear mask 90% time work outdoors gets 90 I‚Äôm moving lot feels like I‚Äôm trying breathe straw. mask gets wet exhaling sweating.

Good job ronny Let‚Äôs see numbers like month current hotspots go criticizing say. literally makes mad cracks time masks haven‚Äôt made mandatory since day one! It‚Äôs like we‚Äôve months mull decided yes, pandemic bad enough people public wear mask. Like actual fuck. summary [a post last reproduced full convenience.

Here‚Äôs timeline.

April 28th: ‚ÄúLet\[‚Äòs\] make clear. I‚Äôm buying fucking mask. I‚Äôve made far buying damn hype‚Äù

June 13th: ‚ÄúRound 2!‚Äù checks Put-In-Bay, island Ohio hotels, resorts, water recreation.

Again June 13th: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs packed‚Äù captions picture swimming pool, poolside packed people social distancing, masks sight.

June 15th: ‚ÄúWe got vodka drank sand bar music playing!!‚Äù Accompanies check-in S&amp;M Bar 3 friends.

July 1st: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve sick past days. Symptoms Covid-19. morning finally got swabbed. know soon results are. want feel good again!‚Äù

In answer comment ‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt Bay week ago?‚Äù (In context ‚Äòthe Bay‚Äô referring ‚ÄòPut-in-Bay‚Äô) responds following.

‚ÄúA weeks ago yes‚Äù ‚ÄúI seriously think that‚Äôs contracted test positive‚Äù

Later July 1st: ‚ÄúWell. I‚Äôm officially quarantine next 14 days. tested positive COVID-19. Sucks started new job!‚Äù

July 2nd: ‚ÄúThis covid shit sucks! I‚Äôm breath sitting here.‚Äù

July 3rd: ‚ÄúWhen see heaven don‚Äôt shit judgmental pricks.‚Äù (This content meme, original commentary individual)

July 4th: Dead.

‚Äî

Two friend reactions worth highlighting.

After diagnosis death, formatting original formatting.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry! feel like asshole downplaying one people sick!‚Äù - Christy Parks

After death, reacting last meme posted

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think would make laugh one day next day I‚Äôm filled grief. Rest heaven, one good guys.‚Äù - unidentifiable friend.

‚Äî

A person, friends family hopes dreams, died, learn it.

First, back April attributes getting disease ‚Äúnot buying damn hype.‚Äù Coronavirus know think feel pandemic, care. individual got exactly backwards, attributed non-infection behavior increased risk, instead correctly assigning statistical probability. resident Ohio, lower risk infection back April state government moved swiftly Mike DeWine lockdown protect citizens. probability encountering COVID-19 positive person contracting disease lowered proper public health response ignoring issue.

Emboldened complete misread protecting him, agitated removal basic common sense precautions engaging riskiest behaviors know of, crowded water recreation drinking bar (not specified indoors not). put risk, ultimately ended life, assertion contracted virus June 13th, coupled anti-mask stance, correct went infect unknown number patrons June 15th S&amp;M Bar. is, however, reason think individual, already displayed deficiency cause effect reasoning, correct presume know infected. suffices say pattern behavior put greater risk infection infecting others, delay onset symptoms wanton disregard others, highly likely circulate public infected.

His social circle deems ‚Äúone good guys.‚Äù Good people intentional put others‚Äô health risk. Good people not, conscious actions, cause deaths innocent people. actions may made ‚Äúgood guy‚Äù throughout life, decided valuable enough protect personal belief virus would reward resistance ‚Äúbuy hype‚Äù desire ‚Äúfeel good‚Äù greatly outweighed civic duty fellow countrymen get sick kill them. actions good person, actions ignorant, selfish, dangerous individual.

It‚Äôs illustrative friend, Christy Parks, would highlight lack care group others, sociopathic nature worldview.

‚ÄúI feel like asshole downplaying one people sick!‚Äù

Do feel like asshole downplaying disease responsible millions sick 130k+ dead. Yes, ‚Äúone people sick!‚Äù That‚Äôs original emphasis, capitalized ‚ÄúMY‚Äù highlight important factor is. Americans stricken ill, die choking lungs, don‚Äôt matter. ‚ÄúMY‚Äù people get sick disease real.

Selfish, ignorant people unable unwilling comprehend actions keeping safe putting others risk. Recklessly putting innocent people harms way direct actions day bay night bar, without masks freedom.

I nothing contempt them. Speaking shamed Arizonan... severe lack quality education, leading distrust misunderstanding science tendency vote interests working-class citizen. change quickly stores able function due customers getting workers sick. Damn millennials *checks notes* spending money tourism probably either manager pay wish gold. brilliant way put Thanks questions! Here's podcast answers questions want give I‚Äôm masks, also don‚Äôt care someone chooses wear one. pro mask people explain LA County explosion cases?  Yes worse. NY least tried implement restrictions. Abbott sacrificing you. Good luck ya'll. People dumb state mind. hit hard one knew happening brought numbers down. Let‚Äôs see Texas Florida Arizona even come close handling way NYS dug hole.

Negative, one member still cough month later. Let development plan may find answers regarding transportation. media hero Fauci? province lawyers/law services considered essential (very things seemed non-essential seems). never shutdown. okay actual non-essential shutdown people initially cautious could lock self office (and one story building elevators). Courts shutdown except emergency hearings. courts mostly remote applications person. Masks public areas courtrooms. still court proceedings remotely.

My office ‚Äúeveryone it‚Äù shit show. moved Phase 2 province everyone office seems decided permission get lax precautions including distancing office - go gather dozens relatives friends Saturday come work Monday. one wearing mask - including meet clients coming essential one paying attention - take office door closed eat drink still air conditioned office.

I work home last couple weeks surgery (had cancelled lockdown) want jeopardize. someone actually gets sick office potentially exposes *everyone*, apparently going keep going. get anxious going office everyday one else seems care all. could easily work home - us evenings, weekends, sick days, vacations...so sure resistance now.

Meanwhile, active cases city increasing again... Might want put accuracy criteria well..... flu COVID. Good luck everyone! Put list people curious see goes. ventured Walmart recently, long story, state already mandates everyone must wear mask indoors. signs posted outside various places detailing fact masks legally required must cover nose mouth. Yet, inside store, numerous customers masks even folks masks mouths pulled nose.

I think real change come mandatory mask wearing policies put place local governments retailers. People still resist, get hungry eventually forced comply. Yeah, could acted way back March, April, May make plan reopen safely. And, know, get virus controlled important things could open safely.. namely schools.. God great PR team Based thread conversation I've started - Apparently people would send kids school hot zone taking care children never something intended doing. moment can't send someone else deal 8 hours per day, society breaks know it. Fauci admitting lied..Maybe good reason, still, seriously harmed whole mask debate beginning. protocol place successful return sports.

Ahh well. fun ride either way. also this, published right wing cackled ""endorse beans worry statues."" Gallows humor pulling through.

Secondly (and would thought obviously) healthcare workers come contact WHOLE lot infected people average person. sort nature job. going around sick people time entire work day, infections. mask helps, magical force field.

Published July 13, 2020 6:14 PM incredulous WH actually makes kinds statements; even gobsmacked Americans let get away it. Scopes ~~Monkey Climate~~ Covid Trial. wanted combat, signed well iraq war realized bullshit endeavor. I've even outright tell liked idea acting like military power steals countries bosses others around back unclear US going steal iraqi oil. I've met happy idea corporations ones profit military action - fact one basically viewed role combat helping ensure economy stayed strong, I've met wanted kill brown people seemed, I've met sorts soldiers fully aware worldwide repercussions joining military.

That terrifying. soldiers, ones sign get bad economic situation, sound sociopathic. ever knew any, I'd hard time feeling sad died combat. covid-19 cases rise

who would expected see time back first started? Good burn. Knocked one park slugger.

If options birth control. Oh, wait. let ask then: think expect vaccine released public end pandemic all? September? October? January? March? 

I said last night post, I‚Äôm supposed heading college attend on-campus five weeks (definitely science major, obviously). live Texas, pretty much fire right now. I‚Äôd love go on-campus, virus seems wish that. I‚Äôm also football fan. college ball and/or pro ball would suck. vaccine roll (or even in) September, could everything return back normal? least we're coming around idea science devil. start. Honestly like?? barely even plans, plans half baked. would anyone send kid school hot zone Finally Lol Wtf, people crazy  can‚Äôt fix doesn‚Äôt acknowledge No. This. taken directly looking incomplete data, check date another week two. arguments/tantrums reported. guy pulled gun Florida Walmart lot people going schools open. essential=disposable Also highest death rate. Check Florida's 7-day running average deaths: moon-shot. Presumably curve continue slope!

And ranking states per capita deaths. Florida rising fast: NB, we're currently least strict phase available us vaccine. Restaurants open dining half capacity, take name number track necessary. 

For places, masks everywhere can't socially distance. They're still limiting number people stores enforcing one-way aisles. theatres such, public gatherings 50. socialize family friends.

I'm okay handled here, although it'll always irk made masks mandatory exactly one day succumbing public pressure reversing decision. I've thinking heading Canada residential purposes! want stay winning team! influence operation run course, next phase ""it's late anything, time live it"" I‚Äôve never even seen Kroger. south store? turn head away far can, put fist mouth, breath fast close eyes, seems distract enough needles bad start tomorrow? wait week? Trump: Hold beer. Ty! about: Let‚Äôs see numbers like month current hotspots go giving awards. Smart guy figured This. Source: best friend Walmart manager hired bouncer this. Walmart‚Äôs something know it‚Äôs problem Abbott guy (rightfully) sued company caused accident disabled him... passed law people can't sue types accidents.

No, know cares act, I'll see mention Americans dying anyone else Yup! Many people know fairly responsible...they wear masks. also, they‚Äôve returned sports, fairly large get togethers, plan sending kids back school want football homecoming happen ‚Äúwe going get it‚Äù, don‚Äôt social distance etc. we‚Äôre talking cases try stay topic Well they're trying reinvent oil natural gas moguls international business hub. Which, inevitably bring covid cases coming unless drastic intake procedures.  OTOH, Merck FUD (Fear, Uncertainity, Doubt) behind vaccine race? Kroger really biggest? always assumed walmart also already used 10 weeks lockdown. NY would similar struggles lockdown again. Locking areas twice tricky.  So, lose home unable eat? What‚Äôs wrong you? ‚Äúnobody humps take test wear condom‚Äù Texan here.
It appears is. Poor ""unfortunate deal this"", poor ""low income"". think country totally fine killing children, ourselves, others...

Because change scarier death. Covid denying Americans unison: *This way* Lol Omg watched like 3 videos back back. first one popped ‚Äúfat A-hole‚Äù haha. asked put cart back acted like insulted. course. They'll say ""we made 6.6 billion lliom pay many claims. Now, since pay claims, well make 5.5 billion. raise rates make difference!"" Ah like Dust. Already utmost hygiene

Can't quit, that's insurance Im shocked wasnt tbh! media feeds mouths little much. Attack Karens concur, concurred  

Edit: concur?  Found - deleted comment ‚Äúgood thing deaths down‚Äù, (not death *rate*) change up. Yes credit, *nobody* getting windmill cancer right now. People getting sick dying for-profit enterprise. surprise health insurance companies making big bucks millions people getting sick? 

If reason rein runaway profiteering ""healthcare industrial complex"" create truly nonprofit healthcare providers goal saving peoples lives efficiently, profit...i know is. college worked grocery store later restaurant always delighted rare opportunity arose tell guests ‚Äúsorry, no‚Äù, coworkers. probably would‚Äôve fighting door duty hope beans

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs safe solution it‚Äôs something team owner would consider. Seems stupid, lot happen seven dayz. supposed touch masks all, reuse disposable masks. CDC still doesn‚Äôt right guidelines wear masks. Lol Scranton area someone NAZI PIG WOLF sign yard. Reminds manbearpig words typed words replying to? 

Oh wait answer that, absolutely nothing. Come on, dude. Bars closed. don‚Äôt serve food serve alcohol closed. think would possible even move Tokyo Olympics 2022. year already busy sporting year FIFA World Cup, Asian Games (second-largest international multi-sport event Olympics), Winter Olympics happening within months other. Tokyo 2021 still possible they'll probably scrap completely. Shhh say naughty u word. Yes,karma isnt real life thing lol Deaths skyrocket. RIP don‚Äôt envy nursing home directors. easy decisions make.

I imagine isn‚Äôt easy position choose locking nursing home down, banning visitors, knowing full well mean slipping standards care many die alone. median amount time patient spends nursing home death 5 months. Imagine less 5 months live, could told would never see loved ones again, would lower chance getting virus 1 20 chance killing you. would feel that? easy decision nursing home director make. 

My sister works locked one says absolute misery there. Family can‚Äôt help care like usually do, volunteers aren‚Äôt allowed help minimize chance comes in. conditions, impossible give standard care used to, knowing full well don‚Äôt anything live anymore, since activities visits cancelled, many patients don‚Äôt even get bed anymore, languishing rest lives away lonely bed. easy decision make.

The highest risk also negatively effected shutdowns. point ""one size fit all"" doctor understand that. Every science fiction show this. Well, was....something. picker left area someone stocked it. seriously think everything stock always going shelf home take time fill outs?  People like main reason people involved online grocery burn quickly. Unmasked man needs spend time Prison, free wear mask, catch COVID-19 inmates. Ok... would like use this. I‚Äôm Central Valley California it‚Äôs full morons. mandate MUST wear mask. Shit even Costco‚Äôs stopped enforcing it. wanted call couple people ultimately tell fuck off, left with. either catch hands turn away. Seeing like ‚Äúmuh freedums‚Äù go grab employee. feel bad constantly police people. think would nice security cop high traffic areas climate right now, doesn‚Äôt seem like good idea. Anyway, sorry rambling. there's room hope subreddit Im atheist they're better nobody, point ""one size fit all"" doctor understand that. What's more, vast majority working age impoverished unemployed. Historically, raising minimum wages tended increase number impoverished reduces likelihood someone disadvantaged backgrounds (say, inner city kids) progress social ladder. Trump going fire him. see coming. Looks like I'm going shopping Kroger!  Reddit moment. Lol delaying inevitable South, illegal white woman marry black man. law wrong.

Putting people prison smoking joint also wrong. think that‚Äôs problem. many Americans half brain less... ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt breathe!‚Äù Start employees. Every time go Kroger half fuckers rocking chinstrap. yeah Dogg hates Good Walmart. Saw coworker Walmart week ago gave shit wearing mask there. 

Fucking Corona University there, course I‚Äôm going wear mask moron. U.S. dominating bigly Yes Washington side looking betrayed People make choice go prison

Almost one chose deserve exactly asked for

Most non violent crimes asked starve die. deserve bread corona? Love love **love** news! time full-frontal assault Invisible Enemy. Where‚Äôs Barry Allen need him? Many items truly stock. point time picker looking item home empty someone likely going stocking within hours.  missing anything important go buy yourself.  assume people busting ass pick order know doing.  Many issues beyond control fault. lot better am. run 5-6 every weekday night tried mask could breathe. Hiking OK, 2 hours prob, running tried begin would passed (clearly understood going set relax catch breath). Look triggered disability would make hard wear mask anyway?

Mostly people severe lung capacity problems. (Corrections, additions, People sensory issues understand, 

I talked one person agreed masks panic attacks wore mask. pointed face shields said would likely can't wear mask trouble breathing it, outside first damn place!

Worse: lung problems, they're likely well catch COVID-19 curbside pickup looks ideal. Unless they're thoughtless liars trying stir conflict. Next week ""we never going back 2000 deaths per day"" Along : ""California really badly, Dems killing lot people like NY"".

I heard ""Surge south due visitors infected Northern States"" yesterday... Also- establishment bar (no food) close. That‚Äôs really biggest takeaway here. how‚Äôs recovery rate along many tests done day? Hawai‚Äôi we‚Äôve wearing masks awhile now. It‚Äôs like becoming normal day day fact, either wear mask fined allowed buildings. everyone acting high mighty, caring coronavirus precautions ingenious front, the're focused seeming self virtuous smug actually encouraging better habits.

Why I, plenty others, practice social distancing mask wearing without sniffing ass circlejerking stupid everyone else is? Walmart Southern Oregon one entrance available two workers handing masks could allowed in. Lol thinking ironic ...one day later. Finally! I'm getting serious ""Blade Runner"" SciFi dystopian vibe here. Hes going let chaos happen let people die one vote. pos literally sacrifice people win fact everyone complacent insane. media complains yet still spew message offer real opinions still go along  Definitely not. Anytime go anywhere (Southern Indiana) vast majority people maskless. painfully cringy. still story? X amount people X X amount got ‚ÄòVID. shit. people obviously aren‚Äôt learning it. would feel so... weird, open coughing like that. soon feel urge sneeze/cough, arm almost automatically goes up!! Dedicate cloud storage public freakouts  Compare Toronto GTA then. 8 million people, 49 cases.  See find one Etsy made African wax fabric. Definitely helps heat humidity. World meter 70k think health safety concern quite time. 

I wish everybody around world would needed, wear masks, isolate, stay clean, all. 

But know probable, possible. 

Sadly would take make better faster. I'm arguing that. I'm pointing Fred Meyers/Kroger gone way avoid enforcing masks areas currently required in.

 read rest comment? Kroger avoiding right thing entire time. said going enforce capacity limits? said nothing changed.

I think everyone wear masks, case believe Kroger looking Kroger. smoking disorder know of. state local governments provide support this? Either quit make sure everyone around wears mask wear mask treat surfaces contaminated mitigate risk. Stop alarmist, I'm sure they'll start ""gypsies"". That‚Äôs true. folks trust graphics found Facebook Twitter health professionals. 

Has anyone also noticed anti-mask people tend follow certain prototype person (conspiracy theorists, tends pro-Trump, anti-vaccine?) way convincing anything otherwise it‚Äôs ‚Äúfake news‚Äù part elaborate plan? disability would make hard wear mask anyway?

Conservatism Oof! people flee different state 

1. state separates non residents test results

2. They‚Äôd still LA county masks mandated.  One test subject testing theory particularly scientific. went walmart sams club today. saw plenty chinstraps exposed noses. good amount guilty employees. shit enforced all. Troops, man scooters. IL also hit 1k bunch times assumed precisely contact tracing. entire track trace system U.K. seems take place phone fucked planned app, would assume colleagues among easiest contacts trace manually. 

The U.K. government pretty much done bare minimum get away still juuuuust barely controlling things throughout pandemic far, doesn‚Äôt especially surprise they‚Äôre fussed risk higher environments easy track trace handle. Practice mindfulness Yea need escape good one agree you. imaginative. look opportunity get routineve .

been reading lot planting flowers exercising more. Ive always rode bike. etc actually works, read post /facepalm anti-masker facebook asked Trump made mask would wear response ""no!

I wouldn‚Äôt able live got Mum sick due negligence.  Can't lose election voters want control women make suffer. That's motivation.  does. 15k cases single day much different.  lmao got last part.

At least plague doctor gear would shield eyes and, (I assume), long beak filled herbs would least help capture larger particles liquid way in, out.

Also beginning outbreak, talking necessity N95 masks, quickly ran out. Since then, ""mask"" surgical cover, which, far understand, really stops larger particles liquid.

How effective reckon medieval plague doctor gear compared modern 3 ply surgical mask? sound pretty intelligent me, man. know work actually. I‚Äôm someone get upset someone else choice make. Regardless LA county surely anti science trumpian place. They‚Äôve also mandatory masks place quite time. explain seeing cases entire countries? people would go nuts Mexican immigrants? U.S. came way curve dark days April, we‚Äôre watching surge happen again. testing delays, emergency-room-nurse stories, refrigerated morgue trucks‚Äîthe first time tragedy, second time even greater tragedy. One must ask, without really wanting know answer, bad could round absolute per capita numbers, U.S. stands nearly country besides Iran large spring outbreak, began suppress virus, simply let virus come country world attempted U.S. appears stumbling into. Right now, many, many communities huge numbers infections. countries reached kind takeoff point viral spread, took drastic measures. Although states like California rolling back reopening, American states adamant opening teeth outbreak. level outbreak stay neatly within governor‚Äôs political boundaries. There‚Äôs way win state state, yet that‚Äôs exactly we‚Äôre attempting. look map, South West‚Äîregions combined 200 million people‚Äîare trouble.

great article worth full read. also, god help us understand objection lockdown, mask mandate?? want keep economy going, dont thing may enable it???

i dont understand republican thought process.....  Yup clue thanks letting know know fascism is. I‚Äôm wooshing response joke, fucking obviously referring fascism ‚Äúspoken‚Äù  Eh-oh, know train headed.

Blacks Jews next blame list it. imagine happy drug companies would test subject guy invented drug, research peer reviewed publication, none data reproduceable? Easy grab wheel chair Sell mask adds rather mandate. huge marketing opportunity here. American sheeople follow.

Git er done!

If, example, entire country longer bars, gyms, restaurants open may enough keep virus propagating anywhere near much. 5000 cases might take 4 months get 50k instead month. might even drop. issue support people work places? pay money maybe tax rest.

Second idea pummel cases hundreds, thousands, employ tracing tracking testing keep low. Personally think achievable 60%+ mask adherence strong social distancing measures, things could reopen, people could go back new sort normal. majority EU countries doing.

Let‚Äôs say state says, ‚ÄúWe emergency wear mask‚Äù (as California did). local government can‚Äôt come along say, ‚ÄúForget state said.‚Äù Generally, then, act Congress preempts state constitutions FDA ruling preempts state court rulings on.

So act Congress could bypass States entirely, add muscle government's ordering states mask up.

If look new deaths reported within previous 2 weeks, numbers steadily dropping past two months. There's second wave, fairly straight line down. take 3000 deaths April May move July, gives impression recent spike. could serious policy implications.

Also, understand might long lag early deaths, system overwhelmed unprepared, think reasonable expect reporting times faster now. Even dysfunctional system gets better experience.

Disney (and Universal, every theme park) could virus-safe autoclave, would still disaster. come time got hurts I'm New Hampshire taking chance told job out. every person dies, many lifelong conditions requiring regular care? thought Flumist showed us actually work. sure situation U.s Canada extra security places (most any, exception walmart) likely contend folks? family dumb keeps going nonessential reasons lets people come here. angry frustrated follow strict hygeine distancing standards try educate way. work. can't enough. Fuck me, man, kidding. That's fucking unfair, things keep getting piled like that. Jesus. make this, I'm never taking life freedoms granted.

Hear hear. pity many aspects COVID turned game political football, seems like opportunity people re-examine what's actually important life. hope gets point eventually, existing haze anger seems set since started tiring seems incredibly unimportant.

Stay strong, dude. hope best you, wife, kids. Fuck COVID. actually reject anyone coming though, try educate ones want wear mask. Nothing enforced. gonna do? Go Walmart LOL!! watch weekends? also remember known remedies March. drugs therapies know work death toll logically going lower. still worry naught hospitals get completely overwhelmed.  Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* There's part thinks media savvy lawyer ought start charging governors (or Trump admin) crimes American people. like famous Russell Tribunal. may actually lead admin jailed, would certainly provide opportunity inform public going inform crimes committed.  something would do, unlike dentist least people involved could wear masks. dentist mouth wide open someone else right face extended period time. Atm grocery store work mandates mask wearing say breathing problems come mask. employee sees someone without mask allowed say anything. Make require wearing nose. I'm Tennessee large percentage customers staff even wear right. Congrats weight loss! donation centers try? Don‚Äôt forget signs say ‚ÄúPlease respect social distancing stay 6 feet costumers cash register lanes.‚Äù 

And walk everyone dog lined dick ass every lane. Since employee lower management enforce, would best enforce immediate front door. corporate allows, hire single security guard front door help employees enforce it. security guard would eliminate confrontations /not all. prevent happening store, harder control. Prevent even entering store. 

The amount video showing mishap differences stores vs outside quite stark. 

STOP FRONT DOOR.

(yes would best didnt reality to) People don‚Äôt understand 

1. Exponential growth. human brain poor job this.

2. Deaths lag behind cases. think bad today.

3. Wont affect syndrome, brain poor job understanding mortality abstract

4. president ignorant willfully underplaying everything economic political reasons. 

5. media done poor apolitical, calls president out, supporters say see get him, fall back 1,2,3. Get torches pitchforks. Welp...looks like numbers 0 tomorrow. I'd surprised they'd even reported Good perspective. time though, 1000 people going die COVID today US alone. 700 people getting fever.... well long controlled. I'm putting money mouth way, tried best sign trials. mean even go in? excellent curbside pickup option phone app everything. Hope right... people need say O2 day 2 like UK PM can't get it... Covid become far deadly... new case day numbers staggering. Thats certainly \*possible\* although hard tell exactly person one thing, especially stressful situation (like chased cops).  sort well known problem general Baltimore though amongst people live there, lot older (1950s 60s) housing public private, lead paint. arent ton units left, course people still around exposed it. Thank you. I'm ok.. trying stay positive, thankful have. really appreciate kind comment  sarcasm literally drips like hot honey! police enforce might serve dual purpose giving mask objectors little greater insight BLM movement about. Becoming first school district southern United States go route face huge reopening push state wide nationally. name safety kids staff.

I'm part making happen I'm proud it.

SLP Proud Good thing fucking president posing beans. BURDEN PRIVATE BUSINESSES ENFORCE MANDATE. BURDEN PRIVATE BUSINESSES ENFORCE MANDATE. guess Bay Area high tech jobs allow wfh. LA jobs can't done remotely. Yeah agree. reason Britain hit hard, government fuck pure arrogance, realised fucked were, doubled changed things load politicians became ill Boris almost died. get 500 cases day. Problem US states opened regardless infection rates. stupid decision ruin economy even kill tens thousands. I'm honestly sad it, hundreds thousands dead across world lot deaths due government greed. 11:59:59 stuff here.

We putting condom sex. become orphans. wonder many Covid orphans there's going be. Going Peace Arch State/Provincial Park technically crossing border yet. long stay grass, got 20 acres [eight hectares] meet family, walk dog, ride bike, whatever want, return Canada. Legally. really entered United States"" believe tbh. virus really waking amount anti intellect people there, amount stupid people, stubborn people arrogant conspiracy theorists there....it's really splitting people area used pretty united things....despite sometimes voting different presidents stuff :/

now? free all. sucks ass Constantly clean every janitor infected üòì See! America great again! #1 baby! Breaking records regular!!! population - evidently ‚Äúthey‚Äù want us dead Wow sorry friend. Please tell family mask die. health status makes prime candidates death. Another good point mention wear mask, get sick, likely mild illness got less virus initially.  muthafuckin win!! People also going illegal raves, covid parties see catch first, etc. US huge place good luck enforcing well. see way American going get beside letting covid finish journey. hospital still swamped cases shut elective procedures months anticipation, causing massive loss revenue. make minimizing layoffs, everyone making 50k/year taking pay cut (among measures well). making taking highest percentage cut. highest administrators taking 20% cut. I'm sorry hospital sucks bad:( I'm excuse NJ 8s armpit...I would argue penis always spreads schmegma.   Ha, hilarious response. ""I think""‚Äîdo see irony? drown sound voice?

I hope throwing shallow accusation me‚Äîthe guy pointed salient point latched onto‚Äîhelps feel less inadequate exchange. Honestly surprised passed 5k deaths per day True. 

Well took 8 years President Reagan stop believing thing repeat. probably good opportunity kill others land,business cause annoyed cartel. guise lockdowns. get hopes up. Imo PR stunt, exemptions ridiculous. One say God said poof exempt. dangerous wear mask Monday? really simple math. U.S. 10% infected 423 deaths/million. need us multiple 10X 0.000423 get good estimate IFR is. leads 0.423%. Plus I'm generous percentage infected U.S. think IFR may higher though since older people careful lately younger people getting infected much higher rate late. Deaths may lag while. Cost living really low live. Rent $300 I'm making $2300 month. Got pretty decent savings. Nope. could also contaminating hands touching mask causing surface transfers handle things. vaccine caused make past phase 1 clinical trials politicians going beaches thing demonstrations?

The First Amendment. don‚Äôt want work, jobs available. Also, one time bought timber Midwest could, drive price.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, ""mail-in rebate"" scheme ""sales"" fucking bullshit marketing. Maybe not, remember field mouse fast, owl sees night... closed way late way little opened quickly.

They make mask mandate exceptions, two weeks.

We need nationwide mandate cases get 5k per day get nationwide 5% positivity rate. keep increasing cause soon everyone realizes returning work form best option‚Äî go back. gravy train ended. ... US. norm WalMart Mexico. Shake n bake! Leave mask car facing sun. also destroy virus That's took article. Cool. mean paranoid seeing probably got first cases transmitted U.S., imho can't afford another early wave rule-breaking makes feel better knowing park enforcement also looking us. keep list attendees deny future COVID healthcare? Well would hope, absence vaccine, urban cities kind burn gain immune resistance. Especially since really seems sweeping dense lower income areas. New York never experience second wave extent first one, Miami, Houston, Dallas etc...

I say Hope loosely still means lot death illness impacting denser populations, seems strategy US settled on. I‚Äôm also saying cities would absolute herd immunity, maybe maybe herd resistance Yikes, indeed!

At beginning pandemic r0 2.0. say better metric rT, effective reproduction number changes time varies place.  

Check website calculate 'til heart""s content, 'til heart breaks. Nope! Jersey weird grocery chains. moved Indiana NYC full blown cultural shock half year.

Visiting Midwest always trip. forget places existed ehh... pizza waaaay better here! went first site linked, hospitalisation trend looking scary... Yeah Jesus appears world peace.


People need stop crap. Half country wants happen. Yeah sound incredibly useful confirming virus really flimsy determining it. article even says confirm negative result standard test. Mandates sake public health important reckless people across political spectrum weather anti vaxxer type young people think big deal. Try resist, remember gimp Pulp Fiction, point gave accepted gimp. hold pipe hitters go medieval asses. lol msm purposely ignores No, that's No, capital N. point, can't read new case numbers without hearing 90s Eurobeat background.

How national US Emergency total lock 2 months everyone non essential employees established. blows mind. Well then, thank God almighty! ridiculous bullshit. could never happen.



Is something would thought years ago.  Yup. would never expect people understand vaccine trials work. pretty smart interest medicine can't tell difference phases. people even know vaccine works, basic level. media shit show sometimes. Brain damage, loss smell, amputations, heart failure, lung failure, organ failure, choking blood, etc. 

Oh, flu-like symptoms. üò© Serious question : Since protests didn‚Äôt seem clear spike, possible outdoor setting relatively safe?  took walk valley clearly neighborhood, interest masks waning. it‚Äôs OC (although may emblematic issue) Canada better start setting military style barricades across border crossings things REALLY get hand....

Things turn shit here, know people going Mexico... certainly stopped us before... know least one county Texas already decided school online only. could move county instead different country. *The highest death rate far Indiana Yes, say ""defund police"" poeple scream crime rates rise (incorrectly). Add ""fund community"" makes clear money going. tackle crime problem kids learn system. guess Canada smart people there. 

Why would anyone Canada want visit US ? want get close observation shit show going here? Sorry misleading post. work there. I'm shopper. Since story hit waiting hear results see effective masks would be. good news. even necessarily alternatives geographic sense, many people can't come budget without using Wal-Mart majority purchases 

I afford shop Wal-Mart, even still cheap incredibly appealing even still. would imagine less well basically feel like choice Wal-Mart debt.  Lol, think trade negotiation card talking long-term restrictions boarder number one trade partner.

Man, sub. worse terms death Chernobyl leaders trying downplay disaster innocents dying know what's going on. can‚Äôt believe ignorant they‚Äôre being, gambling children‚Äôs lives like know already...your country a(appropriately) strict immigration policy Governors need call national guard enforce mask policies. sub, especially. expect see least bit normalcy end 2020. Maybe DeSantis give medal. Louisiana Corona doesn‚Äôt pick choose, constitution does. governor literally doesn‚Äôt authority stop people protesting even wanted to. believe things deteriorate AZ, TX, FL undoubtedly undercounting deaths, *however*, dont think reasonable assume get bad April. lockdowns useless. bought time surely show road benefit hindsight saved fuck ton lives. still want job. I'm good laying down, guys. practice hours day. Give call, Mr. Soros. think lot anti-mask fools right actually want confronted get aggressive. even enacted announced it.

Side note: top occult things you‚Äôve sent you‚Äôve seen? I‚Äôm really interested. Goddamn plague rat live Florida would prefer not. Unfortunately people can't get heads asses I'm optimistic. Seriously point people still wear masks. Maybe stop maybe Elizabeth B√°thory ahead time. say thing every time, foolproof:

COVID testing widely available. Manslaughter? part trump administration would honestly great watch. Beanbag rounds rubber bullets would really teach lesson mean it‚Äôs like anyone forced playing like don‚Äôt know risks. think it‚Äôs worth risk don‚Äôt see people bothered agree it‚Äôs necessary moment.  least recycle headline upcoming months.

Hell, pay per view donate profits charity.üòÄüòÄ really isn‚Äôt bad. I‚Äôve tested twice. Takes seconds slightly uncomfortable that‚Äôs it. 2 weeks US deaths per million people France. projection shows Florida basically reached ICU bed capacity true? Funny, Rush Limbaugh went today children school teachers exempt getting Covid. Country needs leadership, government listens doctors scientists.

Fuck football!

PS love college football. ain't time it. going read dumpster fire political commentary below, know argument move is? Years ago, grandmother died took us three weeks get death certificate cause death. pandemic weird issues, simply Florida.  long three weeks mother really distraught entire time. 

So six weeks pandemic wouldn‚Äôt surprise all. us dont want way either. We're begging pleading governments everywhere please close things wont. absolutely refuse to. know people dying horrible agonizing deaths choosing let happen care ""the economy"" people PA, months now. Doug Douchey  ah yes assuming youre ""right"" everyone else agrees you, kind attitude served well last election hinting everyone opposing mask problem? doctors work bruises faces due masks (long hours) can‚Äôt people? don‚Äôt know genuine problem not, let‚Äôs say agree mental issues much challenging deal with. hard go store. many alternatives, delivery, asking friends grocery delivery charges problem, curbside pickup. mean people literally ready anything don‚Äôt come inside store without mask.

If know condition put danger everything make sure survive long family  Remember burned Nike shoes? Merkel: can't fight pandemic lies Hope Walmart riot division security  thought 14 days, no? SoCal haven‚Äôt seen heard protests going could wrong there. 

I agree COVID danger society. corrupt cops danger society too. Protesting brings change could save countless lives line. going beach provide? Who‚Äôs life saved going beach? going beach bring positive change society?

I don‚Äôt think anyone saying protests didn‚Äôt impact did. isn‚Äôt grounds open beaches gyms restaurants. 

Do think protests allowed happen? issue people downplaying effect case numbers? 1) diverted question ‚Äúthe mandate enforcing N95 masks‚Äù

2) source say ‚ÄúN95 masks reduce amount oxygen reaching lungs 20%‚Äù?!
-And regardless, mandate wear covering public, time!

- go again, loose wear mask? ...and welcome 140k club, sadly. say, unique form.

edit - President even well. brings question storing this. using saunas? hard supply chains stores catch infection rate keeps rising. farms factories get shut somebody's found positive. employees call sick sore throat cough would usually brush work through.

so things stores can't get hands right now. things stock shelves. people restocking can't keep they're mostly making bunch one-off trips back missing thing customer asked about. they're also stuck providing guidance lot people shopping behalf others familiar items they're looking for.

the people putting order together know stuff kept back, people know already spread thin -- shelf, ""probably stock"" unless make stink.

to add example, think local grocery store relish least month i'm surprised can't get sunflower seeds. granted, maybe curbside system broken underestimating situation inside store think people lazy incompetent. Wishing best. cdcs guidelines seemed little short me. Wasn‚Äôt sure think Friendly reminder hold cameras sideways filming. Free content can't wait see contradicts national strategy, adds it. source supports supposed contradiction?

In either case, looks like Swedes autonomous enough take good action local outbreaks, huge plus! wonder they've managed slow spread much despite late reaction. Sure virus related common cold, also get year. reasons already mentioned, plus also wider geographic spread cases. Initially high volumes concentrated NY WA. Lancet published study recently saying avg 17.8 days onset symptoms death. also take weeks record deaths. yes, unfortunately. hiring Mexicans fraction cost, perhaps even Persians even cheaper. Pay workers I‚Äôm no‚Äôer, shower say ""all same"", said China excellent controlling information levels built system explicitly applies *all* situations. 

They paired information control extremely harsh effective measures virus containment. succeed front still extremely restrictive information control. two completely separate things.

Trump generally failing fronts, since can't really restrict information effectively (and cat's long bag anyway), he's certainly trying. completely failed virus containment.  would wait least another week. way parents. Plus going spend nights germs intertwined anyways. enjoy visit make weird. pictured PLASTIC TUNNEL ET think right. yeah dont continue working them.  top comment 200,000 summer ends easily.

It'll take 220,000 US pass official death count UK. America treating race, it! Winter Coming! Fuck sake. worrying part see orangutan succeeding large portion society thinking covid control manipulates data wait! There‚Äôs more! Wow mean already? That's fucked, shop Target right now, seem actually pay attention make sure everyone enters wearing mask.

Walmart fucking terrible experience went everyone still wearing masks. Pro-control

ftfu sounds fun. Take easy friend I'm assuming win myself, people aren't. 160 pounds female seems obese 5‚Äô5‚Äù. Red Cross? Long term could save companies money generally companies signed onto long term office leases.

I however refuse serve someone without mask. done. customers HATE it. sometimes complain manager. say right refuse service ask wait another associate. managers want refuse service cuz hate pissing customers. can't anything it. 


Also manager asked proceed people without masks, said page manager deal it. want hourly employees dealing stuff like that. said. managers anything anyways, sooo... like we're back square one regard. need - Canada‚Äôs sneaky great long time. don‚Äôt tell bozos south border.

Yeah it‚Äôs really awful watch. think thing we‚Äôre missing country concept societal good. It‚Äôs something extremely hard get people buy into. fact, people often things might benefit benefit others more. I‚Äôve always envied countries strong sense public good built culture.

I think changing, least health care, universal health care gaining majority story better care number one priority lot voters across political spectrum right now. gone decades misery get point, it‚Äôs still going extremely hard pass despite majority support public. Like many reasonable policies ... 4 months ago? UK covid deaths 45,053

Hmmmmm..... basically he's half ass shutdown later date say ""See shutting work, might well open back up"". seem correct? change identity rest life? Ya wally world too. Im fine it. Largest U.S I‚Äôve never heard them.

I wish luck US man! definitely get paid enough crisis diffusers make shift security. poor people. think quit customer service job entitled Karens getting damn nerves cuss faces. üòÇ That's nothing compared poor people deal nowin seriousness. 

We need change rule. matter public safety personal preference point. customer belligerent threatening others allowed tell GTFO. course... That's gonna happen.  thread locked due number uncivil comments. 

Please keep conversation civil. Contradicted bit, perfectly good idea they're aware soldiers actually stick benefits. least really pushed hard using GI bill trade schools instead college. mouse demands human sacrifice!!! Oh, totally bad; mistook description someone tested positive COVID left hospital. 
I've gotta concentrate more; sorry, long weeks me. Yay feel good job even though numbers city still hundreds every day. live one lesser impacted neighborhoods feel safer days. Who‚Äôs handling food get home? see meaningless protecting keys aren‚Äôt protecting dozens things touching? Based old variety show called Gong Show. Classic ridiculousness.  remember shocked Italy 600 deaths. 

And seeing people celebrate US. 

Nothing makes sense anymore. realised Jons Hopkins thousands fewer US deaths Wordometer. different? cherry pick events nationwide 24 hour day pandemic every gov office, matter small large trying get correct information right people. Errors made, cares fatality rate, 135,000 Americans dead coming due Monday morning quarterbacks running around posting 10-15 errors 1,000,000 reports like they‚Äôve solved JFK. You‚Äôre disservice us. 

ICU‚Äôs nearly full mask mandate, lockdown like NYC did, think gonna get better think 5-6 reports bogus? Fatality rate doesn‚Äôt matter thousands dying, outside us absolutely nowhere near herd immunity. 

So good luck whataboutisms, people like reason nobody trying save lives, you‚Äôve tried illustrate mass conspiracy one doesn‚Äôt exist. conspiracy going right one inaction.  Good luck get everyone onboard... Trump promised take action China. Easy say.

But he's different. Hiding data pretending nothing happens. Try focusing breathing breath nose slowly bit take second reading that. might breathing shallow taking oxygen efficiently. I""m really happy this, can't see anywhere able enforce it. stores Arizona signs saying people need wear masks &amp; still least 10% customers wearing them, wearing nose, etc. I've also seen employees wearing nose. tried police myself, would take day. many people refuse wear masks wrangle. also see many fights going posted social media. hope stores ban people bringing firearms going get really screwed up. know really unlikely, checking temps would even more, opinion. much good telework order actually though, companies going go back teleworking already? target less half employees wear masks.

Possibly Asian  Unrelated it‚Äôs sad add ‚Äúalong first responders‚Äù sound like shitty politician (not it‚Äôs internet culture) Call delusional. 

Your comments aged well. surprised... next question is, penalize employees wearing masks incorrectly? see several employees literally every time go store. disproportionately affected gays, blacks, drug users government would pushing instead merely ignoring it. wish HIV/AIDS. want half gets donation. hope $0. Took long enough. expect much [this new Suicides. Oof. per capita? think Florida could end *excess deaths* per capita UK? Ok man. 

Attention smart people: Utah area President came said wear mask two weeks Elder Bednar told us wary government taking freedoms away. Draw conclusions. brother like this. brother friend I'd done him. blood need put lunacy see him. That's am--family Ohio, follow what's going on. also grew reading stuff hometown Facebook pages enough tell none people wear mask unless they're made to. They've bought every stupid conspiracy theory hoax idea that's dig heels end wearing one.  Every day I'm dismayed things read there. Easy, blame protests... think it‚Äôs vapes China Ny?

Do reaction racism people color? Kroger days ago, governor mandated masks public county.  
I checking guy walked without mask. employee told mask. man polite, left store.
The Kroger employee taking guff, stern professional. told man wear mask order governor.  
And course county sheriff says deputies enforcing mask requirement, contact Health Department, office, mask compliance complaints.   
I expect sheriff's deputies stationed outside supermarkets writing tickets, chief law enforcement officer county could grow pair fucking balls least tell people wear goddamned mask; sheriff could demonstrate solidarity employees establishments will, ultimately, bear responsibility, repercussions, enforcing governor's orders.    
Ridiculous? egregious abdication responsibility? affront public safety? 
What *are* words stupidly U.S. responding crisis? ""I'm one whose sick""

No fucking shit! sick head, take mask acne getting broke lawyer entitled beyond belief ignorant milktose ass back Karen Factory reason Covid went away places everything shut down. store open neighborhood. see stores open people mass transit. matter time Covid resurfaces. thing shut Covid total world shutdown 3 weeks.

Socialization important aspect schooling. think going remote must duration pandemic, effects decision going felt. Hard call em sheep though since we're legally required :| yeah.... Kroger Cincinnati mask policy booth store security it. also cop generally security. It‚Äôs best Kroger. 416,800 American servicemen died WW2 1939-1945. averages 69,467 deaths year. 137,000 covid related deaths like 4 months? Looks worse me.

Edit: since it‚Äôs actually 7 years, it‚Äôs 59,543 deaths per year. People pretty much started wearing masks am, heart ""i ain't wearin mask"". better feel do, since I'm Utah. guess really big issue. said 150 people, easy get many wackos decent sized town. right, think unnecessary free makes feel better. want arm length rubber gloves gas mask power you. Starting July 22nd. Right headline. ones i've found say protect people, mainly preventing spread *by* selfish people thru ignorant pieholes.

can provide couple links studies found say otherwise..? Right. vote person opposing guy actively causing death hundreds thousands Americans rather face even tiniest shred accountability moron. might last numbers ever get White House strong arming hospitals report CDC anymore. People aren‚Äôt ones dying. Guess what? Case numbers also heading many European countries. Austria, Spain, Serbia, even Germany bit. Japan spiking cases too....the problem is, matter country opens, cases go up. Deaths also ticking many places. Let's hope trend continue.  #PANTIESFORFAUCI  signed new Walmart-Big Ten Mask Melee TV Package. $8.99 month. Seems pretty reasonable action I'll get see. I'm still waiting see much UFC-Home Depot Covid Chaos package is. sounds like they're going actual Octogon entrance every store. pretty sweet. *Time travel intensifies back day DJT election* Why? right people older, may may underlying health conditions probably concerned about....from spent years eating using drugs etc....you never know messed arteries really BOOM say ""I'm holding it"" try take card. They're smarter Orange county CA Sad Walmart one leaders trying stop spread COVID. could said governments (state federal).

As side note... can't wait see videos meltdowns people can't get giant jars cheese puffs dr. pepper Nice deflection. Let‚Äôs try again. 

You‚Äôre racist generalizing white people. defense agreeing you‚Äôre racist?  room long?! probably satire still can‚Äôt believe charred corn-on-the-cob-for-brains like managed waste time energy typing idiotic comment even mean? Fuck yourself, coward

(See 28th bb. Happy hockey back) worries hurt election chances, make criminally exposed crimes he‚Äôs indicted yet. I'll believe actually happens. two Kroger company chains near - QFC Fred Meyer - far neither even questioned people shopping without mask (that seen, many people store aren't) even though state supposedly requires it. Trader Joe's even enforcing it, person says, ""medical condition"" Trader's lets instead get someone else shop curbside whatever. lost lot respect Trader's chain due expect QFC Freddie's. Nice I'm wrong I'm gonna count it. cannot make shit up. I'm grocery manager Kroger KMA, Fred Meyer. publicity stunt. already signs posted state's mandate stop people. inform offer masks door. asked try enforce people say medical can't anything. Basically thing we're already doing.

Even give us hours allow one associates mask enforcer sorts, it. managers time increase sales enforce it. store still seeing 30% sales increase week week focused maintaining business anything else. 

If someone complains another customer, course go investigate. However, employees/managers like want deal confrontation won't. tell this. bagger 7 months Kroger 15. 15 year olds deal dumbass customers. selfish dumb turd. cannot believe ridiculous humans now. Fucking hell. 

Hope spills scolding hot coffee herself. can't think PD lets officers moonlight uniform without official channels. Nobody cares CEO Customer Relationship Management Software company thinks country run either. 

Progressive activists pretending journalists like amplify opinions marquee names people share opinions  thought Kroger employees union? Good luck workers stores. Michigan we‚Äôve required since Monday (I always anyways) wear masks inside buildings I‚Äôve already seen people getting upset mad. needs happen though. dare offend orangutans like that? pretty smart, lot say president. I'm looking pictures [USA seated massive distancing masks, walking around maybe 50% masks. Seems bad.


For America. That‚Äôs terribly sad. wonder previous experience meningitis bearing way system responded infection. Wait people won‚Äôt wearing them? Yes! Let's make subscription based proceeds going people work struggling small businesses. we‚Äôre disappointed cancellation Renaissance Festivals, we‚Äôll get see daily jousting sessions all.

Sweden years ahead cities mention article. could call cops health inspectors every restaurant fail health inspection that??? guys minds. Please watchful careful. yesterday first time since March. weird. Insane already. thought Walmart said contagious starting 7/20... Kroger says 7/22. contagious today? cashier couple months ago old lady came coughed like everything front area, mask covering mouth much hand. coughing almost nonstop twenty minutes. It‚Äôs weird see Republican governors look alike? üòñ store evening there‚Äôs one guy entire store without mask. county mandated masks one guy walking around store high mighty without mask. 

Next time, I‚Äôll happy confront employees don‚Äôt to. 

Time bring shame people publicly.

‚ÄúAttention Smith‚Äôs shoppers, I‚Äôd like bring attention one fucking asshole store without mask‚Äù produce section. Publicly shame them, embarrass publicly, maybe they‚Äôll wear mask avoid attention next time. Maybe not... one friend describe like everyone outside watching experiment. art bouncing like jedi-zen. musician clubs best bouncers seen one's materialize need say word. also probably nicest people place. I'll grant absolute idiots IMO. also think flat ""look stupid"" little inbred.

However, fully expect Utah state duck calamity going hit similar ideological states (TX, AZ, ID). significant LDS population follows church mandates well, church recently mandated members Utah use masks. 

Really wish place could people like mindset get together could let live happily without requiring use masks. Already planning camp local Walmart first day goes effect. Gotta stock popcorn!

Same, live Maine. NZ 22 deaths pop 4.5 million equiv 1760 pop 360 million - USA per day soon, esp schools open - that's rational CARING govt achieves - now, know over, .... Wait Ben Jerry's stores? üëÄüëÄüëÄ weird thing live right downtown mask wearing prob 25%- 50% outdoors required stores buses people wearing least indoors. douches hard majority working home CERB. 

Its honestly starting feel bit back normal. See lot people walks lot distancing going on, lot people biking mask promising vaccines prob year away. three phases opening smart imo governments handled well.

I feel bad countries stubborn see mask, hand washing, social distancing parties months get back full normal. Walmart near already mandatory thankfully. booming looting, rioting cutting back police anything. Unfortunately, yes... seems majority Americans really stupid.
The USA fuckd worse dying COVID? Lame, try harder non union state? wonder thst makes difference. One untenured well year. click link understand Local control thee. Meanwhile:

- Federal mask mandate

- coordinated federal response

- CDC shut coronavirus data

- Top US infectious disease official ignored, mocked, shut down

- State governments purposefully interfering local mask orders

- President lending credence conspiracy theories, urges testing reduced

- state federal efforts increase availability PPE citizens

- Citizens told _not_ obtain utilize effective PPE

- Purposefully rushed re-openings, refusal follow CDC guidelines

- Federal demand re-open schools height first wave -- massive transmission vector

One conclude USA has, highest levels, decided rapid uncontrolled spread SARS2 _desired_. 

The question remains is: population allow continue economy collapses due non-response purposeful campaign profit spread? Damn feels good live Canada. I'll purchasing bunch shit open consumers. I'm expecting second wave/uptick cases masks like would make feel much safer finally returning work coming weeks. July 16th? Get him! Less people world happier everyone be! username like that, I‚Äôll consider it. Based every hard hit area populations take seriously amazingly issues now. Hoping NJ follows suit telework. I‚Äôm glad haven‚Äôt opened indoor dining, even things tough restaurants Preach. feel like taking crazy pills! shit isn‚Äôt fucking political. stop caring others LIVES? Wearing mask smart hard. Yet people fighting about. CMON PEEPS. UNITED STATES AMERICA. DIVIDED states America. FACKKK!! Meh. stores require mask anyway. you‚Äôre getting closer. Explains people complaining ""not enough testing"" and/or results taking long. Labs working fast possible resources hand.

 company work received emergency license DOD guidelines produce new rapid COVID-19 test. Getting accurate, rapid test research, QA, validation production takes time. Ramping production takes even time investment.

Its quite stunning quick response honest. easy forget them.

Anyway, cool kids club. least 0.1% population needs die.

e: indiana Ooh, like that.

*tucks pocket later* seem like told think It‚Äôs starting tick well, south you. wear mask regularly affect ability breathe. 30 min one time golfing literally thought going feint die driving home. Scary shit. Locking individual states pointless unless travel state also restricted. Kroger based Cincinnati Ohio, used big south decades ago. know Harris Teeter owned Kroger, I'm sure chains too. Kroger's gonna hire bouncer. United States' largest supermarket revenue ($121.16 billion fiscal year 2019), second-largest general retailer (behind Walmart). thinking, better start making karenfederate flag Somewhere distance, Karens everywhere prepared go war. hope you‚Äôre right won‚Äôt hold breath race. No, giving excuse. first like cold hold water, next excuse. get it, made political.

I think give people credit deserve, that's can't get head wrapped around this. matter political, rationalizations plain ignorance there, brain can't let go accept way things are. Maybe Covid19 bringing already there.

The school year start people keep getting unemployment checks, Let's hear next set excuses two-three months, change ""prospective"" again. schools causing financial woes though. virus government's shitty response is. Direct anger appropriately. Trust me, kids' teachers like better you. love teach. miss students. haaaaaaate teaching online. want back room badly, signed became teacher. you‚Äôre Canadian choose go willingly USA, you‚Äôre dumber fuckin Cory Trevor Yeah, fatalism never helps anything. Can‚Äôt believe trolls aren‚Äôt already defending this. Except 3 parents kids want school. 117 voted person. kids take years get back skills before. get none understand regression many kids school year round it. pretty wild that, list long, Kroger least-dumb name.

GERBES death rate declined significantly since hit NY NJ, largely elder care facilities taken much greater precautions prevent disease entering facilities.

If talking short term, deaths lag cases, death counts arent really comparable day day death certificates signed weekends, best thing look 7-day averages. trending upward since start month, thankfully still nowhere near peak April. There‚Äôs still time feel fine. another two weeks right? another two weeks. another...  Even days knowing accurate death case count likely gone Fed cuts CDC data collection control reporting. transparent even worse seeing current numbers. Might need reread article. guy sitting rascal door super tall veteran hat checks every 5th receipt enforce it.  So? I‚Äôm even convinced that. He‚Äôs much happier opposition.  logic laws all?

Most murders property crimes go unsolved? 

Let‚Äôs issue strong warnings rather laws place they‚Äôre hard enforce. 

I understand sentiment feel you‚Äôre letting leadership much easy case. I‚Äôll bounce bouncy play gym boiiii think too..then go grocery store gas station realize maybe majority Americans stupid.  entitled opinion. What!!!???? guy fucking sack shit. hell wrong people!?  absolutely not, local Wal-Mart buying oil, total free all, 0 control masks, people pulling resting chin. noped fuck there. admit you‚Äôre racist? 
What‚Äôs wrong making fun black people? Asians? Latinos? Chernobyl. people saying trump considering executive order limits number cases allowed one day state. Well walmart actually loss prevention/security department that's basically thing  Well that's huge if!  hold towel front someone throws bucket water towel block water getting through, don‚Äôt even need video know that‚Äôs true. 6 face masks = 6 x 5G infection levels delivered government. 30G way people planet now, therefore conclude people believe flat earth medieval times. ""Winfluenza"" Ok I‚Äôm guessing may people popping Xanax like pez then. Ya argument hold well happened wide variety countries varying policies adherence public.

Of course politicians people hard hit areas claiming credit amazing decision making led stop spread, likely herd immunity closing in.

Italy, UK, Spain, NY, NJ, Sweden, etc.

On flip side, places strict masks, distancing, etc since beginning unable contain spread (e.g. California).

You literally go worldometers, sort deaths per million, every country/state deaths per million best now, every country/state least struggling failing contain spread now. expect Walmart pay $30 hr? Try like $11-$12 hr  wear mask regularly long feel like passing out. thanks, ill wear 1 mask. Breathing recycled air long hardly seems good you. Excuse story posted month earlier. Moral story still same, rinsed recycle news stories push narrative. Even idea disease attacking defenses scared shit people Yes, everything said. don‚Äôt get NYers don‚Äôt understand Even federal law, can't send FBI agents every Walmart, 13 thousand FBI agents, jobs do. 500 thousand cops.

The way logistically enforce law via local cops. Might well ever donated before? voter suppression gets us. see point like Costco 100 miles away. get every teacher dreading going back work? Trumpo's heading record 1000 deny - best ever ..... AMAZING No. not.

The country needs sons daughters alive, putrid fuck muscle. Dead wrong point one. Benioff could drunk dial elected official ever voted 3AM tonight would calling back morning. wealth makes idle opinions exponentially important yours. 

Your second comment said tilted perspective seems suggest sort debatable topic. opinion article novel anybody ever breathed nose. Sites thrive clicks chum obvious get clicks, go figure. Actually probably allowed contest customers. company said masks required customers, confront customer wearing one. safety, instances safety put risk confronting customers choice wearing mask... soooooo yeah. probably door person, one inside allowed say anything people take mask inside store. get stupider every day.  That's funny, we're basically fully open people acting like virus completely gone. Wow, right? actual fuck? considered taking leave quarantined senior citizen mother wanna risk it, needed money kept working took extra precaution. I'm kinda glad leave. That's fucking horrid. Stop patting backs, fucktards. done **MONTHS AGO**. I‚Äôm late party worldwide states? vaccine developed, widely available two different questions. could six months away getting vaccine. produce literally Billions inoculations could take years. need inoculate 60-70% population vaccine effective stop spread.

And then, countries going compete it, states provinces, gets vaccinated first? elderly? Children? Medical professionals? rich? First come first serve? Maybe random draw social security number (like fim Contagion). mandatory? Rest world blocked us. policy whole time???!! I'm suburb outside Columbus people wearing thankfully Good.

The 'Not Fucking You' clause.

This deal Americans respect laws. We're close. something like 800+ reported deaths today. Good mind kroger largest grocery chain america, often market different brands. said escape it, confront head on. do.you think is? Mul-ti-pass Shits required Texas Kroger‚Äôs since July 1st, they‚Äôll kick ass store till come back one, far Karen‚Äôs sight, HEB btw made curious Got good books examining requirements governments overthrown using examples history evidence? live far downtown HB. Went drive pch fourth...beach looked like business usual even tho ""closed"" could count one hand masks saw.

Went go pick food earlier today Costa Mesa masks damn thing...I'm really starting hate country, whole industry basically crippled point, job go back anymore, thanks fucking idiots claim whole thing hoax. America deserves fate major civilians....and fall seems inevitable now. rate, people go routinely would likely infected fall already, probably 40-45%% hotspot states, highly likely get quite bit better right now. Though fall/winter virus peaks see mutates stronger form like second wave Spanish flu did. Hopefully not. No, response northern europe wearing masks major outbreaks there. gave 2 examples (which happen represent majority northern European population) disproving claim. really obtuse?  Please place ~~bets~~ predictions appear r/byebyejob.

I'm gonna say 2 days name leaked press, unless he's self employed.  I've never even seen Kroger. fuck. think states it. test enough 10% control group infected couple weeks virus would R0 high whole world could infected 3 times now.

Brazil 1% confirmed infected total. thinking same. ACA helps prevent profit bloat insurers. great safeguard right now. Please go kick shit Karens part time. Yeah ""peak"" problem states actually something it. freaking talking opening schools. 2-3 weeks we'll still curving up. guy looks like fits LEAST two categories. way waiting half year approval knowing results. fucking way. vaccine works know getting released. 2022 Oh think absolutely happy accident! I'm going start saying purpose. Narrator: *If experiencing irrational stupidity 5 days consult local politician. Side effects may include: listening. caring. even there. MORE!*

Absolute class right there, cheers dude üôÇ Sorry shameful lack intellect. Life protip: entire state Oregon gov workforce went permanent wfh job suitable it. immediately. Everyone knows wtf going on. mask. food. Simple. Becos voted place there. technically voters selected them. Democracy say people usher Authoritarianism. Lol theyve wishy washy believe current stance hospitalization disqualifies you. fuck factory works... hire another 100,000 current ones die.... s/ drive? hard US fuck airlines   feel wearing mask reckless dangerous drunk driving?

You‚Äôd ok jail time, heavy fines, probation wearing mask? swear place I've felt safe sprouts

so interesting. sprouts laxest places visited.  canidate? One thing frustrates talk ""saving economy"", seems lack understanding losing 1% population actually means economy GDP.

Letting virus soar might look better short term (economically speaking), long run, people died never produce anything again, point curve meets, start seeing losses compared locked country stifled epidemic

[Here's amateur course, that's understanding whole ordeal.

There's also another aspect it, graph account for. COVID kills primarily 60 - 70 age group, far statistics. That's young intern middle aged asshole manager, that's senior engineer, CEO, guy shop knows stuff, experience younger people learn from. view, let COVID ravage society lockdown save businesses, gonna destabilize lot businesses either way.

And purely economic standpoint. There's human aspect well. think lot people losing faith government moment, people around them. lot people feeling sacrificed, like loved ones sacrificed. lot people hurt, losing loved ones. pain go away along virus. consequences. know form kind consequences, there. take long? Honestly pictures looks like he's since March lol. man looks *bad* old people die. Maybe doesn‚Äôt want job anymore. Yea frustrating part this. completely within control. So, everyone trying best fight thing punished everyone else potentially years nonsense. think left Maryland live Florida. Frying pan fire much? Cdc delayed weeks compared reporting state logic I‚Äôm responsible current regime couldn‚Äôt sway millions people vote perspective?

I say modicum responsibility, yes, roughly equal total amount responsibility divided amount able citizens country.

And get wrong, come utterly shit country take modicum responsibility it. never voted presidents (I voted every ellection, two party system), ever, I'm still citizen, still vote, still fund taxes.

With freedom democracy comes responsibility, matter Seems like completely outrageous unreasonable opinion have, opinion, appreciate fact ‚Äúown it‚Äù.

Well, tough appreciate republic works. president *your* president, president constituency. lawful acts taken name funded money. responsibility that, whether chose not.

That's society works. choose civil responsibilities. choose subject law. choose represented. are. realm life works like that. Life plagued responsibilities Technically Putin isn‚Äôt dictator. He‚Äôs ‚Äúelected‚Äù leader.

Ethics care technicalities. Trump elected democratic system society supported legitimized generations ample opportunity change. Donald Trump rightful, legitimate lawful representative. windmill cancer. Illuminati gave chemtrails 911 planes. Wow tried 3 different ways civil discussion disaster psychology bot keeps removing posts. I'm sorry think point conversation really valuable. :-/  You‚Äôre even sure live. Quit advocating spread deadly virus. You‚Äôre selfish bastard. Came talk shit supermarket chain, remembered moronic president country still claims great, guess Kroger fine.  Meh keep real I‚Äôm immunologist either wanna /s rona-zona flo-rona hire big scary mask enforcer dudes. Hells angels something. Lol thanks. seriously expect get attacked voted right hell post. Pretty certain it‚Äôs $850 month probably $12,600 deductible NY fact population entire countries love give idiots week stock buy huge amounts banned American Academy Pediatrics ""Fake news""? CDC? also said kids face coverings worn children age 2 anyone trouble breathing, unconscious, incapacitated, otherwise unable remove mask without assistance.

Maybe admit wrong move on. look like moron point even know Republicans lived Maryland lol got tested covid today friend 4th weekend tested positive. symptoms, basically got tested sure I‚Äôm okay. paperwork gave states I‚Äôm negative come isolation I‚Äôm positive come 1. fever 72 hours 2. Symptoms improved 3. 7 days passed since symptoms appeared. Soooo I‚Äôm positive don‚Äôt show symptoms, technically allowed come back out? insight? Obvi hoping I‚Äôm negative trying figure out. don‚Äôt take chill pill look mirror stop defending people want hurt people. Unrelated thought Wal-Mart biggest supermarket States. Brit never heard Kroger.  sad I'm sure joke current reality I'm aware of. someone enjoyed conflict worked retail - especially knew right point could literally kick someone - would love mask bouncer. Yeah, forget $20 drug, need get ""*The One Totally Works*"" (Redemisivir) costs cool $3000 per patient! Nothing going all... live Chicago rarely see people neighborhood wear them. wait?

Does include Kroger owned stores?  work them?

* NY - 1,669 per 1m dead
* NJ - 1,768 per 1m dead
* - 1,214 per 1m dead
* CN - 1,227 per 1m dead
* RI - 932 per 1m dead
* PA - 572 per 1m dead

I'd argue NY surrounding states failed rather epic levels.

States like looking different results

* CA - 186 per 1m dead
* FL - 210 per 1m dead
* TX - 124 per 1m dead I'm planet xzanthar.. maybe op too? fuckin' dumb shit, shure fun downvote!  itt: ""the molecule O2 smaller virus made millions atoms."" Someone go houses smash windows. Make jobs glaziers.  Florida hit busy storm season could miss several days several weeks school. remember missing two weeks classes around fourth fifth grade. sophomore year college delayed days due storm well. new gym rat mantra?

""LIFT Fast, Die Young (from Covid) Leave Beautiful Corpse!"" Yes. Desantis idiot. cherry picked two failing countries try pretend Northern Europe poorly, aren‚Äôt.

Sigh. housemate 2 years old. He‚Äôs kid. ^(what consider ""mainstream media""? foxnews part center left leaning stations?) meant extreme opinions wearing masks ok, thanks exactly CDC longer control reporting hospitals clinics report directly Whitehouse. serious gaming system going here, needs stop.

That comes across administration wanting directly control numbers instead CDC guess that's matter whether trust CDC administration more. Trump underlings never gamed anything though, guess that's trust case.  see. much test? US tested per capita country, locked fairly normally western standards, aren‚Äôt great either. I'm sure federal government write laws like that, real enforcement. could encourage put pressure states enact laws, bare minimum encouraging people wear them. Also southern Indiana, confirm. most, 1 5 wearing masks currently kroger comment implying whole ""you know isnt wearing masks""

Half hood isnt wearing masks...so *you* tryin blame also check r/MaskSkepticism I've thinking 8-10 days too. many recovered SARS 1 people today? think would surprised know many shoppers Walmart Karens... Math checks out. Oh god... paid $100 $1500/year deductible plan years ago; switched VA primary care provider. federal employee time too.

But $12k? Come on. That‚Äôs fucking robbery. bad inside, go int parking lot, can't see anything wiht glasses lesson Japan taught us diversity mistake. Oh bad. cake tonight. Start people refuse trespassed property banned permanently Yeah thing is, many different sites (JHU, BNO, etc.) report numbers every single day. sites also count ""probable cases"" states release (not 100% confirmed considered ""probable"") well things like testing positive antibodies. though. Generally, numbers tend far other, yeah, Worldometer says 70K+ right BNO currently says 55K, though BNO input data bunch states yet. Nah dude hear? EVIDENCE DATA showing that's possible. Must mistake. Kids spread thing all. even slightest bit. Umm.. passed 100K weeks ago think mean brown shirts. Texas here. mask mandate joke bunch loopholes(you say medical condition say you‚Äôre praying sort worship get away it) it‚Äôs even really enforced. Governor Abbott plans shutting state even though death count keeps growing. confronted blames everybody They're hiring new role employees, ""Health Ambassadors,"" wearing black polo shirts ""helping customers find solution"" want wear mask. said certain health conditions exempt (who knows means?) they'll offering free masks. right stores, associates allowed enforce anything usually call police something goes wrong, know new employees given freedom act customers violation rules. Good thing you‚Äôre already ocean. Well mouse... say one thing that's slower right thing capitalism republican leadership? Yep every day setting new case records. differ Johns Hopkins, CDC, individual state DOH data? Little late party Walmart almost different drugs different effects! obviously quackery pure price gouging buy mdma, that's enjoy coke! always spot asshole regard customer service positions.  Governors need start calling National Guard enforce it. yeah, get one tight fit nose I'm terrified exhausted. passed news crew front entrance WDW way work morning.

If whole state looks moving wrong direction 88 counties trending up, would make sense statewide mandate. think today ""you better get crap together "" address.

Moving color coded counties nice touch provide interesting granular data. everybody knows, virus respect borders. Florida, Miami Dade county. Yet people make comparisons Florida/miami cases countries it‚Äôs eaten everyone shits FL. That's right. fight micro level. literally neighborhood neighborhood. parts Latin America referring to?

Best luck too.  Bold statement coming fat pig absolute insanity sense people dangerous sociopaths. USAssholes self absorbed, small minded, hard hearted can't troubled something good country. Many paranoids believe pandemic real, hoax. makes even crazier told do. insane. Again, advice giving specific live, clock starts day took test, day get results back (because, sick day took test, know it). Really? additional training hiring? That's disappointing hear true. Texas lieutenant governor told us old people willing die economy. Funny mask craze, absolutely zero education masks actually work. say local Kroger, requiring it, heavily suggested patrons entering store. Lol PLEASE show got bit information from. retailers transitioning away conventional stores.  Curbside pickup going anywhere. mean CDC involved? agree. time see real numbers instead inflated ""everyone dies virus COVID death"" ""suspected cases"" tallied in. Floyd tested positive COVID, guess COVID death, cops liable. Right? mean that's we're this, we?

I want see **confirmed deaths proper COVID complications** **confirmed cases, tested once** (given 50% false positive rate).

Real data, pseudoscience faulty controls. I‚Äôm going try shop places people required wear masks. would go business puts opinions assholes health? I‚Äôve shopping almost exclusively Costco main grocery runs pandemic, good see new options. Twist, /r/zwebzztoss realizes late may Karens making statement. 

I like calling people Karen. makes sad cause know people named Karen nice people. 

But fuck Karen. concern data showing loss antibodies COVID fairly short period time. case, possibility re-contracting disease reality. fear gridlocked hell hole vaccine found mass produced Miami LA?  Typically categorized percentage sales come food. see happens fall winter year, however chance covid19 reaching level close 0. Spanish flu quite deadly 20-30s age group people dies age healthy people, that's spanish flu severe pandemic modern times.

As covid closer severity 1968 flu pandemic. Even mutates becomes severe, close impossible reach threat spanish flu's second wave. least age group 45, death rate still remain low mutating. Also people highly unlikely live even 70 years old spanish flu pandemic, honestly covid happened 1918, countries even notice ever people 70 severe cardiovascular disease able long close non existent, die quickly time.

It could get severe, Dr fauci also note close impossible reach spanish flu's second wave severity. took what, 150k deaths companies adopt policies? market works fast! I'm picturing reality show, like Parking Wars meets 600-lb Life.  Yeah, something that's said enough out-of-state travelers really fucking states actually trying control situation. really needed national leadership disaster got Trump Trump instead. I've seen seen kroger employees wearing mask yet. dont see actually happening. 

It should, won't. Fresh Market owned Kroger.

Just making general point everyone here, particularly pointed you. Merriam-Webster: 

'Definition social distance

1 : degree acceptance rejection social interaction individuals especially belonging different social groups (such based race, ethnicity, class, gender) large body sociological research showing lessening social distance among groups typically decreases prejudice improves ability understand concerns ""other.""‚Äî Jean Reith Schroedel 

The purpose study evaluate whether elective psychiatric course outcomes designed target stigmatization dispel myths could reduce student social distance toward patients severe mental illness.'

I see anything could measure ruler historical definition 'social distancing'. Physical distance defined ISO unit metre easy measure. would take Bush Trump everyday week, twice Sunday. America long history bullying people submission, using abilities own, discarding like crumpled husks. capitalist society, everything price. Everything. wait till 2021 still close over. Judging read can‚Äôt imagine sober writing Actually people dying less. That's push case numbers, death numbers less impressive wrong. There's absolutely nothing stopping states making rules this. Plenty too. Well....when Wal Mart enforces policy EMPLOYEES, I'll consider it. See 90% employees wearing wrong. Grocery stores actual bouncers thing, especially weekend nights Time. I, uh...forgot rest. Sorry. Bouta steal 2,3/4 target shells forever-unoccupied outdoors section. can't flip switch magically people trained deal this. That‚Äôs be. Let‚Äôs give federal government power dictate lives. Leave states, businesses, people. apply Harris Teeter, too? Cuz sure said wouldn‚Äôt enforce mask rules. sure started shopping elsewhere.

Note: Kroger owns Harris Teeter. Totally agree shouldn‚Äôt yell genuine cases. also realize anyone genuine case understands seriousness situation go way avoid situation. Specially stores curbside pickup.

The definition Merriam Webster social distancing is:

This course different definition ""social distance"" already quoted. Yes lets bunch untrained workers dealing this.  sounds like great idea. reading I've done, I've got pinned early 2021 widespread availability.

I stated look confirmed cases, realize right America single worst country planet this.

You tried cherry pick two countries (the ones absolute worst pandemic responses Northern Europe) try prove aren‚Äôt wearing masks despite bad breakout.

Fact remains Northern Europe MUCH better America, therefore don‚Äôt absolutely NEED wear masks.

You picked two outliers meaningless this. picked two specific countries attempt prove general point. 

Most Northern Europe done FAR better US (despite two cherry picked countries), therefore don‚Äôt nearly need take measures US. means little defensive ‚Äúwe better despite stupid‚Äù....falls apart.

Stop comparing totally differing situations. It‚Äôs called ‚Äúapples oranges‚Äù. Try comparing America country similar outbreak (oh wow Brazil doesn‚Äôt wear masks shitty whereas Northern Europe isn‚Äôt wearing masks FAR better US).

I can‚Äôt explain simply. You‚Äôre comparing region world already mostly beat virus country utterly failed response. You‚Äôre using specific outlier examples try prove trend simply isn‚Äôt true general region Northern Europe.

OF COURSE don‚Äôt wear masks. There‚Äôs far less need. aren‚Äôt getting 60k infections day.

Compare same.

My god. Talk someone obtuse. like Costa Rica, parts Mexico far away American border/tourist areas Peru. safest country favourite Cuba.

The catch feel resistance taking breath, try take deeper breath. highlights makes feeling resistance worse.

So issue feel resistance, makes take deeper breaths, causes resistance. 

This trigger anxiety, also results deeper breaths- results resistance anxiety.

Practice mask taking long, steady slow breaths instead short, rapid ones.

No point arguing anymore. simply aren‚Äôt going agree *Indoor* relaxation zones. TLDR: deaths lag weeks, age infected affects death rate orangutan recently ordered hospitals bypass CDC may start manipulating numbers

Well one cases falling awhile till around June 10th roughly. Since slowly started rise 7 day moving average cases went 40k+ around 29th June. Covid deaths lag saw Iran deaths started rise around month cases rising. Patients die within days usually takes weeks. Since last week however deaths slowly started rise again. July 4th 7 day moving average deaths 519. 14th July 743 day. increas deaths seeing 2-4 weeks ago. deaths infected last week know till either end month early next month. expect deaths increase next month I'd say. patients die within days take weeks die recover. we've already seen hospitals Florida running ICU beds

Secondly also depends age infected. younger people getting infected death toll bad since generally younger people likely survive. age also factor. 

And lastly assuming orangutan start manipulating figures since ordered hospitals bypass CDC send figures white house. quite frankly trust him. reason CDC needs bypassed. 20yr old self feels attacked this. Even embarrassing took mid July anything it. Another Florida man Umm, unless 100 percent California infected, call bs. Canada population 36.7ish million, California's population 40ish million... loser, wonder control there.  anyone ELI5 Phase 2 trials Phase 3 trials can't done time alongside other? 

Honestly really understand point phase 2. phase 3 smaller? solution: one make wear mask. Businesses, require masks shielded liability related virus. Otherwise explicitly liable. Voila. part florida in? I'm Naples like nothing ever happened here. fucking little fucking late would imagine something levels government incredibly apathetic regards supporting businesses enforcing rules like backlash policy caused areas.  think companies finally enacting policies longer choice going try dealing alone.

Yeah, let's see goes Tennessee.

Stupid fucks everywhere. ‚ÄúIndoor rides? indoor rides? central air conditioning? hand sanitizer signs stuff!‚Äù Supermarkets allowed people without masks whole time? Shit, wonder we're still knee deep shit. required wear masks around area months. idea.  Walmart 10 years. effective immediately? wait next Wednesday enforce already enforced months ago? It‚Äôs ridiculous assertion. preserving many tests could time.

Basically flu could explain symptoms, assumed covid negative.

But nothing stops infecting time. husband works grocery store... one... employee stays door make sure everyone coming wears mask assholes anti mask take put pocket wear around neck view employee. husband regular managerial duties also act like babysitter ask people please put masks majority become aggressive asked. also ‚Äúnitpick‚Äù ask people wear wrong (under nose) please fix them. mask wearing customer happens see unmasked customer husband often scream bloody murder employee threat call county health board store head social media saying don‚Äôt enforce mask rule. Several even actually contacted corporate county health commissioner. 

He also got hazard pay taken away despite fact virus obviously gone away job made much difficult potentially hazardous it. read part contact tracing get people read masks?

All middle meat cuts sold large loss. things still somewhat profitable chicken hard come awhile.

Cost distributors sky rocketed, stores sticker shock people without causing issues.   people don‚Äôt grow up, get taller... Yeah I‚Äôm sure much control exert. There‚Äôs nothing stop hospitals reporting numbers anyone. since they‚Äôre business overrun, I‚Äôm fairly sure numbers won‚Äôt go HHS die  would say vacine still 2020 last 2 months. walmart still greeters?

Are people really still blaming missteps ignorance? ignorance. malice, selfish political desire feed perception things back normal sunny ol' Florida. Yeah last checked, Belgium actually covid deaths excess mortality aggressive reporting deaths. Projectile vomiting mask would dangerous, though. eww. Stay home isolate. 

But take point. infected people exhaled green air smelled bad? tangible nature masks' effectiveness would everyone wearing one. Lack enforcement pressure organized crime. average ordinary citizen may may speed more, run red lights, buy weed, organized crime motivation lack morals seize opportunity presents itself.

It makes logical sense community programs begin take hold, support, manpower, economic bases organized crime whittle away, way instantaneous effect police advertising half manpower used to. 38k open child care centers/homes CA-how many kids center?? many total kids attendance? 

Only 1k total confirmed cases past 4 months. deaths assume since none mentioned ( cdc total 31 children 14 US total last weeks reports.)

This actually good news right? ""The largest supermarket chain U.S.""

So, today day learned ""supermarket"" refers large grocery stores, opposed large stores. God, name like begs misrepresented trifled with. looks like clear plastic window assist read lips. see advertised lot. need stand defense employees witness this. takes one person start it, public shaming quite deterrent. Take note Polis Colorado......

Kids need eat. Hell, adults need eat.

Now non-essential workers longer qualify unemployment since jobs back? don‚Äôt return lockdown, folks SOL there‚Äôs childcare access.

 (rank 10 today) atleast leadership acknowledging ignoring pile corpses that's 140k people deep

Honestly, reaction Covid 19 made lose little faith country. Millions lost health insurance, millions facing eviction... 140k died ignorance, insane notion money simply important. now, schools talking sending kids back, corona myth.

The US concerned keeping economy running, forgot thag need living people keep running, need people homes Healthcare keep running. We're facing end, leadership Washington keep together.

Im politician, can't lead people, follow admit that. hope next ruler atleast purge us. Lol. I've seen people Walmart without pants shoes before. Basically nothing waist down. MULTIPLE TIMES. one cared. 

But ya, Masks. going mandate masks. surely strictly enforced. generally would consider looking job walmart, meant walking floor bag masks one hand, stapler other, sign up! US everything China contain virus. Also, pro mask people unlikely show meeting know full people wearing masks. Kroger give damn. want good PR, cheap slave labor, laser tight focus short term bottom line. Everything else meaningless them. convenient... lol Reddit poster Celticmetal thinks Ed Orgeron dumb. can't extract profit born guess virus hitting Republican states hardest longer political virus? emergency powers act president sorts things. Unfortunately people also claim medical condition preventing wearing mask (even don‚Äôt) can‚Äôt questioned due HIPAA. Service still refused far know though.

Edit: regard Oregon least, am. I'm glad hear intend release soon.

No doubt edge next month recovers. Nothing important health people love, take comfort case, numbers husband's favor. everything right sounds like live area provide good hospital care. Even risk good chance making get medical attention. Wishing best both. Well, completely disgardes social distancing rules... risk practice distancing all. one infected, probable chance infected.

But, last weeks following guidelines, chances low. Depends big social bubble is. Legal lurks behind every decision. RemindMe! 21 days live manhattan supposedly educated people lot still think hyped stupid logic care though. least wear mask. ""whistle blower"" arrive America law passed. no. coincidence.  Someone better tell employees difference face mask chin guard... hell getting news? catch reality brotha Marylander, suspect going soon. Governor Hogan starting lay seeds bringing restrictions back still encourage people right thing mode. suspect within week two things continue increase, we'll execute plan.

I've gotten back cynical stuff Northeast got wave everyone making everything much worse, feels like matter time heads back corner country. America 1st help cause people wearing mask get vaccine either Staten Island Bronx infected, close high. Thanks man. 

I really get anything unless comment gets lot votes visible, mostly basic occult things like baphomet figure something. awhile I'll get something interesting though - neatest thing website link dedicated mothman, whole website different things including mothman podcast. shit show Lab Corp send test kit mail back. Week half turn around time. see sell plexiglass another business, might possible give shit people dying covid-19 Walmart today (grumpy) cashier told lady behind fix mask covered nose. think they‚Äôre getting training enforcing policy. get 6 weeks capped working 10 years (13 years job). plus 6 days float holiday. use wish. mostly take time slow. vacations me, undecided breaks throughout year. Leaves plenty family time ""training"" even tho money so-so get spend lots time family. 3 days? musnt paid time get per year!!!?? /r/ABoringDystopia Opps lost bunch them, better count negative don‚Äôt want scare people People Walmart 2.0, featuring tantrum videos adults. Given PTSD psychiatric condition, believe psychiatrist would ideal medical professional consult topic. see would lessen repute. extend shopkeepers privilege letting use force bounce assholes out.

Like one chance put mask on, asked leave, resistance gets cattle prod out. complete surprise. lag reporting case resolution biggest factor, terms math it. younger someone is, longer lag. virus spread exponential bursts. really ook closed cases only, way take current death count, case count several weeks prior. lag fixed, younger/healthier infected person is, longer is.

And really look excess deaths, that's real numbers are. likely die, least likely counted. poor, institutionalized, victim corrupt governance. incentive government that's bound transparency spend money time expensive testing dead bodies, raise numbers make bad situation look even worse. hurts country/state's economy political stability. see govt taking control numbers, cutting cdc out, reason.

In America, Native American totals counted, federal prison released numbers, COVID presentations like strokes considered probably COVID, still data private nursing homes, whistleblower complaints speak states' efforts hide numbers -- many gaping holes, excess deaths way get glimpse full picture. What's area's 5 10 year average deaths per cause/ per age. 

The law big numbers, discrepancies tell full story. I‚Äôm server Texas parents pre existing conditions I‚Äôm currently living them. Everyday go work I‚Äôm frightened kill myself. government doesn‚Äôt care us even don‚Äôt die medical costs joke simply don‚Äôt want lung scaring government cares bailing big oil companies instead working class. Don‚Äôt go restaurants dude washing hands every single second took plates hands touch swipe card pens. touch glasses, wrap silverware touch hands. Like way sanitize every two seconds safe restaurants. People come eat literally cough I‚Äôm grating cheese PANDEMIC. What‚Äôs point wearing masks it‚Äôs two seconds takes walk table door take off. people audacity tip 10% pandemic. American Dream? Can‚Äôt even honest work without risking life anymore embarrassing state affairs. kinda want start coughing kinds people see getting messy. Video, article, one worst video players I've ever seen. 132 believe number looking Google. hopefully that's real number one bullshit ""pneumonia COVID"" numbers tried use. Spanish Flu example.... FACT, recent example last pandemic decade ago, ever heard swine flu?

In FACT, every single pandemic consisted effectively passaged novel virus showed multiple waves infection.

AND FACT, study thing common viruses seasonal flu. 1-2 waves influenza waves year. based science math infection transfer.

So yes, perspective dumb, anticipation 2nd 3rd wave infections. saving lives. punishing women. Honestly, I've become fan new hours operation. 

I get 6:55, wait car 6 minutes till let 7 people line (if that) stroll happy ass grabbing supplies. I've yet stand line since implemented it. aisles stuffed people. I, Walter eloquently puts it, 'get shit get out'. I've told wife people get sick, that's can't anything it. someone get sick, would rather prefer one 'these people' instead random person trying get by. 

Oddly, want Trump Pence get it. succumb, martyr. get it, like strongest people ever, blah blah blah. imagine much better everything would Trump make political r/Masks4All nationwide March/April like almost every country Earth No, right. American voter turnout pathetic embarassing. 

In 2016, 250,056,000 Americans eligible vote, 138,847,000 did. long jim jones thing! ""they"" that. who's ""they"" ? O.o figments imagination without getting politics likely resources testing

think it, unlisted price test USA $130 probably really costs $30 process

lots countries resources, testing, positives, boom Brazil thought happened uncivilized 

But guess what? Wuhan actually pretty epic medical system  I'm looking forward videos. College football probably happening year, maybe stores hire linemen/ tackles near D1 schools. People come bases time. isnt surprising. Yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss Yeah bad dealing pandemic 100 years ago. Thank science deniers Like Florida nurse said informative post (paraphrasing): ""We surge capacity, extra surge capacity, contingency plans convert cafeteria area additional beds, contingency plans convert local stadium makeshift hospital.""

That sounds optimistic. course, essential equipment brought somewhere (federal reserve? military? states?). staff spread thinner thinner. medical personnel places like New York probably volunteering hard hit places speak already. CA. exposed COVID positive person 7/4, told called doctor 7/8, got tested 7/13. told take 72 hrs results told husband probably 96 hrs results sent tests two different labs. Tomorrow day 3 me, we'll see get results. husband asymptomatic. extra week bbq's large gatherings July 4th? stupid. Wtf, mean tell ""it's flu"" thing back too?! Walmart Menards actual security detail door. sure happens people taking aisle 5. Lmfao sub taking comment seriously upvoting it. added /s shit would downvoted oblivion. he's saying long while. keeps setting benchmarks ignoring benchmarks. televise Monday like Live PD. Camera crews stationed Wal-marts country. might highest rated show history  don‚Äôt believe masks bad oxygen levels, I‚Äôm also convinced 1 minute video. Would like see someone waking around half hour pulse ox. think result would same, least won‚Äôt feel foolish sending video. new white house orders still able get accurate numbers? ever close? bad this? ""No Shoes, Shirt, Mask, Service.""  Right, outrage called something small like blow up. It‚Äôs hilarious! I‚Äôm NYC don‚Äôt really see except drive places. remember growing here, would ALWAYS one take cart back return line dad wouldn‚Äôt give shit. 

I‚Äôm glad came across haha! good laughs tonight lol Companies desperately need stand behind employees this. Give every person, greeter cart guy ability remove customer store. room point time fucking around potentially harmful people.  began karen wars People smart enough wear masks shut businesses, governments forced so. Expensive. ice cream, like buy store high price reinforces people idea kind luxury. create revolution website? Sign mailing list today, forget sponsers! recently moved smaller city South Carolina enacted mandatory mask order. Despite Reddit's doom gloom yet see single person flaunt order, reminded wear mask put fuss. little bit leadership goes long way, vast majority Americans know right thing do. Method actors. really commit never break character..ever. going arm teeth it? know Y‚Äôall Qaeda full force buy bullet refills Walmart, too. think fine without people stupid enough avoid treatment conspiracy Cases wed, wh make sure thoughtful. sure what‚Äôs going link posted. may issue BI. information date link (July 10). saw fucked China happening too. Karens Karening. There's $5000 fine wearing mask stores here, store gets $15,000 fine enforcing law. I've heard people complain wear one, noticed anyone store without mask on. even libruls, literally 'everyone us'. nauseating. Job market unstable? Mexicans. Products getting expensive? Chinese. Call center resolve issue? Indians. never Republicans. loathe even hearing talk, must Trumps new grope toy Imagine much better everything would Trump make political r/Masks4All nationwide March/April like almost every country Earth New York going deaths even without nursing home stuff first state hit hard European spread highest population density well boot. big problem though one's really provided better solution feasible time put nursing home patients. lot people realize nursing homes hospitals, they're homes. That's elderly person gets mail, eats food, gets sleep, etc. someone discharged hospital, go back home, happens nursing home lot people. issue ran CDC's projections ended WAY higher ended thanks lockdown social distancing, using statistics mind, going run hospital space WAY sooner could afford kept ""healthy"" people hospital beds healthy enough go home.

Most solutions people proposed exist March early April entire purpose illness COVID. sad reality much could done better facts using. hindsight, probably could figured something known going happen / hospitalization rates, time there's LOT could done hindsight make happen all. go eight eight? isn‚Äôt backed complete data though. short, care kids put back school. ‚Äúdisaster‚Äù one example uniform among doctors best won‚Äôt help it‚Äôll hurt, worst it‚Äôll worse kids. teacher thinks schools open too. 

‚ÄúShould school children return classrooms fall, even amid pandemic might roll year more?

Yes, pediatricians educators say. Recent research indicates children don‚Äôt appear high risk spreading novel coronavirus, say, could harm kids keep home bring back school. ‚ÄúI believe open schools children benefits derive: It‚Äôs social, it‚Äôs emotional, it‚Äôs meals, it‚Äôs safety net,‚Äù said Dr. Jana Shaw, pediatric infectious disease doctor Upstate Medical University. ‚ÄúThere number benefits students derive attending school, they‚Äôre important regardless race income.‚Äù

The largest group child doctors country thinks so. American Academy Pediatrics urges states reopen schools fall students learn better form important social bonds classrooms online.

‚ÄúA lot kids struggling trying learn home,‚Äù said Dr. Ed Lewis, Rochester pediatrician president academy‚Äôs Upstate New York chapter. ‚ÄúHome school. kids need routines. kids really need structure.‚Äù

Children aren‚Äôt able see friends live normal life now, Lewis said, long-term consequences. Many low-income students depend schools breakfast lunch, health care counseling school nurses psychologists. Online learning exacerbates society‚Äôs inequalities; low-income rural families, example, often lack necessary internet connections.

Teachers suspect students mental health problems, abused home, seek help.

‚ÄúWe caught medical conditions school setting would otherwise gone unrecognized,‚Äù said Triana, whose staff school district includes 48 nurses 22 health aides.‚Äù

I mean, think I‚Äôm making trump people love tell people also claiming virus isn‚Äôt real, also telling people get jobs. it? reason covid widespread takes long affect kill people. SARS virus similar didn‚Äôt last nearly long killed people could spread anyone know anything Hydroxychloroquine cocktail doctor talking about? trying give laws want make sure safe. course are! operate pizza joint town NY exactly that, mask service. I‚Äôve called ‚Äòfucking sheep‚Äô, ‚Äòfucking idiot‚Äô, loser among things. even recently started offering people masks don‚Äôt legitimately forgotten vast majority time still refuse. 

It‚Äôs old news places make mandatory, courage stand freedumb fighters. care safety staff customers regulars. one employees doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable confrontation, told get attention immediately. 16 year old girl who‚Äôs first job doesn‚Äôt need yelled scorned following company policy. want part enforce get back somewhat normal quicker. ""Who controls past, controls future: controls present, controls past‚Ä¶"" George Soros also apparently rich guy hand anything. He‚Äôs quite remarkable and, according right, greatest influencer American history. Also he‚Äôs totally ineffectual actually can‚Äôt get anything done. Yes! EXACTLY like you‚Äôre going get live life get sick die! I'm glad making moves, ridiculously late. disappointing go two waves (although technically still first one) stores start making stand. 

I work grocery chain south east US months ago leadership started require employees wear masks, however immense backlash employees leadership backed 'advised' employees wear masks. Going lot angry neck beards there. took stride would see people first month two without masks, ones I‚Äôve seen stores last month I‚Äôve made absolutely fucking infuriated. point walk direction, continue see gonna boil over. really wish staff would better trained it‚Äôs confronting people door forcing basically. Fred Meyer go lot security guards including arm security 30 seconds flat somebody wants talk back. Young people work nursing homes Lmao Toronto mask policy cops even wear masks. Going arrest violator going result even people without masks inside store. thats true....tbh...he actually said recent abc interview thinks people wear masks businesses necessary. look abc youtube. got discussion recently somebody ""claimed voting anymore..because fuck telling wear mask "" o.O 

lol Intentional not, it‚Äôs rather brilliant campaign. Force people face mortality. Maybe ambulance chaser I‚Äôd like think target audience actually teachers.  young people taking seriously. lot grey haired people around refusing wear masks. Every developed nation: got cases control listening scientists practicing social distancing wearing masks.

USA: We're going get cases control leaving everything open testing less reporting tests do.

Covid solved everyone! Better call saul Imagine day 1 Nobody wants Florida, Texas, Arizona. almost like weaponize abortion wedge issue maintain election No, observation. Canada people running inside sneaking without masks, they‚Äôre either refusing pay throwing whenever hand You‚Äôre kind base. think people comfortable getting virus. in, need personal responsibility deal consequences infection. can't hire people it, gladly free. Considering got idiots running states. damn right ny better. Florida hot spot now. guy said camera know asymptomatic was. Good luck tho medical professional consulted psychiatrist. fl gov least let mayors whatever wanted

abbet undermined long could add data states release. said, sites update certain times states release data exact time, sort ongoing thing. That's sites numbers usually day. *sips tea bed*

You say... Pretty sure depends completely live. three ice cream sizes: like it, love it, got it. $4.50, $5, $5.50. Oreo overload delicious. July 22? Everything wearing masks since March New York 1000 cases today. definitely lock back down. Sure can't go get haircut, go get shit faced bar, enjoy movie theaters... dumbass could go casinos.

There's still lot unnecessary travel around town's places essential. hope Dr. Fauci knows support believe lies coming administration. hope r/Masks4All needed much longer seems every day there's adamant deniers.  would appear so. impressive how-can-you-be-this-bad-at-your-job kind way. know virus, beginning, already looked like human beings while. been, would spread across planet earlier.

So leaves one likely alternative - living human tissue Chinese lab months years, screwed virus got out. infected someone lab, person patient zero.

China never admit this, course. American dead since cancelled flight back honeymoon hours boarding repeatedly refused give refund legally according European law. Aka second wave.. prepared. problem many vacationers go bar-hopping partying. can‚Äôt nice things people ruin everybody. Rise karen videos! Nice. Im sure Costco outliers Aw, leave Ducey list... company services apartment complex's pool hired literal security guard.

He's in-your-face, he's kind lifeguard argue Karens sign pool slot.

I'm hoping stores same. College Football probably going happen nationwide year. Imagine Walmart near big D1 school hiring linemen work part time doormen. Imagine government implemented way earlier, would've stayed closed least past memorial day weekend. Nope! Let's drag long possible political bullshit reasons, instead listening health officials scientists stating half year now. ACCEPTABLE. Da fuck know doctor? Yes, doctors (who actually treat covid patients) good point views advice Youtube.

You obviously one could figure out. learn Fauci newspaper? Wtf?! now? be. Nobody said accurate information available, might hit Facebook Twitter feed.  STFU! Bout time guarantee, shipped there. dominate market, biggest named supermarkets. really think way, make great point, really dropped ball huge easiest ""win"" could had. live Vegas. Everyone wearing masks I've been, good reason cases skyrocketed.  recently displeasure visiting Pahrump. Store employees wore masks....but redneck customers? Fuck naaah that's liberal agenda!! Even quarantining big piece contract tracking might interacted became symptomatic. - assume it, others, test really needs come back timely manner.  that‚Äôs motto American get behind! Bout time glad we‚Äôre following walmart‚Äôs footsteps. again. Wait, guys getting PAID? you! Pardon, link broken, skimmed twitter get gist position was, presumed ""All excess deaths assigned Covid."" right jumped gun bit assumed asking good faith. Sorry that.

There data reported individual states, data reported CDC. that, question set data leads?

**Scenario 1 states report data, processed CDC**. happening, CDC states process analyzing Excess Deaths. 1 - 8 week delay state incomplete lag time death occurred death certificate completed, submitted NCHS processed reporting purposes. delay range 1 week 8 weeks more, depending jurisdiction cause death. See information.

(Source: )

Note Excess Deaths meant quick actionable, collection data meant retrospective value. impact lockdowns? many deaths occurred due causes? many due hospitals tied up? many lives saved since people getting car accidents, shootings, drowning, etc. many deaths got over-attributed potentially missed? gets bundled Excess Deaths.

**Scenario 2 CDC leads states reporting data.** poster asserts excess deaths, trickle Covid death count individual state. problem this? surge happened past, hospitals need medical equipment, staff, PPE ***now***, would desperate obtain months ago supposed surge happened.

Again, second scenario based wishful thinking. surge passed, everyone high five believing worst behind us. reality, happening reported CDC weeks, hospitals go capacity, way know true impact Covid Excess Death report. come to. Stores step individually due complete vacuum actual leadership federal level state levels.

It's honestly pathetic America become short time. guy stabbed neck multiple times still critical condition speaking employees refusing service anti-masker town.

I'm super lefty, I'm get concealed carry permit get fucking handgun. People minds right now, ridiculous say, need something protect public (in addition mask).

Fucking idiots. asked manager still fast-tracking new hires hiring background check cleared. said, 'No, stopped COVID over...'

Yet are... imagine acutally ""We found men wore face coverings bigger d*cks maskless counterparts, like, kind lot. research needed preliminary findings suggest high correlation.""

Wow amazing! Spread word! unless contagious. Hey thanks checking in. still don‚Äôt think near quite peak saw NYC. Things definitely rising I‚Äôd surprised don‚Äôt get 1000 cases per day. get 2500 even 2000 daily I‚Äôd surprised wrong! Bad news get even know? Trump control data actually affected end result rather lords money stashed offshore. It‚Äôs called skin game America ~350,000,000 people. Half 175,000,000. Cornavirus world champs undefeated! fact wearing mask big news fucking mind blowing.. know it‚Äôs American friends fellow neighbour would want smart fuck  One friends wears mask driving gets used wearing it. It‚Äôs big deal anything judge someone imo commend you. wife works similar employer. me, got Walmart two weeks ago horrible 26 months working there. Trust me, Walmart give damn employees. store several cnfirmed cases management's concern keeping customers finding out. AAMC issued statement earlier week. They're ones give MCAT believe. know accredit every medical school or, here's crazy idea, wait little longer virus die instead rushing back like idiots can't wait another months treatments vax

we're talking years, we're talking three months people seem incapable discipline  Back march april mask thingy started germany, 2 security guys local drugstore everyone went store mask. security guys gone like past 6 weeks nobody gives fuck masks anymore. People go store without them, wearing incorrectly. even employees wearing them. someone immunosuppressants nearly decade always dread go get food cat. It‚Äôs like 5 months mask wearing though think need someone cattle prod entrance something....not like hard rule follow went ocean city last year bunch pro trump protesters beach everyday. think Maryland actually pretty red places. Thanks Obama.. *sarcasm* Deaths lag.

I think NY state deaths couple months, that's people 4 times less likely die currently. Fair enough. mostly referring Brazil, couldn‚Äôt think name reason. It‚Äôs long day work üòî I'm really hoping means employees start wearing masks noses well. supermarket chain capable realizing needs living people function.  know either cannot find answer, possible many NYC excess deaths constantly evaluated past deaths (more day) counted covids deaths state, worldometer guidelines include deaths. (I distinctly recall NY got 16,000 deaths, sudden jump 20,000 deaths adding untested home deaths. number accepted CDC, returned like 17,000 days later) Sams club work getting one least maskers real. 

i see mask around neck people, pull mask talk people somehow worst ones won‚Äôt put nose. hate annoyed masks putting show. include Fred Meyer QFC?

Please? Atlantic best reporting pandemic. depth sugar-coated. someone lives wiregrass attest this. us wear masks public looked upon. cant understand selfishness people here.....it saddens right now??? Yes! found recently too, bends little stay. I'll find something different, like million options Amazon lol. covid great infecting + people listening wait week important? Considering everyone looked old lady like insane, I‚Äôd say civility never question. still right ways things. It‚Äôs normal behavior. Going way yell ‚Äúget away me‚Äù doesn‚Äôt help anybody. wearing mask? Duh. love keep us updated daily! *Stonks always go up* already has. leader lied cheated way many early business deals. lied cheated way school. continues lie daily basis. absolute piece shit running country. failure nearly every possible way. ""There‚Äôs nothing stop hospitals reporting numbers anyone."" 
It surprise one changes. Fuck Kroger. Fuck wally world too, specifically fuck Kroger. shit needed to, knee-jerk PR save that's four months late. 

New Seasons Trader Joe's taking covid seriously enough I'll shop there, even costs more. Costco even took seriously Kroger, long shot, even though Costco customers seem think still OK breathe pants I'm getting eggs. Ugh. I'm rolling! Thanks laugh!  Same. I‚Äôm constantly pissed everything now. thing pisses DIDN‚ÄôT FUCKING WAY! could handled much better. lot Americans credit, lot us tried responsible taken seriously beginning. enough haven‚Äôt enough leaders haven‚Äôt now.

I'm burned dealing anti-maskers patient zero. another problem people shut fuck up, let talk, get upset ""interrupting"" them. can't walk away cause they'll wont fucking leave. 

How fuck get conspiracy idiots? mean sanitize hands go grocery store I‚Äôm touching stuff moment two put cart.


My keys go hospital me, stay purse day, handle every hours. Keys gross.


Also it‚Äôs necessary touch groceries scan them. scan card glass without touching it, go effort touch it? technicality. Walmart nearly twice many stores, Kroger classified primarily Supermarket whereas Walmart Superstore. essence, Kroger traditional grocery store whole bunch shit (a Supermarket) Walmart grocery store among many services provide. people deserve ""Hero"" pay anything. Infections also delayed, since many tests go people symptoms admitted (not all, at-risk people getting tested). Incubation period adds another 10 days average.

So even TX closed NOW, expect something like 2x-4x current rates reaching plateau.

Also, March 17th, know far far data. always best check dates sources. NAY! BYE FELICIA CUNNINGHAM LOL politicians public figures pull mask make speeches? makes sense sets terrible example wear mask. speak mask up. Uh...what? feel like announced 2 months ago practically every grocery store this. late party? Yeah, good job Cuomo Murphy. mild mistake 60,000 dead people listen anyone else says. feel like going end cheap talk. Unless enforce nothing happen. employees already risking health work sure hell going want physically remove people get confrontation whatever idiot walks hour We‚Äôre talking manufacturing process replicate production pharmaceuticals. narrow variances allowed production aren‚Äôt equivalent making public policy education.

Unless you‚Äôre willing conduct studies every school system/district United States, use much evidence available. 

By logic, you‚Äôre suggesting need study use masks every city, town workplace determining efficacy preventing spread virus.  I'm sorry mention record breaking deaths article? nobody criticizing OP changing title? Jeeezus, ahh hell no, fuck noise. 

I hope least get unemployment? TJs crew member here! confirm, enforce mask wearing social distancing since day 1 lockdown, GTFO Yep. Business booming, don‚Äôt get extra people, we‚Äôre burning OT like tomorrow, can‚Äôt afford pay us ‚Äúhero pay.‚Äù

We don‚Äôt even time get jobs done without extra cleaning expect us well. Trump‚Äôs donkey Quixote. Ok thank you. worried today. might issue states like Florida chose deceptive?  Cowards waited Walmart  Trump uses Executive Orders time enforce shit wants, including travel bans one asked for. Wal Mart actually enforce this. Requiring enforcing two vastly different things. need teach employees correct way wear well. Absolutely foolproof experiment. peak scientific discovery.

/s I‚Äôm toxicologist. saying T-cell thing isn‚Äôt validated cure covid Given infinitely cheaper easier drink excesd home that's truly avsurd statement. They'll start attributing deaths ""antifa"". Naw, spot critters mile away. *that‚Äôs* hot tater. Lol deathsü§£ kemp, issued order forbidding cities enact stricter restrictions his. Certainly health care professionals get first, doctors nurses spreading patient (that's elderly died old folks homes).

But yes, risk next, similar flu vaccine prioritized elderly season general public. covers 25% population. riots, wealthy politicians want prioritized. shitloaf sounds like worst dish could bring potluck. don‚Äôt go church turned fine! going bring back ‚Äúhero pay‚Äù employees? guy looks fat fuck lol super unhealthy They‚Äôve supposedly required stores state last week people still walk around Walmart without masks. isn‚Äôt gonna shit NSW live 3 new cases investigation yet linked existing cluster. contract tracing loses effect easily get away.

This first unknown origin cases since first outbreak contained. Fingers crossed see anymore locked time. ""All shit""

My friend. stop gasping air.

It's like... work. breath anyway. gotta breathe different. Shit like I'm asking ya move fridge üòÇ world wide. USA?? Asking Karen shop Kroger. They've signs say customers required wear masks I've seeing angry white dudes strutting around without masks least 2 months. doubt anything change. ilk reason world way is. 

Humanity like train. guys last car purposefully stripped it‚Äôs wheels dragging tracks, slowing whole train down. saddest part revel it. Either fix shit someday going pull bolt. Otherwise going cause train come complete stop. Or..now would better.. mask made 22nd? Glad big businesses stepping leaders 3 months late  ""We discovered doctors putting fake bodies trucks get medicaid money!""

/s (but, real, totally see accusation happening) Boycott Wallmart. Simple. Unpaid first responder here. agree more. probably doesn‚Äôt even look numbers every day. every week. month.

&amp;#x200B;

LMAO don‚Äôt suspect much actual thinking happening cro-magnon cranium his. happening, doubt it‚Äôs considering anyone himself. I‚Äôm rooting virus. masks. social distancing. I‚Äôm hoping thing takes least 30% population. Oh boo hoo, 50 year old tin foil hat clad man baby spreading conspiracy theory‚Äôs around, tell us gran-gran got abducted flying saucer Best what? Burying people? Almost guaranteed trump co. getting convalescent plasma injections reg Fake news! China must billions US already whatever number control outbreak equally ineffective! fascinating thing fact group people likely complain ""entitled"" people looking ""handouts"" facebook.

I hope time last 4 years psychologists working way explain going country. level hypocrisy outright rejection reality science seems occurring unprecedented level.

I used think religion manipulated population taking advantage lack education information resources, explanation longer holds. America, anyone access information ever before, yet willful rejection reality. point millions people believe X unequivocally prove X wrong front eyes say, ""you're wrong,"" debate.

Someone valid explanation happening defeat/prevent it, see things getting worse. like nightmare think much sometimes. followed ‚ÄúI work hospital, covid patients. really don‚Äôt want touch keys.‚Äù 

??? 
If *that* dangerous around, earth would knowingly put others harm's way like store first place? I'll leave know thank you. I'll still go FM though seems self selecting thing clientele. almost Kroger (proper) place go want wear mask. I'm pretty sure science what'll save us one... holy moly, world get article? that's says all. live, sheriff said going enforce things. can't start now? Hitler GOP‚Äôs President they‚Äôd STILL defend him, straight trains leave Auschwitz. They‚Äôre delusional. They‚Äôre much like sheep bad things happen experimental vaccine (symptoms injection deadly infection later), want know vaccinated 500 people, 20000 more. 

In case Moderna phase trial discussed today: 45 people got vaccine twice, 15 low dose, 15 intermediate dose, 15 high dose. young (18-55) healthy.

If read paper carefully, find that: 

* One person broke hives (urticaria) legs first low dose injection, receive 2nd dose.
 
* Fourteen (mid/high dose) people developed fever 2nd injection, highest temperature 39.6C, considered severe. 

* half reported local pain, fatigue, chills, etc. Fairly normal vaccination symptoms. 

Now effects still better getting Covid - know yet vaccine actually offers protection, know worst side effects: 
1/45 (or 1/42, really) fairly high fever, 1/45 (or 1/42) got hives legs. Maybe two unlucky, test 600 people (phase II), see that, conclude problem. see 12 people hives, even higher fever people, need assess trade-offs. 

If jumped straight phase III would testing 30000 people (Moderna phase III). 700 risk hives based current information, 700 high fever, possibly get supermarket, take mask walking car. people trashy Walmart's going go? wear masks Monday stale? get save economy narrative. long think economy downward trend? could get infections control, faster economy could recover. longer takes so, longer economy suffers. economy suffer long takes get better. wear masks, shut businesses absolutely essential, longer businesses suffer. almost like bars restaurants feel left important grocery stores essential needs people. that's bullshit. Start now...took til 50 &amp; finally changed lol, IT!!!! Hey, july 22nd birthday! Kroger's inadvertently giving birthday gift! IMO, failure state leadership. Yeah noticed quickly trying replicate social credit score ""racist"" label Wal-mart state sponsored goods provider seems viable too. ugly.   things. even read this??

""For starters, fact 68.4 percent tests taken urgent care center Corona came back positive mean 68.4 percent residents infected. ‚ÄúFor sure, persons seeking antibody testing probably higher likelihood positive general population,‚Äù said Professor Nash. ‚ÄúIf went Corona tested representative sample, wouldn‚Äôt 68 percent.‚Äù""

I'm sure understand shared.  guess celebrate investors pump money markets.

Like one investor said, people die virus means less people left virus kill, sees bad news really good news.

Crazy planet 2020 Weird. Walmart nearly twice many stores, they've signage shit since late March. least that's case Mississippi. ""But... that's even worse! Right COVID-19, new unknown disease deadly popped killed million people year? stop it, grandpa?""

*Gently lift finger smile*

""Ah, see, libs' coronavirus hoax snuffed out, that's matters!"" walk past sign specifically telling enter, trespassing would matter? means days actually higher reported. change actual amount cases. Yep, states rights issue. fed can‚Äôt mandate something like masks without act Congress, never happen. Vote Nobody

Nobody tells truth,

Nobody keep election promises

Nobody listen concerns

Nobody cares!

Nobody TELLS TRUTH! May odds ever favor. Kroger operates quite regional store chains. I've never seen Kroger live several Mariano's (which owned Kroger) Well said. Nothing wrote anything covid even need read article know click bait headline, especially coming Canada requiring masks 5 months pandemic proactive. I‚Äôm commenting anything thats right word they‚Äôre doing. frequent one (can imagine saying today).

I go back forth opinions Wolf. Agreed early on, thought lost plot bit delayed re-opening May / early June, especially protests \[basically broke rules\].  understand recent change. He's basically pulling back bit avoid another total shutdown later.

Also agree mask requirements always have.  Medical issues exempt, include ""mah freedoms"" excuse. Ulysses Grant Mine hands door, live founding city, Cincinnati Oxford decent chance release year, according Telegraph: "" Professor Adrian Hill, director Jenner Institute University Oxford, told webinar Spanish Society Rheumatology ""best scenario"" would see results clinical trials August September deliveries October. ""

They already started production, distributed soon research evidence comes in, skipping months manufacturing delays. goes well, emergency approval granted Oxford vaccine go healthcare workers elderly (if works them) first. UK looking possibility distribution average citizen near Christmas 2020. clear countries expect receive it. ""Matt wanted know whole British population could vaccinated, whereby Sir John noted could ready ""by Christmas"". added team ""changed approach vaccines forever"" manufacturing vaccine approval, claims sped process three months."" walmarts outside US Lol, Sets fire alarms house burns down. Better late never? body produces small amounts. High amounts antibodies outside active infection typically indicative autoimmune disorder.  nice it? It‚Äôs store policy. People either don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs getting annoying seeing poor employees get verbally assaulted people talking shit know can‚Äôt fight back. Hopefully involves lizard people. person clearly raised next power plant. Eric Bouchat making ignorant, insensitive comments. Want guess party belongs to? You‚Äôll right. thank god cities counties enact mask ordinances, means east TN continue act like entire region infected brain-eating amoebas. west TN doing...alright county city levels. could better. deaths rising now, expected anyone interpret basic graphs time takes people die. people still take seriously, still want go normal ignore reality point. Well normal lot people die others change they're behaviour wear mask stay home much possible. day arguing someone said IFR less 0.2% deadly flu, I'm even American. tf lies coming from. Yes indeed /u/_notoriginal_ : thought let cute girls free?

Bouncer: do.  Great article  everyone COVID respirator, always selfie? Something odd imo.

They take share pics show loved ones they're OK. remember, they're alone. family can't physically visit hospital. Hence pics. What?? 
No don't. 
Walmart Kroger.  know, lot Texans shit talking NYC region governors. Let's see happens month. Agreed. used shop Kroger exclusively, avoid Walmart whenever possible. must say, Walmart ahead Kroger safety mandates. Seems like whenever Walmart makes decision, Kroger follows suit days later. point may rethink allegiance. Talking percentages. human race ungrateful. Dethsantis [There's also fact 65% infections US came people fleeing really way stop that, either. Studies comparisons diseases spread provides effective forecast. may get estimated numbers correct predict every aspect future, know diseases transfer immune systems work. 

To avoid second wave see massive sudden dropoff, sustained immune response recovered patients. seen things, nothing, absolutely nothing, indicate disease continue spread develop 2nd likely least 3rd wave.

You can't wish away scientific research studies.

You argument here, nothing. provided zero intellectual discourse shown fundamental ignorance scientific research, frankly, common sense.  also true, hard say new rules moving forward. hope business stays sustainable, I'm worried favorite places philly/PA Mine says required city ordinance it‚Äôs enforced slightest. enforced employees.  I‚Äôm ‚Äúdangerous around‚Äù. least people going bars restaurants right now? need get groceries. It‚Äôs thing go besides going work.


It‚Äôs like, minimize contact other, wouldn‚Äôt we? instance really easy scan card held up. Bull. top 25 COVID-19 hot spots popped last two weeks, 18 non-metropolitan counties. Arkansas, North Carolina Texas set records mid-June number people entering hospitals COVID-19. Georgia‚Äôs daily reported death toll COVID-19 35% compared three weeks think given little information title posting far suggestive actually stated article.

Obviously, police shot person without valid reason outrage. estupido pero somos pendejos en los estados unidos. Lo siento, es la verdad. appreciate compassion sympathy know. think alot people hurting right now, especially people lost loved ones COVID. kills know still bodies ditch Hart Island NY NY changed claiming timeline bodies made shorter. Many people time plan cremation let lone anything resembling burial. Im officially diagnosed COVID 19 today. everything right. wear masks. work home. leave house buy food supermarket. family stays home. kids havent seen friends months. gone protests anything like that. God forsaken plague. Chances masks have, shit filter virus.  people pick choose policital ideologies random reason disregard medical advice really pisses off. wife, gets thing, might survive. fought bronchial infections life. I'm sorry, can't support mass demonstrations reason now. 

As impact Floyd's death psyche black man...I say this. awful see man murdered? Yes. like murder. Floyd's skin color cant relate it. skin color even factor in. reason reactions wholly unwarranted. epidemic numbers people killed cops. unjustified.  protests amounted nothing mayhem murder. Could stopped? Probably not. expoloited? Yes. Nothing came IMO hate violence. 

Well I'm rambling. COVID kicking ass.  make this, I'm never taking life freedoms granted. you‚Äôre upset mega corporations unlimited funds allowing research customers want combination current science tells us..and conflicts silly tinfoil hat narratives. Keep dreaming grocery stores somehow ‚Äúmanipulating‚Äù asking wear mask.

FYI what‚Äôs end game ‚Äúmanipulation‚Äù results business likely ending FEWER customers? makes sense you?  DeSantis enters chat... ""We're great!"" lawyer here. response said, emergency powers president vast. There's two issues though. One enforcement, can't force local law enforcement enforce emergency powers like that. Congress sorts levers pull force state compliance (namely money), would likely unconstitutional. States granted police powers health welfare citizens Tenth Amendment. assistance Congress enforcing nationwide ban would met constitutional challenges. There's leeway emergency powers president, would see challenges well reason.  Misleading headline, wearing mask started incident. killed presumably threatening lives police officers. Eh, state mandatory mask policy stores even signs doors, people still don‚Äôt wear employees told argue it. It‚Äôs annoying. real question is, took long? fuck wrong companies?

Then loopholes, ""unless medical condition, even though legal right ask medical conditions.."" Every moron pretend medical condition. medical condition fine walk around outside means can't wear mask. Ok idiots? Asthmatics wear masks, deal it. they're fine. 

USA dump. Can't wait till buried ash heap history. I'm pretty sure could slide interstate commerce somehow Black Death still world. It‚Äôs called Bubonic Plague bacterial (not virus). caught early treated antibiotics (unlike COVID). I‚Äôm Colorado every years cases pop up.  Aughhhhh Trump. Trump got freedom fighters side. Trump told bend over, took right ass. met Stalin ‚ÄúEverything changed Kroger attacked‚Äù Mauschwitz Thanks info! doubt it‚Äôs real scary it‚Äôs hard know believe comes numbers. saw article troubles CDC may getting Holy crap, virus going back time, 2021 years, infecting Romans, Thracians, Toltecs? always funny see Americans talking propaganda entire nation built it.  Logged COVID-20. Like Chief Wiggam; *You've called wrong number, is.....9..1.......2* waiting week? I‚Äôm surprised- I‚Äôm Chesco seen people without masks; it‚Äôs definitely exception. Ditto Ohio. aren‚Äôt allowed kick customers anything. ask wear mask that‚Äôs it. We‚Äôve pretty much agreed ignore problem entirely there‚Äôs point getting yelled 15 minutes people aren‚Äôt wearing one it‚Äôs ‚Äúright‚Äù whatnot. could something would different though. ?  Yes, look gotten us, nearly 3.5m infected nearly 150k dead. Broooo googled Felicia Cunningham.

Tf that?  Oh sure. Find scape goat. Where??  I‚Äôm perturbed  black death virus. caused bacteria killed normal antibiotics. *Water. Earth. Fire.

- Counties report daily numbers. screw bleeding obvious

- Counties *don't* report CLI directly (instead relying *ESSENCE* system built CDC DARPA monitoring ILI, Influenza Like Illness). obvious place lie

- Lie *total number tests* likely. Target 3% positivity rate means testing sufficiently menards across work increased police interventions since stopped allowing children store. amount people freak people trying *protect* unreal. Earth isn‚Äôt real Yup- Governor Shit tried keep wraps. Questioned local news stations, reps denied it. got leaked new sources forced hold news conference. doubt governors done same. Make Canada Great Again! /s much fucking content r/publicfreakout monday. That's George Washingtons Air Force operation COVFEFE kept us safe Caravans 19 liberal Covids paid George Soros Considering going sitting parking lot snacks watch sub irl don‚Äôt think know make good headline KAREN GONNA PISSED!!! armpit always spreads B.O. I'm going keep wearing mask, even cases ""gone"". Hopefully doctors scientists silenced still report coronavirus cases. Someone still report new coronavirus data, someone will. means necessary, mean put mask go out. go essential needs skip bars/large gatherings months.

Instead, people collecting unemployment checks, paying rent, hitting beaches, bars, clubs.

We've pointing fingers foreign adversaries illegal immigrants years. Fear mongering alarmist headlines justify inflated defense budgets, freedoms stripped, protectionist policies. 

Turns greatest threat America Americans refusing wear masks social distance. fucking ironic. America finally act like normal country once. copied Thunderf00t? theater wal mart. They‚Äôll someone checking door MAYBE enforcing it. you‚Äôre inside store one give shit. weird Kroger largest chain, I'm surprised chain that's popular 50 states. Similar like McDonald's, Walmart, Starbucks, Applebee's.. etc  long site Johns Hopkins longer access data? hospitals going send data Washington exclusively put counties‚Äô states‚Äô websites?  closed middle high schools opened elementary elementary schools take middle high schools help social distancing else could make assertion information hand. 

I lumping UK EU mistake. apologies. obesity US legendary. realize y'all bunch fat fucks, too. haha stop burning down, would it? *Just saying* work. anti-maskers sure hell wont take vaccine. It‚Äôs new Covid 2 step. 2020? like unfortunately America Walmart even let return/exchange clothes right now. dad bought pair shorts ago large, Walmart already telling hang until.....someday. :/ read

The **facts** say otherwise.

But know do? add idiots block list. *click*. Ahh. average IQ people see went 2 points!

Ahh hell, since like helpful, since thread rightfully killed mods, apparently well versed practices, I'll throw bone give hint towards educatating little headline saw, one existed time posted different.

Look ""article title rotation SEO"". 

You're welcome. I'm Fauci statues city squares. Kids also die COVID. less often. side effects well. remember reports Italy.

Also, kids bring disease households. parents, grandparents, siblings etc. 100,000 + deaths since pandemic started earlier year.

Auto accidents deaths US last year: 40,000

Influenza deaths last year US: high end 60,000 is. local Walmart hires police around holidays. must fucking genius then. muh FrEeDoM darn libs. Really though I‚Äôm sorry work semi high risk job get laughed wearing mask. Oh good old land Dixie. Describe ‚Äúreal job‚Äù me? likely correct, we‚Äôll find literature starts coming iut small percentage tourists willing spend two weeks quarantine. would kill half vacation time alone. free2Bdum still get 1 10 douche wears chin warmer mouth warmer. everybody wears masks properly asked leave virus keep spreading thanks idiots ma-freedom morons. better nothing. want tell families 130k+ dead Americans BS? Id love see it. think we'll begin see Kawasaki like diseases spike 2 weeks. important thing note Kawasaki like diseases tend tied respiratory illnesses (they increased swine flu). However, Covid appears much higher chance causing Kawasaki like diseases... DeathSentence cases US cannot contact traced unknown origin. spikes likely hundreds contributing causes. mayor supposed enforce existing mandate mandate? reading right?  Good.  English article, Hindi. 

European Japanese English articles use local currencies metric units measurement need make conversion imperial USD anyways

I see plenty non English European language articles posted though

You need learn conversion lakh crore done it. different knowing much one euro USD work Sprouts we've required masks whole time. I'm surprised Kroger far behind. really sucks falls minimum wage retail employees enforce this. kick people store every day get really angry.

A lot customers wear mask get past door immediately take off. Others ignore completely ask mask go get manager kick out. I've customer try show fake face mask exempt card before. worst one guy threatened kill manager throwing signs around, called cops time.

And one thing deal kind customers lot time hire brand new 18 year old 5'0"" girl stand door tell let people virtually training. could really use sort security guard something.  untrue?  Sure, first, that. could keep quite while, eventually political blame works way political chain. Probably sooner later numbers reported media Florida whole, state gets attention, people ask: action state level? think big mistake understanding math exponential growth - thinks ride out, get bad, can't ride out, get bad. Also, local school boards forced open state getting LOT parents upset. *What year it?* Buddy imagine America.  that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs going right middle shit fest. Great. Reduce population. message this. 

Wear fucking mask social distance people die many lose jobs satire? Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. mask dbags get treated like drunks gonna awesome weeks Yeah he's saying makes sense think even interesting Decameron Merchant Venice. see masks exaggerated beak-like noses worn ward plague. 

But look ask questions. production watching women showing bare breasts? connection plague? interesting question answer fascinating. Anybody know answer? UK here.
Yup local parks car park converted extra testing facility.
Didn't expect last weekend drove there. repost gateway pundit post worth reading see badly one mangle data fit agenda.  Great news! actually quit job week this. Oregon requires masks public spaces threat losing business license. front end cashiers told handle could lose jobs business shut down.

Guy came without mask on, hand. asked wear it, put ear. asked support manger refused help went threatened 86ing store, ignored me, asked store manager help. also refused help.

I went store owner quit job there. paid good enough deal shit. Constant fights customers people wanted fight me.

Hire doorman buiness owners reading this. Agreed. I‚Äôd rather alive depressed temporarily dead permanently tho. hi! current kroger employee here. hazard pay, right allowed tell people leave they‚Äôre wearing masks. manager that, another customer complains. employee. likely isn‚Äôt going enforced all. masks required county already, signs EVRRYWHERE around store. masks. can‚Äôt say anything! y'all says everything need know perspective virus. 60% today tiny border county 2% states population. Hidalgo county racking disproportionate amount deaths. district Northern California nothing. Parents allowed campus teachers ""have"" wear mask, chrome book drop day principal even one chin, hope there. daughters middle school full, signed remote lost spot even though assigned school. shared plan B parents asking. reporting highly questionable. area, ICU full yesterday 48 COVID patients. Today, number COVID patients dropped 24. ICU still full. Something seems highly suspect.

Edit: Texas Green worst color choice. top level orange yellow signal ""everything fine."" democracy though? Vote guy represents people? Looking outside, feels like skew results reduce voice cities living days. believe certain point early Chinese outbreak shortage PCR tests, addition using CT scans diagnose, giving everyone showed hospital CT scan check COVID, regardless arrived hospital. try leading? know, assign task force diagnose block fix it, activate national guard help logistics, use state budget buy supplies?

""You're right, take wife dinner. Thanks idea!"" - Ron DeSantis I'm manager grocery store implemented mask requirement two weeks ago. I'm guy clerks call customers want know wear mask. countries watching like entertainment show sort.

Its pretty sad can't figure nation lol.  strongly oppose McConnell's #1 priority 5 year liability shield.

 

Businesses need held accountable lives risked lost. lot cases hire police department directly. know I‚Äôm it‚Äôs almost $400 hour one officer. think understand either. clearly hear want hear words actually spoken.

Dude point walked Donny fucking wife think using dick remove obstruction throat probably even thank saving studies show inhaling alcoholic vapor lungs kills bacteria viruses inside lungs helps clear them.

Really wanna link assuming we're stupid question absurd claim? name Krogers Michigan, anyone know is? It‚Äôs actually insanely ironic sent that. You‚Äôre one consistently wrong entire time thinks you‚Äôre expert topic formal education in. 

I provided sources, evidence education, rational arguments ideas. provided nothing except insults hand-waving.

Do actual response? hope armed. stupid sounds - many people acting violent belligerent faced rules. heard 2 accounts directly 2 separate people (one working drug mart, UPS store) person said come back shoot girl, customer would burn store ground. 

Crazy shit. Yup. I'm getting ready delete Twitter Facebook. friends Florida Texas still lockdown, saying let run course, understanding health care get overrun happening. self employed (and worried business/mental health), goes towards Federal Government reaction/support lack of. 

If people took seriously earlier, could avoided lockdown drawn out. GASP! mean even happen, there's thing ""underlying condition"" prevents wearing mask. Huh, googled looked examples. yeah, looks lot like them. didnt realize big thing, though suppose have. simply go. way beyond useful life. shit *first* relief bill, 12th. Well actually long term, insurance companies America better whole may take centuries. strong survive obese, weak, imbusils, diabetic die off. intentional. America would gone broke 10-20 years current projections covid heart issues diabetes combined.  Nah man, Zelienople. yet WOW I‚Äôm ok. Arlington? called us heroes May. Ohio go Stay Home orders within two weeks. individual county mask mandates enforced. 

The anti-maskers forcing this. ignore warning. Covid killed twice many Americans half time. could always opt go Richard, Rich Rick. must like jokes. 90's baby. Huh? Lol ‚ÄúbUh MuH fReEdUmB!!‚Äù Unfortunately going lot workers already tough getting abuse. things seen sub else disgusting, makes really biggest supermarket world underpaid workers host Totally supportive decision though good them. think would happen, feel bad going get shouted put danger. Like really bad

I really hope hire professional security stand door enforce requirement, least stores bad neighborhoods. fuck cops grocery stores schools? normal Americans? Suddenly urge buy scrubs wear public. Real people don‚Äôt shop anyway LOL sounds like garbage source Damnnn... there's always tomorrow Eh, think bit subtle analysis. point mansion many rooms never seen enough space organize toys. mansion space filled empty rooms explore like treasure chest filled diversions. 

What mansion without garden, example. garden mean loses appeal. Sure wealthy inhabitants might leave rough work landscapers doubt lady house indeed dearly love trim precious rose bushes front hedge. sorts diversions quite attractive well-heeled mansion dwellers. 

Or look heated swimming pool another instance. Sure owners seen pool many times still enjoy swimming day day. pool pool used indefinitely. 

So point rich person goes remote gated mansion they're touring rooms, they're using facilities extent pleasure eating, playing doubt fucking well. put another way, indeed enjoy great degree topic Decameron. Well actually drastic making be, seems like people would line kind think serious. bump road, however significant, overcome time journey continue. Remember stories US came together made sacrifices WWII?  Remember taught America great people come together times need. seems ‚ÄúMy freedoms important life‚Äù. Man wish better person used Make America great slogan. We're Trump.  looks like one immune due T-cell memory, gave T-cell memory less likely develop severe COVID. Hahahahhahahahahaaa biggest fear disease right now. I‚Äôm actually really worried could decimate population ways couldn‚Äôt even imagine. point outsiders sit back watch fall America Shit, sent $500 must didnt work! One bear way see virus going strong 6 months now, mass infertility would seen now. also report qualifications positive covid fucking stupid?!? Since Americans ""what about"" mentality. ""You whatever want long someone worst equal you""  Go find local PA newspaper read comments every story Covid. think Wolf putting people chains live human sacrifices instead telling people wear mask. gonna look back 20 years massive fuck across board. people rational intelligent you‚Äôd correct. 

There insignificant portion country thinks world flat, 9/11 Holocaust never happened, never landed moon, etc. 

they‚Äôll call COVID hoax right stupid brain goes dead minutes COVID‚Äôs cytokine storm shuts heart. hope get old sooner well, u know, won't. America go full children men there's data Florida small handful counties even bothering test children, seeing [31.1% positivity -nervous Ohio- think OP might reading wrong article preferred source news pandemic viruses. Hard (R). Modeled whole campaign Trump's ""business leader anti-politician"". course Republitards ate up, even worse considering came right Mary Fallon might worst governor ever state Oklahoma.

The best part recently party, basically controls levels Oklahoma government, started vetoing kinds stupid shit trying extreme, that's saying *lot*. cares...no one lives anyways. Pretty smug knowing .9 bigger .1 turns late, half assed shutdown quickly turned political contact tracing mask requirements reopening early best way handle pandemic entire investigation hoax

I'm sure understand meaning word seem like kind person tough time Trumps re-election

You mean patriotic American functional brain working memory? long virus live different surfaces? read sites said cardboard upto 24hours, stainless steel 3 days, copper 4 hours importantly plastic upto 3days although one study said could potentially live plastic till upto 7 days. true? weren‚Äôt world war 2 7 years though, that‚Äôs blatant number manipulation. began 1942, makes average 104,200 deaths per year. Still great looking huh? Well US population risk getting COVID ~328,200,000. estimated number US servicemen involved WW2 16,000,000. 

Lets little math. 127,000/328,200,000 .0004%. Let‚Äôs generous extrapolate throughout year 4 months. .0012% Americans risk contracting COVID probably die. assuming 127,000 deaths actually died COVID didn‚Äôt die it, big ol gray area we‚Äôre gonna ignore.

Now let‚Äôs compare risk WW2. 104,200/16,000,000 .0065% people risk dead per year. That‚Äôs one average year 4 deadly years. virus likely piddle next summer latest probably kill rate throughout get better treating ‚Äúcurve flattened‚Äù

This virus deadly WW2. Let‚Äôs maybe fearmonger. Boy big surprise way thinking severe asthma. issues whatsoever wearing mask respirator. Honestly US phase 3. Use us guinea pigs see happens. Sorry. stand corrected. WH might justify need data order disperse remdesivir resources. 
In document mention mechanism distribution resources. 
Seems bit confusing. build capacity CDC? sure collected, analyzed, disseminated political lens. 

One misleading stat day make COVID go away. go? take issue them? already tools fix this. Numbers sorta cooked. both? 2020...

That's I'm saying.   looking mask mandate California basically need mask hit public space indoor outdoor. walk beach today would say probably good 20% people mask. Crowds pretty avg. lot bloodshed future.  UK stopped testing comparison useless.

It's way around. We've recently *started* testing significant numbers. We're testing (per capita) medium large sized country, time infections happening, testing people made US look good.

We missed well 90% cases. swear, like fucking movie script. close casinos right now? control right Joe Biden comes power. sorry lackluster federal response major barrier proper reopening. President mentally fit surround clue manage pandemic. shut anything considered high-risk keep closed January 2021. start closing moderate-risk stuff well states control. need total lockdown partial lockdown maximum, high, moderate risk activities administration changes. 

I know manage deniers there. Education going work think authoritarian response question. Unless genius get sadistic pleasure fighting Bill Barr gang, forget authoritarian response. people making unemployment employed. time got test results symptoms already tail end. NYC reporting close 1000/day pretty quickly then? Bet they‚Äôll counted toward Covid death toll relevant authorities... read study early bald risk factor dying Covid, so... don‚Äôt want Arizona :( Americans,

Do know plan is? seems everyday see news article, everyone running around headless.

But comes overarching discussion gun ownership US, small irresponsible men hide behind skirts ""responsible gun owner"". saying guns responsibly, shift problem gun ownership itself, ""bad apples"". problem course, many bad apples cause many issues stage perhaps best conclude average person allowed carry death machine them. 

But whenever someone mentions that, ""responsible gun owners"" like come woods carry torch gun ownership general, discussion fizzles problem persists.

The problem bad gun ownership large needs society general outweigh rights needs responsible gun owners. can't recognize that, think ""responsible"" all, frank. hobby worth damage causing. almost scenario's less lethal weapon (taser, pepper spray, etc) suffice self-defense. valid reason gun. broader sense, civilized society need average citizens carry lethal weaponry. continuing guns perpetuating larger problem, therefore cannot considered ""responsible"" view.

*shit* hundreds things, debates span multiple topics solve multiple problems once. Yup. limiting park capacity all? would make difference park closed, curious. live 35 minutes outside Orlando know idea theme parks low risk place absolutely asinine. density new York new jersey? going ridiculous numbers gonna go US ""magically"" upcoming days/weeks. Everyone even half brain know is. Anyone think might actively trying get numbers up? one election quickly booted blackmailing mistress. Vaccines typically create lot moer Memory B cells infection. severe infection, immune system creates short-lived cells (which ""cheaper"" produce) deal flood virions. vaccine like slow burn wildfire, immune system responds creating memory cells.

So vaccines actually better catching disease immunology point view. Hopefully that's also true Covid-19. millions wont spreads impoverished situations. supporters one spreading doesnt mean ones die greater clip. Weve already seen higher death rate minorities arent typical Trump voters. happening Iowa time too. Kim Reynolds cunt wouldn‚Äôt have, keyboard warrior. necessarily want kill people instead continue infecting people indefinitely. like... need tests look overall number deaths going up. one country five times number deaths usually have, 1.2 times many deaths normal, latter clearly better. 

A dead body dead body regardless caused it. can't fake that. People denial matter rate. 

I remember people saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know anyone covid! think it‚Äôs fake!‚Äù

Then ‚Äúoh yeah friends cousin it.‚Äù

It‚Äôs getting closer know someone has/had it. old coworker mine, parents it. Mom mild dad ICU.

And yet people still say wasn‚Äôt bad made be. Unfortunately large part country stopped trying control spread infections. absolutely sad That‚Äôs Karen move imaginable regularly shop Walmart, gone since Covid, heck implemented now?? guess figured since grocery store rule months, already standard. again, also live state \*completely\* stupid right now. Damn. ""You allowed hold people accountable endangering lives others"" 
 
What villain. Hope Georgia happy election decisions. Yeah, impressive part laugh face outright hearing that. see relevance... one Sweden trying make success story. It‚Äôs usually nationalities try make utter failure success story order promote narrative country do. Swedes basically add context blatant misinformation. need racist senile white men run country; way fix mess! want entire system break honestly. root cops super violent root blm rioters. want cops chased cities states. want mass death virus makes people want stay away other. want every single norm false ideal destroyed abandoned. 

It‚Äôs broke. Top bottom. Time reset. Aye friend get bad accident work year. Bad accident arm lost chunk ..him needed skin graft. big smoker years. intention stopping. Til said ""Smoke lose hand"" Cigarettes slowly killing him? Cool. Possibly quickly taking hand? Stopped smoking day.  


Smaller consequences sometimes feel real. die least dwell could done differently. probably lots time dick work. becomes real immediate consequence might care about. Common, false. time development (which already done). testing process generally last 2 years so. part testing process skipped - we're phases time, rather sequentially. larger financial risk, health risk. starting second wave look things... true. I'm old enough remember people knowing AIDS transmitted, getting blood transfusions, people pulling kids schools it. Google Ryan White, story educated many us Ofc not, laws bring revenue. think Dennis Leary joke, could Norm. I'm sure Carlos Mencia stole joke did. I‚Äôm really curious reinfection articles get much hate sub.

Anecdotally, know people COVID, seemed recover couple months, recently started displaying symptoms again. 

Their doctors think they‚Äôve either never fully recovered, gotten again. Testing unreliable, making harder get clear picture.

Yes, need anecdotes. it‚Äôs like people aren‚Äôt trying ‚Äî it‚Äôs easy thing get clear picture on.

But again, something goes narrative, shouldn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs considered. logic aiding abetting bioterrorism citizens united states.

But antimaskers already bioterrorists. seek intentionally willfully spread disease harm kill fellow Americans.

These people insane indication United States fallen. cases- assuming disease goes dormant hides body, viral remnants vs reinfections. Considering crappy testing (over 20% false negatives), supposition didn‚Äôt severe reaction likely build immunity (lack access testing hospitalized)- seems mistake assume people can‚Äôt get reinfected. think immune system, though.

Obesity leads hypertension, also comorbidity.

That said, think simply telling overweight obese people lose weight effective strategy undersells difficult weight loss many people. No. Medical professionals soldiers. took job help sick. sign potentially die service duties.

Calling heroes, soldiers, warriors, people ""the front line"", normalizes deaths makes seem acceptable sacrifice. normal acceptable. Good question. getting number now? health departments state directly? Wasnt CDC doing? Well that's convenient TBF family accuses crazy, often steel resolve double-down I'm not. dont think crazy theory. Multiple doctors floated idea second infection worse ADE. Dude, literally gave link FDA page says rescinded emergency approval HCQ COVID-19 treatment, report gathered showing adverse effects drug studies effectiveness COVID-19. Yeah shit

_Glances America nervously seriously honors IP pandemic? Covid-19 pandemic one greatest challenges modern medicine ever faced. Doctors scientists scrambling find treatments drugs save lives infected people perhaps even prevent updated list 20 talked-about treatments coronavirus, including promising, interesting potentially harmful. also included warning F.D.A. fully licensed treatment specifically coronavirus, granted emergency use authorization current status vaccine development, see Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker. Oh look here's article Swedish strat supporters celebrating: like dumb idea me, ilk happy it. plenty others bother bookmark OBVIOUS Swedes returning Denmark.

NYC lots people chose to/ get hospital. Given united states implemented national strategy curb COVID, hope point effective vaccine. 2020-21 school year needs go online across country protect teachers, healthcare workers, grandma, grampa,.... Small differences like exactly many days infection allowed spread unmitigated large effect many infected. Like say Covid spreads rate cities, starts mitigation time, first infection New York three days earlier, infection might well double three days resulting twice many becoming infected end well.

Now think necessarily explains whole difference. similarities lots difference cities size, density health policies on.

My primary point exponentially developing phenomena, small, possibly random, initial differences big outcomes. *Salutes* Understood, Comrade! That‚Äôs Lab owners want believe...

Can't wait see idiots like Clay Travis spin this. already see something tomorrow like:

they speculate, unless launched sophisticated way getting data hospital/care center etc I'm even sure legal, doubt WH would data wouldnt publicly release anything beyond reported figures. im cautious, safe since february tbh. tried warning people, tried telling it, especially March, much falls deaf ears :(

Are masks silver bullet? masks supposed wear mitigate risk? enviroment base of? answer questions without treating like I'm horrible person simply asking you‚Äôve got medical condition prevents wearing mask, probably underlying issue makes susceptible covid, probably wear mask reduce socializing anyway.

We mask mandates one enforces them. people spit people asking put mask. really understand. America individualistic, people said ""I care me"". 
 
And couple fact we're also trying deal deep seated racial issues, administration intelligence cranky 4 year old.

I'd like everywhere would go mask mandate immediately, kind get it. limit freakouts non-compliance, want try that. never thought they'd eat *my* immune system! Sadly, lots disadvantaged developing world people die - many 1st hand experience climate change already. necessarily accept that. point is, want everyone fight bs here. Lives stake.

Hashtag Dawn Planet Atheists. ""fake news"" ""lies"" hits close home. Sadly seems way people learn.  antibodies confer protection, vaccine protective yet unidentified way basically wishful thinking.

Memory T-cells, stimulate antibody production. Patients exposed SARS-1 antibody levels drop long time ago, still showing robust T-cell levels, 17 years later.

The Moderna vaccine appear stimulate T-cell production. Wish could gild Canada! mean, broke quarantine act penalty $1M 3 years prison. So, actually got easy...

Dude probably true, fall circle jerk anecdotal evidence, plenty 3rd party evidence corroborating like airline bookings. number restaurants closing even areas resumed normal provided OpenTable May 26 show number seated diners restaurants nationwide 85% compared time last year.**

(golf clap) plus Kanye stunt we‚Äôre desperate attempts get voters way Trump knows how. Lies misdirection. mean visible washboard something see men's health magazine, see definition. I'd assume weight disparity comes frame something, large legs broad shoulders. Pittsburgh, people thought trees could go hundreds bars maskless. state reports figures publicly. unless Trump somehow suppresses states‚Äô rights publish factual statistical information (not saying FOXNews couldn‚Äôt spin somehow holy hell that‚Äôd really threading needle rope), still simple addition compare totals. Funny everyone sick Democrats choose vote mail would really easy destroy democratic process throwing mail votes away instead counting them. would need install corrupt head USPS giving bunch stolen taxpayer money.

I've sent studies prove efficacy them. wants see study people wear masks studied see often touch mask conclusion discussed pros vs cons.

Ain't truth. Remind state deaths highest deaths per capita? read article? belong here! harm mandate do? None. good could possibly do? Stop slow spread. Kemp ignorant, complete imbecile, lack intelligence downright dangerous. Yeah thats true, always remember treat others humans sure :(

But also understand *frustrating* people see issues could prevented simple act wearing mask. People scared cases, knowing sinking deeper irrecoverable crisis government won‚Äôt act people won‚Äôt take personal responsibilities seriously.

The people wear masks social distance bills pay, lives live want see families too. 

Imagine teacher goes ‚Äòwelp haha made whoopsie don‚Äôt care!‚Äô whole class stays even though unequivocally teachers fault listening clear instructions, whole class suffer due teacher recognising incompetence.

I would positively *seething* this, trust eroded away collective don‚Äôt goals, especially goal PROVEN help EVERYONE. Hence fucking CDC get ahead it. coronavirus already lot extremely promising candidates performing well clinical trials. think matter when, if. ISWYDT

source: Floridian Based CDC, around 1200 people die week Arizona time year. 7 days, 471 people died Covid.

Those good numbers, especially trend clearly going US charging us it. company develops decide badly gouge price. 

Sure, maybe majority Americans take it, many afford it, much unemployment, business closure, homelessness more? Come come Disney Great, we're talking number deaths certain period time here. I'm talking likelihood. likely get car crash die dying covid. healthy people probably now, showed symptoms virus already passed, like flu cold viruses go around time. ‚ÄúYo Dawg, heard wanted Karen.

Wait, say doctor? causes impotence too! specially people wearing masks?! Oh my! knows Ron DeSantis emboldened show everyone everything alright run November. think Russia would this? [This gonna fucking bloodbath showing 1413 right now. Maybe reported late night something scientists doctors discussion covid different BLM protest compared protest, injecting biases science? Scientists doctors opinions carry weight scientific medical matters. think BLM demonstration relevant covid. 

The concerns see raised scientists doctors mostly center around group settings can't wear masks can't social distance. hear saying shut every business country ability work home. hear saying shut beach bar 3 people ever use one time. see packed bar/restaurant/beach, seeing end result designed create. They're inherent gathering places people. They're designed draw crowds purpose. designated protest sites designed draw feel aggrieved massive crowds consistent basis.

Have heard reputable doctors scientists arguing mass protests people also forgo use masks COVID can't infect exercising right assemble? anything, asked safety concerns, use mask almost always recommended. straight condemned protests there's research indicating they've mass spreading events. places like New York City saw huge numbers protests yet they're spiking like rural places saw protests. Beaches, bars, restaraunts everywhere, people protesting not. 

You're asking scientists doctors give weight protests would anything else everything equal cause (or threat) spread virus. akin demanding give weight smoking exposure radon since cause lung cancer yet one much greater threat cause other. concerns expressed weighted equally. overeat consider healthy diet. Get food scale, track calories, look macro diet break down. get better idea calories in, make sure calories higher. M

Combine 30-60 minutes moderate exercise day days you‚Äôre set. question going require nuance. Please bear me.

Isn't covering mouth important part? models I've seen protecting others show dangerous mouth expelling virus particles. Meanwhile, nose built-in filters.

Also, uh, many people may already be, er, mouth-breathers. Filtering nose going help.

**Obviously** better get covered. get that. do. suspect covering mouth gets us benefit, work people wearing masks cover up. Murderer Let guess... he's Republican? help? recent study UK seems add complexity. remember, concluded obese patients fit are, too. found notable differences correlated levels fitness weight.

I‚Äôve said day 1 people saying ‚Äú can‚Äôt wear mask medical reasons‚Äù suffering anxiety panic attacks. ways deal issues able wear mask. burn them! wait pest disease get smoke somehow makes much worse cancelled trip see family. Truly devastating. TWiV 638, Dr. Griffen mentions hearing physicians told recovered COVID paitents return seeking treatment COVID like symptoms, given COVID tests beause prevailing medical wisdom reinfection impossible. implies may missing cases due doctors willing test recovered cases. 

I still working transcription here's saw several people New York area got sick COVID, went home, know thought oh win. know couple weeks later they'd come back they're super sick would die. know height pandemic way know: reinfection? somehow odd biphasic variant this? know describing sounds like potential reinfection, sounds like reinfection worse. Well obviously quite bit worse. mean initially mild COVID, cough sore throat, man way hospital. So, things worry about.

I think biphasic hypothesis also valid point, couple weeks long time something like AFAIK. clarify obvious, triple digit cases, close single digit deaths average.

And yeah, definitely countries would much worse tried Swedish strategy. bizarre msm dems (redundant) keep lie going.   seditionists point Misinformation misinformation matter topic. need get rid Mr Real DJ Last argument heard backdated deaths April May.

Which, so, even WORSE means CFR probably IFR higher thought, two months July deaths come they'll even higher. much winning!!! 

Trump promised us we'd tired winning, honestly say are. seeing cars plates US Calgary. showing signs vandalized (key marks paint one looked like paint remover smeared it). sight, mind.

He's scared trump. exactly. homemade mask (two absorbent layers one electrostatic) filter 40-80% viral particles depending fit material. reporting 90+% efficiency lab tests (such ones using AC filters). actually provide protection expect.

Whats important understand there's ""infection threshold"" beyond likely get virus. technically single COVID virus cause infection, realistically exposure 1000 particles unlikely it. Think like rolling dice, longer spend, higher roll avoid infection. someone virus coughs sneezes, they're spraying millions particles, breathe basically fucked, that's *actually* likely case spreading virus.

We've known COVID-19 spreads best asymptomatic/presymptomatic carriers, put much lower amounts virus. Breathing puts 20 particles per minute, speaking 50, singing yelling bit more. Since takes roughly 1000 particles become likely contract virus, even 40% effective mask increases amount time spend ""risky necessity"" areas like grocery store, doctor's office, etc without accumulating enough exposure pass threshold infection becomes likely.

This also important also observe social distancing shelter place. 20 PPM reaches infection threshold 50 minutes, good mask might double triple that, hanging friend who's asymptomatic, bar there's someone asymptomatic, likely pass threshold there. conversation (unknowingly infectious) cashier, safe distance, mask, mask distancing keeps exposure low. hope kiss mom nasty mouth.

People like Kemp, Trump, Desantis misguided ignorant, actively working destroy America, want blame liberals, BLM, immigrants it. 18 record set 2 days before. 31(26%) day week prior, also record time. Sure, places. addressing reporting. addressing upvoted false claim death 6 weeks diagnosis. ""But 2k deaths/day April/May, huge success, great success story. wont report that. People call ask kept deaths low. Another fauled leftist smear campaign. And, know, Obama, biden, woulsnt better.. stopped testing. stopped it. know well continue it. we'll successful.""

It sad try write something incoherent disjointed actual statements, still can't come close fence isnt turned on, one getting shocked. Life expectancy statistics, smoking rates, alcoholism rates, many health metrics, would indicate otherwise. Even TB still big thing everyone get checked every year. commenting bookmark place see numbers look 2-3 weeks. Deaths going biggest lagging indicator. Well you‚Äôre going wait couple weeks comment made study mentioning 3 months virus immunity antibodies produced. don‚Äôt know cells fit it‚Äôs speculation point. reminds much seatbelt law passed. downvoted using statistics? ü§î interested additional information. even read replies?

Protests parties... two weeks later, infections rise... two weeks that, deaths rise. funky shit positive rate? 11.2% low compared previous days case count, would imply Florida conducted 125,000 tests. surface looks like nugget positive information Florida, can't figure make ballots neutral. horrible weird good RIP.

I recently read article, majority concerns stem from: [COVID Vaccine already lied public masks admitted it. anyone else complicit lying masks honestly medical licenses revoked. Althing experts? Icelandic parliament? First all, Fox News removed COVID tracker website clearly coordinating WH. Secondly, CDC longer receiving COVID numbers primary health organization removed. Thirdly, GOP governors hotspot states gladly suppress and/or remove numbers public already low level. Yes, way Swede Looks like new talking point moving fatality rate! They're playing Russian roulette keep adding bullets successful click. Huh, context circumstance matters. Imagine that. Well guess virus going spread like wildfire large outdoor gathering. sad usefulness people society depends ability work. Nevermind people later life gave entire lives economy already. apparently get covid die, lawls. 

Ok that's depressing. I'll see out. results phase 1 released Monday Lancet medical journal.

Phase 1 data obviously going good bad, wouldnt even done phase 2 phase 3. Actually sounds like Trump suggestion. already moved labs faking make every test positive test there's many cases Well that's partially true. party propaganda networks tell idiots want hear run it.  new record hospitalizations 491. Never big fan, remember couple great bits him. Sad see fart effects used ""Swedish people need rules disorderly crowd like underdeveloped european."" past years, known Republican party many things actually make sense? Yeah position exactly. whole fuck mentality good thing. there's real life situation actually need listen experts actually need give little personal liberty backfires massively. Need cap stimulus 70% something. retroactive. Pretty simple pull AGI individual, checks sent, etc. little math. advisors probably told 180 covid would greatly help reelection chances. say wrong, ask everyone wear mask, set nationwide guidelines. It‚Äôs politically good idea would save lives.

There would constant roving patrols watching people take they're inside. 

Employees want fight people.  election think America accepted Trump, much complacent happen. People felt okay voting Clinton voting us thought chance Trump could win. (I citizen then, vote. knew many people voted not-Clinton, since confident would win anyway could vote conscience.) honestly see triumph complacency. 

My hope people's eyes open now, course correct. voting Biden, even though 4th choice Democratic candidate. Wait phase III data getting hopes ok needed laugh, thanks says actually true. doctors didnt falsify anything. lot cases impossible immediately tell cause death exactly was. Imagine overcrowded hospital lots people dying every day hospital max capasity. think doctors going waste valuabel time finding exactly cause death was? Also lot cases isnt single cause mixture problems lead death. Italy lot countries count Covid 19 positive tests. labeled nobody falsifying anything, aware it. counted deaths always rough approximation actual number close excess mortality calculated hindsight though. Doesnt matter anyway person addressed cant read Says man removed episode explaining two genders ""science"" discovered 70 new ones? Real question?

Like vaccines, study study confirms efficacy safety, development built backbone inquiry bright individuals dating back Jonas Saulk. 'trust' vaccines legitimate claim, side effects within acceptable parameters (not cause autism, relationship shown match statistically verifiable model causality multiple, independent labs researchers), one go read papers check numbers choose. This, think, key reestablishing form dialog American people role scientific inquiry plays explaining predicting world around us. Absolutely not. It‚Äôs funny rules clear avoiding politics.

Beyond that, strategy vaccines make everyone immune. vaccine 100% effective anyway. work large percentage population becomes immune *more less time*. drives R(t) suddenly way 1, short time pandemic levels managed contact tracing quarantine. time, effectively gone. good vaccine easily maintain immunity long enough that, whether boosted eventually.

Full paper: opinion piece, backed evidence review article: ""There clear cases COVID-19 fomite transmission found literature. "" go describe possible cases, nothing surface definitely culprit. Now, surface lead transmission really hard track, reasonably common, seen least one confirmed case now. also couple hospital researches swabbed surface around positive patients, found viral material, failed grow viable virus lab. 

The flip side course cases caused surfaces vast majority cases must caused direct person person transmission, i.e. inhaling people's droplets.

Thank friend putting people risk. Fauci definitely helped save ton lives, he's high-profile well respected lot non-Americans taking advice seriously. punishment violating mask health guidelines community service hospital. misspelled ""harassing him"". White House publicly vilifies him, attempts limit ability work along COVID-19 task force, attempts shred credibility frequently ignores advice passed he's impeded? No, Master's Public Health Probably best say last goodbyes them. Unfortunately number gonna go high, huge population high density.

Literally biggest item Trump's agenda. Jesus Christ think police/emt/fire scanner traffic fake too? live Florida every single day nightmare.  What's worse government response leadership this? certainly helps...this ridiculous free-for-all hodge podge approach mask wearing (by leaving selective optional, private sector) nowhere near need right now. reading losing antibodies necessarily mean losing immunity least second infection severe. Also vaccine still make huge difference? 60% population immune even 3 months, would shrink hell viral spread make much easier control right? Utahn here. state government extremely poor job handling this. (No surprise). governor concerned still pushing schools church‚Äôs open without wear masks. don‚Äôt show news much population smaller full blown shit show here. number people serious cases rains constant, going radar. turned actually 5 times many people infected, developing symptoms even smaller percentage. 60 million 1.3 billion. that's ""worst case"" meaning might come true. That's actually bad considering situation. benefit lockdown stops knucklehead employers non-essential businesses forcing employees risk health go work. qualify unemployment benefits told go work show safe.

looking you, mickey mouse. honestly thought nationwide rule time. Everything makes sense look weight loss looking at..6kg. 13 lbs. I‚Äôm scratching head obese person losing 13 lbs level caloric intake 24 weeks (somebody lying food). It‚Äôs 0.5 lbs/week. Someone BMI 30 losing lot closer double 24 weeks.

Er, people machines: they're people. Losing weight exact science. One calories listed food packaging approximations, two people differences metabolic efficiencies, stress, lack sleep, etc, inhibit weight going living virus long time. best thing whatever improve health then. Yes, takes time lose weight. But, important thing take away it‚Äôs nothing situation. Maybe takes year get obesity, doesn‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt make meaningful positive impacts life lessening chances severe complications go journey.

Okay, beautiful sentiment contrary anything said. Reddit's culture towards weight fucking bonkers making statement aligning medical professional (and also common sense) says ""Don't crash diet, expect making significant reduction weight short period time going make healthy"" met anger, hand-wringing, moral pleas.

Is worldwide effort eradicate virus already ongoing? would different? Yes, somehow wearing face mask 8 hours day minimum since March yet I‚Äôm dead brain damaged yet. Agree others though, good luck getting point across convinced going suffocate mask (yet probably problem putting booze, Cheetos, nicotine knows else bodies). That‚Äôs people Northeast still wearing masks everywhere public now. 

Northeast got slammed migration virus internationally infected Europe flew New York Boston airports, there‚Äôs excuses states months prepare states made huge sacrifice didnt. CDC. WHO. Brazil weeks now.  You‚Äôll never know don‚Äôt try. need shutdown people smart enough wear masks. What?  Florida massively counting covid mean Flordia handling hiding covid deaths better I'll agree that.

From January - June 2020 8671 deaths predicted.

But time period 3650 deaths attributed covid-19.

So caused extra 5000 deaths? anyone actually Miami anywhere bad?

Are bars etc open normal? anyone wearing masks? fuck going state oh lord even know point trying prove more? nothing we're talking about.

You asked prove Galileo era technology, told you. Seeing sun proof anything. You‚Äôre trying argue reason, person you‚Äôre arguing didn‚Äôt use reason get viewpoint. 

I‚Äôve actually Americans tell ‚Äòwell I‚Äôve never wanted leave country anyway‚Äô faced travel restrictions. symptom years public school funding reductions. funny people became biological threats. Mine too. one place people without masks waiting outside group shopped. impressed.

J.P. Morgan Chase financial data. turns single biggest predictor outbreak food spending. in-restaurant dining spending rises , outbreaks follow.  spending shifts grocery spending, outbreaks wane. would way go? Vaccinations correct way go, way go. 

A worldwide effort eradicate virus.

That might sound crazy, 5 months ago sounded crazy. idiot Florida need removed office immediately. danger people state country. took walmart work 2 days get everything set social distancing started. target sucks lol Nah. shitty experiment. think seems perfectly sane him. views predominant communities color lower income sacrifice ‚Äúsave economy.‚Äù echo chamber intentional anti-science rhetoric runs rampant south rural voters keep electing awful people. truth he‚Äôs actually modest person. It‚Äôs true! Australian schools back, every time one kid tests positive, entire school shut two weeks. think science wrong. think colossally wrong. also think anything science Sorry higher kite writing you. Assuming exponential growth states right now, hitting 20% across nation. theories hitting 20% could effectively slow movement virus. positive note this. Here‚Äôs is: racial/ethnic minorities likely contract virus white people. nothing genetics, it‚Äôs race/ethnicity correlated poverty, poorer people likely get die virus.

Kemp‚Äôs best bet winning Georgia suppress black Atlanta vote. Secretary State Georgia, purging people voter rolls. (Sec State state charge elections.)

Atlanta mask ordinance. Get rid mask ordinance, black people get sick die. Old black people, ones remember Civil Rights Movement, active voters. die faster old white people suburbs, that‚Äôs good GOP election chances. need teach basics future. make fire.

Especially parent... kids could get jail free cards, high positions multi national corporations earn, set life die? see values morals tale old time. 

So get it. example globe politics intertwined guarantees personal wealth power? way people actually interested governing, legislating, judging, enforcing stepping plate? Holy Shit... need 2 months. Start over. Educational videos u must watch in-order get next stimulus check. campaign wear mask lead celebrities political sides. think they're playing ear. Realistically there's way effectively considering cost time takes get results. thing would shut everything someone comes positive, long term solution

Don't get wrong, still wear mask need, open bottom get fresh breathe in. Looking thumbnail I'm surprised see kids wearing mask. lot stupid fucking parents make kids age 6 7 run amok without mask
Don't know heck logic I'm surprised conscientious people northern jersey are. They're alright! They'll find another talking point downplay situation.

I guarantee it. Kobe‚Äôs death feels like years ago Injecting disinfectant body? light? feels like state-sanctioned extermination... vaccines developed, I'm confident Oxford vaccine. choice, eventually released safe public, want one. Yeah, spot on, country run multiple people, Boris one. idea country entirely rests whim one man extremely naive lot Karen's refuse take vaccine. agree 1000% sadly, way monetize pandemic, lot companies, let alone countries, find way so.

Given shit show world, you‚Äôd think greater good would take precedence... like dinner something meal there's awkward conversation finally one person makes first move signals everybody get feel weird it. everybody thinks ""oh thank god"" everybody gets leave  Wait, started 2020?

(You're seriously right though, sane people left US need look cause leaders sadly.) Yes, know, mean immunity, memory cell last decades. body learn fight virus make antibody upon reinfection. now? ""Critically, researchers note social distancing policy whole-of-government approach could successful without implementation wide-spread testing, contact tracing isolation found infected."" Russia confident would vaccine soon background players vaccine race. 

They trying steal it. try works everyone buys it. unfortunately loud vocal minority community members (parents, students, even teachers administrators) district think stupid hoax fight mask distance mandates 'make personal point.' risks everyone else anyway. Super selfish. Obviously **confirmed** cases first peak NYC... good rule thumb % positive test correlates actual tests?

I've become numb large numbers kinda writing huge numbers coming ""oh well past day find them"", point say likely cases days first surge? right somehow turned evil Dr. Fauci anyway. applaud dude staying serene. like gray-rocking massive scale. Wrong? Lol ya go. Chew actually.

You don‚Äôt even understand article referencing. Well need sources joy life! Glad found something yes, go clean room think you‚Äôre arguing semantics closed system ideal system mathematical model, broader definition universe know it. 

If system important input defines important output, I‚Äôm going say body open system also absorb radiation energy energy form temperature.

So you‚Äôre really nerding hard concept people fundamentally still using correctly. It‚Äôs interesting got downvoted this. Reading comment seems pretty likely right. 300,000 Americans drop dead COVID, CDC isn‚Äôt given data, anyone know it? lied. concerning. could told public truth. Leave face mask medical profs, use t-shirt.

He reason people wearing mask. said mask work. lie. Thats odd.. facebook instagram feed FULL pregnancy announcements. Majority due December - February  always get chuckle hear dumb trump support say something like, ""Ohh well, Billy Nye says must true"" sarcastic dismissive way, trump says something say exact thing truly believe trump...theyre fucking stupid Cooperation? People losing shit asked wear mask? People understanding slurpee good enough reason go local 7-11.  

Oh, leaders respective governments cooperating recalled, dealt expeditiously.  would help. use resources make vaccine, steal information make it. Yeah contained done right? Never mind numbers last 10 days. Don‚Äôt look them. Yep. tell trump supporting dad slowly waning support him, still won‚Äôt ever fully admit wrong supporting him. teachers least (unpaid) month, better 12 hours lead time got last term, least. Lol yeah think could get behind lowercase A. Definitely going need see second C though Humanity already extinct. want accept that. respond Covid, already lost climate change wars. already see it. Massive unusually high temperatures winter, people say normal. I'm talking 70 degree days 30s February. 

Shit winter first time life ever remember snow. Maybe flurries. every year we've least one two major storms. expect next year even worse. good  Old news. sounded like signed up, line slow, left system glitch sent result. conspiracy, florida. Either way, it‚Äôs hearsay one dude. also, kids much prone asymptomatic get caught screening methods schools recommending

In person schooling disaster places


There's possible way in-person learning safely point areas country. Especially given fractured ""leadership"" display right levels Put bullet proof vest on. I‚Äôve found one result ‚ÄúRichard Rose‚Äù sub it‚Äôs 5 days old.

From reading headline kinda blends several people nationwide (US) denied COVID, died.

Which, damn, that‚Äôs sad sentence write. generic talk show host mold cannot tired. I'd rather home, tbh. Literally one isn‚Äôt institutional failure government it‚Äôs one mom group morons. Private sector still complete garbage nothing humanity mind profits. [nah dont respect talking saving freedom, fuckers dont realize movie theaters open korea, aint gonna like us another year thanks assholes Hopefully, doesn‚Äôt continue follow straight like cases. weeks average age infection dropped 30s wouldn‚Äôt expect curve grow much them. 

I could see going up, leveling weeks start go lot current infections counted. Looking individually options, they're incredibly inequitable.

If afford something like one parent drop half time quit. job flexibility let work hours. extra computer afford educational programs. afford hire new education grad come tutor. 

If well off, big apartment, single parent? That's fucked. matter hard try, kid likely going fall behind peers never, ever catch up. Makes wonder many *did* higher BMI diabetes diagnosis caused lose little weight... enough.

My mentally ill sister topped 400 lbs ended diabetic coma 20s. years daily injections slowly lost weight due structured environment group home. fifties, hovers around BMI 30 take metformin (alongside schizophrenia meds) keep blood sugar control.  think heading could simply been, ""There Literally Good Options Fall.""

If things continue have, also exclude last two words. commenter using new account nearly exclusively posts sub, well number conspiracy subs like lockdown_skepticism. They're obviously muddy waters. paper measures taken, truth second ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù really much CA. There‚Äôs shift people‚Äôs attitudes lately. Sounds like it... CDC: 

‚ÄúBMI used population assessment overweight obesity. calculation requires height weight, inexpensive easy use clinicians general public. BMI used screening tool body fatness diagnostic.‚Äù

If you‚Äôre releasing study relationship obesity Covid maybe actually use accurate measurement instead cheapest expedient one study April. 

And point isn‚Äôt athletes misrepresented, point generally people are. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2‚Äù weigh 210 running sub 20 minute 5K. exactly overweight according BMI am. I‚Äôm working constantly elite athlete stretch basis BMI incredibly flawed something used study like this. dont believe explain symptoms reason got tested? lmao saying unironically sheriffs eastern washington including current hotspot yakima anti maskers crusading """"""""freedom"""""""" Muh Freedums! find hilarious I‚Äôm arguing? News me. scary thing people area don‚Äôt really believe died Covid. think died something else Covid. That's sad statement American intellect want celebrities instead scientists tell people wear masks.

That said, right. probably need professional wrestlers reality TV stars this, speaking slowly using words appeared one Trump tweets. Ok. give up. Let's start civil war....I'm ready. Idk places aren‚Äôt renting cops weeks. around original lockdown prevent looting fights, I‚Äôm sticks Wait, think there's additional energy human body absorbing besides food/drink consume? 

A better way describe CICO Calories Consumed = Calories Stored + Calories Utilized. Ultimately, calories utilized less calories consumed, remainder stored. utilize consumed, reduce storage make difference. 

Hyperthyroidism account utilizing less calories, shows sluggishness rest/sleep needed. Desperate times call stupid measures. Dude open verified Twitter account start dumping statistics. live Indiana, roomates work chick-Fil-a someone kitchen positive COVID. got super sick got tested CVS 3rd. 13 days later still results test, numbers call put long wait nobody answering 3 hours. numbers way lower really be, everyone sick, wearing masks! left tested would probably hard time getting number Florida going guinea pig gives us data point R0 ratio infections confirmed positive tests large population.

Based fact they're close 1.5% population confirmed positive even started slowing down, seems like start ruling optimistic estimates unfortunately. Yeah, nobody listened advice makes fucking livid STORES, governing body that‚Äôs meant help keep us safe, ones forced try keep people safe... Like 7-fold increase pneumonia deaths year? either till read whole list. NIH HHS least makes level sense Truth. I‚Äôve lost 8 lbs since March cutting carbs fuck? blatant lie. Anyone making think 80k didn‚Äôt get stimulus check. taxes filed previous year. 
HOW FUCKING STUPID PEOPLE SICK RACE WAR BS It‚Äôs new reality though. exist coronavirus. It‚Äôs also strictly US issue. remember watching Super Bowl without worry. remember going eat family 10 days everything started shutting down. daughter talking Anime convention coming April remember telling would go her... long still happens. 

Everything else year blur. loved one morbidly obese says understand overweight eat much. point dinner go sit couch consume spoonful spoonful Nutella straight jar -- get mad tell shut hell up. country straight full-on denial mode anyone tries show different bite head off, like rabid dog. Throughout life experienced stigmatized perfectly healthy weight, neither overweight. easy gang minority. sick hearing endless senseless parroting ""fat stigma fat shaming"". Ain't damn thing majority!!! funny reporter saying violates ethics law. Unless Trump office senate GOP somehow ""epiphany"", violate laws want, nothing happen. treason charges him, Trump, rest things happen. Maybe virus magically go away vanish one day. yes also outliers die 2 days let‚Äôs worry outliers lol ever thought, right? would require accountability. Something which, seen past 4 years hell even beyond, happen. tragic. meanwhile others still running around waving guns calling hoax. 3.5 years, I‚Äôve learned Trump always get away *attempting* suppress information, Trump‚Äôs track record suppressing information *should* able suppress (the endless leaks within even cabinet) poor. 
Add number fronts information released on, sheer importance information, literal millions billions eyes worldwide every day makes another beast entirely. Resigned ‚Äúenjoy numbers last‚Äù comments aren‚Äôt helpful. ‚Äúboth sides‚Äùability claiming everything hyperbole lead us away reality-based, rational discussion. we‚Äôre yelling opinions no-mans-land reality, we‚Äôre playing right Trump‚Äôs hands. feeds on. Fear Trump‚Äôs wrath Yes ""most"" opinion also true neither vaccines released phase 2 data showing effectiveness. Ehh, Germany first patients January Munich strict medical surveillance Robert-Koch-Institute already observing noteable decline antibodies within early patients; prompting fears may immune current string Virus 2-3 years (no research done yet things like T-cells etc. though, might look brighter there). 

If turns case, even vaccine gonna cover safety short term, vaccination might become even annual, like flu. refer doctors statements congress oath congress anonymous sources media hacks dems. (redundant).

But lets take point.  according article Potus said ""Trump said week valued Fauci‚Äôs input always agree him. ""    
OH,,,, MYYYY GAWD....THAT VILIFICATION........  horrible potus always agree.  therefore,, NEVER agrees.   

it's bunch shit msm dems intent stirring disgusting. hey,, potus making political..  smdh.. It‚Äôs needed point many citizens dying virus asking question ""What American children need successful adults? "". concerned country's default answer (virtual learning) described using words ""disaster"" ""useless"".

If going wait vaccine, extend summer break another 6 months repeat grade year.

If going accept new normal invest make successful.

Right bad hybrid.... making look like trying, zero investment, much success. Yeah, hindsight it‚Äôs glaringly obvious peak April largely localized hotspot Northeast due infected Europeans making international travel connections Boston New York. 

Then got complacent Northeast death totals got control, meanwhile exponential growth slowly silently spreading across communities states. Next couple months going rough ride. Obama went pandemic would also lose reelection. Unless handled absolutely perfectly course. Trump done even voter suppression usual level. However concern, go extreme win. Yes. 5 10 years deaths recognized were, COVID19 deaths. logic bad. Yesterday's reported deaths March. March irrelevant.

Say likely deaths occurred week ago, reported yesterday. One week ago Florida 8,935 cases. Yesterday 13,965 cases. ability treat virus increased substantially last week. number cases increasing, Monday come kinda miracle cure, assume number deaths *actually* happened yesterday greater number happened week ago. fact, surprising least 150 people died every day last week.

Florida's fire. Yeah, China's response, covid would essentially eliminated first lockdown March made everyone stay fuck home April. actually welcome form martial law meant staying inside 4 weeks. virus gone. Ohhhh.

I see logic handle covid-19 information better CDC floors me. also likely infected before, say past flu season oddly enough believe worse usual could initial infections covid, reinfection possible. would think viral load made enough difference way nurses doctors dying? 2020s might become ""lost decade"", next several years recovering get back 2019 levels. There's already estimates countries might recover fully 2024, really 2nd wave yet. Governor impeached? disagree man's views still mock dead. 

Part sure feels ""haha face stupid anti masker, took hospital space someone actually distanced wore mask..."" stop life still life, bozos office, internet trolls uneducated people can't seem think ask question ""Why?"" prefer type 1 type 2 error case that's people cannot rationalize this. headline inflammatory helpful. progressive, hate non-issues used try spark outrage. Headlines like takes eye legitimate problems system. issue making internet access available encouraging compliance tax laws financial literacy.  Personal responsibility helps, too. 

I make litany criticisms inequality American system, headline divisive fiction. implies cause effect relationship that's simply there. here. Winter far better summer. agree. Initially massive fallout tbh continue be, however seeing pattern jobs returning. mass riots violence 2007-2009 recession? That‚Äôs sentiment don‚Äôt understand. things happened continue happen. It‚Äôs people encore violence anytime something goes wrong. make sure remind target always required wear shoes, shirt, pants coming store never complained that... wish talking context too. death numbers go up, prepared change opinion?

(Also, google US's rate see already going up). government reported. Spain, 5000 cases confirmed last 7 days. Yeah, Florida (and Texas, idk states) huge spike pneumonia deaths happen perfectly coincide similar spikes COVID (a disease leads taxing pneumonia lot hospitalized cases) deaths. would spend time hiking would bring food + get takeout go... still discussing it. go Colorado several times year miss much. unique characters Americans make country great certain situations.

How figure? feel like lucked colonizing landmass enormous amounts untapped resources consequently amassed ton wealth exploiting races people committing genocide others. can't immediately think legitimately great things we've accomplished due 'unique characters Americans' hypothetically accomplished elsewhere. Hey link info chance? That‚Äôs terrifying true. Nah, Putin‚Äôs gonna ship russian vaccine america fuck us up. cyrillic script vials. imported russian vaccine distributed centralized federal stockpile overseen kushner. exacerbate anti-vaxx divide country. allow virus drag on. One ‚Äúperks‚Äù country enjoy thanks donnie‚Äôs submissive relationship putin. 

Am fear mongering? Look around you, wouldnt happen? fact, likely putin offer donnie phone, donnie publicly say getting russian vax, nobody want it, weeks head-scratching, kushner finally come idea packaging vaccine identical way safer competitors, still get paaaaiiiiidddddd, son! Dont tell rules oversight would prevent this. Ill wait till see many hospitals transparent public yesterday‚Äôs public coup CDC. whole post purely political. Remove it.  likely direct deposit set-up IRS? try create racial tension due differences people filed. really think IRS lumped people race categories sent minority ones later? understand. Believe me, do! Yup, ""low death rate"" mention shoots lungs third people needed hospitalized, long term affects anybody still completely unable known due simple lack time passed. 

Afaik infected people could turn zombie know two yrs (hyperbole), yet people still run around ""if get it, get it"" mentality giving fuck, pesky eldery seem die (which alos true shows severe lack empathy). *""If communist dictators it, USA?""*

Jesus. worth talking this. going get individual cooperation governments around world, taskforce ""recall expeditiously deal with"" world leaders. 

You're outlining fantasy. worth continuing. irrelevant - nation prepared March onslaught. States prepared better capabilities preventing COVID deaths.

The problem looking purely cases context cases themselves. many asymptomatic? many mild? many severe? last week 8,000 cases 1,000 severe requiring hospitalization, compared 10,000 yesterday 100 severe, make pretty decent inference last week's cases likely result deaths.

But information really hand, I'll semi-agree huge chance getting worse death perspective, data available make concrete claim. Atlanta declare district. options given yet. vague response district consider people's unique situations. said how. Someone else telling could FMLA yearly leave year. understand would unpaid I'm even sure works yet. know 12 weeks FMLA pregnant women give birth. 

 true world revolve around teachers. also consider students course. society pushes forward really fast without considering teachers repercussions.  Many us quit. Subs turn up. younger people choose professions start seeing teachers dying news. :/

My prediction... taxes money direct deposited last year got taxes first. Many people poorer communities didn‚Äôt direct deposit used H&amp;R Block like services get debit card loaded refund necessary attached bank account. much issue. 130,000 tests done UK yesterday 642 positive 0.5%. even think well European countries either. Oh boy....look cares act...google advice situation &amp; wouldnt go worked w/her recently. Err safe side, adamant. get fired many states reason, WRONG reason &amp; would high WRONG reason list. Stay home, find agencies could threaten tactfully report too. risk loved ones!!! well~ Thanks! sure shit deserve lot respect veterans.

The US war unnecessary shitstorm since 40s. WWII vets get respect, many left point. last 6 months, we've gotten multiple vaccines phase 3 trials. gone nothing like search vax HIV. 

Your comparison flu vaccine even facts, annual ""hope works"" vaccine due rapid mutation influenza beign observed SARS-CoV-2. 

You're still right given one vax's we've already developed proven effective CoV-2 suitable mass innoculation. good mix caution optimism, reasons pessimistic disappearing almost quickly reasons refuse wear mask. Nobody seems know word epicenter means world. live Spain. Masks mandatory closed spaces outdoors can't socially distance(though people wearing outdoors too.)  think I'm concerned message keeping distance others seems lost lot significance. Masks help, staying 6ft away people! 

In UK, message still remains stay 2m away others, live seems mostly still adhered to. Whenever hear US, everyone talks masks much keeping distance others.

I heard suggestions fomite transmission may less significant originally thought that's absolutely confirmed makes sense keep washing hands, keep distance, wear face coverings can't stay apart others - three, one! state fair share skewing numbers too. one, persons residence outside state(like LOT people come Florida). counted Florida death. Despite contracting virus dying here. gets attributes home state. possibility though? something concerned sure, state reporters publicly information still there, official record that's iffy. still able see truth time being. I'm saying big deal, absolutely is! appropriately concerned.   you, people, killed hundreds others. thankful essential workers whining wearing masks failing social distance. blood hands, call Christians. Hell waits you. troll who's highly active conspiracy misinformation subs. Stop coming actual subreddits trying mislead distract conversation flimsy vague attempts cast doubt scientific reality. Sweden success story west. Sure successful Asian countries west, is. lockdown yet still managed bend curve deaths decreasing drastically now. Less death per capita compared Spain well. Great job overall. least used method suits western culture more: forcing people anything rely people care themselves. knew months ago could done something ""Just lose weight"" indeed stupid thing say. People get fat first place losing weight easy.

Turns actually *simple* (expend energy consume), easy all, fighting instincts biology every step way. 

I lost 95 lbs one point, gained 10 back, decided try different approach. Instead trying get skinny (since plateaued regained) decided try get strong.  Sure, squats suck donkey balls, least stopped regaining weight despite eating even calories before. ^((So much protein.... oh god.... much protein....)) Nope, fuck that. Opinions inherently deserve respect, least opinions lead actions kill people. Fuck people don‚Äôt wear masks. Suppression goal countries, eradication. eradication strategy, would lock contact trace zero known active cases, allow visitors without tested.

Fwiw, dont think worldwide eradication possible... least yet.

Accountable what? go divisions. Like clockwork. Oh yeah 67 cases day Hong Kong. Surely pass Florida moment! Capitalism comes different stages flavors generally speaking allow much democracy needs to. Capitalism great early stages competition innovation stage often thought proponents capitalism.

In later stages looks like corporate socialism. government used subsidize companies rather provide common defense, general welfare etc. stage kinda sucks everyone isnt already winning. also stage often thought people criticizing capitalism. Companies become anti competitive, stagnate, charge less. get involved government control regulations socialize losses. 

It's interesting used Cuba touchstone failed socialism. argue Cuba socialism trade embargoes economic sanctions. plenty democracies strong social programs collapsed Mad Max nightmare. virus going indefinite time being, stores frankly look like fools backtrack new mask rules/enforcement way. Best way prepare suppose in-house. Sadly, me. think actually live see daily basis especially nurses. Oh really? heard that. wonder changed. Neat! OH troll. sorry. Peaches don‚Äôt come Georgia. come can. Check Arizona's case/death charts: looking good, matter gets spun. assume that, big legs. could also stand lose fat, couldn't. fuck still doctors infected?

Medford Freddy's maybe 50%. china can. dont see reason others can't. Besides lack will.

Short version: u.s. freedom club needs get itself. people too. bunch liberal friends Democrats hanging other's houses apartments (age 25-41). young folks liked Bernie too. shock independent always vote blue choose lesser two evils time. Democrat friends got Trump train well way worse this. uhhhhhh....

Except machines medical conditions typically impact hunger, metabolic functions. impact minimal amount calories. conditions cause person gain weight maintain caloric deficit person‚Äôs deficit different. Additionally, number people know who‚Äôve starved likely never starved simply felt hunger. Starvation real issue obese. 

Why people arguing internet? inadvertently pushing narrative says people control weight, are. far removed healthy weight normal portions look like, seems insane, capacity change.

Somehow science become politicized... people trust science left uses science facts more, therefore right trust it. people sedentary throughout world exercise coming daily tasks. It‚Äôs easy, cheap, effective people planet. 

But congrats running quickly. people can‚Äôt people don‚Äôt. Here's latest list states counties, ranked per capita deaths: Spoiler: HCQ

Edit: still sucks though government 100% blood hands Best part make write 500 times ‚ÄúA mask worn‚Äù Bart Simpson style. Better yet, look pictures 50s go vintage clothing store.

Actually many people lose sense smell also lose sexual desire, wonder related that? American friend saw broadcast sent me. interesting even US national news running segments situation. Many people Sweden satisfied country's lockdown-lite coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, others unhappy region saw one worst COVID-19 mortality rates world. Elizabeth Palmer reports.

Some outtakes video:

* ‚ÄúA trip Stockholm‚Äôs subway like time travel back pre-covid world.‚Äù Says reproter goes say ‚ÄúI stick like sore thumb, I‚Äôm one wearing mask‚Äù. 

* ‚ÄòSweden per capita one worst COVID mortality totals world, 30% higher US. 

* Epidemiologist Nella Brussalar [sp?] says one country Europe second peak Sweden. 

That last point facepalm. least Nordics say expecting large second wave, rather small localized cluster outbreaks, compared many Swedish experts predicted second wave Sweden could cards. regret one upvote give.

Even terms distribution things extremely promising, unlike regular vaccines one doesn‚Äôt need frozen stored chilled. AstraZeneca also agreed distribute nonprofit multiple governments throwing unprecedented amounts money so. thing left determine efficacy, doesn‚Äôt even need 100% preventative highly effective stopping outbreak. SARS-CoV-2 slowly mutating virus hopefully also effective long term Go earn social points somewhere else Florida Walmart exactly 3 weeks ago. employees wearing masks, 9/10 noses...and saw less three customers fucking shoeless. Everyone looked like fucking idiot wearing mask. sorry hear hope fully recover. However, experience norm all. Im saying arent risks are. also cant live scared understand sometimes life happens.

Sucks, happens.  unemployment fell May June, jobless rate number unemployed 7.6 percentage points 12.0 million ""As July 16, four states ‚Äî Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Vermont ‚Äî met four five goals, demonstrates strong progress."" That's weird... come every time vaccine update gets tagged good news upvoted top subreddit... sounds like really hate yeah? tell cell meant weren‚Äôt following 1000-1600 calorie day diet obese lost 13 lbs 24 weeks. like 1600-2000 day diet amount weight loss. diet may set former, actuals lot closer latter. 

Saying doesn‚Äôt matter lose portion weight you‚Äôre screwed going screwed long time regardless (Which *is* said) isn‚Äôt correct. Based available medical research, losing even modest amounts weight obese helps. I‚Äôm mad I'm skeptical patients obesity, 52 percent respiratory failure, 36 percent admitted ICU, quarter needed ventilator breathe, 30 percent died within 30 days symptoms first appearing. 

 CDC provided data update May 2017 stating adults 20 years older, crude obesity rate 39.8% age adjusted rate measured 39.7%. Including obese, 71.6% American adults age 20 overweight.[Source [Source mortality rate virus currently hovering around 3.8% [Source study references Mild Obesity BMI 30, would close 40% Americans. awhile since took stats class, 40% Americans mortality rate 30% would seeing death rate closer 12%, rather current 3.8.

Folks careful follow CDC guidelines, think research needed here. virus primarily affects urban areas vote Democrat. raging pandemic November would make even easier rig election (pull polling centers virus ""hot spots"" happen Dem counties)

And else fails there's Trump crony head USPS slow mail-in ballots left-leaning areas. ballots need delayed days void vote, all. Easily solved cutting staff certain areas ""due pandemic"".

The end game steal election cost, honestly seems working. least manageable universal face masks leaders cared health people nearly much care health stock portfolios, would able protect teachers instead asking risk Instead, leaders view children nothing tiny impediments efficient wage slavery. Health Human Services Secretary Alex Azar put bluntly: ‚ÄúParents get back factory. They‚Äôve got get back job site. get back office. part kids, knowing kids taken care of.‚Äù

This tell cell comment history place can't tell. small segment country referring to? ^(maybe try spend time backyard can't go outside exercise? little cases i'm canada parents healthcare super paranoid go grocery shopping every 2 weeks. lot stuff get frozen reduce need go often. everything sanitized entering house. maybe go store opens minimize interaction people? stay safe) clinical reports re-infection occurring 3 months. think people think 6 month reinfection happening

Most people continually wrong virus. many people, sadly. Pretty horrifying go public lol heads up, studies yet peer reviewed, like lot studies appeared early weeks may turn untrue.

My question would be, given three months on, heard lot people catching twice. Mitch McConnell supposedly active planning moving Cameron's career along.

McConnell likely grooming successor. knows there's possibility majority leader 2020 One ur anti mask subs mean, duh, fundie evangelical god would finally happy miracle everything back normal...at least apocalypse finally starts. /s Smart man! is, opinion, high chance occurs. One thing note chance go ways. 

While cuts upside, strongly believe rule investing afford lose. It‚Äôs easy picture upside, many shades breaking even 0 hurt bad.

Going long index fund basically means think economy grow, tends that. idea keep holding however long takes hit bull market. 

This could early q2 next year late 2022-2025. Imo would keep mortgage paying time, fast slow. Prepaying delaying payments hurt credit profile. It‚Äôs shitty system, lenders don‚Äôt like fast prepays usually.

As 2020 shown us, there‚Äôs lot volatility pop nowhere. could awhile pays off. food thought. Oh, suggesting learn people‚Äôs experience? /s
Seriously, agree you. Distance learning even novel idea. schools really using time figure worked didn‚Äôt others. miss last months CA already case? 26 pounds 18 go. 

Nothing like threat imminent death motivation.  regards resistance, penalty society take attitude letting people don‚Äôt want vaccine? Retail work hell pandemic. many people entitled downright insufferable. can't imagine retail worker now. one stores getting paid enough enforce policy. must standing close windmills... currently highest death toll per capita rolling 7 day average Europe.

It economy bad worse neighbors.

The latest forecasts Sweden one least affected European Countries. Maybe use month old even ""highest burden infection"" mean. say link. guessing steep increase. medical sector learned much virus since March.

The country second wave like US creating right Iran. Look curve daily deaths below, second wave much less steep. guy like backtracking. Period. He's pissed son something still can't rationalize ""no big deal"". hah I'd assumed data number people tested positive first test divided number tests people who'd never tested before... wups. reason get illness. Still think method ""equitable"" population control. Disease targets considered drains social systems/resources (the old, sick, homeless, poor), looks though could target percentage men infertility, one study control global consideration time. Methods selective birthers, forced sterilization, one child policies greatly unpopular due infringement human rights. manufactured virus affects fertility would largely random accomplish objective. dude, need chill out. inject bleach hand sanitizer man. Trump said work. Chlorine injecting rays also work. Yup u got yr direct deposit...they probably didnt file via internet refund going bank account. difference. doubt irs even way separating people via race. Stop sowing discontent. They‚Äôre Mormons. Given choice pro science anti science, they‚Äôll take anti science every time. think we'll see stores conclude requiring ""mask wearing"" protect employees ""best practice"". following ""best practice"" could leave employer liable punitive damages employee becomes sick dies. Yeah know him, he‚Äôs remember it....still pretty sad announced shutdowns March 20th revealed tested positive virus March 27th (1 WEEK LATER).

You're telling coincidence virus kicking ass dramatic shift policy?

If truly believe that, magic beans sell you.

Edit: Including March 20, Johnson's government dramatically escalated response, ordering schools, pubs, restaurants, gyms social venues close across country.

Three days later addressed nation television, telling Britons go outside buy food, exercise day go work absolutely cannot work home.

But ministers continued conduct meetings person, despite reports staff Downing Street self-isolating developing coronavirus symptoms.

On March 27, Johnson revealed tested positive COVID-19 developing mild symptoms previous afternoon. Mass murder signifier. Freddy Kruger probably MAGA, even put effort anymore killing Elm Street. Elm Street Covid hotspot!

Edit: due social distancing, Jason Vorhees missed bunch kills Camp year. He's opening Camp again, full bunks! He's longer wearing mask scare libs. Trump says ""beleive nobody knows x me"" time.....so need believe actually knows experts every field talks about.....

Just subjects claims know anybody are:

ISIS, TV Ratings, Courts, Lawsuits, politicians, Visa System, Trade, Renewable Energy, Taxes, Debt, Money, Infrustructure, Democrats, economy(knows better Federal Reserve), Construction, Technology, Drones, COVID19. chicken pox antibodies drop couple months, technically still get shingles even successful vaccination chicken pox. round 2 cases typically couple decades person first time. 

The issue covid19 antibodies lasting months undetectable. still questions whether means reinfection possible point factors play, given know coronaviruses, seems unlikely sort lasting immunity possible. vaccine comes expect need annual thing keep immunity boosted  I‚Äôm still scratching head they‚Äôre waiting til 22nd institute policy. I‚Äôm sure could put sign tomorrow. waiting for? That's ideal 1 works.

We can, theory, see much quicker rollout current manufacturing deals place.

Distribution problem, sure. also traditionally extreme resistance vaccines areas oof looks like lot effort put mental gymnastics, would shame nobody read cared opinion I'm honestly excited this, much entertainment. ...after weeks pondering action. Crushin Florida constant posting articles essentially saying completely lose immunity doesn‚Äôt help. US contained either. feel end sight this, 1918 flu burned within couple years. many places took year. News like shows progress towards less virulent disease already happening. N95 better cheap surgical mask. Viral particles float right holes.

Spraying peroxide surgical mask also deactivate 99% virus mask. Nobody useful. need like 80% get immunity, 1 percent gotten overall. long ways away, probably better get vaccine Goya. Mine left toin Albuquerque people ability financial situations get money fast many still got issues like internet access like article mentions. that's common among black people racial inequalities here. Plot twist: vaccine made using dead virus monkey. injected humans renders us stupid. Monkeys get hold makes smart. Cue Planet Apes. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

Karma! want conversation walk away. Sorry opinions coming mouth. agree everything discussion

Ya kind test, genius? one sent testing takes number days get results? follow advice crawl back hidey-hole conversation testing school much handle. true sides political spectrum. Everyone loves good echo chamber. Unfortunately one particular echo chamber proving incredibly harmful unemployment rate may going down, PPP money gone soon true unemployment rate quickly realized. temporary expansion benefits assumed would use time get pandemic control, #LIBERATE MICHIGAN #LIBERATE WASHINGTON #LIBERATE NEW YORK. long hanging around sub? yes, constant refrain see people say 60+, old, near death, etc. anyway. also added /s believe all...however common retort high risk group (i.e. 50+) well, accept death par course.

I know old reddit saying that, considering Texas Lt. Governor Dan Patrick opinion older (i.e. risk) sacrifice keep economy strong...it's 15-year olds thinkg that. UK relies word ""country"" acts like constituent country nation-state so. even equal among themselves. (See law England Wales versus Scottish law)

The US constitution establishes states basic unit sovereignty. Obviously morphed years legally like UK constituent countries like, say, counties England. trying make 1:1 comparisons bad idea overall. sure Stacey Abrams would done thing. /s interesting, went weeks back Kohl's saw small handful customers wearing masks. (Wisconsin) Yeah, backtrack, like qualifier. think he's maintaining position pandemic overblown political gain trying deflect criticism acknowledging people suffering this. fueling fire even millions parents choose keep kids home instead working, families begin struggle financially. People stop paying rent, governors forced add assistance crushing economy even further. year two US wasteland time vaccine may may even provide protection longer 3 4 months. won‚Äôt see end 70% population dead crippled cannot work anyways. left government, military rich. Amazon rule, Jeff goes buys 90% land mass enslaves all. (Yes I‚Äôm sarcastic doom gloom..) look like 1/2 brothers. plank wood moved around Putin. need state, people pull guns people wearing mask know, one watching city love descend dystopian nightmare think it'll recover decades ever That's would've killed... Luckily need death rate much lower them. Dunning Kruger looks like real life. think Covid aid is? realize discussing giving Churches loans, wrong thread. frustrating nothing, discussion everyone points including petition making national. situation Northeast different south state different hotspots.

Of course national lockdown would help would tough convince full compliance, compromise possible actually leadership people working together.

Mask made mandatory states like Florida, Arizona, Texas, California lock surging cities. could even go different states limit counties. options include closing known infection created activities like indoor dining nationally.

That would reasonable way flatten curve. think would get flat would national lockdown, would make things stable assuming followed original guidelines 14 day declines monitoring positivity rates increased testing tracing.

Unfortunately see anyone trying make adjustments also never going happen either. would also imagine infrastructure allows test much more. Sounds white.  wonder China thinking right Florida let's spiral even control 13000 cases day much done american chains sound like german brand store. 5 days considered median amount time like person said vary good bit. Damn age well. Turns US, 2020 hindsight Right lol two choices President November

South Africa one African countries serious testing - Djibouti (micro island states aside) done tests per million inhabitants. Unsurprisingly, results South Africa country highest number confirmed cases deaths continent.

In rest continent, meanwhile, basically testing done, countries like Nigeria surges deaths, never tested covid... think people general people compensated according quality work. aren‚Äôt probably find another job. know wanted change laws would get politics. fucking protest. necessarily.....herd immunity achieved degree like viral pandemics naturally allowed go on....but death toll would great dont something mitigate it. cant let burn world let peter itself......this isnt Dark Ages..... bad son sick instead one doesn‚Äôt support believe Fauci incredibly wrong they‚Äôre stupid willfully ignorant argue with. rest us need fight hard everything he‚Äòs recommending.

She got twice. like anything anyway. probably temper tantrum Dr Redfield warning flu season coming already stressing hospitals. 
 states stop reporting numbers real trouble. might died covid morgues fill space anyone. could died something else, morgue full covid corpses put truck. Thats death rate spikes. took good year really know ICU. Covid patients crazy hard manage. Lol one guy comment section article complaining post linking numbers ISIS removed. False

Injecting lysol higher risk Mask orders one thing, trespassing another. He‚Äôs like everybody‚Äôs dad, put petulant kids...I feel bad him, he‚Äôs trying help people... HeaLTHy SuGaRs ‚ÄúDear Jesus,

‚ÄúThis Erik, grade three again. 

‚ÄúWe worried. parents morons. Seriously, herd immunity? We‚Äôre nowhere close 80% infection rate would take! Mr. Anderson 4B already gone lady across street hospital now. 

‚ÄúAuntie Kim bought sister really cute masks, we‚Äôre allowed wear them. Daddy said bunch bad words Kim completely ignoring decades evidence Asia plus recent studies argue effectiveness masks controlling contagion. 

‚ÄúPlease help Mom Dad get nationalism see Sweden trouble. consequences CDC longer reporting data ? Even return school? doubt it. deaths seem holding 1-2% alarming people paying attention. Stores around ‚Äúrequire‚Äù don‚Äôt enforce it. Kemp might worse, honestly. Fucker seems determined kill us.  Let's please stop nonsense! need united response levels. Set differences ego aside good fellow man. Let give one piece comprehension then: interested honest discussion even whether people live die. interested ""winning"" discrediting people think dishonestly calling liars, that's fine you. antibodies aren‚Äôt source immunity. jury still long actual immunity lasts, it‚Äôs likely 3-4 months bizarre knowingly lied face mask efficiency protest for? *currently* higher per capita death toll. also *currently* far higher percentage population immune virus, making remainder much safer. Containment could fail Norway 1% population could die December. could, Sweden's gamble pays off, happen Sweden. could almost every single death behind able reopen soon fully worries spread. That's gamble pays off.

But gamble pay off, even best case 5,000 deaths (0.05% population 2 extra weeks worth deaths) would nothing. Immunity could wear off, even second reinfection guaranteed mild, means efforts protect elderly would fail everyone would get eventually. could find perfect cure tomorrow, case none 5000 deaths necessary delayed them. could hold vaccine, giving result. Worst all, could find long-term health impacts survivors much higher previously thought, significant percentage population lifetime disabilities.

The odds gamble pays end called success story high. probably much easier time country come winter. hand, consequences gamble pay could catastrophic.

I agree given Sweden's position right Norway/Denmark/Finland, insistence using completely different strategy really dick move. could pretty easily controlled land borders essentially nobody Scandinavia infected. Instead three countries worry border control. even there, things could go way too: Sweden's immunity last, could make travel Nordic/European countries safer long run. instance, could fly Stockholm safely ""quarantine"" whatever want 14 days two test cycles continuing Copenhagen.

Beyond that, one important things world needs know long immunity lasts. Sweden going find months would known otherwise. Objectively, good thing someone taking crazy experiment. Well, could always people go make records like lady Florida, never official like CDC **Good anti maskers anti vaxxers children anyways** anyone know worldometers affected bypassing CDC hospitalization data? Republicans support small government choices, makes zero sense. doctors? better, see, know, them? Constituents stupid formulated opinion themselves. orouborous idiocy. closed loop human centipede. Meh current genarations soft. great grand parents born wars grew seeing light ffs. Sitting home weeks won‚Äôt end future. Children though. recover easily. Sorry Putin share credit working together. 

Fuck Canada take understand works. actually see herd immunity infections basically expect exponential infections hit 70% infection rate, drop really really fast (mostly week leading 1mil/day, rapidly drop thousands per day). good news FL still least month happens...

Actually, month really really bad. That‚Äôs fantastic! I‚Äôm happy hear it. =) Awesome work. mean it.

I never saying calories don‚Äôt matter. said, they‚Äôre crucial. They‚Äôre full story. every person needs eat less move more, people need change they‚Äôre eating (certain food sensitivities might causing digestive issues, they‚Äôre getting nutrients food, example), whose hormones whack, may underlying medical issues need addressed.

I think way handled best. went doctor first. almost like Somalia might issues developing implementing viable testing scheme nationwide. Obviously correlation drawn article fact South Africa, Egypt Kenya 'hotspots'. I'm 5'11 dropped 205 175 year. I've heard things. mind, travel abroad i'm still going larger people. could wear mask, like intelligent person. It‚Äôs probably need, chance happening administration. Nope. absolutely budge. He's pushing older employees retire since want stay home still, says ""they can't adapt"" take subtle threat we're fired back office.

Also boasts block parties rich people throw gated community every weekend. day lamenting state affair literally said, ""Think CEOs hurt them."" without shade irony. linked site clearly proving highest death toll per capita Europe right now.

So noticed left Serbia Macedonia. micronations Europe?

And can't find ""highest burden infection""-graph link. worst part she‚Äôs accused fearmongering social media. Apparently we‚Äôve fallen far people attacked giving updates horrific situation living through. don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs denial stupidity, thing going keep burning us there‚Äôs vaccine. People stupid. female WWE ( wrestling ) employee confirm Twitter already got twice... months apart?

 There's real way could possibly spin good thing. 

Dude, there's conservatives downplayed whole bounty shit. honestly believe try pull shit? I've heard could good stay sleep separate rooms could increase other's viral load close proximity higher viral load could lead severe illness. vice versa think ones pushing 1984 coercing businesses state stays( ala strike force California) hear things like ""vaccine registrations certificates"" raises red flags them. Wear mask, socially distance wash hands. lesson learned hard way country. filter weed stupid unfortunately weak. Learn adapt willing deal consequences. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs tiny. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs 2016 either. big issue temporary vs permanent orders. burden proof temporary order far lower permanent decision.

Basically, even small chance could harm suffered action taken one party, unusual temporary stay issued action. harm generally seen minimal, temporary nature. issuance temporary stays often means case clear enough something like successful motion summary judgment. 

Essentially, temporary orders equal permanent orders actual judicial decisions.

Is asking? us get Hazard Pay. Haha bet could get convenience store one breath Corporations government. Duh. Garbage humans. I'm waiting new data suggesting Goya products feature unique ingredient boosts immune response virus. Actually that‚Äôs one reasons Oxford candidate looks extremely promising, doesn‚Äôt trigger antibodies (I.e humoral immunity) also seems activate cytotoxic T-cells well! sense provides ‚Äúdouble‚Äù immunity, words uses multiple immune system pathways have. gullible. Looks like it, number daily cases hospital stats showing plateau slight decline. visible abs

That also might mean high amount visceral vs. subcutaneous fat, incredibly unhealthy itself. true, people congregating LOT inside right it‚Äôs unbearable outside. agree you. lack national coordination reason we‚Äôll dealing long time. Doesn‚Äôt matter. Statements like ‚Äúmasks increase risk getting COVID‚Äù completely obliterated credibility. build COVID19 water cannon spray everyone virus infected water, onto screaming, laughing smiling children parents ... singing ""It's pandemic all, pandemic ..."" Testing much limited last peak, hard compare. Watch hospitalizations deaths - give us accurate point comparison peak continues  movie harassing discriminating someone super pale torture, hope watching news lately.  people flip whatever argument suits them, deaths, infections, % infections, masks don‚Äôt work, etc they‚Äôre proven wrong swap new argument justification, it‚Äôs ludicrous. We're winning!! Funny, upvoted... :-) 

real life problem tho: NY controversial data. [John Hopkins (in Admin1 window) NY 404,006 worldometer 430,227. difference tons ""probable COVID cases"", worldometer keeps 'em John Hopkins not. data ""COVID-19 Activity.csv"" downloaded NY 407,875 yesterday. Based that, NY 412,000 5 6 days, 412,000 target calculated California Florida with, California 346,593 Florida 291,621. 

Using worldometer data 3 states, (430,227 (7/15); 355,285 (7/15); 315,775 (7/16) ) *almost* dead heat. NY 438,000 8 9 days, California beat Florida 438,000 half day, 7.8 days 8.3 days. California plateaus right now... still beat Florida 8.0 days 8.3. even account Florida possibly building backlog right get week, official cases may ""slow down"" momentarily virtue inability process count fast. 

TL;DR: could somehow estimate ""hidden cases"" accurately added in, course Florida could beat California NY. official numbers, Bob accountant even run, kind skitter mosey (slowly moving) finish line still nip Usain Bolt comfortably couple steps.  Thank you. Thank sharing link. puts succinctly can't.

Yknow‚Äî protect themselves, too. confirmed yet similar position although I'm asymptomatic. exposed someone tested positive almost 2 weeks ago got tested Monday. expecting results today self-quarrantining without confirmed answer really challenging. called agent based modelling. Rather trying different mathematical models, agent based models simulate large number agents (say people country), visualised small dots moving around, give rules behave, well giving infected agents chance spreading disease uninfected agents close contact with.

Then add rules agents act (say could assume 40% wore masks masks gave 30% chance warding infection, could assume nobody wore masks 60% people stayed home), running given set rules number times average build predictions based enforcing/encouraging certain behavior. 

Those simulations amazing literally model behavior every single person model. know country researchers complex physics, kind models used wide array purposes, making epidemiological models ministry using exact method.

Sorry based past 3.5 years evidence completely disagree. Canadian dog fight, think rabid extreme view would saying Covid could crumple USA empire. That‚Äôs going happen.

Yeah, hate people keep using argument. NY 5-10 deaths day last month, states beginning spike again. leadership far perfect, managed bend curve. Oh Stitt. They‚Äôre coming.

It would nice see numbers broken down, depending much info collected tests might readily available, and/or might lot labour-intensive put together, useful without breakdown. 1. NIAID agreed take on?
2. 330 million COVID-19 tests administered? doubt capacity produce even close many tests
3. going responsible administering tests processing them? disseminating results individual people? We'd need MASSIVE task force this; much, much NIAID provide. Assuming somehow test 300 million people, hell going process these? We'd need tens, hundreds, thousands people working this

This appears random guy connections anyone NIAID whatsoever. looks like personal website nothing even close official endorsed parties listed contributors. gonna happen. Maybe, maybe not. mutations meaningless, ones lead different strains really propagate mutation gives virus selective advantage, meaning, virus fit propagate before.

Covid-19 seems pretty well situated environment much pressure evolve, evolve, generally (but certainly always) mutations lead less deadly strain allow virus spread farther. 

Furthermore, although coronavirus great RNA checker (a feature double checks RNA reproducing make sure genetic code copied correctly, know scientific name) rudimentary one. lessens amount genetic mutations one generation next somewhat. Covid-19 mutate, mutate relatively slowly compared virus like influenza. 

Lastly, one infected, virus produce billions billions copies, inevitable copies mutations even virus good copying genetic code, however, mutation take hold society, mutated virus jump one person another, become dominate strain within body, start spreading more. selective pressure plays big role virus mutation. virus becomes deadly, people die spread strain eventually dies out. virus pressure become contagious, make people sick longer (giving virus opportunity spread), make incubation period longer, etc. things covid-19 already excels at.

Second lastly, Antibodies T-cells still work viruses superficial differences. amount anti-genetic drift needed body recognize virus pretty substantial. like best friend getting rhinoplasty, superficial change anything change personality friend fail recognize simply nose shape slightly different before. can't give credit someone doesnt believe authoritarian regimes Great job! gained 8 lost it. need lose 20 gained writing thesis happened. patients people though, states. Exactly Yep, Imperial College‚Äôs vaccine actually plans reach billions people around world early next People may also start social distancing choice point--there's evidence infection rates UK came little government mandated lockdown distancing measures, probably percentage people saw writing wall took steps (I know started keep little distance people weeks earlier, really took steps curtail movement interactions two weeks official measures taken). Even people, reduction movement effect. Maybe they'll consider cases hit 20k day. promises though. Thank you. read first second paragraph page 32 say like article. correct. 

Now really don‚Äôt understand governor issued explicitly order. encourage face masks allow others requiring face masks. benefit it? thought people closer 7-10 days, admittedly there's lot information floating around. could misinformed, source 3-5 days? really min-boggling complete lack focus preparing distance learning. end school year last year complete waste students, teachers administrators clue doing. Since absolutely dick done prepare distance learning fall. months research best practices develop guidelines curriculum distance learning. Even schools open up, inevitably forced close (I'd bet anything they're closed Thanksgiving), still plan effective distance learning. pretty fucked message ""we've totally got enough room sick dead!"" instead ""this going prevent people getting sick dying."" good general though even though weird gonna take 2 weeks implement it. Target, Kroger stores, Walmart trafficked places country mask mandates guarantee slower rate spread gives hospitals break allows re-coup past 4 weeks hell they've experiencing Sunbelt. sad thing corporations acting federal government is. time nothing American that. tested negative leaving port. Ah understand point now. thought trying say Republicans expecting people decide vote situation chaotic. Yes, you‚Äôre right, going messy election voter access. don‚Äôt believe legality delaying presidential election, is. car's fire there's driver wheel

And dark wind blows

Job's board Problem is, could become physical really fast. Aren‚Äôt pneumonia deaths something like 750% time last year? Poor patients though. Reported unfollowed obviously Probably this: Zoom call right catch watch confirm) government fails act, best hope corporations enforce minimal protection public (with profit motive heart it). dystopian shit, man. see lot threads. large spikes mean 4,000-5,000 dead day they're looking for. It‚Äôs low. thing low first months epicenter pandemic. saying low rate doenst say much number rise. It‚Äôs proof records high deaths two weeks row. say that?

But Palestine governing bodies report covid statistics within jurisdiction. think days still using adderall. definitely seems like he‚Äôs something compared current rambling nonsense. cdc several animals known infected covid 19, rabbits list.

So far, appears known reports pet dogs, cats, lions, tigers, minks. Must read. [Florida hidden data skews positivity rate COVID-19 thought making up.  providing perfect protection people think is

He's wrong there. effective perfect. 

Now, Trump! next mandate order us play traffic? psychopath. Stay safe good people Georgia :( START NOW. good idea Monday, great idea now. Jesus. conveninet end proi-democracy protests leave scientists chart path future.

that important listen scientists' advice frontier crisis. virus completely passive agent, want anything. lost credibility one. huge blow ""trust science"" messaging. probably still true, him. also remember held back testing took Cuomo basically call Trump national tv pressure FDA get testing sites approve. done drive thru testing began next day New Rochelle, time epicenter. Wearing mask maskless area equivalent sitting wrong team's side full jersey display. It‚Äôs fault, I‚Äôm big boned actually think great analogy, least wrt mandates adults. could bias; far sympathy choice (and sad childhood anecdote past ties directly ""choice"").

Decidedly masks. Selfish bastards indeed. People don‚Äôt either trust data don‚Äôt understand science?

I think first issue there's emotional need reality true. Everything else backfilled support pre-existing conclusion. 

Rather like Upton Sinclair quote, ""It difficult get man understand something salary depends upon understanding it"", scientific literacy first hurdle here. first hurdle getting people want even try understand. want to, they'll simply avoid information confirm desired belief real/overblown/etc. see that's issue individualism capitalism,you wear mask protect protect elderly immunocompromised people however since virus really affect personally,they care people Reopening matter one goes store shop.

Also, washing hands poses greater risk wearing mask poses threat outhers, there's outrage people often enough. ü•á ü•á ü•á Making coherent, logically sound arguments, starters. people want free market competition also ones begging government handouts. Sars1 respiratory infection causes acute severe respiratory symptoms spike protein damage host cell immediately. 

Sars2 genetically similar coronavirus cause systemic infection spike protein cause damage host cell immediately. 

Sars2 attacks immunity cells destroy them. 

So prove much sars1 patients still immunity cells even get length immunity response sars2, sars2 still attacks cells destroy them. 

Our bodies get rid sars2 recognising infection destroy living tissue. 

If immunity cells could actually directly destroy virus, would another matter. getting cytokine storm time body recognise sars2 infection back, exactly help much.

I giving actions, sinking feeling nothing. though 875? I've seen criticism accuracy, here's one I'm familiar Great article. absolutely adore Anthony Fauci ‚ù§. Underweight = 18.4 under

Normal = 18.5-24.9

Overweight = 25-29.9.

Obese = 30 above

Morbidly obese = 40 above. Well there‚Äôs probably reason majority doctors scientists used continue use large groups populations generally accurate. 

The overwhelming majority people aren‚Äôt body builders, NFL players, fastest man earth, Olympic swimmers. 

Unless see sudden outbreak Olympic athletes I‚Äôm grocery store, BMI probably fair measure body composition give average person average idea weight impacting health risks. 

Currently, see overweight obese Americans chose actively ignore helpful data, like BMI, control weight. love stories have. Dolphin fan allowed preseason games working regular games. Well Florida. One best comments subreddit lol Based rising numbers, makes things worse. know that, right? Yep. hoax dead actors. I'm pretty sure hospital bills also fake we'll see people alive done. mean 130K+ dead people months??! Nothing wrong that! 

/s Coronavirus likes this... means you‚Äôre funny.

I falsely accused publishing out-of-date information.

The article contains information actually justifies Trump administration says.

This sub suppressing valid news websites apparently maintains ""list"" - one even get see apparently includes web sites someone ""thinks"" going disagree Trump article posted it.

No. would suggest using word ""you"" accusation first since changes topic actual news Coronavirus ""some redditor side screen named 'you'""

It's topic. Sounds like anti-mask brigade can't pull woolery eyes anymore. dozen friends went bar 2 weeks ago celebrate end quarantine. 

Yesterday owner/bartender bar (who also part company) got positive covid test. Okay, I‚Äôll outline problems proposed Tasers make thick clothing. Pepper spray always effective determined 9mm 147gr HSTs penetrate 16‚Äù consistently. 

Do hear speaking? ""Determined attacker"". understand normal people use kinds phrases? betray kind world created yourself. Determined attackers intent kill incredibly rare, especially man. taking far fetched scenario blowing proportion justify choices fact. like guns. want gun. need reason gun. invent one. That's gun community talk bullshit phrases like ""determined attacker"". role playing except Wizards +2 intelligence ""attackers"" ""9mm 147gr HSTs"". yeah, fucking hobby.

The point balance probabilities, average person likely *never* need lethal defense force. saying is, unlikely case get attacked unlikely case scenario less lethal response effective, want gun you.

The first response that, viewpoint society, lives saved people guns people guns. people die gun accidents lives saved people guns defend themselves. society OK that? And, gun owner - knowing chances accidents much higher chances ""determined attacker"", would put gun around house family? forget, ""responsible"", accidents happen you. Except course everyone thinks. accidents happen, even responsible people. That's *accidents*. 

Secondly, also ignores fact simply gun escalates situation. robbery might result violence, unless victim pulls gun. Harm either robber likely averted escalation. lifes worth stuff carrying? also numerous examples police erroneously shooting responsible gun owner. point is, guns prevent harm, cause harm, escalate situation inherently would want de-escalate. 

There argument ""safety"" comes guns. Yeah, maybe, you, personally, unlikely situation. point view society, guns cause harm good. lot. 

What saying willing put safety incredibly unlikely *potential* situation real *actual* societal harm mass gun ownership creates. That's egotistical argument. New record tomorrow! 

Anyone sending CDC? That's mask wearing, found every major poll, partisan issue. Republicans likely independents wear masks. Democrats likely wear marginal amount, amount could explained away fact likely live cities thus forced wear often. got pretty surreal him. probably one greatest health crises he's ever faced US, he's job he's always done.. he's attacked made villain. got pretty weird going work everyday. believe Trump re-elected. belief makes unpopular conversationalist. achieved super low death rate Asian countries already, say technically cure covid, that‚Äôs US put focus learning way treat it. Containment simply possible, waste effort convince people wear masks, it‚Äôs waste time containment. *""Expose virus right assume robber!""*

While owner obviously blithering idiot, solution simple, dont go store. I'd imagine relatively high urbanisation rate fact winter SA likely factors well. sick enough pass wearing mask likely unhealthy enough shopping Walmart global pandemic.

They good situation. aren‚Äôt flattening curve. get worse unless go another lockdown. Countries good situation ones took good measures. Treatments improved, hospitals ready. still don‚Äôt want overwhelm them. Virus won‚Äôt go away infected %5 population vaccine. It‚Äôs pipe dream. World reporting 230k cases day, definitely negative things. much United then... Sure caused bad government. government bad coopted late stage capitalism. Neither government economy exists vacuum. Time4learning, Acellus, K12 ones come mind first. Lazy French fuck interesting see ultimately whether cases result reinfection elsewhere, virus lying dormant somehow mild infection. get evidence is. 

Let's examine timeline:

Boris already begining take virus seriously lockdown implemented UK starters, giving daily press briefings alongside scientific advisors explain plan, suggest already heading lockdown. American obviously know this. week lockdown implemented, schools, pubs, bars clubs closed, plus football cancelled. 

Then came full lockdown, address Boris clearly communicated Nation seriousness virus. address watched TV program British history.

1 week later, Boris, along senior figures, tested positive virus. mild symptoms. Boris used positive test reiterate virus discriminate, important follow advice. believe week later condition deteriorated, put intensive care. 

After discharged continued play dangerous virus is. said suffered obese, wanted launch campaign help fight obesity pandemic UK increasing cycling implementing sugar tax.

I know interpreted Boris changing mind got it. explain arguments try offer counter arguments.

I assuming main arguments are:

1. Boris selfish took virus seriously contracted it.

2. Boris significant amount power country basically says.

I add Boris supporter, voted previously planning future Yup. went school back old days (ok long ago) rural vermont coorespndance school winter possible get bus car reliably hour long dirt road ride school feet snow. went school september november end april june. rest time everything via mail phone. Shocker..distance learning thing decades course done. Parents kids able make changes buckle down. Covid baby names, go! One hope.

Correct. basically breakdown carbohydrate metabolism, number mechanisms cause happen. Type 1 auto-immune disease specific, Type 2 multi-factoral.

Trade military alliances said hypothetical countries complicated topic. sorry. lot deal with. Handwashing VS mask questions sociomedical perspective:

1. months research, know handwashing effective limiting spread wearing masks?

2. handwashing effective, societal pressure media coverage wear mask rather wash hands often, thoroughly, 30 seconds?

3. COVID-19 primarily transmitted air droplets real-life settings (e.g., South Korean call centre), deduction, mean virus getting respiratory system touching surfaces face?

4. mask used visual indicator people taking pandemic seriously versus people not? getting much attention handwashing?

Speculatively, hypothesis relying people procure masks would less effective poster signs plastered everywhere inside stores, buildings, public spaces advocate longer/thorough handwashing around, coughing sneezing elbows, placing hand sanitation stations entrance, exit, places get lot foot traffic. somewhat supported un-peer-reviewed article based Thailand suggests individuals socially distance, reduce close contact, wash hands linked lower percentages COVID-19 infection: need hear people complaining able breathe either (despite false) alternative overhandwashing pruney hands. Plus, unlike masks, benefits proper handwashing exist far longer future facets people's lives (other infectious sicknesses, washroom hygiene, food / medical industry, etc.) wearing masks temporarily pandemics. 

By way, I've wearing mask every time go since March.  Absolutely. That, ~~and~~ *with* inability admit wrong.

Scientific data public sphere usually shared, don‚Äôt want constant data dumps, would mean everyone would waste time processing. It‚Äôs better intervals (such studies significant conclusions/findings). It‚Äôs different story private/corporate scientific data since usually significant degree profit motive involved. Official data covid deaths Lombardy Italy, like severely affected countries regions, incomplete possible, especially (in Italy‚Äôs case) March worst-hit provinces, test victims covid; thousands people died covid, especially retirement homes lesser extent homes, buried without ever tested virus, result included official death toll, consequently underestimate. Data excess deaths instead offer accurate view actual death toll pandemic.

Using data table Italian National Institute Statistics (ISTAT) (available created table shows number excess deaths (almost) every municipality Lombardy, period 1 January 31 May 2020, compared historical average months 2015 2019.

As blogger let publish page table, reasons don‚Äôt understand (too heavy? images even heavier‚Ä¶) forced take screenshots table put page. best solution, agree, could come anything better.

Available data cover 1,469 municipalities, 1,506 municipalities Lombardy (97.5 %). precisely, data covers 241 243 municipalities province Bergamo, 203 206 province Brescia, 143 160 province Como, 112 115 province Cremona, 82 85 province Lecco, 59 61 province Lodi, 62 70 province Mantua, 131 134 province Milan, 53 55 province Monza, 176 188 province Pavia, 77 78 province Sondrio, 130 141 province Varese.

Of 1,469 municipalities, 1,220 (83 %) saw increase mortalit√†, 151 (10,3 %) saw decrease mortalit√†, 98 (6,7 %) saw neither increase decrease.

Excess deaths Lombardy, province:

Province Bergamo: 6011 excess deaths (+6019 municipalities saw increase mortality, -8 municipalities mortalit√† decreased) 

Province Brescia: 4306 excess deaths (+4337, -31) 

Province Como: 720 excess deaths (+782, -62) 

Province Cremona: 2039 excess deaths (+2043, -4) 

Province Lecco: 876 excess deaths (+886, -10) 

Province Lodi: 928 excess deaths (+936, -8) 

Province Mantua: 825 excess deaths (+837, -12) 

Province Milan: 5086 excess deaths (+5103, -17) 

Province Monza: 1329 excess deaths (+1334, -5) 

Province Pavia: 414 excess deaths (+442, -28) 

Province Sondrio: 289 excess deaths (+318, -29) 

Province Varese: 676 excess deaths (+759, -83)

Altogether, Lombardy saw 23,499 excess deaths 1 January 31 May 2020, 6,751 16,748 official covid victims region 12 July 2020. underestimate comes mostly worst-affected provinces, especially Bergamo, excess deaths almost twice number official covid deaths.

Excess deaths percentage overall population, province:

Bergamo: 0,54 % (overall population: 1,110,457) 

Brescia: 0,34 % (overall population: 1,262,135) 

Como: 0,12 % (overall population: 599,637) 

Cremona: 0,57 % (overall population: 358,578) 

Lecco: 0,26 % (overall population: 337,256) 

Lodi: 0,40 % (overall population: 229,946) 

Mantua: 0,20 % (overall population: 411,959) 

Milan: 0,16 % (overall population: 3,233,541) 

Monza: 0,15 % (overall population: 871,523) 

Pavia: 0,07 % (overall population: 545,611) 

Sondrio: 0,16 % (overall population: 181,249) 

Varese: 0,08 % (overall population: 890,418)

The pattern mortality markedly dishomogeneous; provinces experienced excess mortalit√†, excess deaths amounted less 0.10 % overall population two provinces (Pavia Varese), 0.10 % 0.19 % four (Como, Milan, Monza, Sondrio), 0.20 0.29 % two (Lecco Mantua), 0.30 0.39 % one (Brescia), 0.40 0.49 % one (Lodi) 0.50 % two (Bergamo Cremona). difference explained lockdown, prevented virus spreading provinces measure ones original clusters found (Lodi Bergamo) ones neighboured (Cremona Brescia; indeed, four provinces ones highest increase mortality).

It worth pointing Lodi, province Codogno first ‚Äúred zone‚Äù located, experienced considerable excess mortality, considerably lower one experienced neighbouring Cremona Bergamo. seem implausible speculate difference may caused creation ‚Äúred zone‚Äù Codogno surroundings, slowed spread virus province, left free spread Cremona (owing vicinity Lodi) Bergamo (owing outbreak Nembro Alzano Lombardo, ‚Äúred zone‚Äù created) time passed creation ‚Äúred zone‚Äù province Lodi (23 February) imposition lockdown Lombardy (8 March).

I think details provinces Bergamo Cremona, affected ones, could interest.

In province Cremona, excess deaths twelve municipalities (Acquanegra Cremonese, Casalbuttano ed Uniti, Casalmorano, Cingia de‚Äô Botti, Crotta d‚ÄôAdda, Robecco d‚ÄôOglio, San Martino del Lago, Scandolara Rivara, Solarolo Rainerio, Sospiro, Stagno Lombardo, Trigolo) exceeded 1 % entire population; worst-hit municipality Cingia de‚Äô Botti, excess deaths amounted 3.36 % 1,220 inhabitants, followed Casalbuttano ed Uniti (1.92 % 3,851 inhabitants), Scandolara Rivara (1.86 % 1,346 inhabitants) Casalmorano (1.85 % 1,622 inhabitants). province three municipalities (Crema, Cremona, Casalmaggiore) exceed 10,000 inhabitants, two municipalities saw hundred excess deaths: provincial capital, Cremona (403 excess deaths population 72,680), Crema, second largest town (219 excess deaths population 34,633).

In province Bergamo, municipalities excess deaths amounted 1 % population thirty-three: Averara, Azzone, Bianzano, Brembate di Sopra, Brumano, Camerata Cornello, Carona, Casnigo, Cassiglio, Cene, Clusone, Costa Valle Imagna, Cusio, Fiorano al Serio, Fonteno, Gazzaniga, Leffe, Lenna, Moio de‚Äô Calvi, Nembro, Oneta, Ornica, Parzanica, Piazzatorre, San Pellegrino Terme, Santa Brigida, Schilpario, Songavazzo, Valbondione, Valleve, Valtorta, Villa d‚ÄôAdda, Zogno. worst affected ones, percentage wise, small mountain villages Fonteno (where excess deaths amounted 2.45 % 571 inhabitants), Cusio (2.13 % 235 inhabitants), Piazzatorre (1.79 % 390 inhabitants) Costa Valle Imagna (1.78 % 562 inhabitants). seven municipalities excess deaths hundred: Bergamo (622 excess deaths population 122,383), Seriate (152 population 25,505), Nembro (151 population 11,508), Albino (148 population 17,778), Treviglio (123 population 30,930), Dalmine (122 population 23,655), Alzano Lombardo (108 population 13,701).

It worth noting nearly excess deaths occurred months March April 2020. months January February, overall mortality actually slightly lower average period 2015-2019; May gone back pre-covid levels. one compared mortality March-April 2020 March-April 2015-2019, number excess deaths would even higher. stupid. Can't risk losing profits!!!! Nothing see here, everything fine, open schools, line pockets taxpayer money, long live Supreme Leader Donald Trump, etc. (/s) Release Science Guy!!!!!!

Ominous Chanting: Bill Bill Bill Bill wait? pandemic happening like yesterday  arent many new jobs one's like

 ""hiring logistics management position, duties include *insert like four unrelated seperate job descriptions here*. Must bachelor's degree higher ten years experience must speak fluent Irish Japanese. Free coffee every morning (doesnt mention benefits). $15 $16 NYC."" keep calling mine quarantine fifteen. nice ring it. (Soon quarantine-y forty) r/PublicFreakout going massive field day next week variables need consider aside ""case load increase"" comparing NYC:

1. NYC greater NYC metropolitan area magnitudes larger population population density city Florida.

2. mentioned - time infection patients going critical 2 - 3 weeks.

3. NY first epicenter US. Since time rest country world learned lot treating critical patients means gotten little better saving lives

4. Saving critical patients requires overwhelmed. hospitals run space resources unfortunate result higher death tolls. 

All goes back entire reason mask wearing, social distancing shutdowns implemented first place - slow spread allow doctors hospitals time treat reasonable case load counts properly. virus go away, get less deadly ... slowed taking action. seeing people ignore actions declaring victory early results clearly showing resurgence virus. Sadly Florida southern states going see death tolls August relatively proportional saw NY.  true, hope get vaccine. would Darwin/God Darwin/God must. dumbass, ability create dumbasses removed.

Unfortunately 0 scientific evidence support claim infertility. even click link became hesitant.. = news media, local news media outlet.

Getting people right thing going happen keep happening: 
\* Sending half-truths/lies scare people 
\* Sending half-truths/lies convince people nothing bad happening

The former actually worse latter. Click bait Seems like people trying, Trump pretty good inciting fury patriotism amongst fan base order silence opposition voices.

I'm American myself, November thing hope country, rather anything get involved myself. RIP Georgia like watching dog intimidate image mirror never wanting back down. you‚Äôre toting censorship trump censor public health covid ignoring cdc‚Äôs existence asking dara directly fuck man hospitals forbidden sharing data CDC?

How could possibly enforceable?

Physicians sworn harm. I‚Äôm claiming that. I‚Äôm saying could believe case. study came earlier pandemic suggested Covid may permanently lower testosterone levels. something virus attaching endocrine system. haven‚Äôt heard anything since one study tho. Could definitely something worry about. bit crazy. get concerned hour I'm spending grocery supply shopping week; can't imagine spending 8+ hour day around people, whether masks not. Especially July heat -- can't imagine good number people hanging inside air-conditioned venues. masks social distancing good, I'd rather hang near people hours end.

But lot people, safer jobs (grocery store clerks, medical workers, etc). exercise pretty heavily, changes make lose weight almost exclusively dietary. Sleep always issue me, could right that. pure numbers perspective, I'd say bring on, since entirely inevitable point anyway. Let erode declining support numbers start show ""silver lining"" actually red herring really way try spin complete total incompetence somehow producing results. I'm European M, Korean L-XL, Walmart XS.

The worst part can't find size S/XS long enough. assume size small short something. Guess millennials worry retirement homes mammalian species transmit back humans, least, proven, except case minks. think cats shown transmit back humans though. hiding data republican administration incredibly dangerous everyone. clarify said 'leftist' referring insane 'everybody agree Nazi' types totally lost touch reality. liberals general can, course, totally reasonable. consider one least see British person realise already taking virus seriously because, ya know, live here.

You'd certainly think would apparent them, impression I'm getting. see people casually claiming Boris literally nothing time. know missed months lockdown (2 really full on), furlough scheme endless policies place. Yet apparently passed by. even saw someone claiming Boris chose nothing discovered coronavirus dangerous ethnic minorities. Again, appreciate everyone left leaning sympathies UK attitude seems become prevalent day, I'm seeing Reddit, Facebook, hearing people say public etc. know anecdotal can't seem go anywhere without coming across thinking.

*I fully comprehend question first replied. want kids go back school, yet least. We're going wrong direction virus spreading faster. seen fully thought plan get kids back school. Schools can't afford make sure teachers school supplies year (every parent purchase supplies classroom, including Clorox wipes), going afford keep classrooms clean disinfected regularly? I've also seen sort hybrid/part time school sessions brought up, seem disruptive parent's work schedules full distance learning situation. seem good answers resume schooling, I'd rather keep kids home try keep virus exposure minimum. I'm also Washington. town, mask wearing good consistent. travel rural areas, zero masks. stop rural minimart one wearing mask. Hmmm, still enough incentive lose weight.

That issue. need reform payday loans HR Block practices. honestly idea still going work caring people can't even bothered wear mask protect others. Carry wallowing ignorance then. Thought first, sure. US/UK/China lot people ""alternative"" medicine &amp; conspiracy theories. UK/US seem anti-maskers China enforce strict lockdown keep people in. world concerned?? read one article make assumptions it‚Äôs automatically bad thing name Trump behind it. Holy hell can‚Äôt possibly sheltered actually believe president racist shithead wants tear economy get rid every race except white hahahahah. people crack up. try respond figured something nobody entire world knows.

Seatbelts also contested like masks right now.

Seems like laws often reflect lowest common denominator(the stupidest people, like tf actually needs beastiality laws screw animals?). People opposed seatbelts argued infringed rights poor drivers dictate drive blah blah blah. many people died practicing priviledge though(that's is, beyond basic liberties, privilege rights) harmed others projectiled bodies. 

It's amazing people ignore argue advice essentially, ""this prevent death"" get surprised pikachu face government steps prevent death. Like, everyone agreed try kill other, would probably much fewer laws.

In addition list seatbelt laws, also DUI laws, helmet laws, j walking laws, drug legislation, age laws restrict beyond 18 years, etc. people oppose logic disregard safety concerns public opinion support enforcement. funny really seems conservatives(less government) make majority antimaskers, causing government take kind action. I'm sad many world listening experts. Denmark I'm cautious go protect myself. we're currently around 300 infected ~5 million people. can't imagine mental state lived US. Stay safe help eachother! I'm going agree comments. would really like see another set death statistics based date death. It'd give us accurate picture especially since believe hospital admissions probably reported real time.

Of course since people end getting tested random times intervals contacting virus clearest picture still think it'd helpful. at, I'm little taller. Unfortunately I've put weight back damn virus. Went martial arts 7h/week zero... next three months? movies here, hell stuff running right German movies came right shutdown happened. produce enough movies completely compensate US share falling away. Especially since releases production planned around expectation movies releasing certain time. Yes, that's exactly bypassed CDC. fudge numbers. surprising think months ago...

Eww. Creepy. yep, blame game... Champion World! Oh idea miserable here. Frankly, can‚Äôt even say too. people (who kidding? half the) states... can‚Äôt imagine it. I‚Äôm NY &amp; got real, took seriously. didn‚Äôt experience selfishness firsthand. Reading articles watching videos anti-maskers isn‚Äôt same. know right?

Anyone thinks otherwise including NCAA delusional. initial reaction ""fuck you, Chuck"", takes people learn grow we're better accepting community sane. many idiots listening Chuck Woolery, certainly use help. misleading title.

Based pathophysiology discussed article, following discovered:

- COVID-19 interacts sperm, virus found present samples semen infected. means possible transmission occur sexually (important infected asymptomatic experiencing typical respiratory sxs).

- COVID‚Äôs effect sperm causes release AT-II, hormone effecting kidney function blood pressure, causes cascade responses body, eventually lead lower levels hormones (FSH, LH) directly affect testosterone sperm production. Additionally, cascade leads cell death specific sperm cells affected COVID-19.

- Yes, effects mean virus could lead infertility, effect may well temporary. body recovers, hormonal levels return baseline, sperm production resume. speculation, long-term effects really won‚Äôt known carefully studied long periods time, years even.

- Something study address AT-II also stress-based hormone, may also related signaling cascade causing hyper-inflammatory response body. primary reason patients infected COVID-19 develop severe distress, ultimately die. process declared Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome, MIS short (MIS-c term process children adolescents). information related COVID‚Äôs interaction sperm could breakthrough understanding control hyper inflammatory response body, could mean effective means lower mortality, maybe even long-term morbidity. Again, speculation, promising.

Hope helps clear information regarding article. That's one possibility, Moderna one first shot 2nd shot weeks later. antibody b-cell/t-cell response weak X months, maybe another vaccine would needed.

There still many variables, think reasonable assume *first* vaccine 100% effective provide life-long immunity. may 60-70% effective, reduce symptoms/mortality, that's going good enough rushed ""first try"". Maybe 5 years we'll one that's effective last longer. tell customer policy, barge call law enforcement trespass them. used work asset management large retailer, reverse process.

Okay, I‚Äôll outline problems proposed alternatives:

‚ÄúFeeling manly‚Äù starts way fights ends. Staying wire invisible best defense. best fight one doesn‚Äôt happen. apparent way respond, aggression palpable.

I get somewhat irritated someone doesn‚Äôt clue they‚Äôre talking (you, instance) accuses level asshats. way exactly irresponsible gun owners. like feeling power gun gives you. 

I couldn‚Äôt care less ‚Äúpower.‚Äù don‚Äôt know me. want ability fear attacker. Show tool well gun I‚Äôll happily leave home. It‚Äôs another thing carry me. Think Epipen‚Äî hope never need it, don‚Äôt I‚Äôd fucked. strip away bullshit, that's want comes to. want give feeling up, willing let society suffer.

I don‚Äôt think make society suffer. worst, much less impact society many much less important things do. instance, number people killed second hand smoke alone dwarfs number gun deaths. It‚Äôs double remember correctly. one times really wish right, even would make feel like complete jackass process. ... would expect work? worry Florida think elderly population. think way Federal government handling - shuffling responsibility individual states providing little guidance, oversight policies. way absolve things go badly. Instead standing united common foe, pooling sharing resources, fallen infighting, finger pointing blame. Get vote encourage everyone know ensure vote. evidence there. 

I'm sorry. asked suppressed. evidence. though, want uninsured patients needing expensive care. want people getting elective surgery can‚Äôt get without plan place pay it. They're banning talk covid main re-opening discussion thread. comments openly re-opening favor downvoted. Lol stores dont care either trying encourage worrywarts ok shop there.

You dumbassess see driving alone care wearing mask. given past approval posting. Yeah SARS 1 longer immunity, also many(if all) mild cases. Common cold coronavirus shown 6 month immunity. 

So possible get mild covid body store antibody info long term(cause bother thinks mild disease) whereas get bad maybe long term immunity? Partially true, you‚Äôre also downvoted you‚Äôre fucking annoying. Jesus Christ many comments going leave? Total jerk. DeSatan believe constitutional reasons could declare emergency guess could legislated away inclined. Either way, definitely agree good thing someone trying route. learn lot experiment. One thing consider avoided much trauma fear countries experiencing. sure valued seem insignificant. I‚Äôm happy businesses requiring them! Personally, gone anywhere outside small hometown since March. don‚Äôt feel safe businesses don‚Äôt require masks. Didn‚Äôt somebody get shot Dollar General mask argument? What‚Äôs scary many people base opinions headlines without reading articles. Right, get something better case need mask wrapped around mouth, ya know? wait till family member catches it. always seems humble tools. Florida: Anotha one Tubergen added believe state health data virus accurate, called coronavirus ""a flu strain.""

He believes customers offended sign, still around 2 p.m. Tuesday, July 14, anyone would offended sign likely one customers.

""I feel sorry people find things like offensive,"" said. ""Those people find Elmer Fudd's shotgun offensive. Lighten up."" Well good note criticize Fauci likely die soon. guesses gyms reopen California (Santa Barbara specifically)?? miss working :( made first post r/InternetIsBeautiful 200! Plenty progress made! (for reason allowed post morning) US get death rate like Asian countries , like 70k cases day 200-300 deaths, would enough bring completely ignore crowd 60% US, right it‚Äôs probably 40% suppprting ignore 60% suppprting aggressive measures. Contact tracing really possible US anymore, put focus Asia countries manage even lower death rate. Makes sense doesnt take genius reach conclusion. Democrats live? Cities. viruses cause damage? Highly populated areas.

So based idea let fuck entire country. Seems like good trump logic golf course. sub always disaster fetishists. can‚Äôt helped, especially real disaster ongoing. We‚Äôre stuck rock hard place, Trumps asshat Biden‚Äôs pedo dementia. Yang would‚Äôve best candidate imo. I‚Äôm California. Everyone wearing masks. I‚Äôm part town low case incidence rate. I‚Äôm worried family Florida. Facebook feed leaking. Trump said ‚ÄúNobody knows ______ me‚Äù hundreds things. guy genius! research awhile. hoped different story. God wish didn‚Äôt go office everyday surrounded maskless people think overblown. yep, lots things could impact rate spread. I'm less concerned exponential growth, though. seem point general public starts behaving properly. least places like Italy suggest that's case. 

So spread speeds up, people shit pants start social distancing, spread slows down. reason believe US way... partly /probably NY able keep spread reasonable level now. governments do, others don't. need check local laws. find solid info either. I'd say worried, use already know virus. Prolonged contact bad, need room help something try 10 minutes less, times day. know wearing mask helps protect others getting virus us, wear mask around her. think long taking precautions ok help out. smart hopefully two way feeling better soon!

Obviously Biden make sure gets hands asap gets elected. Trump, well, enigma one knows. Currently stuck ND, people devout proud anti-intellectuals. I'm used local news comment sections looking like hot garbage, weird way good reminded people like everywhere.

It's *good*, obviously. nice reminded I'm alone one sea it. Anyone outside dumb state friends family trying come vacation visit, tell stay away. Seriously, bad here. Less 1/3 people wear masks. Restaurants eateries say 50 percent capacity turn away customers. Local officials busy trying avoid responsibility anything, ones trying purposefully hampered state federal funding.

Stay away. Hilarious Russia touting vaccine mega success can't stand anti maskers either. absolutely love people like you. :) Thank making smile. Places already required masks. States, even. enforce meaningless. enforce it. Plenty people places requiring mask without one. one says thing.  live stores requiring masks least two months. wonder Florida get Disney themed COVID hospitals.

If US sells successful vaccine, US gets profit. someone steals research beats vaccine, like Russia, they're ones profit. 

Truthfully, vaccine *sales* research done would highly publicized. make sense cure world halting virus made universally available? Trumps left governors, why‚Äôs fault governor made banning face masks illegal state? I‚Äôm sick everyone blaming literally everything Trump, he‚Äôs idiot let‚Äôs act like every state fucking fault. Seems death rate low relative massive increase cases seen last month. I'm glad death rate increasing lock step case numbers.

Also, throughout entire thing small handful states make entire country look really bad. beginning primarily Northeast, FL, TX, AZ, CA. another month two, probably 4-5 states. rookie numbers. soon they'll stop reporting cases. Yeah, get daily data web site collects data individually state summarizes it. Also, OK, covid numbers posted daily OSDH website.

I think right idea. species society, we're much less advanced people think.  Violence inherent system.

Besides, actually use violence ultimate authority, corrupt governments deterrent... make peaceful revolution impossible, undertake violent revolution revolution happen. See, get people wanting get back work, showed masks showed could safe... sure, spreading plague.

BUT happened ton people without masks stood around real close people waved around banners calling governor nazi, calling Jesus medication/medical help need, calling plague hoax caused bill gates.

Then top that, plague warriors decided march around Harrisburg... hop back military trucks... kitted weapons plate carriers act bad assed. 

those fuckers decided larp soldiers need weapons armor protect ""nazi"" PA government.... rankle fact maybe wear mask protect disease.

Later tests showed know now, *infected person* much lower risk spreading wear mask, especially asymptomatic. healthy non-infected person still contract disease without mask (minus special masks, like N95) fact still remains. almost like information got cleared started learning, like science does.

* ""if believe story (and reason believe PCR test April false positive), appears perhaps Dengue-like worsening clinical syndrome upon reinfection.

Article reinfection (also indicating 2nd course worse well respected doc talking reinfection he's one see, reports often include 2nd infection worse first. Let's hope they're outliers, due immunopathology rather reinfection Dr. Griffen particular extremely reliable source information way ahead curve quite often. Texas also moving patients hospital hospital can't handle flow. lot counties western part state share single hospital large facilities. What's surprising happened huge medical facilities around Houston.  

As propaganda aspect 'triage' agree used tool, would add unless traumatized doctors lying, occur. Hopefully happen US. I'm sure we'd hear legal issues, certain state oversight boards asked medical community 'triage' guidelines. kind sick fuck would glad? You‚Äôre fucking gross. Bangkok required mask entering months some, all. look increase flu deaths year year. Unfortunately, *lots* people less half brain, sure little have. wtf üòÇ Sadly, reality politically unacceptable power solution national lockdown state support ordinary people safety net. fear (rightly) people understand social democracy supposed party cease exist. Sadly, alternative mass death crippled economy going for. Yeah, got people's explanations thread. playing idea massive public-facing company one heard of. everyone wore masks beginning hospitalization rate would lower, healthcare providers would need less long run. something similar next week state, hoping see double meteor shower better views comet. heard guy firefighter Hamilton, Ontario, Canada said ‚Äúbullshit‚Äù, cancel trucks yo. So, let‚Äôs say vaccinate 70% world population order reach herd immunity.

How long would take produce, distribute attribute 6 billion vaccine doses world? joke..
 even attempt ethics. Problem sounds like tourist shops probably tourists. Belgians recieved relief spending money chocolate tapestry jewelry shops trust area. Thank you! Remember half us voted keep things same, half voted leave 100 different ideas meant many saw protest vote. worst us yet come end year, we're fucked Covid ""Brexit Heroes"" fucking overseas (James Dyson, instance). Even PM's dad trying get EU citizenship himself, fearless leaders bothered rules us commoners. terrible time, 11 hectare lorry park built service one port try cope additional red tape created (whilst told getting rid EU red tape...see works?). really need love, let assure many us never felt European moment referendum result came in! So, seeing positive numbers like been, deaths really prevalent several months first postive test, new deaths potentially late April/May. case, expect deaths follow line increase exponentially? almost immediately, data funneled trump, problem disappear, magic tHaT's rAciSt!!!! Welcome Georgia people like continue rail idea herd immunity? It‚Äôs like bad word around here. It‚Äôs real thing. It‚Äôs basis vaccines work. dont believe herd immunity also don‚Äôt believe vaccines. Serious question, think Arizona past peak? seems deaths dropping numbers plateaued. obviously nuance bodies store process food, eat less calories consume... lose weight time. 

There‚Äôs possible outcome. can‚Äôt make something nothing, yes, it‚Äôs still laws thermodynamics. Yep, everything wrong everything went wrong *chant* We're #1! Right! shitshow college NFL attempt season year! That‚Äôs unlikely. total percentage US deaths autopsied US fell 19% dead 8% 1972 2007 continued dropping less 5%. state‚Äôs total deaths spike unexpectedly high, quickly, run morgue drawers hospitals space mortuaries crematoriums. Can‚Äôt store corpses closet long. Total deaths causes around country 19% higher normal spring May, it‚Äôs worse now. it‚Äôs 5% higher New Hampshire 30% higher Texas, Texas runs body storage space.  Well doubt people midwest eating dinner patios seven degrees outside. many regular people ICU vs Covid ICU? make sense hospitals re-opened, sick people would appear? Would could, homie. North Carolina state tug war democrats republicans whether take seriously. ICU, hospital bed use, cases rising. ""Reopening"" paused rapid case growth shows terrible idea. Masks required republicans fighting many sheriffs/police organizations desire enforce it. Mask compliance getting better still enough. Schools given options next semester, allowed conduct classes online desire. Boo hoo poes Well likely **way more** died yesterday. 

We won‚Äôt hear another 2-4 weeks. now?

Apparently sit reckoning sad reality married conspiratorial idiots. want live world people asthma protected exposure corona, yeah. sure kind grocery store employees person‚Äôs shopping they‚Äôre immunocompromised.

Do realize insane sound? You‚Äôre mad people want protect plague. dare care wellbeing, monsters. hardly 2nd shutdown. Sure businesses forced close there's way still instead chilling home, Hell casinos still open! heard someone say ‚Äúboth men need put aside differences greater good‚Äù

What horseshit. pettiness Trump time. Fauci always differences set aside, hasn‚Äôt stoked bullshit. 

Of course can‚Äôt sell horserace purebred donkey see need completely lie make things seem two-sided. call ""conservative.""

Use right word: ""Regressive."" virus keeps showing frightening day. wide range long takes, states like Florida Texas still adding deaths May. 

And like everything else, probably takes long deaths are. I've following park news I'm Disney fan see, Disney done great job installing ton social distance markers plexiglass barriers. also pretty serious mask requirements staff enforcing them.

There still issues Hollywood Studio crowds distancing, picture taken from, park layout. circular, laid like studio lot lots alleys dead-ends, ton popular rides. rare number isolated incidents parks, many. Rain challenge, people tend crowd covered areas, rains lot Florida.

So general, Disney good job make safe. still going theme park ground zero global pandemic, WTF??? GOP govs really trying out-asshole They'd also stop parties going bars. We're failing much rapidly right though. like football game opposing coach finds weaknesses exploits Look UK see happens terrible delayed initial response, mostly right things. New polls Yakima report 95% mask compliance Maybe rust bucket That's story. Neighbors three bouncy houses summer already; 10 cars driveway every weekend. Safe enough sit back porch, though! We've seemingly plateaued around 20% positive mark time being, better 28-30% seeing, silver linings guess? 

I really hoping start see % positive rate start gradual decline next 2-3 weeks far Arizonans wearing masks post-city/county mandate (also Walmart Kroger finally mandating help well). 

Obviously continue mask holdouts they're simply stay, even 80% people wearing public outings see decrease spread. problem lies within managers make dumb rules. Yeah well generation infection thought could turn bioweapons without hurting themselves. Must kill poor people. Interesting! hadn‚Äôt thought that. live Port Angeles cases rising here. get control paper government suppresses numbers reported. Per capita, AZ MS already way worse NY. testing much would lower cases, therefore higher fatality rate. 

I think that's point would imply deadly virus previously thought. people testing positive deaths stay same, mean fatality rate lower? wild receive propaganda related news one reddits biggest propaganda accounts good lesson people now--but hard blame got sick months ago. many even wearing masks then? April sites predicted peak deaths etc. simply possible lock downs place? curious projections FL don‚Äôt think many actually know this. news basically reported ‚ÄúFlorida makes good progress reporting backlog COVID deaths.‚Äù way report ‚Äú156 people died COVID yesterday.‚Äù Ah shit replying wrong comment. Thank taking precautions stated. funniest thing I've ever read internet! wish America could wake nightmare. political system massive failure could stop epic disaster happening. Super appreciate local perspective - thanks. South Africa slapping COVID cause death majority death certificates. literally LAZIEST country earth. pretty corrupt to. Also, pretty horrible spoilt brat rides fame fathers legacy. Lol, what? Otherwise people hypothyroidism gain weight without gain weight without meds lose meds.

Except medication hypothyroidism increases metabolism increases calories out... lose weight meds means calories officially less calories out. Hello /u/rick6787 , stop beating wife? raped sister?

Stopping messages lies censorship. That's said pro chaos. Yes, world worked way pre-covid, bad press would bad GOP. fact seem care telling. sure act like people concerned re-election...

How many people take run election? many workers volunteers? many people volunteer indoors crowds people falling dead streets? many postal workers sick simultaneously around nation? election even possible thousands thousands people ill time? anticipate election, way used to, fall. see possible.  Username checks Good - city mandates enforced anyways. See: cellphone-driving bans. RIP, need provide best protection frontiers. Phase 1 safety. efficacy. may choose report seconadry end points required to. 

What think said that's incorrect?  country stole testing. can‚Äôt right pesky checks balances, blue wave start dismantle them. Yes is, virtual learning. questions one answer

1. teacher even slightly ill stay home feel better, get negative covid test, go work (which teachers past).
2. teacher gets sick cover classes, develop curriculum, etc. substitutes.
3. outbreak school close everyone gets tested? parents even send children back?
4. many outbreaks district take parents stop sending kids? Bad bot gonna hospitals soon. local news announced moving nursing main hospitals running covid beds. Doubling weekly take long overwhelm them.

City fifty thousand state rarely makes national news. Finally good news! GOP psychopathic, checks out. Hire college students young people Teacher‚Äôs Aides.

Lmao teacher licensing certification? r/Coronavirus popping bottles That's surprisingly appropriate image put head.  It‚Äôs unreal someone built multi billion dollar media empire starting fucking ridiculous goofy. anyone know he‚Äôs always made stupid fucking sounds? Thanks! anyone remember January? good old ‚Äúbefore times‚Äù?

It‚Äôs slowly fading memory. stable genius think so. everyone didn‚Äôt doesn‚Äôt take COVID seriously, sincere FUCK Good thing two those... think. live Washington. situation western part state close began lifting restrictions. part, people still conscientious using masks maintaining distance. Western Washington Eastern Washington like two different states, though. Eastern WA different political landscape far people buy conspiracy theories much selfish less community-minded. surprising Yakima hit hard, unfortunately. hospitals can‚Äôt send data CDC, still send states? sure good news bad news. think management don‚Äôt think would really possible current laws charge people, definitely need new laws moving forward would put Ron Desantis Brian Kemp prison insanity. sad part (aside fact Florida's government actively trying shove mess rug instead trying clean up) STILL really bad positive rate even trying water healthcare workers even close retiring 60‚Äôs. know nurses 70‚Äôs still working away.

Also, grandparents! people grandparents? grandmother died 64 old all.  what's gain this? Where‚Äôs taint? I'm immunocompromised also staying in. sucks, watch video someone struggling breathe read another dozen healthcare workers dying, put big girl panties stop whining. year restaurants, movies, shopping etc. kill anyone. Covid might. less 2 days apart, California close finish line much momentum get first. Even assuming Florida stays insanely high rate change due hit 412,000 cases 6.8 days, California mosey 5.5 days. Even California completely plateaus here, they'll reach 412,000 6.3 days.

Even Usain Bolt can't beat Bob accounting Bob starts 70 meter line. good news: oblivious it. Bad news: we're not. Covid answered question speak preferences. beginning think asked bad faith order proselytize.. Already answered someone else.

But honestly whole mask thing ends public nudity movement leftist cities months wearing masks.

But like said elsewhere big difference exposing privates potentially minors children exposed minor benefit mask brings (unless people actually start wearing good masks) going HHS. people stole PPE. downvote Eveline. downvoted you, comments history. Front line victim. spend shit tons time here. Never seen anything like that. Post proofs bullshitting.

Fix problems first, speak.

You're moron:  criticism bizarre failed outline kind effective strategy minimize deaths/suffering. ""We'll eradicate getting everyone wear masks"" plan force everyone obey you. Americans notorious hostile towards government mandates, even meant helpful. kind strategy must take account. 

""Lock everything months"" work, US public simply unwilling pay economic costs approach.

Knowing behavioral changes semi-lockdowns (the kind accept back April) effective alone, understanding effects immunity play complementary role here. Unfortunately, said things display ignorance concept herd immunity.

For part, give pass since kind thing happens rarely, really shone light blind spot science. next years present great opportunity study pandemic hopefully help minimize next one. honest really shutdown 2 weeks everyone really afraid. essential workers allowed work essentially everyone. even traffic jams middle lockdowns. nutshell. happened New York happened Italy. Yeah posts 5 months think masks, Taiwan, etc. wrong friend go get find out! know ppl twice already .. believe bullshit herd immunity, fantasy ..this virus mutates quickly keep mutating infection rates sore. Unattainable herd immunity lol Dengue twice too.

The troubling thing Daniel‚Äôs case person much ill second time. People grew tired partners?  worry, Government took numbers told America go fuck worried reality anymore. wait? local Target (San Jose, CA) requiring masks since March. hard do. Show love neighbors wear mask. Faith humanity starting get restored ü§£ report old also say undercounted, said estimated excess deaths. see multiple reports (by NYT FT example) excess deaths correspond well Sweden reported might even slightly reporting. comparison statistics deaths ones based death certificate Socialstyrelsen (most recent report here: ) actually show lower number one reported FHM, even though include people diagnosed COVID tested earlier days. Days later, June 27, said mom started feel sick. two days, said Papadimitriou unable find place get tested COVID-19. 

This currently situation now. places within 50 miles appointment appointments booked well next week Right? back fucking March?  anti masker wearing mask, get it. Put money mouth go ICU local hospital treating covid-19 without mask. Temp screens door, required masks 6ft rule already standard practice. extra step accomplish? even remotely paying attention, know symptoms know come sick. willing ignore that, what's stop someone simply lying? agree. governor says necessary wear masks wants state reopen, sending kids back school, cancel refrigerated trucks. Let deal dead streets believe dragged houses executed lawns voters lost someone. way going, January, everyone US directly affected this. really good thread (by statistician linking good reading think many people sub read).

 

I PhD immunology apparently feelings subject would get called ""denier"" around here. data reinfection tenuous best way early make conclusions long immunity last (though seen evidence immunity somewhat lasting, though timeframe still unclear).

Prevalence something news =/= prevalence clinic. Wait peer reviewed research, anecdotal reports. we‚Äôll never know it. hope please! need fight strongly. Jean Luc Picard always Captain. Fauci always ship‚Äôs chief medical officer. propose assholes hold state wide camp 14 days one location huddled together protest anti-mask rights. 

Call anti-mask safe zone. peacefully protest, one out, including medical personnel, 14 days prove masks needed virus spread. üòà North Carolina. 30% rule kidding? health crisis worsened for-profit health systems. needs fundamentally change, Patty. cannot uninsured people worried looming threat losing life livelihood. isn‚Äôt soapbox gloating? fact *all* Americans deserve healthcare? find ridiculous we‚Äôre entering elections candidates complicit denying healthcare people. need consider this; especially (not if) next pandemic rolls around. need prepared needs equity.

Yeah fuck whiny little bitches won‚Äôt wear them. Lol get air today. Viral load? got think does.

I'm guessing it's:

Weakens credibility. shows patient age shifted younger people infected Well could. arn't that's people mad at. they're conflicting, half ""media"" outlets probably bullshit.

I coworker tell article reading CDC saying masks ineffective covid. surprised, kept open mind, thinking I'd find similar article end day-I feel like would big news.

Not 10 minutes later run across article stating director CDC saying everyone masked we'd covid knocked within 4-6 weeks. even video saying it! asked coworker news came video right director CDC supposedly contradicting organization. answer. said ""I know 'they' got from."" bother asking ""they"" knew bullshit. says want politically incorrect conservative? hearing right? end video Dude. get tear gassed could kill me. medical issues tear gas would put hospital, im trans doctor like let die they're allowed here.

what fuck? focusing Fauci means attempt discredit instead realizing entire task force including Pence behind statement. sub full anti-US propaganda. It‚Äôs blatantly obvious. hope mean emigration plans. rather Damn degens upcountry. know moment US people still debate mask issue. 

I could understand someone values money economic life badly want reopen business see anyone would object masks moment. literally everything else mainstream media saying?

Maybe one two cups coffee minimum one gallon water sometimes sometimes two maybe more. wet masks really make lot harder breathe. adds nice extra bit heat blast back face you‚Äôre breathing hard. sweating nothing new. I‚Äôve job years thing changed mask. question remains is: population allow continue...

The answer Yes. everything that's happened, including limited horrendous coronavirus response, still gives Trump 40% approval rating, means become ignorant uneducated anything it. thought we've already banned traveling lot countries thanks shitty response? Absolutely, money. work scientific research company groups keeping research secrets one another first publish within company. Hilarious, next article article subreddit story lady left house months except go store, went used gloves mask, kid infected.....lol One inherent advantage region population density really low help u updates regarding mask acceptance n usage nordics far? still reluctant?

No one saying coronavirus hoax, least certainly not.  


But saying date found alarming? People upset Trump administration hospitals send data HHS instead CDC upset there's clearly malintent reporting negative test results? really saying that, way shape, form, fashion, reporting negative cases changes local efforts combat virus? 


If show positive results, data help anyone? Sounds like skewing data. Stats matter, especially virus. 


To use another analogy, talking sports calculating Lebron Jame's free-throws, say hit 100% counted ones made in. That's absolute madness see problem that. Quite bit, I'm willing let go possessions start fresh. Germany perfect almost anywhere better states right now. Yes.

Are going hit ""Dying Corona"" vs. ""Dying Corona"" argument lol?

Anyway, enough compare neighboring countries. Even disregard deaths elderly care homes Sweden (your favorite scape goat), twice many deaths rest Scandinavia *combined*.

Great success eh? list stores nation wide? already happening.

 **Sweden \* corona pandemic affected high school results negatively, according preliminary grade statistics National Agency Education.** 
**- remember learning goes long time, says Peter Fredriksson, director general National Agency Education.** 

The proportion ninth-graders eligible upper secondary school year 85.3 per cent, compared last year's 84.3 per cent.

In addition, high school students taken student within three years. 2019, 76.6 percent high school students managed take student within three years, year's results show increase 78.1 percent.

\- gratifying result really surprised. several years seen good results measurements, says Peter Fredriksson National Agency Education TT.

The educations proportion increase children leisure program, HVAC real estate program nationally recruiting educations degree objectives.

## Feeling anxious

A good collaboration students teachers enabled Swedish students perform maintain good learning environment corona pandemic, Fredriksson believes.

\- One must also remember learning takes place long time begins even primary school. would strange shorter period distance education negative effect results, says.

But Peter Fredriksson says worried whether pandemic last long time consequences may affect students negatively.

\- know students greatly affected social life home conditions. Sweden suffers high unemployment economic crisis, may negative effect students, says.

## Worse results

The preliminary statistics also show less bright sides. proportion students year six receive approved semester grade subjects decreased 0.7 percentage points previous academic year.

Minister Education Anna Ekstr√∂m (S) believes early draw conclusions result.

\- government allowed great deal flexibility ensured graduate six close knowledge gaps six also autumn term seventh even spring term seventh, says adds:

\- case principals used resources way ensured students ninth grade received support need able move - think wise priority.  #Translation:

More Swedes traveling across Norwegian border Norway eased restrictions.

But aware quarantine rules.

Today, Norway eased rules citizens allowed enter country. Swedes Blekinge, Sk√•ne Kronoberg allowed travel Norway without quarantined. Swedes, living so-called red zones, also allowed enter must ten-day quarantine.

The Norwegian police months monitored border Norway Sweden Riksgr√§nsen . today increased flow Swedes want enter neighboring country.

According rules, anyone enters way must prove sit quarantine.


- difficult say exactly how, be, example, hotel booking. understanding one place ten days, denied entry. Swedes' duty show it, clear plan cannot explain us stay, difficult us believe say.

I'd like believe true, U.S. already country quite bit masking yet developed world's worst epidemic.

First thing needs done Ohio... give Dr. Amy Acton whatever wants return director health. Bullshit. I‚Äôm sick sneeze open air,.. moisture particles germs, etc much would either get breathed people, land surfaces etc. 

Thats masks prevent. September approval coming sometime October. He‚Äôs trying get Donald‚Äôs. Florida 20-22 million people UK 65ish million people gives fuck putin?!?!?! virus ravaging country.

we roughly 250k new cases daily, would run infections run trails? almost way neighbors catch terms death disability toll. Read [this article depth needed, pretty obvious point. already new treatments hey might even get vaccine soon (I remain skeptical possible). 

We're also seeing increasing evidence legitimate sources Dr. Daniel Griffen TWiV. Many times ""reinfections"" severe. may also kind immunopahtology (I think unprecedentedly) delayed multiphasic infection tbf.

It always risky gamble unlikely pay (and therefore ALWAYS wrong strategy ethically speaking: play people's lives like without full informed consent), potential payoff seems incredibly unlikely. seems likely given data coming ""herd disability"" herd immunity. 

We agree also dick move re: neighbors pretty upset large. 

When medical experiment shows working treatment (supresion / Test, Trace, Isolate case) control group disbanded given said treatment compassionate grounds. get intellectual level, humane level done unethical. well respected experts even called [human rights Sad world live info shared whole world screwed point. time work together get safe effective vaccine asap forget politics. Yeah couldn‚Äôt rally support outside base ran shit campaign lost. Don‚Äôt sit soapbox gloat we‚Äôre health crisis. Another reason tiktok bane humanity.

Well, whistle blowers aren‚Äôt protected... bound happen know businesses PA reverting back WFH eased know time. Judging online defense troll, already obtained herd immunity - facts reason... state (Wisconsin) screwed state GOP sued overturned governor‚Äôs plan. completely controlled anti-intellectual GOP even though Dem Governor. guess comes back Trump though, state GOP lackeys carrying whole following science agenda promoted Trump. mediabiasfactcheck.com: Overall, rate Technocracy.News far-right tin foil hat Conspiracy site promotes quackery level pseudoscience. also rate Low factual reporting due routine publication false information evidenced numerous failed fact checks. idea viral load-Covid severity started Chinese doctors making observation. Also, important arguments supporting mask wearing, masks certainly prevent high viral load exposure general. moron election day.  Remember U.S. worst case 100k deaths total? Worst case based solely know now. completely possible month, ""worst case"" project could better, could worse Meanwhile, still arguing masks US. don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs reinfection recrudescence. reports isolated. virus long enough see happening frequently. Trump cannot bear he's focus, that's it. It‚Äôs rhetorical question. US, government insist wear clothes public, regardless whether localities choose so. That's need make effort praise this, can't let antimaskers make louder fuss. Call local Walmart thank management upholding policy. Seriously, idea happy make day giving simple compliment. know chief, aren‚Äôt ‚Äúwiping everything down‚Äù. Cast members aren‚Äôt trained/paid sanitize rides, apparently it‚Äôs Disney‚Äôs ‚Äúbudget‚Äù so. good info, thanks!

so 2/3rd's 1.5 weeks, little 1/3 1.5+ weeks. 

Of course, states worse that, better. I'm guessing AZ, FL, TX perhaps CA currently worse that, partially due increase numbers, that's good info. really sure mean. Sweden Norway Demark, yeah, guess did. Really? virtually every country Europe Asia better didn‚Äôt intentionally lie people. That‚Äôs REEEEEEEALLY low bar. 

Fauci much blood hands everyone else US administration. People STILL insisting masks don‚Äôt work based campaign disinformation back then. how‚Äôs anyone know they‚Äôre telling truth lying then, vs. telling truth lying now? That‚Äôs lying people destructive. Everyone second guess try read everything say. old trump defence. think may hit something may real difference maker, unions. wife's unions utterly disappointing. true? that‚Äôs case horrifying news. **It's really hard private sector step government prevents business.** lol I've got feeling try use ""things improving"" based reported weekends narrative least two weeks. think it‚Äôs perhaps media pretty quiet Russia. I'm obese (I'm little overweight, trying get shape atm) agree several doctors handled obesity pandemic downplayed ""patient morbidly obese perfectly healthy!!"", remember someone posting article r/COVID19 written ""doctor"" said 100% healthy girl died covid-19 (I'm exactly sure think part family party several members died, overweight) kept reading later said obese, local newspaper city published article day saying healthy 27 year old died heavily implying killing perfectly healthy young adults really often yet again, stated said person obese, wake call obesity healthy, know hard lose weight I'm proud anyone who's taking lockdowns tool get healthier. 


I live M√©xico obesity diabetes one main reasons big death toll, US, half people overweight lot think virus real. Thank you! frustrating come sub try explain non-controversial get downvoted hell, effectively silences me.

If questioned ANYTHING media industrial complex reported us (I include right left-wing media camps complex) would realize government (and media) catering upper-class told lower-class (read: poor, disease-ridden rednecks immigrants) coming them.

*You better wearing mask deliver Amazon packages, I'll ruin fucking life.* Insurance agent feel sorry client. Like said, patients radiation treatment postponed hight pandemic treatment would make vulnerable covid-19, since immune system would severely compromised treatment. difficult ‚Äúdamned do, damned don‚Äôt‚Äù situation patients world in. 

The decrease detected cases global phenomenon people avoided going doctor covid-19, unique Sweden. Authorities repeatedly stressed people still go doctor need pandemic. capacity diagnose illness throughout pandemic.

I cancer know well suffering waiting treatment, don‚Äôt presume don‚Äôt care that. also work Stockholm hospital system know inside well coped non-emergency care.  WH spent effort fighting fauci corona virus actually fighting corona virus times ""child sized"" used non sad way. think it‚Äôs cause didn‚Äôt know scope going happen potential alternative solutions since first get hit. Wasn‚Äôt 70k last week? tried everything could think ran ideas tried backwards every retailer piles on, Monday's Karening going grow ever larger. virus unified us made country divided weaker ever. ""You¬†stood¬†on the¬†shoulders¬†of geniuses accomplish something fast could, even knew had, patented it, packaged it, slapped plastic lunchbox, wanna sell it.""

 - Dr Ian Malcolm love ‚Äúit‚Äôs joke!‚Äù excuses assholes always seem make. 

...shouldn‚Äôt funny, then? sure north border? seem shit together there. forgot part ""they"" say he's best pilot.

Who ""they"" anyway?? laughing now? There‚Äôs War Science going long time. Rush Limbaugh thirty years. main crisis far it‚Äôs gotten terms driving response science-based problems. Treating like Olympics see... really stupid argument. Huge difference exposing pecker people ages mask. already know response ""not wearing mask assault people germs like wearing undies assaulting people privates"" something like sure.

But sadly one people try make. Thus go leftwing cities might see 60 year old dudes pecker.

Most places stick free nipple campaigns though. thing November. trump think vote keep destroying nursing homes &amp; older risk populations? He‚Äôs legend mind Oh yeah, I'm aware governments doing, amazes they're incompetent.

I cant even imagine PM local government making pandemic political event. goal protect citizens, circlejerk stupid talking points. party canada would thoroughly lambasted tried. Mental illness compounded extreme opioid use? Ofcourse questioned. I'm means saying blindly follow considering amount shit white house said Trump consistently downplaying virus quite frankly last people criticising him. little background:

- Tuesday Greece closed operating land border point people without valid COVID test paper number cases coming reached worrying levels 

- Greece reinstating weekly live briefing nation regarding state virus country. insisting 'business measure' related increase cases.

- almost seemingly eliminating community transmission, orphaned cases popping everywhere. Yesterday one Island Paros. previous day summer camp Halkidiki.

- Almost measures followed islands. Shoulder-to-shoulder summer parties going ahead use masks rare.

- legal mandate wear mask indoors (aside public transport) mask use seems dropped dramatically million years see happening ........ :/ lol Good 'ol Donnie said better straighten else stopped responsible governor fell back line GOP governors. Unfortunately. leadership actually great, stubborn faculty good union :)

I‚Äôm sad state public education strongly believe in, care deeply career. keep fighting good fight. Antibodies reduced rates expected (antibodies always go down). Immunity still thought long enough vaccine stomp out. confirmed reinfections 6 months think lot best alternative options expensive, especially willing commit long term, always challenging schools operate within budget. 

Like think would interesting see model huge high schools 4,000+ students split smaller ""home room"" groups 10-15 students group either met rented house, families willing step host home room groups. group would ""home room teacher"" expert instructing material, could teach subjects could facilitate remote instruction conference calls specialized topics like language science whatever. would still risk teacher, exposed 10-15 students total course whole year would less risky exposed 100+ students class every day, plus bunch kids halls, even though inevitably kids would always social distancing outside school, would avoid lot physical interactions kids otherwise interact outside school. would allow parents work day kids stay home. one kid gets sick, easier quarantine individual home room group versus quarantine different people student would come contact course typical school day. need UBI higher minimum wage parents want stay home kids can. could free space daycare kids single parents parents want work. doubt anything store cannot procured somewhere else. keep ‚Äòhumor‚Äô I‚Äôll keep money pocket. probably graduated scale: make pay $20 make &lt;20k/year pay $850. ‚ÄúIts joke‚Äù

Whats funny part then? 700 extra murders suicides heart attacks every day. Sure, refuse wear masks, open everything early, cry it. Reagan put way much blind faith capitalism. 

Reagan build 1%. lapdog to
GE Elite Southern California. dubious math.

Lol expertise say this. Go watch legend. suggestion would good indicator. even better indicator would divide deaths closed cases, cases longer active - ones led recovery death. best measurement years data fully analyzed. comment isn‚Äôt correct. 1.4% fatality rate cases low 1.4% fatality rate cases high, data. 1.4 percent 1.4 percent. time number cases would effect fatality rate high would impede hospital resources (which Florida approaching now). They're going provide masks one. probably takes bit set up. long take find long virus doesnt live surface? thats ""using new evidence"" change view point. thats either straight lying, incompetent cant find long lives surface.... thats crazy cause one fact used cudgel force businesses shut down. either lied messed up, finally FLIP FLOPPED said doesnt live surfaces near long thought. mean lie (masks dont matter) flip flop, shame me. lie twice (the virus lives DAYS steel surfaces) shame would trust again? also remember doctors youtube getting removed saying lockdowns werent justified science, got removed. hard know whats actually going on. want sides, one guy clearly DOESNT represent doctors, ones want represent aka agree.  unfortunate stoked opposition.

At beginning pandemic CDC saying wear masks, needed health care professionals

At time, efficacy non-medical masks unknown. proof existed cloth non-medical masks effective prevention, conspiracy theorists ran it.

The truth is, information offered best information time. best information changes new information available. 

The facts become irrefutable: masks work. go Newmarket get mine. remember lineup, maybe risk group, seem recall available general public straight away. awl da clams eat! predict many crushing restrictions ease soon Orange loses. still small number since india huge ass country.

per capita case rate still way lower countries. Some? 5.4 million people lost insurance pandemic. only.... .... had.... Presidential candidate .... advocating public healthcare U.S. ..... hmmm. Well suppose bring jobs back faster win amazing numbers... Weird... thought first country complete human trials ""successfully."" need fine me, I'll jerking freezer rest afternoon. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre five moves ahead Loser Chess. top 1000 5000 deaths per day I'm talking layoffs food lines man. coronavirus? Maybe. literally every aspect life health? Yes. least morons still Food Lion, now. I'm treating child refused touch stove. parents told it. Yet still went touched. Learned lesson hard way kid. moron life get approved sometime early next year. Oh yeah! believe that. So, covid.

While know causing it, guess harmful chemicals foods hygiene products overuse plastic prevalent developed societies. demonstrates herd immunity probably pipe dream.

Friendly reminder vaccination causes herd immunity. robot? never even mentioned word masks. even talking about? way reaches numbers. predict 1 gazillion dead next month.

In Denmark recently told people basically 'you wear mask go get COVID test also hand case. Also wear CAN'T socially distance'. 

[This article Danish NYT Politiken run G translate prepare silly errors lol:

Health analysis: Danish Health Medicines Authority recommends use face masks public spaces four specific situations. beginning normalization view recommendation face masks Denmark, writes Politiken's health editor.


Prediction: half year, healthy citizens wear bandages supermarkets, public transport special indoor premises places poor ventilation.

Cause: Increasing knowledge still enigmatic coronavirus also spread via hanging microparticles air, bandages provide possible extra protection.

Background: Thursday, Danish Health Medicines Authority opened door ajar, large parts world already torn open. Danish Health Medicines Authority encourages Danes buy small stock mouthpieces.

In four specific situations, Danish health authorities believe makes good sense use bandage:

  ill / infected need break self-isolation transported hospital.
  way home self-isolation traveling high-risk area abroad.
  you, close contact infected person, break self-insulation transport test site.
  relative cannot keep distance person special risk, need help personal care, example. 

It seem like innocent obviously good places wear bandage risk infecting others.

When announcement National Board Health nevertheless sensational, board long refused recommend use masks among healthy people public space. seen Asia increasingly also European countries North America.

In Germany, example, everyone wear masks supermarkets public transport, UK introduced mask obligation public transport. Since April, Austria, Slovenia, Czech Republic Turkey required wear masks parts public space, French Academy Health recommends wearing masks.

In United States, Center Disease Control Prevention recommends wearing mask bandage going places difficult respect general distance rules.
WHO changes mind

The published June updated recommendation use face masks, countries consider use face masks special situations. precisely Danish Health Medicines Authority starting tighten bandages Danes despite previous reluctance. board also emphasizes healthy citizens continue move public space without use bandages.

The Danish authorities' reluctance generally recommend bandages healthy public space, contrast western countries, primarily due three factors: culture, unsafe use evidence.

It created certain pride corona epidemic quickly came control Denmark, society reopened, without pressure infection increased - without use masks achieve goal.

The Danes' clean hands ability keep distance got virus fought without alienating eerie-looking mask, would marked change dealings fragile fellow citizens could become even insecure anxious.

The health authorities also believed face masks provide false sense security, part cause coronavirus-infected people enter society - . one hand, lead less physical distance, provide false security, increase reduce risk infection, incorrect use increase risk infection.

Therefore, National Board Health made booklet correct use bandages.

Last least, Danish health authorities previously found convincing professional evidence overall health gain achieved efforts covid-19, cover mouth nose public space.
Maybe virus hanging air

Precisely professional position increasingly challenged globally.

Until now, international professional position virus-infected droplets able infect within 1-2 meters distance fall ground. wash hands contacts. keep distance. That's sneeze.

But scientists increasingly opened eyes fact new coronavirus may - - transmitted via microscopic airborne particles, so-called aerosols, infection spread much greater distances remains suspended air longer otherwise thought.

This week, 237 scientists published journal Clinical Infectious Diseases doctors health authorities around world must recognize new coronavirus also transmitted airborne viruses .

Most surprisingly, reject idea ‚Äã‚Äãactually airborne covid infection press conference Tuesday week.

""We need open evidence understand implications ways viruses transmitted, well precautions taken,"" said Benedetta Allegranzi, Technical Director Communicable Diseases Working Group. according Nature .

She also stated actually issue new guidelines infection environments close contact poor ventilation .

There's someone competent, honest intelligent Trump administration.  I'm surprised lasted long. Trying voice reason shit storm insanity. know numbers.

But also BDE too. guy oversaw election?

Seems legit. parents left everything behind come States young understand why.

Judging average going back bit they've time enter correct date death seems around 10 deaths / day (which still way high). 
So see point conversion, display real accuracy. probably can't really drop things like masking distancing rules unless virus gone good really edge treatment. Definitely that.

That said, none stopping states reporting data. think pretty much every state COVID site that's run Department Health. states get first crack data, CDC collects there. certainly true cases deaths, believe hospitalizations too. 

I think new private collection company going put skewed data, anyone wants believe site state sites plentiful aggregate sites accurately tracking numbers along, likely looking CDC guidance begin with... Straight plot Designated Survivor Season 3. total failure US government.

Blame fucks, Americans.  Also pushing schools open going end way pushing reopen soon - disaster. keep targeting going get better anytime soon. Alright, understand rationale behind question itself. ask... pose response comment? I'm literally point think pixeleyes misunderstood crankywhisper's comment.

Only thing maybe could change believing imo deaths know death bed.

Sorry poor english... Well yeah. thousands hospitals whose collective data results numbers CDC receives shares. Certain hospitals may share data publicly mean get accurate numbers HHS unless every hospital releases numbers publicly. F Wow. we‚Äôll never able get COVID control without strict enforcement place. every single one deserves get COVID. bff seems like fun guy, dark humor Danish speciality lol. Also, herd immunity still Swedish strategy. Linking old comments change  isn‚Äôt idea. max limit range actuary tables, know median age death 80. people average health effecting, 8 years life stolen average. However, know likely kill poor health begin with, know less 8 years average, don‚Äôt know much less.
Plus know fatality rate per case .6 percent. know enough put figure within fairly narrow range.
I hear though, C-19 might effect quality life even recovering, ignoring obesity also effects quality life reduces abilities decades average person death. specifically, reduce population Florida.

Traffic volume almost approaching pre-COVID levels. Remember Trump said, ‚ÄúI knew ISIS generals do?‚Äù

Well, belief knows experts wasn‚Äôt limited military. lot us would welcome ~~open arms.~~ SIX FEET DISTANCE pretty easy ignore insults well known moron. Ah makes sense. decision likely complex based that. Latest hackers using spear-phishing malware target U.S., British Canadian hackers attempting steal coronavirus vaccine research, U.S., British Canadian governments said Thursday, opening dangerous new front cyberwars intelligence battles Moscow National Security Agency said APT29, hacking group known Cozy Bear associated Russian intelligence, taking advantage chaos created coronavirus pandemic targeting health care organizations seeking steal intelligence vaccines, Julian E. Barnes Russian hackers targeting British, Canadian American organizations researching vaccines Covid-19. hackers using spear-phishing malware try get access condemn despicable attacks vital work combat coronavirus pandemic,‚Äù said Paul Chichester, director operations Britain‚Äôs National Cyber Security Center. Nahh, Trump vote nullify liability corporations, kill consecquence.  love Trump insists calling China flu STILL. Sadly Americans spreading virus country now, surely world thinks American virus. Can‚Äôt wait see history books say one Norwegians, Danes, Finns traveling Sweden. Basic logic anyone's forte. hate Russia. similar story happened small town Ontario. happened Minden 4000 people. Guy assaults another guy asked wear mask, leads police chase, gets shot. Nah, real question obsessive? mean, EVERY thread Sweden, commenting obsessively bad Sweden is. 
You seem Swedish, what's weird fixation? That's thing admire guy. could retire enjoy last years peace chooses deal orange reality tv star listen nonsense. nothing respect Dr. Fauci anyone deserves retirement guy. Yes, great continue policy instead relaxing it.  stealing information pointed out, Blekinge small region (it stands 1.5% Swedish people). shouldnt affect overall result much. Sk√•ne Halland stand 1.7 mio Swedes (17%) planned interrupt self-testing. Can't wait give world. /s much feds give again? Garbage airline Neither made testing. example, vaccines kinds coronaviruses caused two recent deadly epidemics ‚Äî MERS SARS ‚Äî took longer 18 months develop, **neither made way approval process**.

Scientists already head-start, thanks years research potential coronavirus vaccines, still plenty necessary obstacles. One pertinent that¬†some prominent candidates¬†for coronavirus vaccine using novel technology never used approved vaccine.

Some scientists worry rushed vaccine could result what's known ""enhancement"" whereby vaccine actually weakens person's response virus contract it. example, one study SARS vaccine 2004 [found ferrets developed hepatitis, rather resilience coronavirus. T-cell response also potentially protective. know protective though. Sure, fine. Clarification: herd immunity via infection. Wife ER doc. patient severe stroke symptoms refuse seen testing everyone. Left AMA take chance actively stroking believe virus I'm sure every country cyber intelligence capability this. surprise would weren't. alarming - data mistake. Please tell action taken Florida based positivity rate - zero. Absolutely nothing Florida coronavirus response plan linked number.

Now NY, linked school openings positivity rate, would concerning. Especially though counties throwing data attempt close schools.

But none that. Florida going Florida wants - keep businesses open cost. positivity rate changes 10 percent 8 16 14, pretty irrelevant.

We know locally nationally rising positivity rates, independent confirmation trends hospitalization rates death rates.

For mal intent, reaction data. DeSantis give two shits positivity rate. virus sucks, lot Canadians including also want visit United States. fault sorry, sad see virus south fuelled political agenda. Even quarantine still seems risky. know several people flew Vegas vacation Toronto last week driving to/from Windsor. enough people don‚Äôt. So.. Go fund USPS? service FedEx ballots appropriate destination? gotta end run kind here. 7.6 billion go! That's bold strategy, let's see plays out. I'm sure stores get much constant shit, employees want deal anymore. neighborhood Kroger's real serious sanitized carts, limited amount customers store, providing window immunocompromised persons beginning, much anymore. see less less faces worked literal years new teenager working everytime. mention look broken. :( people say virus killing old people, doesnt mean wealthy old white conservatives suburban communities etc. scary truth ramble wearing masks, doesnt mean they're ones suffering it. virus disproportionately killing minorities, especially blacks much likely vote democrat. wouldnt shocked strategy wipe ravage communities opposition voters GOP, they'll combine sabotaging USPS closing polls ensure enormous amounts dem votes suppressed November. They'll leave come stand line day alongside millions MAGA troops wearing masks hazing so, height probable second wave, top dem votes lost above, many find personal risk risk families loved ones great bother turning person let alone lasting whole day cast vote.

Here's article badly virus specifically killing minorities: smart way deter people. administration loves whip fake/mild controversy order distract larger controversy. ""works"" sense gets lot people stop talking important things (Roger Stone, lack federal COVID guidance, etc).   honestly think trump's way bolstering confederacy's plan give states power.

National emergency? Give federal responsibility, put power states hands. states getting devided without central government.

I smell civil war, guys. It‚Äôs huge income increase so.... Well middle July today anyday Anything CDC says ‚Äúfake news‚Äù half population. sad. Pro police violence friend infectious disease doctor, who, addition working private travel medicine practice, works free clinic sex workers local homeless population. safe say whole friend group gotten comfortable syphilis jokes. someone works Walmart, can‚Äôt even enforce employees wearing masks several Covid cases hit store. way going enforce customers wearing masks Monday. Let people make choices. COVID-19 affects elderly immune compromised. know people are, protect let rest population thing. Reopen everything put end mask mandate madness. watch last season stop there. imagine think end alot happier way. GOP falsify numbers think wise compare daily Covid death numbers per day mortality country. Populations different mortality due age distribution, overall health, much got fucked opioids sugar name ... I‚Äôd nervous flying you‚Äôre packed tube people long period time. n95 would definitely help. I‚Äôm flying unless required. Vitamin c supplements aren‚Äôt going help. won‚Äôt hurt like many supplements there‚Äôs lots conflicting/questionable conclusions benefit. Well let‚Äôs hope leak information viruses like HIV, hepatitis, mumps, HPV linked testes damage causes host COVID-19 attack human sperm leads build-up angiotensin II, hormone regulates kidney function blood pressure. Increased levels hormone cause immune response invading COVID-19 virus particles increases availability reactive oxygen species causes cell exposure elevated angiotenstin II levels lead cell death sperm.

Immune response lead damage testicles. COVID19 known permanently damage organs. First - anctidotal. 

Second - 14+ days ago? tested negative? no? K.

Third - bothered use parenthesis around ex girlfriend, frankly am... recall, around time Trump initially calling states open up, someone posted signs ""Free New York"" rally Staten Island. Note Staten Island Republican part New York City. Anyway, people showed cops assigned crowd control.

Staten Island also scene video woman tried shop grocery store without mask, yelled everyone else put fucking mask on.

We little politically motivated mask stuff. fraction younger ""relax chill"" idiots, though. weaker indeed spent 7months avoiding microbes Wow, exactly I've come expect Georgia. get rid ""customer always right"" assumption. huh goaled myself! legit thought neutral lol. Apologies! Nothing see here, cough along Here‚Äôs FB profile want chat comment section public posts. Take care yourself! I'm also grateful jcps first time life. I'm 30 always disappointed jcps since child. I'm amazed see actually put staff children first regardless threats idiot leader thrown them. guess doesnt know local taxes pay majority schools lol. Honestly, medical care monetized all, CERTAINLY data. Let‚Äôs real, battle bastards looked cool, writing weak Lol, say I'm one preaching.  saying wearing max beneficial it? nearly every medical professional planet. 

I'll never ever meet you, tell cunt Formal employment necessarily imply signed contract. verbal agreement, DK anyway. consult without contract want. Maybe Sweden rule rules rules culture different?  Gates actually worth $100B. ""overweight"" necessarily unhealthy moderately muscled. obese significantly different except odd extreme outlier. like reddit. GOP become party want see world burn? Ideally, can't even mandate simple masks without meltdowns, protests, literally murder. 
I think comes ""Don't tell do"" culture/mentality. sense losing kind control threatening alot people. 

The CDC could find eating cake helps fight Coronavirus say ""Everyone must enjoy slice cake effective immediately"" people would still flipping out. Nice, Ron.  Wow! I‚Äôve always thought woke american leftie wanting push Sweden failed agenda american internal politics.

Hadn‚Äôt pictured disgusting racist though. Good know.  Again, I'm talking patents. specific instance care patents. nefarious plan withhold vaccines people, fuck them. However question protected data first place. question medicine honestly, I'm stuck country monetized health care frustrating. Good call. people go though, think would worthwhile thread subreddit, least while. older relatives cautious, let up. one thing comforts bit. Can‚Äôt wait future urban legends Haunted Mansion. (referring doctors CDC) ""Every one doctors said know much this?""

Perhaps worst part even doctor said that--which, would sooner accept actually electricity witches tricking us whole time--it would still thing *weird hell* say. I'm pretty sure person replying sarcastic mocking Trump's penchant say things like ""people tell they've never seen someone pick quickly"" ""people saying I'm smartest president they've ever seen"" whatever. point Putin send Trump bonus? Trump half billion dollars loans coming due. Maybe big P extend funds favourable rate. would extremely rare happened. article title rather sensationalized. find evidence male infertility, potential happen. explain White House grabbed reporting numbers CDC?

Surely must know increase deaths since can't find plan action, controlling reporting would next best thing. Thoughts? Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck. also good target. Sars1 extinct, MERS inefficient human-to-human transmission. leaves four coronaviruses cause common colds - 10-30% them. Now, let's assume 20% distributed evenly among four viruses. get vaccine regularly, possibly often year, order reduce common cold frequency 5%. one common cold seven years. ‚ÄúOK, Russia fount evil.‚Äù Nothing one else could ever suspect. wonder counting people dying home, nursing home place. people substandard health care go hospital.

Not seeking medical attention also drive deaths covid-19. Lol ""healthy fat"" personal attacks host video change what's said video? guy video Swedish official, Swedish officials video. video could hosted porn site matter: matters video saying. deny this: control doctor Anders Nystedt Norrbotten Region stands Chief Physician Pia N√§slund Head County Health Care Per Berglund explains herd immunity Sweden's strategy, Johan Giesecke former state epidemiologist previously explained. hospital ship rules unwieldy made practically useless. would take COVID patients, anyone going shop first taken regular hospital triage get negative COVID test transporter ship. cumbersome process required lots planning multiple ambulance trips help relieve much stress hospitalizations non COVID issues drastically anyway. Rona DeathSentence keep breaking new record every day third employees local Kroger wear masks necklaces nose aggravating. Masks mandatory groceries weeks there's sign door, somehow people working give fuck. Come on, people. least set good example dress appropriately job, really much ask. Governor Newsom needs adjust lockdown orders. places need shut bars indoor restaurants. Everything else stay open long masks enforced. Businesses don‚Äôt comply shut case-by-case basis.

This safer, fairer, financially viable solution current blanket shutdown orders place actually punish businesses right thing along terms overall safety. many people fighting vs masks think bill gates wants microchip ... really hope surprised don‚Äôt count now, let's disingenuous. said shove UV lights asses injected Lysol. Remind people three things:

1. know percent could asymptomatic

2. know asymptomatic could spread disease

3. know rate airborne spread versus contact.

What know sick people could spread hospital workers highest risk. means focus everyone sheltering place washing hand diligently. logical thing fauci regret it.


People want hate cause love trump. absolute top field, knows shit.  Nope stating facts all. ego/face delicate wearing mask properly hassle, probably bite bullet become hermit never leave house.

Should cut internet it, too. Read different article found antibody production (or something like that) dropped 3 months people virus. means presumably immunity virus dropped. possible body could start reproducing antibodies (or whatever was) quickly reinfection occurs, uncertain.

They sure vaccine not. frustrating seeing people blaming younger generations experience, younger people tend work ""essential"" service jobs often public facing. time establish career yet option stay home, work industry less public contact... forced leave house work around people, get gas car, etc. increasing risk catching virus. U.S. NUMBER 1 U.S. NUMBER 1!!! think part fault lie media public health officials. Focusing solely death rate first months mistake. makes sense why, talking long term effects virus present weeks months difficult, wish point unknown consequences made more. least hearing now, maybe bring younger healthier people senses taking seroiusly confronted blames everybody himself

Just like fearless leader. Abbott planing running president someday? fine. new GOP talking point ""sure infections death rate down"" obliterated. Translation:


Eight ten children worried corona

UPDATED 13 JULY

Guidelines changed result, anything early days likely that. They're effective enough exhalation protection. give much inhalation protection. protect everyone else exhalation. would give morons ammo say: *he's political hack trying dethrone king*

Fauci biggest challenge career Awesome! Thanks tip cells difficult test though, studies show better measure immunity long term, sure researchers pharmaceutical companies figure make tests faster/easier. lot motivation this. Stock prices new antivaxxer argument.

Half million die here, doubt. mass burials every state reality imposes idiots?

Not sure even then.

Was talking friend mine telling one friends still claims hoax. Even though hoax claiming friend's son it.

I guess thinks he's got flu. best thing ive ever seen, played 10 times daaaamn im bouncin!!!! Boom motherfuckers! That's still trade-off, even public health vs societal change (although less police killings also makes public safer too).

The question **isn't** whether tradeoff worth making not. Rather question **who** gets make tradeoff? American people, scientists doctors?

It elitist arrogance scientists doctors think right make tradeoff decisions people. experts giving us science, without injecting politics message, let American people decide themselves. downplaying risks covid demonstrations, putting finger scale tip political stances prefer. right decide American people. vote red, mask please everything fine 
His policies direct threat safety family public.  arrested reckless endangerment public negligence. issue much easier prove re-infections happen disprove. need cases know happen. say sure never happening? 

That's why, scientifically speaking, moment say possibility ruled out. possible, low likehood would've seen cases already. Let's make clear:

What virus destroy host cells forcing produce virus particles. 

Any virus bacterial infection infect brains rarely infections many times before, unlike virus less able prevent getting brains. 

Unlike normal coronavirus, specific virus does, besides hijacking cells, destroying turning virus factories, virus also destroy immunity cells, bodies destroy living tissue remove virus. 

What means is, die getting virus lungs, meningitis permanent braindamage. 

Regardless feel it, people live wuhan sars braindamage. Elderly weak may indeed die this, healthy younger people much risk infection Without Actual Respiratory Symptoms long life invalids care pretty much sociopath nobody got time right now.

* also another guideline published exceptions business / care facility managers nursing homes take allow visitors elderly homes, measures taken make visitations safer on. (*However, guidelines managers specific homes control implemented.*)

**Please, remember lag reporting deaths reported certain day usually mostly deaths happened previous days. average takes 11 days report 90% deaths certain day (see links graphs looks)**

Useful links:

Which way military would go I'm sure. 

The biggest issue would long term damages stability civil war would cause. US whole would probably crumble due lack investment dollar crashing. Tractor supply month ago. possible. 

Plenty smaller stores, less resources, money, staff, lawyers etc pulled off.

Please stop making excuses them. legally mandated they'd make happen. here‚Äôs Kemp breaks local law, local laws go.  fucked royally nursing homes. Guarantee Governor would hated mob would attacking every decision made.

This proves weak useless governor guts moral conviction right thing. damn job loved governor, damn job whats right citizens state, catastrophically failed do! Yes, true many pharmaceuticals. Universities capability (or desire) manufacture drugs.  Tractor supply month ago. possible.

But really workers deserve union, without one workers rights workplace. I'm U.S., workers right especially bad need another Sherman thin numbers. would first time virus done this. Anything happen Im gonna press X doubt one. variance explainable simple immune function. variable humans virus is. 

For example, people think immune function 0-100 thing. 0-1000000 thing. Thats varied thats likely see much difference outcomes symptoms even. counting ‚Äúprobable‚Äù too. Keep numbers - election happening soon! Highly doubtful current government going fast-track idea. Especially since goes GOP principle making money people options. That's fauci. Fauci may Bill Gates rich, i'm sure he's got good money, happy family, lots things outside realm dealing orange toddler think about. There's point calm ""Just head coach Brian Kelly: ""We're going play football year, depends we're going play football."" LFG.""

this age well America place world politicize fucking virus. dumb people everywhere, America definitely takes cake here. like surprising political too. nearly badly, took decades lot enforcement.  California would like word HIV thing. UK government organising regional lockdowns R number rising, sort thing US federal government doing, working state county governments quite right, thought that. Memory cell - b - last decades. happens city ignores state this? officials get arrested? sign up? stupid, played rightist talking point. I've pointed million times shut right up:

In March, NY losing hundreds people term ""social distancing"" even floated around, let alone mask shitshow. Mistakes made, adjust fly, densely populated city country reporting 10 (or 0) covid deaths daily. excuse southern good ol' boys? They're posting new case totals higher NY's peak daily basis, that's juked stats, thousands dying. saw NY, NJ, MA, etc. got hit turned around, COMPLETELY IGNORED it. yeah, people died New York, fuck South's excuse ignoring it? Towels: Work? Meanwhile think fascinating conspiracy theories there, one far comical. Unfortunately many people otherwise part conspiracy. Politicians, like judges prosecutors, FULL immunity (police partial immunity). Can't touch them. Well, least courts. Lol really likes fuck mayor Augusta.  Yeah can. Hungary worked flawlessly. somehow got security entrance staff came around saw without mask told wear one leave don‚Äôt leave, won‚Äôt allowed pay shit want buy. walk groceries without paying literally commited shoplifting camera go jail it.   wonder lot friendlier responses weren‚Äôt included. live work lot people object masks, hard time imagining hostile often. first time, awful way would impossible way population, would starve migrate away country government much social security programs Let's see, Walmart, Kroger, Giant Eagle.

Where Ohio idiotic anti-mask peeps going get Twinkies pork rinds now? Here's logic you. $$$$$$$$$$ someone works Kroger county mask mandate, told can't enforce masks offer people. Dumbest thing ever, especially plenty masks could spare box two. Oxford vaccine shown generate antibodies cells case good news well:

 Mother Nature gets blame creating humans.  local menards home improvement store requiring customers wear masks since around late March. hired outside security company guard stand door enforce masks, instead forcing poor lower wage employees deal belligerent customers. store mandating mask this. didn‚Äôt begin with? Like started? seems pretty lively debate among experts, say it‚Äôs really good sign don‚Äôt confirmed case reinfection, others say that‚Äôs type thing we‚Äôd get data soon. Dat manifest destiny Regional policies could get behind. Yep, Darwin Menards state required them. Starting Monday, will. live ND/MN border. toxins 5G, duh Even children safe greed corporations. Holy cow, protests kind behavior. I'm shock Yeah, Canadian posted come point person Canada immigration standards strict US.

I know. I've researched it. may civil war come November. Things look good. Well, turns one countries develops discovers treatment hoping for, it‚Äôs good know one less person waiting line.

Eh, I'll score 3/7. watch last season.  better without terrible, rushed BS sat through. Rest amazing though. every 20 guys who's 5'10, 220lbs thinks he's 15% bodyfat, one guy 180lbs actually is.

Corporations also took stands climate change racial issues administration did. would truly prefer cures actually stops virus replication, type vaccine one. yeah, hopefully correct, Putin much gain China. Jeez! Another Trump reference. gonna dumb better tough... Covid agrees. 7 gram rocks wants suppress vote much possible bonus points it‚Äôs ‚Äúurban‚Äù areas car rentals - usually end state license rent car. heck keep giving people wrong population number, Thailand 70 millions (69.5 article) 66.5 consensus last year, that's huge 3 millions off. knew, lied people panic buy hoard away doctors I'm guessing likely ashamed whole medical system could broken down..

As things people misled about.. 6 feet thing based people standing still.. 7 days time frame survive hard surfaces based 7 day study.. 31% Florida children testing positive... group people never oppressed asked sacrifice anything country ever can't bring wear piece fabric face limited amount time safety society. pandemic turning even misanthrope. *Doom Song playing distance* well 10k beds free Texas Kemp sociopath. name news cares about.

Those cops paid Walmart off-duty. deserves anything gets! Literally Darwinism work. don‚Äôt think works pandemics.

Also [duty tort law, **duty care** legal obligation imposed individual requiring adherence standard reasonable care performing acts could foreseeably harm others. first element must established proceed action negligence. claimant must able show duty care imposed law defendant breached. turn, breaching duty may subject individual liability. I'm wondering considered ""under control"" there's vaccine.

I hope really effective vaccine there's going least quarter, maybe even third, people refuse take it.

So really effective vaccine, disease spread around them. And, unfortunately, people medically can't take vaccine and, possibly, children certain age take it. article Canada.ca website outdated. recent articles talking first cases U.S. Nah it‚Äôs pretty retarded. amazing get away police side. Yes, that‚Äôs meant above. I‚Äôm saying practice, enforcement much harder. Bit trolley problem, it? lied, we'd also see increase infections deaths. US ""empire"" dollar still worth something. Except that's going away very, quickly thanks way Fed whatever prop stock market cost everything else daily rate hospitalizations dropped according info put TMC daily basis. It‚Äôs around 1.5%. Still high trending right direction. 
[TMC Hospitalizations /r/TheyDidTheMath Fair point. could crack window open suppose Fuck yes! Tick tock morons... tick tock. Paywall actual article that's linked source uggh...the results distribution can't come fast enough. point vaccine highly effective therapeutic way best bet right now. good couple companies. Could use even more.

I guarantee 45 participants far healthy adults risk factors. wider 30,000 come map people different risk factors ages. know works, prove safe.

The whole ""anti-vax"" movement origins 1976 swine flu vaccine fiasco. definitely want repeat much riding this. fair, people really fight smaller government would say it‚Äôs actually good thing. government work providing data virus, let people decide themselves.

But, people stupid understand. Quebec people going protest mandatory mask bill goes saturday... races dont that? that's wrong, Sweden lot things. Mainly informing people uniform scientific-based way. work home, social distancing, proper health care people could afford stay home day 1, .... thing really locking down, (even bit surprising) worked relatively well them.

Feel free inform yourself: idea Brazil, brazils wealth really comparable Sweden even U.S?

Edit2:// Look Switzerland, basically even less Sweden yet numbers good open country get right now. communicate issue people. would wary statement‚Äî Washington state hasn‚Äôt well. lot stories I've heard Ontario either dual citizens US citizens permanent residents Canada. know constitutionally can't prevent coming Canada part feels made choice US pandemic deal that.

Secondly, ""Karen"" denote white person. Karen entitled person goes place business takes ""The customer always right"" little seriously. I've seen people refer many different races even men Karens. pointing women question Latina gave useful context story, whether meant not, racist. Sorry sorry.

There's also matter using size intimidation factor. That's ridiculous. Honestly, pretty disgusting thing reason.

I've reviewed account well, pretty obvious either troll true moron, know I'm even wasting time this. final matter attacking generation.

I became defensive age beach party goers mentioned. people obviously dumb fuck, feel incredibly reductive categorize entire generation based upon actions worst them. see calling obvious age. nothing person.

Finally, can't pull ""my wife Latina"" card get fact made racist comment. probably love wife much, still prejudices others heritage. struggled freshman year college, fact, due growing bigoted Christian area country. minority friends sure, exception, rule.

Now truly, hope someone shows kindness today. got understand regardless hard lash gamer internet, end, look mirror see yourself, interaction fade distant memory. want see man mirror attacks people hobbies. want see man uses size intimidate women store.

But blabbering thing mayors least try control it. 

Abbots statements laws superseded mayors story July 1. probably would say knows golf best, owns multiple golf resorts one golf better him. ignores corona.

Stop sealioning. made abundantly clear experts like Fauci throughout course pandemic steps taken. blatantly obvious president many governors entirely disregarded guidance experts. instead resorted publicly dismissing condemning experts.


So answer bullshit question:

Step 1: Listen experts

Step 2: attack experts present facts evidence like. Kemp high priest death cult said look idiotic? don‚Äôt think fully idiotic world? I'll bet even funeral homes realize people going go cremation bare bones funerals. Sure, they'll make volume, profit per funeral lower.

And unseemly bodies stored trucks. give bad reputation. agree this.

First all, impermeable fluids, no? even speaking able allow air pass through, wrong. 

My 77 y/o grandmother wears N95 whenever take doctor's appointment, breathes fine. glasses fog up, all(like surgical mask). Breathing one break seal, I've seen. 

Do studies cite, prove this? got everyone danger days. Sure lied ~~a bit~~ lot, also cared citizens became clear radiation really serious problem. RCT.

No, made claim help, burden proof you. Link shut up. Fuck off. many infected now, even possible flatten shrink curve anymore? Remember point starting cases back March. feeling we're heading herd immunity path whether like not. comes right government getting ready roll ""Go Travel"" campaign incentivize domestic tourism. absolute insanity. Hopefully rethink plans least delay campaign. We've lucky far people starting get complacent. Texas Florida? 4 months late. Manufactured non-profit sold wealthier nations around world. i'm convinced that's shutdown happened. enough major chains chose close first, governors issued weak ""stay home"" type orders really closing much  mirror? can't access site Europe. Kemp high priest death cult saw Hotez article earlier morning, still saved read. hadn‚Äôt heard book. I‚Äôll look it! Thanks recommendations! alone. Canada reporting in. 150,000 people whose family members died feel much better knowing think serious. Someone work tried tell wearing mask re-breathing CO2 exhaling damaging lungs. Yeah... Double defense zombie outbreak. believe she‚Äôs looking Ontario. couple years graduates. husband‚Äôs company branches Canada able continue job there. fear mongering 1 person  can't/won't wear mask, that's fine. However, people allowed stores. offered curbside pickup or.some accommodation. real imagine trusting government literally 2020. shit direct deposits bank account STILL withdraw cash every Monday. put there, take away. According [Labcorp real delays getting results Covid testings. People claim wait longer expected. Sometimes causes real problems. sure happens sure real infected person waits long, dangerous society. Fauci president? Broad Deep Expertise! i'm idiot lol Chicagoan here: thank gf bringing skill compassion young, old, vulnerable, taking care fight virus- inevitably become affected. Hopefully us Chicagoans keep things bay; agree people taking protocols pretty well while, although backtracking phases may necessary too.

People care getting erections way way way way way ‚Äúoh shot won‚Äôt get hook 18 years now!‚Äù actually winning fight hope people like Kemp go trial endangering public health. would require group full idiots understand science. know. could Trump downplayed, denied, politicized it. literally possibility. crazy designer virus remains dormant weeks strategically spread every state. 

You could every single tv station 24/7 20-30 % would still get opinion YouTube guy dodgy college diploma. Ah, yes. Stealing private data inexcusable crime except global pandemic REEEEE south shall rise absolutely bizarre. Let's look what's happening politics removed. 

The president trying smear head cdc he's telling us handle virus (doing job) single digit IQ president trying silence fighting virus acknowledging issue gnat brained subhuman dipshit president thinks somehow makes look bad. Smearing doctor make look bad, killing Americans make look bad. Acknowledging virus problem tho, somehow. 

Fuck trump. one generous thing say fucking pig brain must somehow even smaller his, that's impressive.  Time get back road, driving, sweetie. life bringing toilet paper lol. soon, you‚Äôll replaced completely, jobless streets sucking dick Big Macs.

Oxford vaccine looking extremely promising AstraZeneca ready produce 2 billion doses hopefully That's fairly average weight male height country probably elsewhere Asia too. say that's ""skinny fuck"" all. Lots going receive pay cuts rather let go. hospital can't really fire people specialized medicine still remain viable medical facility.

Ok clearly different definitions legitimate.

It‚Äôs easy disprove, orbits planets viewed earth (a number seen naked eye) make complicated patterns can‚Äôt explained geocentric model solar system, make complete sense heliocentric model. Unfortunately many, many businesses owners comply order modified way, law enforcement shown willing enforce mask compliance, even it‚Äôs law. changes, current nothing approach way get people cooperate.

If he's fired, outside pressure white white something. Congress media dig mess Trump's incompetence shown clearly even republicans.

You still comprehend, nice rant. never mentioned generation took such. decided generation knew age mentioned beach bar goers. became defensive mentioned people age. decided generation attacked.

Again, mentioned Latina part focus become ""Karens"", yes ""Karen"" primarily meant represent white woman entitlement issues. best friend whose name Karen Latina (oh go racist), says hates term, said apply meant white women. someone describes persons ethnicity automatically mean racist. came hot comment calling racist.

In closing, please take post defending trumspter, not! I'm saying need part even probably worst handling crisis ever (even worse 9/11, Katrina, etc) pointing fingers nothing, need take personal action, means staying home even U2 surprise free concert street, wearing mask. business customers like that.

Requiring masks restriction personal liberties those. think share values states anglophone countries

Up recently, far common latter (I want say ANZAC collective word I'm sure), think result pandemic (plus young voters coming age) help push back That‚Äôs absolutely correct. Russian meddling piece atrocity, ominous important one. Manufactured lab still freaking dangerous public idiot.  Haha. ikr. know sure, better keep dumb shit. Herd immunity terrible idea, complete failure. know people symptoms waiting 5 12 days results.

So, fuck guess?  would gone? It‚Äôs honest question. hospitals overrun. needed beds. terribly stupid tragic decision. would go? I‚Äôve haven‚Äôt figured out. least March April.  That's one xenophobic comment section :/ Blame goes state government this.

Not surprised all. kids never transmit adults. rising number sociopathic trolls fucking disgusting. Ah, Fauci critical Trump's lack response pandemic. naturally, instead trying correct course right thing, Trump attacking person critical decisions double poor decisions end killing hundreds thousands Americans. ya know, you‚Äôll picking viruses along way would take time even answer totally useless response.

Walmart tends attract Karen's hundreds least I'm from. 

Getting ready popcorn handy. Again, reached 1000 deaths 24 hours AGAIN. well hundred labs reporting Florida. Even twenty reporting incorrect positive test amount much effect percent positive tests.

From reported two days ago, labs contacted acknowledged error reported actual percentages 9%-15%. means noticeable impact overall positive test rate, 11%.

This also affect total number people test positive per day I'm saying know someone say exactly thread. add guns Please post/comment music links.

 SOS Children's Villages forecasts, corona pandemic worldwide school closures lead permanent loss access education many boys girls worldwide. Even spread virus, number children attending school already high 258 million. ""Now feared increase significantly,"" says George Protopapas, head relief organisation Greece.
 United Nations' goal guaranteeing children quality education 2030 thus long way off. Children poor families particular risk becoming educational losers. Protopapas says: ""It starts fact vast majority chance take part online lessons lack technical equipment. pupils lose connection. Without support, becomes extremely difficult catch up!"" protect corona virus, 60 percent schools still closed, 500 million pupils chance learn online due lack conditions, according UN. 
 cutbacks serious consequences
 economic cutbacks caused pandemic would also serious impact children's education. ""Many families previously poor dire straits. School priority moment. survival,"" says Protopapas. lack education one decisive factors increases social imbalance cements poverty long term - side effects. ""These include psychological problems, also child labour lack medical care,"" says Protopapas. situation particularly dramatic children refugee camps, whose support reduced lockdown. Trump told administration heckle Fauci, Americans like that, Trump reads audience, publicly denounces heckling ordered.

Fauci, adult, slaps aside 3'rd grader mischief job. absolutely do. Maybe social programs europe redditors love tout possible US provides enough defense entire region. navy also ensures safe passage trade ships region rife terrorism piracy. end? mean seriously. elderly tend solid voting block single party, party. social security / pension / retirement crisis could motivation? DeSantis stupid? Second test. Read Hiroshima realize one August day suffered 70,000 dead. Five months later hit 140,000 dead.

The stadium analogy I've heard plenty times this...really dives home. US city hit Little Boy bomb 2020 reaction would incredibly different. pandemic slower natural target blame US reaction chaotic doses insanity. could get vasectomy Bonkers.

As data scientist myself, reason would something like steer senior management would suggest something positive gain.

By deciding exclude negative results bad analyst/ statistician, weaponising data.

By means, models change data gets better we've seen modelling become fluid covid spread ridiculous. simple yes no. tally. 

And yet someone's agenda ignore negative tests? 

Only conceivable justification funding. Maybe that's gain? 

More cases % population = additional local funding? 

Shocking behaviour govern. novel time, ice cream mixed folded cold stone. thought ice cream sub par totally lacking flavor. initially thought might particular shop lacking flavor another shop. toppings selected kinda made lack flavor, I‚Äôd stopped going novelty wore regular hard ice cream places tasted way better. Go Fauci, go! 

Everyone afraid fired stand Trump's rape America. Savagely destroy fucker TV! takes common sense logical thinking every news station world following every move. would good way advance political career. Ignore death threats morons. Yeah, people need test results came get back line get tested again. Problem solved! guy spell science share frustration. vast majority 1.6 million recovered Covid cases USA experiencing none them. true that? Thats still going enough offset bulk sent DC. Well, guess Georgia doesn‚Äôt want sweet entertainment industry money all. public health U.S. *always worse* EU -- traffic violence gun violence garden variety health care. yet continue educating children. even though deny virus follow Trump, still love care greatly

You shouldn't. Largely presumption like said. good data supporting coverup Russia (I source Russian) use word fallen front line like war heros. reality wanted safe cou try, state local people made sure possible. sacrifice without warrant. who‚Äôs surprised? GA resident, sad.  He's trying cake eat too.  spent GA tax dollars flying around state telling ppl wear masks.  Lots GA cites passed mandates requiring masks.  Kemp said enforceable (which true.) logic would say Kemp wanted people wear mask enforceable rule, would pass state mandate since state authority vs cities not.  Instead exact opposite want make daddy Trump voters state mad.  Kemp reelection 2 years GA voters would vote dog long ""R"" beside name ballot. voter reaction even worry. blame redditors? True heroes bury heads sand keep there! draw lines somewhere. 

I think point ""overweight"" area ""healthy"" ""obese."" add new category? Oh man realized states led CEO lot daddy's money lot hair dye little brains empathy people. think already national level haha Fake news. thing gone Easter! data across country skewed make dangerous. 


Some reporting negative cases, combining positive antibody positive swabs together. Virus' tend mutate too. sayin'. problem successful need simply lie. Lies really speak general public scientific community it.  fun times then. bus drivers fuck around. scream till leave put mask. Says main side effects depression emotional problems. Women‚Äôs birth control cause blood clots. aren‚Äôt best gigantic it‚Äôs one recent companies America would screwed went bankrupt .

There still major truck driver shortage supply chain would take huge hit never ascribe malice adequately expkained incompetence..

Obviously nobody thought ""100% covid tests positive"" data received - report even says ""real rate"" around 10%

It's another example way USA screwing pooch here.

I'm sure someone along moment proclaim ""evidence 130,000 deaths normal flu hoax / beat-up liberal elites{"" Woohoo! Pop corks nobody Sweden wears masks, fairly common U.S. now, even states like Georgia. so, masks work, even successful Sweden. also open carry schools right it‚Äôs teachers. Hopefully that's one!  Meanwhile major retail chain work memo morning: ""We mask police."" disease outbreak showing stark contrast haves have-nots USA, fall worse. Wealthy districts built quality administration teachers, adequate materials, adapt new situations fine. rest fine. district left large percentage students poverty, internet available home. Due issues administration, everyone could leave leave. can't help wonder often similar scenario played across country. I'm alone doubting October realistic timeline. linked sciencemag article elsewhere.

Companies going always release rosiest prediction can. matter field.

remindme! 3 months TFW Kim Jong Un sense Trump. God help country. could mandate masks federal property states would willing follow lead. Russia even still *capable* helping without exposing embarrassing decline previously-vaunted Russian science? 

I think Putin investing heavily hacking malware capacity (which cheap quick) instead scientific capacity (which expensive long-term). 

When spent money fancy hammer, find way turn every problem nail. authoritarian rule, happens situations science community genuinely divided enough research come real conclusions? gets decide gets boot totalitarian dystopia? much unethical business hiring potential vaccine developments? Honestly wrong feels wish death others, point best case scenario hope for. idiots get killed, hopefully get someone else killed. 

Luckily really need wish hard, stupidity kills, tragic part kills indiscriminately. Also sat terminal mask on. Would like buy coronavirus skin 5.99 ? think best answer this, right now, ""we're sure yet."" urge everyone watch ""This Week Virology"" YouTube, listen podcasts. talk lot exactly kind thing, even among PhDs roundtable, there's lot disagreement particular issue.

The best thing seeing many informed people intelligently discuss issues psychological benefit viewer. much-needed reminder really *are* responsible adults around know they're want make nightmare go away.

Eventually, one hopes, sanity level-headedness trickle actual policy-makers.

Also, FYI, they're Dr. Fauci next week. I'm really looking forward that! almost like Sweden failing multiple different metrics.  direct threat, joke. Follow fucking money guarantee Trump family made money shit someway

As poet said thats call getting swindled pimped Kind sad Walmart one sets example. You, sir (small ""s"" intent""), ignoramus. really good news mainly idea treat COVID patients now. hospital system entire order sets COVID patients encompass labs, cardiac monitoring, etc. It‚Äôs super helpful. worry long term complications, especially cardiac related (structural) potential severe lung inflammation lead lung carcinomas 25-30 years road. Ah, joys pandemic doc (in epicenter nonetheless). rules

It's following rules. understanding serious pandemics are, knowing avoid catching illness yourself, taking measures avoid unknowingly spreading others. takes certain level knowledge know ways viruses use respiratory system spread, albeit high degree knowledge. takes degree compassion empathy (which linked intelligence) wear mask even one uncomfortable order avoid spreading illness. person must knowledge fact spread covid show symptoms order know social distance including sick.

All fundamentally related intelligence, time I'd give reasons dependant.

I see study makes people feel superior, people sucking dicks comment section annoying see. yes might offend people implies less intelligent. none affects credibility study makes political. way responsible many adults (not wearing mask). older get, younger 64 looks. know many people age still full life. Anthony Fauci adviser President Donald Trump something American folk hero steady, calm leadership pandemic crisis. least one poll shows Americans trust Fauci Trump coronavirus pandemic‚Äîand scientists portrayed TV Brad last year, National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, organization led Dr. Fauci, funded scientists Wuhan Institute Virology institutions work gain-of-function research bat 2019, backing NIAID, National Institutes Health committed $3.7 million six years research included gain-of-function work. program followed another $3.7 million, 5-year project collecting studying bat coronaviruses, ended 2019, bringing total $7.4 scientists criticized gain function research, involves manipulating viruses lab explore potential infecting humans, creates risk starting pandemic accidental Like science says covid cant survive uv light? scary thing U.K. numbers low atm, everyone‚Äôs become complacent. released statement saying worst case scenario another 120k dead here, expect numbers start climbing mid-September. 

Their plan? figure ‚Äòat point‚Äô schools close not. Meanwhile going back school mandatory fine parents don‚Äôt send kids, unless ‚Äòvery good reason‚Äô worried might kill vulnerable parent isn‚Äôt good enough reason keep kids home. 

So shit hits fan again, either keep schools open make things worse, close plans place type distance learning. It‚Äôs ridiculous. truly hope school districts preparing themselves. last 3.5 months school kids complete disaster.

 chrombooks school district using Google classroom. speak like here, instruction whole time. Yes threw equivalent worksheets week(most even set function properly). pretty much given weekly tests, without lecture reading learn study. wife search teach everything. little assistance teachers school.

 teachers supposed keep office hours receive e-mails, unresponsive time, would occasionally send answer key instruction/guidance all.

Lets adress first last high profile Swedish academic, Cecilia S√∂derberg Naucler, deleted social media enduring severe abuse.

No didn't. deleted account critizised behaving like politician scientists. info here: academic [Lena Einhorn several members ‚Äú22 researchers‚Äù first high profile group criticize Swedish strategy.

No criticized attacked. link shows criticism op-ed. pretty telling misidentify criticism critic, Swedish writer Jewish descent [Elisabeth √Ösbrink called speaking out.

I'm guessing pertains civil, adult debate there's abuse pro-Swedish strategy supporters typically engage in. Jewish lady called Hitler says:  also became apparent long found problematic: public debates Sweden conducted mature, sensible manner. difficult people deal opinions. married Dane, Sweden Denmark similar many ways. different culture discussion Denmark, probably due liberal influences Germany.

This sourced. Mind giving link called Hitler? No? I'm guessing happened twitter social media. fun, many times think Tegnell called Hitler social media? would take evidence Sweden culture allowing Tegnellfans heard?

That‚Äôs fewer cases cancer heard disease found, covid patients taken operations wards. Going lot less Electoral College votes states keep up. Target doesn‚Äôt anything multiple retailers go first, thing cheap shit can. Mask acne... yeah, that‚Äôs serious medical health condition...  Trump can‚Äôt that.

Bucks part people wear masks. strange hill die on, really feel like wear mask makes life difficult. That‚Äôs unnecessary hyperbole

That's completely bullshit claim CDC hospitalization data already disappeared. want downplay WH hiding data. people wear masks socially distance, wouldn‚Äôt reduce rates flu, strep, etc. too? stores open! Florida locked month jumped requirements open, it‚Äôs dumb!   clue you‚Äôre talking probably shouldn‚Äôt post much.

Your government failed you, remember, try make changes death vain (assuming live this). Still effective nothing, guess. Lol Florida didn‚Äôt want go lockdown begin with. Even one area took seriously. Everyone THRILLED home goods opened back almost rioting bath body works took long open. know, essentials. lawyers may evil, idiots. understand figures immunity misleading don‚Äôt real world data, example viruses reinfect even antibodies.

So although cell immunity looking like provide partial protection, depends immune systems interact COVID next time encounter it. mind boggled impeached. wonder real story covered insane coverage alleged hacking. need investigations figure governors purposely making pandemic worse state. Money? Politics? people dying, accountability. Masks save lives, period. There's questionable area. There's debate.

Milena Holdert Renee van Hest

Some important RIVM coronary guidelines employees elder care meagre scientific basis. apparent research conducted Nieuwsuur, tested number rules used previous guidelines experts.



It concerns substantiation guideline use oral masks. Many employees elder care wanted wear mouth masks prevent infecting elderly.



However, RIVM guidelines advised use mouth masks protective materials certain situations. According guidelines, staff could work unprotected short period time within one half metres corona patient. mouth mask would also provide apparent safety.



In recent months, Nieuwsuur conducted research corona crisis elderly care. could go wrong? exactly RIVM coronary guidelines based on? lessons future? answers found video:



RIVM guidelines elder care meagre scientific basis

Together branch association ActiZ, RIVM stated mouth masks could potentially ""dangerous"" would cause neglect hygiene measures. Improper use masks, example, ""fiddling"" them, could actually increase risk contamination. However, appears concrete scientific research subject. According RIVM would ""international consensus"" it.



Van Dissel based experiences



Jaap van Dissel National Institute Public Health Environment (RIVM) pointed risk ""false safety"" Lower House April, based ""personal experience"" wearing mouth masks long periods time ""observations daily practice"".



If asked, RIVM cannot mention research showing safe come close coughing corona patient short period time without mouth mask. argument mouth mask needed distance one half metres, institute refers ""general principles infectious disease control"".



Recent corona guidelines deviate earlier Dutch guidelines infection prevention nursing home care. Christina Vandenbroucke-Grauls, many years led Working Group Infection Prevention (WIP) drew guidelines, says Nieuwsuur recognise advice wear oral mask vicinity corona patient ""a minutes"". Even countries Belgium Germany apply exceptions made Netherlands.



The scarcity decisive



Care domes regularly asked scientific substantiation recently, receive satisfactory answer. suspect guidelines drawn way scarcity protective equipment.



Previous statements Cabinet also seemed indicate this. Minister Hugo de Jonge, example, said March 'given scarcity' RIVM drawn 'fairly stringent guideline'. Cabinet also pointed several occasions scarcity mainly intention use mouth masks situations where, according RIVM, necessary.



Internal documents, Nieuwsuur saw, also showed scarcity determining factor distribution mouth masks healthcare. words ""scarcity"" ""shortage"" mentioned first versions guidelines. terms removed April.



The Ministry denies guidelines based scarcity. supposed safety based scientific knowledge. RIVM says ""the basic principles drawn provide necessary care responsible manner, taking account limited availability protective equipment"". institute emphasises volatile contact patient coronary artery disease, distance one half metres maintained, full protection must used. I‚Äôve literally sat trying figure say this. come is, ‚ÄúWhat actual fuck wrong people?‚Äù bad week ball pain convincing enough even medical data relevant ongoing world health crisis? That‚Äôs dumb.

1. Losing weight

2. Eating healthy

3. Getting fit

Creating caloric deficit result weight loss, McDonalds you‚Äôre inclined trash nutrient load. also won‚Äôt make fit you‚Äôll lighter weight. 

You also eat amazingly healthy excess calories needs end quite weight. Many people know fall trap: kale smoothie, avocado toast, cup cashews breakfast I‚Äôm still gaining weight! 

People didn‚Äôt become lazy overnight, result 2-3 generations fast food, calorie dense, absurdly large portioned eating. People want lose weight need track calories get food scale. People want eat healthier need track nutrients. rookie number, one day. Sounds like lot people light symptoms then. well worth trade little bit higher Cholesterol low BMI finally blood glucose 115 average around 90 now. slight uptick LDL also totally set large increase HDL Tri's 75 range. eat crap ton eggs to.

Well least meet $6,500 per person deductable. that's paying $15K annually premiums. See? Proof Fauci bad guy. Even infectious disease supporting /s  cases going I‚Äôd wager you‚Äôd say ‚Äúit‚Äôs sadly refuse lockdown. It‚Äôs disheartening see. still turn around ship locked down‚Äù. they‚Äôre trending it‚Äôs Sweden lockdown. hope that's correct. know Jefferson County, KY, closed polls everyone could vote, open them, closed open again.

Praying safety family‚Äôs loss. Stay strong. makes sense.

They actually advertising workers help manufacture vaccine like crazy around March, know locally prepared workforce to. people around got jobs. someone please make zombie movie people treating zombie outbreak like people treating covid-19 irl? think way people might made understand. Honestly, completely naive think distance learning work. Actually, let's forget that. Let's act like everyone meet every situation going give disease kill family member. Let's act like reopening economy without killing everyone love possible wearing masks, social distancing, constant washing hands little deviation humanly possible. 

Or, apt analogy, let's act like doctors nurses act get ready surgery. think would probably fine half-ass it. think opposite ensure problems possible. takes work, seems better solution. downvoted asking questions? app insecure ? know someone spent 20 years Texas prisons simple crack possession. 

So yes fucked up. Mickeys big mouths suddenly high demand already shit. Yay me? I‚Äôve exchange many times seen many more:

Water also wet Shareholders also started orders new private jets... least actually USED lockdown. didn‚Äôt see anybody 3 months supposed ramp testing tracing education emerge metaphorical bunker shit *exponentially worse*.

/s kind pelvic exam results asthma diagnosis.... 

Or reverse, kind doctor performing pelvic exams diagnose asthma... anti-mask crowd want impeached.  unfortunately, facebook amplifies voices. everyone assume Covid tests 100% accurate? April feel well sore throat tested positive Covid. false positive test time really cold flu? Retested May, clear. June actually gets Covid showing true Covid symptoms ill.

I'm saying impossible someone could get sick Covid twice, point think plausible answer bad test result April. false statement? cases majority younger healthier population less die. still rise, much first ‚Äúwave‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt really change course all. whole part economy needs open possible without overwhelming healthcare system (or 80%, 70% system whatever decided.)
There really thing 2020 America (not authoritarian dictatorship) ‚Äúhard pause.‚Äù

Point FL, GA started good...but obvious signs (to close back large degree) said ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù...I also question Florida‚Äôs state government ability fold without tourism state income tax, that‚Äôs another discussion. 

They make decisions public health standpoint. advocating that. advocating open possible monitoring healthcare system. Essentially New England along. 
We don‚Äôt crystal ball. think GA/FL (who re-opened early) could‚Äôve mitigated much phasing according metrics nonsense. good options NY going different Houston. think NYC completely DL fall absurd. probably even social distance learning. (also GA resident). Nobody apartment complex except bothers wear mask outside around others. NOBODY (generally speaking) going voluntarily wear masks unless job place they're going requires it.

That's NEED mandates whether Kemp likes not.

This honestly makes fucking angry. Fuck Trump Kemp. typical dad-bod going BMI well 30. [Like so, they're hell lot better bandanas. Go it! I'd say real /r/im16andthisisdeep shit, far dumber take 16 year olds would comfortable making. think trust leaders track record lying? would ideal, people dont protected paid time off, try tough it.

Big part work culture bothers me. Sorry burst bubble forgotten one important factor! Bolt representing us Fl sponsored us. Therefore, god knows give huge amount meth race let run!!! He's got bag then! put another 2 3 mph gets faster faster...just ignore injuries way ;)


But seriously, I'm thinking florida win X factor one controls; much faster spreading state? mean, month ago would shocked 5k, two weeks ago 10k, last/this week hit 15k...as see, might even less control people think. Also, sadly coming quickly. finish line month Disney would guarantee win! continue nothing, time non-political reasons Exactly. given fact many low-income and/or nonwhite communities access traditional bank accounts (itself product systemic racism classism), they're likely take debit card option. traditional check IRS, bank account, would need cashed check-cashing business, would take cut money anyway--and finances tight, gonna take quickest option. They're definitely category. H&amp;R Block happens offer service essentially pay day loan (get tax refund week early we'll skim little top), referring to. immediately? never understood logic. dollar spent anybody dollar spent. think thinking poor person makes money likely spend it, rich person might let sit bank. much different typed.

Only idiot would pay 850. 
My best friend DC masters degree 0 common sense. Thats pays 135 dollars plus tip hair cut, barber charges 7 tip 5 caveat assertion countries nationalized healthcare systems none faced scale outbreak US currently experiencing. pandemic sort problem solved individual basis efficacy whatsoever, demonstrable responses nations around world. wishing death it‚Äôs president said? Don‚Äôt mad that‚Äôs leader said/wants. 58 dead reported today necessarily die last 24 hours, there's lag reporting. Also read yesterday, hospitals morgue space available, medical examiner space. bodies medical examiner people died outside hospital settings, least majority be. Could covid causes, accidents, homicides etc. 

I'm sure what's going numbers aside that, they're reporting less tests daily previously. Today, according data dashboard, 3,259 new cases 15,532 tests. Previously we'd around 20,000 tests reported daily. According Ducey last week, we'll getting 35,000 tests reported daily end month, 60,000 daily August. seem likely happen rate, though.

We also backlog tests waiting reported. sure many, I've seen estimates around 60,000. would nice see numbers accurate picture what's actually happening, definitely seems though they're trying make situation look better is. , sexy Mexican T.V shows . someone New York... say working getting virus down. see nobody streets, barely markets, almost none buses We‚Äôre basically running around crazy trying manage work kids temporarily time.

Testing answer. nurses answer (though, point, needed).  answer ""prevention"".  

A statewide mask order, would prevent lot cases. 

If politics, DeSantis would certainly listened doctors public health authorities, telling issue mask order. screaming last four months, statewide mask order needed. 

There basically two ways control virus:  MASK ORDER; SHUT-DOWN order. Voluntary social distancing work, people actually it.  possible outcome lots dead bodies, lots permanently disabled people. 

By refusing issue mask order, shut order, DeSantis choosing dead-bodies alternative.   cannot actually stupid realize making choice.  intentional.   haven‚Äôt even gotten first one yet ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It‚Äôs economy, means Wow, scientist [changing views receive updated new evidence? CONCEPT! Oh right, that's supposed work! let give prime example county's public schools. May, clear entire spring program complete waste, county said ready fall teach everything students supposed learn new year catch missed spring. worry got said.

A month ago, proposed hybrid plan 2 options (either distance learning entire time in/out school combination) affirmed ready start new school year August.

This week, teacher protests, said everyone going on-line least 1st half year, really means entire year. 

Then said, oh, yeah, need 3 weeks get ready DL ready yet. Even though preparing since May, need 3 weeks. tells school system nothing prepare DL. think anything less complete failure teaching kids year flies face history recent evidence.

The worst part children least afford it. Children coming families affluence pay failures school system educate, poorer ones can't. Well, partially right. countries manage. got sizable portion dumb fucks country act worse friends 2 year olds tantrums. Unfortunately draconian measures may way get hold hear. I'd love different way, there's idiots shooting people asked wear mask. must N96 mask touting People already saying communist goverment likes China benefit virus researches outcomes... wear fucking mask. believe strategy Trump's:

Number people die &lt; Number people would vote economy collapses

It's ridiculous, clear Republicans/GOP value two things:

1. Getting re-elected.

2. Helping rich people get richer (i.e. campaign contributions).

Nothing else matters. even well-being constituents. constituents get wise this, that's finger-pointing/distractions start. Probably due higher levels iodine seaweed. natural experiment gonna continue enough dead people convince everyone wear mask potentially stroking covid. Let blubbery heard culled. don‚Äôt need fat people period. japan got really less lethal mutation ? Lies lies lies. can‚Äôt believe it... üòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è anything, article shows may undercounting. 11% deaths counted due cardiovascular issues, know cardiovascular implications disease, really well known early days.

The thing is, cardiovascular disease tomorrow may heart attack. Or, may heart attack 30 years now. catch coronavirus heart attack, unreasonable assume event brought extra stress infection. Right. I'm Wisconsin spoke manager local grocery store told driving Walmart start wearing masks. explained people complained droves said *wouldn't shop saw employees wearing masks encouraged employees stop.*

I would generally prefer support local local businesses actually run people MBAs law degrees can't think business cost ramifications of, say, employees getting sick causing outbreak. They're following lead President ignores highly respected experts goes gut feeling reading memes Twitter.

Government stepped required nationwide March. I‚Äôm hearing need Grandma 2020 campaign. daycares aren‚Äôt ran homes. work daycare we‚Äôre nonprofit eight locations. go business, there‚Äôs almost way we‚Äôre coming back. Nope, disproving, number 6 percent. 

Meaning this: pushing misleading miss appropriated info effective are, like CDC doing, cause people make misinformed decisions risk certain things. Decisions made based faulty risk assessments lead spread. hydroxychloroquine zinc ionophore include zinc I'm generally curious... even point study? also non double blind, preprint... antiviral potentially effective limiting viral replication needs taken early possible. problem people die major media report definitive evidence actually worse studies like basically designed fail. actually think HCQ probably wont even effective (and side effects could problem) politicization research frankly immoral.  

 also ask one thing, last time insurance pharmaceutical companies United States prioritized patient's health outcome profit motives? USA! USA! USA! Yea, happy learned works. Places like Canada legit social security fund invested physical assets (no IOUs). US essentially ponzi scheme previously used pad government's annual budget. surprised receive significantly less pay adjusting inflation.

At point I'm going hope dump net worth physical asset (house) bottoms get USD together. None going end well federal reserve/congress central problem. keep brushing financial/economic problems collapses, guts stand make necessary hard decisions now. CBO publicly complaining decade unsustainable path on. worried Animal Kingdom open, thank God. Nice job! lost 2.5 pounds toilet morning things looking good too!

Quack, Quack post every day sub mainly reports mainstream Swedish media, compiled linkdump. think everyone give credence anon account internet (incl. mine) draw conclusions looking teh factual reporting situation, like  [the overview severe burden COVID placed Swedish don‚Äôt really care Nordics.

If state control increase cases, shut bunch GOP governors incompetent President cannot right thing.

I would criticize California, even though resurgence, taking active steps manage it.

prayers ya, girl Depends live. Like ny it‚Äôs mandate target followed now. news means targets across country require masks enter. ones it‚Äôs mandated wonderful President would NEVER lie us! /s Keyword: report. requires heck lot testings. that's pure gold. interesting article. 

This essentially speculation (which bad thing), there's real evidence back up. Studies multiple places shown ~80% people coronavirus antibodies may cross react. know cross react, reason believe number higher Japan elsewhere (the flu hit Japan much, sound expect infectious diseases would low too, would expect argument mortality would higher. applies remote places like central Amazon, mortality also appear higher. 

Indeed, there's also speculation common-cold antibodies actually make infection severe. evidence guess, places flu seem hit harder. 

To arguments seem unconvincing. article particularly so. even evidence I've seen IFR lower Japan. would cheaper focus mask-sized children IMO really true. Unless there, know told you. Target won‚Äôt require till August 1st. What‚Äôs another 2 weeks?? another several thousand infected, nbd CVS requiring couple months now? I‚Äôm LA. Totally agree point. Perfect matching ideal know dust settles even then, data quality issue exists.

I think 1.4% actually total deaths divided total cases date. havent found source number though. go FDH website 4,677/316,775 actually 1.5%. think original downvoted guy oversimplifying intemtionally misleading.

In case 1.4% 1.4% finalized claims point. large chunk still ongoing using aggregate metrics way intended get point, certain age would logical okay conclusion. agree 50-70 definitely age though. 80+ starts getting realm respiratory infection means high chance death. might change strategy depending long takes produce vaccine vaccinate enough people end pandemic. 

*If* reinfections happen medically significant rate, can't count partial herd immunity help along, meaning public health status June best could ever there's vaccine. turnaround time probable reinfection low three six months, virus waging war attrition species intensity can't sustain. 

If vaccines process continue pass needed steps along way, agree overall strategy remain status quo, we'll get vaccinated end pandemic everything really falls apart.

However vaccines process fail along way we're back square one late year, alternative strategies currently unthinkable start considered, current strategy unsustainable. mean let's real. think fair say 90 percent comes leader's mouths bullshit. say want hear turn around anything but. get away also average american care politics enough hold politicians accountable. Yeah kinda upsetting Biden option, whatever ends orange nightmare now. Dude know missing point, America's military propoganda game *strong*. Still is, really. early 90s early 2000s, much information readily available (most) people outside handful sources...print media, local news, cable news, that's it.

Remember commercials action movies advertising Marines? think still that, honestly can't remember. Mountain Dew commercial Apache helicopter? flyovers damn near every NFL game? Call Duty Modern Warfare?

Diverse sources since brought diverse views. people drilled deeper echo-chambers, sure, lots people see world really now.

Well, mostly. still easily manipulated. could part machine trying make think know what's going rest world never know sure, unless went saw it. Maybe Russia China NK actually wonderful glorious nations, richest vibrant diverse freeest world we've told corrupt authoritarian hellholes whole lives question it. Maybe somebody say regions are, actually, corrupt, authoritarian hellholes. know *that* person really regions, American propogandist?

The world fucked now, man. really is. least know there's wool eyes. 20-30 years ago hunch. spelled name wrong. DeathSentence. thoughts prayers go fallen. need vaccine now!!! may funniest comment I've read ages. convinced quack chiropractor say needs mask chiropractor comment know wrong. people, BMI calculator probably going fair representation. people enough muscle mass make difference whether BMI calculation misrepresentation classification. honestly think want vaccine fast accurate way it.

Like traditional way, vaccinate thousands people wait see get infected environment. know sure contact virus?

Even like Florida somewhere high numbers 2 months challenge trials know people going sure get contact virus?

Like live Palm Beach county one affected counties Florida one effected states US yet antibody test negative.

I see like 2 months totally sure vaccine prevented people getting infected. Without challenge trials.

Maybe someone smarter explain? I'm open change mind.

Edit: id like add well people social distancing wearing masks continues point sure people actually came contact virus? want find something trump said factually accurate? bout go moon get rock, it'll probably easier article written business angle.

Published 09 July 2020 11:40 I‚Äôm happy health they‚Äôre finally requiring masks. Must inept state government/governor. Stay safe. Like tell kiddo, ""It's nice want things."" leader busy taking pictures canned food. Nice. tired bs coming republicans. Democrats problems, far better republicans know lying, racism, narcissim, misinformation, etc. election going go one ways. None sorted likely hood, top head

1. Trump wins, republicans gain control parts congress america know doomed
2. Trump wins, parts congress split parties happened past two years continues.
3. Biden wins, republicans gain control parts congress, stalemate occurs
4. Biden wins, Congress split parties again, legislation dies
5. Biden wins, Congress controlled democrats get shit done

And worse possible outcome.

6. Biden wins, trump damages USA beyond recognition, supporters turn violent democrats hell breaks loose, neccesarily civil war, massive unrest

So yeah, probably understand 2020 election key countries future. also probably understand I, 18 year old started college senior year ruined pandemic, f*cking scared going happen country looking see get Dual Citizenship US Italy part Italian, born Italy US Airforce base, birth certificate place, generally terrified future. know Ralph‚Äôs owned Kroger. hope carry policy. I'm visiting Arkansas, right now. Good job, Asa. Everyone seems board it. I'm impressed. questions weren‚Äôt first place?  guessed New Bedford, MA, you‚Äôre correct. probably psychic. sorcery speak of? thinks he's witch!!!! Burn himmnn!! money fucking GoFundMe. United States always correct side history, never forget that. overall, largest part decision whether colleges return sports made general public. NCAA began return-to-play plans late April, disease far better track stands middle July. That's asterisk there, sheesh. 700m people thereabouts. Good keep trash Please refer `[this archived copy trouble accessing original article. I'm starting think obeesus chuck. Schools cannot afford socially distance, space.

In one affluent cal cities, Irvine, way see it, offer full time school elementary, 28 student class, 14 kids cohort. Kids teacher half time, half TA non reading math things. Secondary school hybrid.

Everyone trying go full time able small class sizes allow distance Hope steal vaccines, lucky enough any. Another great reason wear mask. Anyone else can't even wrap fucking brain around fact people going vacations right now?

Like I'm trying find ways kids still see grandparents, panicking homeschooling kids special needs, figuring ways get groceries without infected maskless troglodytes people whole ass families going Disney World. people truly living fantasy land right now. Moved 5 years ago. traffic definitely primarily inbound üòÅ. tell family Isabelle Papadimitriou fucked.

That's happens spend entire government's energy policy direction affirmative action action. effort make sure certain races get jobs mostly employing minority right instead creating jobs minority. minority fucked off. majority without skills work fat cat manager lazy bastards stealing left. Basically they're adding condition there's way Earth Congress actually does. Tell yearly flu season option. Sit get know kids see thinking. many problems schools, bullying, school shootings, oppression LGBTQ students, racism, lack funds, lack services parents want send children back become super spreader events. get it. Quite trip memory lane. stupid? I'm wasting time dont watch news... called hoax television, tweeted hoax... isnt enough convince I'm sure tell you... dont fucking twist like trump took seriously ANYTHING help nation pandemic. get way skillful retelling convince anyone actually paying attention otherwise lying snake Wait, might gift card Barnes Noble, buy online pick local B&amp;N? Iowa: ""We're never going close, Iowans going right thing."" bunch people crowding White House protest scare trick, long focus one goal try meshing causes it. ever anything violent pushback unfortunately. Free free covered insurance processed free? Love you‚Äôre getting downvoted. Pretty much proves we‚Äôre screwed. least headline, anti-maskers worried freedom change pro-maskers police chief said going charge anyone wearing mask. dumb decision... brother covid home, one else family symptoms tested negative antibodies entirely possible it, reports many people may shed virus enough spread it. Lol replace Canada USA USA Mexico suddenly I'm racist. probably also gotta hire train ""bouncers"" sort extra security well. I‚Äôm shocked. sister pharmacist Walgreens lockdowns happening here, store refused give PPE told stop wearing masks ‚Äúit‚Äôll scare customers‚Äù. work retail, couple days ago, witnessed older customer pull mask sneeze, spraying droplets everywhere... even bother sneezing elbow anything. ended staying home next day, know much longer tolerate idiotic, careless people. good news. paranoid freedumb nut bags refuse wear mask may choose now. Actually read study, others commented confounded association smoking &amp; diabetes, also worth noting ages - average age BMI group 60s (~66 whole study) bothered Age really dealt confounding variable. Yeah come science. need kill many children possible. kick people don‚Äôt wear em? done months ago obvious got ADHD dementia.
Bouncing round conversation phenomena called podium power. PP short. Everytime see trump know say 'Trumps gotta PP' I'd say good chunk world believe anyway, matter. nobody take vaccine, like even Krieger literally owns like half traditional grocery stores u.s. think run separately avoid monopoly laws, Wal-Mart requiring covers ton places would buy food. History made right country overall wrong side it. thanks good convo little guy.  Sad gov won‚Äôt Read summary.

Sorry, time you. Hopefully, stop posting nonsense here. exactly point youre saying public trust undermined? It‚Äôs crazy also means headline bullshit. Lots kids come America 3rd grade spending early years war-torn countries, refugee camps, etc. time graduate high school academically fine. kids wasted year watching TV going ok. It‚Äôs made *humans.* partially right.. go country there's internet access either, know lots white families access. ongoing issue kids trying learn home. country whole needs invest better internet access EVERYONE Oh I‚Äôm glad don‚Äôt go cvs Walmart, I‚Äôm going forced mask able breathe literally forcing kill self. /s impression US politicians really bad (maybe deliberately so) seeing big picture comes health care policy.

Eg leaving poor people ER guaranteed health care option benefits literally one. Providing preventative care would infinitely cheaper lead far better outcomes, still boggles mind country would enact policy. guess rationale something like ‚Äûif we‚Äôre pointlessly cruel, People never learn pull bootstraps‚Äú. anyone could think thing without getting headache beyond me. CCP bots downvoting u. thought always mandatory live California. one allowed inside without mask. It‚Äôs crazy seeing this. Even CDC made statement quickly could control everyone wore damn mask Gov. Rona DeathSentence believe live feed unless sitting back dead bodies. Yes, that‚Äôs easy produce compared vaccines booster shots produced easily well, given many times needed unlike vaccines literally election Target, saw one store employee remove mask sneeze... Duh Hell give away one cheap mask per person without mask week two person foresight get someone take step, yet still open schools? mind boggling. letting virus run rampant, close November everything shut prevent people voting. conspiracy theory it. Like every ""too little, late"" measure finally taking place.....I'll take it. too! I‚Äôve got little kids first two months (in Ca) shelter-in-place didn‚Äôt leave house. definitely think unhealthy. neighbors coming close, get car drive around scout neighborhoods less busy, large sprawling parks could get activity still remain unbothered. Good luck! send kids school kind, go jail truancy. embodiment ""broken clock right twice""  dangerous drive car. hear one lot. hasn‚Äôt happened yet, I‚Äôve long feared would outbreak National Hurricane Center Miami peak season August/September. Thank well written informative response.

üëç I'm worried. know fucked. I'll continue going like are. Wearing mask. Washing hands multiple times. Using hand sanitizer sink available, washing one is. hang anyone. Trips house limited. go somewhere, one day lil something every day

Have house since middle March. ride bikes know people aren't. walk trails nobody uses. That's extent outings. go see family fourth. one got car, wearing mask gloves. Sanitizing got back throwing mask gloves trash. Also would illegal try. So, there‚Äôs that. It‚Äôs frustrating see people taking seriously. üò™ That's awesome! media made worse talking enough it. media making worse talking much. never knew powerful media controlling virus. doctor visits, go local newsman ails you. already thing???!! Court held ""in every well ordered society charged duty conserving safety members rights individual respect liberty may times, pressure great dangers, subjected restraint, enforced reasonable regulations, safety general public may demand"" 


this judge ahead time Dagger lol....yes, take upvote unquestionably Commenting note July 16 Texas 300,000 reported cases. Texas top 5 COVID infections double New Jersey.

This predictable could mitigated. plausible? pissed all. Youre lazy would rather try make judgement instead im saying.


Lol that's funny, cause that's exactly me, assumed dumb shit based nothing. guess like it? Truancy laws still thing, though, penalties actually pretty harsh. Yes simply removed plus sign added 2nd minus. suggest enforce door? But, but, freedoms? right risk health everyone around me? get that, I'm confused team Trump went outs? That's wondering people give attention all. Sick kids make pediatricians money... Appaled? Hahaha may need relax little bit took way long though.

But thanks link! sun move. earth does. Ahh.. yeah, think I'll first line get flu vaccine year (assuming anyone making it). student? I‚Äôm student virtual learning disaster me, class mates siblings. doesn‚Äôt work. positive negative studies

The negative studies mostly treating sick patients HCQ known work.

The Oxford vaccine variant another vaccine development decade. Additionally, gone Phase 1 2 trials. Oxford group enough evidence show vaccine dangerous safely used, issue efficacy. Also, contextualize lifetime pandemic threatening cripple entire world economy claim several millions lives. world large simply time wait another year testing, especially considering Oxford vaccine pretty much proven completely safe point. I'll happy read ""Stores ENFORCING required masks..."" largely stores give fucks way people get removed gang people shopping tell dumb mask-less fuck leave. appalled asked, decided demonstrate request removing own. I've bought several age restricted items since masks became norm, first time someone asked remove checking ID. Others well, think Target first, one first. course exception, that's said ""likely"".

Also amount people LADA misdiagnosed Type 2 pretty bad. family members overweight years Type 2 diabetes diagnosis (for *years*) docs realized LADA. issue LADA manifests differently ""traditional"" type 1 often require extraneous insulin injections *years* - often gets misdiagnosed.

The good news relatively simple antibody tests properly dx diabetes types, lot doctors simply order tests. Ok conclusion summary:


The lack clear recommendations general public low uptake wearing face masks coverings may attributed to: (i) over-reliance evidence-based medicine approach assertion evidence weak due conclusive RCT (randomised controlled trial) results community settings.

It says conclusive RCT results community settings.
 
If effective, hard get conclusive study effectiveness wonder? I‚Äôm California well. stores seemed give shit didn‚Äôt mask mask mandate. it‚Äôs bit serious, seems like it‚Äôs still totally enforced though. Ik group people heading Catalina. People give fucks. surge levels. looks like stay slight decline cases, however rate still overwhelm hospitals. Atlas made policy recommendations March/April based Stanford buddy Ionnaidis' 'evidence-based best estimate' [10,000 seemingly changed one iota death toll approaches 15 times that. wonder, set circumstances would cause give different advice? opinions completely impervious evidence? speaking behalf people whose interests diverge greatly general public. son's life danger. zero risk factors problems covid. far say scientifically, believe immunity may last ultimately don‚Äôt know. People weird fetish rooting virus here. saw AMA doctor reporter sub answering questions general consensus wasn‚Äôt end world continue life people getting weirdly aggressive angry it. That‚Äôs still normal situation evidenced fact made news? Man gets dialysis pays reasonable copay determined insurance isn‚Äôt exciting.. 

And reading case went network, sure happened since says told go insurance company told go network denied would appeal decision still got charged would send case independent 3rd party reviewer would suspect would side patient. Obviously terrible situation far norm. There's 1700 players NFL, probably triple coaches support staff. way test 3,000+ people everyday entire season. Children Men coming fruition happens. Yeah, comes yellow can. Exceptional want rum redbull too. absolutely dudes gym 230+ lbs incredible shape. happen huge muscular giant frames. fucking school look like Georgia? Well big part vulnerability minorities they're statistically likely essential workers. thought ran sex ring pizza shop. Hmm Drop die part right. Cause dying it'll parents. Thank service. deserve hazard pay. US government needs step set example. Hopefully would encourage people wear masks officers enforce pediatricians responsible statement walked back. Also, should‚Äôve consulting actual educators issuing it. Theyre busy pushing people buildings Yall go ahead drink Koolaid, take vaccine pushed testing momentary gain political purposes.

And ""Karen"" comment sharp sack full wet mice. realize good option there, right? needed hospital beds. people go somewhere. act though damning piece evidence overrides good Cuomo done shows piss poor critical thinking skills are. presidential leadership, would asked major national chains months ago. Think many lives could saved much better economy would now. think good amount teaching going due much children learned. Good teachers great classroom management teaching. sons great teachers. state masks required place business enter. Blows mind far behind states are. depressing. problem even came back positive flu chance may also COVID time. Ideally would test could differentiate three seems extremely unlikely developed anytime soon. don‚Äôt problem lab growing virus, purifying injecting directly volunteers? don‚Äôt think ever approved. isn‚Äôt necessary areas high spread virus.

It criminal intentionally infect anyone unknown virus. first wave Spanish flu bad anywhere. much way restrictions. problem reluctance start imposing fall. petitions done anything?

(/s) assume there's limit amount time one willing waste this. Maybe third unsuccessful trip they'll stay home, benefits rest us. Oh. mean antibody rather antigen.

But yeah, that's shady. Gov UK also something similar recently shift data various sources. lot us following rules cautious.

Everyone else attacking us calling us ‚Äúsheep‚Äù acknowledging existence COVID That's even better, honestly. Good Barnes Noble. kinda like see it... 2020, really learn friends probably unfriend (read: de-platform altogether). Reducing viral load wearing mask also cuts risk getting infected altogether.

If 5 covid particles end entering body unlikely get sick. 20 different story though. spread easily people wearing masks around him. Hillary 2-3 weeks optimistic 35k cases single day I'm Spain literally every supermarket store mask requirement since March. Nobody even questioned it.

Be safe there. Sometimes even leave individual neighborhoods. heard people calling Capitol Hill shithole CHOP. Like, live three blocks away dude. expect government do? Lockdown permanently? 

And fighting happening, may know? Thats true. start large majority trauma causes South Africa alcohol related violence car accidents. fill beds. Amount drunkards stab wounds insane. 

I agree ban. can't deny that. fact think you‚Äôre able read article get facts, make absurd ignorant comments, you‚Äôre good go part problem. education worth mentioning you‚Äôd already aware fact you‚Äôre supposed contextualize information independent verification research.

Everything awful right can‚Äôt awful forever. Even Black Plague ended zero plan combatting it. Unfortunately true.  Sooo, lemme get straight. thinks exempt wearing mask due findings pelvic exam shows asthma uses note chiropractor proof exemption. WHAT?!

How hell find asthma pelvic exam?! Chiropractors generally \*aren't\* MDs authority issues types exemptions. Starbuck's barista honor bogus sounding exemption claim, thinks entitled half Go-Fund-Me earnings barista?!

This woman Karen; Uber-Karen. Thank much! allowed use PPE outside given. cannot outside equipment government regulations insurance reasons. That's actually part problem - left moving right accommodate voters decades. result lukewarm policies teeth make Democrats look weak. one wants vote weak representative maintain status quo cowtow Republican demands sake getting something/anything passed. majority country supports Democrat policies.

The party starting see benefits shifting general dialogue back towards left (i.e. progressives winning seats, Bernie getting mainstream attention). left US far right conservative parties countries joke. Democrats countries' super conservative Republicans. maybe signed left, got message effect ""You get tested, might virus, still suggest still quarantine 14 days"" read words 'you', 'have', 'the', 'virus'.  Well I'm going keep repeating national average. Yeah! sure late indeed. Information quality would lot higher u did... Super French study, boy Covid-19 exposed 80 classmates three schools disease. None contracted it. Transmission respiratory diseases, including influenza transmission, common study New South Wales, nine infected students nine staff across 15 schools exposed total 735 students 128 staff Covid-19. two secondary infections resulted, one transmitted adult data striking,"" said Dr. Raszka. ""The key takeaway children driving pandemic. six months, wealth accumulating data showing children less likely become infected seem less infectious; congregating adults following safety protocols responsible driving upward curve."" likely immunity really last 1- 3 years cannot fully get rid covid ensuing infections milder since longer novel disease? 

I read somewhere Russian pandemic late 19th century thought start one beta coronaviruses around today. Positivity questions hinting positivity get automatically voted sub. Another absolute piece shit position power.  sad whole thing turned political dick measuring contest. allowed 30% capacity, plenty people wearing masks, probably (and hopefully) plenty air ventilation...all China discovering like 5 cases day nearly imported, think they'll fine.

Besides much severe sources COVID infection, like public transportation. fuck take long think people prefer masking? I‚Äôd like introduce westmoreland county, PA see almost NOBODY masks even gotten scream threatened wearing mine public. People shamed area wearing masks. animal crossing island BEAUTIFUL ***The state, said, would ‚Äúwhatever necessary protect lives livelihoods Arizonans.""***

# lip service. See must meet qualifications rent &amp; utility assistance. Insane. Pretty much, shot would understood used much e.g. people flu jab Arkansas? NW part state 10% wearing masks.

Fuck Orange County, fuck quote Beavis Butthead, 'Uh.. guy needs go doctor tell ""I suck.'"" Trump power lot things, stop him.

Also, actually disagree, federal government power implement masks guise public health crisis virus longer isolated state, becomes federal issue. I'm glad graduated High School year. feel bad others though. like 2 1/2 months online ""learning"". absolutely sucked weirdos sub dont even accept survival good thing. 

jesus christ pathetic. dont care russia

That's problem. You‚Äôve become ignorant 150 000 000 human beings completely concern. die suffer, whatever, probably feel nothing taught life they're inferior.

One day fight human rights country, day completely disregard literally people - kids loving parents, oppressed homosexuals, teachers scientists, artists nerds play games watch movies day long. 

It's shame society understand true adversaries counted millions, mere hundreds. Communists! /s great Publix largest grocery chain Florida, cases rising dramatically. asked connect ""friends""? know voted. state advertising get free tests time. remember (I'm clear actual term) met guy claimed anti-constitutional BS job site. Things like wrong flags used Courts etc. Anyways told license drive blah blah constitution.

 pulls hand writin notorized paper claiming right drive etc. 

I like wow, good luck that.

It's mentality situation.

What puzzles even although realize folks like shop look things etc places curbside pickup. makes good business sense times. really want wear mask insensitive self centered asshat curbside. 

 Karen's going go mad able shop freely without mask. Maybe time someone made sit fuck stay lane

Sad thing seeing people come proverbial ""light"" hindsight hits home them. 
Problem little late even starts ramping status quo. 

Unfortunately even end still folks crying bullshit.

Shit part think luck I'll end losing life one assholes go living believing bullshit. CVS requiring masks since April employees pretty good enforcing it. Plus let 15 people time. I‚Äôve even though it‚Äôs expensive. Depends many make, quickly get out, many people take one.

If takes 3 months vacinate significant population amount helpful.

6 months immunity would enough though effectively stop spread summarizer bot, Here's summary state‚Äôs Division Emergency Management specify many people infected. division testing employees twice week also requires masks.

Maybe patients took longest die filling beds, hallways, exam rooms, ers, waiting rooms filled uncounted, newly infected, possibly sicker people. Wizard's First Rule.

The weekend lockdown mate went city break weekend north he'd booked 2 weeks prior. told bad idea government telling us travel unless necessary. response ""I'm listening anything c**t Boris says"" surprised learn spend 6 weeks lockdown like us did; fact even travelled train couple days beforehand suspicious flu like symptoms workplace people severe health issues immediately sent home. 
These people government late impose lockdown fewer people would listened happened lower daily figures. said street lockdown seemed apply partner older lady opposite; everybody else carried usual especially 3 weeks lockdown certainly call full lockdown here. 

I keep hearing criticism government slow push masks us brain wearing months. government playing slow game giving hate filled people time realize masks good idea least necessary observations rather told government hate - far effective IMO. 
On last point I've hearing anti Boris attitude made bullshit lot recently even back last year. Clearly another case small group shouting loudest make appear they're greater number 2019 election results prove otherwise. I'm still glad charge pandemic even last election felt like trying pick bad option bad selection.

Just interesting mind boggingly side; recently text aforementioned mate told I'm glad Boris Jeremy charge he'd changing mind plans daily it'd shit show. response? ""Yeah, know mean"" he‚Äôs one leading experts world infectious diseases?

That article shared criticizes releasing genome sequence fast enough. clearly know less two weeks breakneck pace anything science, much less identifying sequencing genome novel virus.

You clearly solely blame China becoming pandemic. That's dumb boils country controling epidemic. making statement like that, also saying governments around world responsible, genius. also dumb blame China solely we're finding SARS-CoV-2 sewage samples November countries around world. harping Brazil, France, Spain sequencing genome? clearly borders index case China. Where's criticism there, buddy? spread first? even matter you, gonna get strung along whichever vague, politicized article mind, alerting doctors treating novel virus equivalent public panic? Critical thinking clearly strong suit.

They literally alerted doctors December 30th. said:

* Supervising doctors shall hold fast discipline create specialised team-units.
* General staff must alert situation, especially keeping eye patients symptoms infectious pneumonia. 
* Statistical material must gathered ongoingly send Wuhan Municipal Health Commission Hubei Province Health Committee.
* Statistical material previous week, relating patients symptoms infectious pneumonia, send Wuhan Municipal Health Commission 4 o'clock, day.
* Without permission authorised personnel one allowed spread information medical treatment.

*All general staff* alerted December 30th. talking ass, already clear China love much.

There is. bigoted response. People like always go there, you? Since *literally clarifying false info facts* grounds ""loving"" country? pathetic. know CIA's payroll?

I‚Äôd say 70% wear masks. Good good enough! Depends go tho. scummier place lower ratio goes, ain‚Äôt shit? 45,000 cases later, freedom! could real, never know Republicans run places boycott.

And also, rightfully also demand mask thrown away enter leave store? mean, bringing mask you, taking it, literally defeats purpose? mean, surgeons wear ppe day, right? happen. complications like Guillain-Barre syndrome, encephalitis even hypoxic brain injury happen even influenza leave someone paralyzed. Pretty rare ""just flu"" pretty dangerous too. Waiting new planes spread reason. MK2, spread common sense.  That's stupid argument, see holes it, pity you. one group people terrible time.

[Covid act Thank fascinating piece history! History papacy pretty wild even perspective. I'm expert anything. hell I'm convinced take drastic measures immediately we're going see something apocalyptic Houston next weeks.. mean could truly horrifying. People dying streets horrifying. measures NY went keep daily death tolls thousand Houston none well past late.  data says outside safe long sitting talking someone while. safely eear mask walk around alone. Alternate headline: CDC instructed properly ~~alter~~ report data. Florida man here. Believe not, many people become numb daily covid numbers. remember getting worried back would 500 new cases day. saw numbers county today, laughed. Thats anymore laugh, getting better even alarms going off. I've Florida times, tend speak family there. interaction Florida employees tend come around world, long time Florida residents. population state really dumb? Mind boggling...  Florida sounds like foreign country sometimes That‚Äôs awful situation. Things pretty difficult everywhere, I‚Äôve concerned communities like particularly vulnerable well equipped respond.

It seems improvised masks may help considerably, though. Well fitted cloth masks multiple layers (even cheap abundant materials like paper towel filter layer showed significant effects tests). Even t-shirt pulled tied around face help good amount.

Recirculating air increasing concern. I‚Äôve read reconsidering research virus spreads air. 

It seems like may increasing evidence simple things like opening windows may reduce spread. simulation spread crowded trains Japan suggested opening windows could reduce spread considerably.

If encouraging people keep windows open taxis, buses, indoor spaces could possibly reduce rate spread mildly significantly cost close nothing, seems like good practice encourage.

Soap water generally better, given townships lack good access running water, alcohol based hand sanitizers make even sense ‚Äî cheap, fast distribute, would also reduce spread infectious diseases time, probably good practice long-term.

One thing could help: 

The median age SA 27. contrast, median age US 38, Spain it‚Äôs 45, Italy it‚Äôs 47. 

The severity exponentially worse age. media age died 80 many regions. half deaths people 80 SA small fraction proportion people age bracket, may proportionally fewer severe/urgent cases deaths.

For better worse (maybe shorter life expectancy due worse access healthcare poorer communities?) may make things slightly manageable.

The irony, though, even wealthiest country planet, virus overwhelming communities people refusing practice simplest things (avoiding crowded spaces, especially indoors, wearing improvised cloth masks) even poorest communities much better. 

It seems amount medical resources provides much benefit population tries wear masks, wash/sanitize hands, avoid crowded (especially indoor) spaces. Mine TIME?!

Just want add mask mostly protects others wearer. offers temporary protection wearer, non-N95 masks block virus indefinitely. around lot unmasked people, risk still high, even wear mask. made point sending money televangelists giving money churches benefit God, stupid do. preacher something? would keep windows open install small fans blowing away desk possible. absolutely need wear something better cloth mask shield.

2. Hard tell. truth thing airborne.

So know? contact trace protests? Doubt it.

Then article says may helped people avoided violent protests may ramp violence stops. statement even remotely backed science???

The average age infection dropped dramatically weeks protests, pretty easy determine why. Also younger people getting infected probably asymptomatic get tested anyway basically im getting likely bunk study everyone point like irrefutable evidence protests cause adverse effects fucking physically impossible  suggested before, think great solution.

Also, really depends situation estimate effective either hand-washing mask-wearing help. sitting inside talking infected person, mask-wearing much effective hand-washing much already touching face.

 5 months back story I'm thinking of, actually man car accident hospitalized. week later, died hospital coroner said ""virus-related respiratory failure"". Facebook version (man car crash reported dying COVID) over-simplistic both? southeast grocery Nothing reversed. CDC always would continue access data; it‚Äôs whether they‚Äôd still publish public. true patriot (and decent human) wants protect fellow countrymen (and human) get country (and world) back track quickly possible. make you? US schools unsafe open two reasons:

1. Americans

2. Air filtration

The CDC recommends open windows outside air dampers dilute virus air. know HVAC, ""V"" ventilation, life support. think that's part current situation. ebola scare handled well people thought would nothing worry about. know camp early on. watching unfold Jan worry all. two apples oranges, still psychological effect. That's insult Saruman tbh. fault article neglecting facts grant program DeSantis made contingent hospitals sending covid patients back nursing homes soon possible.

It also neglects fact fourteen nursing homes (as days ago) exclusively covid, rest taking covid non covid. fail see that's better cuomo Florida's case increase come recently. Oh wow, looks like new numbers sharpie say ""15 maybe none"". I‚Äôve seen places like pal: Wuhan. Italy. New York.

And I‚Äôm middle aged bro internet mildly keeps world happening.

The fact hospitals states still taken surprise glaring beacon upon garbage executive leadership said states hospitals.

A bunch richest people living little 1%er world - ignorant obtuse. Suffolk county always brought NY states number every day consistently highest area. New Yorker Manhattan look numbers daily. Today brought new cases city combined 410. know data correct Suffolk county bringing range 170-200 new cases daily weeks Worldometer sure article states first time 100 weeks. Don‚Äôt ridiculous. He‚Äôs Dracula. definitely see mean going update datalog? also read updating beyond July 14th stopped wondering plan long ago... re-used ice-cream trucks stint hauling frozen corpses? Asking friend. Probably thinking implying overreact. There's increase Asian racism blaming Asians lack context rustled jimmies think. I‚Äôm surprised took long. Government waits market take best course action...sounds like America me. Oh no... people threatened boycotts Walmart Costco mandating mask wearing shop now!?!! people starve!!!

/s weren‚Äôt obvious! ....you missed point post entirely you? vaccine designed grant vaccinated immunity, either life long, long term year, similar flu jab, tetanus. However, reports immunity disappearing 6 weeks three months. sold vaccine, certain give immunity, even year, dismiss claims say ""nah, there's immunity (or meaningful stretch time) this."" Seriously, Fuck assholes didnt take seriously right away. 

my family stayed home march way til mid may started going stores frequently. 2 months didnt leave house anything groceries prescriptions pharmacy every 2 weeks. hell. 

the fact rest America 3 fucking weeks, shows selfish are. 3 weeks would now. That's right brother kids abused going get hit worse 6 months pandemic, richest company world taking baby steps. doesn't. nothing misleading direct quote. said science stand way reopening schools. absurd. Well certainly wasn‚Äôt global pandemic. actually sounds like fun job. get paid beat assholes! nothing political Dr. Fauci's approach. Republicans one made *listening medical experts* political issue. kids typically summer camp. they're daycare. daycare bill $50 les mortgage. Right now, I'm getting ""employment related daycare"" state assistance help cover part it, ends August. school, able pay bills. quit (determined essential) job, can't pay mortgage. go eat inside favorite Chinese restaraunt christmas eve like stereotypical Jew am, well, might die giddiness own. Everyone different tastes.

I would love see make new kid's science show like original. 

I felt like ""adult"" show treating adults like children rather evolving format/style older audience/focus. think they‚Äôre gonna update going forward, unless that‚Äôs changed. Stop kissing mink, people! Yeah alright, Trump wants absolutely nothing coronavirus, mind stop testing problem. busy posting pictures fucking beans another 1000 people died today dont think anything take care children. able afford watch kids.

I mean pretty fucking simple. watch kids day cant work. cant work cant make money. cant make money cant pay bills. cant pay bills *and* kids homeless. dangerous dangerous sending school.

I dont know age average redditor what. seems like ton people, especially sub either insanely privileged money isnt something think about, simply forget money absolute necessity survival, even kids. look applying Angeleno Card, city giving additional assistance pandemic. source? And.... would‚Äôve useful say.....

FUCKING APRIL

What‚Äôs saying? 

Closing barn door horse bolted. 

Now everyone‚Äôs exposed months, what‚Äôs fucking point??!! Ok, thank dude, makes alot sense. Like said, I've never Disney world before, huge idea like. even think whole careless kids thing, helps lot. Big thank bro General comment Karma:

In 90's remember conservative people saying ""AIDS punishment believing god."" conservative states pushing masks distancing, fair say people ""COVID-19 punishment believing science?"" say posted? read article. I'm wade cesspool again. every submission make removed use untrustworthy sources. Maybe poor judge good journalism, ever consider that? Imagine showing storm shelter, half people convinced masks useless. crisis lives... far Yes, that‚Äôs thought saying. downvoters think saying? definitely case Arizona. ~ 500 discharges daily ER visits admitted. hope stay corona-negative. way read article positive go home, two weeks, need get tested, good. sicker longer? 10,000 hospitalizations ton r/p0l0tics here's Nevada's latest case/death charts, running  Meijer? Hey work hospital, think want dealing covid? essential worker whether like not. think would tell said want around this? Deadass coworker covid denier said didn‚Äôt know anyone it. work 15ft apart known decade Bruh, who‚Äôs angry living Florida? state one beautiful states. it‚Äôs filled lot morons doesn‚Äôt mean everyone moron. u surround good people Florida great place live. lot people visiting ones come don‚Äôt wear masks stuff. It‚Äôs definitely might something water makes certain people morons, u avoid people best ability lol Down, like Blackhawk Down... Sorry hear man, harsh reality absolutely best friend suitable partner align respect desire risk family's lives. 

You super direct, frank, fair conversation this. Stay strong Different people needed masks time research starting thing spreads. beginning people thought maybe transmitted surface contact, well aware main pathway infection person person spitting eachother basically. pretty new thing makes complete sense change stance newer research.

Its like blasting metrologist getting forecast wrong. know much sign strength, weakness, admit wrong Doubling evil sociopathy HIV Aladeen second idea can‚Äôt him. Let‚Äôs open bars restaurants state surges. He‚Äôs idiot Bar adds fortune cookies menu 25 cent Nachos. find CDC put previous data back took update it? I‚Äôm really sick tired people acting selfishly reckless expecting sympathy 5 star service special treatment. ‚ÄúOhhh didn‚Äôt know bad‚Äù. Yeah fuckin did. thought rules didn‚Äôt apply you.  I‚Äôm getting real sick it. Seriously. genuinely terrified could headed. sorry gears operate. nice starting point pays society. freeloads benefits whos worse confirmed transmission COVID-19 mammals humans. I'm sure 100,000 minks need slaughtered? can't bothered Google H1N1 infectious deadly? microbiologist virologist.

No fuckin shit. likely left thing Honest question: can‚Äôt bank accounts? There‚Äôs credit requirement open account. there‚Äôs monthly fee it‚Äôs cheaper paycheck cashing place? certainly misleading. rest may make ""better"" makes entirely different argument. WTF Harris Teeter? I‚Äôve lived SoCal entire life. mom succinctly said day, ‚ÄòThere things worse death.‚Äô Living chronic conditions we‚Äôre seeing result virus something want either. mom unrelated chronic illnesses wouldn‚Äôt wish anyone deal them, especially illness like covid preventable.

**Titles must edited source.** submissions must submitted original title submitted article applicable. article uses caps title, changed [title Editorialization via title editing kind likely removed. ([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* assume want access data? could trying gain access undermine progress, falsify data, gain foothold critical systems, etc. says science shouldn‚Äôt get way, follows saying science side open schools. 

So... it. families stay mostly separated. sure pioneer families really worried that. kids sleeping, happy h oldest even asked stay home. anecdotal, kids mental health responsibility 7 years reaching point ""fuck this, quit."" you? realize Hong Kong different China? much make week? Lowest know anyone getting California example $178. state in? money come this? Moronic states: ""We going mandate masks!""

Covid-19: üëç YES! Thank would, , know kids kindergarten 3 years 

They chew mask , might eat , play , take off.... get bodily fluids pee it.

Take cough open air 

Oh many parents 100% take kids school covid symptoms feel bad

I know kids weather covid well generally could still transmit , never end unless stop transmission hard wear mask even death rate &lt;1%??? like then, folks wanting non-slave states get majority throwing fits new states predecessors people wanting DC statehood PR statehood ""because unbalance Senate"". Congress balanced, representative people country. Home depot/lowes next? DeSatan wonder actually plan, someone said ""We gotta control numbers"" took literally beginning. feel bad health care workers. still see people dick noses Costco honestly gives much anxiety. try get shit leave ASAP honestly want call people out. deeply upsetting since live someone risk need go stores buy supplies.  think work think harmful Covid? Ok I‚Äôm confused. don‚Äôt believe?

And answer earlier question, safety population less job description. need provide safety people idiots. people weren‚Äôt idiots we‚Äôd need no/minimal police. Instead need lot police. lot police = lot money. Money = resources. idea downvoted. Something rushed much riding bound things overlooked name expediancy.

I'm anti vaxxer, like cars. one general rule thumb never buy first generation new car. still working kinks design flaws might apparent clinical setting show extended use variety scenarios. I'm taking similar attitude vaccine. Also, company ever received bailout EVER needs barred permanently stock buybacks. can‚Äôt wrap head around that‚Äôs even legal first place, much less taxpayer bailed company. None numbers - hospitalizations, positive tests, etc - sanely compared previous values hit saturation point. There's cap many people die though, mostly use gauge happening (or rather, happening weeks ago) without mask fucking idiot death wish **for others**.

FTFY Actually incredibly disturbing,what goes people's minds??? never done before, can't imagine hard is. True. Kohls treats employees like cannonfodder gets reap benefits ""being safe caring"" simultaneously paying workers shit wages. little late Kohls article found might answer question.

Should aspirin used prophylaxis COVID-19-induced There's reason believe people can't change. learn experience. glad he's changed mind. can't punish someone forever 'sins' past. People change. allowing people change minds issue means lose discourse one another no-one want express opinion anything ever case opinion loses favor future. would huge loss society.

He's changed, he's sorry. Accept move on. agree anything, compassion quality showing lot right now. Sounds like Florida. Trump sniff say ""I like Dr Fauci he's wrong everything far."" SW CO here, local FB pages filling people complaining. 

So tired posting links trying give facts GOOD thing.

But nope, it‚Äôs ‚Äúour god given rights trampled!!‚Äù disagree, man, Las Vegas sooooo screwed. 4 months ago CDC saying masks work. infections similar organisms occurred higher rate per million 100 thousand adult population.

Can explain means? idea comment means. Wear masks. Wash hands. Socially distance (6‚Äô). three together. Stay home can. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm NY. stores require mask enter. employees customers wear them. rare occasion see mouth breather without one Walmart. enforced even though already signs stating need mask enter. want right wear mask ? Well stores legal right deny dumbass entry without mask Wow, that's mind boggling. big company? premises? could try anonymously reporting property management company call state line etc. Ideally employee coming work get tested shouldn‚Äôt go work imo Almost wants stop illegal immigrants know illegal cross border like that. Trump figured people kiss ass money power. quite understand... white house president get say data published? regarding something like public health? can‚Äôt even imagine army Karen‚Äôs lose minds this. Agreed. say lot bullshit...all time. one kind rocked back heels little bit. People arent used them. foreign concept many. Yelling berating isnt going change behavior. I'd rather someone partially wear mask wear mask spite everyone criticizing them. Oh wow. There‚Äôs still idiots like saying shit losers said March? So, you‚Äôre selfish incapable learning? makes sense. Plus obviously unconscious patient won‚Äôt able assist. informing someone health consequences choices considered ""shaming."" unpleasant (and inconvenient) truths.

Honestly depends done think. telling random person internet posts unrelated content 'Hey fat' probably helpful. talk someone actually know taking care themselves, maybe fine. Still then, idk want boss talk (desk job) would listen friend, relative, doctor. know, people actually informed discussion make assumptions. 

In words, time place this. Fat people pretty aware fat part. people really know healthy, simple reliable spaces obtain helpful information considered shameful. reason people take mean personal responsibility tell every fat person see 'you fat' makes kinda jerk. Oh yeah, site source please, would love read it... Strike. Strike. Strike. done good job throughout later 20th century disempowering workers, can't even organize strikes. doubt unfortunate amount teachers also anti mask though.

People poorly educated design, see teacher's strike benefit workers. power worker many convinced see strikers adversary. Divide conquer, guess. 


Here Canada, looking send kids back school come September. seeing record low case numbers, places mask policies. Now, think likely see spike cases come Fall. hope putting plans place test locally close schools case discovered. know else test trace isolate needed. Generally Europe hit half deaths coming oldest/weakest/sickest nursing homes....just like America. lockdown policy stopped deaths. Sweden let play seasonally. amount people would've died either way countries pattern mild deaths across many countries last flu season - building larger popular likely suffer worst effects illness. r/publicfreakout bout FREAK Oh, agree completely. really making joke unsuited job. Unless job spew bullshit combative, case great. every Target anything like local Target (in County Countywide mask mandate), *aren‚Äôt* taking action. They‚Äôre putting press release saying they‚Äôre taking action. They‚Äôre putting signs stores saying they‚Äôre taking action. walk inside half employees masks covering noses nobody stops customers walking without mask. larger proportion population risk, think mean.

In words, infections similar organisms occurred higher rate per million 100 thousand adult population. Yeah don‚Äôt kids great. laws regulating alcohol drugs minors. laws restricting weed, seatbelts... Bold author assume recovery... People downplay mutation fearmongering many humans world already mutation made huge difference February. That's like 3 months noticed emerging. virus even prevalent time! infecting millions people US. odds mutating something cause change transmission virulence real. could get weaker could get stronger, idea control it. 
 
Now important time stay home. Yes virus rampaging population stay home behavior effective early still low prevalence. 

I'm Chicago, tipping point. time really pump brakes. exponential growth, early intervention makes difference. Good luck. read former game show host thought would article roasting trump lol dumb. hope people don‚Äôt listen 'Teachers students step bodies dead teachers students."" said Publix too. large FL footprint makes sense. Maybe Kroger HEB? Exactly. politically motivated ulterior motives people care children, education, educators they‚Äôre actually putting harm‚Äôs way. like say ‚Äúrequire masks‚Äù Walmart guy stands outside goes ‚Äúsir/ma‚Äôam mask‚Äù I‚Äôve seen several people say still lets in. countries aren‚Äôt reporting, reporting, trash countries ""You mean hundreds health care workers state aware numbers send us can't make good? Rigged!"" Nahh know, sorry first comment came like harping you. think important fight better pay better conditions language use way mitigate that. think important recognize. March chance acceptable parents children you‚Äôre saying ‚Äúoh well‚Äù to. person instruction fall. hope really pisses someone says oh well. Oh right, proning. hope helps patient. Good! I‚Äôm glad see retailers stepping President refuses do.  noted rare, single child died Canada. sure nationwide Walgreens near requires masks well makes sense, since east coast hit hardest earliest people take seriously plus it‚Äôs also liberal. I‚Äôm gonna go grocery store. Maybe Kroger Publix (esp large FL presence Publix has) It‚Äôs Holy jingle jangles, pay like 1300/month INSURANCE?!?!

I know gonna come across shitty, insurance annual premium poverty line, expect bring home income least 3x (45k+). amazingly bad coverage ridiculously expensive, doubt, I'm bit less worried millions making 20k qualify Medicaid/care insurance job closed. seems like bunches Sewden news recent days, hmmmmmmmmm """"Rich people's grocery store"" Monroeville""? made laugh.

Shockingly enough, Washington PA people pretty good wearing masks stores. Might proximity Pittsburgh. I've seen people take mask soon get away door minority. 

We good percentage nose wearing least keep mouths covered they're speaking guess that's something. US bad mean China absolute terrorist well.

Never said Muslim genocide real, can't believe denying documented genocide.

Documented who? CIA? people trying sell war Venezuela? Bruh, don‚Äôt get sucked this. Many Muslims China spoken lies also controls abuses citizens social credit system.


Aaaand lost last credibility. isn‚Äôt even place yet, it‚Äôs still testing. agree, cmon basic facts you‚Äôre acting like know you‚Äôre talking about. Somebody let Brian Kemp know PHOENIX ‚Äî Refrigerated trucks rushed Arizona number coronavirus cases deaths skyrocket, exceeding capacity local hospitals morgues. 

Please wear mask Peet‚Äôs sake. Good Lord. KN95 masks available bonafidemasks.com reasonable prices

Unless admin let protect yourself. happily await time anti-maskers place shop. ""if agree rich guy surely end rich too!"" Brought unnamed sources ""Saddam nukes"". 

I get makes sense, would unable use Oxford's vaccine?  right harm others. Target weeks. No. I‚Äôm saying opposite. One patient needs much care. AKA Many people general getting Covid San Antonio, gotcha. Someone tell walmart then. Also, big point country going expand west. south wanted bringing slaves them. Every Airport: can't bring many ounces liquid plane.

FWIW, TSA chill idiots make job difficult, theyll detain leave em small room without hesitation. can‚Äôt believe amount people NY/NJ/MA Florida right now. middle pandemic quit vacationing!!! God fucking hope thing. covid shit awful.  parent see many parents clamoring reopening justification ""kids die much"". try explain deaf ears illness recovery time still impact families parents take time care ill children extended periods. rude awakening EU clusterfuck example handle things, something aspire to. mask mandate indoors. police enforce it, health department ensure/help businesses so. That's Southern Heritage, that's relatively modern scientific advancements largely funded ran federal government national/international corporations.

The reason NASA south convenient launch latitude, big businesses south favorable tax business laws allow make even profit. particular reason tying southern culture people. * Belgium: High peak, excess deaths 1 month 845 deaths / million . died mostly single month
* Italy: Mid peak, excess deaths 1-2 months 579 deaths / million . died mostly two months
* Sweden: Low peak, excess deaths 3months+ 554 deaths / million. died THREE months
* Denmark: Never reaches excess deaths threshold 105 deaths / million

In Belgium Italy people died due high sudden peak deaths reduced due lock-down.

In Sweden people died took 3 months case numbers finally drop low enough death rate fall excess deaths. major hospital shortage. simply died spread virus reduced fast enough allowing people get infected time. 

Sweden got excess deaths threshold. something countries managed 1-2 months ago saving lot lives. Mexico already closed southern border, lol. build wall keep Covid-19 refugees north, Trump fulfilled outrageous campaign promise. like it, flaw cars barged Bellingham, jumped middle trip............ amount times I've seen sentiment need inflate numbers make people understand bad mindboggling.

Deliberate under-reporting bad, deliberate over-reporting good? accurate reporting? Last checked, facts lying it, ""good intentions"" not. assumption people can't get follow test clear stay home indefinitely decide free about? Yep. fiancee received nothing yet Actually happen, sort of, Canada. Besides business loans, commercial rent subsidies, 75% wage subsidies (now extended economic recovery phase), expansion Employment Insurance, government created $2,000 CDN per month payment called Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB). extended summer replaced something better designed economic recovery. problem current design ""notch"" Benefit schedule-- i.e. earn additional $1000 per month without losing CERB benefits earn $1001 lose entire benefit. people designed program probably (normally terrible idea) order super simple program took 2 weeks implement (online applications direct deposit benefits tax account) really encourage people work (stay home Public Health goal lockdown). economy continues pickup design logically go couple directions-- take next CERB extension fall UBI similar existing program seniors Ontario Basic Income experiment make Employment Insurance-like. Personally would pump bolder move towards UBI, estimated cost $80-150B CDN Parliamentary Budget Office, would smallish net cost could replace Employment Insurance, Social Assistance (provincial responsibility) smaller wage incentive tax credits (that $100B normal times). note Spain already gone UBI route. dad watched video one time much money top Twitch streamers make, like, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt become Twitch streamer make money?‚Äù valid point.

Denmark open √ñsterg√∂tland. fact, said foreign ministry Denmark isn‚Äôt true. says 20 cases per 100k per week. go SSI says average two weeks. √ñsterg√∂tland 40 13. it‚Äôs another weeks wait. üòû fucking problem. can‚Äôt Karen needs haircut üôÑ buold wall, arizonians pay it, hard data countries.

California mask mandates, mean every business every person consistent mask wearing mandated. Conversely, mask mandate GA, know many people choosing wear masks volition there. much better experiment would trying see state enforced mask mandate real penalties vs state mask mandate proven low mask usage. right probably best situation we've got, might well use whatever data come it. low quality source history problems facts. heard butt stuff pays well. Health benifits shit... literally. deal crap day. Get comfortable assholes. overall, growing field. could written this. feel frustrated, angry, disheartened many fellow Americans can't simplest, basic thing get keep numbers try get past least amount death economic hit. say nothing political spectrum wants us remain ignorant, sick, poor, constantly fighting basic things.

This country anymore want out. amount people understand antibodies supposed stick around forever ridiculous. matters whether B cells able reproduce antibodies necessary, apparently that's heresy tell people. suck first thing hear reinfection start yelling nonsense ""3 months"" ""no immunity"". problem ‚Äúshort opening up.‚Äù need open up. Falling short way failing public putting harm pandemic. 14 days? joke. get results 24 hours Canada. kinda did. knew enough masks worked working really hard get healthcare workers. It‚Äôs common sense masks either helped harm, CDC went way convince general public wearing unnecessary, reiterating wasn‚Äôt airborne reality didn‚Äôt know airborne not. Yeah, they're 90 percent blame anti mask movement. post supposed OSHA certified triggered all.  work. I'm actually married someone program director hybrid college. issue online student buy-in. Since distance, individualistic isolated students often lack buy in, leads poor performance. 

What see issue school many others I'm familiar admin concerned properly administer it. district Superintendent proposed board 100% online Oct, reassess monthly. I'm actually sitting waiting Zoom meeting begin Board votes it. I'm also queued speak topic board. 

We need professional development teach subjects best online. We're getting that. tentatively given required me, seem think 1:1 delivery course materials I'm classroom. know they're take Oct people find out, deemed failure. want happen figured I'd go straight top, board itself.

OP seem read either; made claim, right comments, we're something compromise records. taking speculations we're something harm doctors patients.

And that's environment Russians operate day day; that's casually we're lied about; that's ubiquity Anglo lies Central/Eastern Euro self-pity parties. almost like revel liars hypocrites. know better that.

Well yeah. families need duel income stream order stay afloat depend childcare/school they're work. can't work home hell, even working home unrealistic expect people able take care kids well keep full-time workload still keep job. 

It's really hard spot in. majority Americans live paycheck paycheck. Becoming unemployed could mean food table losing house quickly.

It‚Äôs perfect think. people they‚Äôre supposed largely, government resistant testing. It‚Äôs quite difficult get tested, number tests really low. Found CNN article [HHS directs CDC put Covid-related hospital data back yepper...... acknowledges wrong, take responsibility anti-mask rhetoric he‚Äôs spewing. lot people aren‚Äôt strong enough admit wrong double-down.   Hopping believe train. Where's source? I'm constantly amazed many grown ass people know difference fact opinion. Even educated smart people still sometimes think opinions strongly believe become facts stating opinion certain way makes fact. Thanks considering pulling kids school private online program? many well established, user friendly, interactive, inexpensive teaching programs around years. I've frustrated district invest one instead teacher essentially start scratch. Anyway, that's we're thought I'd pass along idea.

One problem lot ""free"" programs put together state managed school district state. state sends tax money child signed online school. local district can't sign district kids' program without losing funding laying teachers. They're forced tell parents compete programs whether deliver not. That's Chicagoland area Jewel-Osco Starck Van tils. unlikely thats reasoning behind this, vaccine boom due patent.

You want kids daycare. get it. sucks. shitty situation. pay daycare means teacher MAY DIE. getting numbers from? differ greatly state's numbers. Maybe hope pandemic then? Cringe. back fourth guy said suffers COPD resting SpO2 90. wear mask virus 99.65% (according him) survivable. 

I explained would fall .35%

Then started going Kennedy's assassination 9/11.

Cookoo. healthcare professionals died - 400 US? can't seem find stats. average even 6 years schooling people, 2,400 years, least. blows mind. 

It commonly compared flu think flu killed many healthcare professionals?

Im really tired hearing everyone shit America horrible country. people shitting gladly exposed thousands people protest spread germs.

Im saying protests weren‚Äôt good necessary. people turn around blame ‚ÄúKarens‚Äù share much blame. 

So reason Canada lower infections USA isn‚Äôt failed follow protocol. It‚Äôs mass riots caused curve go back up. Canada didn‚Äôt like did.

Granted many us fail follow protocol. It‚Äôs annoying everyone wants blame others really share equal blame unconstitutional restrict travel states.

Since risk groups (including 70+ year olds) still isolation therefore able get disease impossible reach 70-80% immunity required. rest population social distancing reduce spread. fact social distancing measures employed working building total herd immunity.

However, partial herd immunity effect spread even low levels. Swedish officials talking media failing understand.

Today, Johan Carlsson FHM guesstimated immunity Stockholm around 40% (including T-cell immunity), half urban regions like Gothenburg much lower rural areas.

How much actual immunity affords course unknown would virus different coronaviruses know already, like SARS MERS? I'm Warren county, part, people around good, I'm starting see lot ""muh freedumb"" types. Luckily, ShopRite worry free, least worry grocery shopping. Barbaric. Inhumane. Disgusting. Uncivilized. Etc. Take pick. happening modern world ""first world"" country. Kemp turning real piece fucking shit now. ABCNews dropped bombshell he's filing lawsuits prevent Atlanta area businesses.....from closing lockdown levels. Yup, lip service essential workers. Hey.. may minority us brains.. send help case, herd immunity achievable.

Why not? perfectly possible ton deaths get there, saying every person world got it, get herd immunity? countries filled Adult toddlers. That's difference. Kids gotta told eat vegetables. actually started March Canada I‚Äôm mistaken. Quebec Ontario went lockdown around March 15th, even considered late. Well, research shows kind inescapable shame makes weight problems worse, better...so that's goal it. know people find rude everyone's weight business. need talk dishonestly health consequences, strangers need hear specifically you. shown help accurate information support people network. again, seem hinting saying reason lie people's weight health? really I'm saying actually care, listen research says shaming harmful counterproductive. 

There difference honest discussions everyone ever see feeling like need lecture you. agree? goal feel superior lecture rather contribute solution? look like petite version Ivanka. wouldn‚Äôt turn away.... Can‚Äôt imagine difficulties faced single parent families. Even families spouses working going childcare difficulties fall/winter, don‚Äôt already. High earners hire nannies, otherwise, good luck. Daycares likely close short periods time due +covid tests, kids sent home often symptoms. hope employers understand this, I‚Äôm holding breath. 3 days ago like. Well it‚Äôs really good news death rates down! it‚Äôs good! We‚Äôre outstanding! 

If cases going kind imbecile doesn‚Äôt realize death rates soon follow? 

Not him. realize it. people it‚Äôs say get day. future, past. exists slant. Get schools open! get numbers even higher! ""Excess deaths raise concerns"" &lt; certainly hope would!  almost precisely backwards. response stores "" wait already there??!????"". interesting theory lockdown wasn‚Äôt prevent people going die end dying, it‚Äôs prevent ones saved dying lack ICU availability/staff.

The lockdown also give us time understand new virus develop treatments protocols already saving lives would lost otherwise. We're still learning. longer everyone avoid catching this, better outcome be. So. Basically fucked. reading article, that's exactly means. Yes I‚Äôm Canada, 343 billion dollar deficit coming.

According local manager, corporate left store decide. Exactly thinking. Every time I‚Äôve heard someone say, well study doctor says it‚Äôs going bad. Invariably, look study says person said, there‚Äôs bunch qualifiers like this. wear masks, abide social distancing measures, there‚Äôs community spread on. 

Nobody pays attention qualifiers even though they‚Äôre important bit.

Again, children going dying statistically (of course including exceptions), capacity pass others makes question state's decision reopen schools yet, like women, okay beat shit them. Yeah, teacher's complaints data representative. I‚Äôd think it‚Äôs better keep open safe way, let risk groups stay home pay keep kids school. Unless new data prevails.

I think Nordics working fine. distancing seems work caseloads overall country really low.

That‚Äôs increase 993 cases past 24 hours.

Officials say four additional people died, bringing total 428 deaths connected COVID-19.

Currently, officials say 546 people hospitalized confirmed suspected cases COVID-19.

Oklahoma Interim Commissioner Health Lance Frye says state currently plenty personal protective equipment hospitals across state, positive rate tested COVID-19 lower national average.

Right now, Frye says state 240 hospital beds available patients.

However, officials say majority cases 18 35-year-old age range, patients need hospitalized.

‚ÄúWe went crisis mode risk management mode‚Äù Frye said.

Although state leaders say watching data closely, Gov. Kevin Stitt says Oklahomans take precautions learn him.

Alicia Andrews, chair Oklahoma Democratic Party, released following statement:

‚ÄúThis horrible disease impacting lives every Oklahoman, whether personal loss family members, loss jobs, economic challenges. truly sorry Governor take necessary precautions protect family potentially fatal illness.

Frankly, concerned Governor announced Herman Cain hospitalized COVID-19. standing side-by-side, neither wearing masks social distancing, Trump rally Tulsa.

At meeting yesterday, Governor sat table Lieutenant Governor Secretary Agriculture. Even knowing virus, none state officials wearing masks. sincere hope Governor step leader need Oklahoma. mandates wearing masks public places state‚Äîand leads example‚Äîit certainly help protect lives every Oklahoman.

While continue pray Governor, must also encourage right thing Oklahomans.‚Äù Why?

And that's borders closed first time 100 years. 

I'm going backcountry camping week - know many steaming angry US people complaining able cross border?

The USA getting *as many Coronavirus cases day Canada EVER GOTTEN*. think want people literally spreading vulnerable rural communities, starting outbreaks cities, wanted buy fucking Canadian club? partner's job?

they can‚Äôt, won‚Äôt don‚Äôt. billy bob takes family 5 potentially exposing infecting virus that‚Äôs them. disney FL obviously aren‚Äôt prioritizing public health; clear now. 
IF people actually wear masks,  start seeing impact numbers 3-4 weeks. 
 Serious impact numbers 6 weeks. control virus 12 weeks. 
But people follow wear masks try distance. Thanks got around asking someone post article here. Keep mind private labs Florida (and elsewhere probably - happened CO March/April) report negative results all, positivity subsets incorrectly always 100%. read going run Challenge trial along Phase III. affect time reported deaths COVID comparison reported number infections New Jersey USA, example, works something like 8%. work? understanding something? Agreed 100% I'm fortunate husband wfh child stay task without ton supervision. reason we'll bite bullet keep home. One fewer vector teachers kids options. Schools primarily closed states. US data children reflect exposure school, aren‚Äôt attending. caught virus, likely caught family.

Compare countries schools remained open, studies showing COVID-positive kids spreading virus kids, however flu spreading. cases students catching COVID school, appears mostly traced back adult staff. americans gone crazy? Stay fuck away

-Canadian firm Orlando got done telling us Florida numbers bogus. new data source telling trust numbers. don‚Äôt care who‚Äôs numbers is, I‚Äôm staying home wearing mask leave. Fuck yeah Michigan! know guys crushed curve one two states dropping numbers one point. things standing now? anyone actually banned use masks? thought banned requiring use mask? apposed risking actual lives.....   he's dead right?

Stay home much possible wear mask go out. COVID-19 needs taken seriously. Let‚Äôs step game get behind us.

One manageable, not. 15 YO OK, 9 year old needs lot help supervision learning, least distance learning last spring. Maybe it‚Äôs retooled better luck feel like SOL Elementary age kid essential, healthcare need work outside home pay bills. right. many households that. jobs go to? Who's going watch kids? entire genre spawn pandemic like WW2 movies. know dead people pay bills. definitely passed making hospitals much money! otherwise parent need school open work keep paying rent food, regardless safety. It‚Äôs possible allergies COVID. could sneezing even infected. allergies don‚Äôt always mean sneezing, days nose stuffed don‚Äôt sneeze others I‚Äôll sneeze ton. saw sign front door week ago one side said masks manditory said masks reccomended they'sll flip sign Oh never complain. respect businesses decisions abide using services always have.

I would go far say wont let affect decision shop there. 2 grocery stores 1 requires masks 1 store prefer one requires masks still choose it.

I personally think bit much (people going crazy masks without care actual quality masks worn) roll it.

Again dont like government run business (even choice situation wear mask, still dont like state demanding it) I'm sure people realize good options - personal risk/reward outlooks choices.

In addition, many easily cast aside legitimate concerns surrounding issues coronavirus affect children, especially young children yet able form social bonds among peer groups.
 
Not mention families rely, better worse, public schools provide meals children safe place they're work.
 
It's easy boil everything *covid = bad*. many facets problem - early childhood development serious ramifications throughout lifespan - genuinely considered around here.

The number acceptable deaths teachers students zero. concerning found treatments yet keep people hospital. tools right require people go hospital (remdesivir IV only, dexamethasone helpful oxygen ventilator). get wrong, great reduce mortality this, still anything reduce severity it, reduce hospitalization rate, healthcare systems going vulnerable do. Covid hoax right? type angers see front line workers losing lives save lives yet folks running around refusing wear masks simply right refuse. Well guess front line heroes right live! looks like question me. poster ignorant please inform poster incorrect wrong track. 


But many positive outlook comments questions automatically downvoted without explanation information incorrect. like couple billion masks. Coronavirus: Florida reports second highest positive counts second highest tests done single day! Wow!

There chance trump expose himself, way demands people exposed. demands special protection himself.

""Safe"" ""unsafe"" purely matters judgement, scientist would use terms. That's idiotic. NY one states well overall. magic eight ball says: gonna happen. 

Several mayors sheriffs large city centers openly rejected mandate. People going wear masks lot them, they're far particular politician's ass believe Covid problem, they're scared straight, since there's punishment.

I doubts Texas going locked again. guess fully support paying taxes support special needs people entire lives then?

Belying ignorance law large numbers. Even outbreak accelerating, know upwards 1000 people know someone it. Covid enthusiasts Considering extremely high infection rates relatively low death numbers posted, I'm legitimately surprised this. affect state‚Äôs reporting numbers? No. per caption photo. died.

""Dr. Joseph Varon, top JV shield, leads team tried without success save life patient inside Coronavirus Unit United Memorial Medical Center,"" Even state (PA) requires masks stores, Walgreens one many places actually enforce customers.

How massive $720 billion military budget? $720 billion budget government uses commit war crimes perpetuate US global hegemony imperialism. Obviously none sounds like benefits American people way, yet $720 billion taxes go that.

Just cutting 10% budget could spent towards social safety programs could significantly benefit Americans, like UBI. would say actively hindered controlling virus. would better nothing rather actively help virus spread. Love it, feel like premature. Spain still 1000 cases day?

N95s easy use fit test done less 60 seconds. 

Home made masks great six months global pandemic better home made masks. N95s don‚Äôt even take six months start manufacturing basic respiratory protection.

According you, must already virus. point UK 1400 cases 65 deaths. lockdown made official 20th, laws came place fine people breaking lockdown. point UK 3600 cases 194 deaths. admitted hospital 2 half weeks later, 6th April. coronavirus symptoms - least - 21 days needing hospital treatment? average 10 days, would unusual case. 

Matt Hancock also got coronavirus time, recovered returned work Johnson worsened admitted hospital. also incredibly rare super extended time scale? 

Just context, I'm socialist hates Johnson, theory make sense, I'd rather criticise things actually rather things anyone lived March UK would know nonsense.

The main reason make sense though, UK prime minister approval things does, laws etc - like emergency ones put place enforce lockdown - voted parliament. [Coronavirus emergency laws enforce 'isolation' beginning put place early 10th unless really believe virus 2 months needing hospital treatment, way theory makes sense.  That's right. Domino effect mostly bankruptcies lately. narrow road all... airborne main reason I'm concerned focus reopening plan seems sanitizing surfaces, stopping spread wearing facial coverings. district really bad flu outbreak recent past I'm really surprised lazy reopening plan seems. Abbott: Wear mask lockdown.

Anti-Maskers: Nah. Make me.

These things preventable!

Stay inside. visit friend, stay OUTSIDE. wear mask! Goddamn think became pretty clear many people watching, many potential whistleblower would long paper trail would cooked numbers. Lockdown is, quick look comments Twitter Abbot mentions masks shows strategy probably work.  Everything I've heard talked young relating Covid risk ends usually translating 40 kinda assumed there. never influx like that. Since Fourth July, exploded.""

Oh, say... since Fourth July... hum... could possibly caused this? perplexed! states usually report late, addition Texas? everyone would know benghazi.  Since whole Wear Mask mandate working well think need go Plan B. Florida seems like death trap rn Somebody get poor girl fucking TV parent teacher: know, think teachers responsible entirety social safety net. Right time harass elected officials create relief. Many Americans ready strangle someone food ordered 10 minutes late. Disgusting information shared public. That's real scandal here. kills cells infected virus. Right trump visited too. would enforce mask wearing? think would harm good. understaffed rural police departments would keep people safe enforcing masks.

Or something like anyways, cant keep desantis anymore. People, sharing context headline. full quote might much better, side playing level. giving excuse shout ‚Äúfake news‚Äù. guarantee hear father say, ‚ÄúDid hear CNN said quote!? Cut halfway.‚Äù 

She meant, mind wrong, science get way this, science agrees us. Science says kids fine. Open schools. 

She isn‚Äôt saying ignore science, fake news. Sharing sharing fake news. 

What doing, lying scientists saying. lying here, saying ignore scientists. took actuary long figure out, they're piss-poor actuary want everything open banking people scared financial ruin furloughed people go back. care money.  depends focus, suppose. Canada's population small side, they're thinking locally several different options smaller scale might able contribute. approach also benefit including actual virus, seems major sticking point among potential users. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è can‚Äôt. opinion piece Man wear mask hang hospital bit convinces wear one. Like give 100 bucks whatever daily salary is, go local hospital choice video chilling 12 hours? thing can't put mask full duration challenge. call Trump 'I ain't frad hoax' anti mask freedom protest challenge. say enforcing mask wearing stores waste police resources, say that's job.

Wait second, cuisine culinary tradition amazing... though mostly black people. OK, music also great, soul, blues, jazz, folk... mostly black people. Um lot fantastic literature art came South... uhh, mostly depicting struggles black folks endured war preserve status property.

It's better wash hands regularly.

Gloves double-edged sword. Someone puts gloves gloves get dirty person keeps refusing throughout day (or longer) cross-contaminating everything gloves touch. never wash gloves. go barehanded, wash frequently, cross contaminate much less often.

""Why masks problem gloves?"" Simple enough. touch objects face/mask, even reuse mask day (or longer) rubbing door handles, shopping carts, on. well clubs bars open, I'm guessing there's probably bouncers looking work... case, fear 5'3"" Karen contesting 6'4"" 250lbs Mr. Bouncer.

For example Xu Xiaodong.

They blacklist certain things flight public travel. 

How get facts right.

And genocide documented people China. need get top brassin stores fucks see people making money deal Yeah, already spreading US February, remember coronavirus even getting mentioned talked super bowl party went to, talking friend's destination wedding coming May figuring plans that. wouldn‚Äôt consider 35 young. people he‚Äôs talking late teens/twenties. bossa nova.

All sports cancelled. going kill athletes well fans. Actual Headline: Target, CVS put sign front door requiring masks nationwide, nothing anyone needing actually wear mask look way employees like Home Depot Walmart. Fatality isn‚Äôt issue though.

Thanks sharing perspective. hope find peace soon loved ones stay safe. Lots love. wonder places deal enforcing it? Im saying shouldnt, think people comply asked them.

But multiple people door turning people away? Whole Foods offer mask without it?

I see select minority people think absurd want wear one, whatever reason. initial symptoms? Edited add hope fully recover soon. I'm sorry go this. No, state NJ earned gradual reopening. states surging cases go back square one. They‚Äôre problem. : (

The IRS said sort ""error"" latest round payments, \*hopefully\* receive end summer. Wtf. Get ready lockdown round 2. Let guess, populous counties state‚Äôs hospitals ICU beds too? won‚Äôt long rural communities hammered.

Great synopsis r/PublicFreakout r/FuckYouKaren gonna lit Bulllshiiiiit wear one Atlanta yesterday. mean, say need 70% long term immunity.

That said gonna gave lot vacancies God's waiting room matter what. sad see us aiming herd immunity seems...and overall unreasonable. guess I'll fall lower numbers side, doubt I'll get want.  Wrong, wrong, wrong.
Bye troll They‚Äôve also made lots progress identifying drugs treatments reduce severity symptoms PRICE NBA sports?

It causes havoc everywhere gives people lots little blood clots get tiny blood vessels organs body essentially give people ton mini strokes everywhere. Exactly. None explain increased excess mortality. try call chart fake, even though I'm using publicly available data CDC.

The willful ignorance level never wildest dreams thought possible. WTH??? make mandatory immediately? monday. I'm wondering something Japan, tests? Compare Chile example, double tests Japan ~10% total population

Japan 4,639 tests per 1 M

Chile 70,696 tests per 1 Well, that's good. yeah asymptomatic spread thing. think levels schools open probably contribute problem spring. Trump Twitter, nobody panic economy great stock market time highs. Everything okay one guy, orange one, said he's healthiest president ever been. must know something medical things feeling trump artificially deflate numbers cdc gag order, hospitals might release data numbers. lowers money spent available tests though, won‚Äôt confirmations virus definitive numbers give. worry later actual plan. he‚Äôs successful, would catastrophic. he‚Äôs extra successful, officially dictator another 4 years longer comes bull shit ways overthrow country.   think spend time Eastern Cape see relevant race. Also know well race part every policy country. BBBEEE, Land expropriation without compensation, farm murders given attention. think maybe don‚Äôt care don‚Äôt want see Racist country is. difference apartheid everyone suffering, black people included. might feel comfortable mention race much relevant topic country. Stop living shadows see actually going on. Look COVID policies see much sense make targeted ‚Äúwhite‚Äù businesses. mention Cuban doctors haven‚Äôt really brought much benefit cost millions. I‚Äôm anti-vaxxer, accurately don‚Äôt want one first hundreds thousands people take especially antibodies already. Let really marinate first. Here's thing:

The second wave 1918 pandemic deadly complacency, characteristics disease itself. places hit hardest people responded poorly, places *least* impacted first wave.

They thought exaggerated. thought immune. thought problem people deal with, ""us"". Whatever thought, clear trend second wave deadly places responded ""too well"" first.

Simply put: free face permanent, long-delayed consequences problem. know plenty people usually supporting science-based policy, right flouting even existing shutdown rules. well informed &amp; intelligent people, look current situation say, ""I care, cut back exposure plenty areas, going keep seeing people care about.""

I get that. deeply human. first wave really serious problem North East, basically nothing serious happened here. Doctors &amp; nurses even got laid elective procedures cancelled ""big bad virus wave"" never materialized. Unfortunately, indicators say *right now* we're experiencing infections create wave data showing newly *diagnosed* infections 3-4 weeks now. Unfortunately, everyone burned Coronavirus news people want even talk it, think understand situation don't, genuinely *do* understand situation starved life they're willing roll dice.

That real problem: going actually solve problem every region experienced terrible personal consequences, would people emotional energy handle that. people emotionally drained federal lockdown would actually induce opposite response: explicit rebellion popular embracing fatalistic ideology. think that's foolhardy &amp; think something people regret personally experience fallout colossal problem, truth.

The failure leadership goes beyond simple failure address problem quickly. continue fail instilling hope happier future reward job well done, without hope little chance popular movement could ever materialize.

That's gets farmers take arms soldiers. That's gets people butts action mode. That's gets politicians hordes followers seem totally immune reason. things, truth really matter, hope.

Before try force people lockdown, actually confidence lockdown would work, need hope comes visualizing life exists *after* control. Somebody sore embarrassed accomplished anything life beyond sizzling, white hot Reddit posts.

Yes Americans 40 % obese [60% overweight](http://www.healthdata.org/news-release/vast-majority-american-adults-are-overweight-or-obese-and-weight-growing-problem-among) add corona virus deaths 10-20 millions house order. think missing issue though. test works person needs vaccine first coronavirus see vaccine responds. cant use infected population already already antibody responses. Awww man. Let say something here: ICU nurse, absolutely love respect RTs I‚Äôve worked with. Many I‚Äôve worked entire career along side going different hospitals Houston. I‚Äôd devastated something happened one them. May RIP thank dear lady. Thank again. think something they've putting [water](http://www.aquagrade.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Trump-Ice-Natural-Spring-Water.jpg) America. It‚Äôs going hard hide refrigerator truck morgues hospital parking lots.

I wonder sorts statements though. Serious question: numbers news suppressed, much anyone notice this? people probably business hospital, would even see know trucks?

Seems people would case 'out sight, mind', right? combined artificially suppressed numbers, I'd bet people think we're great. Scary times ahead. that's best EVERYONE get vaccinated soon possible vaccine come out. I'm scientist medical expert, hard imagine bunch anti-vaccers could help virus mutate. Read Hitchhiker's Guide feel panicked. Maybe it'll make laugh!

Also, someone else said, take walk! Especially park people, open air, seems little risk kind scenario. walk local Metropark twice week. mostly stay popular paths think low risk get.

The people piling bars, going crowded parties, spending lots time socializing ones terrified. Stress mixed hypochondria. Yeah we‚Äôre gonna care say absolute dumbass. üèÖ Gonna run teachers pretty quickly. Grocery stores done things differently, I'm sure talking it. store employees converted ""pickers"". customers required order online (or ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE, phone). ""pickers"" would put together order, arrive, take load trunk.

That would DRASTICALLY reduced number bodies store. also would tightly-controlled going in, tested properly (and socially-distanced much possible, masked, etc) would heavily limited spread.

What grocery workers really unfair, nobody cares make $9 hour fired whim, nobody cares you. Still late this, either. That‚Äôs everyone though, one gets tested fun. kids adults terms percent positive, instead much higher indicates spread widely kids time brain can‚Äôt learn midst trauma. experiencing nationwide trauma survivors heal from. can‚Äôt creative think properly you‚Äôre scared. fuck kid expected learn midst death?

Let things like art music basically anything distract horror. school, place respite stress. pressure kids already extreme pressure, crack experience extremely severe psychological consequences may may ever recover from. brought every press conference? Hoover last week, Publix 31 near country club. sanitizing there. checked numbers Florida 3 times number cases entirety Canada. 
Ridiculous! first gut reaction ""what fuck? get sick we're full Arizona patients?"" hard solidarity especially news basically saying states full idiots basically infecting point. incredibly hard feel empathy situation. 

The second reaction ""come on, they're still people, deserve health care either"". I'm also worried coming somehow make situation worse here. families come stay (despite covid icu patients probably allowed visitors) continue refuse take precautions wear masks? spread around ICUs risk turn away people? 

It's scary, first thing brain wants confronted fear point finger someone, anger come protect us fear. RemindMe! 8 weeks agree more. Among circle seeing ppl losing last grain tolerance ppl. I'm seeing ppl try explain anymore, might see blowups like MI yesterday. That's different ways reporting, yes, confusing.

National data reports day cases confirmed PCR previous day updates data previous 7 14 days test result date date symptoms begin (correcting delays reporting).

The Catalan government reports system individualized data national reports done, releases also data includes PCR tests, antibody tests, probable cases (doctor diagnosis), always higher national report Catalu√±a shows. RemindMe! 2 weeks Maybe many have. triage strategy. result strategy. Everyone welcoming investigation that. I‚Äôve seen one saying anything other. Seemingly hasn‚Äôt occurred everywhere. 

Fair enough, except ""everyone"" bit: many deny may happened I've called conspiracy theorist citing prominent doctors said think happening articles DN Swedish medical magazines. masks, two danish friends coming back vacation Norway....

Yeah, really true mask problem pan Nordic. might interested article Politiken one person thinks situaiton like: TL;DR Danish authorities easing Danish populace masks totally cultural. Implementing mask requirement would take lot effort Nordics.

WHY? one explain except Nordic cultures small c conservative make abrupt changes unless to. That's best I've heard. Well let Texans flood mountain towns every weekend - can't worse that. least there's excuse knowing masks required mountain towns. Glad see patchwork local ordinances problem solved.

Although def mentioned limitations section. misleading say 139 title Well all, people participate activities with. like invite beers anything.

California loose interpretation 'friends' still weirds even living 20 years. Garbage in, garbage No. bring protests every thread regarding social distancing? fake reason ""because coronavirus!"" Probably best thing case contact GC. GC responsible construction safety construction job. work Target. lower mask breath fresh air every often... there's one else around. I've seen coworkers lowering whole shift one well-meaning guy trying get pull back up. Managers really care though seems. sucks really know *what* right ship. understand frustrated am, too. Every day, I'm paying attention news, getting information sorts different sources, seeing middle lower class getting screwed over. People expected put lives risk sake company's profits forced position work measly wage, end street. people able get work they'll end street matter do. None us affordable healthcare, they're trying force kids back school get sick parents pressured back work... Meanwhile police abusing anybody really stands even peacefully call anything question. see can't anything. feel like we're spot figure actual actions take, we're stuck. reasonable routes address issues closed us. dam break point know hell mean us. :/ big problem, bad leadership, bad long time. suddenly danger anymore. get memo? Fauci deal Catholic Italian-American Brooklyn clawing way administration headquartered Deep South dealing types pandemics stress job. He‚Äôs going anywhere fair, *lot* people ""not big deal"" camp ""not big deal"" camp along. stupid, they're consistently stupid switched ""sides"". can't imagine trump would unable put one place. provisions emergency measures, government effectively manage emergencies like this. know take action. He's empty windbag; talker, doer. true lol agree option isn‚Äôt everyone. everyone waited might well come anything covid would get worse. going wait taking means risk getting it. get idk I‚Äôll survive. Plus I‚Äôll spread elderly parents less chance surviving one able take care daughter. could change future worse. lot people lose lot life waiting isn‚Äôt best option. doubt anyone would release anything straight doesn‚Äôt work damage. would ruin companies (and countries) reputation, there‚Äôd law suits could potentially lose much money cant recover wanna make sure least works well enough. again, smarter person could probably tell I‚Äôm wrong. I‚Äôm expert, repeating I‚Äôve learned. country develops vaccine get first dibs, otherwise what‚Äôs incentive develop vaccine instead waiting someone else it? Abbott learnt stay home storm, won‚Äôt paralyzed back since 1984. 

History repeats 
/s Face shields protect eyes getting sprayed droplets.  Especially since public trust thing -- public health measures work, particularly virus, seemed totally unnecessary. *only* thing get people comply trust.  one trusts Trump - fair enough - put message out; Fauci Adams did. known better. logic correct either. 

 Yes, humans, differences us mean viruses affect us different. example, people sickle cell (primarily black) myriad issues associated sickle cell, susceptible malaria. 

I doctor, understanding coronavirus attracts particular receptor. number receptors increased age. 

So children definitely contract covid, less likely older populations. Ugh. That‚Äôs so, dangerous. idiot republican politicians literally gambling lives constituents political gain - keeping riled masks protests. Like - people see it? Sorry typo. made laugh hard though take upvote always, ALWAYS political party? Can‚Äôt think independently outside party? unable see parties play people sides? 

Does always stupid name try insult people? Demofats?? even mean?


Stop acting like one set peoples problem realize it‚Äôs ours. you‚Äôre wondering I‚Äôm independent. I'm familiar city southeastern part state. sparkling gem city Southwestern Pennsylvania. Yes I‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs seemingly reality. Competent governance absent USA right now, competent public servants schools CDC ignored. gotcha man. Idk didnt host AP-ASM filled position soon got rid greeters they're testing humans first, test monkeys, mice on./s

but yes, according [animal test animals humans. excited I‚Äôve ever Monday, guys. Actually, srore use walkie talkie call one managers handle situation. hourly employees supposed it. course regular floor supervisor stuff monitor face masks. awful. I'm hoping husband's school get pushed back too! understand guarantee anything speculation.

However, see speculation daily upvoted bearish bad news speculation. businesses like wal mart done get go, leadership asking us pitch instead calling hoax, might this. Sorry updated lol. surprise me. wearing one running thought may impact oxygen levels.

Does hold exercise stresses running? Basically they're afraid want everything ""normal"" without give reality. 100 percent think going tohappen. friends disagree long take. Can't wait new posts publicfreakout lag also took longer due 2 reasons. One younger people getting infected first. Two, infections rose earlier knew back March.  So, I'm curious.

I sat back computer realized made typo link address. linking dead page, yet got three responses anyways telling post was, words, ""wishful thinking.""

How long take actually click link read it? less 30 seconds? agree. basically wanted see here- real discussion free personal attacks. appreciate one person somewhat opposing side stepped up, respectfully. 

I tend see mask way protecting others me. I'm healthy I'll probably fine get it, again, maybe not. However, folks much higher risk can't stay locked forever. I'm going whatever protect me.

Now, happen standing near (properly distanced, course) carrier store, person's mask prevents enough virus reaching get sick, well, that's great too. sign healthy citizenry working together toward common goal. us pulling weight, eye toward looking one another- part makes strong successful society? 

I'm particularly interested I've reading Japan. Apparently well, cultural masks norm. Admittedly need read more, seems something going there. Apparently Republicans state house already tried impeaching blocking orders. Supreme court backed Wolf. dad threw line. 

I pointed virus like 50x size methane molecule. ""Fuckin-a dad one taught critical thinking skills."" protests over. peaceful protesting constitutional right, going beach not. course COVID won‚Äôt distinguish protesting going beach one much important other. comparison. Nobody saying protests didn‚Äôt contribute rise cases. states hadn‚Äôt started opening wouldn‚Äôt right now, regardless protesting.

Ah, future one simply says ""karma"" know begging upvote? red onions. consistently get \~60-70% order. get wrong - I'm grateful even option curbside..but c'mon..we're FOUR MONTHS pandemic. Surely supply chains caught initial surge demand.

Yeast, flour, toilet paper, etc stock? OK..I see that. red onion? Chicken? ICE CREAM?

I ordered 2% Simple Truth milk last time..got text saying ""out stock"". call store stock things ask double check. Lo behold - picked order, get two half gallons 2% milk requested, get ONE 1-gallon container - would gotten called store said..""are SURE 2% milk can't substitute ANYTHING?"" first, said..""sorry - stock 2% Simple Truth milk"". basically even LOOK see if, hey..maybe HALF gallons, golly, FULL gallons - exact damned thing. even TRY substitute, even though said ""ANY"" 2% milk would OK - quantity.

Another time..I requested Kroger Deluxe Churned Ice Cream several flavors - let's call Flavor Flavor B. Got message..we're Flavor A..no substitutes available (darn). OK..went next one. We're Flavor B. Would like substitute Flavor A? (HUH?!)

I contend pickup system BROKEN (by large). get things (yeast, flour, toilet paper) high demand. I've tried order sunflower seeds 2 months now. NEVER stock. last 4 times, claim stock (doubtful pandemic inspired ""run"" sunflower seeds)..instead, suspect computer probably wrong location stored picker can't find them. stuff like that..makes crazy. death could declared pneumonia coroner release even hearing test they're running cold storage. I'd take debating whether seek medical treatment risk bankruptcy catching illness. Virginia gives fucks. Unfortunately people never learn. course. wearing mask suppressing sneezing, right? People getting people's faces screaming put mask they're worried sneezing. Because, that'd pretty stupid. 
Try one: Sneeze car windows versus sneezing mask inside store standing next people. one safer? fuck .... sources specific statistics? It‚Äôs changing though younger generations millennials. seems problematic decade 2 ago - especially nationalism. They‚Äôre going cultural shift. completely hear saying, Fauci terrible position. However, administration actually intercepting data COVID-19 [before ever gets administration absolutely lie us anything everything, including vital COVID-19 data. Without Fauci White House team, things would much worse already are. 

While hated see good people stepping protest, resigning, retiring, whatever, afraid would happen Fauci, particular, provide actual trustworthy information. 

For part, *all vote* *November 3* sign online petition Biden award Fauci Medal Honor stand administration's campaign misinformation.

It would bad us Fauci resigns fired. Something people realize everybody WFH productively others. gets really boring monotonous. WFH, pets, spouse, kids behind time. home work life collide. people need stimulation going office every weekday. Point blank. Full time WFH post-pandemic discrimination towards ADHD people. wife LMT well. WAY working field anytime soon! Stay safe there. Texas shithole. product ""latch key"" kid times dating back 70's!!! home alone 3:30 til 6pm think back &amp; thinking crazy reliable neighbors etc. back lol Anyone know flu vaccines start going sale? (I know covered insurance know else call it). gotten one since kid want get one year case. Flu covid time sounds horrible. Considering Walmart also that... I'm wondering long it'll take Target, place work, so. LOL imagine pathetic think anyone votes Trump danger society. Comedy gold.

Just promise hard temper tantrum Trump wins again! üòÇ  look countries doing. control detect stop new flare ups. Man three perfectly good names use last name Pound chooses Dick. Respect. Jul 22, today? friend post ""it's just"" list, ending ""it's just"" way planned it.

I took bait. ""Ok. 'They' who? Also, why?"" 

Guess got left barrage? ever say okay?

Edit: guess get make whatever get downvoted away. Nice.... that's honest dialog things. anti science attitude complete Ng social media, heavily manipulated China Russia...need say ? It‚Äôs little less, much. Florida releases current hospitalizations now, gives better picture anyway. Ivey even finish announcing saying enforce it. I'm sure crossed paths COVID-19. five days got back President Donald Trump's rally Tulsa, Oklahoma, hit brick wall.

Uhhhh....I‚Äôll take fairly decent **I expecting nurse conducted test car window wearing mask even cover nose.** spoke volumes.

This can‚Äôt nice things. Walmart new mask rule, fucking r/publicfreakout literally catch fire. Beyond pale. Grotesque even.

Why don‚Äôt stay home? Quick simple fix appears impotent rage. whataboutism contribute discussion. like old practice sentencing suicidal survivors death trying take life. 5 weeks may slightly longer end spectrum, could easily happen. Think it:

1 week symptoms develop

1 week symptom development hospitalization

2 week hospital stay. People struggle ventilators quite time ultimately die.

1 week death reported (this indeed average time takes report death US reported much later backlogs) everyone Texas air conditioning. Schools provide places kids cool off. parents would rather kids school heat summer get time Spring Break require customers wearing unsoiled clothes too? Except true. Fauci repeatedly stated virus impacted warm weather. Barely anyone wearing I‚Äôm wearing one, get weird looks  shit illegal wtf probably areas orders wear masks telling employees enforce mask order, ask customers leave, talk customers wearing masks. caught bunch shit making big show walking back original stance masks. trust Fred Meyers/Kroger, optics. 

They also made big song dance reducing capacity stores, know reduced capacity to? 50% stores original capacity. sounds good take account decided square footage building (including store rooms customers access to). means local Fred Meyers allowing 1500 people store instead usual maximum capacity 3000. limit high even bother enforcing it.  Yep, make even worse, place basically frat house elderly, old folks getting Villages, nasty think about. 40% still support administration unbelievable I'm area....wally world first ever thought parents can‚Äôt fathom thought kids go back, they‚Äôre ill equipped take care would rather pawn system?  largest supermarket chain

I idea true I‚Äôm expert. I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre either. Abbott, guy trying hide metrics make everything seem rosy, said last weekend death numbers seeing late may. wouldn‚Äôt make go stance don‚Äôt let face-naked.

Just provide reasonable accommodation disability prevents wearing mask complying store safety policies. Kroger needs point online shopping curbside pickup functions. maybe offer refund curbside fee Oh meant wore mask. Nvm happened us. first set tests back yet since July 2, family member positive (tested elsewhere). Irate school director threatened legal action audacity presume positive proof. Also school director take late tests proof students positive whilst school. still able trust nationwide death toll? mask take completely better eat droppings? bitten back, always believe somehow victim use vast resources bellow much rooftops. Trump thinks popular vote, contest given rules, however messed are.

I agree Fauci saved lives, Fauci doesn‚Äôt work Trump, Trump can‚Äôt fire him. unique position right thing without employment immediately terminated president. glad Fauci job, unique position orbit administration. Pretty much Wrong answer. Maybe use harsh language coronavirus reconsider could base twitch channel around People buying things stores aren‚Äôt tested multiple times week forced stay bubble. Glad infective rate stable but...it summer..people gathering more. wish would mandate masks instead recommending. list things country meeds, none comes clue. knows Trump probably gone 6 months covid19 probably won't. cop Damn 7 months late. close. Yeehaw  People won‚Äôt even wear mask hospital - think they‚Äôre going Walmart? HAH. I‚Äôm full rocking Jeffrey Lebowski look point. Unfortunately, yeah, kinda. Particularly get backed up. Actual humans still guess records office prepared deal sheer number Pandemic deaths coming in. multiply # people infected get tested, conservatively, probably 1.25, maybe even 1.75-2.0.

And multiply r0, estimated 2.0, divide 100.... get us to:

(64,700 infections X 1.25 non-test multiplier X 2.0 r0) / 100 rate deaths = \~1600 die, infections counted 7/14/20.

&amp;#x200B;

Yikes. Ever, infact. Shit barbaric. F.A.T. (florida arizona texas) move game Duke University, like January, 1942. That's exactly last thing country needs. note future self, introduce harsher truancy penalties pretend unrelated think fear unemployment application. kind person looks forward unemployment application? Millions upon millions Americans get vaccinated flu season. Also already 2x many deaths covid doesn‚Äôt appear seasonal. Hospitals don‚Äôt run supplies beds fighting flu Man, super proud local Menards getting wagon early sticking it. fresh bleached shopping baskets ruin pair kahkis, turned chore pants care less. hardware store I've shopped since onset I'm happy I'm supporting one company going beyond keep customers safe.

I'm waiting Big One finally hit California August. literally came tv put us Ohio time-out. Thanks dad. something instead? think morons gonna listen now? explanation I've heard hot parts states august kids better air conditioned schools. creepy dig someone's post history can't wait visit Wal-Mart. I'll show day see many jackasses cry Communism Nazis. Yeah get saying, I'm guy complaining fyi, making hypothetical point health office zero power anything. course did...  Well... We're thread article makes correlation one's intelligence ability respect covid measures.

We've watched daily protests BLM movement, many protests blatent disregard social distancing covid measures.

Ergo, relevant.

Doesn't mean true, appropriate, whatever.

How relevant? Americans really thinking whole country full lumberjacks sod houses. Trump gets re-elected, we‚Äôll pushing four years six months minimum... Masked Lives Matter think people Texas understand. I've seen people 2 different people testing positive 5 weeks initial positive result. hospitalized briefly continued test positive weeks discharged.   What? required time? LOL. can't even go street without mask. Meanwhile, worldometers showing USA second highest daily infection count far, fatality count 139,999 - reach new milestone. Well escalated quickly. get . religion prohibits masks vaccines also religious exemptions . someone explain could beneficial?

Was CDC data really lagging week? reason actually way speed things different organization? actually proof USA used CDC data inform decisions? Publix Russia communist thirty years.

China claims communist. even capitalist United States. Nobody needs football... Disclaimer: HR living, advanced degrees, never studied fun. said...

They dug small mountain data concerning specific immune system responses, correlated disease severity. result mathematical wizardry seems suggest 3 different overall types responses human immune systems make COVID-19. Different people react different ways. 

Within subsets, able find strong correlations certain levels X body, severity symptoms time test done. could point specific blood work doctors could determine patient going getting better worse near future (""Oh no, level X increasing, that's bad sign!"")

Basically, solid framework future research build of. facts story wrong correct links? trolling? completed phase 1

Releasing phase 3 believe, appears lost translation

""Around 14-15 August, hope, small amount vaccine able produce enter public circulation"".

""The soonest launch industrial production fall, phases trials go perfectly well"" mean, China already exactly Trump admin doing, built system. They're masters sort bullshit. Unfortunately Trump decided take notes decided good idea.

Just Trump horrible mean China also. either/or. don‚Äôt know, lives citizens world Florida, America, even relevant everything type discussions come up? rest world benchmark covid strategies well Americans doing. hated work home first. can't stand office. many side conversations programs ends sucking time day. Man, Soros guy shit eh  everyone downplays saying preexisting conditions fine look realize preexisting condition. Data limited, vast majority people recover fully. said, still avoid catching it. doubt it, hence comment.

Oh cool. work federal government know single thing talking about. Keep pretending! rest us continue call every time. Texan here, we'd like send comedy duo Abbot Patrick visit nice state. Maybe keep em well. love Americans try weasel responsibility. president, chosen country. Since May 30 cases doubled. Seems pretty likely seeing transmissions early June deaths now.

That course get reliable data. Governor DeathSentence Florida.

Governor Asshat Texas.

Anyone got something better? live literally guy outside monitoring people entering grocery store. must wearing mask enter. 10 years ago, since then, specialist finally found right meds get path remission.   used specific hand sanitizer barely ever used em hands dried bad could fists blood. like couple months. turn even one person, still victory. r/peopleofwalmart Even wanted guess else requires masks? expect current level enforcement continue? think precursor shutting things down. days probably say situation improved. warning. aren‚Äôt even close herd immunity NYC. need 70% population immune (per Johns Hopkins) 

They know handle Covid better April. see, hopefully speed it‚Äôs deemed safe varies different employers, am, employee tested positive Covid, employees may contact individual notified someone workplace tested positive. information provided, names, etc. wear condom times. Never safe. think I‚Äôm drill sergeant telling put effort comments, says me.

JFK left darling would considered conservative today. manufacturing distribution actually hard part, they've already started manufacturing vaccines. proving work that's hard, requires large sample size long duration study thought moderna's caused adverse affects half people given vaccine? they've given 45 people. I've said friends family beginning revelant whether man made natural virus. I'm eating words something natural evolve leap far itself.

Ya think smarter scientists wrote thing posted. dunno. ideas I'm hearing put forth left hardly right leaning. ideas late (especially since protests) quite left. Moreso I've ever seen heard history.

I suppose matter perspective, feel though side moving farther center. Left left, right right. 

Meanwhile whole lot us middle abandoned. Much like middle class, guess.  Pesky science don't. limit compromise. point, considering puling 1984 people wearing mask easier. take picture, adding text post social media. government force change, let social pressure good work once. sounds like US back late March. flat made symptoms try get test time still age told person could deliver groceries obese father cancer. mortality rate surpasses U.S.

Say what?

The total covid-19 deaths/capita always higher Sweden US. wording makes sound like kind new development, false: current *daily* reported deaths/capita higher US Sweden, US surpassed Sweden last week. exact opposite wording article: incredibly tired weasel-worded articles like this.

EDIT: idiocy Lofven, seen popularity flag Sweden‚Äôs decision impose proper lockdown followed spike deaths

No, exact *opposite* happened. L√∂fven's popularity increased time death rate highest! back normal levels again, months peak death despite much higher rates exposure coronavirus Sweden many places, immunity remains elusive.

THEN FUCK DEATH RATE CASE RATE GOING DOWN?!?!?

Mobility steadily increasing, restrictions lifted bit, yet virus numbers going down. Sweden certainly at-risk people would die caught virus, yet streets full zombies. Why? God take pity Sweden decide wipe virus? Swedish people putting show *actually* locking super hard no-one looking? Swedish people wearing invisible face masks? Swedish people actually dying huge numbers, they're hidden freezer?

Reality staring everyone face, people still going ""no no, there's immunity Sweden"".

Ok, then, hell going on? Please present alternative explanation. also totally compatible lockdown. outdoor classrooms? worry more, there‚Äôs process called ‚Äúvaccine trials‚Äù!

What fucknugget. dies pneumonia July Donny told Forsythia cure... Rural suburban spaces dangerous pandemic dense city. Rural spaces dangerous share one store (usually Walmart 100 miles) everyone congregates. One study found suburbs dangerous due people driving county county daily.  comparisons could provide context understanding scale deaths caused writing, 130,000 people died COVID-19, total could grow 200,000 fall. numbers big, they‚Äôre hard grasp. Stadium Ann Arbor largest football stadium United States. holds 107,420 people, football stadium country large enough hold everyone died COVID-19 thus far. time bowl season comes along, assuming football season year, number COVID-19 fatalities likely exceed capacity Rose Cotton bowl stadiums state Wyoming population slightly less 600,000 people, it‚Äôs equivalent one every five people state dying last four months. fall, COVID-19 death total equivalent fully one-third people Wyoming dying. populations Grand Rapids, Michigan; Huntsville, Alabama; Salt Lake City, Utah 200,000 people. Imagine everyone one cities died course six months. That‚Äôs COVID-19 may look like fall. get letting invisible hand guide decisions done state Wow. came ask exact question. cares information? bad? Yeah, kind pointless speaking point begin with, since death lags infection (usually there's sort fight keel over).

Short-sighted too, since eventually speaking points reflect deaths even infections suddenly dropped zero. DeSantis:

We tried everything, none worked. ideas worst kind leadership, one looks blame. Start fixing, something Maybe not. people expect around 9 months care. Imagine NY NJ resident national lock put place south cant handle shit. remain state-by-state Mid april: ~90 / day

Numbers FHM, freakouts shall epic many many cancer breakthroughs. cured every form cancer? No. increased survival rates cancers previously killed almost everyone it? Yes, that's breakthrough Again, others didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúmasks need preserved healthcare workers‚Äù straight LIED said masks don‚Äôt work (and surgeon general even said masks made WORSE). could encouraged people preserve masks healthcare workers without lying, chose mislead instead. That‚Äôs fucked matter noble intentions. 

History shows time time lying people (even ‚Äúgreater good‚Äù) horrible strategy building long-term trust. Fauci &amp; Co‚Äôs actions, people don‚Äôt trust anything say anymore. they? They‚Äôve proven untrustworthy, long-term damage inflicted reputation vastly outdoes short-term benefit got preserving masks. History look kindly upon them. Bro supposed get Alaska! right. Yep bothers me. Much? No. tend avoid things bother general. amount bothersomeness doesnt really matter.

Entitled what? left alone? bothered another inconvenience absolute shitload running show caused? keep normal life? Oh hell yeah am. may temporary profit increase due MLR (Medical Loss Ratio), pay enough claims, rebate groups/members end year.  part ACA (Obamacare) law.  Also, give groups statement credit July bill reduced cost would show Q3 financials. Late NY caught guard initially. population density made virus spread like wildfire. took aggressive measures successfully curbed spread. states surging excuse. caught guard. KNEW coming. 

The US whole handled pandemic poorly.  It‚Äôs horrifying many republicans think people nursing homes expendable. Ghouls. productivity decrease least 25-30% return office. Thats OK though...i work home night work actually get work done make work commute open office every day... Begun Karen Wars Shit pissed test UK took 3 days come back (not mine). countries results wait! many still refuse. Infuriating. Fuck Walmart. Assholes care before. Quit supporting Chinese slave labor. Wake America! Yeah, history athlete. I‚Äôm driving sober, also don‚Äôt care someone chooses drive drunk.

LA county 10 million people living space smaller size Connecticut probably robust transparent testing system country outside NYC. Taking account, per capita numbers definitely still bad nowhere near disaster we‚Äôre seeing states. feel guilty!!!! Take care YOU!!! Oh caught update yesterday! entire thing ego trip many levels. told customer needed leave cause sidewalk pick-up only. sign door said. Immediately screams ""you treat like fucking child!"" 

Like...bruh. Calm hell down. quit acting like fuckin child. People forced face always pretty. I'm genuinely convinced self-reflection actually causes people brain pain. ""Not gone according plan""

Apparently pretending pandemic exist work. Noted. Trump made problem, governor would like make city mayors take over. rolls downhill. wear mask wear mask. Regardless symptoms lack thereof. garbage we've seen it? conspiracy happening?

[Here's article showing 33,000 incorrect another showing labs reporting comprehensive another, statement CDC, showing cases likely 10 times higher reports show, would drive fatlity rate CDC also encouraged states report probable, unconfirmed cases recent June several different viruses cause similar symptoms. Reporting new COVID-19 cases blantant negligence.

[Here's article showing several states lumping anti-body results active instances, person longer contagious, still reported ""new case"". Technically correct, misleading.

I work auditor distribution center. report failed audits run. report instances occur I'm present. They're happening, I'm witness them.

If we're seeing numbers reported properly 33,000 tests turning incorrect results, seeing?

I'm conspiracist anti-Fauci. I'm anti-lying-to-the-public. happened nicer asshole. Real question what‚Äôs wrong people. one mandating work. Good. heard BLM protest don‚Äôt spread virus cause people wore mask outside. Disney fine that‚Äôs case.

Edit: double standards hypocrisy laughable. assume responsibility? choice. He‚Äôs without Snickers. It‚Äôs ridiculous idea family member works FEMA called said this? absolutely believe mentioned before, family friend could easily gotten information god knows where. Maybe they‚Äôre one people rumor spread around fact. simply came asking information anyone heard anything similar. trying spread BS. immediately? wait week. sooner cut transmission, better.

Oh, house fire. I'll announce I'll put week... going take business dollar general big lots earlier post didnt see taking fmla later...dont worry zero notice!!! Look CAREs act...hope works out!!! love Canada. keep shut. Keep everyone safe. Don‚Äôt let us in. instead Monday, it‚Äôs fucking INSTANT. insane recognize major issue let many people get infected waiting days What's happening?

My state put new restrictions place. dont see restaurants survive. Yep. see working well enough enough political pressure put Astra Zenca release produced ASAP. Enough people hot spots brave enough take vaccine numbers start dropping fast. already thing??? No, jmintheworld. gives facts articles dislike debunk whole ""PARNICK!"" nonsense.

Stop attacking posting legitimate news articles take issue 'facts' exposed somewhat manipulated 'massaged' saying goes.  Walmart required masks since early April what. I‚Äôm California though makes sense know solution taken throughout history... Georgia.. helping make South Carolina look like slightly less shit-show ü§£ 115000 deaths 30 younger 15. source get ‚ÄúImagine That‚Äù take kits idea. ways Trump awful, legion, would expected executive background sense deal problem like this. Another failure. Oh cute precious. really think people believed ever stopped believing it. ü§£ Okay....where buy these?? happen one meeting people start coughing form protest. Slowly first, crescendo. I'm well aware timeline. know think arguing me, arent saying anything different am. Fauci changed tune fairly quickly, precisely reason stated. surgeon general continued fairly recently say masks nothing actually increased risk he's lying Trump lackey. least Fauci somewhat noble intentions initial statements. denialism get Trump re-elected. zero benefit public health (in view, protecting lives doctors nurses average citizen still net benefit public health). Ah gotcha figured such. option presumably would keep folks admitted hospital tested negative, hospitals space staff ""house"" people needed skilled care. would create SNF ward hospital keep everyone well enough discharged. Really sure anyone vehemently criticises choice knows anything hospital care SNF care. two reasons:

1) deaths lag lot;

2) likely still lot cases NY back then. lack testing means 15k confirmed tests Florida Texas means lot fewer infected people 15k confirmed NY back much testing. Thankfully store enforcing weeks now. Downvotes don‚Äôt change facts... real question masks political. argument proscience versus antiscience.

Dem vs GOP = proscience vs antiscience  Yep. like working sporting events. contracts. Unless mask goes nose *and* chin.... That's literally 0.04% population. serious. I'm going sort controversial, wish luck on? even considering delay certifying reporting deaths. deaths see numbers today least week ago. wife 2 kids, another way. worldometers time cutoff day different! Oh can't fucking wait videos everyday affair now..... New record day day unless everyone wears masks. actions aren‚Äôt taken all, it‚Äôs full power pandemic could take 5,000 day. December half states gonna NY level outbreaks. Oh I'm sorry, realise one morons. Feel free actually read CDC report. Kentuckians know they're get hung dry. Smart move. need trained experienced nursing respiratory staff care icu patients. Bad things happen that‚Äôs case. icu nurse requires additional training learn school. It‚Äôs something learn week Sure, Olympics - they're money-hungry compared every sport ever combined. Plus host cities need able make money back, spectator-less Olympics even bigger drain national resources compared eating preparation costs Games all. Oh blame toddlers alright, ones daycare. goofy considering nursing home deaths. nicely worked well far...... 

People mindset that. what's plan, say smarter them? seen videos people savagely attacked politely asked someone wear mask.

I point I've seen plenty opposite. 7 billion people Earth, using videos examples either searched fed communities share views means virtually nothing. last ~~20~~ 160 years.

FTFY Yes, also ‚Äúwe aren‚Äôt even Georgia‚Äù lady Here's Texas' latest case/death charts: 7-day running average deaths look promising. ones coming shop probably heading pharmacy get medicine lower price get hosed USA. people voted sold drug companies health services industry. fair, smokers alcoholics ones bars beaches. Mass deaths 'll that, eventually, unless Republican DC. U better not, PA ass stuck here.....  Controlling flow information.

Oh yeah...fascist. Certainly hypocritical least. asshat literally even slightest iota inkling idea rigorous standards proof people STEM field work within **at times**.

So arrogantly stupid makes blood boil. Four decades life still figured yet, lol raises question: many masks physically put can't breathe anymore? don‚Äôt see people aren‚Äôt wearing already. wear damn thing. Since literally everyone lying one way another, there's really reliable place get information, I'll ask make decisions based responses - far away widely available vaccine? say like it‚Äôs already control Florida. Please resign. world needs ever! mean, people desperate enough go bar pandemic probably dependency issues. Weighted population todays report LA would like FL reporting 6k cases.

Also, I‚Äôm driving know risk drivers drunk.I‚Äôm also laws road blocks place keep drunk drivers road. However someone drives drunk that‚Äôs choice must deal consequences. There‚Äôs nothing personally keep drunk drivers road.

Similarly choose go public areas present day know everyone wearing mask thats something I‚Äôm ok with. OK would go places. Ok? Nowhere article people thread talking masks functioning respiratory PPE. Anti-science Russia/China... homegrown predates social media. 

Look American media portrayal... Here's sample , America's devaluation science intelligence long deep history. anything got better advent computers internet. Except that‚Äôs happened state sucks.  don‚Äôt see would CDCs fault case, wouldn‚Äôt blame entirely labs hospitals reporting negative tests, what‚Äôs going change here? July 15th? Meaning, today. agree certain levels (congress). hard time seeing go sideways US last 6 presidents I‚Äôve alive for. signs past weekend nobody doors enforcing. People walked mask, took store, halfassed checkout. wearing mask properly - chin mask, mouth mask (nose exposed), masks fit right. Jesus Christ. Might well run around kissing random people mouth. Well he‚Äôs got now, let‚Äôs see happens wakes all. Training major company. Sorry can't come respose...btw shoulda read info ;) live Brooklyn i‚Äôm definitely disinfecting mail reading üôÉ always knew people think future , expect bad people even think 2 weeks ahead. Oh, love unborn: deal moral complications helping poor people, people addicted drugs, people jail. ""apologize"" unborn politically correct. unborn ask anything might hurt wealth, power, privilege. racial baggage much hate. care happens they're born - dead moment on. Now, think people jesus cared: sick, poor, orphaned, imprisoned, immigrants - yeah, *those* people. Fuck 'em, there's fetus danger ""murdered."" 

FUCK pro-life stance. That's science works all. study applicable completely set conditions conducted instated culture, rules, regulations yes would far applicable. I'll give example. working pharmaceuticals create product manufacturing/testing site prove FDA produce product x location properly test quality control. even within company. want produce L.A., Chicago, NYC address would prove safe location things always consistent across board.   say large.

Because I'm fat. forget plowed parts Central Asia Middle East first. ..what fuck Kroger a√ßab firefighters don‚Äôt smoke. yea could faulty girlfriend registers around 98% it. 

I‚Äôve always occasional problems getting winded hiking such. Guess I‚Äôll get checked sure enough Guardsmen kinda thing. They'd posted practically every store. point equate murder slash manslaughter? San Antonio-born here, confirm would work Unless quarantining people entirely two weeks prior seeing parents, gotten recent negative test covid, absolutely wear mask entire time parent's home. wear masks well. Yes sleeping too. think people uncomfortable voting democrat happened party past 4/5 years. know people ""supporters"" Trump, terrified Biden presidency, seeing party declined adopted right corruption. #unity2020 gaining traction, might saving grace. Sorry facts scary you. It'll done graphs using sharpie! seeing chaos shifting major system data gathering caused. given things state hampered lack coordination top. say confidence fuck things. slow cause chaos many offices. And, time many medical systems overloaded, it‚Äôs favors 

There difference find web, via search, interconnections big agencies thought so. reading cdc site claimed someone could leave isolation 10 days 3 days fever. thought seemed weird compared everything I‚Äôd heard prior anyone believe wont lie us again? wasnt misstep. intentional allow Wal-Mart sell essential goods?

Every company forced close sells things Wal-Mart legal standing sue state, absolutely damages.

It‚Äôs issue closing bars allowing restaurants also serve alcohol remain open.

Unequal protection law possibly interstate commerce clauses. depends old parents are. older 70 maybe obese would carefull 50 thin. care get banned inciting violence. Can't throw motherfucker ICU sick patients force stay changes mind? Look totally agree wearing mask stupid, calling people wear masks stupid counterproductive. even less inclined hear reason start defensive. want convince someone wrong, better start showing respect.

Outrage people inconsiderate of, endangering others totally understandable, way move forward productively love, peace kindness.  ?? STILL 40% approval. Literally right initial election.

I know world live America seen light unilaterally rejects Trump, ain't happening. Desantis resign. guy idea he's (or give damn Floridians). was. too. Please go volunteer hospital. likely contract work city. would ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù? needs get groceries basic needs well. Im pretty sure someone works hospital would know clean sanitize leaving workplace. Theres also need call doctors nurses dangerous risking helping infected. say told RCMP notify Americans camping imagine across country. campsites supposed open BC residents only. Freedom say please, thank excuse me? Freedom spit face? Freedom take dump public? Freedom wear pants? Freedom kiss sex individual? selective. 

There‚Äôs infinite list ‚Äúfreedoms‚Äù society doesn‚Äôt agree it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot proper‚Äù. Wearing mask different. Shut F up, Donny. highly recommend running neck gaiter. Won‚Äôt shit protect stop micro-droplets you‚Äôre sick.

Knoxville elected pro-wrestler county mayor, so... Imagine writing essays everyday, people losers XD hospital 400 kids hospitalized far, last month. thinking returning something need let go 90 days. gonna make people wear masks, think go since safer. idea let return 90 days? wondering section? Wtf u talking about? thing read bullshit comment tinfoil hats obviously anyone bend government tinfoil guy, right? well gonna interview new campaign manager that‚Äôs definitely sold time shake things up. Pleas let tucker. Imagine tucker stepping becoming campaign manager trump turning last weeks ? goes effect employees confront anyone. I've asked to. get want get beat though, occasionally risk it. never maskless person change mind though. Sounds Chinese me... Trump indisputably become mass murderer. far I'm concerned, he's responsible 100,000+ deaths. He's worse keeping hands folded lap. He's actively going way insure additional deaths. Part problem Democrats don‚Äôt want intervene. quite happy stand watch Orange Peril fuck everything kills thousands Americans good chance winning election. \*populace   said, troops coming home help spread infection, far know. live masks went mandatory everywhere last week. Walmart, Sams Club Kroger make one entrance exit someone letting people store. don‚Äôt mask turned away. consider mainstream media everyone call Russian Collusion investigation hoax, said Trump lying Obama spied him.  Lol know you‚Äôre losing start calling progressive neoliberal üòÇ you‚Äôre one spewing conservative nonsense need worried debt üòÇ

The data speaks itself. Highest income world. Cheaper housing market developed country. Robust economy low unemployment (pre Covid) compared Europe. You‚Äôre bullshit lies won‚Äôt change Already preparing tell ""couldn't seen coming"" economy even worse 3 months.

It‚Äôs almost never made prediction stared facts - there‚Äôs remarkable economic turn around two months incredibly encouraging. You‚Äôd moron say otherwise. Oh wait... Imo

He doesnt believe bs spouts. attention money. actually even worse... knows he's making lives miserable maliciously.

Atleast that's think he's doing. genuinely believes says... well he's still dumb fuck.

So former. Evilest fucker ever. latter... Dumbest fucker ever. Nice policy sure, actually getting Walmart employees enforce though different story. Praise Lord, finally. It‚Äôs okay, makes sense. hope you‚Äôre okay! according we‚Äôre reaching point every week many Americans die COVID-19 entire Iraqi War (4,576) Afghanistan War (2,216 far)

Every week. Lol üòÜ numbers still reported state health departments. Yes excellent point. work chain similar Walmart employees allowed ask customers leave--only security certain management ranks, safety liability reasons. Pretty sure policy exists Wal-Mart incidents. Makes sense extent, also shitty someone actively stealing, damaging property brings (mean) dog indiscreetly. infect us they're spreading it, lessen intelligent population. wear mask, we're protecting them. Omg. I'm freaking out. = less us. bit beat record! USA USA...#1!!! Well, bs comment I‚Äôll serious here.
This looks like right thing make. least respect disagree. really want friends maybe patient listen bs respectfully disagree.
If disrespects wife get mf out. South rise covid cases!&lt; again! That‚Äôs assuming read They‚Äôve one worst area comes sanitation practices. It‚Äôs time stepped up. doesn‚Äôt wear mask?  US continues blame china shit ACTUALLY doing.

Gaslight. 
Obstruct. 
Project. Air conditioning: say Ducey terrible ones. end day, true they‚Äôre extremely difficult position theyre fighting top level even worse worst them, actively everything wrong going far sabotage efforts trying something right (defunding shit, hiding data, opposing science, etc.), well huge proportion population brainwashed extremely angry. took long? agree. Dumbasses walking around without masks long. claim absolutely absurd.

The claim **correct** totally obvious understand tiny bit gas diffusion works.

If mask anywhere well fit, it'll absolutely retain CO2.This extra CO2 eventually sip drop normal levels takes seconds. Perhaps 10s seconds.

 breath CO2 back in. think get dangerous levels though.

Also, breath heavily, simply cannot get enough air mask (even surgical mask let alone N-95) fast enough. You‚Äôre welcome, Internet friend! Anyone wanna guess help curb spread proliferation flu year?


Wearing mask!


So simple, yet yup we're totally fucked. work walmart local officer stand front. He‚Äôs Walmart payroll &amp; gets paid ($12/hr clue pay increase decrease overheard asking Christmas shift lol) OK. idea. shit ton unemployed angry people there, waiting things go back normal. Bills pay, mouths feed mask-opposing assholes delaying big time. 

Why don‚Äôt stores create new positions ‚Äúmask enforcers‚Äù? TIL Kroger largest supermarket chain US. 

I handle mask part..  bet already made rounds but

 Lake Charles here. Glad see this. Wish people around sense this. Shits get real. Won‚Äôt even come close per capita. UK stopped testing comparison useless. 

Do think Florida going 20k covid deaths? Agreed, received press. GB behaving like us. Apple didn‚Äôt fall far tree. air conditioners. We're busy playing politics ignoring fact every southern state currently experiencing increase due use air conditioning, reported: needlessly political. Everyone want arizona, texas, florida, despite california, new mexico, etc, also terrible numbers, especially SoCal.

There technologies mitigate this. need simply pay everyone upgrade HVAC system. Instead we're locked endless battle political party wearing masks (which everyone anyway BTW). want believe that...sure üòÇ Tbf, believe EVERY parent child school cares else would situation. count states exceed 1000 new cases see really outliers drive number whole sea rising. used 10 states 1000+ couple days ago, today 17. factor growing faster total number last days

This background spreading scientists warned us weeks ago. might stable number period time cases starting distribute much evenly. hotspots anymore contained local lockdowns. everywhere time.  Lol. It‚Äôs sad satire truth bundled one sentence. believe well. know anyone virus, real them. worse, know someone it, mild case &amp; recovered quickly ill effects. would also cover someone get tested, got sick &amp; claimed covid. I'm sure dozens crap youtube &amp; social media. ""It big deal."" There's even Govenor got &amp; still masks. Tell punt em back across side border stamp foreheads word idiot. Holy moly great, thanks! probably start tying tables together, bet cello would make good paddle. use facebook twitter. baseless assumptions like make? 

Is particular reason taking frustrations me, life -- project issues onto random people Reddit know literally nothing about?

As long we're making assumptions, I'd bet behavior exclusive Reddit. bet go looking arguments social media sites well.  Choice staple receipt thumb web leave nothing. Well lot bar bouncers work... addition Petco, Walmart, Costco many more. Sad private business government won‚Äôt. But, I‚Äôll take progress day. Trump win popular vote. ""people's choice.""

what repeatedly telling do?

he election within system ""the people"" live in.

let cautionary tale incentive change system. Belgium first responded well hard, reported deaths aggressively, nursing homes etc. included reasonably early. Like like probably come better real accounting comes (source: neighbouring country, recalls Belgium press getting little upset fast lot lax) forgot put mask going apartment building got friendly reminder front desk dude. I'm glad actively enforcing it, still sucks *have* use elevator high rise, I'm 4th floor, people wait next one see occupied. feel blessed live Oregon, still heard anyone know personally get covid. Hopefully measures keeping place keep safe here! hobby lobby went Illinois weeks back literally ‚Äúmasks required‚Äù sign door despite half people wearing using chin straps. Politics pandemics mix. likely die car accident. Drive safely. Outside city hall: cases positive taken month without retest.  really known recoveries, estimated. 2020: End MAGA's Karen's. 

Gotta love it! think know teachers make kids sit seats quiet? No, CONSTITUTION lays powers federal state governments, provide power federal government force country wear masks.

Do even understand Constitution is? sound like Trump, thought article II said could whatever wanted. Yea, neither employees...I already know many cast members tested positive. didn‚Äôt get sick Disney (yet) it‚Äôs everywhere community doesn‚Äôt matter. US done absolutely shit job guaranteed worst worlds: terrible virus outcomes terrible effect economy. said, never going able recreate success isolated, island nation far smaller population density far less international travel. type letter O? White House refuses act happens. absolute king  chance everyone followed Wuhan model (I‚Äôm talking welding people homes, full-ass shutdown everything 60ish days, tracing program running, travel outside yr city etc), countries opted either half ass lockdowns outright denial. Sucks lot chance blown spectacularly, good luck possibly running something similar future. cant nice things bc people would rather inconvenienced staying home / wearing masks out. Deathsentence say HIV airborn, wonder people would quick defend right wear masks.

For posterity, posted, ‚Äúthe Venn diagram kind people trump voters perfect circle‚Äù. whole world laughs leader, plague rat. USA folks crossing medical personnel help, frankly, need help here! family bad... Arizona notorious one ignorant states. much ""don't stifle rights"" environment racism heavy element there, too.

Unfortunately, I'm surprised bad is. hope get worse.  Answer this, then. Soldiers take oath protect constitution enemies foreign domestic. Trump violated constitution numerous times, threat democracy. military honored oath straight arrested enable him? soldiers failing oath, us? agree him, is. 

My current belief military agree Trump completely, why. Tell soldiers met fail oath?  would even see numbers? don‚Äôt show Fox News staffers terrified give bad news. lives bubble voters live in. Think animals human living thi kind life living even non pandemic days. animals every day exhausting destroying home greed. praying God keep pandemic live life. people championing fact cases rose without deaths?? 
Anyone? Yo hard breath son One three people test positive Flu asymptomatic (based literally 3 seconds googling, take hefty grain salt). 

The thing dangerous Covid (again, based non-medical googling hearsay) *two week* incubation period (which say spread two weeks show symptoms) whereas Flu two days incubation. 

You Covid spread two weeks show symptoms. JoJo‚Äôs bizarre election 2020! Welp, really care enough find law not. Basically told ID looks real enough scans (which admittedly often scanning part), kind accept hands.


In slightly unrelated note - cash already gross begin with. cannot stress much want handle people's disgusting corona money, especially boob/sock money days. every since 'rona cash use skyrocketed (which probably people losing jobs etc) *coronavirus liked that* work die Yikes sounds like fun. serve booze break ice things right? Like guy Anger Management?

 ""I happy, skipped sad, feel like kicking ass"" Screw trump NY resident, sure glad somebody finally take virus swarm title pissed states learn anything us. Mass distribution Oxford vaccine fall return normalcy holidays.

It's probably likely outcome, definitely attainable. What‚Äôs funny haven‚Äôt seen Kroger 20 years, since shut POS town. Blue light special baby.. Walmart owns crap, still #1 beyond me. Aw, melted heart, mean it. really feels good know appreciated. Likewise.. help get picture edible pear growing Abbott head?! experience thus far rule, employer tried implement measures month half ago. coworker enforced them. within days, barely week, policy fell back masks optional customer. honestly, made mandatory everywhere, there's excuse anybody. Easter masks referring understood effective reducing transmission cloth masks cheap surgical masks. Neither designed protect wearer virus. masks would protect vulnerable person N95 masks. rationing N95 masks frontline healthcare workers, never shortage cloth masks bc could simply make one old towel shirt needed to. Many people Vietnam sew discarded fabric textile factories sell street. believe CDC even ended recommending using bandana mask. presume know CDC late recommending masks. cares would onslaught masks like toilet paper? never national shortage toilet paper. stores ran reordered toilet paper. Maybe CDC worried would recommend cloth/surgical masks everyone would go buy N95? I'm pretty sure point even able find N95 store tried. presume know CDC late recommending masks. time figured reasons cited, reversed course thought realized made mistake. hindsight appears huge mistake. inconsistent messaging caused lot confusion. find disingenuous CDC saying reversed course based science. understood virus transmitted airborne droplets presymptomatic people could spread virus, CDC recommending wear mask. I'm sure new information changed mind. then? inconvenience? need America Karens think comment logically follows.

I aware kind ignorance even posted. aware ignorance posted. unaware something learn.

Also think share definition podunk given issue extends urban areas like Chicago. We've got one Texas rumored ~20000 fans attendance (though say exactly many) Well I‚Äôm guessing giving death answer. üôÑ US? CDC pivot ""masks work"" ""nevermind, everyone wear mask"" sometime April. Thankfully, ignored garbage advice masks US public health authorities, masking February March, people trusted CDC probably wearing masks three months. Yes no, understanding teachers lose pension jobs striking. . would love say I'd it, would also suck lose future worked teacher many years. Also bigger union, harder unify. I'm 700plus person union feels like shit show sometimes. may solve national problem. Get ready resistance.... Get ready resistance....  I‚Äôve updating guys since hospital right edge, today ran ICU beds completely. 


We -3 ICU beds (meaning three patients line) Hey, forget ri!  Good point. I'm sorry. Churches, classrooms, bars, family gatherings....

All death traps. think R-led state legislature might looking pass laws take away Wolf's power here.

I've talking people Pennsylvania happy putting restrictions place. One person said bluntly ""I would lawsuit Gov. Wolf!""  school time, open 'em up!  long government giving covering food housing costs such. cant ways. Lemme guess gonna come back say shouldnt support gonna create catch 22 scenario. also still learning long term effects virus. Regardless age. put travel ban Florida? Nobody out? Thank finally! Masks aren‚Äôt effective protecting wearer. workers especially exposed.  also say let gay kids stay house overnight partner. See people issue leaders say?

#DicksOutForCovid sending special ed kids school, actively advocating way put unnecessary danger. That's 10x unfair since really deserve that. Touche. anti mask morons dead set right thing mean nothing them. time ever consider working there

""Hey fuck wad put mask on!"" Oh yeah transmit sure. (At low rate) implied ‚Äúbasic common sense‚Äù would vectors posited would different disease. provided answers that.

Not sure that‚Äôs part picked entire thing haha.. Well Texas, Arizona, Florida May find dicks Fauci too? take week implement rule. Let martyr themselves. give fuck anymore. Exactly. Happy Cake Day! üéÇ hope doesn‚Äôt encourage theft... god. That‚Äôs size small city. mother nature‚Äôs way saying ‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT FUCK ME‚Äù Unless buying selling people free send trade goods back forth keep infected tourists nation. bought barber kit clippers 50 dollars back March I‚Äôve probably saved family 400 dollars since. I‚Äôve gotten pretty good cutting hair actually. may go back barbershop wedding day. isn‚Äôt nearly enough publicly available information ChAdOx-1 making statements. Born, taxed, fucked. Huh? Lol Fair enough. That's much better comparison. Really? live Washington (not King county) think we‚Äôre great job. Certainly hell lot better states like Texas, Florida, Arizona, Georgia. Fuck yeah, Austin. Good everyone made possible. Oh right... Black Death airborne. bitten fleas carrier rats. That's half Florida's number, math right. Comparing Arizona look even favorable DUDE! Wtf gotta it....im NOWHERE overweight....im SHEEPLE!  Question, death rates USA half two months ago, number infected almost three times today may. Eli5 fewer people dying yet way infected. (because someone threw ""wisdom"" me, can't come rebuttle. know deaths NY. Exactly, torrid shit makes one shining beacon. ü§Ø Better late never, fuck wait till now? anyone need Walmart?

This comment reveals profound unawareness ubiquitous Walmart primary store many paces across Took words right outta mouth! states guilty this. Including California. According this, claim 20 million cases happened early months 2 million actually detected. That's bit good news here, since herd immunity slightly lower death rate. Wrong. point northern Europe scientifically literate wear masks. statement applies essentially northern Europe. trust fuck?  stimulus package paid American people stay home, including workers. pay system get nothing it. 6 months late. Better late never guess. news. commentary. guy also recovering alcoholic himself. Rt? Let idiot games begin!!‚Äôn Ok. think maybe classify I‚Äôm talking ‚Äúnight club‚Äù then? Time machine, aisle 4... could go back July 22 2019 would make fucking difference! Already practicing. months live. Florida 65,000 square miles LA County 4,500 square miles. Florida condensed twice size LA (given twice population) kept policies place we‚Äôd another NYC circa March/April hands.

I‚Äôd fine giving people choice penalty wearing mask public severe penalty drunk driving. lot less selfish morons would making choice endanger everyone around prolong economic pain communities. That‚Äôs penalties place drunk drivers, idiots less likely endanger innocent people lazy inconsiderate plan ahead.  Whether zero relevance inmate prison did. driving habits. poor choices made. grasp alone responsible...they never ""free"" instead perpetual victim consequences choices. Exactly! mention employees took leave absence (after repeatedly told two weeks paid) ended getting letters threatening send collections give money back. work clean room wear 2 layers masks. 

Try drinking water. found increasing aqua intake helped massively energy levels work extra mask. 

Even better cold water, thankfully fab. Na, suburban Texas town sick tired dumbasses listening fuckin hero. Thank you.  waiting Jul 22 bring flak jacket policy. Spoken like true fucking idiot.  point remains stores obligated let people spread virus workers customers. way people refused listen comply simplest measures now. Around young people, tourists, republicans. Can‚Äôt wait see recorded public freak outs. *prepares bag popcorn* park ranger told personally. Meyer's Ralph's also owned Kroger, likely see west. Still bad enough shut down, guess. Wonder it‚Äôll take happen. Astra Zeneca testifies front Congess next week. stage 3 trials Brazil couple weeks now. might early results since virus raging hard Brazil, 10 percent control group got infected already none vaccinated people have. Well...I'm going guess going giant push go ahead release vaccine (Oxford). going 1000 people dead day here, vaccine likely save thousands lives released early. Nah everyone GETS IT. think calling bar actually called nightclub? people fragile stay home.  trying force way stores wanted. I‚Äôve heard states - CDC - conflating numbers. Like testing places never providing negative results such. truth that? So, basically they're okay they're spreading virus make money. Yep, sounds American. Welcome America healthcare business. Keep supporting Republican policies Arizona, stay classy! ""One day like miracle disappear"" one try - referring black protests anti-lockdown protests started April? think latter important breakdown terms disaster psychology. inject  likely distributed healthcare social care workers October general public get sometime beginning 2021 lot safety tests vaccine well.  trying spread misinformation? except karen ken daily video upload direct video link trouble playing

* Oof...that actually gives context people believe healthcare worse must think healthcare system like. would be...pretty bad, yeah. drive Walmart, open camping chair, wait see

If Walmart since April know recording plays says loitering store lot prohibited. started sooner because...? feel like going one ‚Äúgreatest unsolved mysteries‚Äù types things. can‚Äôt see anyone solving within lifetime. Catalan COVID mixer! someone downvotes trying downplay virus, I‚Äôm not- would like make sure valid source.

Is Worldometer accurate? us 70,000 days ago wasn‚Äôt confirmed JHU‚Äôs COVID tracker reported news outlets. I‚Äôve also noticed death counts NY pretty different ones reported state (Worldometer says 33 today whereas NY says 9, fairly big difference)

And course simple question discrepancy data getting downvoted. sub predictable sometimes. I‚Äôm rural Pennsylvania lot assholes won‚Äôt wear masks. Luckily, due rural, social distancing kinda default helps control spread. know it, focus work increasing stupid. Come on, everyone! treatment getting better people arent dying often Could first 1000 plus day since June 9th. 



What happened... Damn sucks man I‚Äôm sorry hear that.  words.... *In month we're going see start morbid depressing truth one deny* actually make money fewer people getting sick. suspension procedures increase people avoiding healthcare facilities means bloated profits.

What's encouraging pay back insured per Obamacare. take certain profit percentage. Look Trump reddit find Trump morons congregating discussing wear mask like forced wear burka. OP pushing white supremacist rhetoric say black activists less intelligent, sub alt-right truly calling bluff shit. Americans crazy armed. can't think accept families thrown onto street able pay rent. hell federal government even for?   That's said administration. Trump sets terrible example, Americans general like 5 year olds told responsible.  Can't wait flooding Houston whenever rains little much. Godwin's Law strikes again! At..most king Sooper‚Äôs(kroger) I‚Äôve CO, I‚Äôd say 85-90% wearing them. least experience. Speaking Denver metropolitan area.  husband tested symptoms Monday results. gotten worse work tomorrow Cool story. local king soopers also ‚Äúrequires every one wear mask‚Äù yet still fuckos wandering around wearing em, baggers collecting carts without em. Crazy pa many deaths Florida, Texas Arizona , absolute numbers per capita legal? Anyone Trump/Barr think another genius idea smart/stable genius? also want pander religious base fit narrative righteous side politics. could care less try uphold identity. Naw tried that. Multiple times tried that, time play nice. mass death event, much value hearing people ideas around cognative load problem convincing people withholding evidence might happening. Florida surpass NY 10 days so. began golden age /r/publicfreakout Still dont see links evidence. responding right comment? Lol Shhh, we're supposed ask question. Waaaaay late thing can‚Äôt attribute deaths people wearing mask way someone dies due drunk driving. 

I however choosing exit conversation good someone calls imprisonment wearing mask someone want talk to. lot expensive elective procedures cancelled, health insurance companies much lower costs revenue (since nobody gonna cancel health insurance pandemic) I've cutting hair 4 months. actually hard. Good god. Florida already 300k, that's even whole UK one worst responses pandemic ourselves. ""Oh fuck, ran publicity stunt actually voted me. keep saying worst shit possible keep getting popular! There's one way fix this."" Governor needs announce statewide mask mandate. I'm surprised comparison made I've seen say wear mask like muslims forcing women wear burkas. really would bring muslims wouldnt they... fairly major shift policy.  takes time things get everyone page. bet great researcher. work inside Walmart, Walmart (think nail salons instead it‚Äôs kid store), makes HAPPY Walmart mandating masks! lovely corporate decided didn‚Äôt want mandate masks, told us we‚Äôd fired even implied customers wear mask. Now, (hopefully) don‚Äôt deal it! 
Walmart really gods work Ohh airborne disease transmits breath, ha well prove correct more. Thanks! I'm going put telephone poles 10 feet apart yard stop mosquitoes. 

What diseases pass talking? say, sounds like Frisco Allen. Even Biden wins, wait January crap end. administration make Florida‚Äôs data fuckery seem quaint comparison wear face masks public, indulge excessive amounts food, tobacco and/or alcohol, distraction personal failures take responsibilities shortcomings.

what hell Customers required work, noses, noses everywhere. chin they're drinking coffee. freaking pull talk me. Ahhhhhh shit!!! Somebody get popcorn fire YouTube Monday comes going summer blockbuster movie we've waiting Really shouldn‚Äôt bother enforce banning person getting physical. Post signs, greeter remind people. simply refuse payment checkout. Real quick people won‚Äôt bother shop. think partially true best.

The people wonder leadership aren‚Äôt even Trump people normally reasonable, well educated, pro science people know can‚Äôt bothered fully distance. It‚Äôs baffling know well write anti science kooks right wing media zealots. can‚Äôt seem resist peer pressure stuff, seem assume stuff allowed must ok?? Idk really don‚Äôt get people.

Even Trump base though ... think you‚Äôre wrong purely riding wave. Like yes, capitalized stuff already there, also see massive influence public opinion polling stuff. Plus we‚Äôd proper public education response maybe conversations would different. stuff really make world difference multiple causes this. deaths lagging indicator going take couple weeks least showing infected die two seeing younger population largest group infected right 20 30 pretty much lowest death rate however definitely chance long-term damaged said young people infected passing older members society likely cause huge spike deaths weeks six-plus weeks takes time spread incubated get diagnosed die. Also mentioned treatment become better time since using voice text LG edit get home something issue I'm sure someone go detail deaths low necessarily good statistic rely lagging chances infection reported today we're actually tested sometime last week deaths due current outbreak likely show another weeks least.
ELI5 version : treatment current infection demographics lagging reporting time deal drunk frat douches New Years, handle Kroger Karens. would work part time mask enforcer Good luck üëç

I going say best thing management could stand employees' safety empower front line 86 customers politely firmly,. security backup. Buh bye. Last time lady running self check-outs even wearing one. Time different woman wearing nose pulled talking someone. true. bandana support clinical studies, wearing might actually cause get coronavirus even touching near face wearing masks. get surgical mask. 

However, surgical mask prevent catching virus, near someone coronavirus mask, coughing near 6 feet know black people homosexuals things disproportionately? must RACIST bigoted, HOMOPHOBE. Don‚Äôt worry CDC can‚Äôt report numbers never hit 140k

/s Oh irony, crowd probably half mormon. would consider smoking coffee drinking something harmful body want protect children even seeing others it. They're also extremely anti-abortion (and anti-LGBTQ) mask says ""my body choice"" truly tacky offensive. Woooooohooooooo!!!!!
USA USA USA üá∫üá∏ dead 111
my kids full time school
some new outbreaks lots infection tracing. Largest ? first time heard really hope **isn‚Äôt** fucking. could mean like him. It' pathetic something easy difficult super small amount people... Yikes, can‚Äôt fix stupid. Unfortunately, he‚Äôs putting Oklahomans lives risk mask mandate taking proper precautions himself. administration wishes true... July 22

This dumbest fucking country face goddamn planet. February. WDRB? Please find something reputable. Glad read whole comment haha almost downvoted first sentence  I‚Äôll help Kroger workers punch people. No. Alcoholics like sitting home getting drunk collecting six hundred bonus bux. Kroger willingly letting virus spread ONE FULL WEEK making masks mandatory? Why? put masks already people stupid become? Sheesh haven‚Äôt seen myself. I‚Äôve seen people taking seriously social distancing. actual fucking idiot. business employees people. US got numbers right now, [India's curve daily new looks legit scary.

It slowly picking steam throughout lockdown look like going stop anytime soon, likely limited testing well. combination conditions quite dire, ~12x population density US all. Don‚Äôt blame rurals know can‚Äôt justify kids going back school shutdown. kids can‚Äôt go school parents cant go office. Guaranteed fatalities incoming. There's going open carrying, non-mask wearing asshole leave end getting shot shooting someone. even think flood videos come. There'll crazy content. convenient excuse close polling stations make voting lines longer wherever Democratic voters. \*A lot people. 


FTFY, count passed 140,000 people now. :( country literal hell world. literally Nero fiddling Rome burns.

We‚Äôve reached end stage nation. ruling party power literal death cult point. Every state nation contains Florida tourists. Florida, ground zero COVID, summer edition. Fucking why? feel like matter time anti maskers come fully armed shop, daring people stop them. worry guyzzz mostly outside know protests people protected outside even large crowds accept it.  Pretty upset local HEB. told tell customers seen without mask anything, leave alone. said attacks retail employees one guy getting killed. someone shop Walmart frequently due poor af tell issue many people wear mask front door start taking store. ABSOLUTELY ONE keeping respectable social distance. Take money hire cashiers, open 1/3 lanes. hire actual security personnel floor engage unmasked individuals escort refuse comply. live FL, one WORST states Covid right now. Business need serious regardless local/state government requiring.  Wrong. debunk. Idiot  Pretty embarrassing big chains calling minimum wage workers ""essential workers"" order keep forcing work rest us permitted shelter, months later 130,000 fucking people died COVID (in US) **only now** decided enforce mask policy. understand DeSantis continues put emphasis testing. Testing measures problem. Testing helpful contact tracing, reduce problem small enough size. then, measures.

Prevention key. several ways prevent infection. Masks work, surprisingly well. Social distancing works, sometimes, people sober.  Shut downs work, expensive.  one tool works well, inexpensive, ""MASKS"".  DeSantis continue refuse issue statewide mask order?

Testing measures.  Masks actually address problem. Grew Miami. Left Florida 1984 never looked back. give Time Man Year.

As Canadian watch Titanic USA continue hit iceberg daily, don‚Äôt want him, gladly take him. fucking vote out. hold personally responsible vote. Nebraska report cases, really 0? outdone Walmart! guy fucking bumpkin idiot. 

Also, republicans reject continue unemployment money refuse accept reality, going mass organized looting. Far worse before. Watch. 

People steal much shit survive. They‚Äôll broke nothing lose ‚Äújobs go back to‚Äù states actively surging. dragged long end sight think lot people given up. advise people social distance stay home long. 

The time proactively beat pandemic April unified ‚Äúall together‚Äù message. national motto ‚Äúwe eventually going get bother‚Äù. Good luck enforcing employees dont even wear masks. You‚Äôre acting like you‚Äôre complete dumb fuck think show much lower threshold action is, outside US. part ongoing lament people government leads us slaughter. That's latest dumb shit though. actual cause started WAY elected buffoon. Statistician here, absolutely agree. 

Anywhere there‚Äôs possibility artificial data manipulation huge red flags. It‚Äôs big issue - now, line years science turns managing looking back evaluating. 

The states data collection, there's still ability sanity checks comparing multiple sources may may accurate. also don‚Äôt know much I‚Äôd trust certain states thrilled thought manipulating data (such states already done it) Honest question, wait? older get big hits football knockout punches boxing disgust me.

I think rule changes big help. xfl removed kickofffs source biggest hits replaced something fun. 70,000 cases today country, Florida, Texas, Cali posting 10k least 100 deaths well. Things fucked. Walmart deploying specially trained employees literally wearing black shirts ‚Äúencourage‚Äù Karens wear masks. people though. friend fly soon they'll overstay student visa deported. they're going home grandmother mother oxygen lungs. Imagine much better everything would Trump make political r/Masks4All nationwide March/April like almost every country Earth Imagine much better everything would Trump make political r/Masks4All nationwide March/April like almost every country Earth I'm sorry, absurd.  focusing single potential corollary. massive opening Israel time schools opening. available data specific children school transmission. Israeli talking recommends slowly re-opening leaving time evaluate. NBC making title discussing correspondents reason, political. Every single person turning political issue needs stop, polarizing people further. 

If want promote science public health objective neutral. video reinforce peoples concern piss polarized side wants say myth. Yeah people money, can't buy shit. never got middle June, earliest. think one year use snow days something like June 16th thrilled.

I live NYC kids don‚Äôt go back week Labor Day don‚Äôt end last week June. It‚Äôs awful schedule. bad I'm sure real not?

But seriously... real? # *NOT POLITE* designation, it‚Äôs literally matter equipment staff. Regular rooms don‚Äôt set ICU rooms. don‚Äôt continuous monitoring set run vents.

That said, angers people like gentleman minds poisoned people OK using weapons. He's victim, long term effort help everyone avoid ignorant malicious intentions. Lies bigotry -- othering people -- easy. I'm glad good people number bad, we'd perpetually screwed.  Well, beds really useful get proper care. People might well die beds hospitals can't staff properly. Yes, DeSantis largely blame. Assuming fact infection, eyeballing graph would say odds false negative 40%. get tested day 3 develop symptoms, better accuracy, risk false negative falls 20%. research link: posted timeline times already I'll link it: one symptoms loss smell taste, likelihood actually Covid rise dramatically, symptom relatively uncommon respiratory illnesses. complete near complete loss smell taste, chances 10:1 Covid. Take care wish speedy recovery whatever is.) TLDR: 1 new imported cases, 0 new domestic cases, 1 new imported asymptomatic carrier, 1 new domestic asymptomatic carrier

Translation:

From National Health Commission China, yesterday 15/07/2020 00:00 - 24:00 , 31 provinces (including autonomous regions direct-administered municipalities) Xinjiang Production Construction Corps report 1 new confirmed case COVID-19, imported case (Shanghai). new deaths, new suspected cases.

For yesterday, 26 COVID-19 patients recovered, 264 close contacts longer medical observation, number cases serious critical condition change.

Currently 84 imported cases (2 serious condition), 2 imported suspected case. Accumulative imported cases 1,989, accumulative recovered imported cases 1905, accumulative deaths imported cases 0.

Up 15/07/2020 24:00, 31 provinces (including autonomous regions direct-administered municipalities) Xinjiang Production Construction Corps report current remaining cases 259 (3 serious critical condition). Accumulative recovery 78,719, accumulative deaths 4,634, accumulative confirmed cases 83,612, current suspected cases 3. Accumulative close contact confirmed cases identified via contract tracing 767,532, 3,313 currently remain medical observation.

31 provinces (including autonomous regions direct-administered municipalities) Xinjiang Production Construction Corps report 2 new asymptomatic carriers (1 imported). new asymptomatic carrier became confirmed case yesterday, 8 released isolation recovered (7 imported). Currently 104 asymptomatic carriers medical isolation (81 imported).

Accumulative confirmed cases Hong Kong SAR, Macau SAR Taiwan region 2085. Hong Kong SAR 1,588 (1,241 recovery, 10 death), Macau SAR 46 (45 recovery), Taiwan region 451 (440 recovery, 7 death). ever wonder bubonic plague hit. anyone said Muslim hoax Ok research keep finding one study Feb 2018. still think mask 50% pointless wearing perfection. one does.

Highlights below:

In all, team able use viable data 218 samples exhaled breath 218 ‚Äúnasopharyngeal swabs,‚Äù samples taken nose back nose throat. samples exhaled breath included samples taken natural breathing, spontaneous coughs, sneezes.

To collect exhaled breath samples, researchers invited participants breathe normally cone-shaped aerosol sampler 30 minutes recited alphabet 5, 15, 25 minutes. collected two types aerosol samples: coarse fine.

Of 23 fine aerosol samples collected normal breathing without coughing, analysis showed 11 samples ‚Äî nearly half ‚Äî contained detectable traces viral RNA, including eight infectious virus. suggests normal breathing considerable contributor aerosol shedding flu virus exhaled breath

You might think one way breathe people's flu viruses protect wearing mask, that's Milton found. ""We found previous study people wear surgical mask half hour take wear half hour, collected two separate samples, surgical masks good getting rid large droplets. fine particles, cut half.""

The way truly protect influenza-infected individuals stay away them, especially poorly ventilated areas. Milton says liberal sick leave policies workplace go long way keep people workplace healthy.


And found one study... Soooo ya... Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* two cops line behind local kroger didnt masks on. God bless america. corporations fight coronavirus federal government Imagine coughed sneezed doorstep left package went picked 30 seconds later. courtesy though ""I give least little shit."" UberEats driver wearing mask properly getting confused leave food got annoyed go outside like ""Yeah right house"" given he's supposed wearing it. seventy-second video, try working eight twelve hours see comfortable is.  That's bad, that's like one office USA. call proactive, basically everyone planet months... Haha yeah I've always strong sense smell revert never change behavior going (re)infect people. agree huge political motive approve *any vaccine* we‚Äôve already seen motive action went surrounding Hydroxychloroquine think vastly underestimate long takes collect, clean, process phase III data. Remember Moderna vaccine top line results announced months ago saw responses 8/45 patients? Look long took data get published sample size that‚Äôs orders magnitude smaller what‚Äôs used phase III used serum samples didn‚Äôt require additional follow up. like said previous comment, phase III tendency reveal unpleasant realities weren‚Äôt apparent smaller trials‚Äî vast majority drugs don‚Äôt pass phase testing. without sin among you, let first cast stone.

Not good criminal defense strategy...the guy said got nailed cross. Well, that‚Äôs fitting freaky picture. Yeap. Governor oklahoma announced got corona today. Still wont implement masks. Tulsa law tulsa county wear local attorneys sueing shit city thousands protesting wear Marion Certified worker. Theres sign door sating masks required. boss told explicitly stop anyone wearing mask. week up, 2 people worn masks gas station.... 25% customers said made comments me, employee wearing mask. feel like time job coming quick end. guy Walmart flashing gun asked put mask? 90% symptoms within 14 days. Yeah, gotta get either Governor Florida Administration to.... Oh whoops they're problem.


I guess no? I'm sure. right lots people care, also plenty people would never dreamed supporting revolution balkanization saying, maybe would better state linked states. 

Like, Bunker Baby minions come steal medical supplies states paid top dollar for, one governors medical supplies defended armed guards...if fight broke situation, people would back governor, without question. red caps would back president. alone could started civil war. 

I agree things could get worse (they always get worse) also set motion chain events seen worst yet. Nah, he‚Äôs trying get heaven filling souls. fabled ‚ÄúLet God Sort Out‚Äù strategy. That's posts use cryptic words replace real ones, like Cov|d, V@ccines, Bill Gate$, etc... powerful beings behind global conspiracy can't use search terms reason. Fauci getting credit / recognition history books, send message best get pandemic . true selfless man. Thanks, least know expect now. realize still grocery stores requiring masks locations. Holy shit. irony base absorbed much scandal atrocities anything tapes would erode single member base. Dude, supposed talk stuff. getting soros checks? called hush money reason! This.  Is.  Fucked. chain stores security door, like LCBO Frills stuff, seem like aisle walkers explain charter rights freedoms works Karens, clear right front one right snowflake infringes rights others. again, ratio Karens rational people seems like 1:500. 

I understand big deal is, though. treat like post-apocalyptic cosplay, even feel necessary anyway dick sort amusing mask entering store, like I'm embarking arduous quest. really, whatever takes get back normal worth it. three ice cream sizes: like it, love it, got it.

*That* failing. Good thing they‚Äôre giving people without masks full 6 days get ready nightmarish future awaits them. UGH, fingers crossed &amp; hopefully Dad changes mind. chart line worst risk covid somewhere...see find it, show him. know hard. Half family like us careful &amp; half think hoax blown...crazy times. safe!! already sense new Karen videos. delays good labs located population centers horribly overwhelmed backlogged. mean shabby labs smaller cities rural areas get flooded too. 

Which interests Trump's cease testing anyone make appear virus Trump promised would going away, clearly isn't. numbers going down, like said, didn‚Äôt say this? numbers go down? go! numbers look good, opinion! they‚Äôll continue go America great! making America great again!   Who's wearing mask supermarket??? fuck assholes forget memaw Ivey... statewide mask mandate ""not going enforce it"" üôÑ like 2 public addresses past 3 months. MIA cases climb. Im sure next TX, def anywhere near enough hospital capacity. understand crazy people bad people get guns illegally right? disarming law abiding citizens. Children Men favorite dystopian sci fi novel really one wanted live Noticed article image red-vest person surgical mask [vent . . pretty much exhale-valve mask. would he? He‚Äôs done anything wrong. stores original capacity. 

These fractional capacity solutions never impressed anyone. worked Fred Meyer five years, probably count one hand number days store actually came close maximum occupancy. probably go 50% twice per year (college nights, maybe Christmas Eve Thanksgiving, Black Fridays actually jammed). all. sympathy, friend. Every day watch videos people trying litigate/sneak/fight way store without mask on. None deserve this.

Know appreciated.  even so, spreads droplets (much less mask on), sure would infecting people come contact him...but less viral load. perhaps even bodies would able avoid infection immune system would able handle right away eliminate it. Reducing viral load thing time infection stops needing vent two weeks later I‚Äôve reading. I'm Utah. getting worse seems state government sitting ass ""hoping folks kind neighbors wear mask"".

We huge amount dumbasses state. LDS Church even said wear mask, folks still whining ""my freedom"". Idk take sh!t seriously hed know somebody super rich So?!? Yes take away ability defend law abiding citizens fear crazies. Free market solution Please put tit mouth. can't come store unless tit mouth. That‚Äôs new government incentive get people back work. really kicked first round hit New York neighbouring states used judge bad counting number states thousand new cases day. Bit mad metric, gave feel. hit 10 states, bad book.

I kept up, habit, sort new cases count them.

Yesterday, 17. narrative US among rest world going hell handbasket tiresome incites fear. 

Fuck noise, even know contribute bullshit anymore. 

Things better. Sure, going get worse, but, we‚Äôre going prevail. vaccine 100 percent effective least certain amount months high risk people still want cautious. pretty sure could milk virus good chunk time. Absolutely.  said six months that‚Äôs far covid-19 are! two Individuals agree it‚Äôs good plan quoted article Michael Caputo Robert Redfield, Trump appointees. also quotes past CDC employee expert George Mason University express concerns plan. 

People rightly suspicious Trump‚Äôs administration‚Äôs motives here. Trump expressed interest reducing testing make numbers better. Handing responsibility private company got no-bid contract sketchy hell. 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20500 Russians trying hack steal? wai!!! 

- heard spiffy new vaccine, would need steal others? Wake America, Russia enemy. Breaking news: Trump says USA trying steal Russia‚Äôs vaccine data. pretty much everyone politics. SAVE_US.Y2J attacking basically killing unfortunate compromised. natural level, this, wont anyone else really infect kill, everyone remaining asymptomatic immune....like NY. want us take seriously, start counting Covid Deaths ""deaths Covid"" instead ""deaths Covid deaths Covid""?

Why infected case counts including ""probable"" cases well confirmed cases?

Why reported testing facilities Florida test results 100% confirmed? impact Infection Rate results?

The CDC reported may face masks significant effect transmission flu (which believe would directly translate corona medical masks (also known surgical masks) loose-fitting devices designed worn medical personnel protect accidental contamination patient wounds, protect wearer splashes sprays bodily fluids limited evidence effectiveness preventing influenza virus transmission either worn infected person source control worn uninfected persons reduce exposure. systematic review found significant effect face masks transmission laboratory-confirmed influenza.  

If answer questions without dodging them, I'll take say seriously would love discussion you.  humble, need show record low numbers. lock inside forever. people spreading anyways.

Plus happiest place earth. good bug dead bug. mean xenophobic attack intelligence Americans, think US nation psychologically equipped deal pandemic. 

The way get control without vaccine sacrifice self greater good. America, rampantly individualistic nation earth, national DNA. 

Nothing wrong per se, encounter situation like this. do, think, deal deaths. Deal trauma wait vaccine. legitimate response centred self sacrifice ever option, would place now.

That said, know Americans taking route. enough actually can't float around ""on own"", MUST carried liquid. ""on own"", virus immediately dies. Texas governor back April.... you‚Äôd think Kemp would seen poorly went. keep mask hand put unable practice social distancing. Michael Mina joins TWiV reveal frequent rapid SARS-CoV-2 testing important accuracy, daily $1 rapid test could control pandemic, group testing works. Report daily aggregated covid results? Pretty sure that's new thing labs. Plus, got mandated report new system HHS instead CDC, could bug new system user input error familiar new system. I'm sure they'll get straightened out.

Regardless, small % incorrectly reported results really change anything. reason, yes. first symptoms confusing....fever, diarrhea, sweating, swollen lymph glands, persistent pneumonia. one knew virus while, fact sure cancer. common thing lead patients persistent pneumonia immunocompromised patients. early days tended gay males. took time discovery viral. even assumption like flu spread. Tomorrow going shitshow. Oh that's even bad. risk flu shots every year I'm wreck physically lil ache pain hard know comes lol Magic aint thing air Disney world TIL one VA travels part state outside state. Got it. Joking discussion VA subreddit already. Disease problem without borders. increase one part state concern parts state. responded facts without knowing context. saw chicken egg next other, idea things related someone taught you. Phase 2 supposed small sample size see even works, Phase 3 larger sample size see works safe use among larger portion population. 

You skeptical want, drug trails go. special treatment Covid-19 vaccine getting producing large amounts vaccine ahead time they've prepaid for. rules pretty much Spain, back normal suggest. maybe sources.

Two main new outbreaks fruit picking camps, mostly immigrant temporal workers live pretty dire conditions, making difficult social distancing. donations. like people paying him. entitled someone else's donations. 

I would understand someone paying game something along lines.

She literally believes entitled someones donations. terrible person. Give kid money tolerate monster! Can‚Äôt election things get bad.  totally article tried posting says duplicate. point posted please? Seems kind important. Serbians Australia still think Serbia best thing since sliced bread. Every single one supporters? Seems like broad claim. gonna say, might want add hyphen. everyone area know it‚Äôs Put-in Bay lol. might confused naming cities Russian leaders. coworker home sick persistent cough headache. boss requiring get sort testing comes back work tomorrow. worried be? expect see numbers suddenly start drop due funneled away CDC? #freedomfrompants! get many mass murders government positions one time? like waiting kind thing come along could see many people muder still get away it... Cozy Bear again.. course has, people going go prison. Hopefully starting criminal Oval Office. he‚Äôs taken control count hate see what‚Äôs going happen. I‚Äôm American abroad hurts watch happen. mean, basically going make whatever choose believe, least make coherent. text says people move back forth along mood spectrum based nature event. Pandemics unique disasters duration varied effects - don‚Äôt get sick you‚Äôre still affected, instance. like terrorist attack technological disaster say flood. would also suspect mood average South Korean different average American Italian.

For seems function inventory available resources recovery. disillusionment phase seems function this. somebody else committed crime, absolutely evidence support start, generally dismissed.

That's negative enlightened people drafted founding principles believed shaping world focus positive aspects existence deferring idealized truth reasonable assured negative.

Presupposing idea invalid focus really treat legitimate?

- true say Sweden ""nothing much"". formal lockdown, they're still encouraging people socially distance [stuff like setting huge chicken shit stop people gathering groups.

- Partly above, Sweden's economy projected noticeably better comparable European countries.

- Sweden's death rate horrific compared Nordic countries. similar trajectory Norway shut - they've far roughly 10 times many deaths per million Norway

I'm saying things absolute disaster Sweden, things could even worse. let's pretend nothing mitigate Covid-19, let's pretend came unscathed. Right lol  fuck?! miss access Costco.

never missed harder covid, tho. Six months it? *Sixty years HIV,* one realized fatal disease.

The early history HIV fascinating. possibly crossed human population early 1910, WWI. emerged Congo, basically went unnoticed. earliest confirmed case record 1959. wasn‚Äôt 1981 CDC began investigating GRID (‚Äúgay related immune deficiency‚Äù) wasn‚Äôt 1982 CDC belatedly realized could affect anyone renamed AIDS. actual HIV virus first isolated French scientist Fran√ßoise Barr√©-Sinoussi 1983. 

HIV likely circulating US since least late 1960s, took fairly small close community seeing lot people knew die something weird short period time finally become apparent something up. ignored years due homophobia. There‚Äôs also evidence circulating among addicts US cities 70s, possibly even ignored gay population. Funny implore public listen get infected.....

I dont know before, doesnt look like anybody listened.....shit mean that? would understand point deaths still growing exponentially, New York Sweden seem done. smoking month help ? said yesterday another post. Time let burn. Protect family. want burn months, let burn. I'm tired trying change minds. I'll wear mask, stay away groups, curbside food, E-commerce everything else. company told work home long want. hat go deal morons. Stay strong safe. right many Sweden trying paint success story - many bit humble bit less arrogant.

Other that, herd mentally display people's obsession keeping ""sverigebilden"" (image Sweden) intact - COST - provokes me.  No! numbers fine! nothing see here. you‚Äôre saying Canada needs cut middle man start offing old folks article state though: ""Scientists signed letter, including director University Oxford‚Äôs Covid-19 vaccine program"" Damn, always wanted go Kalahari too. Another business ‚ÄúNope!‚Äù List. still get is, mask political issue? wearing mask infringement anyone's freedom? I'm still free move around, still free believe worship, still free think say anything (not without consequences) etc. Basically, FREEDOM US founded upon still without mask. year say trying judge risk, remember basic 

**Indoor** riskier **outdoors.**

**Close distance** riskier **far distance.**

**Prolonged contact** riskier **brief contact.**

**No-mask** riskier **mask.**

**Talking** riskier **silence.**

Those factors work independently, use compensate other. example, must face face conversation hot sit outside, wear mask distance. masks super protective (surgical mask 90% protective, fabric ones 70%) plan long conversation, use additional distancing, i.e. 10 feet instead 6 feet. Activities check risk factors - indoors, prolonged, close-up, one else masked, lots talking - avoided even wear mask.

Daily cases low outdoor activities. [The (which simply slow increment cases seen since outbreak began) started before, government City Buenos Aires began DetectAR program go look infection cases favellas reported hospitals. 

That's see ""the first spike"" around May 15th, first confirmed results came DetectAR program Buenos Aires Quilmes favelas, [which started first week fact DetectAR program picked steam around time outdoor activities allowed City Buenos Aires people complaining use direct blame it. However, one checks number cases neighborhood one note [most cases remain favela-ridden neighborhoods](http://www.el1digital.com.ar/articulo/view/91934/barrio-por-barrio-la-situacion-del-coronavirus-en-la-ciudad-de-buenos-aires). Hardly places people go runs.

Also notice City Buenos Aires seen increase cases, main culprit Province Buenos Aires, never allowed outdoor activities Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area.

Again, blaming outdoor activities spike cases scientific evidence points low risk contagion poor, unscientific excuse. Talking ""agendas"" instead providing evidence another sad excuse. put 150k people there.

I‚Äôm wondering fact these, slightly obese‚Äù individuals worse outcomes due unexpectedly higher co-morbid factors. Americans doing, guys? daily life right now? see massive numbers hard imagine. live north Netherlands, barely cases... Life changed whole lot Stores still can. It‚Äôs bible. Imagine Walmart concerned government... case growth rate three weeks ago? approximate death growth rate today friend‚Äôs argument made sense March/April surface transmission big deal thought, make good effort touch face, etc makes sad died government doesn‚Äôt appreciate her. It‚Äôs like medical workers lambs slaughter. It‚Äôs heart breaking. Yes translation mentions type masks meet standards. translation fine is. I'm suprised rule till now.  saw Finnish news article yesterday mask usage lowest Finland Sweden. currently enforced way Helsinki public transport percent wear masks. Everything back almost normal, know long last people started travel nightclubs open etc. idiots disney 80% children die flu year unvaccinated (% adults likely higher) 15-60k die annually. free, everywhere mandatory public education. Well, one article wrong translation got deleted pointed mistake, making ""one type mask"" ""any type"" seems misleading. 
Unfortunately Google Translate relatively bad sometimes. Deborah Birx also similarly restrained.

No, Birx fucking piece shit suck-up licked Trump's ass. tried hand wave away testing early stages shitty, claimed WHO's test ""bad test"", also receive tests.

DeathSentence Yea never really use CDC data worldometer data much organize really use look world wide trends want see bad virus impacting countries. Uh oh, gastrointestinal issues plus skin lesions covid19 symptoms.  common ones, common enough. believe smuggled supplies got intended go. I'm still heartsick ones stolen ransomed out. took special kind evil greed. change calories people hyperthyroidism eat more. making excuses lazy, undisciplined people.

First, talking HYPOthyroidism, HYPERthyroidism. People hyperthyroidism often eat still lose weight. underweight huge problem people hyperthyroidism. 

But talking HYPOthyroidism, opposite problem produces opposite effect. 

People medical conditions aren‚Äôt lazy. incredibly ableist thing say. 

Are paraplegics lazy get chairs? That‚Äôs ridiculous sound.

Not everyone hypothyroidism eats much. fact, many eat nutrient deficiencies it. However, they‚Äôre fatigued, also don‚Äôt expend energy remain overweight. body physically CANNOT make use calories. lack energy isn‚Äôt matter laziness. 

That‚Äôs given medication, improve. don‚Äôt magically become ‚Äúless lazy‚Äù. bodies simply able process calories make use better rather storing them.

Many people even INCREASE caloric intake, bodies make use calories, able active lose weight. would make much sense. Texas (back day) fine country, trade. Now...not fine join US, acceptably well. There's reason states same, except think there's whole mess interdependencies centuries would unholy mess unravel. looking Britain leaving EU decades, pretty apparent easy way unzipper based purely geography.

This Q &amp; New Yorker columnist Isaac Chottiner Elena Hontoria Tuerk, clinical psychologist University Virginia specializes child family therapy. know don‚Äôt? be? Surprised hasn‚Äôt learned anything Texas governor similar stupid stuff forced reverse stand. they? people fucking like rabbits buying condoms, Mr Durex CEO?

Because according obgyn babies already way! Business good. Best line: ""I wouldn‚Äôt let children eat candy handed administration. snakes better parental instincts people."" Mario Makes sense America especially south getting hit hard right now. couple weeks lot deaths. expecting try hide data. don‚Äôt think use phrase anymore proven not, fact, avoid it. Makes sense consider upside-down times. Little Dark Age.  experience bad wave UK, cases rise rise mortality rate increase also. hospitals become overwhelmed less able provide ideal care treatment.

All means deaths going spike Go home yankee, propaganda Exactly!
His family deserve compassion living guy zero compassion others! 2-14 days. people die every Halloween wearing latex masks? /s fuck people come from. literally easy spot you. Vague comments pointing direction far-off conspiracy kept ambiguous enough even clear fuck talking about. kind test it? fucking kidding me?

And two seconds check comment history always lockdown_skepticism anti-mask subreddits bullshit.

Crawl back wherever came from. Oh sure, we‚Äôve people New York coming eat place. Like why?? I'm hoping least weeks lead time time, time teachers prepare better strategies. Last term, tossed need remote teach like twelve hours prepare overnight it.

Though students still going work well for, learning styles. FB friend two kids, younger Syndrome. Even older brother help, get near much going school resources like occupational therapist speech therapist stuff. Quick judge. far over. dont need another shut down, people would stop stupid wear damn mask! definitely seems tired cranky now. Given minute half, start 10 sentences without finishing days. That's idiocracy stuff right hope it‚Äôs true. definitely read articles back february march this, whole lot information available. Chinese studies referenced. need gung-ho 2a larping activists enforce mask wearing locations. Service guarantees citizenship! breaks heart hear news like health workforce irreplaceable. skills, knowledge, experience hard attain new workers replace that. truly travesty protecting health workers better. Here's Indiana's latest case/death charts, running hotzones, they're well curves gone way down. course, may change. actually enforce mask requirement.

Of course result shot US already happened. stabbed.

Sigh. amazing country live in. private sector monolithic wind patchwork different policies wind effective community-wide mandate. People going die this. That‚Äôs way is. Come terms stop getting emotional. statistical majority get however, they‚Äôll fine.

Have going out? Yes. gone restaurants, gone gym, gone shopping, hit coffee shops. 

Do follow rules go out? Yes. Absolutely.

I wear masks public, keep social distance, keep sanitizer use frequently. 

I‚Äôm happy play rules, age (mid-30‚Äôs) I‚Äôm going spend 24/7 locked apartment (as 3+ months) disease that, frankly, won‚Äôt kill me.

I‚Äôll follow rules laid officials go out, sense normalcy life make feel like it‚Äôs worth living.

If you‚Äôre introvert spend day alone apartment, good you. people can‚Äôt that.

Whatever side land on, society needs realize there‚Äôs acceptable level death. need come terms move life. look death rate, manipulated 'confirmed' cases count. older younger teen. depressing watching go school. 

They taught 'stuff' 'how think'. schools time that. Everything tied funding, tied standardized testing. everything revolves around (a different world young).

It's awful. kids stressed.

Ideally, would like see system kid's needs addressed whole picture looked (it check box math pass not... kid grows best chance successful adult).

I blame individual school teacher. system garbage. I'm sure teachers schools would change too, could. let make sure i'm understanding this. person runs daycare never want run day care ever again? safe open home space ever again? I'll take bet, want put money it. Ok, basically something never happen USA. 


Outlining fantasies really help anyone - can't force individual governments cooperate ""worldwide efforts"". appreciate enthusiasm whoever created I'm pretty sure people charge give fuck want. Seriously. eaten one meal takeout since February. used least one meal take day. don‚Äôt miss much thought able save more. Sure miss foods can‚Äôt don‚Äôt time make, family, broken fast food habit completely. 

It‚Äôs crazy months ago, running around cough-inducing foggy laser tag place six months back. Movies, too. can‚Äôt imagine now, seems tangible month ago. can‚Äôt wait normal return, normal be? show awful. full anecdotes passed science. experiments shaking head flawed were. panel discussions slanted thought watching Fox news. 

I lost respect show.

But right, need real science beat COVID-19. Reddit doing? grandmother always said, ""A smart person learns others' mistakes. foolish person learns own.""

Been thinking lot lately...

Edited fix smart/foolish mixup.  give them. Anything else tantamount murder think greatly overestimating amount overweight obese people actually suffering medical issue related thyroid. 

Yes exceptions, vast majority us, CICO end losing gaining weight. Anything else making excuses delusional. eat rich instead stimulus checks. You‚Äôll find another one, believe lost limb. I'll think cancer hop along. post blatant lie. phaseout started happens: stimulus check amount phases $5 every $100 certain income levels based tax filing status. means stimulus check get reduced $5 every $100 adjusted gross income $75,000 (individual/single filer), $112,500 (head household) $150,000 (married.joint filer) maximum income threshold. feeling they'll breaking records least 3 times week next month Gag. Damn, thought I'd forgotten this. embarrassing read, stomach turns uncomfortably remembering this. like see something cringe wanna change channel. can't change channel real life.... ‡≤†_‡≤† reals. lot people think obesity means land whale argue bring facts. Yes true. task force balanced knew asymptomatic carriers COVID low PPE supply. Go fl Wild West nothing State it. haven‚Äôt even there‚Äôs subs say otherwise. feel little tackers. don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, wear mask they‚Äôve got little say it. I'm sorry son. fuck Douchebag. repressed memory horrific movie. Thanks reminding torture. Asshole. reinforces point. would hurt him. chance gaining NEW voters point. clutch pile shit existing target demographic hope produces diamond. regressives LITERALLY TRYING KILL US.

But Trump voters a-okay dying emperor. employees. 

Their hazard pay cut. handle anti masker morons day. Kroger couldn‚Äôt give two shits employees health. They‚Äôre merely existing... unsafe environment.. surrounded greed madness.

I don‚Äôt blame minimum wage, often highschool college level employees taking proper precautions. 

Which also go shop elsewhere employees treated better. People Cal definitely be, huge state. lot business final phase shut again. saw big white lifted truck spaced wheels GODGUNS vanity plate. imagine type person ""All vaccine belong us."" irony thick picking ""my body choice"" argument masks. Considering whole idea behind original usage none business cause harm. actually cancer, think that's came from. 3.6M x 10 = 36M infected

So maybe 10% population it. 

If assume takes 4 months infect 10% population, let's assume takes 50% population infected achieve herd immunity... would take 18 months get herd immunity (or 18 months infect 50% population). 

That pace obviously accelerates less prevention take. drastically slows prevention take. 

It also impacted long immunity lasts people get sick. last long, basically can't achieve herd immunity. 

Personally, I'll probably break laughing absurdity life vaccine becomes available right herd immunity achieved hehe. wake call. Obesity linked much health issues yet....its ok obese. look smokers/drinkers yet people chomping 20-30 cheeseburgers month one says anything morality issues.
I wish would announce fat higher chance covid kill im sure wake call people need. That's Democrats charge. they're charge want absolute power highest level. True. think ploy kill independent systems bring rich billion dollar organizations like Mercy take over. 

We see well worked Ashland. wtf unit 10 million? Guess thats happens currency based solely penny (1.3cents per Rupee) PECULIAR people employing ""undesirables"" never seem get prosecuted .  Yes, ""peculiar"". 


Throw farmers farm managers slammer jobs dry so-called ""undesirables"". 


OH, WOULD REQUIRE CONSISTENCY REPUBLiCANS. there's bunch anecdotal evidence people recovered, felt fine couple months, tested negative, symptoms come back tested positive again. lot still anecdotal, evidence starting pile up. Combined fact know people tested positive testing negative antibodies couple months later, looking like re-infection highly plausible. good thing... less contact need right now. Wonder ‚Äúself pleasure‚Äù sex products selling? [CTV update welp, better safe sorry.

keep safe over. I'll add that, instance, rare one gains immunity tetanus recovering disease, yet effective vaccine exists (although viral disease demonstrates drugs provide better immune response natural infection). immunization works but, like children Booster shots, adults probably need awhile. honestly suspect cats shown reservoir eventually. Heart disease contagious. nd rumor he's going run take Beshear's seat years. that's speculation I'm sure.

More likely Senator special election 2022. disagree. Unfortunately, parents lot say district actually getting place could make policy politically difficult us.

Our district lot really weird problems like that. Austin isn‚Äôt really ‚ÄúTexas‚Äù though. It‚Äôs California proof counted capacity point data longer reported CDC available public. seriously doubt are. think won‚Äôt able fully get picture impact compare year‚Äôs mortality data compared previous years. Thank posting facts tirelessly This. boggles mind people argue taking action virus blame China, whether think deliberately made it, suppressed information, got consider odd possibly irresponsible food practices. really weaponized virus, would reason work hard quashing it, less. would reason pissed government protecting us drug PPE manufacturing US. Oh, way, people hate China much, look label clothes electronics rethink support purchasing choices? 
It if, morning Sept 11 everyone sat around debating whether cause problem Afghanistan, Taliban, US government conspiracy, aliens instead evacuating people buildings simultaneously buying trinkets organizations suspect.    
Let scientists US intelligence agencies worry happened (news flash, seem agree natural, well-predicted phenomenon) everyone else concentrate fixing survive take effective action prevent next crisis. US citizen sorry grammar spelling mistake.
We laughing guys. us difficulty understanding hell happening there. outside looks like people really aware dangers Covid side sort modern wildwest cowboys shoot Covid sunset. 
Another thing difficult understand resistance wearing mask ? problem wearing mask ? live, across Atlantic, masks mandatory indoors everywhere yet nobody complains that. might enjoy it, good. too: fucking idiots still allowed walk runs public without masks long? Wait, *weren't* requiring it? Life expectancy men 10 years longer US vs. Russia. sent message subreddit (coronavirus) maintaining list valid news sources suppressing. That's message practice subreddit prevents people seeing important information coronavirus - including guidelines absolutely must follow end pandemic. countries done we? Reddit admins get onboard ending this? stop this- health hazard violation rights Please? oof looks like lot effort put mental gymnastics, would shame nobody read cared opinion

Oh write you. know bad faith. wrote benefit 3rd parties might otherwise manipulated propaganda. 

Thanks puerile response, though, really outed bad faith actor showed true colors. A+ bye bye really well hit Stage 4 state's re-open plan. numbers shooting back ~~I suspect another week (if sooner) we'll peak curve again~~ strike that, checked data days, we're already there. governor, surprisingly good job listening data experts, chickenshit walk us back stage even take basic precautions like issuing mask order providing clearer guidance schools.

I'm just... disappointed, awhile there, beating every expectation state going this. require boosters, polio largely eradicated, really don‚Äôt know reinfection risk. Norovirus, Rhinovirus, Coronavirus don‚Äôt typically lifetime immune response mutate often develop lifetime immunity. there‚Äôs herpes lie dormant body erupt ever decade. wish otherwise, I‚Äôm critical care nurse. It‚Äôs probably going drive nursing. Americans considering french style democracy reign terror continues. Sars cov 2 targets too. Killer cells impaired, eliminate infected cells immune system dysregulation seen even 11 weeks infection. yeah, scare mongering things actually bad. imagine Bevin right now?

We'd rivaling TN dismal response. 

The thing saves kentucky we're mostly rural. lol tf, even read history. something related irony! ‚ÄúTo streamline reporting.‚Äù Yeah reporting infection rates goes much faster let White House decide look like week ahead time. F Shit think might right mean BMI hovers around 27 mostly eat like shit blood work done around 6 months ago nothing report. 

Yeah overweight obese lead complications experience seems like genetics play role fat people simply don‚Äôt develop things rate fat people. Urban sprawl. Metro Phoenix large contains majority population. they‚Äôre inside time year. Greece heavily dependent tourism constitute 20% whole gdp. simply can't tell truth. swede myself, think people exaggerating situation. 5000 people died large majority elderly underlying ilnesses since couple months back, virus never made lives feel miserable even without full lockdown. I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre trying live normal life possible still certain restrictions imposed government. countries still seeing pandemic contest who‚Äôs actions quickly result lowest infections deaths rather sustainable approach. also fear many refuse vaccine Yup, took lot shit it, large store I've gone 4 months.  stonk forget rise tomorrow. beat China!!!! please stop winning now? thedailybeast.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Oh, don‚Äôt ever worry Trump saying anything. happens, wait 10 minutes, he‚Äôs sure said something then. Watch videos, pass test. Get caught exactly opposite should? Fine double check.

It mean people lose immunity, anti-bodies part immune system fight Covid-19.

The Netherlands also observed people less severe symptoms lose anti-bodies faster Prepackaged foods likely fall category. licensed kitchen probably determining factor.  like able drink glass water one handed walk ramp. really useful. make basic mask cutting old tshirt putting elastic bands sides. goal form seal around face, bandana doesnt that, might stop dust, wont anything stop virus going out.

I'll leave this. understanding term ""Karen"". insulting term could construed racist context. I'm one seems think ""Karen"" refers angry, racist, white woman. use Latina describe women construed racist, response use term ""Karen"". suppose one could find Latin name like ""Maria"" ""Juanita"" describe women, would racist. see equivalence calling white woman ""Karen"" versus calling Latina ""Maria"". Like said, even friend Karen says term angry white woman. friend also seems think ok use term since ""punching up"" white people, white person comment someone another race punching down. love friend, wrong.

 

*Karen* slang term obnoxious, angry, entitled, often racist middle-aged white woman uses privilege get way police people's behaviors.

Sorry folks, need permit protest here, move along. Even Washington, lockdown unsuccessful standards Wuhan. goal completely suppress virus, reopen sustainable way, work. Yes, better Florida, hardly badge honor.

During lockdown, Washington still seeing 150-200 cases per day, ~500 cases per day. Unless start better, weeks 1500 cases per day, weeks 5000, Florida.

Either come lockdown R&lt;1. really almost binary pass/fail test, either way, exponential growth decay compound itself, eventually result same.

What we've found without universal masking home quarantine, going able reopen meaningful way keep R&lt;1, unless build partial herd immunity like New York, pay lot lives. 70% Germany‚Äôs 8,000 miles autobahn speed limits. sections autobahn rural. sections built speed limit 130 km/h.

So...follow logic...

If can‚Äôt social distance, must wear mask. driving built-up area, must adhere speed limit. See, it‚Äôs logical. correct. Maybe they‚Äôre referring first paragraph page 32. governor outlined orders seems like orders local governments deviate it? Lol. Ah yes dignifying. Im lucky enough like career. don‚Äôt make sound like taking minimum wage serve burgers groceries plague getting ‚Äúdignity restored‚Äù.

#FitbaGeography Farmer opens possibility closing barn doors horses‚Äô escape said barn. *Redditor 1 year.*

I don‚Äôt know saw coming year ago. Predictions next several months? mandate makes people say coronavirus hoax, people say isn‚Äôt serious, look bad. mandate upsets people want act like everything‚Äôs normal. THAT‚ÄôS harm mandate does. talked brother lives Ohio Dewine spoke. hot spot eager hear coming.

He said strongly-worded email. Well spilled beans, Goya. Welcome life crippling debt. Thanks Abbott. It‚Äôs fine fine. Death rates low we‚Äôre good Lol. 

This dude sun long. way past due matters anyone, learned term 'jab' Shaun Dead:

**Philip:**You call doctor, you?

**Barbara:**Well, thought ought safe side.

**Philip:**I'm quite right, Barbara, ran cold tap.

**Barbara:**I really think...

**Philip:**We jabs went Isle Wight. bunch overblown nonsense, bunch drug nuts running wild.

I wonder 'running cold tap' cure covid? can‚Äôt deny groceries, make wait outside someone else gets groceries you. Congratulations GA officially stupidest state Union week. think would better high level approximation time lag range could higher. Creating easily digestible statistics like difficult given lack transparency data.

Others thread mentioned morgues capacity could mean deaths even back. Florida states requesting refrigerated trucks morgues capacity.

Others thread also pointed phenomenon seemed interesting. looked 700% increase pneumonia one seems like theory misrepresents truth well. uses data sets coded two different ways. CDC debunked this.

I saw news sources reporting death rates average new cases last 7 days. seems short lag well. Good thing us store willing wear mask probably tolerate watching employees deal abuse. abusers numbered.  That's problem people. one takes things seriously virus hits them, someone know. becomes real them. Reminder large portion Texas right deny covid even exists coworkers, friends, family contract it. don‚Äôt know anybody knows lack knowing things. It‚Äôs already several mutations, one made infectious douche Germany shuts goes 0.05% (50 per 100,000) population week. I've never heard someone surviving people disease. matter usually die within 7-10 decades coming disproven though. Also know people disease joke. 

Sure people barely register it, lot people long term effects permanent effects, death. Proven 5G spread now. turned gay too. source this? herd immunity brigade holding onto lynchpin weeks now. That‚Äôs true also take account exponential growth speed spread probably going get even faster I‚Äôm herd immunity guy would crazy hit threshold anyways No, additional energy consumed. Rather, body isn‚Äôt properly making use energy mistakenly storing it.

A person may eating proper amount calories weight age, due metabolic dysfunction (the underlying cause could number factors) body isn‚Äôt converting energy fat storage. leads aforementioned fatigue.

A person suffering issue continue cut calories still see little improvement weight, fatigue. may even become nutrient deficient malnourished despite overweight.

This say calories crucial aren‚Äôt whole story. think they‚Äôll little saddened realize they‚Äôre killing base.

But they‚Äôre probably dumb realize November realize currently record unemployment 100k people dead virus?

Or actual facts jive well enough narrative, ignore them? would absolute nightmare scenario. hope workplaces strongly encourage staff stay home slightest hint illness. considering pulling kids school private online program? many well established, user friendly, interactive, inexpensive teaching programs around years. I've frustrated district invest one instead teacher essentially start scratch. Anyway, that's we're thought I'd pass along idea. mean this? feel like easier stay lockdown indoors cold weather. Americans still understand public health catastrophe wreck economy: Sophie's choice, pick one.

People consider pandemic ""no big deal."" I'm constantly told 135,000 dead ""nothing"" 330m, anything! Kemp high priest death cult Freedom kill neighbor selfish loser? keeps going... I'm sure people country could make movies could fill spots... no? Less spectacle, perhaps, can't believe there's lack people making movies. mean hell time *I* would make movie. someone else might feel same, actually make decent one! thought... maybe propaganda sources news convinced case. Come 'Merica it! People laughed Dr. Fauci said 100k new cases day. almost done it!!!  Man, crazy works, isn‚Äôt it? I‚Äôve heard don‚Äôt know from, happen article, I‚Äôve isolating away it‚Äôs complicated would like take care since symptoms little worse wanted make sure stay away make sure evidence it‚Äôs better stay away. trailers used morgues transport fruit, vegetables, meat ice cream. Soylent green all. amount posts written story short amount time shows definitely money behind new smear campaign. saying goes, western media marches lockstep, truth somewhere side.

Not mention anyone two braincells rub together immediately see white-faced lie, data regarding coronavirus vaccines supposed shared begin allegations come people spread many lies like Iraq WMDs, Russiagate, Skripal, Douma chemical weapons, Libya army rape, etc etc etc. wouldn‚Äôt getting business (if lived state mandate). They‚Äôll succumb pressure see sales decline people gravitate shop safe.  Probably 1 100, subs loves grasping straws Awe bad. Guess horses live another week. US government quite open pay seems dismal.

My position titled something else healthcare economist job working hospital system. like page 30000 people stand together streets virus casually decides spread agree sounds weird people ""steal"" vaccine research. mean, supposed together? want vaccinate entire world, logistics get much trickier. 

We need perfect, need 100%. still contend manufacturing going main constraining factor. Plus there's already organizations this, like Doctors Without Borders. programs already exist, we'd need provide vaccines, also additional funding increase many rural areas (no stores pop quick jab).

You head town places constant civil war.

Humanitarian organizations cover these. also relatively small % people trust doctors (there's history behind regions world that's led mistrust.)

Again, need perfect. policies make vaccination effectively mandatory (e.g. want get plane, go cruise, go conference etc? need vaccine) also help counter these. one fucked Hill politicians choosing die on. Fauci go Super Saiyan level 4 current administration

I glad see Fauci begin dig heals what‚Äôs right mean people require multiple shots per year? gonna scream now? People cancer heart disease definitely getting care Sweden, throughout pandemic. cancer treatments postponed height pandemic treatment would leave patient vulnerable covid-19, decision taken per-case basis deemed safe postpone treatment months. 

The ‚Äúcare debt‚Äù real, affect people non-critical issues. sucks, don‚Äôt pretend like cancer patients left die situation health care system. remember Chinese researchers found largely dismissed it. we're consistent; we're also mostly dismissing rare case...

Even likely, pad loss profit sudden change. Like give shit staff. Oxford vaccine project already said they'll make available all. Oh, doubt try downplay it. like bounty thing, directly political even see Republicans complaining it. Mayor Miami (a Republican), already balancing act criticising DeSantis ringing alarm bells new cases skyrocket city. implying could grab pencil clipboard call authority nonexistant place. Europe.

Oh... ""Technically"" europe. Spanish flu lot higher mortality rate could kill people day. burned killed people infected many others. different situations. give example name company offers this? Brilliant. got book. üôè Best Buy yesterday. No, they‚Äôre arguing food companies like Coca Cola aggressively push CICO-only propaganda avoid responsibility fact products contribute metabolic dysfunction. 

People control weight. I‚Äôm arguing opposite think. people find underlying issues metabolic dysfunction them. hopelessness fatigue nutrient deficiencies they‚Äôre suffering endlessly cutting calories seeing little progress doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs hopeless.

Rather, going doctor getting tested possible underlying causes metabolic dysfunction, finding golds better suit needs well medications may need, take better control weight loss.

I never said calories didn‚Äôt matter. said start they‚Äôre crucial. aren‚Äôt full story. 

At point need come grips fact eating constant garbage causes metabolic issues part problem, reducing calories alone isn‚Äôt practical way resolve this. 

We need address issues fronts.

People didn‚Äôt wake become lazy night. There‚Äôs reason obesity rates skyrocketing. There‚Äôs going eating (though eating much part problem). need leader happen. Well would protect sure hope would want something it.  Yeah, Israel demonstrated reducing case rate almost nothing (5 new cases nationally day) sufficient ""eliminate"" virus (with daily cases thousands). Medium term strategies required. temporary lockdowns. Wasn‚Äôt whole point flatten curve, overwhelm hospitals? seems like goalposts shifted towards eliminating cases, regardless lead hospitalization, sustainable long-term, especially average age getting infected gone down. Take example Mexico: remember said human-to- human transmission wasn‚Äôt possible. wasn‚Äôt airborne. literally 19 months ago took class specifically infectious diseases emphasis coronaviruses exactly made two tranmission methods are: humans, airborne droplets. 

Fuck CDC. also, already knew masks saved lives. come playing hero crying white house wont listen them. Imagine lieing first time around? dont know say, country built blood someone point. always knew Florida bad (I 24 years) confirms assumptions some... people truly bottom barrel. Others gonna catch eventually lol mortality rate high test many people? OK, skimmed country's [public news sources, Based available data, seems suggest infections caused symptomatic cases direct transmission infected close contacts &lt; 1 via talking, sneezing, coughing rather formite indirect transmission via hand contact. clear cases yet asymptomatic despite causing 0-2.2% infections people studies. there's available data quantifying number confirming mode transmission asymptomatic cases, better safe sorry society complete package (WHO): handwashing, respiratory etiquette, masks, social distancing, frequent disinfection.

Signed still 1000 :/ Death also tends cause male infertility, they‚Äôre technically wrong. Even cops said refuse enforce mask mandates ... fired Trump lover. short term job needed people, matter awful were. 

I used opportunity figure people actually loved Trump.

In end, guy completely miserable wants everyone else well. That‚Äôs people missing. Trump supports WANT everyone suffer are.

It simple that. virus hurts lot people, others feel pain. Along Ken rural Tennessee Facebook knows medical experts combined... smh. eagerly await Netflix documentary year two goes outbreak, hidden deaths, shady shit world. fyi walgreens require customers wear masks

source: get that! know mesnt make fun ""anti-maskers"" also anti vaxxers heartless anyone else.

Thing is, believe also people ambush anyone wearing one also minding business still social distancing stuff. would send death threats others question mindset beliefs, regardless sound might be, might brigade subs like others. think sudden influx types pro maskers forego discussion came thin air, you. know opinion popular one, tolerant that, knew r/centrist sub MUCH tolerant POVs one thread questioned messages going far.

I look way report sub since idea might coming from, guess can't find mobile. least easily. Honestly government told us air raids coming lose 2.3 million citizens turn lights cover curtains people would, half people listen we'd situation right [All four parks open Remember Oxford vaccine didn‚Äôt protect one 6 monkeys infection ‚Äúthe promising part‚Äù monkey died serious lung damage. like 99% humans. monkeys hit badly level humans probability 6 monkeys mild disease injected vaccine without effect would 94.1 %. Something think about. Eh, kinda true. going roll out? guess depends country, state/province country too. Lmfao. ""In experience"". So, different countries witnessed doctors falsifying cause deaths? Watched said covid killed covid killed them?  dude among best country seen all. He‚Äôs age fucks left give. think issue less masks make harder breathe. necessarily lowers oxygen %. Related greater numbers men experiencing severe illness mortality well, although obviously variables. ""Better put mask on, Mickey! A-guh-hugh!"" Kohls still thing? Fauci taking responsibility, someone take responsibility all. crazy thing they‚Äôre going shatter economy. Dead people don‚Äôt work. husband lucky. company extended work home sometime next year. chance boss would let work home even company goes back person?

If everyone reliably wore masks social distanced... enforced everywhere public... we‚Äôd functioning world over. countries do.  

Every time think block party, get mad. people think invincible don‚Äôt give flying fig they‚Äôre spreading it... they‚Äôre going find covid kills them, too:( us learn lesson. large scale protests Corona heard off. yes, I'm saying enough, yes, I'm saying abroad.

Again, people Philippines Serbia Chile large scale protests, you. give shit dangerous, that's ridiculous. friends live US numbers frightening. 

It feels like war virus, US government already surrendered.

But please give fight. win last wear mask go bars parties now, may take fewer lives get there.  mean something free internet product keep update list ""worst governors country"" every time look news today. Oklahoma's governor tested positive dumbass hanging public mask weekend.  talking Trump, right? official count deaths, assertion regardless whether aware not. aware official death count. proof aren‚Äôt counting cases? simply enough resources hospitalize even fraction percent population months time. 79 days using even medical bed 24 year old shows dangerous disease without fully operational hospitals. Keep mind early outbreak Wuhan strain, probably (according science) significantly less contagious later Bergamo strain. assume contained outbreak original strain prepared new one.

In fact seems anecdotal evidence goes way: containing outbreak Wuhan strain gives false sense security, Bergamo strain gets trouble. We've seen California well, (until upped response) Beijing Seoul. week ago, housemate said something almost word-for-word woman said quote immune system. 

I've come realize think person weak immune system enough build health back up. scary. know virus real. Yet, often swing caring caring one day worry wiping purchases down, wearing mask social distancing next act like everything getting back normal go take risks. almost like come excuses behavior can't stand able social things used pre-pandemic. SMH much. untraceable concerning, untraceable contacts gets hand  It‚Äôs enough know experience. country recently started reopening three month lockdown numbers surged radically President authority declare new emergency period himself. wants full total shutdown 15-day quarantine, political powers won‚Äôt allow it.

Everyone see streets wearing mask. Yet, people that‚Äôs problem. Especially since everyone afford stock N95 masks, ones people good enough protect people them...not wearer people. could control everyone wears mask, wouldn‚Äôt case surge.

According Stefan √ñsterstr√∂m, reason believe people received answer received wrong answer. problem high proportion samples according lab could analyzed.


**How many people left samples could analyzed?**
 
- dare comment that. case, large proportion.

**When think resume self-testing?**
 
- goal get started soon possible. come back clearer picture problem, says Stefan √ñsterstr√∂m.


The Swedish Public Health Agency procured service laboratory. regions Sk√•ne Halland, send self-tests laboratory, also problems analyses. Already two weeks ago, Region Halland issued press release stating many residents received answer technically incorrect, which, among things, must due handling problems marking samples. that, supplier has, among things, ensured samples transported chilled laboratory.

- start testing, proportion errors high. goal five percent. Two weeks ago, looked good proportion incorrect samples 5 percent. **Last week, proportion errors increased around 10 percent varies** follow day day close contact lab performs analyzes, writes Charlotte Nilsson-Bibin, communications manager Region Halland, email response Dagens Medicin.

In Sk√•ne, also talks supplier regarding problem samples answer cannot analyzed.

- discussions conducted together Blekinge Halland, region announces email response Dagens Medicin.

However, neither Region Halland Region Sk√•ne plans make breaks self-testing. Still can't believe come this. Feels like we're right back March. depressing. Already confiscated Trump. came together saw today's article C-19 might cause infertility. Darwin little jig heaven. Shit right. criticizing him, taking advice political issue? Texas! OH GOD!!!!!

I want see peer reviewed studies missing one year education extremely detrimental child‚Äôs well being. people US freaking clue big small EU countries are. number zero meaning without kind comparison.

I like make comparison country. many Americans know Texas four times size Arizona? Arizona slightly smaller Tennessee? Etc

Therefore, access healthcare makes already bad problem infinitely worse. genuinely believe figures compared other? booster every 3 months? even think ""does sound fucking stupid? probably repeat it"" clearly fucking stupid. Yes, unfortunately, that's option us. Also, seeing Americans can't get together, we're stuck wearing masks foreseeable future might well get used rather avoid inevitable go press hammer Republicans till passes.

I'm calling ""Great Reset"" knows land... 

Winter coming, going pretty... I'm sorry can't afford tested. feel faint experience dizziness stand? sounds awful. hope stay safe well. financial risk all, Vaccine manufactures held liable, Even reason cut (Gen 3) vaccines made human testing yet never got it, guess why. Never 1 APPROVED(meaning passed safety test, warp right now) Gen 3 4 vaccine mind set 4 week reminder? you‚Äôre right yay I‚Äôll congratulate you, you‚Äôre wrong call ostrich head stuck sand? plateaued mean dropped rising, sure. Reporting Jersey City. I've seen mask usage go past couple weeks watch rest country burn. Still jackasses wearing masks stores strict Well, got point guess. assumed case since experience that's lot countries counting deaths, presumably report based reported deaths way around.

I know italian though, say? data they're stealing company licensing agreements many manufactures, cost licensing less cup coffee. They're stealing company track millions doses produced year contracts 2bn doses produced within next year.

If got hands data patented first, actually sets us back providing global vaccine. nonsense stop Trump office. Everyone cares vote. need vaccine prevent Karens  imagine reality need get coronavirus flu shot equivalent make free jab everyone one season. Then, theoretically, spread controllable case numbers go way 3 months so. weight ranges gender neutral, take muscle comp account well variations frame size. It‚Äôs large are. 140, general close clinically underweight 6‚Äô0‚Äù person, let alone man. 140 lb man would stick figure weight. So, no, aren‚Äôt carrying 80 extra pounds 220. probably carrying lot closer 40 extra pounds. fat guy health anxiety, sucks. Also sucks can't tell what's anymore due age misinformation etc I‚Äôd surprised mask wears didn‚Äôt kind filtering material it. Yeah head hurts too.

I've decided that, absence evidence contrary, mild case cases means get shingles. Keeps worrying things can't control case. Could turn flu situation. Every year new vaccine ""flu season"" steroids people STUUUPIDDDD right go fucking restaurant thing still -_- Silver lining: Even 99.99% Americans infected, still get coronavirus ""under control"" 1-2 months. 


Just wait incubation infectious periods, right? good man. world fucking frightened shown us be. thing is, one election going fix this. Removing Trump nothing, system got us here, system fucked. core one political parties corrupt. think Trump bad, look guy like Tom Cotton others like him. evil Trump, brain. testing still piss poor even compared lowest testing us state obvious. They'll fix brakes. seems problem Sinovac going manufactured rapidly- expecting 100 million doses end year. even successful, see outside China least end 2021, Oxford's 20 times many doses end 2020. Ok excellent_tobacco talking science even understand masks even work? actually think putting coffee filter face? Yes right, somewhere line, changed tune urged DeBlasio close schools like whole week, DeBlasio anti-lockdown crying poor kids get free lunch. Touch√© Florida too. Correct. deaths matter huh? lets say wait till gen 3 , :D Places like Worldometer already sourcing data directly state county sources. Unless lot states stop publicly reporting, we'll still getting mostly amount data. Ugh.

My BMI pretty much right 30 (was around 32 locked March, so...progress, albeit slowly). eat healthy diet plenty fresh produce, whole grains, beans, etc, like cheese carbs (pasta potatoes, mostly) should. drink sodas, ever, rarely eat sweets chips - maybe month I'll chips, candy/dessert... that's maybe 5 times year most. take regular regimen vitamins, well. 

My husband said years supercharged immune system - cold takes week might make feel crummy day. Knock wood, I'm rarely sick meaningful way. reading even mild obesity causing severe COVID makes even nervous. 

Well, guess here's motivation really make go Couch 5K app. Lol Fauci actual expert field, there's way Trump even anywhere near intelligence. Pretty sure Trump intellectually common toddler average adult Amazing username. makes day knowing annoyed enough post it!!! going let medical professionals go

yes Masks trap virus particles latent forces electromagnetism. N95 masks ""filter"" air. miraculously effective everyone wears them, including infected person. Please stop spreading misinformation. know comedy shows ancillary characters crazy main characters, rarely totally normal person? character kind highlights reminds irregular everybody else is. That's Dr. Fauci. could easily Florida, free. dad one them.....back april , said ""what take , take seriously? deaths typical flu season?"" said ""yes""

then crossed 80,000 goes ""people ruled ""death covid"" accidents falls!!"" go ""ok many take seriously?"" said 100,000

100,000 passed. kept moving goal posts -_- said ""maybe 300,000 die year's end now?"" know said? ""1.5 million people died tuberculosis last year...why didnt wear masks then!?""

there's helping him....my god man...ffs really? Unfortunately July 6th [CanSino vaccine yet arrive know certain person still SARS 1 immunity virus isnt circulating? assume based T-cell memory, there's way prove it. Honestly whole world killed many people get rid trump listen. Like crazy world conspiracy true wouldn‚Äôt maybe think dozens world leaders might right?  remember this. Back new, thought first sign infected within 2 months getting infected, would develop flu-like symptoms. 

We know that's true now, presented elementary school class true. Whereas Tater-tot Mississippi essentially said soon already late prevent hospital overload local hospitals he'd extend totally-unenforced mask mandate county. We're going absolutely fine. Open schools, gotta get football money flowing.  clarify, among 5 treatments labeled ‚Äústrong evidence‚Äù, use ventilators prone position 2 them. screw masks ANTIFA strategy enslave us economy. Next thing know ban meat force us eat unpatriotic vegan food ^/s user screams ""Russian troll"". I'm pro vaccine get one, doubt. However, I'm mandating vaccines individuals. BUT, mitigate require specific vaccines jobs, schools, etc. people want partake normal society vaccine (unless medically they're exempt). Translation

Published 14 July 2020 16:10 love comparison proves masks work. Thank really Handmaids tale timeline then? better watch Gilead closely. Look Bill Nye trying good caring person. Touching. Man gotta say absolute worst time move south. Good luck, keep protecting much there. deniers going take gene pool. Best thing I've read week! üòÇ ""When said work surfaces dirty, felt degraded. like physically assaulted option shoot.""  Yes, saying. mean make sound like /u/CrankyWhiskers accusing divisive, I'm saying reasonable *effectively divides me* unreasonable. That's *if* viable vaccine found, safe. viruses vaccines made combat them. There's never virus common cold. know that's different family virus, scientific background comment intelligently beyond this. sayin'. world like vaccine found ""herd immunity""? shudder think that. never received flu shot. I‚Äôll first line town COVID vaccine. Again, patent licensing law I'm talking specific case (and gripes that, especially comes medicine). see specific instance stealing matters, mean dude stuck America, I'd love every medical researcher share 100% data get vaccine quickly possible. fucking kidding me. seriously trying kill us all? You‚Äôre supposed pm them‚Ä¶ Remember AIDS crisis? Remember Tuskegee syphilis experiment? unprecedented dude, US brutalized citizens one way another since inception. Let's even get they've treated foreign citizens.

What take guys stop blaming foreign bogeymen realize intrinsic America? worry, start going away hospital statistics rerouted White House. Mother Nature's revenge: there's many dumb, greedy fucks. I'm going kill many &amp; make sure survivors can't kids. That‚Äôs CA still keeping outdoor things open. make sense say wear mask keep spreading germs unless you‚Äôre eat feel free wear one put essential employee risk. big deal. feel like that's government whole, president. #TrumpFeverKills wow can't believe republiCONS gonna literally kill small margin base claim voter fraud. average death 22 days symptoms onset. Ok, let family comfortably claim Darwin Award. Florida getting excellent TV ratings attention they're getting. yeah, probably. clarified meant school knew option US result handled it. think also got get figure provide different way learn 4 additional months. doesn‚Äôt school kids screwed. school September preferably outside maybe 20 min added day next couple years add week two longer year.. Two things going here. Either right hand know left hand intentionally trying muddy water sow confusion save careers.

Neither two things good. makes annoyed. Covid rough MANY COUNTRIES zero new cases despite starting early spread. 

I feel like historians going quite harsh this, future students write essays things would better US president hadn‚Äôt trying win election cost civilian lives. There'd lot limp dicks getting blamed 'Rona too. D√©j√† vu posted already? Conclusion tiny number negative cases going change anything. Cedar Point once. One best memories kid. 30 went. I'm NYC. Even week March 16, schools got shut statewide, conversations people office tell serious was. Basically, state prepare people mentally much possible go lockdown mode. Remember national guard deploying New Rochelle? I'm convinced was

 a) test run,
 b) step towards getting people feel seriousness situation
c) excuse move guard closer NYC.

You gotta think time shut down, 8 recorded deaths (or low number like that) NY. Cuomo taking baby steps get us close point. believe idea people would react worried mass protests refusals. 

So yes, could shut sooner, would everyone gone along it? Ultimately went pretty smoothly. I'm convinced would smooth even 2 weeks earlier. really week saw petitions save students start circulate. think waiting enough awareness support order shutdowns. definitely will! /s even understand virus exponential growth works? That‚Äôs takes, majority town infected So, let's say 0.5% die, population 331+ million, get 1,655,00 deaths, numbers higher, hospitals run space really quick, states can't handle amount sick people rushing hospitals today, like Texas, 298+ thousand confirmed cases, would happen 29 million get sick 2 month period?

So I'd like guess 5 10% death rate, I\[m letting bunch idiots decide fate say like fact, presumption? Maybe bad thing....some people really allowed breed. coincidence also people wear masks...well guys anyway. Propganda censorship two different things. Propaganda (amplifying message encourage public belief it) obviously works. know example decreasing public belief something attempting remove discussion public discourse. course, prove counterfactual demonstrate it, could logical trap. think actually live Florida. part what‚Äôs making headlines. feels weird spectator. r/loseit lot guesses/speculation speculation say ‚Äúwon‚Äôt cause problems big models predicted‚Äù models? Sure find models low really high WH/CDC April settled model predicting 100000-240000 currently pretty accurate.  don‚Äôt know Sweden‚Äôs citizens compare US far taking virus seriously viewing social distancing important. US certainly lot people don‚Äôt take seriously help drag pandemic Peter Navarro director White House National Trade Council. huge proponent reducing trade deficit 2016, last year Obama administration, US trade deficit China 346 billion dollars 345 billion dollars. 2020 I‚Äôm pretty sure stimulus checks used people cheap Chinese Shit Amazon.

Not total douchebag, utterly ineffective anything trade issues China. Mr. Navarro needs worry job, Dr. Fauci‚Äôs job.

In 2019, year three Trump/Navarro trade regime, US trade deficit China Eat dick little kids. old enough indoctrinated, young bars. group people anti-vaxx. We're gonna get both! That's prediction, can't anything else completely insane happened year far. Maybe 2020 throw us bone go insane positive direction? must proud comment! citizen completely different country already reopened next zero cases. lifted finger since February except receiving parcels door remain, safe exposure, now. 

And everyone else afford it. 

The question is, control dirty disgusting disease spreading mouth long enough end braindamage?

Any virus infect brain specific virus causes lot cell damage coronavirus.

The sars-cov-2 virus attacks destroys immunity cells hijacking tissue make virus factories, immunity system responds infection simply beginning destroy living tissue. 

Remember splitting headache younger covid19 infected keeps saying get?

Healthy younger people really die often lung infections brain swelling leave surface brain permanently *knobby*. It'd actually kinda sad much brain scarring people live with, probably never really read things like plenty available scientific literature, perhaps even find picture autopsied brains help clarify potential permanent consequences swellings brain tissue. 

Good luck getting pandemic without loosing braincells! Dont worry, I'm sure despite mandatory mask control Germany, usa far better wearing masks. person said all. might pissed. know public statements calm rational. downvoted rational thought. There's fine line censoring someone's free speech censoring someone's ignorance put others lives danger. public service they're removing silencing ignorant uninformed people. Free speech never allowed could put others harm's way. school option; research EU shows option safe. 

Researched show EU able safely. United States utterly incompetent throughout duration outbreak absolutely conclude come anywhere close duplicating results EU. People United States even allowed EU right since massive community spread throughout large portions country containment site.

If United States fought COVID successfully Germany opening schools would no-brainer. Needless say happened. EU model cannot applied United States EU worry massive unchecked community spread. Well guy said look drinking disinfectants made possible take Gen 3 Gen 4 Vaccines. Gen 4 even approved veterinarian use. Gen 3 first approved 2009 still able used Humans. Trump signed it. sure FINE! You‚Äôd think anyone kids age would concerned, you‚Äôre sending kids school either care them, plain stupid, 35 years public health including pandemic planning, frankly, US reaction something could even contemplated. Record high numbers? Well maybe magic Disney make go away? Smh Florida. Vaccine making much reliable science oncology though. hope ""you"" metaphorical ""you"" wear mask socially distance, practice good hygiene listen experts. realize differing abilities though. Parent here. sending kids school matter what. worth it. people say ""But they'll fall behind!"" say ""Fall behind who!? We're BOAT!"" Correct started website show correct numbers ones state trying push. Tell people waiting 2-3 weeks get test results medical professionals sunbelt. get cases control first No, Trump fake numbers HHS.

edit: What? parents dead? FAKE NEWS! CRISIS ACTOR!!1 talking horse Another tactic fewer polling places. Jefferson County, KY (where Louisville is) one polling place 600,000 people. anti-vaxxers sure look stupid turn Captain America. agree, start  pace Florida reach Bronx deaths ""Kevin"" male version Karen, confirmed.  new lockdown, FHM worried increased spread people go normally don‚Äôt go see people normally don‚Äôt see? Weird lockdown. Yet somehow surplus ventilators UK one highest death rates... Classic right-winger: ""Nobody deserves help problem affects me."" Meanwhile country (Canada) partnered China reason, sent vaccine phase testing even though they're giving military market? [imports exports turned around increasing mislead people. I‚Äôll make conscious effort go outside! wish backyard :( live condo tell kids wear mask, they'll die. Kids age 9 pretty much believe anything adults tell /s Narcissism pretty much removed psychology manuals become prevalent social trait North America. Today adult means 18+. nothing social/familial responsabilities. infuriating story. :( Hey, worry: Disney World opening NBA starting back problem states comprised individuals, many vehemently disagree way leaders handling crisis. people don‚Äôt deserve punished live states run morons like Kemp, Abbot, Desantis. might happen year. everyone wants wait long crucial information. Getting peer reviewed research taking long time.

From cases I‚Äôve heard about, false positives undermined existence symptoms illness. Plus people become negative became positive I‚Äôm willing rule always cause. ""Just fine"" mean survival only? Many people survive covid, sure. heart damage, scarred lungs, strokes neurological damage.

Good luck beliefs. Obviously joke, that's exactly like it. prefer comedy little less biased. Like, Dave Chappelle makes fun black white people, made fun one would cringy. found Colbert Report cringy.

It's like celebrities say ""fuck Trump"" like kind witty remark; balls say ""fuck Obama"" ""fuck Trump"" meaningless, opinion. can't blame problems America today Trump Obama president 8 years. see get free pass; democrats. wasn‚Äôt fault government manipulated unjust wars. internet, info want known. Shit, Iraq War everyone initially that‚Äôs early days internet. We‚Äôre better informed though . wouldn‚Äôt blame soldiers. really die taking care people. That‚Äôs crazy me. deserve much respect they‚Äôre getting feel way. state required masks since march confusing first see retailers requiring it. often forget like places. guess government step mandate it, stores. situation probably looks different people within countries suppress information. Trump literally said intends stop testing numbers look better, asked joking, said joke.

Shortly after, CDC stopped getting Covid-19 data. unrelated coincidence. Trump openly trying suppress information country go making friends money thousands people dying every day. wait schools open, it'll really take off. Start new semester bodycount... Yeah going say thing. Bay Pigs, bullshit South America ultimately Vietnam severely tarnished reputation. Middle East bullshit past 30 years (of 2000 that‚Äôs it‚Äôs raging there). shit scared school late 70s mid-80s, oceans going die ‚Äúyear 2000‚Äù, going run oil 2005, rain forests cut going wear masks year 2010, didn‚Äôt really matter, hole ozone going kill us 1995. 

I pretty impressionable kid, read lot beginning age 7 eight. And, shoved us early grade school, increasing way end high school, late 80s, AIDS going kill us all. certainty backed ‚Äúscience‚Äú.

The older get, skeptical get. Everything said would happen happened yet. admit it‚Äôs getting worse, lot human-made. But, people keep breeding, there‚Äôs nothing done that. Thanks bntgdzyzwndxyz news, im sure everybody fucking listen you. really need willing able allow encourage people grow learn mistakes. difficulty determining whether truly changed better. fine line, example happy see mask worn DJT doubt changed significantly better. knows Chuck Woolery learning anything hope is. wants pandemic continue GOP suppress voting November. Oh man, libs got him, too! /s generally true entirely accurate. idea exercise ""I hit gym 30 minutes three times week"" - unless ultra-high intensity cardio exercise calorie burn drop bucket. Light weight lifting jogging talking maybe 100 calories day difference averaging across week that. adds up, authorize slam ice cream, pizza, beer. 

There massive difference sedentary active lifestyles though. quarantine I've swapped underdesk treadmill standing desk I'm walking around 20 miles day burning 2000 extra calories daily it. physically active - even low intensity - throughout day makes **huge** difference total calorie balance. 6 weeks might stretch remember early on, sometime late February, everyone completely freaked hell governor saying three thousand cases constituency. That's likely fake news misstatement, man... Things changed quickly. Every new individual case felt like start apocalypse.

We're far slipstream shit even react hearing 3,000 new cases *my state* anymore. Maybe data rerouted White House like daily case reports. handed straight away, knock middle man!  actually kinda funny. realize fighters good amount mass height weigh around middle healthy bmi area height realize wrong are. people lot fatter think are. ruled idiots, everybody aspires one.  find lawyer take *that* case contingency? Whodathunkit! even know sure yet. people survive may long term medical issues varying degrees. know nothing long term effects yet little know, indicates serious long term health problems lot people. want attract people Walmart, required masks starting July 20, 2020. Science bad. Visceral reactions coming fervent tribalism good. RemindMe! 30 days Thanks response. think important hear many experiences (mild severe) virus possible. Nice hear doctor noted irregularity typical, continued ""gentle"" exercise recommended. Also live Florida. incredible many idiots live here. getting tested school covid case pops up? entire classroom + everyone contact person? they're supposed go city testing facility pay test? another person tests positive? class contacts go back city get tested again? covid eradicated? Schools never able function.

The problem waiting vaccine 1, idea be, 2, think parents gonna rush right get kids, rarely susceptible covid, shot foreign substance possibly rushed? We're taking years here, spring hope political post information sub, cause real concern.

the US coronavirus data managed michael caputo, guy that's putin's payroll decades mentored roger stone. 

This rigged get go. msm covering this?


michael caputo [was picked trump join hhs Assistant Secretary Public Affairs last 

caputo collecting disseminating coronavirus data previously managed CDC.
 . political operative qualified work government administration, nevermind health human services. mentored working roger stone since met jack kemp's campaign.

caputo moved russia 1994 worked advisor pr guru boris yeltsin. takes credit yeltsin winning election.

caputo's big break came 2000, Gazprom hired pr work. Specifically, hired increase putin's public standing approal throught globe, particularly us. 

in 2000 caputo moved palm beach, became tight roger stone worked pr efforts russia/putin's behalf ever since. carl paladino campaign. ukranian politician campaigns...

in 2014 trump hired caputo manage astroturfing campaign boost trump's chance winning bid buffalo bills. 

in 2016, offices ny, miami moscow, caputo joined trump primary campaign.

later, june 2016, fired trump campaign paul manafort joined campaign manager.

then, caputo got drawn russia investigation/mueller investigation coordinated efforts roger stone outreach russia wikileaks. I'm saying, narrative people oppose afraid go vote far reality.  logic. Bolo Modi bhagawan ki jai Knut would Norwegian version neither variations mention would used Norwegian language. makes think America anything offer.

The one thing noticed pandemic, silent US compared rest world. studies seem coming Europe. president tried buying exclusive rights vaccine created Germany. Much learning coming Italy, France, germany south Korea.

Why 1st world research centers, state art virology centers, thing America seems confirm studies already done. happen New York, friend works highway department staged trucks yard. Weather used entirely different story. Kudos county's response. I'm trying survive among cultists think CV19 cured halting testing it. mandatory symptoms possibly COVID? woke yesterday sore throat dry cough. runny nose stuffy nose. think maybe drainage throat. sore throat dry cough still besides feel fine. 

I looked getting CVS tested, use nasal swab, worth since nasal cavity isn‚Äôt runny? president told flu would go away like magic! I‚Äôm confused. suppose we're going consistent posts states, thank governor. would‚Äôve powerful statement didn‚Äôt add last ‚Äúreading comprehension.‚Äù  absolutely plan stealing election. No, would ineffective healthcare workers getting sick. 

They are(in mass), they're wearing masks, therefore surprising healthcare workers still say masks work colleagues dropping like flies. think efficacy masks community settings is? Forget case study back May CDC still keeps circulating week, actual good data based meta-analysis cluster-RCTs, cohort studies, case- control, cross-sectional studies is? figures despite CDC finding appropriate still circulating one case study two cases May. don‚Äôt think telling us number instead focus old case study two cases May? Por que los dos? Fair enough. get impression reddit everyone really wants Boris Trump 2.0 reason, I'm really sure why, suggested could people bored Trump brand new news report ran one US' three old school major mainstream news networks. understand aware US media pay close attention it, CBS one Big Three old guard almost definition establishment media. 

I know many want hear badly Sweden failing want censor news failures, scroll by. USA winning lies, usual. Good. N.J., can‚Äôt cross street without wearing mask. It‚Äôs time. Company says it‚Äôs helping community, Target should‚Äôve done long time ago. also claimed can't wear mask experiences symptoms shortness breath, dizziness, asthma mask acne, according KGTV. went show KGTV documentation 2015 pelvic exam, well note chiropractor saying Gilles ""has underlying breath conditions prevent wearing mask."" 

The sad part anti-maskers think alternatives. San Diego, there's plenty Starbucks drive thrus use. UberEats also delivers Starbucks.  no, wants go Starbucks cause scene. I'm Nigerian, confirm Think getting normal size necessarily skinny. help make sustainable changes, crash diets work can't stay forever. make small changes like adding veggies lean meats diet watching portion size everything else. normally eat 5 slices pizza, 4, small changes like that. lost 30lbs 2 years way longer obese 25lbs away longer overweight. create calorie deficit, small one take longer much easier maintain since drastic change. main thing cut surgery drinks, diet water. guy. Please tell us rise cases translate hospitalization death.

""It may sound bad maybe virus ‚Äútook out‚Äù vulnerable ran it‚Äôs rounds. it‚Äôs running general working population typically younger healthier shouldn‚Äôt critically affected."" - PeacewalkerGG insult wrong compliment swallowing pride admitting wrong. person sum flaws sum flaws virtues. mask cuts COVID-19 risk 65%, experts say



A range new research face coverings shows risk infection wearer decreases 65%, says Dean Blumberg, chief pediatric infectious diseases University California, Davis Children‚Äôs Hospital.

‚ÄúOn issue masks, I‚Äôd like restart‚Äîbecause we‚Äôve learned lot,‚Äù Blumberg says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve learned due research additional scientific evidence. know masks work important.‚Äù approve! 
Especially gets teens masks week top symptom changes..one week vomiting next week coughing body aches fever guess week headaches. course don't, saw shit facebook status post sister law's second cousin who's ex nursing school drop out. government didnt pay people stay work like rest world did. I'm self employed even got 3.4k May, ill get another ~3k August. Living Florida feels like gaslighting 24/7. People act like you‚Äôre insane taking precautions. Sure could get sick get could die. Even survive there‚Äôs still long term damage. Like people want ill? think you‚Äôre fine, don‚Äôt let people make doubt yourself. I‚Äôd lying hadn‚Äôt momentarily thought thing people catching it.... good. side wants fucking win, break bread fascists. go lecture openminded Thank service kids‚Äô intellects. kind you. People need realize this. Sewage samples world dated November earlier testing positive. people saying ""Brazil lied! People died!"" everywhere? No? dude France COVID-19 early December recent international travel history? That's highly likely community transmission, nobody trying sanction France. Spain, sewage samples November coming back positive? virus around world since November least, country due diligence identified it. Honestly, China's greatest mistake discovering taking seriously. Oh like hope catches on. know loves stamping name shit. Good luck this. set reminder early April prove point someone confident total cases would rise average number annual flu cases. weeks later happened still going up, response ""all numbers faked"".

People level denial likely accept wrong show hard data. Although there‚Äôs many claims hospitals misreporting COVID19 deaths actually seen sources proof. claims focus fact hospitals get paid COVID19 related deaths - actually misleading. Hospitals may get reimbursed bit - people Medicare. reimbursement cover total cost care though. There‚Äôs detailed article misinformation here:  

The CDC inflating numbers constantly adjusting numbers actually review death certificates. might get report stating County 100 COVID19 deaths - report - verify number actually receive death certificate. ton verifications. Sometimes process takes ages - months - backlogs occur. year finalize work. 

You probably heard years back, 80k people died flu. number widely quoted initial report(and estimate). Well year later revised total 60k. numbers dead COVID19 take process. doubt cast numbers pushing transparency stats, increasing guidance reports people dying COVID19. See here: 

The CDC well known respected. I‚Äôm Canadian family in-laws US, lot respect data. believe number deaths might under-reported number deaths much higher well documented number deaths. Case point, look numbers state compare. 

If places reporting 100% positive tests likely testing people already presenting symptoms. perhaps possible there‚Äôs something else going on...Where seeing happen? know Kroger owned them, damn Yes also usually saying specifically need cover, like genitals. seem like much stretch add nostrils &amp; mouth list. Tax prep companies (such H&amp;R Block Intuit) lobby government make taxes confusing complicated, meaning people seek out. also lobbied 20 years prevent free self-filing software IRS (including autofilled tax documents common countries), notorious offering ""free"" filing services end costing consumers amount people qualify ""free"" filing ridiculously small. addition, routinely trick customers siloing costlier version product can't backed of, meaning customer either complete tax documents preparer pay fee throw away effort they've already spent year start different preparer.

In youth, age dinosaurs, children still got infected Chickenpox vaccine around yet. children would get **twice**. first case would mild create proper immunity they'd get second time later on.

Canadians, also watching country implode last 4 years...in fact, know 4 MILLION US citizens actually immigrated Canada since Trump took office...no joke, population literally increased 5% ***JUST*** Americans immigrating get away fucking insanity there

that's truly insane one red paper clip got traded house! International flights allowed, rules land borders apply. Americans without valid reason enter Canada flown back US. like around world since thing started.

Everywhere began experiencing worst pneumonia-related spike deaths since records began exact time pandemic started really kicking off. thinks it‚Äôs telling spend time children‚Äôs forums.

I would love read book *12 Rules Life: Coping Idiots*

I'm sure time write it, right? Welcome 2020, order true American Patriot must oppress government even means potentially killing family, friends fellow Americans. stop choosing identify ego? choose love? Whether agree not, wish everyone best confusing time. America, leader first world, sliding third. bad decision, yes. look framework nation fumbling response across board? Yes. see mistakes every single political leader local national? Yes. Tbh, I‚Äôm really hard time blaming anyone early day responses. think, overall, early days disaster every single state. lived died learned. think, however, Cuomo one leaders rose occasion eventually. late yes meant. I‚Äôm **not** saying governor image competence, whole country got watch paid complacency, it‚Äôs confusing watch emulate us *before* learned hard way. type test like antibody ones, article Karolinska Institute study found twice many Tcells antibodies explained complicated test takes time (worktime actual time sure). we're real unlucky antibodies attack cells Homeschooling. Parents across America teach children home.  imagine teachers, want return classroom, mentored parents sent packets kids could taught parents thought could never homeschooling.

There probably lots options, like adapting 'bubbling' schooling... state legislators seem reaching people could brainstorm viable solutions.

Personally, think biggest problem takes 2 parents working pay bills. think solutions problem too. confidence Redditors could break working groups come ideas worth testing. prion contaminated drinking water. Prion diseases take months years show symptoms, untreatable 100% fatal. How's scary scenario. like someone saying something incredibly racist. Then, response ""that's offensive (insert race here)"", fire back ""why everything race you?"" worst much avoidable unnecessary. I'm cracking image sticking baby's leg drive thru window. freaking time. say Target Team Member. Ugh people think they're invincible!
How hard wear mask get discouraged! great! caucasity Ever Florida Summer? question sanity wellbeing anyone takes stroll 90 degree heat 99% humidity think that's reason continue development male birth control, cease trials. guy, I'd feel way safe non-permanent birth control option beyond condoms, oversensitivity types issues shut trials means I, anyone else wants it, may never get security. makes sense . politics

The bigger lie, believe it. mean, *entering* war justified. shit US war absolutely horrendous, doubt, I'm gonna hold individual soldiers responsible that. signed up/were drafted war (and I) considered necessary.

Now draft, US soldiers volunteer service make choice fight horrible wars themselves. really narrows down. think came hiding numbers infected, Florida led charge. What's special healthcare workers contracting Covid patients versus diseases? 

How often healthcare workers contract illnesses patients general flu, pneumonia anything else? stuff works, sure, many operations postponed. Including lot transplants: link ITT opreations, queue HUGE (200,000+) mom able get care though! mask prevent getting transmitting virus. reduce transmission means solution. 

Especially cloth cheap ones people wear poorly.  Chuck suck deepest, darkest parts ass. Fuck guy. wish gotten instead son went Target yesterday everyone wearing mask except one woman three pre-schoolers. mandate takes get store make shopping safe everyone it. shop stores now. national shut March lead this. made sense completely shutdown TX FL time limited number cases areas. track trace became bad NY consumed testing areas could contract trace. happened shutdown NY high impact areas create travel quarantines. Stop source.

Now, merely punishing states impacted earlier control reason want to. can't ""officially"", bet DeSantis Kemp taking cue Trump. Trump reversed course got Fox News board, highly likely certain Kemp DeSantis also change course. epidemiologist NPR way back beginning said something along lines ""if looks like reaction, probably right."" point come side asking really necessary. come side dragging dead behind asking one anything.

If India mortality rate Sweden, they'd staring **800,000 deaths**.

Needs respec research tree part ""based information currently available"" understand? reading comprehension issues actually scientifically illiterate? Rhetorical question. warned human-to-human transmission January 14th Chinese CDC confirmed human-to-human transmission January 20th. Guess what, new evidence emerges, scientific claims *aren't simply based anecdotal accounts* like seem think. Wuhan entered lockdown 21st. really think days would made difference? virus already spreading undetected November Brazil, France, Spain, among countries first hospitalization China. Yet pinning blame solely Wuhan Municipal Health Commission? fault country learn China, Australia, South Korea, Taiwan, among others, respond this? Get head gutter.

Moreover, public panic exactly last thing would want previously undiscovered virus actually culprit. panicked people unnecessarily flooding hospitals suspected cases, clogging healthcare system catching virus people actually it. Common sense clearly strong suit.

Looking county-level data Johns Hopkins, case simple divide East vs. West. mentioned article, cases peaked Yakima county early June--I think reason hopeful new deaths per day start decrease Yakima. WA State DOH data claims incomplete 7/7, seem indication hospitalizations Yakima county decreasing early July, also would expect case peak somewhere early- mid-June.

Cases King county rose early June early July, last week, 7-day rolling average shown steady decline \~150 cases/day \~100 cases/day.

But Snohomish Pierce around 10/day new cases early June around 35-50/day, would concerning remain trajectory. also couple eastern counties concerned about, especially Benton, almost bad Yakima terms cases per capita.

The biggest thing optimistic 7-day rolling average cases/day level counties 200K population last 7 days. Since 7-day rolling average trailing indicator, potentially indicates cases flattened (or decreased areas) since roughly July 6th 7th. Perhaps July 2nd mandate businesses customers wear masks effect. would really happy cases could decline given current business restrictions--it would give us hope could eventually lift additional restrictions case counts decline. still worry interstate travel given states clearly completely uncontrolled outbreaks, there's much done sit (other voting fall.) local nw suburbs Chicago Target required masks months. guess that's part Illinois covid rules. least one good thing Illinois done lately.

Even far doctors nurses staff locally, they‚Äôve still struggled keep number cases. live one highest concentrations medical facilities staff, even struggled keep pace spread even full lockdown relatively great compliance community terms social distancing, self quarantining, mask usage.

It seems option try harder slow spread rate keep treating, there‚Äôs nowhere could keep pace treatment without significantly reducing rate spread. limited treatment capacity (the fewer doctors nurses), need try slow spread limit cases needing treatment point time.

As bad situation is, seems we‚Äôre fortunate find masks, distancing, avoiding confined spaces poor ventilation, etc help reduce rate spread quite lot ‚Äî good easy/cheap things big impact. sure one size fits solution. missed critical point throughout shutdowns.

So, dosent really make much sense IMO, people dont want say that‚Äôs absolutely fine people completely within right it, people want it‚Äôs personal choice also fine.

Considering people trying CONVINCE vaccine groups allow challenge trials, it‚Äôs safe say people want it. say let them, it‚Äôs really want, it‚Äôs imperative understand risks so. That's fine understandable course, saying ""people"", implying widely deadly.

I guess question phrasing then, that's fair enough. Social distancing protect at-risk groups one course great, think unnecessarily scaring people way go. can't even idiots anymore... point anyone voted fool deserves Rona. story standing line, leaving getting positive result one making rounds. Everybody knows somebody . Planted propaganda via bots. countries introduced countermeasures virus got completely control.
They never resort draconian measures.
Meanwhile US healthcare system, atleast heavily affected states, hand currently process collapsing weight daily increasing number cases popping up. least lower last couple days Thank God! 

Was Target couple months ago everyone wearing masks checking door let tool wearing American flag back pocket said health condition. asked manager kind gave shrug. guess pathological stupidity DSM now. Hi! teacher Texas. say anxious reopening understatement, questions hoping someone could answer level risk walking fall.

**Background Information:**
I teach rural school district, school serving 300-350 students. county teach fewer 20 active cases, per Gov. Abbott's orders, required mandate face masks time. school given answer whether staff students required wear masks, &amp; said following Texas Education Agency governor's instruction, currently states students required wear masks county required. wording reopening plan students ""MAY"" required wear masks classrooms, definitely going required passing periods buses. Students normal lunch assigned seating social distancing. Texas schools required offer remote learning option in-person option, anticipate many parents opt remote option. parents work, honestly remote option sounds really unappealing way presenting it. I'm anticipating regular day, see 90 kids, last year biggest class 22 students, smallest class 8. teach 9th 10th grade.

**Questions:**
1.) going enforce face masks class even district doesn't. wearing mask shield. Given smaller class sizes teaching rural district, risk contracting COVID?

I want add rural, remote lot traffic town surrounding areas heavily affected COVID. Numbers rising area, reported cases doubled since start month.

2.) additional safety measures taking consideration? obvious hand washing hand sanitizing, anything else considering far classroom protocols? think misunderstood saying. Great analogy, yes! love winning! 
/s censorship? still spewing nonsense one gonna stop embarrassing yourself. Go, free. Milli Gang. 7 shifts hospital us don‚Äôt get N95s all. We‚Äôre also supposed wear surgical masks 3 shifts. chick sold soul Yeah China caught thing months ago everything read made sound like serious affront.

But why? cares? I've yet see hear journalist explain that. think one ten. UK symptom tracker app reported 200,000 3 million users symptoms 6 weeks longer. insignificant number. ok whats connection opinion?  Cause it‚Äôs America mean, get bully asshole would ever need think?

It blows mind pervasive idea ""boring"" ""lame"" try hard think. seriously firing guys left right?  reported number infections, overall number infections estimate - need account asymptomatic mild SARS-COV-2 infections never got tested. 8% referring probably case fatality rate (CFR), looks tested positive COVID-19. New Jersey huge outbreak early on, testing limited reserved seriously ill high-risk groups, CFR relatively high- people infected, mild symptoms, get tested COVID-19. good,dudes! pro sports leagues access same/next day covid test results teachers ""hero"" essential workers wait 14 days theirs. unlikely players catch virus playing.

Cite? agree hiring special security mask compliance one right ways could go, relying people signed grocery store shelf stocker wrong way go.

I think they're going it. think see choice regular minimum wage employees enforce it, mask mandate. paying employees enough make worth hiring people dedicated task would cost more. Everybody *wants* open schools, let ship sail decided reopen bars venues first. mandated fairly strict nationwide lockdown summer, might position start kids school...but didn‚Äôt. 

Now, there‚Äôs way safely states unless lockdown hard weeks again. even then, it‚Äôll game whack-a-mole frequent school closures nationwide plan. Thank you. True accords. Yeah guy stole election Stacy Abrams. can't wait vote office. Hopefully able disenfrachise voters again. Texas!  /s obviously talking America. Bring on!!!

Inaccurate counts problem. They're going inaccurate matter what, like example gave. infected heart attack, likely died virus attacked circulatory system. 

But, could easily infected, day two infection heart attack - likely caused covid time damage yet. There's real way know instance.

The real problem people trying politicize push misinformation. Like gentleman PA car crash admitted. hospital showed signs covid, tested him. week later dead pneumonia. People latched said counted car crash fatality covid death. Well, - didn't. died covid induced pneumonia well week car crash. -	Wayne Gretzky expensive enough, less people test, less confirmed cases=win Trump busy fertilizing anti-China narrative.

I'd interested see Karen's crowdfunding attorney going. bet pockets instead getting lawyer King Tegnell all: hey Bj√∂rn Olsen says he's probably right. doctors constantly exposed virus likely get worse symptoms get exposed say grosery shopping stuff like that? feel like people dont understand biology behind this. Immunecells receptors targeting certain antigens virus antigens remembered immune system. 

The problem viruses, corona viruses included, ability quickly alter antigens, get common cold flu every year. would case Covid19 would huge issue. would least take months fast mutating viruses, (correct im wrong) think Covid19 Viruses mutating rather slowly compared viruses. case impossible sick get reinfected strain Coivd19 Virus weeks (or probably months) after. can't believe sheer numbers people wearing masks wrong. Ughughughhhbh. first all, NY already closed two months, great cost, reopened COVID crisis tamed, implemented things like mandatory mask wearing, reopened bars gyms, contact tracing place, among mitigation efforts...

I fully support closure states meet specific criteria open, NY State closed dumb fucks Georgia, Texas, Florida, California etc taken steps took here.

Other states part national shutdown include Massachusetts, Vermont, every state managed pandemic stopped increase new cases. 

But support shutting travel states uncontrolled spread coronavirus. taken steps NY took problem right (at least, would manageable)

If sort national leadership policy, directed by, say, US President took his/her job seriously coordinated effort... take business license that‚Äôll fun Methinks mask acne might something severe. Now, hate guy, name virus originated naturally screws someone much. thing invade lungs, digestive tract, certainly invades nerve cells stays hidden within them, gives complications one really understands basically reduces people shadow existance. Add first outbreak near lab out-of-proportion measures Chinese fought virus like welding doors shut. Thank you, governor. way get better grip goddamned mess.

Insane 18 started college... recently deal family member contracted covid-19, want anymore POTUS even started wearing mask (finally). quote that's caused whole hoax mentality first place! Would interesting know nature previous vaccine failures. effective cause side effects? know anything subject idea quickly developed vaccine using different means normal (moths) scares  rebuttal. Also, paper linked calculations based assumptions jobs kept (which 90+% economists disagree with

If gonna post statistics, cite source.

Also, paper state refute heritage foundation claims, quote linked refute **the vast majority workers teenage part-time workers; rather, least 20 years old, half work full time, many struggling support Like bad talking? Like Florida averaging 20k new cases day something? More? deaths obviously look study well, main analysis multivariate logistic regression, estimates effect variable independently. basically results show effect obesity studied outcomes (admission ICU, death), independently factors. Someone who's obese, smokes diabetes even higher risk. wonder, new mutation shows up, call ""American flu."" Well fair......Alabama exactly bastion intellectualism. hear that, Missouri? Get it. totally agree. case hell time loosing weight, find insulin resistant. got control could eat calories right kinds food lose weight before. another weeks he‚Äôll say learned masks help slow infection. weird response. Clearly issue country people believing virus real (which causing people take necessary precautions mitigate spread) yet going mock people using platform inform others...especially southern state? Why? mindset appears ""Sweden badly before, Sweden's gotta bad always"". Usually can. they're sorta ineffective/mono functional comes sars 2 infection. want see bill. 'Murica!!!! I'm expert know anything best guess would 2021 end 2020 we're super lucky. I'm sure first approved emergency use, at-risk individuals makes way average citizen. Production distribution monumental task. u/undeleteparent worry, soon reporting all, basically cure problem Oh see. Yes you‚Äôre right lot optimism article vaccine hasn‚Äôt started phase 1 trials yet. Still successful likely produced much less 2 years. Either look great early trials rushed production won‚Äôt we‚Äôll move candidates.

I strongly disagree though vaccines rushed much. cut short mainly obstacles like pre-clinical development time, vaccine production time, early stage trials participants anyway, delays designing trials. 

The CDC says virus 0.5-0.8% IFR. also much larger hospitalization rate it‚Äôs becoming clear long-term complications real many people. vaccine anything like covid terms risk (and would know phase 3 trials done several thousand even tens thousands people), absolutely way approved many candidates pipeline. 

Yes know people lower risk virus, would include me, couldn‚Äôt care less. vaccine comes I‚Äôm taking look trial results long look clear it‚Äôs recommended doctors I‚Äôm taking would complete disregard others. would say could enforceable one security guard front store one inside store, requiring customers wear mask entering shopping. Yeah ignore Moderna, Pfizer, Inovio, Novavax, Regeneron, J&amp;J, Merck, Bill Melinda Gates Foundation, $10B budget operation warp speed. 

And that‚Äôs even counting companies back progress. worse US across western countries steady rise right-wing populism. think, hope, dying kicks generation can't cope the, often, radical changes world undergoing. generation moves on, things go smoother.

At least hope. 

Our generations count lot less racist homophobic people generations us least. Iowa broke records today also!  Go pro Trump Governors! think they‚Äôre going need banned little longer that. good optimistic. dont even understand cant breathe them. time ever issue im breathing really heavy cloth get sucked onto nose/mouth. breathe normally gently big deal all, especially common surgical masks easiest breathe experience.

They're bunch lazy, entitled drama queens wearing nose chins. Probably less plateau.

Once eliminate indoor dining bars, spread coming essential worker jobs residences (both inside families home social gatherings). isn‚Äôt much political attack meaningful way, you‚Äôre pretty much stuck dude whole series. commonality: insurance provider reply budge absurd amount PR gets wind it. segment every month, millions Americans medical debt leading bankruptcy prefer term ‚Äúmaskholes‚Äù stopped going local Target. person store wearing mask harassed multiple times customers. store though, drove 30 minutes next nearest one, fine. already masks. sell masks Target.

The training involved wearing mask handing mask person mostly self evident take weeks.

I'm sure anyone works Target bitched customers enough know handle well.

Any excuses? pays increase day care workers wage? Oh that's right do. Better work longer hours. idiots never understand can't give things people. comes somewhere, eventually everybody pays. Tragically, must agree. I've Florida resident 50 years, I've never ashamed actions fellow residents state's government. morning awaken worsening numbers; day feels surreal staring headlights oncoming train, yet even trying get tracks. hate this. Fresh league, breaking everyone's ankles.. mean lungs. says article supplies brought ship, right. Sometimes use different time zones day, 24 hours. Sometimes use deaths reported regardless deaths occurred. CVS can't even get *own* employees wear masks. wife went pick prescription day single pharmacy tech wearing masks, were, wearing improperly. family flying vacation August bringing friends multiple areas country together. went ahead broke quarantine they'll ""be flying anyway, reason quarantine point"".

Dumb. As. Fuck. shouldn‚Äôt shocking. first act administration use ‚Äúalternative facts‚Äù say high attendance Trump‚Äôs swearing-in ceremony. recovery? even finished falling yet. know rough right now, worst still come, reckless fantasy think anything get better virus either dealt with, run course, neither seems imminent. Odds full NFL season - less 50/50. could afford still potentially spreading virus someone home well personally feel research potential vaccine open source anyway. 

Most leaders saying life return 'the new normal' vaccine, would think freely sharing information many scientists possible would best approach anyway. 

But guess important protecting patents $$$. Trump needed one dumber dosent look like idiot. going one bumpy ride. Buckle look cases deaths see they're right now, look hospitalizations (they're lagging indicator deaths). 

In L.A. County we'll seeing deaths catch Spaniard here

You requiring masks already?

Here they're required everywhere there's fine wearing one outside - even maintain social distances (there exceptions course)  told us back 2004: new talking point? missed memo  air conditioning? Personally, think challenge trial takes place phase III well underway areas high community spread makes ton sense , concern seemed labs access virus first place. think important remember labs already culture virus necessary access virus order research it. Good thing scientists say kids go back school

Not smart I‚Äôm going use analogy. Thank you. ever spent time Florida talked people there, know answer question. tell (anecdotally) this, every experience education, public, private, online public, online private, traditional homeschool (military fam). boys challenged short attention spans. Although online loads challenges department, first child rocked connections academy online public‚Äîvery streamlined program. year worried senseless‚Äîhe passed state exams flying colors. son, private school, told ready second grade. held back (plus ‚Äúlate‚Äù birthday) repeated first grade different private school‚Äîhe well peers. Every experience unique dependent many different factors one thrived struggled them. also tell traditional homeschoolers outperform public counterparts every measurable academic level. SATs, state required exams, etc. (not saying every parent capable online learning would yield result, parents capable desire) think problem inherently online learning homeschooling, think parent‚Äôs ability desire (nothing wrong that) put level effort takes achieve desired results. confirm, parents support online learning almost level full homeschooling‚Äîwhich commitment education, lifestyle. extremely daunting creates whole new dynamic involved. left homeschooling behind, became struggle, school setting equal, different challenges. saying is, kids individuals family completely unique. see online presents ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù problem, really escape nomatter rn. boil safety, get answer‚Äîthat comes set challenges. think focus going overcome set challenges interim, kids parents alike come better side. Yeah, even statewide indoor mask order state governor, last time Walmart 50/50.

Which, fair, drastic improvement statewide mandate. Thanks, nice. Online learning horrible, disagreement there. Teachers stupid, know hate hate it. fact go far say teacher claims like online school bad teacher person school. 

 But, ready sit 45 90 minute class leave seat, group work, labs science classes, chorus band, indoor PE, teacher allowed within 6 ft safety, everyone wears mask 7 hours day, afraid people look sick might coronavirus, teacher school everyone afraid teacher might coronavirus gave them, fear come outbreaks schools. list goes on.

When looking next year comparing online school pre-coronavirus school. comparing online school new normal. week, room.

Jared new ""database"" thing, give chance, future *reported* deaths SHALL lower. 

Not sarcastic.  Ok, they'll behind maths. Big deal.

A bigger deal behind English imo, due way math builds itself. know culture problem math, important everything personal finance, decision-making problem solving, estimating, knowing difference billion trillion politicians throw around, etc. 

Anyhow, really dislike anti-math sentiment, said: Math distance tutoring option. That's factually mortality rate is, though...

Mortality rate deaths/cases, resulting presuming lot man. Actually, like trump trust either. Neither anarchist, I'm actually liberatarian. believe government necessary, though always questioned never impede personal freedoms given nature reason. 
Now points:
- said possible flawed vaccine. 
- dont hate fauci gates, know fauci gates' true intentions, neither you. go example bill gates' charity work, maybe betterment mankind, maybe purely public relations power gives; perhaps profited charitable acts. knows. 
- implying cov19 doesnt exists, implying possibly over-blown establishment media, consequences economically psychologically heavily outweigh effects virus gone.

Im Noone another person another perspective. Thanks arguement. things effect us argued debated. Please stay tuned tomorrow ""How fucked we?"". Thank much. Good night! Yes, depends though. Still tons great desolate areas. hacked several hospitals worst pandemic Europe. even sure trying anymore... looks uglier every time hear speak Democrats. would never act way detrimental greater good Since start July numbers drastically risen. They've adding like 10k cases day recently. Since start July they've added 150k cases alone. Things might get real ugly weeks lag deaths catches reaching, people backseat buckle risk injuring people front seat accident. exactly. inflammatory phase probably similar ""waves"" symptoms adults report. typically comes exertion, triggers inflammation.

Kids kids though, stop they're easily adults will, might making worse. they're fun, they'll ignore warning signs. May mean parents get recovering kids stay calmer while.

I remember flu 5. miserable, pissed allowed play. vivid memory hopping around little mermaid sleeping bag told stay bed decided counted ""bed"". adult, moving last thing wanted flu. district basically gave us 3 options. Option 1 go person offer person. Option 2 virtual learning full time home. option 3 leave current school online learning always like kids cancer pregnant teens etc. 

If choose option 3 can't sports activities school anymore lose spot magnet school (one sons goes magnet school) . 

So chose option 1 like 7 hours day virtually option 2 said. Option 3 probably less time would lose spot school can't school sponsored activities. Haha. No, advocating all. dichotomy. post started chain comments suggesting paying parents stay home due lost income. objected subsequent others objected position.

Kids stay home parents school year. School online fulfilling successful person classes, it. least kids parents still alive resolve time future. definitely last. look handled first shutdown. I've noticed major difference individual Target stores. one closest worse Walmart. nothing carts, even thing wipes carts, hand sanitizer out, even employees wearing masks. Target next city stuff mentioned wore masks. like driving 30 minutes next Target stopped going Target. thought going everywhere already. NJ standard practice stores everywhere since corona started. important people able fully understand dangerous 
And actively sought cases found ... also need understand context data. 
At beginning focused testing sick limited testing ability testing capability able expand wider population. cases less serious (As data countries suggests) still seeing level seriousness increase cases *""you chosen... death...""*

-President Saruman anyone link fundraiser? Sadly correct. thought issue data goes intermediaries first ""it taken website"" Makes wonder many patients covid lab-confirmed. Aldi's require masks? getting groceries thru Instacart assumed wore masks store employees wore masks. Theres smart motherfuckers ones trip individuals interviewed Trump rallies, without mask, tell reporters they're immunecompromised. flat nuts. Seriously, people like North Korean citizens. deep narrative even wanted rescue them, able to. There's enough time able get them. De-programming long process. people willingly admit spot wrong. going little virus transmitter fans blowing virus every perceived safe home soon.....

Im telling you, get point keeping schools closed, cost opening gonna set costs.......and would hate see children end orphans result.....or child lose parent this.....for matter problem height, length - ideally it'd inch two longer stretch ear ear. 

Still, clear, wear anyways I'm fucking dumbass. comfortable. husband mild symptoms since Monday. went urgent care tested day. Told results would back 3-5 days. called today see update telling takes 14 days go free testing event today can't go work. working home getting worse far 14 days long time results. taking kids hiking weekends get house we're back self isolating get results. left much still. FUCK MARCH!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!!?!?!??! Blood. Blood word looking for. additional numbers testing make Trump look bad?  saw coming, vent. Sure, deadlier viruses there, really need outright kill enemy virus. need a) longer asymptomatic period (check) longer period people already infectious (check), variety symptoms disease hard diagnose field (check) crippling / killing infected (not fully check... yet). imagine particular virus studied carrier RNA another virus strain. Economists said this. easy slam NYC. survived virus insurmountable odds providing compassion help others.  makes America great, red-hat version America 90% people better dead. Yeah, that‚Äôs true. we‚Äôre human sometimes fuck up. 
I hate Trump much next person, plenty reasons hate treasonous lying racist asshole, seems like sensationalist news throw shade. want news agency honest intent what‚Äôs said.
Did watch video?
It‚Äôs &lt;60 seconds. 
Did misinterpret? Honestly sometimes first responder needs yell loud enough heard. Beyond medics firefighters already wear masks, police departments need craft ""unless yelling"" policy IMO. really want see happens vacationers come back north. there's another spike, I'm going fucking pissed. vaccines better fucking come end year. Uh little dance saying FL would next NY. Guess what, we're WORSE fault.
The best thing FL resign immediately. Trump think red zone means heavily republican. guarantee it. Ah, by.... well entire US lol

Still, think important bit (D) next governor‚Äôs name probably. Reasoned debate work people. anything made sense way are. retailers wait Wal-Mart everything first. dont want risk losing customers Wal-Mart.

I guess like standing out. - companies say 

‚Äúok, well that‚Äôs unfortunate - however give us list credit card happy shop you‚Äù.

I'm 2008 so, got first job cashier Harris Teeter. offered college tuition programs 401k contribution matching starting almost immediately working there, among things. also paid better grocery stores, deli/florist/bakery people making $20/hr 401lk matching. Essentially, living wage future. later needed temp job time bought out, guess - offer shit pay slashed everyone.

I‚Äôm saying people can‚Äôt get symptoms twice, saying one 99.9% sure gain resistance reinfection done virus, least short term. Karens hoarding toilet paper pasta two weeks now. I‚Äôm amazed many willing wear masks. I‚Äôve heard many excuses wearing masks. There‚Äôs way reason deniers. (That includes who‚Äôve already lost someone close.) breathe mask. Well OK, probably like 8 10 weeks.  pretty sure washington‚Äôs numbers screwed bc reporting cases days late. One day it‚Äôll 1,200 new cases bc lack behind next 400 one day part gets terrifying everyday. still 6 months hope national response. also know even Biden gets 500 electoral votes, fraud screamed lawsuits challenge legitimacy. worst part. potus defeated via vote courts, still control weapons, money, desperate militia morons voted him. fear next 6 months undoing virus biggest threat. Get ready, people, enjoyed best part 2020. worst coming. Brace science matter school, fuck taught? ""Ignorance strength""? Savage. Trump‚Äôs previous hatred expressed disabled people indicator hate agree, do. coworker trying tell percent positive tests higher bc we're testing more. tried explain differently stress percentage part still replied, ""uh, yeah. They're testing people, percentage positive tests higher."" live Florida, btw. copy Walgreens policy selling alcohol. Walgreens quietly reversed policy sells alcohol cigarettes. Propaganda downplay crisis. it‚Äôs real unless happens someone family. uncle good sure caught Laughlin. Totally irresponsible gov opening country right now. Rofl fuck even mean [‚ÄúHello, hookworms, get  really wish would actually try enforce masks distancing.
There (no lie) 10% customers come wearing masks.
I've also noticed ones wear masks, even flimsy ""better nothing"" type masks, always break social distancing help out. Like right me.
But obviously CEO/corporate really care, brought issue time time again.

What I'd REALLY love know store managers company wide told tell covid positive employees can't tell employees post social media. store manager. :(  sad fact virus likely affect poorer demographics probably vote Republican anyway. I‚Äôm 30 husband 31, take seriously mask up. Thankfully, people state masking up, rare see way older...so, young people. Walmart West Des Moines, IA 3 associates outside asking people put masks went in. 

While outside coming everyone seemed comply already. inside produce area near doors saw least dozen people push masks immediately super useful chin protection. let dangle one ear. 

One lady gave impressed face saw looking her. mean staring made point stare back like itd make feel bad.

No one said anything person without mask front checkout. areas 'with' mask mandates stores enforcing orders corporate. accept wrong move on. okay recognize mistake correct it. calculate mortality rate population. population (you choose) differs depending calculating. CFR population known cases. IFR population actual infections. CMR (Crude Mortality Rate) population whole, or, since talking COVID specifically, could say Cause-specific death rate. I, article, referenced CMR/CSR (Obviously). Scroll wikipedia article see clearly...

To see point stubborn ignorance. alright wrong- changed statement mortality simplicity.

Again- word choice imitation title anyway literary appeal.

&amp;#x200B;

"" Measures mortality ...

Cause-specific death rate: Number deaths assigned specific given time interval divided mid-interval fatality (CFR): proportion diagnosed cases particular [medical lead fatality rate (IFR): proportion infected cases particular [medical lead death. Similar CFR, adjusted asymptomatic undiagnosed ""

Edit: could simply look sentence \*immediately following sentence quoted me\*

Shorewood, Wisconsin, mask mandate ends January 20, 2021, President gets inaugurated. mask mandate city Milwaukee ends November 4, day vote President. Ironic didn‚Äôt even bother think pick different dates. since it‚Äôs mandate, it‚Äôs legally enforceable point levying fines anyone non-compliance. relative cop said fine anyone complying. it‚Äôs also funny numbers keep getting higher confirmed cases. Yet, amount people get tested decreased. happen?! think media misrepresenting numbers intentionally inflating them. test procreate that‚Äôs case it‚Äôs still fault listening every expert said ‚Äúheat isn‚Äôt going slow down‚Äù. Same. want believe. Perhaps lack leadership. understand Georgia republican governor (and yes blame republican governance debacle) decreed people need wear masks despite local municipalities counties issuing mask requirements. know republicans feel people crossing borders use services I'm guessing long southern neighbors stop taking free loading Georgians. school quite literally safe space.

School still now. best school means abuse neglect discovered. kids cameras right homes hours time think still go on, schools can't never could fix problem abusive homes, terrible neglectful parents, abject poverty. issues need addressed source. offer restrictive guidance needs ICU beds refuse. Boom, people pass away ""unknown pneumonia."" Thank you. Mine cases, test positivity, though heard positivity near 20% state‚Äôs capital city. They'll filled soon. Time bring ice-cream trucks. He‚Äôs gaslighting like rest dumb fucks. Russia's whole approach foreign policy zero sum. What's bad others good them. want us respond poorly possible COVID, they're pushing anti-mask, anti-quarantine, anti science propaganda. since US gambling vaccine, best thing could damage us sabotage vaccine efforts Everything administration reverse engineered. Cotton swaps test contain micro antennas, careful work telecommunications literally track who've covid test thanks 5g. Bill gates says /s Shirts shoes? dont think get bad. Lol. misleading. direct quote following sentence(s) make better. want wear fucking mask? came couple days later saying must done safely. Communists makes things criminal, criminal. goddamit morty, hell whit portal gun?!?!?!?? There's always reason people dismiss truth. 

""The experts touch normal people's needs""

""They're different generation that's touch. ""

""They'll see things differently they've raised family""

""They qualified speak subject"" yeah everyone shirts use ""better nothing"" mask. wish lot things like japan, unfortunately there's universal culture considerate US CHURCHES. Everyone goes Church. Everyone. also refuse wear masks cause, ""MMUuhhh freEEEDOMZZ"". vote horrible people like Donald Trump. Lots screaming ref projecting action over. happened supplies? still stockpiled? Cases went likely roll back opening bit (indoor dining like), waiting weeks watching numbers. restrictions plus new statewide mask mandate likely drive cases again. don‚Äôt restrictions might necessary.

Most people think disaster rightly so. People fucking pissed. Kemp banned city/county mask mandates. Wow. everyone, except apparently White House filed go public last week (I guess didn‚Äôt want disclose, now, they‚Äôve business). Yes has. Tigers Bronx Zoo caught April infected zookeepers. suspect could end case vaccine virus well. new shot every year whatever popular strain moment grant immunity everyone, make easier overcome. That's enough me. like they'll ffs; they'll hospital trying die. Masks social distancing done everybody lockdown done most. Seem best way dealing covid-19 far. Surely need looking countries got top situation, New Zealand, Germany Japan. It‚Äôs interesting many people I‚Äôve seen recently claim know someone ‚Äúleft testing line‚Äù, later told tested positive. ü§î Ohh yes cause kids dropping dead left right covid.... /S Ah, yes, see understand word ""some"" means.

Their incompetence saves us, again. stick guns least two comments row? First Ai Fen getting ""censored"" medical staff contacted Wuhan CDC informed presence unknown pneumonia. delay genome sequencing basically scientific miracle reported within two weeks. blaming China global pandemic, even though evidence emerging every major continent November? freedom speech? really grasping straws here. foaming mouth yet? ever get tired wrong? even worth entertaining. leaking propagandistic hatred chinese government makes bigot?

Are dumb? literally said ""Go China love much."" Earth going inject criticizing government projecting ""love China"" onto me? words, mine. guess first time can't keep story straight, fourth either. mad getting shot left right.

Cool incivility, buddy. right, ignoring facts, changing subjects, personal attacks. c*mmies anything new?

LOL I'm c*mmie? That's synonymous ""I nothing,"" good see waving white flag. I've given nothing facts. done nothing change subjects ignore facts. Quit projecting. Big brain moves right there. I'm proud American, like people like call anybody disagrees ""c E."" think masks necessary sure trust criteria... sued state attorney General. pandemic hurts bottom line. long goes on, less money spent stores. I've noticed people claiming covid NYC God's judgment conspicuously silent Damn, hot take! medical science ignoring becuase difficult explain.

How know medical science ignoring it? Task force: *reads recommendations* terrible numbers, bet fix make hospitals report directly us instead! state mandate maybe half follow it. Put mask on, walk store, take mask off. dont even that. Pack guys, officially old 35 instead 34! needs slaves lick boots person guess. cant theres stay home slaves infect him. stores enforcing shit. saw lady Walmart arguing door guy masks. went anyway without one shit. people wear get remove soon do. [Flush mean time people getting sick/ infected dying droves begging lockdown. Leadership joke America. Thanks saying this. I'm one people gets $12 hour deal assholes. guess least someone thinks entertainment. might already 10-20% people infected recovered US. percent think 2021? think herd immunity good strategy, rather one US set ensuring everyone gets sick fast possible. Amazon can't find enough people warehouses 15 per hour. That's did. ...crickets Like teachers, also vouch better prepared distance learning March due summer trainings. busiest summer I've ever had! (Not complaining)

Admin school also spent time beefing tech resources online curriculae, among things.

Its governor district board like, ""nah, go school anyway, y'all."" least swedish ppl still jobs don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs good idea. Sounds like need study Israeli school outbreak then. don‚Äôt think virus discriminates nationality. COVID-positive children exposed hundreds children adults, didn‚Äôt seem infect any. won't. right. Might affect ability someone vote (transportation, etc), change anything right vote people charged murder. rail work situation. Look carnage percent population infected. scale numbers equate 70% population. already hospital beds. think look like 70% population infected? Complete utter Hell Earth dead dying strewn place place put them, one take nobody left take away. want see shit show? Try getting 70% guarantee see things feed nightmares eternity. article wasnt even Li Wenliang, bother read spewing propaganda? hospital official WuHan health commission forbade Ai Fen speaking found, even family. that, multiple doctors, including Li Wenliang died.

A government silence doctors journalists reporting pandemic transparent data. Nice joke. Genetics loads gun, lifestyle pulls trigger.

The lifetime incident rate type 2 diabetes 5% normal BMI. increases longer obese, someone obese entire adult life (from 18 onwards) 70% chance developing type 2 diabetes point. people eaten immobile normal blood sugar, marathoners wind needing count carbs. roll dice, hand D20 roll ""for diabetes"", I'd rather get 1 anything 14.

Pretty much everything regards health matter stacking odds favor. can't guarantee avoid contracting COVID survive do, improve odds wearing mask, socially distancing, shape, eating well, ensuring get enough vitamin (either direct sunlight via supplements), etc. ""If penis 6"" longer would long"". need build memorial people.

Except they're Yeah same, I‚Äôm Chicago things basically normal except everyone wears masks indoors don‚Äôt tolerate Karens protesting them. 

The thing sucks pleasant outdoor dining season short, there‚Äôs going hard choices leaders starts getting cold again.

Since Oxford head start basically recycling methods cov1, got skip bunch optimization experiments hurdle forward. idiots love using vehicles weapons. Like terrorists. happening don‚Äôt mind asking? Re-openings or? cant trust countries. might give free kidding. need american pharmaceuticals charge everyone left nut and/or clit thing. Otherwise point? brilliant! basically, let die. theres point patient surviving!? lol

cringe Gotta pay back loans. always buddy, can't tell true. Likely ""buddy"" Fox News... even Fox News says real, people get back ""Life"". Excess deaths also higher undiagnosed coronavirus infections. lower reduced car accidents improved air quality.  Pandemic tip scale ways. Plague Inc vibes imagine Monday, Walmart require customers wear masks. Someone said immunity virus lasts short amount time got upvoted, missing something new reports suggesting otherwise (immunity could last while) ?  That's one worst thing this...finding many people stubborn/ignorant/scared right thing.  wonder cultural impacts too: normal socially accepted Asian countries wear facemask sick maybe prefer wear one? US, example, people go work sick cough place. Good luck getting wear mask too.  antimaskers move ordering Amazon. bezos rich enough Yeah, interesting watch opinion corridor shift last months. First became ok say ""elder care well"" one say ""we failed protect elders"" backlash. one *can't* go say ""we inappropriately triaged them"" yet. 

The mask thing also become acceptable point complaint SVT ran quite good documentary problem: don‚Äôt think death toll would‚Äôve looked different lockdown April. 

Disagree though, think lockdown would helped lot even came late. example gathering restrictions come place?

for 50, way late: March 29. Also never went 10, Nordics did. now, mine relatives. Grandparents come pick little one 7, drop older one sister‚Äôs way work. can‚Äôt leave burden family much longer. in-laws old tired, they‚Äôre sharp used be, especially stay top young children day. sister stressed. She‚Äôs sweet tell face tell she‚Äôs getting tired it. that‚Äôs colleagues well. kids staying family guise it‚Äôs temporary. So, interesting bring gaining weight pregnancy. 

We naturally become insulin resistant pregnant store fat it‚Äôs needed. baby born, insulin resistance resolved things go back normal. 

Changes hormones affected weight.

The point I‚Äôm making people hormonal issues driving weight retention, making difficult lose weight. Similar might‚Äôve gotten pregnancy. 

Calories crucial. they‚Äôre whole story. I‚Äôm glad calorie restriction alone worked you. others may underlying metabolic dysfunction. finding more.

Calories still crucial‚Äîas said. that‚Äôs whole story calorie restriction alone may work. see going up, unless people really buckle wear masks plus socially distance. college sticking online lectures now, know high schools going teach. Never gamble Florida Man death line... Unfortunately morons don‚Äôt covid. wish did. Nothing prove people covid real unless get it. 

Not stupidity virus, would virus makes people infected think smart yeah. Don‚Äôt yuck yum Ouch. ...crickets You‚Äôd generally know it. It‚Äôs headache hangs around days weeks.  way happened Paraguay, dragging dead bodies street dumping them. yeah China, US. US id agree you, actually wore masks quarantined told to, get ""freedoms"" do. It‚Äôs either you‚Äôre scared life everyone around you‚Äôre taking necessary precautions things make others safe.

Or you‚Äôre opposite, downplaying even making fun opposing group things going ‚Äúliving life‚Äù. isn‚Äôt between, it‚Äôs literally divide. someone like whose former, friends family latter I‚Äôm practically alone situation.

Also family planning moving less liberal state souly fact think democrats causing problems moving different state gong fix everything.

I feel like I‚Äôm taking crazy pills it‚Äôs fun. tests still backdated? Target still enforcing it. Insanity matter perspective. way we're insane people seeking sanity... Arkansas so.. get Darwin award, get Darwin award...! republican, tell. screwed Feds lets states use private labs early March. forced CDC every test country, could like 100 day. huge spikes testing occurred Fed let governors in-state. think shutdowns pretty quick that. would rather toss whole year start next year half ass year. son properly learn Algebra 1 year, going lost math rest high school career. can't make things, built upon built upon Banning cities state enforcing face mask orders criminally negligent insane. governor either needs psych eval prison. Wait, mean Florida 20% US new infected cases? Divoc president emergency powers nothing short astonishing. absolutely could declare state emergency put national mask mandate. kinds powers president unilaterally things actually frightening simply declares going use them. never used place. would pay parents take care children? used say thing started running 3 months ago steadily losing weight since eating same. me, running works.

On hand, find strength training (when used years ago) makes hungrier point compensates calorie expenditures exercise. Well, we've asked use contactless payments UK much possible. really see problem using cash though, barely ever use days anyway. Add healthcare workers getting sick got good shitstorm brewing. bet it‚Äôs going yuge! /s fact (Swedish Govt) assumes herd immunity possible without basis crime people. would think tell women bodies assume. new kind zombie, type bite, infects others breath. screams others use mask hopes infecting person. gets easier stop pretending we're nation freedom even countries. sure derived comment I'm guessing bc miserable shit blames capitalism fault every person Earth. Work anyone else. This, one right 140,000 died thousands die too. Omegaloool Rest Power, Isabelle, hopefully peace we've beaten shit.  Really convinced Russia somehow behind all, exploiting weaknesses country using Trump puppet... also feel idiotic thinking really understand Russia's motivation would be, maybe someone fill blanks tell that's absurd? Need get Winn Dixie board next  Wait, freedom shop naked Walgreens? wonderful news. Finally store respects freedom pick prescriptions Christmas displaying winter bush. 

S/ obviously. ""Historically"" God done lot that... don't. I'm spending good portion summer researching ways improve distance learning and/or uploading existing material. I'm sure I'll glad spent time preparing, definitely small undertaking. stinks I'm missing time daughter sake people's kids. Chuck Norris Reopening wild Paris, basically rules anymore. Bars packed, scary. surprise Canada Mexico contribute help Trump build wall. national interests keep Americans America. heart bleeds parents take care children. like, government force cover genitals public....

Oh yea, can. anyone able get tested Florida easily? Seems like CVS locations appointments I'm seeing park locations closed. Money. come stay home can't work? Neat, thanks r/publicfreakout drooling anticipation Lots people already working home. School older pupils already remote teaching school youngest (pre school) open summer. grasping here... even end day yet. I'm Texas.  feel way. Right. Hence it‚Äôs problematic, can‚Äôt fault much. *The* costume. everyone dressed  linking Vice make case better lol common exactly long term conditions people seem increasingly concerned about?  haven‚Äôt. makes sense asshole like care deeply stock portfolio ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù people‚Äôs lives. 50% Americans care it‚Äôs perfectly normal ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø *rarely* transmit it. French study, boy Covid-19 exposed 80 classmates three schools disease. None contracted it. Transmission respiratory diseases, including influenza transmission, common study New South Wales, nine infected students nine staff across 15 schools exposed total 735 students 128 staff Covid-19. two secondary infections resulted, one transmitted adult data striking,"" said Dr. Raszka. ""The key takeaway children driving pandemic. six months, wealth accumulating data showing children less likely become infected seem less infectious; congregating adults following safety protocols responsible driving upward curve."" Every retailer customers. Target insists ""guests."" Math irrelevant without context, majority LA County like deserts, mountains &amp; national parks Seeing people see masks huge threat freedom, imagine push back educational videos + lockdown would get? Basically china re-education camps. know thought way. bad good show 80's called Love Connection, show funny asf yep. going toss special needs kids wolves virtual learning shit. need aides therapists therapies person instruction. He‚Äôs killing constituents. wants make folks urban afraid vote 2020. Protecting kids, parents teachers becoming infected deadly disease good option. fact inconvenient parents take care children change fact. nice! basically three possible paths:

1. Mask orders, enforcement, reduce transmission R0&lt;1.
2. Shutdown orders, enforcement, reduce transmission R0&lt;1.
3. Lots dead bodies, permanent disabilities, otherwise.

The governors refuse issue mask orders, also refuse issue shutdown orders. So, Plan B seems be: ""Lots dead bodies."" absolutely COVID test negative, based many, many factors. One viral load time swab. start tail end infection still test negative (or even somewhere between, sometimes). I‚Äôve patients test positive, negative, positive again. 


And account user error. Lab techs, nurses, doctors, phlebotomy techs‚Ä¶ none perfect. I‚Äôve seen heard plenty stories people swabbed incorrectly stresses what‚Äôs point don‚Äôt even perform test accurately?


And reality, negative test doesn‚Äôt mean squat. means don‚Äôt detectable level virus nasopharynx exact moment swab shoved back there. EVEN someone test negative, could easily ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù, yet still died damage virus wreaked body could simply contracted *after* test. longer you‚Äôre hospitalized reason, likely you‚Äôll contract infectious disease simply place keep people infectious diseases. Standard precautions, contact isolation, droplet isolation, reverse isolation, airborne isolation fantastic procedures place keep people passing around much possible, they‚Äôre fail proof. Viruses designed spread one extremely effective job. let‚Äôs forget turnaround vast majority tests 1-2 days. Imagine amount pathogens someone hospital comes contact amount time. It‚Äôs staggering. positive test means it. negative test means don‚Äôt don‚Äôt anymore didn‚Äôt high enough level body right haven‚Äôt gotten *yet*, basically means jack shit. 





Long story, short: manager clue talking about, jumped conclusion based little information poor education virus disease transmission general, sounds like. hoping nation requires mask everywhere, period. let virus die maybe go back type normalcy one give would bet :/  Also kid comes back positive quarantined, what‚Äôs plan parents kids place? Without formal rules guidelines doubt people get extra time off, someone stay home kids...and could 2-3 weeks multiple times semester (esp test every time kid respiratory signs fever like would adults) gonna lie, rather pathetic look Target Walmart did. üíØ Canada don‚Äôt want us Oh boy go dont windows way create ventilation fresh air honestly I'd start getting used wearing n95's. could take breaks classes alleviate pressure helpful. theyre unqualified fucks point. GODDAMN NOVEMBER CANNOT COME FAST ENOUGH Last month ‚ÄúR‚Äù good go hookworm thing. change bit... option single parents households parents work. Resign already, one thing Florida. forget beginning, federal govt actively confiscating supplies states.  odds? go far towards communism may trials. liberating scientific research vaccine global pandemic locked down... wow, threat world!

the people locking threat world here. disagreement there, state problem, need shut down.

The issue states problem got ignorant Republican politicians downplaying epidemic hiding actual numbers infections/hospitalizations/deaths/etc.

and lines days tests, time President task force rise occasion.

Some Republican governors actually handing like adults (Maryland, example), unfortunately citizens states like Florida Texas Arizona Georgia leaders emulate Trump. disgustingly bloated military would good start. cut services get rich pay fair share change. 14 members cabinet somehow media blame.

i guess degree harvard mean much used to. sad. anyone fb group dr. Franks models? claims he‚Äôs scientist seems heavily false positives, anti mask narrative things people seriously falling it. He‚Äôs based Ohio reports ‚Äúdata‚Äù states. 

Just curious anyone thinks models. Two reps threatened write law requiring hospitals send data CDC. scared them. someone TN, say presidential supporters give ‚Äúfreedom.‚Äù Awesome. Thank you!

Just filled survey submitted. hope contact me. Still better NY. people saying ""just wait 2 weeks"" Florida literally months now. NY disastrously one really talks Yeah ethical issues recruiting healthy young men prime go fight wars ""gloriously"" die battle country. no-one bats eye.

I personally think people misinformed possible consequences challenge trial fine. also good news. Currently, shits starting overcrowd dining room table. conveyor belt would move way nicely. Kids spread it. School fine. better drink Clorox sure probably closer 5% feels like 30. 5 sway another 25+ may followers 35 well describes friends too.

Though looked case curves broken age several states and, least those, massive spike cases 20-29 range. wonder whipped dick out? Flipping patients (keeps bad shit settling one part lungs) helped. 

An interesting simple example doctors learning fight Covid. Well, questioning Fauci licking ass? recently started recommending wearing masks? Sorry, buy latest excuse supply issues healthcare workers. Average people even wear surgical masks. Cloth masks made tshirt private citizens business stepped in. 'two weeks flattened curve' turned months lockdowns economic disaster?

Fauci incompetent fool, election optics preventing getting fired. Watch happen election, matter win ass get fired. I'm sure Royal Botanical Gardens going want hookworms worth shot! county option full time, half person half online, full online. Rip everyone anything full online lot people know miss friends school :| Wtf seriously? 

Guess Darwin's gotta Darwin somehow... close zero cases live (eu), despite two hotbeds close us since march. can't remember seeing anyone without mask store. Like, I'd go back February/March. Instead calling heroes applaud actually something ? 

First small things like making sure work get parking tickets bigger things like making sure families taken care thousand health care workers died job. What's funny. lived 45 minutes Manhattan. live 30 outside Tampa. Called friends north ""yeah gov New York stopped playing games. called gov jersey, Connecticut, mass, took stand everyone board""
Meanwhile asshat like ""meh...school Disney everybody!"" 
What fucking joke. people STILL understanding severe is. point them. 100% stupid. data proves wrong every step way observational study (out Henry Ford) downplayed fact HCQ cohort also given corticosteroids small percentage non HCQ given them. Yes, know corticosteroids work. late morbidly obese tell would die son proper education thank much.

There zero percent chance ever gets adults family die COVID-19. FYI district requiring masks masks work good issue.

Good luck getting special needs children (or children except germophobic matter) constantly vigilant surprised post removed hate speech bigotry towards disabled children.............

Facts inconvenient constitute hate speech bigotry. going happen. Federal government can't it, state much unrealistic thing never happen rationale avoid mask usage. everyone's safety, sick fucking game control playing out. virus gonna bigly. Gonna YUGE. grab virus mitochondria Half million already much number American soldiers died World Wars combined. anti-mask flash mobs

Coronavirus-laced water cannons go brrrr Seriously, STAY HOME, STAY SAFE. damn hard this. See Donald transparent president ever. Obama anything like huh? I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve thought this, maybe offer pay delivery service one available area? get this.. Legit question. January, nation wide mask shortage. Hopefully we‚Äôll learn (lol) good stock hand next time, hopefully adopt practices similar Japan wearing mask sick socially expected. Agreed. certainly form self-selection bias. wish windows! classroom middle school any. planning using surgical mask cloth mask over. fuck Kemp. noticed trump coward faced tough questions often scarred call people person trashes Twitter. also robust medical system cities. Rural hospitals easily overrun. It‚Äôs simple cities bad, countryside good. obviously  think you‚Äôre right. help poor fella? exactly what's going even now. People making shit suddenly they're ""exempted"". company fight medical excuse. get hopes up, people think virus hoax continue affect personally. guys fucking retarded. rest country going wall us off. There‚Äôs many idiots. also take shit one conveyor belts wish, per constitution plant based manufacturing thing might kill it. It‚Äôs supposedly hard scale quickly. Kind like parents religion. fall back choose specific, convenient parts support whatever contention point insist making causes ruckus family. Funny feel need fall back religion (my parents far orthodox-type worshippers) storm self-made family crisis conflict cannot resolve issue without citing religious shit. course they'd never admit that. people works, majority fat people. Nutrition Weight Management class college, read study said helpful 25% fat people, rest makes feel behave worse. may never seen (it's 9 years old point). famous conservative tv personality said air nobody explain tides That's weird statement context compelling reason want share vaccine research countries? always thought Kroger one best grocery chains work for, outside employee-owned HyVee. Kroger workers union $20+ hour King Soopers around Denver? doubt go years.  expect decision announced Jan 20, 2001, new orders issued date. people might arrested federal charges, national guard might busy states. that, recovery begin.

God making bunch third parties suffer teach Satan lesson. reason use coronavirus thats already circulation? Making virus scratch would enormously difficult modifying existing coronavirus behave like SARS-Cov-2 would silly plenty directly relevant human coronavirus hand.

Plenty labs already SARS-Cov-2 samples hand that's need vitro drug studies, studies virus properties stability, use testing neutralization assays. Researchers get cell cultures CDC I'm sure UK similar meta analysis studies arrived single number? Lol. Ok, that's know nonsense. good always quote ‚Äúbuddy‚Äù can‚Äôt show receipts press Depends thought process, honestly. plan hire security guards enforce poor cashier get murdered, makes sense.

If ""give customers time get masks"" that's dumb. set outside cashier selling masks two weeks. you‚Äôre proposing reasonable. Except fact idiots let pandemic get control, charge getting control? like Dunning-Krueger case study.

What happen you‚Äôre county gets control, state takes over. state gets control, FEMA takes over. Boogaloo idiots aside, TX FL lost control situation need federal intervention. need extra federal resources, need federal oversight. Asian ...

Of course did. Yeah agree, trying charitable. I'll shocked regulatory agencies allow it. Even young folks. ethics bit issue. They've making case based mortality alone, I'm sure FDA EMA let fly potential serious side effects. Maybe they'll go Brazil one since ethics bodies SA notoriously lax. we'll see. Thank you. sense finally prevailing. Yeah. American Execeptionalism needs end. Permanently. Kids catching schools according article. sure matters *from whom* getting it.  remember masks/PPE 100%. reduces chance infection; eliminate it. healthcare take risk every day right now. Yeah, that's crazy, global pandemic changes things. Wild.  Omg friend mine told shit. lost respect dude. swiping future reference. Thank you! That's real story. Deepest Condolences Ms. Papadimitriou's Family Friends. actual clinical research inhaling alcohol vapors.

Trump's supporters mix wealthy/affluent lower class. dems middle class well part lower class. seriously suggesting dems wealthy/affluent you? think wealthy affluent would running around protesting weeks end day every day, preaching racial justice 24 hrs day social media standing front lines police shot tear gassed spare time? Mississippi badly. posted second highest daily total cases today, cases trending upward quickly. 

Many hospitals getting slammed, least worst, least funded country. shop Walmart? really happy Pollis. actually puts science common sense ahead politics. happy see local gym open back up. disappointed amount people working without masks on. places, brainer.

Costa Rica. Nice forget Italian death count actually undercount. Aka rules apply Exactly this. dropped nuclear weapons hundreds thousands innocent women children incredibly dubious reasons

If don‚Äôt eat week I‚Äôll safe haven‚Äôt gotten bottom wasn‚Äôt even Oval Office 9/11, deep state conspiracy must run really deep. always pleasure. :-D infringing rights dude lol jk 90% population West mountains, confined, dense area.  drink alcohol sugary sodas... problem love food appetite someone 6'0 I'm height you. fucking love food. suppose that's expected XD like food? consider ""the best""? false. average pre-symptomatic period 5 days. 14 days long end... less 3% cases happen day 11. 

That said, blaming Disney Florida‚Äôs issues still foolish. breakthrough news reporters want say is. Shudders... Tan Suit handing popsicles kids. Nothing see here. think like half people get meal first ordered something comes faster, one hour half later we're ready go, meal finally arrives others. Meanwhile, fucking wait table states order lock extra sprinkle masks so, like us, could control damn virus can't go miserable normal lives they're done. can‚Äôt believe anyone still talking HCQ fair, visitors Florida always think twilight zone episode. got bad though even Floridians think one. funny search name GoFundMe find SILs page trying hire lawyer using MIL. awful person around. lol *His comments came discussion coronavirus mental health Floridians, emphasized negative effects social isolation.*

*DeSantis said effects pandemic reach far beyond who‚Äôve infected.*

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre worried paycheck, you‚Äôre worried kids, you‚Äôre worried family members,‚Äù DeSantis said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs lot anxiety here.‚Äù*

I think people need mental-health help anything DeSantis does, anything pandemic done them.

Having 13k cases day must pretty fucking worrying people Florida. 

People Ontario still freaking cases **100** day.   agree more. proud well PA done. Try ignore anti mask screeching rednecks, can't help morons RemindMe! 2 weeks It‚Äôs ok, Ivanka said they‚Äôll find something new meantime /s governor prohibited use masks

What now? Oh Georgia...  wouldn't. Flying Europe low despite attempts make flying safer. People going travel pandemic regardless ""safe"" try make it. Anyone comparing HIV basically retarded. Yall - also tested positive Covid-19!! Yeah, think research needed def. lean way now. 13,554,477 people know gotten it, 584,124 dead.  7,559,252 recovered, 5,411,101 going end one other. 

But I'm statistician guy. acquaintance decided try baby lockdown decided visit parents Florida found last week. wear masks baffling me. still let Americans drive Alaska? starting GoFundMe raise money lawyer sue $50k GoFundMe set up. dad refuses get tested said""they"" using swabs put virus people. SMH. lot places getting rid hazard pay time too. Wonder why. Took idiots long enough say. Hey people dying. know putting workers danger good idea!! Karen full anxiety attack school board meeting thought kid wear mask school literal end world apparently. lazy people read article, restrictions:
All cinemas must adopt online booking system, check temperature customer, face masks mandatory. addition, capacity restricted 30 per cent, number movies shown reduced half customers allowed eat drink.

But wondering, movie shown cinema. New movies going get lose release now. get face shield prevent mask acne I'm sorry, failed state shit.

I embarrassed guys. That's voting important. Favor educated candidates support Science expect nothing less trust facts reality. get conclusion article? kids worried older relatives. one arguing that. doomers right whole time. saying. No, may better, targeted response new virus due previous exposure less bad viruses. Nordics, ethnic ones, quite stubborn. They‚Äôre also quite entitled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always done way. change?‚Äù weird thing they‚Äôre obedient complying unless change something

But I'm sure always applies since DK, FI, accepted moderate lockdowns *huge* change normalcy. maybe pitched *we need we'll bad trouble* imminent threat over, they're back say re: masks. There's imminent danger drive fast change, old pattern ""ugh no, something new? maybe slightly inconvenient? think so"" returns along (a high degree of) normalcy. 

So yeah: guess without imminent danger, fast cultural change hard. Danish authorities slowly introducing masks rather springing people guess. smart. don‚Äôt think anyone denying triage. think they‚Äôre awaiting results investigation. maybe they‚Äôre denying it. Fair enough.

Yeah many denying still. everyone, mixed. fwiw many critics think investigation crock. I'm convinced myself, we'll see pans out. First tell go fuck herself. 

Then tell create fundraiser see many donations gets. administration started travel bans Middle Eastern nations, going end travel bans us world.

This presidency completely nukes irony meter. Pretty sad target Walmart treating people better president. prepare Public Freakout thread way many viral posts morons arguing this....... Yeah, well people stupid carry blame situation put in. economy still tanking side uncontrollable illness tens thousands deaths. local B&amp;N requiring  Shhh, let continue soothing myself. allergies *horrible* year.

That said: work home, wear mask go grocery store drive-thru, 3/4 family members never leave house. one works outside coworkers still required wear masks. Theoretically we're good. Per capita, it‚Äôs bad FL sad instead president government. Lmdaoooo done good man, dont worry me. ok though? seemed super butthurt nobody liked ""joke"". Yes!!! customer facing workers need pepper spray obviously trained + properly compensated new assignment. can't help feel like anything empty PR point. companies actually cared keeping people safe would've required lot sooner. 

My girlfriend works established, national grocery chain began requiring masks month ago, yet people still regularly ignore rule corporate told employees fight refuse entry anyone wearing mask ""they police enforce rule"". simply 'suggestion' masks *offered* upon entry. folks still enter store without wearing mask choose.

You're dead wrong think companies going actually bar paying customers. spend money, that's important stores public health. argument effectively ""*Bush 9/11*"", except time, Trump cult followers actually responsible death came actions/ inaction. channel making changes matter make difference, best can. Don‚Äôt let someone else‚Äôs poor choices change you. Well clearly mean he? Geez people take anything personally start July 16? someone sort ""no big deal team"" (not big enough warrant lockdowns, big enough decent, support elderly wear fucking mask) actually quite fascinating watch numbers. seem rather large lag deaths cases. I'm fully expecting numbers rise still, wonder people learnt lesson protect elderly, policy nursing homes would be. seems big killer. really not. Nearly every single death Nagasaki civilian. Teenagers though???  vaccine, yes. wearing layer cotton face really bother much? sound extremely entitled. Still need paid living wage full time employment. freedom within Constitution mandating masks pandemic infringe upon? I‚Äôm New Zealand Let try suing. genetic modification planta that's going around now, anyone designed potato grows shape dick. greatest failure date. think they've done shit job.
Michael Flynn wrongly prosecuted. clearly entrapment. read it. I'm sorry feel democrates great thing ever. happen russia, impeachment hacking. muller. democrats can't get shit togather. 
We still medicare all. Obama failed that. 
What lock Corona virus.
Covid19 political. we're certainly lucky president. Disney, granddaughter Disney co-founder Roy Disney, admitted she‚Äôs looking information park operators probably considered making decision reopen parks.

If she‚Äôs looking bank accounts financial projections, she‚Äôs *definitely* looking information park operators considered deciding open parks. Adding one factor, dead heat could come reporting patterns. Florida could barely get first since report statewide numbers early morning. California set reporting pattern; counties set reporting time, report multiple times day, counties officially skip weekend reporting entirely, etc. Positivity rate 20% weeks, zero chance case count high enough reflect reality ground. :( Fucking exactly Capitalism can't make Company swim supposed sink. company deserves bailouts. ""But constitution says can't!""

He'd right leaning conservative European government. Even Bernie Sanders, far left left would center-left politician western nation.

We've gradually moving ""center"" far right far-left every nation calls center. ...why adults? Ironic Belgium know cries work... slightly better article trouble get it. we're dead yet Russia? Actually, that's better thought. would assumed lot go well Karen's Kevin's... Yeah that's I'm saying. We're forced servitude due cost living. Agree strongly sentiments expressed here, non American, FML?  Source? must missed seems policy republicans overrule local ordinances. harped ""small government"" years soon control crush local deviations. happened NC, TX, etc. Internet comment sections usually par super conservative uncle thanksgiving 6 pack. family travel Minnesota often understand people go big box stores all. live rural boonies get non-groceries way cheaper Amazon. families budget 3 months year one income 9 two incomes. Stacking additional months onto unplannable scenario difficult lot folks manage. lack awareness topic shows little understand regular people function society hence, little say due significant gap information.
