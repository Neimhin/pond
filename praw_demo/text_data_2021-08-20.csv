Luckily, still effective Delta variant extent.  heard it‚Äôs fully approved adults, doctors prescribe ‚Äúoff label‚Äù kids. could huge. many doctors know get patients benzos one got hooked I'm first place. fuck doctors?? One NPR podcasts covered reasons people getting vaccinated couple months delay full FDA approval significant portion population (iirc number around 4-6% although recall unvaccinated full population). Hopefully people honest using thought acceptable answer get good surge vaccinations news. Even 3% jump fully vaccinated people also encouraging fellow holdouts would get us lot closer need be. Lol. think know me? Right? 4 million+ dead, waning vaccination effectiveness, multiple experts saying herd immunity even possible, another variant due likely day yet predicting virus burning out? really hope that's happens wager single dollar it. Respectfully, totally different thalidomide. Yes, FDA got right countries clearly not, mean specific, unchanging approval process bulletproof situations. speak entire concept EUA.

The reality school opening everywhere, lack mask mandates, highly transmissible delta variant still ramping up, significant number 12 kids infected delta winter. type situation exactly EUA designed for. like extended trial full approval taking detailed, lengthy steps. ""We"" collectively already failed half generation kids reducing community spread keep protected, EUA least do. Many pediatricians agree.

I heard compelling argument kid allowed take vaccine enough safety data EUA. outcomes disease likelihood infection almost certainly worse vaccine. parents welcome wait.  know would also suck? Getting COVID without health insurance. motivate people think. 

that's motivation needed.. back march first eligible get it. way stopped epidemics. aware polio vaccine stop infection? some, doctor important, power, nothing helping people.  [He's referring   Also like.... One best ways love neighbor protect virulent disease doubt it. Delta's transmissibility means traveling fast conferring level protection people get survive it. Peaks come months apart other. [They're referring FDA trying petition ban  Sort of? they're vaccinated, virus replication going dampened. Oh good it‚Äôs fda approved people get Narrator: people still get vaccinated

Well... FDA gave *emergency approval experimental medication.* I'm running way goalposts!! care votes nothing else.  I'll tell exactly they'll do: say can't trust FDA would give full approval vaccine ""killed many people"" similar bs No? sure hope üòï grew catholic. Nothing catholicism teaches vaccines okay. pope himself, along many bishops said vaccines consistent catholic beliefs encouraged people part get shot. crazy people trying hide behind ""catholicism"" way justify anti vax beliefs. I'm glad see officials church rejecting bullshit even I'm practicing catholic anymore. question myocarditis among young adults situation affecting mRNA vaccines? aren‚Äôt Adenovirus-vector vaccines susceptible yielding issues? Pfizer started process first.  problems *not* vaccine ineffective. effective. mRNA vaccines better flu less 10% worse best vaccines ever developed. developed absurdly quickly without sacrificing safety efficacy.

The problem US people. vaccinated rate terrible, politicians, elected help people (ostensibly) driving disinformation, passing legislation pro-virus, pushing personal choice public good -- undermining basic aspect government. get halfway decent vaccination rate, stop COVID, able get there. Covid simply deadly kids. No, indications Delta deadly. every American child life save vaccines, allocated elsewhere youd save hundreds, maybe thousands. real hard make moral justification. 


Bit old, worst pandemic. 134 deaths (231 7 countries). 
  mom said would, feeling she‚Äôll come new excuse now.  reason makes sense. They've unable prove dangerous means too, like tried emergency schedule 2016, they're trying backdoor WHO. Hopefully shoot completely, remove big list scary dangerous things. guess folks really reap sow, huh?  Funny enough, know dumb, hate admit it. mental backflips avoid it, pointing much impact. people though weak afraid. loud, act tough, say support police matter abusive get, surround guns. Call weak afraid. lose absolute shit, every reaction exactly weak afraid animal would do. Bark, growl, bite, try look big, etc. Animals actually strong unafraid that, lol. fuel conspiracy mindset though. Could backfire  OP, Jesus, calm down.

Here:  RemindMe! 3 Months good *I* it. *other* people it, bad.   demonstrated complete lack understanding vaccines, employment, lawsuits single sentence. Congratulations. weird lots people think laws preemptively stopping crime. Laws mostly used way - they're used add charges fact, usually, sorta rarely, like lot people get away criminal behavior, idea practicality enough deterrent enough people keep society turning wild west. help much incredibly infectious virus, helps little, least little bit repercussions dealt out. sucks, that's pretty much way works. Actually saw article surge happening Delta mutation. delta mutation occurred due lack vaccination and/or unvaccinated people. Whether available subsequently refused. mention, vaccine still keeps least seven fold less likely experience severe sickness leading hospital death. you‚Äôre US, make sure get boosters!  Majority could 6/10. working theory either people petrified enough stay home severe self-restrictions virus exhausted new waves would pretty hyper-local statistically insignificant daily positive count.  someone got 2x doses Moderna, ask Moderna also? thought less thing.  heard correctly believe implied one three kinds wore mask school. I'm vaccinated, 35 yo friend. He's hospital breakthrough infection. Everyone needs treat shit seriously. Yes vaccines help, clearly magical reddit wants be. Hoping booster improves odds again. need cut transmission rates way we'll fucked forever. Sounds exactly like vaccine trial I‚Äôm in!

Seriously though thank kids name science! expecting. soon FDA approves it, view conspiracy, rushed decision. also, people using argument, since much faith FDA? Isn‚Äôt another government program trying control things?? argument makes sense. least honest. Don‚Äôt use FDA cop out. LET'S FUCKING GO theoretically possible fully vaccinated person get long Covid. doctors contend appear significant married Texan..and want divorce. said kids almost certainly picked school school require masks 2 3 children walked around maskless day. That's pretty far making sure exposed virus. 

As got sick despite fully vaccinated, keep mind vaccines 100% effective never said be. think best 94% effective, variants bumped bit more. 94% effective sounds great (and is!) calculate 6% US vaccinated population, see many millions people really get full protection. plenty enough rough breakthrough cases even deaths always going around degree. Aggressively uninformed alternate views perpetually moving goalposts? sounds healthy   currently trying get ban internationally, absolutely fucking ridiculous. plant dangerous coffee clearly helping many people live happy, stable lives without using dangerous opioids alcohol. course FDA wants treat like it‚Äôs heroin.

I‚Äôm genuinely starting wonder whether want people stay addicted dangerous drugs long big businesses able make money it. can‚Äôt think reason behaving way. people, saying 8 months 2nd shot. thing contagious viruses personal risk also happens risk whomever interact might infect, on. changes calculus completely open question, wouldn‚Äôt begin claim one right answer, consequences choices range beyond you. Consider moving yet?   like cannabis right?   can‚Äôt wait see scowling face Fox News preview tile tomorrow hero! TY! We're back ""a 9/11 every two days"" territory. 

A comment clearly remember sub, four five months ago: ""in couple months we'll like 'what about?'

And


""So practically major breakthroughs Delta infections people without significant previous illnesses Israel,"" writes Morris.

Every vaccination given adds hosts people feel fine. Eventually support left action stop spread: 'I'm vaccinated family friends, anybody still chosen vaccinated deserves everything get.' Nobody support lockdowns event cancellations social restrictions more, everybody know virus got bit cold, vast majority people hospital virus people freely chose fate.

'I've vaccine, I've done bit, I'm finished now.'

Travel nurse jobs short stints 8-13 weeks NEED hospital nurses. needs vary depending location hotspot hospital time. work GRUELING. go worst hospitals need help (if want make money). 

Hospitals cancel nurse contracts soon longer need them. making much entire year regular basis. get benefits, matching 401K, shitty health insurance none all. It‚Äôs short-stint contract work. Like guys going oil fields grueling deep sea fishing job make money bit.

825 cases today. Exactly. defeat COVID, must keep multi-layer strategy.

Agreed, many people taking Delta variant's huge increase transmitability account. way way worse original version making many people sick beginning this. expect everyone go grocery stores stock 2 weeks food supplies exactly? Like first announce lockdown? everyone, including Covid don‚Äôt know stores. won‚Äôt enough stock capacity that.

It make people get vaccinated improvement improvement. Official investigation still ongoing, I'll shocked anything actually comes it. school age kids / businesses require testing? Go urgent care get rapid antibody test - accurate. negative nasal PCR test, positive rapid test.

This absolutely end anytime soon. Here's math.

The R value first strain covid 2.3. means every 1 person got gave 2.3 people. R value 1 means virus dies out; 1 means spreads.

This vaccine target 70%. Getting 70 left 30% population vulnerable, R value 2.3 multiplied 30% 1. virus dies out.

But Delta variant R value 5.

This means vaccine rate 70% yields effective R value 1.5 delta (5 x 30% vulnerable population). virus spreads.

**With Delta, get 80% vaccination order get R value 1.** think stand chance political climate?

Get vaccinated folks, goes goes kills millions people lasts better part decade.  mom teacher 3 students tested positive today, wearing masks 6 feet away.

Let's stop playing kinds games statistics. Well good note, itll legal ban unvaccinated people places. Idiocracy horizon. wait til 113th wave, furniture starts talking back you. Perfect.  possible initial age 5-11 cohort reached six months, first dose given 


I think AAP asking approve based two month safety data, prior EUAs, side effects occur within time. FDA companies expand number subjects increase sensitivity rare side effects time, AAP said six month data could post-marketing. 

FDA might give EUA basis, can‚Äôt see giving full approval childhood vaccine less six months data require adults. hurry get EUA kids??? ten year old. older kid vaccinated hate waiting younger. 

And I‚Äôm going shut wait FDA. remember thalidomide babies. kid wait right thing science process - pressure fear. mean, *I* fear want vaccinated. want FDA job properly. ignore fear order what‚Äôs right everyone.

Polls also suggest not-insignificant number people get job requires it, trigger large number employers.

So that‚Äôs point, accepting science comes abortion. Likely?  Mississippi come! Likely? Police officers ignoring rules whatever fuck want risk public's safety....seems pretty brand me.  Oh damn that‚Äôs right. Blanked part it. bad think much.

Many/most things people consume/use significantly less research behind vaccines point.

For months now, vaccine used people worldwide pharmaceuticals even OTC medications earth. Right 4.82 billion doses administered. Even assumed 2 dose (they aren't) that's still 2.41 billion people vaccinated.

By adulthood consumed many things substantially less tested that. many things administered billion people aside McDonalds hamburgers.

Seriously. That's insane number. There's many products even manufacture 2B units entire run. Much less 2B people.

So field, know exceedingly well tested. anything doctor prescribe, certainly tested rigorous standards anything else consume.

I'm getting second dose, I'm done caring Covid. inject straight veins care. comment featured agedlikemilk 2025... Klonopin helped immensely well, know it‚Äôs long term solution. I‚Äôm seriously surprised doc prescribed long  It‚Äôs okay. Florida opened schools without allowing mask mandates. really help numbers grow. I'm waiting moderna approval kids   ‚Äúlook X country, restrictions fine!‚Äù People always full shit. 

People point UK reopened leave fact targeted contact tracing phone apps telling people isolate. leave many wear mask accord.

Contrast say, Florida, reopening means ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going go biggest party cough everyone‚Äôs face it‚Äôs right American!‚Äù Even then, I‚Äôve seen stories people hospital, hooked machines, STILL fucking go ‚Äúman feel like shit right still don‚Äôt know getting vaccine recover‚Äù

It‚Äôs worse brick wall, it‚Äôs concrete bunker fortified vibranium Feel great probably best combination near term. Natural antibodies + vaccination. doubt could get infected next 9 months tried. problem. Delta 8 game changer. People refused get vaccine treated hospitals catch covid. Stay die home smart internet research. Dont forget use plenty healing crystals essential oils! already saying beforehand. 5 years line they'll worried long term effects still.  ""We know 10 year effects vaccines!"" it‚Äôs fully approved school-aged kids (if it‚Äôs order) full-on covid vaccine clinics public schools, READY it. reading watching Sabrina...hope ok!  You‚Äôre hopefully right, experience definitely anecdotal shouldn‚Äôt taken evidence anything. said, I‚Äôve met actually quit mask mandates came back others adamant theyll return work they‚Äôre mandated get vaccine. Overall I‚Äôd say maybe 1-2 100 probably quit odd sense freedom Oh they've already said ""unless FDA approval process takes years like normally does, good enough"" I've seen several times. Word street hospitals getting together city mandate employees once, jumping ship there's else go to.

This could catalyst gets come together.

I doubt we'll see industries something. 10 11 year olds look 12, sayin guess run people eventually Good luck getting them, journey fun point reduce spread outside household. understand feel defeating. Personally, see happening. NY, seems slightly along wave right now, still incredibly low deaths (and hospitalizations.) NJ probably similar story.

At danger making bold claim-- see way things get bad winter 2020, least Northeast. he‚Äôs RN getting vaccinated, sounds awful lot like employer said must fully vaccinated middle end September. RNs could get shots December 2020. That's David Attenborough line I've ever heard one. Ive exposed Covid multiple times vaccinated. reason care unvaccinated I‚Äôll pissed music festival I‚Äôm going October canceled. infected teacher spread students?? sick. Probably takes right doctor. finally broke saw nurse practitioner via telehealth panic attacks back January (first time ever anything like that). Without even really asking, gave prescription 60 klonopin refill. I‚Äôve take 4 since got it, glad emergencies. CDC saying get better results ya dance brung ya. 

Wonder Wisconsin's announcement supply-related. *mind* mixing matching, need evidence. Here!  Time Bugs Bunny saw off. know ""forgot"" 11 year old 12 couple weeks ago forget another week. think start slowly get exponential. unfortunately started decades ago .. ? .. hygienic wear mask spit things. Nurse FFS! showing caving peer pressure

yes, texas chock full people saying colleges online next four years, masks required even zoom classes Come on, Airlines! it!   last summer I'm pretty sure percentage overall population, Chinese fewer restrictions Americans.

I think so. Life US almost back 2019 since March so, even restrictions relaxed states nearly mandates all. places like Texas Florida, pretty relevant demographic wise, businesses operating near full capacity since last September. remainder year China's tourism industry decent levels. 

So America's. Tourism Europe also recovering steadily since April - destinations Alps mediterranean suffering overbooking highways planes crowded ever.

And problem within China active outbreaks. also they're scared traveling persisting draconian policies convinced covid much serious actually (the average Chinese China pretty much convinced covid near 100% death rate - they're still heavily traumatized Wuhan) never know whether plans completely destroyed new outbreak coming way.

More generally, current policies China create lot uncertainty difficulty. time, whenever one single case pops up, transport cut off, ports shut down, flights halted, extremely difficult get business. terrible climate investing, also becoming extremely hard China get foreign workforce desperately needs - workforce would rather go somewhere else immigration easier also easier get without conform draconian policies.

Now, Chinese population willing accept. willing accept many things. Even covid put near totalitarian regime would unacceptable Westerners. unrelated issue. whether Chinese government actually believes strategy sustainable long term - answer no, know it. Covid making America great again. far I'm aware full approval vs. EUA change legal standing mandates. I'm expecting lot vaccine mandates come happens point full approval back it. someone define ""better"" since ones mandating vaccines likely mandating testing Yes sympathize situation, gambling getting Covid far worse situation. think number people actually willing put money mouth quit job lot smaller number people saying going quit job. That's illegal. Congress would amend ACA would require getting Republican votes. kids get vaccinated, going write entire thing off. mask take precautions, IMHO kids real victims here. taking entirely long roll vaccines them. Opening schools allowing virus mutate among largest unvaccinated population prove huge mistake, money king US. Assuming get lucky enough new, vaccine resistant strains come shit-show, unvaccinated people dying raise collective intelligence country least points, given huge issues deal going forward, end country may come better it. got 3rd shot last saturday. Fuck waiting. Go cvs walgreens. self asserting. say need booster autoimmune disease give shot put cdc card. uninformed mean something misinformation. Boosters recommended everyone 8 month mark effectivity waning. silly would believe boosters pushed something 90% effectiveness. studies articles top posts sub like month. Considering % population that‚Äôs vaccinated New York? Delta come given natural immunity everyone wasn‚Äôt vaccinated didn‚Äôt get previous waves?

Basically, one untouched one way another point. I‚Äôd guess 95%+ New Yorkers immune response now. 

That‚Äôs delta wave minor despite significantly increased infectivity. 

It‚Äôs different world last summer.

I would *love* FDA stopped puttering around provided full approval vaccines including children 12. Nothing would delight more. FDA proven time time they‚Äôre bureaucratic failure. 

But even without that, tremendous degree immunity population.  I‚Äôm vaccinated think it‚Äôs horrible idea sets even worse precedent. don‚Äôt believe that. may used excuse, guess we‚Äôll find soon rubber hits road. Behold percentage beast Purely political. Ya really proof negative test regardless fix developmentally socially stunted kids, can‚Äôt fix dead ones. Local community members health care talking masks vaccines accused actors dumbest argument. Reality broken can't even talk anymore. need someone repackage vaccine snake oil wonder tonic ""totally vaccine it."" It'll sell work, really matter idiots know they're vaccinated not. wouldn‚Äôt surprised it‚Äôs 1,200. Tried finding data couldn‚Äôt. Florida new Florida look digital vaccination record use instead physical fucking dumbasses. Lmao think surrounded by? Ultimately making responsible people's lives difficult enough point something motivator own; especially important keep hammering government representatives. there's one thing know count short time planet, it.

Precious fee fees anywhere radar. Data king. lot us voting oust idiots outnumbered rough everyone around mask get vaccine. Yes, worms viruses there‚Äôs doctor prescribing safe dosage. see article see words. 

&amp;#x200B;

Are photopraghs videos bad overrun places? true places parkin lot tents? I‚Äôm person clearly come site negative based comment history. Good question. think we've thought out, think need reexamine policy vs. pushing something without looking bigger picture. fault, governor last-ditch efforts pretend vaccines never big deal. all, crusaded vaccine mandates! Avoid reposting information, please. Unvaccinated individuals make vast majority hospitalizations. problem still millions upon millions unvaccinated adults. Take Mississippi example - 1.26M adults received one dose vaccine. means still 1M adults state haven‚Äôt started vaccination. That‚Äôs LOT people infect serious complications. US become identity politics issue. I‚Äôm hearing people taking horse dewormer. wheel stop spinning cyanide cure treatment? Problem solved! really tried something here. 

It‚Äôs almost like Florida basically open air nursing home comes aging population comorbidities, along fact variant spreading faster. It‚Äôs also highly vaccinated state means. They're going herd immunity :) countries less conservative mixing US CDC is. 18 year old kid able smell taste properly since January (when tested positive). 

She able eat meat since one month post-covid. Rice, pasta, toast, bananas, poptarts...she handle those. 

This shit weird. vaccine help gain back normalcy. Yes! approve seasonally haven‚Äôt able get even though RSV cases super high, typically approved November March reasonably Vaccinated, though also talking since vaccines available well. think mostly people normally come leave area world often even crossing river get side city big deal people tend homebodies.

That, attitude toward illness family ignore plow though, likely got Covid, think anything plowed through. Lots good data points here. I‚Äôm willing bet push unvaccinated, died Covid, way past 90 percent gatherings like this! There‚Äôs still plenty people unvaccinated. It‚Äôs hard concept making moral comment.  simplest explanation probably first two doses close together.

Is side effects rough second dose? Speaking myself, 48 hours, almost went ER, recommended doctor actually, 100% full week. I'm petrified happening again, feel stuck. hatred fellow man disgusting. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Also anti vaxxers: I'm specifically (I'm doctor know...), mean point ""fully vaccinated"" three shots? covid moment. day 5 symptoms getting better. reason dumb ass never got vaccinated, (bad) reasons. 

1) I'm lazy piece shit

2) like needles

3) figured young could beat covid (I beat it, breathing issues cough anymore).

Anyways, I'm getting vaccine next time leave house like 7 days now. anyone's reading unvaccinated, might want get vaccine. Even still spread vaccinated, symptoms bad. didnt even strength lift glass water mouth one hand day.

Yes, suppose media always always be, feel like hard know articles really believe surrounding COVID scenarios like this. Yes, people taking horse pills instead vaccine crazy story, we're talking couple dozen people, really kind non-event. read many articles throughout pandemic blatant fear mongering incredibly overblown feel like adds fuel skeptics' fire. bar accurate reporting incredibly high we're situation like currently find in.

You focused bolded.

The point still stands - someone contracts infectious disease vaccine preventative measures significantly reduce spread disease, make people sick ignorance, called out. mention said people contributing hospital overloads causing delays treatment unrelated illnesses. Yes! I'd suggest people take test well since lot people airport seemed think needed both. plenty around sub, Delta blessing them.  share guys I'm cruising end September: 

My husband &amp; early mid 40s, real health issues speak of, normal weight fully vaxxed. 2nd shots late Feb early March, concern. 

I work close &amp; personal ""essential"" communications retail. Like, spend hour plus customers, ""what mean password"", indoor environment Louisiana kinda retail. super cautious. skipped large events (weddings, parties, showers) etc pre-vax. grocery pick-up. one enters home besides &amp; husband.

Masks required indoors actively eating drinking.

On flights, need mask. vaxx required. test required (domestic.) nearly safe. work. Mask required only. course pandemic 2 customer tell covid positive end transaction sitting across hour plus. 

I understand risk. I'm high risk group willing accept risk gain normalcy back life. mental health important too. Travel thing. 14th cruise. risks take going work every day far exceed risk ship. 

I recommend choices everyone, right &amp; husband. curious highly vaccinated area? I‚Äôm one lowest vaccinated counties one lowest vaccinated states. We‚Äôve nearly precautions public went away summer. Although mask usage stores like Walmart picking line vaccines.

Most people I‚Äôm seeing breakthroughs around 40+ risk factors. kids friend groups teens 20s totally fine vaccinated seem virtually risk. 

Like said though experience way taken actual science. Well........at point willing let Darwinism sort out. Cant creme gene pool anyhow. Things get better.  mean, unvaccinated people **are** idiots so...there's that. areas, children (which Israel far of). ~85% adult population vaccinated. Every single binaxnow test gone stores nearby even Amazon backorders month.. want point kids get vax‚Äôd. live FL governor thinks trump. Sure percentages anti-vaxxers Israel different US. Israeli Health Ministry reported 80% Haredim 30 vaccinated. anti-vaxxers pretty small minority. y‚Äôall see people haven‚Äôt got vaccinated? shit they‚Äôre doesn‚Äôt even make sense you, VACCINATED. also people saying they‚Äôre getting vaccine feel safe get back normal still anxious fearful catching COVID new delta variant? good job protecting Tide pods lame. NEXT...... Oregon. still Alpha, really believe would done now.  emergency authorization FDA. Full approval pretty lengthy process  kids vaccinated, probably. Honestly, Delta surge, Portland summer. Also consider much less drastic things could help mitigate stuff, like promoting outdoor dining better ventilation buildings. changed radiators 1918 Flu. things take time actually build put use, we‚Äôre well way.  know take seriously still got dealt bad hand?  logic dumbfounding mom (we're dual citizens, living US whole life) traveling next Friday. praying measures slow spread. Think 94% adults England, bit lower Scotland/Wales/NI. tested positive today, makes 6/6 people house. We‚Äôre vaccinated, dad goes church pretty vaccine resistant congregation. picked spread rest us course week. cough 3-4 days finally got tested, I‚Äôm feeling pretty dumb pushing test earlier. Thankfully none us feeling bad


It messed travel plans, due fly back home country Monday, wait gf test negative, know long be. population whole 60% vaccinated highest percentage kids country OECD. *adult population*, ie group getting hospitalized, vaccinated 

Combine a) first country heavily vaccinate we'll see wane antibodies first b) extremely well-run digitized health system let's break entire country whatever risk factors vaccination statuses want 1-second SQL query makes Israel extremely important data source rest world pay attention to.

It‚Äôs situational depends nature work. That's bad data. Even though studies like lump Pfizer Moderna together since they're mRNA vaccines, recent studies shown Moderna effective. likely cause 100mcg dose size used compared 30mcg Pfizers. 
 
Moderna held fairly well, Pfizer nearly much. putting percentage together disservice Moderna states 70% range Same, it‚Äôs worst.

Unless legitimate medical reason to. vaccinated idiots. I've reading headlines every day year half. shocks still shock anyone. Also, year half reading them, think Healthcare system would giant black crater point. also interesting deaths rising much steeply UK. agree last point, I‚Äôm engineer too. transferred new team company COVID/WFH. existing working relationship anyone team started going back part-time.

They‚Äôre either gonna suck get shot see privileges stripped away. think we‚Äôre gonna see huge surge vaccinations it‚Äôs required air travel. there's point wearing masks? Arab Israelis included Israeli state statistics. Palestinians authority Palestinian Ministry Health since Oslo Accords ""on books"" nearly thirty years. part Oslo's transfer autonomy Palestinian Authority includes government ministries like education instance well.

That said, Israel offer help PA vaccines offer refused. full before? Brb, gotta go fill pool water gets turned refuse treatment anyone follow basic safety guidelines.

They've already lost public trust. certainly care well humanity getting half population addicted pharmaceutical heroin cocaine  population much much older though Receiving 2nd dose gives sense immunity, I‚Äôm worried foreigners cannot gain access healthcare services. Pfizer many vaccines offered national citizens foreigners must go lengthy process appointment date maybe don‚Äôt trust bro idk may excuse they're looking for, get vaccinated without loosing face. calm discussion anti-covid vaccine person. started approved line, went ""millions sick dead"" vaccine, ""I'd rather body"" bla bla bla. shared article fda approved week linked back video people throwing cheese kid's head. I'm really sure trying prove video but... Stilettos unbreakable !! opponent saying Abbott violated ‚Äúfreedoms‚Äù issuing limited mask mandate back 2020.

This part pandemic always scratching head lol like sharing air.. know covid airborne anyone safe?

I SF couple weeks back dined times, went Giants game well. Im fully vaccinated still opted patio whenever possible. impressed many ppl complying mask mandate city seems still good shape covid numbers wise good news. No, meant would mandatory vaccination teachers. indicate vaccine isn‚Äôt working. 60+ population Israel vaccination rate 90%. account half serious cases indicates 90% population accounts 50% cases. Older Israelis also among first vaccinated world. fact breakthrough cases happening population surprising. also renders cheap masks quite ineffective. 

Like trying filter dust chain link fence gates either side wide open.   Maybe. vaccine kids, one necessary risk isn‚Äôt. Sounds like someone ex-friend. Delta vaccine breakthroughs common. Much US denial, CDC even track vaccine breakthrough cases end hospital.

LA county, tracking this, announced 30% Covid cases vaccine honest question, why? position worried vaccine side effects first came waited bit getting them, still got months ago huge amount people already gotten them, rna ones issues. dont get full approval actually matters now, basically formality Uptick vaccinations US going right now. Full FDA approval Pfizer Monday.

Things looking good. giving middle finger Covid going win. Pfizer one best vaccine get then? everyone‚Äôs needs priorities exactly right?

Serious question. already covid(immune system exposed virus made antibodies) would reason get shot(which thing)? Israel pretty non-homogeneous vaccination rate, right? pockets low vaccination elsewhere it‚Äôs high. 

If Covid spreads rapidly areas 90% vaccination also causes problems (hospitalization death) that‚Äôs concerning. hope New Zealand successful fight Delta outbreak.  gonk raptor didn‚Äôt go planned eh?

There's cost education there's also waiting lists get medical programs. rest world deal well much longer lasting restrictions daily life? Thank god. need start planning realistically messaging better. jump messaging horrendous. endemic.

since delineated 70 came two percentages, i'm asking denominator numerator two numbers add come something close numbers got google (rounded course ease quick math, though easy enough exact exact numbers work with).

what i'm failing understand translate words japanese, must clearly read well gather exact calculations it, rest us better understand it.

now far logic said, since give exact numbers. here's simple explanation : said ""deaths 70s Japan totals 1.22 thousandths 1 percent since pandemic began. 251 serious cases currently age group. 70s deaths 1/100 1%""

which means 70s 0.00122% 70s 0.01%, correct? aggregate rounded total said ""15,000 deaths 125 million people total, that's 0.012%"" wanted accurate, that's cool, try : 15,592 population 126.3 million percent 0.012345209817893905% exact enough?

when working two groups one 0.01% (you tell far can't get exact, lower worse math skills) 0.00122% overall 0.012345209817893905% population sizes must 600 people 0.00122% group every 1 person 0.01% group (which calculate want use wolfram alpha whatever prefer)

so ask, could tell actual number 70 deaths, 70 deaths, two population sizes math? power ten one percentages, share actual numbers none us figure one decide important is. 

you obviously reply since proud, jesus moving decimal calculations like really easy mess up, admit it, fix argument becomes much better. Japanese generally pretty good masks.

We home Moscow, retuned US two days ago spending 2 months Moscow, Ryazan, Novosibirsk, Kemerovo regions. People careless whether middle Kuznetsky middle Kuzbass. sad, little frightening.  FDA approval expected coming week. 

Just saying time find new excuse.  google search needed thanks means health care workers make decisions get hospitalized won‚Äôt can‚Äôt fit anywhere don‚Äôt enough staff Ain‚Äôt party like classroom party cuz classroom party mandatory!

Obviously sucks, you‚Äôve gotten far without learning least little ways avoid stuff take care yourself, mean‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt really know say that. understand Delta much contagious, ask, what‚Äôs alternative here? Giving up? exactly make sense? like vaccines time. First EUA, fully approved one. think prioritize fully approved like I'm shocked it. vaccine EUA still ""real"" vaccine considered vaccinated. 

Vaccinated people scared Delta variant vaccinated always prevent infection symptomatic disease, sure almost cases makes illness much milder. Vaccines supposed always fully shield infection, also depends disease immune system.   clue picked up. could gone friend's house hour, sat around drinking tea eating crumpets talking ole days got friend asymptomatic.   following UK numbers late, understanding hospitalization death way down, hospitals coping numbers getting rate growth, vaccination / infection drastically reduced severity current infections.

That case, think big issues. I'm wrong, yeah, something watch. treatments coming? years racism loads political paper work war drugs.  Yes agree  I‚Äôm surprised would even consider DNA vaccines given risk permanent genome incorporation, several veterinary vaccines already number human investigations. I, too, long COVID also case me. sucks. Ye1s, surely global scientific community wrong abou Covid trust Alex Jones Donald Trump comes medical advice. got figured out, huh?

Don't forget drink lots bleach stay healthy, fucking genius.   Exactly FDA approve use?   Breakthrough covid still land hospital bud. bills disappear got vax before.

Again, seems arbitrary since every child hits puberty different times, seem unreasonable attempt distinction. Additionally, younger age make arguments issues informed consent since child cannot legally consent much anything really. 

To clear, also think likely puberty would change whole lot (not expert, though) consent piece huge issue since allow parents make kinds life decisions children prior course (like routine vaccinations). addition this, risk covid continue mutate something transmissible deadly fail vaccinate unvaccinated people. come Australia vaccinating going lockdown?

Yup. that's headline. issues myocarditis well, could delay EUA October I‚Äôd imagine.

To clarify, issues. concern exaggerated. problem myocarditis already extremely rare. expected, 436,000 doses 8 would show myocarditis. 16. taking entire 2.8 million doses, 23 showed it, well expected range 2 53.

The reality myocarditis rare hard get exact number. Sample sizes rarely large. Also, vaccine triggers somewhat strong immune response expose myocarditis rather actually cause it. fact, COVID getting vaccine likely show myocarditis meaning likely COVID causes first wait. know long term effects covid, fact point.

Also, attacks thst insecure? Cant civil discord? Yeah wear seatbelt prevent body flying windshield I'm rollover, what's point? go randomly sleeping around strangers without condom? that's point I'm trying make. Yeah probably low chance catch STDs, there's still chance. first shot. I‚Äôm glad finally made decision get vaccinated late‚Ä¶ bad didn‚Äôt make decision sooner. feel bad children. Virologists seem think mutations slow time. said that. Maybe that‚Äôs wrong experts said. *Hey Tucker, lift back.* would say anyone talk doctor first bad side effects first two doses. people, added protection may worth risk, others may not.

Personally, mid-20s male notable side effects (literally swollen lymph nodes, sick either shot, though previously COVID getting first dose), I'll getting booster I'm eligible. Last summer, people still sorting risky things vaccines, boss wife wanted visit parents mid-90s. want risk airports quarantined 14 days drove there.

Only started Georgia went Seattle! travel trailer towed SUV go buildings, slept ate showered used bathroom trailer, got groceries food curbside pickup. stayed two weeks parents drove way back. I‚Äôm scientist (not epidemiology anyway), that‚Äôs listen scientists. try sometime :) do! completely. 
There subset type group makes active choice carve life themselves.

They decide society inevitably going collapse, jump logical (to them) conclusion self sufficient. 
I actually quite idea kids ‚Äò08 global crash. 
It helped shape thinking money security, able incorporate general thinking without going full mad max. 

If fully simply buy prophesies though, could see bad end. 
Some people claim things like impending full monetary system collapse divest standard currencies get rid possessions. 
That kind putting eggs unlikely basket. Anyone else feeling like gonna go forever? I'm fully vaccinated, job reinstated mask mandate indefinitely city government, cases high right vaccines coming out, events cancelled left right again. seems like we're right back square one pandemic, ugh don‚Äôt give fuck office. wanted job paycheck lol often happens get cold. result immune system fighting initial infection.

Calling critical patients even room ethereal feeling, like treat critical require medical equipment? almost went entire week without physically go work. 

I seen co-workers in-person since March April 2020. One comes office week, never needed come in. 

We weekly Zoom meetings. moved every week. check in, see computer, talk we've working on, we're going working on. 

If people *can* work remotely, make come in?

I guess Software people remote, Hardware people come in, cause resentment. Maybe cut &amp; dry Apple... always back trial time. authorized, unblind ask. 150ish people quit Methodist Houston. even drop bucket. Proving ""safe"" goes longer rigorous testing. Vaxxed &amp; Wellbutrined checking in.  That‚Äôs exactly point though. MUCH pressure approve it, wouldn‚Äôt certain they‚Äôd followed everything. ignored pressure jobs. countries lot thalidomide babies, US - whose mothers obtained countries, IIRC. 

I‚Äôm counting thing now. Ignore us parents complaining pressuring release it. job thoroughly correctly. like thalidomide. keep tabs people don't? ""Honor system""?  Update us actually goes lol think looking hospitalizations per 100k people critical. I'm sure data shows Isreal. Moderna going hot booster shot. Yes, doctors actually it. know I‚Äôll scouring local pages news one come Monday. plan every state requesting out-of-state help states left? theoretically, mean. wondering. Age 5-11 cohort started late March. Younger age cohorts started that. Looks like Wuhan jan 2020 use Citizen, personally. Pretty much already might better asymptomatic people felt like cold, might think get tested (especially around high-risk people).

Having people get sick enough hospital would course better. so? Europe allows it. ""F"" ""*fucked*""  believe smart health card qr CA system cardboard. I'm going assume loss respect tied getting vaccine. fact sleeps firehall. Honestly anti-vax crazies scare actual virus now. Look much society breaks accommodate morons. No, I'm trolling. gets bad enough (and Florida/Texas may point) people would rather ration food risk getting COVID store. likely ever close people need get food point, gets point hospitals literally closed, many people decide even leave house. Imagine headlines cold war era US Soviet Russia imposed water rationing government hiding control pandemic.

This shit wild Yikes! fuckin duh Ditto! Seen new goalposts lately - clinical trials completing 2023. mandated get or..? Lol  mean get ya waiting FDA approval probably sane reason wait. I'm fucking tired üòä Note UK government estimate R always horrendously date (by around month - noticeably laggy relative estimates r/coronavirusUK use 14 day baseline); also error bars reporting 1dp seem pretty conservative right now.

R appear (slowly) rising, 14 day baseline calculation (7 day average v.s. 7 day average week ago) still R 1.05; ideal, manageable short medium term. wrong direction though, say.

To mind big concern carry like figures high (and rising) really enough require new restrictions, little room manoeuvre schools reopen early September seasonal effects also turn us. going ask update Moderna. Last heard process submitting approval month.  Thanks this, helping kids everywhere. see‚Ä¶ sure dude.  hospitalizations  uotpic \~100% treeshold)

What mean? vaccines fully approved Health Canada whole time still hear Canadian anti vaxx idiots saying ""they havent approved! emergency use!""

That tell much people give shit approval. total lie. find reason get it. Meanwhile ... CDC ...


CDC: Students Wearing Masks Longer Need Quarantine, Even ‚ÄòClose  started kiss, end like this, (an unmasked) kiss would skip saunas. go Saunas others? May put risk. dynavap great piece kit. Time. vaccines ""rushed"" middle pandemic get public limit impact. wasnt time test every aspect make optimal version (dosage, time shots).

the vaccines trials two endpoints: limit transmission limit severe disease death. Modernas intial trial 6% ‚Äùbreakthrough‚Äù cases, words, 94% efficacy. Everyone seemed got idea vaccines designed entirely stop transmission, never case -- right data got approved. everyone acting like vaccines failing arms breakthrough cases.

Now delta causing breakthroughs due longer time actively carry without knowing it..

But ultimately that's minor still highly effective preventing severe disease death, secondary endpoint trials. 

Again. current vaccines great, even delta. issue many unvaccinated people roaming around exacerbating spread delta.. deal huge impacts healthcare system again. daughter enrolled pediatric Pfizer clinical trial, reason adding kids (when ready wrap things up) Delta wave US. parts concluded didn‚Äôt much testing real world exposure kids weren‚Äôt school, Delta wasn‚Äôt prominent US yet, etc. conditions changed, FDA decided like 4,500-10,000 kids enrolled get accurate efficacy numbers current conditions.

Everyone tests positive Covid19 eventually test negative. repeat, everyone eventually test negative (or die). Everyone. largest window world. I've seen high earning individuals test every single day. Sx day 1 positive positive day 1-5 day 6 they're negative. 

For asymptomatic individuals? day 2 14 asymptomatic illness? way know.

The situation much better though. say vaccinated start really getting hospitalized. Even data shows additional booster help starts become issue.

But yea surprised months fall/winter comes situation ends almost flipping US country. surprised see northeast areas large numbers cases. Many schools still started potential spread. Flu season could end double whammy. Flu luckily last year many restrictions distancing lifted, lots mask use less kids back school.

Going tough think expect things much better coming spring. course rest world gets vaccinated, people probably cautious things might take way back normal. People need work (jobs sick time) won‚Äôt get tested. Solved? Great. company mandated vaccines, everyone required get covid test Mondays plan coming office week, vaccinated not. also paying providing testing nice. psychotics incorporate approval psychosis. know FDA reports George Soras Bill Gates owns majority shares. course gonna approve. makes sense think it. That's studies seen are. % number people unvaxxed dying severely ill compared vaxxed significantly different.

You cannot look raw numbers since evenly distributed start with. Ah ok. worries  Birth control cause blood clots. approved.. Nearly every drug ""cause damage"". talking about? comment wasn‚Äôt actually directed toward you, agree. It‚Äôs funny hear people yelling focus vaccines rather treatments 1000s companies doctors aren‚Äôt trying everything possible treat patients. vaccine day 1 given disclaimer likely ticket victory. children?

Damn can‚Äôt werewolf don‚Äôt want stinking vaccine! find way wet paper bag. dumb rock less useful. FDA approval means safe

It's good thing FDA approving this, blatantly untrue. Vancouver Washington proud boys coming flex rough Portland tomorrow. Yay... clear, said covid bad. say ""bad"" case. sounds like home, relatively speaking still mild case.   you‚Äôre one gets long Covid waiting world get vaccinated, then, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd change tune. Smokers drastically lower covid rates. smoker unvaccinated, offset right? couple older kids died hospital. One without health issues. Pericarditis, virologist friend tells me. hope get extra thorough brain tickling every time get tested. world they'd paying every test, too. reassuring already knew safe got them? governor refuses anything except tell everyone trust everyone make best decision them.

Except Covid. puts house arrest jails/fines leave. people nerve say mask mandate restriction freedom? sheesh Never heard it. checked out. Pretty useful. Good see R area turned. exactly it. one truly believes hard-core anti-vaxxers going change mind approved. trust government, trust FDA.

For example, exactly illegal walk vaccine hand (as opposed deltoid)?

Second, exactly ‚Äúreally stupid‚Äù give child exact thing thousands children already gotten trials? (Assuming know administer vaccine, e.g. you‚Äôre medical professional)

Does main problem lie act giving child ‚Äúunapproved‚Äù substance? genuinely wonder losing type people stupid enough end career hill around good thing hospital. would surprised taking shortcuts compromising health patients sorts areas. much misinformation here, damm anti-vaxers will, definitely put lot people's minds ease.

That's problem - pasteurize. love cheese much never gets past eyes grab eat it. lol. again. bit much. i'm going guess lot coworkers mind working remotely. Yep goal posts keep moving suppenly FDA approval apart conspiracy caused rapid unexpected drop?  Sounds like maybe didn‚Äôt mask kids? blaming admits may gotten lax given lack mandates. Hope recovers kids stay safe. sounds scary! know something wrong? anything health made susceptible (thinking retrospect)? mom still vaccinated thinks she‚Äôs 1 million case (she‚Äôs absolutely convinced *her* personal rate serious side effects vaccination 100%). provide info? Genuinely curious learn fair deaths low general , vaccination . doesn‚Äôt really mean anything Wait mean? Grand Ole Pile Poo making gambling opposing Joe, sabotaging vaccination effort pay politically end, whatever percentage dies enough make difference. brainwashed base even blame misinformation killed people loved. 

Rump could done anything else incapable changing mind. Changing mind sign weakness greatest fear.

But saying Covid could like MERS grossly exaggerated. Even handled properly, still would bad. less so.   gonna one hell todesfahrt. Hopefully. can‚Äôt fucking deal 2022 would litterallt riot happens kids start getting infected outside school? need get kind approval 5-11yr olds. Mine yet, surprise soon.

Edit: [Here likely give ammo business (such hospitals) schools require vaccines continued employment/enrollment. 

Unfortunately, people real antivaxxers ones distrust government general, including FDA, much except eliminate ""experimental vaccine"" talking points.  I‚Äôm really struggling understand logic here. still wide open barely hospitable capacity, shut last winter/spring hospital capacity reached 300. Why? plans get covid? covid despite 2 Pfizer doses, masking social distancing, required work function made impossible. took one idiot coworker boom. mild case. 

I think shitty thing many repercussions has. dispute need halt pandemic, losing 2 4 weeks work. kids school / without socialization 4 weeks. wife losing ton work time. ALso ended exposing lot people, friends family. mild symptoms, got PCR based test negative. assumed clear. definitive test yesterday positive. 

I get need halt pandemic, I'm sure worth cost point. going personally end causing whole chunks micro economy halt ( run business, wife's business likely shut down). want callous man absolutely massive cost this, ends mild cold, hard. know intellectually could easily kill people. think understand sympathic want keep going.  (I definitely pro mask pro vax, let 100% clear). Biden made announcement would program getting people third shots got lot backlash CDC doctors.

I mean, maybe like, shots laying around, can't convince anyone get first shot, may well give people third? Seems like either effort get first shots (for example make mandatory certain situations) give shots countries.  Honestly, hard sometimes tell someone generally misinformed honestly seeking truth, trolling, think people thought latter downvoted result 100% going happen next.

Antivaxers: FDA took long approve vaccine dangerous. Proof dangerous. Theoretically it‚Äôs possible catch covid right still month. It‚Äôs likely all, it‚Äôs possible. It‚Äôs significantly likely catch still 2 weeks later, though still probably particularly likely. general guidance longer contagious 10 days testing positive/symptoms begin. wildcard pcr test, common, pick viral rna past time actually infected/contagious. I‚Äôve seen anecdotes weeks even months after. Again, probably extreme outliers, it‚Äôs possible. 

If life depended passing pcr test, I‚Äôd probably isolate month before. something wanted stakes low, I‚Äôd probably days week. Lots variables decide though. reading comments, seems like people still got clue vaccine does.

it doesnt guarantee catching covid (in fact covid inevitable, we'll catch sooner later) prevent hospitalization even death. simple. point trying make though? called Spanish Flu Spain actually reported factually nations kept denying things (likely due war). Pro-tip: read articles commenting.

""Romania announced would donate 1.3 million AstraZeneca vaccines Tunisia, Egypt, Albania Vietnam"" know sarcastic FDA approved. I've dispensed worms scabies humans. retail pharmacy use work hospital work now. said work covid. Theres fb videos claiming cures covid 100% success rate. Well I've personally seen patients get still die. Good, maybe forcing people get vaccine finally stop mask mandates finally stop listen crybabies moan wearing piece cloth.  see that's different quarantine *have symptoms* (not test positive only) think way save face. hard admit wrong evrything much easier pretend waiting along. evolution hard work. sympathy folks  saying is

Thats exactly saying. Even admitting zero proof. believe entire US military require it. Huh? forget read sentence preceding that?

If vaccine immunity drops time, freshly vaccinated people never going better protected future today


This even scientific statement, simple logic statement get vaccinated

Your logic fundamentally flawed. *need* reason *not* get vaccinated.

At given time I'm *not* conceivably *infinite* number things. I'm climbing Mt. Everest, today, ever. I'm pursuing Ph.D. cinema studies. explanation I'm not; I'm simply not. default state *not* given thing given time.

You go ahead tell think *should*, think best interest thing. I'm free ignore reject reasons continue not-do whatever want. one greatest freedoms have, not-do something. ancestors probably got whipped tending fields, I'm free man not-do discretion. beautiful thing, try it.

The difference *I care do*. want get vaccinated, means, get vaccinated! hope feel safe now! I'm criticize vaccinated decisions, far self-righteously want impose think right choice upon dare ask justify I'm doing.  We've reminding people almost every month covid break dick like antivaxxers using regularly anyway.  Wouldn‚Äôt seen lambda wave India similarly hit country? Kappa currently since April, hasn‚Äôt able make nearly kind impact Delta. definition high? Stable genius also gives doctors digression label. basically whatever want vaccines regards administration. I‚Äôm sociopath. failures follow even basic public health safety precautions puts literally EVERYONE risk. plaguerats created Delta variant. there‚Äôs children dying it. contrarian doesn‚Äôt make correct, makes disease vector. really. comparison countries, they're behind vaccinations. people dying rates never seen, no, ‚Äúthat won‚Äôt happen here.‚Äù

Hell, could go back Jan 2020, Wuhan first locked down

People exact sentiment - ""*it happen - free advanced society*"" want know to. It‚Äôs still cleared FDA don‚Äôt see true science behind aren‚Äôt elderly immunocompromised needing third shot. seems overly better safe sorry Didn‚Äôt symptoms let within 2 days? 3.2 vs 1.6 whatever rate vaccinated people load BS risk adjusted. disproportionate amount young people unvaccinated group majorly risk. Similarly, vaccinated population includes risk (I‚Äôd imagine 90% 60s vaccinated).

Now don‚Äôt know risk adjusted rates cannot draw accurate conclusions without knowledge Interesting read. Thank posting! Wut? link support efficacy falling off. show vaccines less effective vs delta variant, absolutely correct. That's vaccine losing efficacy faster vaccine history, stated.

Yes, efficacy lower vs new virus exist vaccine developed may come consequence vaccine. news, COVID vaccine protect flu.

Booster shots improve vaccine efficacy starting soon, common vaccines. 99% efficacy vaccine mentioned 4 dose regime across years get there.


That's small amount need know. read lot more. Education learning means human. children simply wear masks properly

Since perfect even try. Got it.

This logic anti-vaxx crowd now, vaccine ironclad 100% guarantee get sick fuck it; EvEn WoRK I'm still getting it. pointless. likely catch/spread Covid without vaccine. health issues whatsoever taking worthless ""vaccine"" make sense.

Yes, people still catching bad cases Covid even Vaccine.

[I vaccinated got COVID It‚Äôs funny you‚Äôre accusing someone bad science yet don‚Äôt understand basic things like ‚Äúpercentage of‚Äù. We‚Äôre talking percentage already hospital already dead, vaccinated vs unvaccinated. suppose emphasized ""a few"" more. think insignificant figure huge. 

My uninsured, unvaccinated family already treat emergency room like doctor's office. imagine continue GoFundMe campaigns posted fact. Yes thought original premise behind booster shot develop new vaccine effective variants. booster shot exact vaccine? read justified/a good idea. They're saying antivaxxers anti maskers worse, think. said ""experimental"" fully approved... say now? What's holding Moderna? even gotten EUA 12+ yet. essentially vax? guess? relatively low case rates now, much less natural immunity places. seeing similar stuff Washington Hawaii hear you, personal freedom tends end impedes someone else‚Äôs freedom. sick ass doesn‚Äôt right spread deadly disease safe effective vaccine available free.

Is really, compared Louisiana showed cited worse rates metric?

Florida 25th terms covid deaths per 100k population.

Louisiana 254 deaths per 100k, whereas FL 190.

You mention FL killing people, well, we're 33% less Louisiana, much 25 states, metric.

You‚Äôre great person üå∏  I‚Äôm happy you~ two injections Pfizer vaccine. people say ""fully vaccinated' implying double dose fully protective (which disagree with). I'd say double. Tomatoe, tomato. Yea viruses mutate survive. alpha strain runs something kills it(like vaccine) change immune I‚Äôve seen lot people post similar sentiments, really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs messaging issue much they‚Äôre trying keep evolving situation.

This true. 

In **symptomatic breakthrough cases** viral load potentially reach peak levels unvaccinated, much shorter period time. symptomatic breakthrough cases still uncommon.

The *system* makes difficult. FAFSA questions tax forms, requires parental information-- SOL parents give you. someone works closely many departments higher ed, *want* make difficult... least institution bend backwards work-- work within rules **huge** systematic issues. right, making college (really, truly) accessible 100% necessary!! hope able find way continue education get little financial hardship possible. worst parts Spanish flu 100 years ago, sick patients would lay floor waiting somebody bed die, could lay bed bit dying.   No. Nope. 

mRNA vaccines making decades, motivated SARS-CoV-1 early 2000s. 

The backbone research development already established literal years. tweaked SARS-CoV-2. 

Stop spreading bullshit. Stop spreading disinformation. Stop spewing vague reasons people won‚Äôt get vaccinated. 

This vaccine likely getting full FDA approval Monday quite frankly, think us sub done giving shit trying even engage people like happens. 

There literally excuses left. I‚Äôm done caring are. One thing people forget regarding Florida ingress egress rate. Florida one heavily touristed states America also popular Festination tourists world.

Example. audit many Americans visited Florida became infected spread infection got back home. Much could prevented social distancing masking would place.

This unreported part Florida pandemic. think there's mass shooting. Las Vegas music festival one, nearest hospital got blitzed incoming gunshot victims. Wow, natural selection real-time. Hello,

What happen miss 2nd shot? take 2nd dose roughly three weeks. intend miss situation bit unstable currently live. case shot delayed, much ""leeway"" effects meaningless?

\- Would taking ""2nd shot"" five weeks counts first dose initial one dilluted?  
\- Would taking different brand five weeks work considered risky mix-and-matching? 

Or enough research far concise answer?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you. Firstly, article talking methods mitigate virus, focused vaccines kids. creating straw man argument. That's obscuring real issues. politicization COVID mitigation efforts right lead backlash. misrepresentation articles arguments example.

Secondly, sense life experiment outcomes unknown, outcomes predictable based past experience. 100% guarantees (chef Justin contrary).

Past experience vaccines much positive negative. Past experience letting viruses run rampant shown high death tolls long lasting effects. That's true even talking COVID-19 variants.

That's wearing mask important. low impact ages. shown effective. could possibly made clear vaccine paperwork signed vaccine FDA approved instead administered FDA emergency use authorization. understand UK, feel monitors would alarm almost instantly placed overcrowded classrooms US

Don't worry, schools England crowded * ""insulting"" I‚Äôm curious seriously ill young patients. Definitely curious age prior health. NPR article cites another article didn‚Äôt cite anything claim:

‚ÄúIn contrast, ""the unvaccinated COVID patients see young, healthy, working people condition deteriorates rapidly,"" said. ""Suddenly they're put oxygen respirator.""

I wonder there‚Äôs research show that, would super concerning. wife got COVID back October last year still taste issue. It‚Äôs insane. wrote school board member let know representing family‚Äôs interests responsibly. elderly brother LOVES cruising. get it. says he's never sick one. Okay. pre-covid times. wants go cruising Fall (out FL less). talk sense him? BTW wife recent cancer survivor former nurse. aboard also. see username chain commented on. see others. Looks like griff87 dare cautious vaccine! Prepare downvotes mean educational freedom? Genuinely curious. Texas trying give parents ‚Äúchoice‚Äù years funding private charter schools done hurt public schools funding crappy charter schools. Totally right. UVA freedom disenroll students reason wants provided protected category (Religion, race, gender, etc) 

Amazing ""freedom"" conservatives fight right bakery refuse service LGBT people freedom public private institutions refuse service ignorant superspreaders.   long term effects covid?   Ugh, sorry vaccine really rushed realize technology around tweaked covid. reason believe could repurcussions 20 years? often happened vaccines (serious question)?   imagine like age lockdowns. many people talking allow parents allowed see parents. plan whole life last years go flames. I‚Äôd start looking relative risks things too. ""I'm sorry, send ambulances stupid.""    gone elimination route, aka Zero COVID. Vaccines alone cannot provide that. know well now. 

Having saying that, doubt Australian outbreak controlled. need live virus like everyone else. fault, us jeopardized thier strategy.  public health professional trying also read interpret research really helped see far media gone distorting conversation. I‚Äôm grateful know actually interpret public health data agree you. Compared without vaccine without prior infection, research continues support vaccines effective preventing serious side effects covid. Though data never strong conclusive would think way run reductionist explain actions generalize something apply pretty crazy.

Though fair [CDC recent instance quote concerning reporting methods specifically conclusions thoroughly supported research cite [not research larger CDCs five limitations see far reasonably generalize findings. don‚Äôt see support conclusions based evidence put forward. 

Anyways thanks sticking science, aren‚Äôt many us educating people actually going science own. Plenty conspiracy theories turned true,

Can provide examples? people say this, hardly conspiracy theory, rather common knowledge nothing done companies involved huge donors. Like Exxon covering climate change.  think elderly risk groups take booster.TBH probably take jabbed way back January.To really get handle variants need stomp breeding grounds(the unvaccinated).Aside playing wack mole. comment obvious irrelevant comment it. label uses thing. way common think. drug FDA approved different indication know safety profile. judge risk vs benefit. risk low, what's side? I'm literally keeping track says call bullshit years future.

remember want going full bore next conspiracy, call bullshit way welcomes back sanity.

Don't pull punches saying things like ""dude kidding, guzzling koolaid. Glad got vaxxed though."" lot breakthrough cases extended social circles I‚Äôm taking cautious approach (live life errands need minimize social events crowds) winter see friends do. Anecdotally lot I‚Äôm seeing Pfizer spring seems similar lot numbers coming Israel. I‚Äôm also watching situation. I‚Äôve given caring willingly unvaccinated. We‚Äôve pretty much taken approach end life planning enjoy time one unvaccinated family member can‚Äôt cut out. I‚Äôm religious all. hate religion. What‚Äôs next theory? Phuck around phind out?   Yeah don‚Äôt plan getting covid. Vaccines, general, work well older people immune systems work well.

That's dose pneumonia vaccine much higher younger population dose. starts local level though better funding public schools education based science religion racism. Yeah Florida vaccine mandate teachers. Letting children twelve return school giant experiment.

Though many seem agree developmentally socially stunted kids would worse COVID infected kids. There's debate scientific community boosters. Keep mind booster vaccine first two doses efficacy vs. delta part initial larger studies. 
Personally since thankful part high risk group hold off, respect others opinions . banning opiate medication?   Found sounds like doctors might prescribe kids 12 feel appropriate. think kids conditions make vulnerable surprised doctors boots ground children's hospitals seen firsthand effects delta healthy kids may decide start vaccinating could full approval Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine open door doctors give¬†booster doses certain fully vaccinated adults¬†or even¬†vaccinate children 12? killing future soldiers ones buy signing wanting fight. Thinning herd propaganda. government won‚Äôt put stop bulimic cheerleaders.   Thanks!  reasonable supposition bad spot before?  agree principle. better analogy drunk driving dumping pollution river. 

If don‚Äôt wear seatbelt, you‚Äôre endangering yourself. Unvaccinated people negatively impact health others community. try liken discrimination. job didn‚Äôt take qualifications weren‚Äôt high another person, that‚Äôs understandable. I‚Äôm *generally* within power improve situation find job elsewhere. job didn‚Äôt take colour skin, nationality, sexual orientation, things go home ‚Äúimprove‚Äù.

Likewise, job doesn‚Äôt take vaccinated, well option go get vaccinated it‚Äôs pretty painless easy too. There‚Äôs nothing stopping personal convictions, which, people discussion, founded sound logic. argument ‚Äúit‚Äôs right‚Äù. Ironically - also science. lmao. using site allowed /r/jailbait exist decade  actually believe majority Americans made good faith effort stay home back then?  give studies, call fear. I'm still sure know stuff works, looking confirm bias them.  

That's sad.    I'll keep touch doctor get specific advice then. hit Reddit knew answers could come bit faster. Huge lockdown like go pop doctor easily far. I'll call shoot mail. hear you, personal freedom tends end impedes someone else‚Äôs freedom. sick ass doesn‚Äôt right spread deadly disease safe effective vaccine available free. 

Actually, do. illegal leave house flu. law call work mono. right thing do, compelled. 

To create scenario imagining here, would essentially imprison unvaxxed forever. Covid going away. People dying covid rest life, matter reach critical 80% vaxxed not. 

We live people. None us choice. So, focus energy control. choices actions. let happen. Downvotes, come come on, man... darwinism motion. way they‚Äôre bad covid reaction (a lot people are) 
They send home, you‚Äôre still admitted hospital. nurse comes day night. call acute stage. thing obvious signs covid issues. He‚Äôs first two days symptoms 
It‚Äôs inevitable sickle cell crisis happen time sick. hope doesn‚Äôt send home.  still arguing masks get point enough people immunity, either vaccines infection, run risk overwhelming hospitals every time cluster infections breaks out. point community risk Covid flu is. yet, quickly Delta infecting people pushing others get vaccinated hopeful winter last one dragged Covid. weren‚Äôt even target comment really nothing you. yeah doctors push opiate medication pain management plan. experience. doctors still discriminate medical marijuana usage well. need help guys. I've trying find article Biden vaccinated along people white house.

I've looked everywhere nothing.

We also donate regularly Serbia Moldova

But countries receiving must also logistics handle them. Time move goal posts antivaxxers. Sunburn inside? Meanwhile India we're open declare end pandemic, again. Covid like ""deja vu, mother******""  No. viral vector based vaccines like Astra Zeneca Sputnik V use adenovirus lie. one people. dismissed January 2020. took seriously got prior totally dismissed it. clickbait. difficult understand rights actually trampled on, longer choice thing, actually choice, still options, like getting vaccinated working somewhere else. right vote infringed, can't vote. right free speech infringed, government put jail murdered damaged life much can't scared speak out. Private businesses schools profit health institutions mandating must vaccinate work forcing anything, right work specific company attend specific school work specific company. doctor refuses see you, refer another doctor, go different medical center. choices. That's infringing rights. get accustomed exotic cuisine, like poutine Tim Horton's. I'm 100% convinced boosters since regular dose regimen still protective severe COVID, boosters proven actually increase efficacy infection, I'll them. Yes, yes works well people get tested daily like Trump Abbot. catch really early, get immediate monoclonal treatment. rest us wait couple days see allergies, wait test appointment (when surge), wait 2 days results. responsible people. deniers even think covid. What's crazy people saying ""COVID real"" also saying Govt keeping cures secret... also putting ""fake"" vaccines. Oh really? Redditors patience? making ridiculously stupid analogy comparing toilet paper massive government agency. can't handle criticism FDA they're ""side"" one single issue. Proving point. see.

For 1st shot Sinopharm may able ""choose"" 2nd dose end Moderna AZ. guess I'll take low risk since would better keeping 1st dose.

Thanks, I'll read thoroughly cdc doc however.  Moderna company data: slide 28+ [in quarterly  think would lot published (and pfizer), little worrisome. FDA applications public include everything eventually.

The multivalent 617 booster data/hints equally promising. really looks like probably using multivalent vaccines everything now. Oh wow, would make day.  No, no, good. Let's let play out. feel national average IQ inching upward. Dude! Imagine CHOOSING medicine 3rd world country! See think problem mostly messaging. dribbling every time new research data found. 

The CDC prime time news conference lays absolute beginning pandemic US -

We learned this, advised 
And bring thru now. 

I want raw, unbiased data statistics heck risk level is. 
Because point I‚Äôm pretty sure ppl don‚Äôt clue.

Anyway, even first shot seems provide fairly substantial immunity. two shot regimen Pfizer Moderna sure single dose would give enough immunity get authorized (we know likely would), played safe. artifact tested studied, they're specifically designed work used tandem.  tested two days road trip visit parents Christmas. First test negative. Tested two days later arrived positive. Tested following two days negative. PCR tests. Even doctors spoke said false positive. took antibody test week later negative antibodies. It‚Äôs super weird I‚Äôm getting downvoted much. Like people don‚Äôt want even acknowledge possibility.

Edit: saying discredit point, think certainly valid. offering context particular situation I‚Äôm certain false positive. Kudos!   dumbest ones seem dying though... Ok. sure anything said.

The Oregon Army National Guard deployed help local hospitals understaffed overwhelmed surge covid cases. happened 12 us clickbait So, despite debate scientific community, (due scientific ethical concerns), moving full steam ahead. decision didn‚Äôt pose risk others

Even vaccinated contract spread COVID people, can't vaccinated. Anything less staying home much possible posing risk others. Stay home, selfish plague like saying, ‚ÄúI able drink drive, willing risk harm myself. shouldn‚Äôt criticize so.‚Äù

It's like saying drinking driving something; two things time fact. deliberate actions, absence action. Massive difference.  mean? We've known months Delta hits much harder. Even accounting every metric including age comorbidities (or absence of), much higher likelihood sending someone hospital, ICU, morgue, top transmissible.

Dr. Fisman, Canada, published paper long ago also: mean, generally Delta much worse original wild type. less terrifying vaccinated, (and LOT younger adults good health - exact group people shocked see show ICUs now), vaccinated weaker immune system due reasons like older age, threat. Praise Hay-zooooos! stop them? idiots represent ""community"".   UK vaccinating U16's. vaccine approved age 12+.

Personally I'm worried *doom* variant (though possible guess) much constantly rolling barrage new variants slice dice immunity keep us rolling mud forever. 
 
If think last half-century that's outlier. rest human history (**all** it) people died infections disease left right. Especially vulnerable, obviously. 
 
Maybe that's we're heading now. Back old ways learning live tons sickness death. Go Gators!!!  stunned went Florida Disney first time. sulphur smell/taste water blindsided believe one mentioned sites/subreddits/etc looked plan first trip.  really banking 3rd boosters getting us latest data Israel great. Rt may still know data still preliminary can't count boosters yet.. sure comparing country city relevant. Israel multiple cities 70% vaccinated, many bad Delta outbreaks.  Oh no. gonna do?!??!  can't write anything since given actual numbers. What's numerator denominator percentages refer original post?

All work overall. mean like UK? Delta peak drop, *steadily rising* again? 
 
What we're seeing Delta pushing way slowly vaccinated population. Rt 1, positive slope growth curve. dramatic unvaccinated population obviously still *up*. 
 
This we're going see vaccinated countries. huge sharp Delta surge infects basically every single unvaccinated person. shallower curve *keep* growing continues feed vaccinated population. 
 
The sooner people realize dread implies, sooner start formulate answers. right we're phase people still denial it. said anything masks shots? Except Israel... 50 percent vaccinated +60 range. Source. Npr last 24 hours. fuck sakes, shit ever end? get drink, take mask off...this lunacy. going parabolic soon. bad app really sucks. record vaxed work state...sick crap. even appointments get vaxed sending vaccine notices get vaxxed.

At point bother anything? bar open vector...the stadiums vectors...

Being vaccinated used passport vector. damn problem supposed do.

I rather fed vaccine checks. terrible blunder tell vaccinated people go maskless...we tried experiment providing good data.

We know do, it. vaccinated hope get booster next month. can't treat vaccinated people non vectors, work way.

Business usual killing usual.   Well well well consequences actions... think ever ""on books"", reason be, even prior Oslo, though Israel's involvement everyday life population obviously changed following Oslo. general population areas occupation never considered part population occupying country, unless territory annexed.  think people lean sometimes-used official definition ""mild"" case anything hospitalization. really misleading definition lay person, cases really going feel anything CLOSE mild sufferer.   article really breakthrough infections, serious breakthrough infections. 

As far anecdote goes: reports long covid breakthrough infections hitting whole families showed covid positive subreddit long made news. cases, noticed frequent reports people established reddit identities seemingly reason lie. start seeing lots posts vaccinated people talk hospitalized, definitely get worried, seen all.  clinical trials like this?

edit: nvm, article, suck firm applied authorization ZyCoV-D July 1, based efficacy rate 66.6% late-stage trial 28,000 volunteers nationwide.

Im GA stupid too. company mandated vaccine, weekly testing option. It‚Äôs get vaccinated leave. medical religious exemptions I‚Äôve heard, need solid exemption fill paperwork hr. 

I thought couldn‚Äôt legally? care, I‚Äôm vaccinated think others too. would wise already known two Pfizer ones knew couldn‚Äôt get Moderna one. lying point wouldn‚Äôt worked might try today.

Edit: didn‚Äôt know going CDC recommends cross brands. Yeah..... ain't giving money.....   it‚Äôs bit easier fire them. People still stock food essentials two weeks.

Those doses expire See page 10: encourage everyone read full report; see meta-analysis many studies, including REACT CONVALESCENCE studies. IMO best collection evidence long covid right now. Hey, fair myself, vaccine wasn‚Äôt available got COVID took horse paste. Although took normal human amount. also suggest not-insignificant number people get job requires it, trigger large number employers.

I'm super familiar American insurance system could health insurance providers also ""mandate"" vaccine? I'm talking like raising premiums offering deduction vaccinated?

Not saying would curious legality  Can't tell unvaxxed looking first Moderna shot? shouldn‚Äôt getting downvoted. vaccines worked great COVID made. COVID changed vaccines become disappointment. Hopefully third dose helps. Yeah dare go enjoy life getting vaccinated.  water rationing. Anti-vax waiters waitresses sound worse anti-vax nurses doctors o.0 Thats science works. Although human brains evolved infer based already know, practice considered poor science. evidence giving vaccine 12 year olds, saying whether safe not. Even though brains go: 12 yrs basically 13yrs probably fine; science says: trials 12 yrs finished evidence yet thus cannot draw conclusion. 

Scientific thinking actually works differently human reasoning. really good enabled us make many advancements knowledge, also people understand processes scientific advancement means end anti vaxxers stuff like that. ""2020 two"" indeed...  Native communities good job vaccinations? tribes Washington done excellent job vaccines keeping areas closed visitors. One passing remark subdividing numbers age ... ages static. cases indexed DoB, people one age bracket, might advance next age bracket reports. apply cases vaccinations. Deaths, however, age death. Polls wrong awfully lot tRump crowd.  found word funny. guess ""lock down"" mean different things Asia vs RoW.  feel like risk profile changed since Delta entered game. felt pretty confident could keep son getting (he‚Äôs 3) alpha floating around breakthrough cases rare. husband work patient facing jobs healthcare, even though isn‚Äôt daycare now, much easily bring home.

I expecting see lots mandatory vaccination requirements, lot people getting fired, good reason. Almost one wearing masks public transport UK. trains broken air conditioning cabin ventilation coupled sealed windows, they're basically Covid-19 incubating machines.

Having said people die rabid anti-vaxxers, really care. Pfizer moderna appear basically within ‚Äúmargin error‚Äù other‚Äôs test results. Either one fine get, implement technology. 

This may mean Pfizer got testing done quicker, happens first one getting full approval love country there, damn backwards. expect us eat? Essential services still operating.

These people diseased knows else have? Read article, talk it

‚ÄúIf get infected, vaccinated helps. good news among Israel's serious infections Thursday week, according Health Ministry data, nine times serious cases among unvaccinated people age 60 (178.7 per 100,000) among fully vaccinated people age category, little double number serious infections among unvaccinated people under-60 crowd (3.2 per 100,000) among vaccinated age bracket.

The bad news, doctors say, half Israel's seriously ill patients currently hospitalized fully vaccinated least five months ago. 60 years old comorbidities. seriously ill patients unvaccinated mostly young, healthy people whose condition deteriorated quickly.

Israel's daily average number infections nearly doubled past two weeks increased around tenfold since mid-July, approaching numbers Israel's peak winter. Deaths increased five June least 248 far month. Health officials say currently 600 seriously ill patients hospitalized, warn cannot handle 1,000 serious infections time.‚Äù  ‚ÄúTwo weeks stop spread‚Äù

‚ÄúJust wait vaccine‚Äù

‚ÄúLiterally everyone must vaccine won‚Äôt work‚Äù

‚ÄúVaccines don‚Äôt offer full protection‚Äù

‚ÄúVaccinated people need stay home stop spread‚Äù

Honestly fuck this. Sounds like texas governor managing university. booster shots exactly vaccines modified better handle current variants? recall correctly, flu vaccines updated annually US. family:

‚ÄúThen should‚Äôve done home wasted time coming in‚Äù Good you. time stop coddling people deny dying. point go one sites videos Italy people choking pink vomit, gasping dying COVID.  pediatric ICU‚Äôs filled kids Covid would say otherwise

Not mention risk long Covid kids something like 20% even mild cases What? They're putting *chlorine* body? That's poison!!!  Second shot Moderna ass 12 hours after. next 12 hours sucked lot. thrid day felt little off, fine God, that's awful.. really think timing vaccinations. Israel vaccinated people earlier UK believe, hit delta right lot vaccinated hitting 5 month mark. UK took longer vaccinate right?  It‚Äôs poison it‚Äôs horse deworming gel. said wouldn‚Äôt eat shit. going important one us best convince loved ones get vaccinated. Especially live South Mid-West. gets stated lot 2020 anymore. retailers requiring masks customers vast majority states requiring masks either. Remember even Texas Alabama mask mandate last year point, that's happening year.

Basically, gonna individual take free effective vaccine likely keep hospital. complete lack private business mandates customers year, nothing stopping covid positive cousin spreading covid day Walmart without mask. Private companies local governments stepping intensity like last year, sadly put feet individual.  hope gets real help needs, hope held accountable fraud, lives put risk harm death. Perpetual danger IMO overly dramatic way describe it. Even delta waining immunity, risk worst outcomes Covid drastically reduced vaccine.

For example, 1,246 deaths fully vaccinated people Covid; comparison, 9,000 people average died every day 2020, pandemic. small possibility poor outcomes Covid getting vaccinated, lot inherent risks living life, Covid top list.

If unvaccinated course, maybe different story. Tremendous news. Appreciate sharing me. helpful Dude think it‚Äôs 4 India alone. Shit got medieval, funeral pyres streets bodies floating rivers. data studies correlation? antibody response something study lab easy measure. takes months studying large population really know effectiveness. happened variants (South African, Delta, etc) first found. measured lower antibody response similar vaccine effectiveness. thing. going throw read [study says literally nothing masking efficacy.

Basically, defines ""high risk exposure"" exposures healthcare workers/patients wearing masks, finds -- healthcare institution instituted mask requirement -- fewer high-risk exposures. miracle!

There legitimate observational data masks, this.... ain't I‚Äôm surprised wasn‚Äôt Rick roll least pre-delta, completely aymptomatic people substantially less contagious. Viral loads much, much lower asymptomatic people studies secondary attack rates within households found much less transmission. Reminds images park benches office building steps designs look like raised nails homeless sleep there; taking non-verbal cue. two correspond nature all.

Logically, claiming similar amount expected influence partner's decision making. Regardless physical afraid die catch Covid. 

Death rates low, fear it. Long covid understood could significant consequences. Geriatric studies shown 9 point IQ drops long covid suffers. Early studies covid show substantial increases neurological disorders covid (more doubling incidents Parkinsons, knows many asymptomatic vaccinated people walking free unknowingly spreading Delta right now!

Almost certainly millions.  stands benefit financially use Regeneron suddenly makes sense would want many people sick possible.  said conversation another platform. saying family vaxed earliest possible opportunity. Hell, got standby drove another city get weeks scheduled time (many shows cancelations).

I noted every single drug take laundry list possible negative... possibly fatal side effects...

Hell, drug years ago permanent loss fine motor skills, ability talk permanent Tardive Dyskinesia.....I still took drug.....trying treat another condition. 

Vaccines same....a tiny portion population negative reactions... may fatal reactions complications...but risks low compared trying prevent.

I screamed at, cursed out, pm'd hate messages....that troglodite, anti vax misinformation spreader deserved die horrible death...

Lol....calm down...you honestly discuss risks medication......and can't, understand them.... Darwinism alive well. ü§£üòÇü§£ ‚ÄúGet vaccinated get back normal‚Äù huh? I'll let know feel later on. Midnight est 12 hours. far feel tiny bit blah also pretty hot outside today apartment warm Moderna mild second. 48 hours low grade fever, aches, chills. Arm little sore besides feel back normal now. NY/NJ weeks back mask wearing seems norm inside matter go. I‚Äôm Ohio, masks becoming taboo.  Tough.Other countries actually take covid seriously. Reasonable article, bad headline. got first dose Pfizer Monday also covid last winter. vaccine made question contracted covid again; fever, chills, muscle aches, brutal. lasted 12 hours, thankfully. wonder us feel effects first, second, all. I‚Äôm pretty nervous second.  And, course, people saying 6-12 feet alpha info, delta need even further.  least avoided Corona.

The beer brand, virus. course new variant would Florida. Can‚Äôt wait unmasked unvaccinated kids get together. fine, effective shorter interval. Never Negotiate Terrorists. Me, Mississippi Poison Control employee: ""New phone, dis?"" Load bunk all, viral loads high now, 1 asymptomatic person room superspreader breathing room. Probably low risk cook infecting you, server, yes. droplets need go floor. Takes 3 hours minimum exhalation. anything, dividers prevent cross-circulation neighboring tables. Drafts aircondition cleaning air.

Dine outside, distanced, away large amounts conversation adds droplets air.

It's safe eat due taking mask around people quarantined household, words. 650,000 people country died plane crashes year, imagine would make think twice taking plane ride. people despicable selfish. seems fit bill. Dehydration headaches easily fixed. emergency use, yes. expect Pfizer fully approved adults next week.

What going say is? use another talking point. Oh they're still taking HCQ preventative dewormer treatmeant. There's prepper used follow spiraled Qanon stuff, tells people get stuff. Also promotes Vitamin preventative...i think that's another thing blame deaths on. Like someone doesnt comorbidities say ""well vitamin level?""...which smart grift think cus pretty much everyone low Vitamin reliable coincidence.

I stop listening. people think point future docs telling people get vaccinated brought crimes humanity like nazis Nuremberg trials. super messed up. 

It's shame cus guy knew grow sorts really cool plants...üòí...now talks Vaccine Murder state control sheeple...its grift. long enough time convince people safe? Shouldn‚Äôt existing testing/trials, 4.88 billions vaccinated enough? Considering long term side affect getting it.
Also different FDA trial vs existing trial? differently? FDA extended longer trial? give info that? Antibody neutralization huge correlation prevention infection. jumping gun far. Moderna doses already paid for. 

But yeah. Stating definitive wrong. downvoted? You‚Äôve stated truth.. COVID poses small risk children. get moderna pfizer? side effects third shot similar second?  making babies extent do, you‚Äôre breeder. It‚Äôs interesting anti maskers anti CoVid vaccine people maintain right freedom mask vaccinate intolerable others want right freedom mask vaccinate. Definitely. taking anyone seriously rest life I‚Äôm going need know behaved time lol Tell know herd immunity without telling know herd immunity is.  Check images rally. Alabama heard exercising? happens condition population accept lower lower wages, increased inflation increase services goods‚Ä¶ also get scammed going college willingly entering insurmountable amounts debt. 

At point, instead drive fight ‚Äúfor greater good‚Äù ever think themselves. Why? survive.  saw coming, America health system. can't facepalm hard enough  Yea, young unfortunately. I'm conversation 60+ year old diabetic cancer survivor who's overweight sedentary lifestyle get vaccine think risk perfectly healthy ""I get sick often really good immune system."" I'm wits end. foremost, vaccinated, still wear mask public, avoid gatherings stay home possible.

I'm glad part. here's question you: critical people vaccinated unmasked attending large gatherings? Would tell wear masks stay home? call out, call ""selfish 5 year-olds"" go lengths you? wish large gatherings like music concerts canceled? people hold attend large gatherings right selfish perspective? vocal notion want much anyone else kid get back big parties get togethers. way happens squash virus much possible.

It's pretty much endemic virus now. can, best, get vaccinated, help mitigate chances serious illness hospitalization -- would recommend anyone feels like they're serious risk. likely never live world simply can't get spread COVID. basically waiting arbitrary point time decide ""it's OK"" (which people seems right now). wrong? ""this over"" look like you? vaccination age? unfortunate going right south mid west. Mask mandates bars etc one thing would really issue school mask mandates?? Yet, are. Yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure got alpha back January delta recently. symptoms don‚Äôt know wha else could explain random food especially meat smells rancid now. would punch holes literally every aspect ‚Äúargument‚Äù. would subsequently melt told get Johnson Johnson shatters badly want believe. think exact data you‚Äôre asking still researched.

Could lot younger patients hospitals undiagnosed pathologies comorbidities? Conditions unaware make risk? don‚Äôt know. Doctors don‚Äôt seem explanation either.

I think we‚Äôre gonna wait bit longer specific details.

As hospital admissions age last weeks compare data previous waves, think find databases individual territories jurisdictions. could look info later, knowledge find regions outside Canada limited. Netherlands, look adult population 18), [85% least one vaccination, 75% fully number fully vaccinated adults reach 85% pretty soon, probably grow beyond (about 8-10% adult population want (or cannot) vaccinated). glad approval near. help turn tide vaccine hesitant Worse that. Users reliant going cold turkey results death within days. basically three ways pandemic - Vaccines (everyone's immune, pandemic ends), masks (lower infection rates, pandemic ends), restrictions keep people apart (lower infection rates, pandemic ends). one wants restrictions. blame them. we're left vaccines masks. know certain number people can't get vaccine medical reasons small minority. vaccination rate right like 80-90% (and supply get there) even arguments masks more. pick one things.

You‚Äôre 18 months I‚Äôm fucking sick it. Thanks. Shit take. ....It's Mississippi, wonder Sunshine State suppose good news FDA aiming fully approve Pfizer next wekk.  No, seemed totally normal time election. again, DeSantis seemed like fairly tame moderate time too. didn‚Äôt really go deep end pandemic started. Actually, tastes sweet. It‚Äôs like salty sweet, there‚Äôs that. getting information? Wrong. TONS young people breakthrough cases colleges.    90% people hospital unvaccinated. 90% unvaccinated people end hospital. It‚Äôs distressing thought would full grown adult suddenly idea foods like anymore. Bigger, consider much south bonkers thought everyone taking shit parasites? don‚Äôt think realize many people immune suppressing drugs lol. way means deaths door step. let vaccines go waste citizens entitled dismissive extreme privilege. sure let‚Äôs keep jabbing selfishly people worldwide losing livings, dying begging it. America gotten rich abusing world claiming moral authority. weak think CDC better grip situation WHO.

Lol   Murica: Challenge accepted! Misinformation they're mostly susceptible appeals first place. want hear. appreciate posting report. I've scheduled third shot next week, appears (and correct I'm wrong) they're still debating 100mg 50mg booster dose? 

Because right now, regular dose 100mg, would one get next week. 

What think do? That's entirely correct. unvaccinated male 85 30% chance death gets covid. recently vaccinated male approx 90% less chance. still means vaccinated male 85 3% chance dying get covid - great going somewhere definitely get covid. bad reasons? following closely.  Yeah can't exactly get angry thorough cautious kids trials. 

Imagine jumped gun vaccine harmed children? hard wait, think ultimately right let trials play full full confidence vaccine children. I'm wondering around implies temporary stop 2 authorized vaccines. 

If Moderna fully approved Pfizer is, technical point view (more practical), ""make sense"" keep administer even though fully approved vaccine? Let's forget COVID, Covid vaccines came almost together stuff. could offered one two drugs, one fully approved one EUA providing clear benefits ones approved drug already has, would ever pick EUA drug? even important, would doctor even prescribe it?

So far vaccines ""equal"", Monday first fully approved vaccine USA (and maybe West), one three. 

I'm suspecting USA would put Moderna JJ among donation doses since ""need"" less while, I'm wondering well EUA vaccines still administered approved one already exists. Consider declares end new EUA Covid vaccines probably, since full applications considered (unless heavily different variants?) significant seeing Los Lobos right moment this. vaccinated. I'm actively thinking ways get booster. I'm also looking study RSV immunization, supposed help us old folks. I'll give call Monday, see get in, get paid too. I'll ask regular flu shot problem heading big three letter study popped up. Now, him...thats another story. wish could get hold j j plunge him. Sigh. He's one elderly c.o.p.d, me.

A months ago, people laughing Chile 
using China's vaccine, cases continued spike up. Chile persisted 
in vaccinating people. Chile last laugh, least now. Chile's daily cases 700 now, compared 7000 cases two months ago. 

Same thing happened UAE, actually close 1k daily cases,  
neighbor Israel similar size population close 6k daily cases.  
Sino vaccine effective ones cheaper 
more portable, making vaccine accessible people. well slipperiest slope i've seen recently know is. Almost 5 **billion** doses administered worldwide (yes it‚Äôs mix different vaccines it‚Äôs still staggering amount safety data individual vaccine)

But yeah knows it‚Äôs safe? Oh god, DeSantis would probably send national guard shut airports Florida airlines start requiring vaccinations. apparently Florida's cases gone somewhat, though hospitalizations still going up. Granted, know, Florida reporting data unusual way. now, deaths (*reported* deaths, mind you) decreasing. Exactly. It‚Äôs better take time super thorough, rush issue show cause vaccine hesitancy resistance. Ha. excuses then? Says person contributes nothing ad hominem debate. adults talking.  shared friend friend previously made ""it's approved"" excuse, asked whether he'd get shot was, dodged weaved like crazy bunch meme bullshit. I'm fun one, cause he's avoiding giving answer, started shit speaking negatively towards mutual friend who'd posted something favor getting vaccine. I'm enjoying watching idiot squirm ineffectually sling meme bullshit avoid answering question created. No, aren‚Äôt. 

-Canada. go long time. Covids highly infectious, mutates relatively fast. probably remain endemic short-mid term. 

What happen acceptance covid. UK we're back normal. think theres acceptance covid kill slightly flu levels foreseable future.

This shit insane. Seriously, AAP said it‚Äôs needed.

Full approval clear shadow doubt make moot ongoing vaccination campaigns.

I'm frugal nature, money yours, choose cheaper option. late, news story last Tuesday. [DeSantis top donor invests Covid drug mean, anti-mask Republican governors seem trouble killing voter base so...maybe it‚Äôs projection? 1.

2. can't compare flu covid one vaccine, huge innoculum size effect. way make claim would infect 1000 unvaccinated kids flu 1000 covid using standardized amount virus, see lives.

3. definitely want covid evolving more, much opportunity let rip among kids.  think NeverCovid realistic position take anymore.

Is anyone actually taking position?  Who?  see comments like lot, never see anyone (in position authority) talking ""get vaccine *never* get COVID!"". No, cdc data, compared usa doeant add so.someobe lying  many places making monoclonal antibodies? accidents happen.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Boosters.

Don't get wrong: think vitally important kids school, educational social reasons. 

It's important, we, country (and states/cities), willing make priority, everything possible make workable. didn't. fear workable result. news driving 8 month booster recommendations everyone now. truly high effectivity still, would need boosters. can't imagine crazy sounds european u protocols shootings school!!

Anyway, use u, know cases breakthrough infections, mild except one fully asympthomatic. Ages ranging early 30s mid 40s. Different vaccines. Assuming doesnt spread via food u order/eat? China studying food contamination, hear ZERO media it. risks probably low, point even u encase bubble, world goes flames, ur screwed anyway.

Here's example: lets say live Florida refuse leave house. Safe? Sure! u break bone medical issue! what?

Is hospital overrun w Covid patients? u see doctor? u catch Covid hospital w patients groaning hallways ran rooms? Kudos this, nobody's gonna comment username? There's enormous amount uncertainty long term damage Covid even kids. could rare, could common. parents would lot anxiety that? know this? thought CDC said can‚Äôt test variants? special test specific reason hospital settings, nursing homes, etc.

So maybe mostly dependent last dose was? never said anything disparaging vaccine. said sad people rightly skeptical government agency bad track record safety shady relationships big business treating agency like sacred cow made (as I've said multiple times) **right** call (this time least). reaching hard draw connection never even implied one people.

Designed livestock could mean dosage large animals humans. 

Either way plenty commenters seem think it‚Äôs strictly drug animals. There's inherent assumption statement many/most people Florida vaccinated. Certain counties Florida may look decent, many many rural counties low (i.e. piss poor) vaccine uptake. COVID/Delta circulating heavily here. [posted](/r/FloridaCoronavirus/comments/p8ucx5/florida_vaccination_numbers_from_cdc_as_of/) current vaccination numbers 67 Florida counties. rural north Florida county currently 38.9% (12+, partially vaccinated) 29.4% (12+, fully vaccinated).

Yesterday pick prescription one local pharmacies (don't ask, I'm going mention one). normally 6-7 people working pharmacy (on different shifts). currently 2 staff (one pharmacist one tech). others COVID. 2 bare minimum operate with. deeply concerned, two people personal friends.

The DeSantis administration's statement read part, ""The Florida Department Education begin withhold state funds, monthly basis, amount equal 1/12 total annual compensation school board members voted impose unlawful mask mandates district demonstrates compliance.""..... 
And yet, there's Ron DeSantis, suggested week mask protections ""not proven effective,"" reality notwithstanding..... 
Federal intervention remains possibility. President Biden spoke White House yesterday, announcing he'd directed Education Secretary Miguel Cardona ""use authority, legal action, appropriate,"" deter states banning universal masking classrooms. 
""We're going sit governors try block intimidate educators protecting children,"" Democrat said. White House Chief Staff Ron Klain echoed sentiment morning. 
Update: NBC News confirmed afternoon U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona White House officials urging local school administrators Florida -- facing loss income defying state rules barring mask mandates -- hold line. anti-maskers anti-vaxxers screaming freedom time feels petty authoritarian This. Herd immunity happens within *herds*, whole population. Herds densely-connected networks within city. 80% people herd get immunity (vaccines natural), transmission stop herd final 20% get infected. 20% later connected another herd easing restrictions school starting, etc, get infected another wave. observed first half 2021 many Northern countries.

There journal articles model dynamic. try dig one anyone cares. Pretty sure least 3000 troll accounts local news pages alone.  No. people wouldn‚Äôt taking jest, there's grain truth there.

They're afraid virus would prefer avoid it, can't admit wrong important thing. That's keep going rabbit hole faced new information.

So think given something could construe alternative vaccine (even functionally identical), would take pronounce moral victory.

Maybe antibody shot that, unless get delta becomes available. real prize eyeing 2024. He‚Äôll win ease 2022, assume. daughter says chickenshit. horseshit, dogshit. Specifically chickenshit capitalism. becaus populism. go-to response idiots like better read back Tylenol bottle, aspirin bottle, ibuprofen bottle, medicine take. Side effects galore.

Too many people didn‚Äôt even pass General Biology think know career scientists what‚Äôs safe isn‚Äôt. irritating thing ever.    card good proxy undateable. Cases: 1028

Hospitalized: 396

Deaths: 20-25 deaths average per day Stellar comment. Holy shit thought kind one thing people actually distributing shit?  specific day anything? One person's astronomical might another person's average. descriptive term like useless conveys information person's opinion significant unknown number is.

If I'm supposed care many cookies someone ate, say ""ate insane amount,"" I'm still left knowing nothing all. May Biden ordered investigation origins Covid, including lab leak theory. Investigators supposed report back 90 days, mean end month. think wrong. Well explained! Nah that's government excuse pushed. buy anywhere near enough AZ us vaccinated now. little amount we've nearly used rest used people's 2nd doses. Even NSW outbreak nearly getting used despite narrative Australians hesitant get vaccinated. I'm saying scientists things properly, need check they're claiming effectiveness. seems did, good you!

I'm gonna lookup sources (saved comment) yet (painkillers). Everybody pays public schools, even don‚Äôt kids. societal benefit educated populace. isn‚Äôt like Walmart taking money shopping target. Instead, it‚Äôs like taxed road city don‚Äôt drive on. Saves time! waste night money someone isn‚Äôt page. Opposite true too! Many people reasons unvaccinated I‚Äôm sure one wants spend whole night person badgering aren‚Äôt vaccinated. 

This shouldn‚Äôt issue upfront like someone‚Äôs sexual orientation. There‚Äôs plenty fish sea doubt someone wants purposely date fishes find wrong ones. Same. actors say???? projection right say?? SHOCKED hard hold China ""accountable"" everything touch made there. know entire world economy depends factories please.  think people trying see ridiculous thing get people take try cure it. Bleach still pretty high list Covid vs science natural selection wins. It‚Äôs like forsythia, can‚Äôt go wrong someone doesn‚Äôt wear seatbelt, they‚Äôre endangering themselves.

even stupid body hitting someone else laying dead street 25m infront cars forcing someone Dodge corpse. abbreviation Florida Fl, Fla.  2018 CLOSE. Florida. Thanks lot. It‚Äôs much appreciated anxious times never got smell taste back, year now. Stuff tastes absolutely vile mostly precautions, virulent strain, poor vaccine uptake vacationing people around world popping ‚Äúfun time‚Äù. multifaceted tsunami unbelieving dictator, mean governor, helm. Absolutely, choice informed individual want live life. No. Next? Another moron wants everybody locked up. Living means dying point. Darwin smiling yet again... what? Oh, absolutely. think adults appraise risk level act accordingly based values wish achieve. friend works bar covid 3 times disagree also think college level education required understand what's going enough make good decisions getting vaxxed. That's something educate people earlier college. 

I know say college specifically people decide reply lol.

But yes, education system needs major reworking everywhere, quality accessibility many thousands got vaccine wearing masks. let vocal minority dictate public policy. hope future. really annoying drag out. I‚Äôm glad hear that. Like said, maybe her. covid isolation really got her. much drastic change academic performance emotional state. praying masks vaccines help classes stay person. Clarification: WANT LIVE LIFE WAY.

I choose take virus seriously order forced live way. path normal via mitigation science, Jesus devil-may-care bravado.

When u dont make ur choices carefully, u leave much room error regret. Others may live freely right now, Im one regret going mask-free crowded bar.

The AIDS epidemic same: completely agree orgies fun promiscuous sex better celibacy. dont agree DYING actions worth recklessness. Especially ur young ur whole life ahead u. yeah, people CHOOSE sex &amp; death, same: believe invulnerable abd/or blessed God... right Death comes knocking shatter delusion. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm asking. social distance thing anymore? hasn‚Äôt 3+ months area. mask mandates change that? memes, care people think me.

But point stands, amongst efforts there, pointless mere greenwashing. believe face value, check credentials facts getting excited. That's I'm saying.

And umbrella answers like make people look dumb IMO.

Like famous late french humourist used say : ""Education (*culture*) like marmalade, less spread it"". lol going poison body, choice- business Well, like March 2020 Australia since COVID starting take there. Australia basically going turmoil accepting they'll deal COVID stay locked indefinitely feasible. Even vaccines, going get much, much worse coming months. New Zealand far behind.  People buying taking horse paste tractor supply though restrictions racist? What?  I'd assume number small DeSantis would screaming every chance got.  We've first many vaccine requirement announcements (indoor events, healthcare workers, state employees, school employees, etc), I'm sure matter time large outdoor events. least hope. Valid, adjacent point think problems speaking moving long covid. got better around 6-7 months. Don‚Äôt lasting symptoms know of. bedbound lost ton weight too

But agree, kind pointless argue people can't arsed use correct abbreviations around longer average redditor alive. Give 2 weeks, cases upward trajectory. Facts. insurance could afford they'd rather let die spend money. true. vaccine mandates important next step. still think mask mandates place then, though. It‚Äôs two weeks. Though pointed incubation Delta four days. Hard, say. state Virginia reports percent COVID deaths vaccinated. Virginia Department Health reports [98.17% COVID deaths state Virginia far people fully Furthermore, 0.0011% COVID deaths Virginia involved fully vaccinated people. 

If anyone vaccinated, hope numbers show vaccines STRONGLY reduce likelihood death. age understanding number things might take out, Covid. parents in-laws got vaccinated, beyond I‚Äôm going try stop living lives years left. Because, I‚Äôm sure know now, Covid going away. acute care. noticed never see antivax acute care staff, always people care patient dies. Fist time Reddit, maybe? Ivermectine horses. even used humans parasites, COVID (by mean prescribed doctor). OMG! taste smell one thing rancid !!! long they'll demanding gun's back. explain ? Yes, French known protests. many countries world barely functioning govts take care citizens. kept masks least majority people vaxxed, might able pull off.

If majority people refuse get vaccinated indefinitely, people mask indefinitely that's problem. Given vaccines may need regular boosters, even important vaccine mandates help give vaccine-hesitant extra push need get vaccinated. bungled saying ""resolves"" though. orange deity would never use pretentious word XD  Plus, interventions, like monoclonal antibodies, effective early covid detection administration. dilly-dallying going hospital can't breathe, really limiting treatment options. 30% cases LA fully vaccinated

Yes, [64% population fully vaccinated](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/vaccine/vaccine-dashboard.htm). 

I've given multiple links suggesting efficacy infection 70% 90%, though concede experts think lower (40%).

All numbers much better zero, vaccine passport policy good one. long cases exploding (and SF, [coming think bars restaurants closed indoor dining. However, make things *safer*, policy that.

By way, masks also 100% effective slowing spread, also silly argument. much better nothing. like vaccination requirements. saw story elsewhere, looks like less 100 people (I think high 70s cases) one required hospitalization people god damned minds. need stop treating get covid. Sorry; sorry. They're keeping shit going. Hope good Bleach. even Trump approved. 'Hurts Good'. I'm hoping vaccines really fully rolled out? We'll see say. Actually, quite do.

Tell [parable man doctor told to, Reddit tells I‚Äôm lying doctor (unless they‚Äôre quack) would suggest that. response didn‚Äôt give reason either. case, genuinely don‚Äôt understand need inject this.  research.  like old screenshot someone listing bunch chemicals asking antivaxer would safe ingesting reply like ""I wouldnt put body"" like chemical makeup apple something. think Ivermectine safe use humans overdose. highly unlikely effect COVID-19. Vaccine gave men larger penis, would anti-vaxxers, world would COVID. past month, people ages 25 49 made 14% COVID deaths state. 29% deaths ages 50 64.

I always find breakdowns annoying. first group twenty-five year gap next group fifteen year gap. 

Similar age groups used since start pandemic. It‚Äôs misleading ultimately get people question data reports. I‚Äôm glad one year lived Kentucky last year. Source numbers. 30% chance death, nursing homes across country would empty. Hell retirement communities FL would nothing death. 


There almost certainty 30% chance death covid 5m+ Americans. Ask doctor maybe? trusting doctor weird thing nowadays? Let die already start caring cases? deaths hospitalizations low fully open economy. think would illegal US, space level care available. also particularly frustrating [the ingredient list vaccines published look up. 

What they're really saying ""No one tell do, even 9f concern collective safety. Long live ignorance... die."" 

Fuck people. insurance can't afford it. works US unfortunately. Right? first ‚Äúget vaccine save grandma won‚Äôt wear mask.‚Äù 

Now it‚Äôs like, never said prevented getting it. Lol, fucking morons. Oh God. I've got stop reading now. lol comment kinda supports antimRNA vaccine group, whoops. That‚Äôs question well believe statistic 99.5% deaths fully vaccinated. would 1194 unvaccinated 6 vaccinated. Let ask then. recently COVID (delta variant). didn‚Äôt get sick. mild symptoms lasted days feel fine. 

Why get vaccinated? That‚Äôs genuine question. didn‚Äôt affect me, doesn‚Äôt prevent spreading/catching it, reason need one? fully vaccinated ge Sure, clearly saying controversial I‚Äôm getting downvoted, transmissibility concerning. sheer number kids susceptible unable get vaccinated super large. kids end exposed completely recover, small percentage kids hospitalized. small percentage big number still big number. Obviously, it‚Äôs going disproportionately affect places lower vaccination rates overall, already record numbers pediatric transmissibility alone changes risk factor. Magnesium!? That's put flares! goal posts wheels waiting news drop ""Lie floor"", surely? actually super-sneaky way Deep State deworm Republicans. Interesting ü§î Better Canada us let spoil explains Instagram. OH BOY! ? severe Sigh.

I believe referring [this misinterpreting it.

It find rich kids average test scores likely go to/graduate college poor kids average test scores. really problematic finding.

However, ABSOLUTELY mean early school ""does shit all"" test scores matter. Indeed, test scores actually meant poor students -- example, 43% poor students above-average math scores 10th grade ultimately graduated college, vs. 13% poor students average scores (pg. 24 linked study).

Students' socioeconomic backgrounds absolutely matter. mean schooling matter Don‚Äôt attend them. Let sing prayers Censor deez nuts Philippines run nurses saying something.

They easy compare.  Give details. hate mowing. live Lower Mainland Canada. getting vaccine indeed business.

You dating them, however, business.

That's like cat well cat-eating wolf, wolf eats cat, shrug say wolf's business. played active part happened getting wolf/dating unvaxed. There's powerful institution society encourages people believe ridiculous self-contradictory things. called religion. person next vaccinated also safe. they‚Äôre not, chosen take risk it‚Äôs me, vaccine immediately available anyone wants it. That‚Äôs point *you* missing. Everyone US option get vaccinated protect themselves. took seriously year. got vaccinated. isn‚Äôt year ago. Again, vaccines extremely effective preventing serious illness covid everyone option get it. That‚Äôs endgame. That‚Äôs ‚Äúthinking others‚Äù. Others need think *themselves* too. Interesting paper please, don‚Äôt believe put want self. animal studies mRNA vaccines? Minorities skeptical due long-standing distrust government doctors. I‚Äôve always expressed qualms using percent tests positive metric since heavily skewed simple things (e.g. symptomatic people testing, leading inflated rate, conversely mass testing certain demographics, colleges testing every student twice weekly, leading undercount))
  
I think metric scientific value looking big picture, without reference testing think pretty worthless always bugged factor tied reopening places, like California, worse 3 factors would chosen determine stage unable shoot it. much bigger would happy   I've met Dr. Dobbs before. He's good man excellent doctor. unfortunately gave ammunition anti-vaxxers early process misspeaking several times reporting incorrect rates, later retracted. 

It's tough here. Good you! Enjoy it!  bring back masks everyone everything. go hospital believe science medical system urges get vaccinated?

Those anti vaxxers stay home self medicate. trust system, go treatment. America, ok?  Go Ducks saddest modern day form natural selection. grandfather this. used somewhat progressive. grandmother passed away went full dive conservative vortex.

Breakthroughs ""rare"" much virus circulating. Even vaccines longer 95% effective preventing infection, still ~70% effective. also compounds. everyone vaccinated, first vaccinated person needs get infected *then* another vaccinated person needs catch them. probability greatly reduced.

In addition, vaccinated people clear viral loads much faster unvaccinated, meaning infectious long, meaning less likely vaccinated person bar/restaurant spread disease.

Vaccination mandates bars restaurants absolutely still make sense, driving policy.  tyranny claiming arbitrary capricious right freedom avoid responsibility recurring theme. claim vague unsupportable. responsibility clear. I'm waiting long time studies.

How long? Genuinely curious. year safety efficacy data phase 2/3 trials Pfizer/BioNTech point.  way, think crack open new statistic: ""people vaccinated past 12 months"". might people got vaccinated first round get booster. immunity people virus would start waning. point looking ""people fully vaccinated"" statistics might give wrong impression. know many still punchy protection, like stale cola. health care workers return work 6 weeks, symptoms like loss taste smell severe fatigue.

Unfortunately doubt ever happen. anti vaxxers ones voted the... questionable leaders. likely want protect base keep is, first come first serve. Damn; missed one removeddit working well lately. remain isolation PCR results in! I'll give one thing: FDA infallible, make mistakes.

As one example personal me, approved Ciprofloxacin fluoroquinolones past antibiotic without warnings, led doctors relying prescribing heavily, since linked sorts significant severe side effects, may actually caused Gulf War Syndrome many soldiers deployed Gulf FDA since multiple times major warnings added drug. ""The FDA first added Boxed Warning fluoroquinolones July 2008 increased risk tendinitis tendon rupture. February 2011, risk worsening symptoms myasthenia gravis added Boxed Warning. August 2013, agency required updates labeling describe potential irreversible peripheral neuropathy (serious nerve got peripheral neuropathy, possibly issues. urologist said ""I'm prescribing antibiotic"" zero warnings worst assumed I'd fucked gut flora taking pills. taking first pill feeling tingling arms legs. took four pills intense nerve tingling body, including face, made connection, called doctor, switched. kept feeling neuropathy seven years afterwards. neuropathy pretty much gone though, finally, crazy pills terrible reaction.

That said, got Pfizer vaccine soon could. far concerned Covid-19, time eligible anyway (April) tons people already vaccine pretty clear immediate side effects would be, definitely minor. 

But used default always blindly trusting whatever doctors health organizations told do, learn hard way little skeptical tell definitely research anything recognize that's prescribed recommended now. doctor recommend Saxenda day help bring weight down, I'm still fence it, even though FDA approved there's serious praise online people taken it, there's still concerned about:

Israel tourism currently (Florida wide open country 330 million people), Florida twice large percent population 65, Israel much COVID restrictions, cases started peak Florida peaked yet Israel.


To point moderate-to-low disparity vaccination rate explains disparity hospitalizations absurd. There's many better examples vaccines working Florida anti-vax hell hole - vaccinated 30 states. South Korea relatively wealthy country? wouldnt thought would need donations There's tons meds there, wrong? avoiding food shedding mass, call coping got links polls?

Haven't able find polls info like since March. wonder long term social impacts going re: huge difference outcome pandemic white collar workers others. white collar workers, life got better many ways. clear, plan wear masks sanitize groceries rest life? that's case betting man, money would trip rather brought home school. Lol bruh, goal post? ALREADY got vaccinated, that‚Äôs it, goal stopped there.

Now people want raise efficacy third jab exact vaccine got before, different first two, *can*, nobody forcing anyone take boosters.

Now new variant pops that‚Äôs somehow worse Delta, science studies show something needed we‚Äôll adjust deal comes. Watch Fox News want spoilers conversation anti-vaccine people next week. No, adult population matters vast majority people getting hospitalised due covid adults children.  ""Bronson elected platform opposing Assembly former mayor‚Äôs COVID mitigation measures. first day office, declared masks optional city buildings."" 

Looks like got exactly voted for. Mayor trying lead protect them, conspiracy theorist.  son‚Äôs school says otherwise. Can‚Äôt wait see many covid cases around start. Ugh  Billions    Well easy get it.

See FDA research studies could make conscience decision giving approval.

And FDA approval means safe considered something humans bodies. people claiming vaccine safe hushed longer able claim unsafe harmful vaccine.

Further making Facebook ""Doctors"" 100% incorrect vaccine part scheme disrupt humanity. That‚Äôs good news. Doesn‚Äôt matter much me, trust approved. want them
to approved anyone holding get shot. got better! people couldn‚Äôt refused something easy; continue virus. Thanks idiots. people going rush water lawns

I would say silly since rained every day summer, also neighbors run sprinklers every night anyway. Uh what? need treatments. That‚Äôs really end thing. deaths negligible get back real normal. course vaccines proven every one took jab wouldn‚Äôt really situation. that‚Äôs problem, everyone vaccinated. vaccine highly effective treatment that‚Äôs better vaccine. hope day law firms start suing Fox News hosts saying dangerous work bad like Dominion did.

Stupid stupid.

You make laws communism, especially democratic presidency     Gotta love collective denial shunning ""alarmists"". notice soon enough... won't.  ""People Receiving Dose 1"" toggle top. Note recent days incomplete data.

You could ask thing - would Republican administration kill voter base?

That's part comment replying to. realize kids vector. fine, vast majority vulnerable population access vaccine mitigate risk.

People cannot get vaccine medical reasons kinda fucked, they're kinda fucked regardless - COVID stay, eventual exposure inevitable. Anyone thinks pandemic would end less 3 years is/was kidding Sure thing- would guess smoking eating substance similar smoking eating different substances. 60% US workers covered self-funded healthcare plan. means don‚Äôt actually health insurance way think it. Instead, employers collect premiums put escrow account pay employee‚Äôs healthcare bills pocket.  

‚ÄúInsurance‚Äù companies like Aetna administer plans, money coming directly employer‚Äôs pot. Therefore best interest large employers reduce medical costs employees. Mandating vaccines purely cost saving decision.

**If refused get vaccine, valid medical reason so, reason new wave mask mandates, reason hospitals overloaded, reason people DYING truckload. GET. FUCKING.

Easy, isn‚Äôt safe care. want adults get back underpaying job people buy stuff. less buying stuff kids aren‚Äôt school. right on! So... we're looking sample Opposite Guy, I'm going say yes government stones say anything days. criminal first word came mind, especially paragraph article:

I wouldn‚Äôt wish human being. Disney stop watering grass/plants then? economy never run peak, free economics means always run close failure possible. that's cheapest. Saw poll said 66% still won't. know answer. But, approved, many places, jobs, schools mandate vaccine lot less pushback, law side mandatory vaccination too. Pediatric trials don‚Äôt disease endpoints adult trials did. Endpoint antibody levels similar adult dosing, safety. trials gave way fewer subjects tens thousands original trial. Fine jail them.

It's contagious chicken pox nearly evereyone pre-vaccine exposed.

The vaccines stop delta transmission large portion population unvaccinated. children across board vaccinate, even worse.

You exposed get COVID. think underestimating chance. something unvaccinated people (incl. family) reason misunderstand statistics prevelant contagious COVID right remain endemic.

I like, neat. We‚Äôre world people taking zombie fiction seriously. Hate usual comments this, people saying come new excuse. Sure, will. gets 5-10% Americans get, either directly, companies/colleges mandating it, huge living fear, we're also going exposing germs there.

The thing get this, however, COVID literally less dangerous flu vaccinated. take substantial precautions benefit\* previous years' flu seasons, now?

I guess don‚Äôt trust Trump‚Äôs vaccine.    ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Yeah, time locked must've recognized virus transmitted already communities. cases popping now. 5? thought testing children young 6 months. Vaccinated people: ""great people get shots

Unvax'd: ""it got approved fast trust it, I'm going huff jenkem Facebook says so"" Yes love sure Sam coming window? *Sam entrance noise* don‚Äôt need one. Yeah real. Also RN. husband (an MD) got mine late December. 

Health insurance suspect. buy marketplace. late FDA? responsible deaths thousands  live planet Earth STILL understand vaccines simply *prevent getting severe case* (which way worth considering longterm effects covid least 20% infected), stop getting infected? flu vaccine thing. still get sick, maybe 3 days instead 2 weeks. STILL CONFUSING. Pfizer developed vaccine? headline actually mean ""FDA aiming give full approval BionTechs COVID-19 vaccine Monday"" ???

Pfizer logistics ... Ohhh. Sorry see video read article read it, say anything claimed did. part gave idea?  may game changer. know many people it‚Äôs ‚Äúfully vaccinated.‚Äù talked coworker tonight sounds like they‚Äôll definitely get moment it‚Äôs ‚ÄúFDA approved.‚Äù get Virus Info TikTok. that‚Äôs sad. virus wants wants. hopefully 3rd dose helps. Yes, elderly immunocompromised get much protection vaccination. breakthrough cases serious (more mild illness) kinds people.

And children 12 yet eligible vaccine.

This care people get vaccinated.  Lol imagine dense ‚Äúturn around‚Äù  elaborate weird appendicitis 4 years ago 12 hours pain told wife needed go er.

My mom commented went heart seem feeling it‚Äôs er time versus pain. Idk honestly, chest paid knew something went also means system capacity, happen *not* COVID but, say, heart attack get serious car accident? Sucks you, resources *would have* saved life tied up. I'm hoping least legitimately waiting, else know wrong use ""FDA finally approved!"" reason get vaccine save face. done malaria drugs panacea this? I've loop taking extra long shower last 6 months straight. free make mistakes want. imagine employers going start mandating though. Healthier population &amp; less viral loads thanks extensive mask usage. can‚Äôt ‚Äúbeat‚Äù Delta. We‚Äôre middle transition pandemic endemic. Yes slow progression good amount there‚Äôs ‚Äúbeating‚Äù covid now. However getting frustrated garbled messaging CDC.

Honestly, that's fair. CDC messaging course pandemic included

What science says.

What think science going say soon one study completed published.

What science said started report filter layers well intended approvals.

What constitutes rational macro-scale public policy. (Like wanted focus PPE availability healthcare workers, even science said individuals would safer wearing masks. led saying masks help.)

And politically driven stuff. people said FDA would take 5-10 years approve going say trust FDA anymore move goalposts. get wrong I'm get happy development, I'm sad time get good news seem able frame context bad. fam January. felt fine, minding business eating ice cream knitting Friday night. 8:30 pm, hit like freight train. Chills, fever, headache. knows long contagious that? fine one minute, sick next.

The good part came it, mild cases. Husband worst, felt terrible like death, kids (14 18) barely symptoms. tested 3 adults house tested positive.

Lemme tell ya, quarantine 5 people pits. in-laws going ‚Äúthe vaccine mark beast‚Äù family moved must skills want. Welcome enjoy stay :) article describes jabs, doses, shows liquid vaccine.

But could crappy article too. 3 pills, massive game changer. can't believe people Florida willing drink clean water, willing exercise rights citizens oppressed clean water, outrage. horribly sick. like solid flu Hahaha define freedom.

I'd say limit lot folks even kids protected hospitals well....Alabama'ing.

They wouldn‚Äôt last 6 months lose here. cause brain damage, always Flu vaccines notorious crappy, covid vaccines proven vastly better even infection. I‚Äôm implying anything. I‚Äôm posting links.

I‚Äôm leaving room go bathroom that‚Äôs it. mom stepdad one dose vaccine, chances it‚Äôs already air still get it? dark knight *rises*  mutations mean Spanish Flu circulates. variant Influenza around nearly century. Influenza mutates every year. Saying Spanish Flu still circulating correct. 

Just Spaniel descended wolf, mean wolves dog park. government health care free all, vaccination rates would even lower would zero incentive take precautions financial reasons. multiple polio vaccines. One prevents infection transmission. One prevents transmission, problem using live virus. vaccines played role eradicating polio. 

If covid shot preventing infection transmission, useless stopping epidemic. least one. Preventing death, creating asymptomatic carriers cannot stop epidemic, could cause infections. swift death host would stop spread. preventing deaths good goal. Even vaccines led cases, would still support vaccination at-risk way prevent severe outcomes. think case: seems vaccines prevent infection. clear prevent transmission Delta breakthrough cases conflicting studies this. prevent transmission preventing cases first place. Maybe boosters allow also prevent transmission definitely.  

Maybe? Lol wtf issue Texas There's lots fake evidence vaccine harmful look it. Yes. Folks absolutely must differentiate Governor (who nothing help spread), Dr. Dobbs (who seems admirable job face impossible task) Yeah I'm going back even require it. Especially working DC, even somehow avoid Covid, never know crazed redneck gonna try come blow us smithereens. wonder paying him.  ""full FDA approval"" process actually called BLA, like emergency authorization called EUA. Here's [quick comparison showing differences, BLA right side. Huh? answered question. Move can‚Äôt handle I‚Äôm sorry, there‚Äôs way someone can‚Äôt even use basic punctuation speaking authority subject like this. bro, u get covid? anyone ELI5 would take long despite already giving out?  surprised became reality. Can't wait anti-vaxx crowd move goal posts. ""Yuh, but, like, tested YEARS, know long-term effects??"" surging? really read anything I'm going around Minneapolis like Florida problem. still wear mask crowded places feel like I'm alone. I'm fully vaxxed scary think things surging here. would difficult draw conclusions small sample size. Eastern Washington siphoning resources Seattle metro? long ago ago looking participants? I‚Äôm gonna guess it‚Äôs late get kids study‚Ä¶ :/ Oh good, brand vaccine control good one. mean they‚Äôre open litigation? Hopefully committee members resign June Alzheimers drug approval going resign approval lot idiots using excuse though (to get vaccinated).  No, cannot 100% certainty.

But expecting society act accordance *most risk averse* person silly standard, would unworkable applied non-COVID situations well.  They‚Äôre open something feel hesitant about, benefit literally us. Let‚Äôs lay-off bit, yeah? encouraging people like poking fun. Time mandate vaccination people want enter buildings. good this. - link work you? Agreed. Given well trials going, poorly delta going, literally impossible vaccine worse disease kids. Waiting EUA unbelievably irresponsible considering many kids get delta fall/winter. beyond frustrating. they're unvaccinated point. vaccinated must allowed live lives. [THAAAAAAANK Fucking finally That's gonna trigger number 2 wave  probably people.We care dying getting seriously sick.From accounts I've seen vaccine preventing that.A booster prevent something less severe seems unnecessary IMO.Best use distribute doses unvaccinated order stop variants. Seems like solid plan couldn‚Äôt possibly backfire, chance danger kids covid. Resume? never stopped  Anecdotal, I‚Äôm pregnant 3 people due month said doctor approved get moderna Pfizer. know that‚Äôs official recommendation yet folks could anywhere. small refraction covid cases world wide going result US schools irresponsible.

Oh, covid plenty negative cognitive effects survivors, including reduced intelligence long term disability. real upside. Thank you, congrats! like understand idea general.  Earlier today received first Pfizer vaccination. several months finally it. get love? Definitely bummed company reversed masking policy... mask vaccinated, everyone wear mask times unless alone private office door closed (which, obv, directors VPs have)

At least reduced required in-office days once/week once/month (and even pointless imho) Yes. also really stupid. sorts shit hitting fan! crazy!! won‚Äôt change thing. ""it's fully approved fast trick people getting it""

Says half country Tuesday you‚Äôre describing cold symptoms, even bad ones, yes still mild case. didn‚Äôt go hospital. breathe.  Won‚Äôt change thing. Hope doubtful. Damn. mandated masks state too? really hard hit Southern Oregon. hospital work 100% capacity last stat saw said 16 bed ICU 27 patients it. ED least half boarders every day we're losing medical staff quitting covid quarantines. really, really bad. Thankfully general public knows hoax. really hoping LOCAL hospital LOCAL doctors started making statements would build trust, sadly, hasn't. We've safe effective vaccine months now, dumdums taking poisonous horse pills... really know. person said taste smell gone four months. came back garlic rotting meat everything certainly don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre infallible, particular advice doesn‚Äôt seem inappropriate. point know there‚Äôs amount waning efficacy certain vaccines third booster shot needed everyone 8 months (but won‚Äôt happening large scale late September sounds like). makes sense advise vulnerable people avoid situation could potentially exposed super high viral load right now. fuck kids vaccine? FDA taking sweet time. Extremely frustrating. difficulty breathing scary stuff even ultimately never goes hospital. hard know lung capacity back normal levels that's happening. GOP *pro votes*. position gets enough votes fair game. Longer fighting masks last, bet. week shut least 50% anti vaxxer. saw brilliant response nurse antiva ""you tell vaccinated know what's know what's IV put arm? push back getting medical care sick."" tragic.

She nurse, fully vaccinated exposed daughter due working Covid ward.

This also goes show incredibly contagious Delta variant is. Went sold concert outdoors week ago, 30,000 people. show proof vaccination recent negative covid test. Maybe 5% people wearing masks, shoulder shoulder hundreds people one point.

Myself wife totally fine (we vaccinated). show ""super spreader event"". Everyone great time peep spreading virus.

Just wanted provide personal experience crowds since there's often lot insight actually going shows right now. People downvoting way you‚Äôre right. Florida‚Äôs vaccination rates people cannot escape realities libraries turned antibody injection sites friends family members put vents stuck understaffed overwhelmed ICUs. It‚Äôs fucked reality think increased prevalence (in unvaxxed groups) addition FDA approval, vaccine passports, job losses due vaccination status get people line. continue dodge vaccines common sense policies slapped huge fines. Yes that‚Äôs shitty way get done don‚Äôt see another way honestly. wouldn‚Äôt mind health insurance revoked idiots either. I'll least start consider it. Biden offer school districts 101% ~~Trump~~ DeSantis withholding. I‚Äôve hesitating get vaccine lack official approval.  Admittedly, I‚Äôm ecstatic see FDA arriving decision officially approve vaccine. like governer put it.

He said something along lines ""we ask businesses mask police vaccine police""

Seems everyone learn lessons hard way. Ultimately matters number kids needing ICU care much hospitals handle. explosion cases still killing kids need ICU beds reasons, cannot get them. Vaccination desperately needed prevent surge kids going school. Also, long term consequences covid simply considering deaths. like botnets / worms go around closing firmware exploits botnets. question mutation risks have? less 10% size COVID fuck knows. thing could infect entire global population (as COVID almost certain do) mutations. sounds like hell.

Abstract

&amp;#x200B;

 
Objective: 
This study conducted evaluate persisting Covid-19-related symptoms cases included study assess cardiac findings order determine impact Covid-19 children‚Äôs cardiovascular health. 
Methods: 
In study, 121 children ages 0-18 Covid-19 evaluated based history, blood pressure values, electrocardiography echocardiography results. findings compared findings control group consisted 95 healthy cases age range study group Covid-19. results evaluated using statistics program, SPSS 21. 
Results: 
There significant difference study group control group terms age, weight, body mass index. clinical symptoms (chest back pain, dizziness, headache, palpitation, fatigue, shortness breath, loss balance, coughing) 37.2% cases persisted least 1 month Covid-19 recovery. Statistically significant differences found systolic blood pressure, left ventricular ejection fraction, relative wall thickness, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion. 
Conclusion: 
The continuation cases‚Äô clinical symptoms post-recovery indicates long Covid infection observed children. fact statistically significant differences observed echocardiographic parameters study control groups suggests Covid-19 may effects cardiovascular system. shed light long Covid cases among children infection‚Äôs cardiac impacts, would beneficial conduct comprehensive studies matter. start petition don‚Äôt wanna get mask vaccine can‚Äôt go hospital take beds people got sick . Also higher premium health insurance severe risk covid kids, spread misinformation  worse part - quackadoodle politicians supposed lose votes, gain...

People get vaccinated get kids vaccinated live consequences. 

I probably still wear mask transmission high, that‚Äôs choice. vaccines available basically everyone, don‚Äôt think masks mandates. commentary rediculuous way governor exacerbating spread threats schools trying protect children.

There's risk disease every time leave house. covid endemic, right good time any. protection drops longer wait, unless boosters definitely going everyone, safer time (covid-wise) go cruising right now. That‚Äôs awesome. COVID fucked shit like 7 months still can't breathe 100%

Again, Louisiana may higher rates Florida governor trying something it. Arkansas, high covid rate GOP governor taking seriously. Florida deSantis deserve criticism taking action.

The school board made minor change page Thursday: quarantine home 3 days exposure. Still online learning. 

Our kid 6. remember last year school shut down, coincided job shutting down, too. Otherwise would left scrambling. Thankfully husband could work home, otherwise would bit bind. It‚Äôs blur anxiety. 

The one thing say, doubt thinks ever shut again. people throwing giant tantrums potentially wearing masks, accept another lock down. 

I wish super boring easy school year. steady predictable double income. Best luck you, too!! that's going ruin anti-vaxxers' favorite excuse!

Damn you, FDA!  wonder antivaxx folks, use fda approval excuse, going use get it.  that's they're calling unmitigated recklessness selfishness now? ""giant experiment""? Fortunately vaxed not, likely mild symptoms, according data. teacher. policy (Virginia). Though staff mandatory vaccination yesterday. Apparently CDC: ‚ÄúPeople fully vaccinated need quarantine contact someone COVID-19 unless symptoms.‚Äù guess difference article telling unvaccinated teachers act way vaccinated teachers. good point. consider that. Yes people oblivious care 
Recently guy got busted selling 125 eBay, definitely fakes there. Plus people probably scanning making ""adjustments"" legal copies easily two weeks. easily 4 weeks. know 4 weeks even necessary. know science behind it. want isolate long to, longer need to. Thank you. Funny include whole quote 60 comorbidities. üòí random medical question anyone experienced worked it,

for covid patients spent lengthy time ventilators, point ""in clear""? get point getting ventilator removed? bottled oxygen? covid recovery widely varied ""safe"" get home weeks later? definitely understand mentality know someone similar situation. It‚Äôs tough loved one want protect keep alive long possible. modern science pretty much eliminated survival fittest 1st world human populations. first world human populations reject modern science, welcone back, survival fittest. want escape, do. There's huge brain drain many states smart kids get fuck minute can. Agreed. speak me, mom, high risk, also ‚Äúsheltered place‚Äù still got Covid somehow. stinking clue nothing seems plausible. went outside get mail mask gloves one around. didn‚Äôt go anywhere period. live apartments maybe neighbor breathed air near door??

Groceries delivered wouldn‚Äôt let touch anything they‚Äôd decontaminated removed packaging. hyper-vigilant went work back, put clothes container door, showered, wiped everything down.

I thought must given tested negative so... pretty scary time horrible illness, even though recovered home. 

The vaccines pretty safe effective, worth leaving house for. almost certainly eat, take, use things much less safe studied. Covid everywhere chances you‚Äôll go somewhere someday (post office, dentist, etc). It‚Äôs really worth risk getting Covid without vaccine. 

I mean, everyone thinks they‚Äôll fine they‚Äôre not. I‚Äôve encountered lot people. okay, impacted severely. I‚Äôve never ‚Äúneeded‚Äù seat belt wear every time anyway.

For me, like peace mind. also helps overall effort.

But case, please stay safe take care. can‚Äôt get job company mandates vaccines lot hesitancy vanish. insurance company ups deductible won‚Äôt get vaccinated people start change minds. one instance think we'll happy wrong vaccination rate spikes upon full approval. think it'll uptick bit, huge amount. people politicized may beyond redemption. I'll happy prove wrong. Yeah probably collapse lol.

I wear sauna. sauna go personal one one patron time. Smart people! Well, low probable someone love get die. 

Personally know died sucks. want anymore preventable deaths happening. psychiatrist always rushed days. bet she‚Äôs burned af might poke eye out. forum article yesterday saying England said 90% adults antibodies covid still hit hard. doubt see thing die till February. I‚Äôm pessimistic. Last winter rough. People flat DONE taking precautions. 40% refusing vaccinations carry us holy 4K deaths day December. can't imagine furious would city save bunch unvaccinated. 

The people worn masks gotten shots going take put boil notice lightly. real anger come towards responsible.

Hell, there's probably going lot unvaccinated (but otherwise uninfected) pissed well. boyfriend (in USA, ten minutes away) come visit can't go see him! bit wild. good luck even finding someplace treat it. delta 8, chemically processed version weed. 

Just stick cbd mixed weed. Travel allowed country flying from, nationality individual. country allowed enter US, like UK, travel third country spend two weeks flying States. Serbia last July. fair, kids low risk complications COVID19. vaccines completely safe age group, create major hesitancy, even vaxxed parents. make sure safe. now, Delta far less deadly original strain. Florida 1/10th deaths last July despite almost amount cases. would get prosecuted beating shooting people look different them. really tough decision. Time get Moderna booster then. Still wearing masks small stuff like saunas

I'm going strongly recommend wearing N95 masks sauna... That'd require missing work ~2 weeks every 6 months. That's unfathomable people. live Texas. pandemic?





/s staggering difference vaccination rates infection...I'm happy province tracking cases way. Delta came India vaccinated people still receive spread Delta.  Can‚Äôt wait hear in-laws excuses now, go crutch. Everywhere, really. getting ridiculous actually (darkly) comical. bet back virtual classes October. want wrong bad. right since February 2020 dammit. Genuinely might've died. Glad youre vaxxed safe! RemindME! 126 Days likelihood you‚Äôre reeling pain acute inability breathe you‚Äôve vaccinated? people slowly dying floor obviously severe covid, vaccines prevent absurdly high degree (over 90-95%). 

It‚Äôs safe assumption. I‚Äôm concerned waning immunity vaccines infection. teach local college. Two previously healthy, young students Covid-19 twice, hear accounts faculty members.

I bad feeling October. know.  I'd love hear information well immunity vaccine lasts. Versus long natural immunity getting virus. think gonna take couple years data really comes pipeline well analyzed. Good idea. feel like article roughly 2 months behind already know Delta variant shorter incubation period. I'm saying vaccines working?  wish completely, utterly, totally stupid. wish ignorant uneducated.

Stupid people seem catered much happier days. I‚Äôm getting really tired trying get family vaccinated. get people listen.

I guess ignorance bliss really true. Including vaccine requirements. full approval include 12 year old group? They're rare general. equally small unvaccinated people Israel idea trying say. Sure, mandate 50's. ethical, struggle (thats another topic). dubious fuck mandating kids something far less clear cut personal risk-benefit. theres sort blur risk benefit (which is) shouldnt mandating it. Least opinion. even mean? Herd immunity means population enough immunity overall outbreaks die really spread. Every single person dies, gets vaccinated, gets exposed virus develops natural immunity contributes herd immunity. ""missing boat,"" we're always getting closer it. Imagine you‚Äôre displaced cancer patients. That‚Äôs do. started therapy again. therapist insisted meet person initial visit. can‚Äôt virtual spring, guess quit therapy. call ""booster"" shots, two shots one year, seems like response covid-19 variants (e.g. mutations), right? missing something? time.

I dont think much plan whats going happen. Unbelievable canceling, postponing it. Irresponsible fuck. person whose wife took picture get vaccine. Unless achieve herd immunity risk. know people concerned dying it. Everyone talk worried Long Covid brain damage, affects somewhere 20-30% unvaccinated yet solid data vaccines lower number breakthrough cases. That‚Äôs kind sub that‚Äôll leave depressed closed opportunities positive change. It‚Äôs easy get bogged terrible news point forget much we‚Äôre capable fast things turn around. Russia lies.

I‚Äôm sorry. 12 year olds kids? know! (admittedly non-medical mind), seems obvious authorize mix-and-match approach. can't think vaccines care marching manufacturer, seems LOT advantages. FEMA send ton masks tell Alabama start using don‚Äôt won‚Äôt bother sending doctors scarce medical equipment. Think protecting immunocompromised others health conditions prevent getting vaccinated. chance safety us part. According Bloomberg Oregon given enough vaccines fully vaccinate 60% population. 

Wow. really thought much higher that. reversed decision. assume assumed that? don‚Äôt give fuck. think whatever want. Yea, feel guy even though delayed, made right choice end. Honestly, take popular it‚Äôs lazy. Every single state, including state, rural areas full poverty bigotry. may hate it, we‚Äôre part country, know certain NY crisis, state sent vents doctors you. kept back let y‚Äôall fend yourselves? No. love leaving areas rot country holding people actually responsible decades mismanagement accountable much difficult. Way easier blame rank file. wouldn‚Äôt get anxious you. Breakthrough cases still rare, symptomatic ones even rare. get booster can, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll fine!  wonder mandatory universal vaccination colleges vs permissive ones? 

I think going interesting too. university work requiring vaccines still various mask policies. really good job mitigating covid pre-vaccines era even small number students/classes allowed campus/in person, suspect/hope we'll continue well mitigating major problems, especially compared schools minimal policies. time tell. meanwhile unvaccinated Ted Nugget considers life-threatening Covid battle One Done, launching world tour, stuffing many fans many closet-sized venues find. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre I‚Äôve got backs 100%. could *possibly* go wrong?‚Äù. silly.

Actually, European countries successful healthcare systems element private insurance - much like Medicare system 65. goalposts already moved, anti vaxxers vaccine hesitants already said they‚Äôre falling it, knew close partner try edible. Half serving makes lie comatose bed hours. He'll two servings say finally feels high. weird bodies process differently. record, Official Motto USA is:

""Ain't way paying someone else's health care, especially something preventable"". Close schools, Reinstate mask mandates, get vaccinated, stay home bit longer.

This shouldn‚Äôt fucking hard people, please stay safe friends.  Well, seeing dumbass unvaccinated covid patients stealing hospital beds reason guess it‚Äôs moot point wouldn‚Äôt bed anyway. Nothing stops. Everything slows transmission rate. That's fundamental aspect epidemiology.

If slow rate infected person infects less one person, disease goes away. We've actually eliminated one disease, ever. Smallpox.

It's also possible exposed large concentration virus, may enough overwhelm primed immune system. Also possible vaccination produce significant immune response. Also possible breakthrough variant that's going mess us shortly... There's really way knowing.

COVID OTOH mutates far quickly. We're roughly 18 month mark looking *Gamma* variant. fewer 4 actively circulating COVID pathogens, high number available hosts, ample opportunity spawn new ones. vaccine made Alpha.

Making matters worse, Delta show greater risk reinfection, Gamma shows still higher risk something like 20% Gamma variant cases folks prior infections. wont ""burn through"", going wear people make dead bodies can, species, get act together. 

We arent keeping this, social resistance undermining science. battle going one attrition. Outlook good. Ok thanks! saw end year Pfizer age two haven‚Äôt seen anything since. applies parents unvaccinated children immunocompromised.

Given testing slowed way many places (employers requiring it, etc) it‚Äôs much harder access others, I‚Äôd err side holy shit, that‚Äôs lot new cases.

So let‚Äôs conservative say actual cases 3-fold higher, 450,000 new cases every day. people contagious for, let‚Äôs average 8 days, means 1 every 93 Americans contagious given day.

Friday, government said coronavirus reproduction number, R value, England gone 0.9 1.2. Last week, 0.8 1. R represents average number people Covid-19 positive person goes infect. figure 1, outbreak grow exponentially 1, means epidemic shrinking.

They going wrong direction. get fired take Pfizer instead? ""If get Pfizer Johnson Johnson, count!"" *do* know vaccinated people spread virus viral load unvaccinated, right? That's CDC says, anyway.  people 4 months second shot though; earliest-vaccinated UK - include healthcare workers decline efficacy would noticeable. true countries.

‚ÄúCovid reaches astronomical levels Louisiana‚Äù

Does ‚Äútrying‚Äù really make difference? feel-good measure viral disease almost powerless stop apart vaccinating prevent bad outcomes.   schools across Europe operating?

The idea can't look abroad data growing pretty tiring. would say this, would much easier. wish people would realize this. Even someone planning surprise birthday party conspiracy, friends *conspiring* give good day.

and there's shitload mundane (and sensational) gov't conspiracies turned true.

The issue fixating things understand demanding conspiracy actually exist - less harm simple greed. still risk asymptomatic transmission via vaccinated lead rape possible breakthrough infections well transmission unvaccinated individuals.  brainwashed religion. unpacked ya. Agreed. gets kicked out, drive somewhere (without exposing people) access care gets worse. means return person classes, activities, sporting events research labs planning fall semester, residential experiences heart university.‚Äù

They seem one schools saying activities buildings open students.

Though still require masks reason. r/nottheonion Wow. lived two doors DKE house college. I'm sorry, Florida. understand satire you? child like mind fixated virus originated. fact Florida become petri dish variant spread. care can't admit that. don‚Äôt feel like school protecting children, find another school 

That would work fine educational freedom USA

But don‚Äôt. is... creative. I'm sure I'll get use future, intend someday lol Hence boosters. Go get vaccinated boosted 8 months out. won‚Äôt take vaccine health concerns. pill gave six pack abs six pack buzz they‚Äôd eat handful Agreed. 
And FL myself... Really wish understood -all- projected forms media. 
The constant ""kill em all"" vibe getting hand. dislike arguments (especially posed ""debates"") sooooo.. :) 
appreciate you! cons? Yes is. passport system hastily rolled late still go lockdown mid November. Looking overall mortality rate COVID, wasted wish. know son mandated. He's college kid whose college forcing dragged along. know her. lives pretty Republican area, probably not, knows. It‚Äôs true don‚Äôt know long term effects are. eases mind any, put statement context, wanted point many viruses cause long term effects kids adults. Enteroviruses, DNA viruses (ie: chickenpox/shingles), herpes viruses, even flu, lead long term complications. Now, isn‚Äôt say concern isn‚Äôt viable need get throw caution wind ‚Äî but, thinking this, keep mind long term side effects probably rare, aren‚Äôt (yet) aware RNA virus (like one causes covid) cause long term effects. 

So, don‚Äôt know yet. it‚Äôs something keep mind, completely shape lives next decade waiting studies. hope there‚Äôs nothing comes covid infection involves long term side effects, don‚Äôt know won‚Äôt time come. And, anything long term, develop treatment.

Anyway ‚Äî thanks cognizant precautions responsible, adding masses infected need medical care. Notice capitulated anti maskers stopped freaking hospitals would overrun, hospitals overrun?

Man, folks like ""show there's hospitals overrun!""

We never stopped lockdowns 90% vaccinated. ACA one. Gee shit running rampant again, maybe ought do‚Ä¶..FUCKING SOMETHING‚Ä¶..in one main bullshit disseminators?

IF dont want take vaccine fine, need accept fines extra costs go life choice. Also hospital service get covid, clearly didnt care enough first time round. study paper something this? Thanks.  also question. I‚Äôm starting pivot mindset accepting encounter virus point (challenging year+ avoiding it), get point vaccinated people go back going lives even mild covid? forever testing, quarantining, isolating etc.?

Keep mind, 'government sanctioned official: many trackers using number. researchers looking it.

Yes, number variants grown. Yes, vaccination also grown. also large number unvaccinated folks well globally, they‚Äôre still likely largest segment population spreading virus. 

The number mutations growing variants sub-variants much better multiplying. It‚Äôs easier see mutations virus produces roughly 1000x copies successfully person infects (as case delta).

So again, you‚Äôre seeing correlation controlling heterogenous variables. Keep information quality high. I‚Äôve living rock, app?

They secure, never indended be, never needed be. It‚Äôs industry solve government‚Äôs problem vaccine passports. Yes good. move now. better peoples mental health. Oh already that. UK data, vaccine reduces chance infection ~80% chances hospitalization infected ~70%. still leaves really absurd number vaccinated people need hospitalization.

Also, they're using much effective 8-12 week dosing interval. dont understand locate plants do. Currently 550,000 gallons water moving TN river SECOND, would build plant literally one would miss 10 million gallons year. youre dumb enough need make sense. people dont require consistent ideology.  going cause people use water want collect much possible purification system gets overwhelmed.

Get used prepare get booster. said before. company/organization need workers understand science, logic, weigh need others, cannot change views based data, think issues black/white, want take advice experts, threaten want right things, etc. general characteristics anti-vaxx/masks manifestation intrinsic make-up. Probably true now, said thing Obama elected.  find local news Facebook stories covid, comment section. Boy-howdy kooks come out! However getting frustrated garbled messaging CDC. 

The CDC putting garbled message :( happening that, conditions change (i.e. new Delta variant) CDC adjust recommendations take new data evidence account. Things change - roll program follow latest seems uncertain booster shot accomplish. 

There nothing ""uncertain this. Studies pretty clearly indicated immunity wanes 6 months so, especially older individuals, booster brings back immune response delta variant back original 2 shot levels. Crappy 4-5 days, recovered rapidly that. Thankfully breathing issues. Flu symptoms morphed head cold.   problem folks think better vaccine. not, 1000x costly, 1000x dangerous 1000x less effective vaccine. that, people meet criteria people going get feel need it, late. Yet treatments available states average vaccine rates. governors instead spend resources higher vaccination rates. Sorry dumb type approval EUA? Yup. People loooove doom ""tHe ApPrOvAl rUsHeD!!!!!!!1"" horseshit like land border opened Americans last week, gotta prove vax'd We've path Idiocracy now. step-sister works monoclonal antibody infusion center Alabama working overtime weeks end. 

When CDC said vaccinated people wear masks again, father want to. grudgingly wore want start again. talked phone described seeing read delta, he's back grudgingly wearing masks again. people listen!

And he's even type person politically there, type expect believe vaccines masks. he's still vaccinated wearing masks even crazy conspiracy kooks believe science! company said ""vaccine come office""

Whether continue working home manager. managers says come office vaccinated refuse get vaccinated? That's termination masks keep warm cool weather. mind them. understand agree me. get it..sort of. Gotta admit saw coming. state SC half vaccinated. sucks. worry trying work. worry kids. rest you. I‚Äôm sure governors states like Florida change requirements collect unemployment something something ‚Äúmuh freedoms‚Äù. allow young children eligible?   wear mask protect vaccinated. Keep assuming it'll serve well. OP here.

Sorry dead people ruined brunch. Unfortunately, 50% Floridians believe media/hospitals/doctors lying making numbers order make money/take freedom. nowhere near end I'm afraid.  Vaxxed Prozac wants join anyone resources quit job something stupid this, would've quit job already rolling it.

What idiots trying bluff like game poker. not. Yea definitely need better data transparency. fda one developed worlds health institutes approve thalidomide. cautious shit purpose. know many people. many know financial resources back claim? know zero. Good, schools mandate it.

Edit: Grades 7 12 course. condolences electrical grid. May photocopiers fixed thoughts prayers. could start mixing shots, Pfizer followed Moderna 2nd shot booster. Huh, last year Florida Texas treat water, They're beating countries. Damn. Hello, Mr Perfectly Fine. How's heart infecting mine? R. E. Everyone family vaxxed, Dems Republicans alike. Everyone took first opportunity. I'm talking 25 people. Japan's COVID fatality rate pretty low moment. 0.20% Japan, US 0.75%. Also cases per capita still much lower Japan. Also masks outside, evidence needed?

You need carefully consider evidence taking costly dangerous actions. 

When cost minimal potential benefit massive, masks default whether there's evidence not.  ‚ÄúOk boys, grab shovels. Time move goal post.‚Äù call vaccine lasts 5-8 months success? really feel like need make new vaccines based spike protein. got second dose today! Astra Zeneca J%J us DNA viral vectors. data inputted CDC - fully vaccinated percent too. Here's 60% matters - big boost first-dose vaccinations last weeks result Delta, especially vulnerable least vaccinated states like Louisiana, Arkansas Tennessee. That's big deal - first dose provide real protection. importantly, safe say see similar surge second dose vaccinations, high majority go back finish process. Better sticking head sand amirite  heard surgeon general say they‚Äôre waiting final data, analysis said data approval distribution still take couple months fully approved businesses start firing people without fear lawsuits forcing EUA-only vaccine. Forcing fully approved vaccine less settled law point- businesses right so. (Will make people question blind support businesses holding power? Probably not, digress.)

You know would also suck? Getting COVID without health insurance. motivate people think. 

I hold much hope many idiots still waiting, agree insignificant number get vaccine want get fired own. not-insignificant amount people waiting this

I'm sure we'll see brief uptick numbers fall back again, lines sand drawn long now. Also young people killed Spanish Flu pass vulnerable genes. happen COVID-19, killing people 50. thinking thing. drug FDA-approved?

This pure insanity. Making return office ‚Äúmandatory‚Äù seems bit silly days. don‚Äôt want vaccine wtf mandate would kinda bad asked data bad reasons. study data says effectively safe, wanted expand study flimsy reasoning. medical emergency call EUA.

What odd take lol Posted thread, bears repeating:

**THIS CHOICE**

Why decided people right turn vaccine, even means *entire city runs safe water*?

Absolutely insane.

We let people turn vaccine guarantee treatment, mandate vaccine guarantee treatment. crazy. Good news, then: enuf idiots ignore safety precaution natural immunity may develop soon. way natural immunity, millions deaths. win... lose?

There's another issue consider, regarding ur risk tolerance argument: lack medical care.

Let's say ur immune low risk: go live ur life! HOWEVER, evidence ur still spreading virus. what, right? Even ur family miraculously shrugs variants, u issue overrun medical facilities. Broken leg? Good luck finding nurse, doctor, empty hospital room. Routine scan needed? Sorry, u wait months; dont staff take care u. üò•

So want (and everyone else) go back normal lives, u smart. Rush finish line, u literally break ur leg trip everyone around u! u go straight hospital, straight back start line, race normal gets even LONGER. Paywall    Wait, library? They're sending people infected covid-19, probably hospital driving town treatment, good grief! wonder widespread there. Unvaccinated people treated hospitals. absolutely hilarious tragic much saving water going happen.  skeptical due overwhelming science backing skepticisms, they're skeptical based misleading information, rare cases, outright lies. trolling all, sick insane anti-opiate propaganda spread around hurting people one cares. tell pay much insurance unhealthy? Sorry getting screwed . Healthy people shouldn‚Äôt get punished think missing point think taken virus makes absolutely sense calling horse drug correct. I'm sure. home test kit that's good. Home oximeter too. recently started new job tiny fraction sick time/PTO previous job did. moderate severe case covid could easily cause lose job (USA).

Btw, year two looking jobs old organization much better PTO policy I'm new job advance career. using boosters get international population started first doses Old age comorbidity guess. worried sister (13) starting school next week?

She autoimmune disorder, school require masks (she wearing one times eating). She‚Äôs fully vaccinated robust immune response second shot (fever, chills, fatigue, etc. pretty much every possible Pfizer side effect).

Her doctor given green light in-person instruction worry county lives 40% people vaccinated one dose (and that‚Äôs one higher rates, Jesus Christ, Missouri get shit together) wish university. Instead people school keep asking long think it‚Äôll end online again. past 3 semesters hell online, thought going back people refuse vaccine makes blood boil. Even odd spent months saying HCQ miracle cure, suddenly, soon Daddy news networks stopped telling that's believe, just...stopped believing it. true... least warning gives seniors heads up. weigh risks rewards own. Someone who's 85 may definitely decide take family reunion cruise Alaska, opposed recently retired 66 year old. Reinfections still really rare occurrence right? mean thing know media would going batshit crazy it, right???!! improving quickly Spain also, take word ""staying home severe self-restrictions"" cause.
The morons acted responsible since beginning still don't, and, vaccinated, admit relaxed lot.
So must burns popuation quickly, IDK. Percent positive tests relative tests given? would expect high percentage given people mostly test symptoms right? Seems odd metric. missing something?

Also fan ‚Äúlet‚Äôs look 2 criteria use whichever sounds scarier‚Äù Let's go FDA approval mandates everywhere. Mandate anything. Job, school, events, etc. TSA make mandatory get security. Negative + 1 shot gets through. Gotta get shot though. Otherwise drive.

Enough. Of. This. mean.. pretty strong claim make.

We plenty research suggests outcomes/circumstances childhood really lasting imprints people‚Äôs lives. 

If keeping kids school big developmental educational costs (and is), that‚Äôs gonna really difficult fix line ""only"" 90-95% unvaccinated people you‚Äôre preventative care?

Because that‚Äôs education is. 

It‚Äôs people already infected. It‚Äôs improve future. Exactly, especially [public discussion sessions guaranteed time move EUA full approval. Full transparency!

We‚Äôve several days 2,000+ new cases, highest SK since beginning pandemic. Now, last couple weeks so, people given 24 hour windows certain days sign first shot depending date birth. believe half country received first dose finally, today. dictatorship would prevent stupidity. UK opened up, infection rate shot up, say, deaths hospitalisations even nearly follow curve like before. There's lots people get poorly need hospital.

No vaccine back then, cautious still lost 28 coworkers, 16K positive patients, around 4K make throughout system. 7 freezer trucks rotated every 14 days, overwhelming mentally.

Jumped opportunity get vaccinated January, seeing makes heart sink. Knowing could vaccinated saddens end.

The virus care are, infect you. We're seeing breakthrough cases thankfully admissions severe cases breakthroughs.

Boosters coming available next month, I'm setting area give jumping first shot again.

Mentally coworkers want go again, fear many reach breaking point even therapy. know trolling, glossing 10-20 years history comes issue. crush someone else car. that's even crazier. get effective treatment *long* covid, becomes flu vaccinated basically. Worth taking basic precautions worth rearranging life otherwise healthy. Long covid everything (frequency, long lasts, cause it) huge unknown right now.

There ways get pandemic too, like super rapid accurate tests everywhere. What's better vax negative test mandate bar concert? Actual on-the-spot tests let know patron contagious right moment. dunno I'd rather drink unvaccinated person without covid vaccinated person covid (ok, maybe conversation wise, would lower risk getting covid).

Or N95+ quality masks actually comfortable everyday use mailed everyone wearers mask essentially safe matter people around doing.

There levers pull - public messaging went vaccines, even end pulling far (middling vax rate). FDA needs least keep us loop taking long

Which probably made worse [the FDA announced public despite part process move EUA full approval. 

Pretty hard instill trust change process remove previously guaranteed transparency. could see used ""further proof"" shady shit? Talk unforced error..  Glossing side effects survivors.  least bleach right?  business librarian public library baller, there's that!  wonder holds true face shields well.

Natural selection real time. Fascinating time alive. argument ‚Äúit‚Äôs right‚Äù.

Sure, people saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs right‚Äù, also plenty people legitimately distrustful vaccine.

In New York city instance, highest demographic unvaccinated people minorities don‚Äôt trust York City data shows city‚Äôs vaccine uptake lowest among certain demographics, particularly Black residents account lowest, 31% reported fully vaccinated. Latinos fare bit better 42%, White residents 46% fully vaccinated. comparison, 67% Native Americans 71% Asians Pacific Islanders fully vaccinated. difference ""had"" ""has?"" crapload COVID cases. many STUPID Americans! It‚Äôs country going fail/collapse next 2-3 decades.

Grifters gonna grift. think get point *everyone* access vaccine precedent boosters available people everyone manage risk. means waiting 12 vaccine approved, boosters table, FDA approval doctors use discretion use label. luckily, two three things happen!! 

I think last one important us stop wait CDC come around conclusions we've aware (like wanting efficacy, least older population). Doctors use discretion analyze local community spread individual's health determine another booster line might prudent. 

Again, ultimately get back close normal people options protect on-going basis. idiotic take. Everything reopened, Delta reared head. typically find info 90+% unvaccinated driving this. Thanks. frustrating 20 months finally caught it. taking many precautions, feels like parts life pause year half kids feeling it. work 5 months pandemic. virtual school children go back work. government longer paying people quarantine exposure positive test, I'm going go without paycheck least 2 weeks. vacation time, used February son exposed school quarantine 10 days. wreck kids going back school without masks required even though wear theirs. I'm glad I'm guilty vaccinated I'd lying say scared. I'm scared 6 11 year old vaccinated. really hoping age group approved school started. could afforded keep home, would have. Walked restaurant grab takeout yesterday San Diego realized one without mask (I've fully vaccinated 4 months) shocked. 

I put one real quick case since minor inconvenience. Crazy different different parts country handling this. world gone full mad. Kids need social interaction. Sub-convalescent means level serum antibodies neutralization titres less natural infection. Data Moderna, Pfizer, Sputnik V, Johnson Johnson (approved one dose), Novavax, many 1.6x neutralizing antibodies natural infection two doses.

I‚Äôll let family know someone thinks said something smart next time look dumbfounded ramblings. one proof vaccinations don‚Äôt work joke. 

So got vaccinated cant anything, limited things unvaccinated people. get vaccinated ? way know many true first doses? this‚Ä¶..Darwinism? maybe idiocrasy coming life.

Let's assume 1% death rate Covid, they're always citing 99% survival rate. 150,000 commercial flights day worldwide. 1,500 crashed every day, every single day, would get plane?

And that's DIE. Suppose additional 10,000 hard landings day disable passengers, many life? 

Good luck people. know frustrating is. really, gamble direction. It‚Äôs morally wrong thing.  Bubonic plague little different - Bacteria, virus. can't make make sense. vaccine stop getting it, makes body better fighting it.  usually means milder symptoms importantly lower viral load.


The viral load heavily affects chances infecting somebody else. Let try poor comparison.


Let's say raining outside need get car.  pouring leisurely stroll spend lot time outside, pretty likely get wet. Let's say drizzling outside instead run quickly car possible.  likely got couple raindrops pretty dry overall   might something there. probably get rest country vaccinated deep-fry put stick.  Fuck person. hope take every dime. [Looks like didn‚Äôt. anti-vax meme. They‚Äôre exactly reliable.

Also, would source..i've trying google it, but, come much. Thanks least they're dying*worm-free* Lol 2 weeks. Heard one before. Get vaccinated get boosters, it‚Äôs time move on. Immunity natural infection nearly good immunity via vaccination. Reinfection absolutely possible there‚Äôs reason risk might lucky second time. I'm bit conundrum. mom got booster today (7+ months since second dose immunocompromised). dad late 70's, also 7+ months since second dose. get booster too. know exactly 8 months, close, doses plentiful are, regularly interacts lot unvaccinated people. Anny advice do? Pfizer vaccines, makes difference. read getting vaccine early, get bigger boost 3rd dose, feel like 7 months much difference versus 8 months. advice?  fight guys, right! way patience me. can't go type subs stupidity would drive crazy within 2 3 posts. Lord, please don‚Äôt let President point still stands, weird. time refuse vaccine also sign contract waiver agreeing eligible hospital care eventually contract covid. said going throw masks trash vaccinated.

Like initial vaccination, although shots rare time, see large groups people respond, like doctors/nurses getting third shot first december. really issues, downsides, simple highly consider.

But seeing lot antibodies waning quite lot understanding long term immunity could prevent severe infection hospitalization, guess far case, although followed Israel situation closely. think tons vaccinated people still getting fairing fine, wonder small asymptomatic encounter boost antibodies itself. would like see studies ancedotal antibody reports.

Only two things see far vaccine might prevent spreading, least kids can't quite protect (after widespread approval yea bit personal responsibility person next get vaccinated). concerning thing see far recent reports long Covid symptoms potentially vaccinated individuals definitely worries bit.

Pretty sure exposed times vaccinated symptoms, isolated never got tested. Also got Moderna seems hold immunity longer. Came say exactly this. Honestly curious - happens administer vaccine someone who's already symptomatic virus? staying home isn‚Äôt living? older people much time left earth 1.5 years already taken them. missing point professor's argument.

But I'm saying unacceptable CDC US tracking raw breakthrough infection numbers (i.e. X number covid cases week, fully vaccinated). many complications covid infection may result hospitalization. public deserves see understand raw data.

I've friends lose sense taste smell covid even though vaccinated. yet regain it, hopefully back normal next week so.

Also, massive narrative people vaccinated protect general population preventing transmission. Without raw data, cannot understand good that. Shea, former Washington state representative, also played leading role event spoke crowd supposed dangers vaccine mandates.

Not lawyer, read actual text They‚Äôre actually month two behind. Covid stay. going case surges like years. They‚Äôll probably get smaller smaller we‚Äôll treat like respiratory disease. However US life pretty normal even rampant Covid.

we decided risk wait 5-11 approval, since seems like could month two. though realize everyone situation opinion Pretty sure already legal. machine + expertise resources run it. ECMO small thing. playing Pandemic the, would totally winning strategy.  problem people fail realize even COVID 15x chance myocarditis vaccine don‚Äôt 100% chance getting COVID. 100% chance getting vaccine get vaccine. 

If disease caused 10% people‚Äôs hair turn blue 1 100 people got disease year 0.1 100 peoples hair would turn blue. came vaccine cause 2% peoples hair turn blue 2 100 treated people would get blue hair. That‚Äôs 20 times amount people getting blue hair disease could say vaccine 5 times less likely give blue hair disease. 

So saying COVID likely cause myocarditis vaccine apple apples comparison know sure 100% people going get COVID. 

NONE SAY SHOULDNT GET VACCINES RISKS SIDE EFFECTS. risk vs reward carefully considered. means need good trials well supervised. takes time. 

First, harm something like 400 child deaths per year vs risk vaccine kills (or major harm) 400 children per year.

It's definitely balancing act. like 400,000 figure adults, rapid emergency approval very, justified. Emergency approval still justified, perhaps slightly less urgency.

Having said that, looking forward child vaccinated. He's 11 --- young enough can't get vaccinated, old enough birthday come right authorize vaccine younger kids. Get ready see antivax goalposts shift newfound swiftness. made $2000 last year rely others keep housed, food bank keep fed. It‚Äôs tough. Hang kids premature CT 2011 told nearest ECMO NYC, think Columbia. Thankfully never needed it!! I'm sorry perceived superior. absolutely feel so. feel bit tired seeing many people mean one another sides, ignoring actual facts.

That said, wish good luck steady health wife. best. feel goalposts moving already. ""asks travelers high risk severe COVID-19 avoid cruises""

Without data, speculation.

For example, Israel one study looked at, exactly 1 person 60 got severely ill, 80 older. unvaxxed.  debate majority knows even Florida. minority paint sniffers loud af hostile. Delta here.

 ordered antigen tests online. fully vaccinated rather weak Chinese Sinovac vaccine. positive, not. 

Walking around obvious high % population covid. Mask wearing low. social distancing. One unmasked woman market said vendor 'I lost sense taste'. 

Most people believe covid, claim tested positive pregnant whatever. 

It's shit show.

The urban population interested vaccination, government prevented air travel etc. without vaccination, though flights shut anyway. True, many confounders. adults still numbers starting go back :/

Yeah, I'm really sure exactly fuck supposed given UK situation. cases still REALLY high (roughly equivalent 150k/day US) climbing, albeit climbing slowly. true they've got 95% adults immunity... know. zero chance containing something contagious. That's fucking ridiculous level spread population that's immune. world gonna now, forever, guess. There's light end tunnel that's 95% looks like. Agreed. vaccinated, still little bit worry get COVID. However, point make still good one. COVID takes young healthy people. Unvaccinated people need stop thinking okay get COVID. Corner shops? masks. Fully packed football stadium? masks. Supermarkets? fifty-fifty. London Underground? Nearly everybody.

Most people still wear mask _sometimes_, think mostly go somewhere quick look round see still mask kind place. decide whether put not.  health department emailed yesterday begging people reduce social circles.

With Delta, (if report accurate) average much longer, means far people going unknowingly spread virus. 


And far asymptomatics go - true asymptomatic (never symptoms) symptoms show test result (pre-symptomatic)? True asymptomatics thought spread virus much due lower viral load. ""there two new variants arrived Florida health officials concerned.

A problem back April, CDC stopped counting breakthrough infections. reports like major breakthrough outbreak MA. much ""following science.""

What they're looking certain number incidents occur. case, ""contracting COVID"" whatever definition (e.g., symptomatic COVID positive PCR test). threshold reached, data unblinded see many incidents either arm (placebo test) determine efficacy.

While hard date end it, also reach sooner high rate incidents. COVID vaccine trials took less time typical vaccine trials (which often take years) high community infection rate going on. 

And similarly, Delta variant going around, that's going accelerate trials well.  fair, days get sleep lot, days go call call, days don‚Äôt get save someone time watch die arms. think deserve respect.  Moderna year ago saying virus attacked children like elderly, people would united fighting it.

* work full time, cautious university luckily, work still home, there's guarantee called back middle semester. also already spent last year splitting attention performance suffer.

The virus 99% survival rate, hospitals fill up. 

Every patient needs hospital can't admitted **WILL DIE**. 

Patients need hospital, sent home hospitals full need cared family.  family constantly exposed high levels covid virus, everyone family get sick, since everyone sick stuck home, passing virus back forth other. entire families die.  

The COVID hospitalization rate 12%, Covid hospital stays long usually 10-14 days. 

When hospitals fill death rate climb high hospitalization rate, 12%.  

Since 1/2 population unvaccinated, 50% vaccinated, 3 different vaccines partially effective, perfect environment create super variant.

This true. average Chinese person always treated covid like SARS-II -- cure, ""decently"" high risks, potentially yucky aftertastes. know person thinks so, living China.

And Chinese model can't really copied individual ""small countries"", ""small"" include countries potentially even like Italy Germany. China enormous domestic population allows sustain decent levels tourism consumption locked rest world. There's also minimal border control required compared size -- China's land borders sparsely populated neighbours untraversable terrain, sea arrivals negligible.

Many countries simply cannot physically afford those. say EU somehow decided go zero covid somehow succeeded la Chinese way (putting aside could possible), EU *maybe* could also sustained decent economy. lot people employer paying insurance. think employer would like cover extra expensive workers?

The sad irony people hold fact vaccines rigorously tested studied widely used, time waving around unverified, untested, easily disproved opinions proof dangers vaccine. demand vaccine must held highest levels scrutuny deemed safe, also demand equal measure evidence determined dangerous.  Iceland 90% vaccination rate. 80% new covid cases among vaccinated. understand cautious point caution negligence There‚Äôs messaging/policy problem built here. 

‚ÄúYou guys followed directions idea life would go something resembling pre-01/01/2020 normal. Turns out‚Ä¶you‚Äôre perpetual danger (extra high July 15 May 1 following year) thanks variants society can‚Äôt deal face masks.‚Äù title misleading ""high"" vaccinations, ""But Palestinian population source transmission Israel. vaccinated Palestinians given permits enter Israel Israeli settlements.""  One quibble -- 95% data pre-Delta; nothing knowledge shows level protection infection point.

Nevertheless, vaccines still effective substantially reducing risks infection Thank God! wonder feels like know gambling actual lives thousands upon thousands people. You‚Äôd sociopath okay that. soon going nation wide ""drink punch"" scenario thousands people going end dead drinking chlorine cocktails. Idk downvoted yes degree. Countries UK routinely vaccinating U16's. uncertainty data. Therefore arguable vaccinating kids way experimental. 

Its really sad people split sort comment negatively received. texas, making stupid decisions impacting everyones health safety?  doesn‚Äôt explain bad news, doctors say, half Israel's seriously ill patients currently hospitalized fully vaccinated least five months ago IOC: ""muh mean CDC recommended month ago? Wow earned downvotes. Yeah looks around 15/16 states 'might' peaking trending now. Hopefully we'll see nationwide within 2 weeks.... look like fucked around found moment realize parent / child roles reversed.

Fast forward, pulled much better. idea long term health issues. one hope...monday. US, first wave people left for/returned war spring spread around. bad mitigation efforts attempted, anti-maskers con artists like now. People less inclined take seriously poorly educated sort thing general. Medicine still pretty wild back then. 

The second wave hit fall bunch major cities literally decided throw big Armistice Day parades celebrations middle flu pandemic knowing risks. wave much deadlier intense. terrible hospital staffing shortages, close businesses like theaters staggered schedules. Young people got incredibly sick. People asked crowd public transport get much fresh air possible. 195,000 people died October alone. 

The third wave came heels second still brutal less finally focusing public education redesigning spaces ventilation stop spread. Radiators look way 1918. 

The flu finally receded spring warmed (like Covid) generally faded infected many people globally. mutated harmless strain still around. real fanfare big event mark end everything cases still lingered years, over. 

You see similarities. Good news: we're finally going get first good RCT mask usage. 

One authors said [coming 48-72 believe cluster randomized trial impact mask wearing transmission Bangladesh (you read previous research -- promote mask usage -- really thrilled state research masks real-world settings, it'll great finally high-quality research it. trying = success, though? analyzing pandemic 'tries' success rate? sure tried Afghanistan 20 years shit hit fan week it?

We talk percentages, numbers, cases, vaccines, negative light FL, states worse, 'trying', that's OK?

I'm judging FL based numbers, hospitalizations, vaccines, etc, can't ignore states worse enforcing something feels good... know. Coronavirus aside, think norovirus enterovirus outbreaks recently. last place would want seriously ill cruise ship bunch sick people. Good already paying higher premium unhealthy June, thought reaching end pandemic. Florida keeps getting hit waves upon waves next November, fair say amount dead people might tip election they're disproportionately one party. Kirk Cousins get vaccine, thank heavens  recognize technically disease. since produces 1000x viral particles present nose, spreads much easily, evades current vaccines, behaves differently previous variants requires new response. it‚Äôs got FDA approval human usage, unlike vaccine? /s Read comments preprint. Maybe could find LSD.  Candy shaped laundry pods one moments joy adulting. Dammit don‚Äôt take away us! suppose that's hopeful then.

These would much helpful SE Asia Africa. isn‚Äôt surge NYC. fat heart disease! kill people per year covid even 65 group. think competent lockdowns (New Zealand + China) way. Vaccines help won‚Äôt end it. governor. No. real one.  I‚Äôm fully vaccinated wore mask except actively eating drinking. 

If everyone bar restaurant vaccinated low risk activity. That‚Äôs love new policy. 

I‚Äôm sorry full lockdown US isn‚Äôt practical mathematically needed community high vaccination rates policies like this.  many months ago local health department said informing positives within 48 hours negatives within week (or more) Florida may rank 21/50 vaccination, they're also 2/50 tourism. Meanwhile, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio rank bottom 20.

So may okay vaccination rate, also probably getting ton visitors whose vaccination status also questionable. 

Upon quick check, Florida received estimated 130 million tourists 2019. That's 6 times much entire population. That's exactly spread Israel - highly vaccinated middle class suburbs. concerning.  know someone died Tuesday covid fully vaccinated, perfectly healthy. ‚ÄúI got Disney World generates less sympathy‚Äù doubt she‚Äôd say that. Blaming school easy. 

Disclosure: I‚Äôve WDW recently going soon. state health officer report office governor?  considered artifical selection humans ""natural selection themselves""? ü§î I‚Äôve never understood little slack afforded public health officials (esp science &amp; research side) coping *novel* disease evolves faster pokemon binge eating candy things gameboy days. 

That said, terrifically optimistic frustrated/tired/divided population interpret updated guidance. inflected huge/powerful industries cannot afford society choosing cautious (ships, hotels, venues etc expensive). 

Then we‚Äôve got ‚Äúnow what?‚Äù First half-asses border closures, two week half-asses shut downs, herd immunity, vaccines, we‚Äôre here. 

Medical professionals beyond words exhaustion frustration. low-info voters taking livestock dewormers. I‚Äôm seeing/hearing breakthrough cases left right social media person (my friend‚Äôs grandma died, although post-organ transplant immunosuppressants effectively negated vaccine protection). think also large set people test unless to; ie admitted hospital.   Exactly. Female employees often assaulted raped can‚Äôt seek remedies reason. 

This article teenage guest, gives idea:  That's old data. Delta predominant strain United States right now: saying Lambda variant could outcompete Delta? Seems unlikely, considering infectious Delta variant is. Well yeah mean I'm grateful Ive vaccinated opposed not. there's doubt Sinovac considered one less effective vaccinations number double-jabbed medical staff died covid despite vaccinated here. mentioned matter information vaccine use west 

So far daughter (unvaccinated) caught fingers crossed that. worried low risk health, needs fly back UK soon number risks terms tested positive departure arrival UK, could turn quite inconvenient costly. 

They vaccinating children theory practice vaccination currently difficult get hold (I got first shot June time little interest (before started rules travel)), really likely relevant. even last year. March 2021, written journalist: piece journalist NY Times, June: [""They Relied Chinese Vaccines. They‚Äôre Battling US Europe battling outbreaks. think NY Times publish analogous article ""Western vaccines""? We‚Äôre not. 30% eligible population fully vaccinated. We‚Äôre also position high expectations. aren‚Äôt exacted emerge restrictions rate hits 70-80%. 

The mental health situation is. can‚Äôt vouch nation whole several friends taking well. great moment. Agreed, realize huge segment population. 

I understand low vaccine rates health care workers, specifically nurses. 96% doctors US vaccinated, think nurses would realize doctors know do. heard interview NPR day nurse said confused differing info reading know truth. ask one fucking doctors hospital worked clarity? No. people able use deductive reasoning skills. I'm actually boat. like take anything market less 5 years COVID ominious encough willing take chances vaccine months. think there's group dug approved, saw working admit wrong first place quickly get say see waiting verified I'm crazy anti Vax. I've got family group sure nearly thing, minimum wage people can't survive make. cops simply need get free vaccine keep jobs PROTECT others around getting sick job. Ultimately matters number kids needing ICU care much hospitals handle. explosion cases still killing kids need ICU beds reasons, cannot get them. Vaccination desperately needed prevent surge kids going school. Also, long term consequences covid simply considering deaths.

This isa 100% true, even order magnitude cost leaving high risk patients unvaccinated. adults need third dose 8 months 2nd dose.

Again, better spent arms 0 doses. Thank information. take chances. positive test result would disaster me. Wouldn‚Äôt low vaccination rates mean virus need mutate? Severe insulating unvaccinated like article doesn‚Äôt help anything. definitely won‚Äôt read article possibly persuaded get vaccine. understand that‚Äôs choice. hope you‚Äôre least taking precautions thing changed realization. correct one. They've always there. George Carlin told Think stupid average person is, realize half stupider that. science there. rushed, we're leaps bounds ahead last time needed create vaccine save countless lives. mRNA technology (fascinating worth celebrating) deployed right going transform medical care coming decades, years.

Imagine encountering new virus, viable vaccine year's time month. heading direction happy, fearful.

I get ignorant, willful kind. Inform yourself: vaccines safe. Let die, body choice right? Fuck em Ok then. aren‚Äôt monopoly, though. Anyone home school send kid private school. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

They care; think world get get world. mom brothers same. it‚Äôs getting approved, they‚Äôll getting vaccinations soon what's alternative? Stay home bunker another year? virus always mutate become infectious deadly. 

But real danger developing vaccine resistance. Theoretically anywhere vaccine resistant mutation could occur, region high vaccination rate mutation would competitive edge would spread.
Again could anywhere developed world, infected people higher chance. Love it. Someone finally saying many us thinking.

Lmao people still think event lot people s√∫per-spreader event, that's works county 90% vaccinated  Yes also mask also different understand sentiment, historically vaccine long term effects like this. MRNA development long time without long term effects know of..(I‚Äôm doctor scientist though It‚Äôs possible misinformed here)

You could also apply argument COVID itself, make sick, (and rare, potentially die) pass others long term effects already popping  highly affected populations already vaccinated. people understand that? ones saying vaccines experimental. I'm saying decision vaccinate kids considered degree experimental. massive difference. Guess grasp something UK's regulators fail too, patrol coronavirus reddit? Way selfish.  someone doesn‚Äôt wear seatbelt, they‚Äôre endangering themselves.

What variants? Get people vaccinated

What long COVID? Get people vaccinated

What vaccinated going back normal? Get people vaccinated.

Israel never highly vaccinated. Instead complaining whining panicking taking engaging schadenfreude Americans do, least Israel actually working solution problem starting see results. America innovative country used people would rather posture emotions instead solving problems. Good news think blow unvaccinated crowd much quicker alpha hopefully means people get antibodies faster last year think missing point strictest enforcement nation, stricter NYC. üëç Yup, that's me.   say they're effective general populace, said perhaps fair get rest world vaccinated first boosting people. both, currently donated poorer nations twice many vaccines use.

Thursday afternoon lost sense smell taste. possible? text negative still symptoms virus? sure real political issue anymore point. I'm Democrat many democrat friends done masks. live left state refused make anything mask recommendation. People simply ready go lives think past point put one side party lines. No, what's silly, imo, politicizing basic safety.

For example: LAW, u cannot enroll ur kids school without certain vaccines. Polio, Rubella, Measles, Chicken Pox, etc.

They ""took away ur freedom"" strictly matter overall safety. Recall: u freedom shout FIRE crowded theater. concept absolute freedom silly never existed.

Oh oh why! Covid vaccine required school-attending children? freedom? Nope. worst hit spots typically low vaccination rates lax prevention measures, seeing worst cases among unvaccinated. reported quite bit. Yeah got samples immediately knew start spike protein SARS-Cov-1 &amp; think MERS-Cov too. hope gets approved vaxxed seniors well. CDC given warning age group high risk breakthrough infections cruises, possibly large-crowd events. normal day-to-day interactions still safe (especially booster) many 70 80 year olds want partake big family gatherings they're still physically &amp; mentally present. Asking miss another year weddings, bar mitzvahs, graduations sad. It‚Äôs also state leaders overruling local leaders, kinda hard square ‚Äúparty small government.‚Äù  arbitrary reason

Almost everything COVID policymaking nutshell. Boil water alert normal Florida. lot flooding, pipe bursts, large storms. There's limit amount oxygen divert. still safe enough wash drink boiling. painful side effect It‚Äôs insane. First deny virus, except it‚Äôs virus, don‚Äôt accept vaccine.

They sure smarter rest us. Couple raging mistrust government, end tragedy mass scale. Thank goodness no. FIL piece shit who's def racist lives Florida (guess voted for) anti-mask anti-vaccine...wears mask whenever needed vaccinated. feel need scream get violent towards people trying protect children, longer member team reality. Repost keep paying school left. That‚Äôs like saying would AOK Walmart take money paycheck even though shop exclusively Target Great plan, don‚Äôt want proven treatment give livestock dewormer instead 

Brilliant parents could let get it... :/  long covid exclusive covid. ME/CFS around hell longer time covid around. hell hearing stuff long covid worse stroke? contrary, I've heard several stories long covid patients improved and/or completely recovered.

Sometimes lingering effects happen viruses kidding think covid disease that. Gosh dammit. gonna shit show. Amazing post vaccine free healthcare Anecdotal daughter twice. February July year. statement actually correct, addition scientific logical would right time things June maybe part July. 

If see another dip back near zero October January, would also good time. 

Advising someone go cruise either level stupidity rarely achieved, actively malicious trying cause harm. That‚Äôs facts. risks increase number infections increase, chances incredibly magnified put people enclosed spaces extended period time, we‚Äôve seen time again. 

Freshly vaccinated people, boosters taken up, might make things November look like early summer. We‚Äôre near right now. absolute arrogance taking time expertise dozens medical staff hospitals poison centers stubborn admit don‚Äôt know shit. It‚Äôs stunningly sad. Hospitalizations really matters good measure serious illness, *which we‚Äôre trying prevent first place*. We‚Äôre trying prevent something akin sniffles common cold. truth matter *if you‚Äôre vaccinated* 14x *less likely* catch covid hospitalized die catch flu hospitalized die 2018-2019 flu season, statistically speaking. 

[CDC data 2018-2019 flu - 164 100,000 chance catching flu hospitalized dying it, assuming population 320 million.

[CDC data breakthrough - 12 100,000 chance catching covid hospitalized dying vaccinated. Assuming vaccinations began earnest April (5 months) extrapolating entire year, using vaccinated population 166 million.

**If vaccinated safe covid go living normal life** might little accurate outset, Delta variant changed everything. places 50%+ hospital admissions people 45 younger relatively normal health. dewormers, hydroxychloroquine, bleach, Lysol, blind faith prayer?

Complaints sick suddenly dropped zero test group No. Otherwise folks would make career getting fired.  inflected never good getting vaccine
