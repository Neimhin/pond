0,2021-05-09," Remind me! 6 months policy line data behind vaccines disease spread?

In perfect world keep wearing masks extremely low burden vaccines 100% effective. sucks 'best' option going, ""well, enough people give shit virus, able drop numbers low enough safely remove restrictions, remove even though cases/deaths remain pretty elevated alienate even larger percentage population."" know I'd go outside New England. pros outweigh cons me. handling pandemic, following science, basic human dignity things far many states lacking taste. I'll pay goddamn taxes. may well safety profile children age justify vaccination. It’s best prepare outcome. What's problem asking question exactly? obviously entirely topic. That's interesting, according [the BBC's third active cases vaccinated two doses, would suggest significantly lower efficacy. told HR guy I'm going return office vaccine policy put place enforced. think I'm going working remote forever. 1) pointed repeatedly thread, vaccinations attend schools way new concept.

2) There's something little insidious, unintentional, asking COVID vaccines ""the new norm"". agree vaccines around longer masks distancing, means vaccines key returning level normalcy prevalent longer people comfortable with. asking ""IS NEW NORM?"" they're ignoring is, extension, also *old* norm.

3) feels like phrase everyone using year ago figured could pique interest recycling it.  got “extreme” part right. It’s extreme wear masks indoors, especially cdc still recommends use. I’m calling shutdowns anything like that. What’s hard wearing mask?  realize may sound cynical put way, could say evolution finally caught religion?  think biggest hold outs necessarily GOP strongholds, ones large, rather inner cities poor/minority areas access severe reservations vaccinated always even reflect thoughts shots themselves. 
 
Which I'm glad Lamont like going force areas make sure anyone wants shot get it. It’s ten million doses, 1/9 total vaccines needed. would ironic? lot people incorrectly arguing last May actually makes sense May. Thats point. Cases went even without vaccines can't assume vaccines responsible current reduction. least wait summer see get continued progress surge like last summer. hospital pressure old ones deaths, contamination climb hospitals going even harder time... has. Pfizer shipping doses Michigan Mexico last week. going therapists hanging around CVS waiting people talk them? Money Pretty bad issue statistically would occured max around 330 people nation 330 million required week long pause almost completely nuked reputation vaccine otherwise quick option vaccinate large number people. move alone may add 50-70 days time takes get back life normal. Absurd, planet cali? disagree. Florida chosen basically ignore pandemic point fact multiple variants circulating means tourists become new sources spread home states. Put simply, Florida choosing pursue tourist dollars cost continued outbreaks America. That’s 300k CDC estimates. 1/3rd small business closing failure amount largely failure across country, Florida didn’t well regard, pretty average. claimed unemployment low, instead, it’s middle road losing ground. Basically, there’s metric I’ve seen shows Florida anything pedestrian middle road country, recovering faster country. made real estate claim somehow well real estate people moving terms, again, it’s actually well metrics, either. looks middling.

So, claiming skipping lockdowns solution red hot economy false: Florida better average. Yes sme fully vaxxed people die, particular old ones. Nothing unexpected.  ""What want?"" * *Beer* *
""When want it?"" * *Beer* * Yea that’s pretty inexcusable teachers vaccinated. Understandable parents want continue keep kids home (especially high risk kids), schools back. needle thin.  Large-sized people? That’s term? 70% zombies kill come next year... feel way Hepatitis? think I'd take business elsewhere. feel like remember shots hurting lot kid. think shots adult barely prick. Maybe sensitive kids? city last night felt pre-covid. voluntarily went gay bar though - would’ve cooler drag queen. never implied economics serve human lives, brought idea.

No, say that. pointing focusing wrong thing, brought ""economic fallout"". economy can't car thing pretty irrelevant still

As mentioned, point invalid use cars argue accept covid risk. responding statement Nearly everything risk associated it. Driving car? get accident.

I hope deliberately misinterpreting points, suspect might be. Take care problem unvaccinated people outnumber vaccinated people 2:1 don’t see changing time soon least enough get herd immunity. I’ve thinking mask mandates lot lately, despite fully vaccinated feel strongly don’t want indoors unmasked non-vaccinated people. realized basically 100% young children. able vaccinated, don’t think would worry do. able vaccinated, dropping mask mandates indoors makes indoor situations dangerous expose kids to. really think need get vaccines approved young kids ASAP, suspect lot opposition dropping mask mandates subside. Joe Rogan said immune I'm 60 went sauna one time! hand athletes talk show hosts, definitely hand people like Gottlieb. Agreed. take hit worst could happened.

If pause found J&amp;J lots instances blood clots etc, LOT damage would done vaccine trust instead J&amp;J(Look instance covering Vietnam War permanently damaged trust US government lies uncovered) PA 52.6% first dose hard support want us support efforts help India kind stuff goes on.   uptick restrictions lifted. science spoken go saying Florida basically failure saying they're average average pretty much every regard. it? 

And read article? definitely ""tear people moving Florida narrative shreds."" literally says people moving Florida others moving out. think it’s also older generations Europe remember times vaccines things. UK Spain older average USA well. Plus many problems certain communities subjected medical experiments government, case USA black Americans. Yes, breakthrough deaths vaccination. It’s one million chance though. Right? newsworthy. like CEO Frito-Lay saying expects Doritos variants near future. hope understand 'no masks required vaccinated people' stage. 'no masks required anyone' stage. Unvaccinated people comply raise hell privacy asked it. 

I would like see 7-day average nationwide deaths around 200 day get point, line bad year influenza, live without affecting daily lives. Right we're bouncing 3-4 times amount. Every one receipts copy Secret back small font. Especially since CDC already inched forward direction revoking masking vaccinated people outdoors.

Maybe I’m reading right, didn’t outright say vaccinated people don’t need mask outdoors? Well, fully vaccinated person isn’t going affect unvaccinated population. can’t expect people stay indoors forever sake people don’t care probably high-risk activities anyway, you’re fully vaccinated you’re pretty much safe regardless variants. weird hill die on.

I'm also confused made far attitude Singapore. Probably nicked blood vessel.
Nothing worry about! haven’t pushed, don’t know. guess he’s read anecdotal reports Moderna likely strong adverse reaction.  **Location : Belgium**

The death occurred Compostela nursing home Borsbeek, two patients infected Indian variant. One two patients, considered doctors fragile, survive.


After death, mayor decided quarantine nursing home. ""It known residents infected Indian variant. still carrying checks. virologists, easy give answer residents vaccinated"" , underlines Dis Van Berckelaer, mayor Borsbeek.


Virologist Marc Van Ranst reacted. ""In first wave, peak 100 deaths per day nursing homes. currently less one per day. thanks vaccination,"" said. waves VRT.


And virologist stressed value vaccination: ""It may 100% effective, far threshold.""


As Mr Van Ranst admits, vaccination may less effective variants. ""The figures show Indian variant perhaps 15% contagious English variant, contagious original virus."" exactly COVID... guys really see that? That's America's Ass  CT neither large extremely rural, CT excuse front pack. Israel really well now. far today 7 cases reported (although weekend numbers). total active cases 1000.  teen remember reading John Grisham Robert Ludlum novel CDC supposed unparalleled futuristic organization top tier researchers infinite funding.

It’s saddening see throughout pandemic incompetent ineffective bureaucracy. FYI friend, picked wrong flair - ""South &amp; SE Asia,"" ""Central &amp; East Asia"" scientist biopharma ""we developed this"" ""we developed that"" arguments sides idiotic. Every team every project I've ever worked career international. guarantee Americans working Pfizer vaccine Europeans working Moderna, etc, well numerous nationalities across multiple research sites several countries. Science, maybe defense R&amp;D, global endeavor.

Just venting here, personally! positivity rate really good indicator bad outbreak is. Right tests going people absolutely symptoms get tested regular basis part job.

The positivity rate really tells reliable case numbers are. starts getting high know case numbers probably low. difference 3% 4% telling.  without proper tools, without effort, right. Exactly. tell us hide basements today miniscule chance debris falling Chinese satellite could hit us. There's always acceptable level risk. Life goes on. Colorado (Where I’m at) rolling thousand far.

Vaccines get done, cannot assume you’re 100% immune you’re even fully vaccinated. It’s risk reduction. great news, im still baffled near half USA lazy, misinformed bothered board masks. 

I dont even notice mask anymore, like socks.

But plenty people vaccinated yet think nothing going change follow rules less. That's group we're talking - one knows big crowd is, there's question mind exists. stand corrected, years behind.

I thought old(ish) tech hey prescribe medicine well? Spit buddy Don’t know you’re getting downvoted. studies last summer, added CDC smallest fine droplets, aerosol particles formed fine droplets rapidly dry, small enough remain suspended air minutes pretty sure 49% people, adults. probably correlates something like 62% adults.

If look Singapore, even zero community cases, fully re-open. still cautious, rightly so. Didn’t seem stop attending concerts ?

think opportunity society improve. 

people refusing vaccine illegitimate reasons ostracized environments pose risk members society. allow minority hold rest country hostage?

I'm guessing including things extra 28 days waiting doses immunity, delays supply week two importantly increased hesitancy among population necessary get us closer low transmission.

Using dad example, set get JNJ shot early April. canceled week getting Pfizer dose. really pry get take work JNJ dose fell getting Pfizer/Moderna vaccine readily available walk-ins. would imagine like still holding out, could difference getting 70% next week next month state.

That said fact 1 dose seems rather effective two weeks anyway supply constraints week ago anyway, I'm sure first two really legitimate responses. question many would gotten JNJ vaccine refusing get mRNA jabs much effecting R0. point. I'm ready abandon mask cuz people it. Yet, look votes
I get it. little pressure roll vaccine quickly Australia. zero locally acquired cases today 2 past 7 days.

Interstate travel relatively open masks (depending state) generally mandatory public transport 2% Teddy Roosevelt carrier outbreak. 5% cases overall Colorado also consistent 2% infections. recall correctly, military already accidentally dropped nuclear bomb US... 100%, same. What? UK *did* end restricting AZ 40. Two individuals named inventors. original ownership rights, likely work Moderna agreed advance sell inventions exchange salary. Even happens inventors need sign applications. People invent things, legal entities. 

Lots people seem arguing governments steal inventions clever people. argument seems “because pandemic”, course inventions for. don’t steal industrial machinery flood, steal medicine? price cheap, afford it. Curious source list, one :) state hit 30%. don’t even want know county is! giving companies ""an incredible leg up"" kind imply helps capable manufacturing vaccine?

Perhaps relevant timeframe?

If takes year new company start producing mRNA vaccine scratch patents, would influence pandemic anymore. would make new competitor Biontech/Pfizer Moderna fot future. plan keep wearing mask full vaccination helps pass hate getting flu freaking summer reason dont wish anyone else context covid. else mean “healthier (and safer)?” Safer covid? India 22 million recorded births per year, far 240k recorded covid deaths total. two different orders magnitude Well clearly misread, rephrased statement changing include risks covid whereas mine included overall risks. said clearly.

That true anything I’ve read. Go Serbia  get really evil really quickly.

The vaccines work variants. Big agree Like therapist says: know better, better. always something doesn’t mean isn’t better way. Reminds movie Porkys Fear needles one questions asked, refused even confirm deny that. free part matter, money even offered incentive. rest that...I know experience passive aggression, especially little notes like that, either annoys people doubling stubbornness, escalates overt hostility. like think, though. even article says 40% want shot right now, whereas 1% actually receive one despite abundance doses available. Clearly vaccine hesitancy limiting factor currently. yet SF area people still wearing outdoors low density areas even though state county rules revised require last week.

I’m wearing mask I’m trying save lives, there’s going point break start refusing wear matter what, think I’m going approach point soon. There's another side coin people making fake vaccination cards, claiming vaccinated not. sad see, may keep bit longer. Sauron behind all! people don’t trust vaccines, put trust masks fascinate me.  important tool fighting pandemic, one thing clearly much effective people don’t seem realize that.

The vaccines highly effective, community spread high still important take swiss cheese approach engage things like masking distancing. unvaccinated person Australia New Zealand significantly safer COVID vaccinated person US need get community spread much stop masking. Maybe going eat. kids? They're vaccinated. That's safe. Ok, tough guy.  rate wet socks zero velvet pajamas 10, would give masks solid cotton polo shirt. Feels kinda like social pressure saying “adults good, let’s go back normal!”

It's complicated issue. I'm ok actual scientific arguments say kids less likely infected COVID adults, although I've also read reports argue ones get likely adults develop ""long COVID"". However, also extremely obvious many political leaders completely ignoring anything scientists say making plans whatever want. result, much faith example Texas live know many political decisions made bad faith. result, difficult trust exactly conditions would place kids safe, hopefully end long covid symptoms lasting long periods time. many people focus COVID deaths alone people either permanently changed deal long term problems result disease. Six gets infected, reasonable chance would spread rest us (despite vaccinated)?

Ffs. think point getting vaccinated is???  list (probably bad) ideas, assuming bunch young guys US:

Write rules people visit unvaccinated. Post front door. 

Signs say ""Warning, unvaccinated person lives here"", keep putting up.

Notes fridge ""for vaccinated people only""

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  definitely upsides behind (in UK, vaccine uptake incredibly high - 95% 50s, great POV preventing hospitalisations deaths). Rattling age groups quickly indicate diminishing demand vaccine. vaccine might work well example. stay home wear masks, course, there's still concern might come contact people interact (family members, friends, etc). Yeah, know get ""Japanese want get vaccinated"" information from, people upvoted that. everyone get vaccinated. Yes. 1% though? That's like one wanting vaccine... Wait till see hospital like. feel definitely explains lot vaccine hesitancy amongst healthcare workers. medical field, sort academic hierarchy existed longest time (MDs educated hard academic barriers entry RN, tech working there, etc). Pay tends stark differences medical field come it, resentment would definitely “smarty pants crowd”. country joke similar Europe. We're still vaccinating 50s Sweden too. months start vaccinating 20's. something learned pandemic mental health probably impacted long term physical health. Amongst survives course.  saying true, data showing postvaccine symptoms frequent covid vaccines vaccines, flu vaccine? literally based evidence laboratory tests real world evidence studies millions people Qatar India. 

At least read article going critique something think about.

Maybe time people addressed fearmongering last year managed inflict people, rather catering it? got Rexall waitlist ago, shoppers show availability area. 


I really appreciate taking time respond! I'll keep trying pharma pages, otherwise, I'll patiently wait turn :) Thanks again, friend. proven point Oh, totally understand - I've got pets too! 

But they're extremely unlikely get you, even unlikely anything mild symptoms. Yeh I'm also definitely 25%. fairly socially active pandemic massively so. I've wfh leaving house shopping etc everyone else. feel particularly sad anxious, really missing anyone since live GF I've caught everyone else Zoom whatever. It'll nice go pub fine can't while. ok whole time, bit inconvenienced shops closed etc mostly fine.

I feel sad people trouble getting though. Hopefully they'll able improve mental health state lockdown over. wtf. donate south them. Philippines here. proven that, can't prove wrong, 🤷‍♂️ “Freelancer designer”. technically true. point brew two new MacBook Pro’s. Thank God countries requiring proof. Rather go Iceland Florida. part 25%. given commute, work trips, socializing work people friends acquaintances dramatically time wife kids. literally didn’t even go store eat outside restaurant whole time vaccination, it’s still easy choice me. used basically work Mon-Fri really lived life weekends. Now, despite working hours before, every day live life family. Easy choice. clearly ethical issue, can’t see enough cause significant delays shortages. variants vaccine might cover? original advice stop buying masks masks ineffective outside clinical setting. guess we'll find right bodies get stacked. think going change people's minds calling stupid, one who's stupid.

You'd thought anyone age 18 would realised that. There's copious data last five years particular.

tbh though, videos like Kimmel's intended actually educate anyone. They're designed form virtue signalling like-minded people.  we're going able hit herd immunity

We never ever going herd immunity. Covid stay, like flu. ***Affecting several dozen diabetes patients infected Covid also take specific drug diabetes

The fear porn never fucking ends Nah lets hold glorified touch sporting event invite athletes world participate amidst continuing pandemic. would talk doctor. Maybe suggest getting blood draw vaccination see platelets going further. good part rare low platelet side effect treatable. wouldnt avoid completely reason. Covid cause clotting/low platelets, much higher rate vaccine. never risk dying COVID Good, need boosters, way it. Sharing caring :-)   know Midwest sure Midwest they’re plummeting.

I checked they're right, missed point. Anyone links HPV side effects? Google show much. Whatever you’re trying assign Japan “conservative” progressive Democratic Party America. They’re socially conservative lot ways, yes, people say conservative America equate meaning another country’s politics gives young people wrong idea. Japan like American “conservative” society stretch imagination you’ve spent considerable time like I’d assume you’d well aware that. disturbing try imagine strangling baby elephant sounded like find crazy lot prominent African American athletes weary getting vaccinated aren’t accused “anti vaxxers” yet others are. IMHO ethnicities people tested government experimental medicines government. weary government vaccine shouldn’t basis race, based facts. Winsted. 

Probably never even heard it. Poorest town entire state, least opinion. 

CT pushing poor people state decades taxing shit low income folks. 

Lamont doesn’t want poor people CT, actions made abundantly clear. live time unprecedented numbers entertainment choices home. Electronic TV games like Nintendos Sonys, etc. Net-Flix, Amazon Prime, Apple Video, etc.

I news you: stuff make people happy. might feel pleasurable first, eventually, leaves us feeling empty hollow, wondering there's life. best, things numb pain loneliness, take away; real, face-to-face relationships that. Social isolation loneliness cause serious mental physical health problems, I'm tired people downplaying negative effects. bother precautions required. event unique Japan, *everybody* got fucked bad blood 80s. fact happened Japan explain abnormal vaccine hesitancy today. think news reports one vaccine companies (Pfizer?) offering vaccine participants. Perhaps alternative cancelling Olympics close borders un-vaccinated. doubt problems approach, show alternative involve problems.

The Japanese government still address spread population. That's irrelevant point, recently falling slowly. 

Also, failed answer question. answer no, logical say 24% decrease ""plummeting"" context. Seems like really read fully understand posted decided get something never said. Im trying ignore tragedy shitty pop music. key word ""fully"" vaccinated. Canada sitting 2.68%, despite public wanting vaccine.

Main reason government decided wanted extend second dose 4 months first one, people eligible yet Yeah, looking one asian individual Pfizer getting sick, zero moderna.

Look counting noise. There's literally nothing read difference. event number low draw conclusion. Excelsior pass NYC something similar. wonder controlled got vent ... cause vent alone could cause long term damage, understand. right? literally aren't. making stuff up? America it’s bafflingly easy area. America huge though baffling Texas well distributing vaccinations. I’m sure states I’ve heard similar things friends family ease vaccinated. 

I told go online register vaccination. Emails texts sent unison. people got vaccine first determined age occupation. you’re young never leave home you’re getting someone who’s older works public. 

When got email text took website schedule appointment. picked location, day, time, vaccine wanted. location think one vaccine brand, pick vaccine first. got second text today scheduled second appointment. 

It drive thru location well. kept 15 30 minutes depending risk factors. cost whole process quick easy. 

I’m rather surprised hear European nations issues us comes giving vaccines. stepdad GB got vaccine soon possible per doctors recommendations it’s really one percent?? lmao sure link something language can't read. nice thing would link language communicating that's fine, work you. Efficacy degree vaccine prevents disease, possibly also transmission, ideal controlled circumstances – comparing vaccinated group placebo group. Effectiveness meanwhile refers well performs real world. (First Vaccine efficacy/effectiveness interpreted proportionate reduction disease among vaccinated group. 90% indicates 90% reduction disease occurrence among vaccinated group, 90% reduction number cases would expect vaccinated. (Section 6.2 paragraph Rather, 95% vaccine efficacy means instead 1000 COVID-19 cases population 100 000 without vaccine (from placebo arm abovementioned trials, approximately 1% would ill COVID-19 99% would not) would expect 50 cases (99·95% population disease-free, least 3 months) (Paragraph 2). 



So yes stand stand paragraph here: vaccinated with, let's say, CoronaVac (Sinovac) get 67% protection symptomatic Sars-Cov-II, 33% cases get rona become symptomatic good chances mild inconvenience sick days week, unvaccinated people close still catch rona you, put serious danger.

Is factually wrong horrifyingly worded. idea which, interpretation gives people protected 67% 33% catching disease every time get contact virus. 

Again, wrong immunity works. Vaccine efficacy/effectiveness statistical tool measuring immunity across population. chance people develop immunity following vaccine within time period measured. 

The difference efficacy effectiveness simply control observation conducted. Efficacy controlled trials whereas effectiveness within general population controlled. think elderly mostly complying restrictions tho, people getting infected mostly younger people either ignore restrictions employer forces come office. spoke Fema volunteers administering shots mentioned vaccine data sent state also federal level... pretty positive info. old ""smoking sections"" prompted comment. restaurant first time 14 months weekend mixing everyone together. UK here. Got letter post doctor telling get booking fucking vaccine. 

Phone up, booked vaccine. Got vaccine 2 days later. 

Generally difficult. might actually *possible* give satisfying explanation everyone. 

It's possible, least current climate. people hesitant baseline understanding, better explanation might make difference. even hearing explanation completely understand feels better hearing ""do say know better you."" Someone trying explain instead saying can't explained it.

I agree - people need trust science come conclusion experts agreeing, need listen trust. mechanic tells intake manifold cracked, demand see it, demand explanation is, function car cracked first place - mechanic explain little anyway - listen understand, nod along politely starts going details can't follow ultimately tell ""do need - here's credit card!"" fix 10 mechanics around walking it, ""here owe me"" literally information actually need! lol - little explanation makes price tag feel bit better! depressing common scenario people trusting scientists! right understanding science trusted exist many people. hoping (naively obnoxiously optimistically) people see science right vaccine safe effective, may open trusting science. agree right answer ""trust experts scientific method"" many people right simply trust hesitant reason. data looking at? Right still average 40k cases day, July 2020. still way higher March/April 2020 levels (100 30k cases). announce things based feeling, he's scientist public health official. data shows safe, that's CDC change guidance. Turkey, 2 weeks ago started vaccinating 55-60 cohort. minister announced Twitter announcement made coincident evening news programs announced immediately pretty much major TV channels. Turkey book appointment state owned hospital family clinic, separate vaccination clinics sufficient capacity clinics hospitals worked well far.

However state owned hospitals use central booking system called MHRS apparently public facing staff-facing systems share central system. 55-60 cohort opened whole system crashed shortly announcement everyone tried book appointment. book appointment father online called hospital said system also crashed pretty much anything. point? Happened Germany, too. opted get hospitalized precaution, negative effects (other normal vaccine effects) observed quickly left hospital next day so. VbX Disallowing smoking due hazards exist time it. SCMP owned AliBaba. SCMP say things like bring CCP, generally portray China negatively. Like point give Hong Kong protesters favorable coverage throughout 2019. saw article recently said Japan also prioritizing elderly first plans everyone else vaccinated September.

That exactly everyone it. High-risk first - medical workers, elderly, work backwards age groups. 4M shots medical workers given, halfway (4M workers need 2x shots). 341k shots given general risk higher younger women interesting see opposite -- many people dropped risk prevention pretending already 2019 levels safety. agree arguments circumstances describing seems foreign experience.

Overall think lot good lost CDC last year. Remember confusing discussions mask-wearing beginning pandemic? recent information CDC admitted COVID airborne? Even someone pays attention science hard know much actual risk things are. result, understand people extremely cautious kids. going take time lot people become comfortable reducing precautions. mind getting stinkeye every I'm unmasked park. Things opening up, people getting vaccinated, whether everyone goes along momentum bring end pandemic restrictions go along it. much effective respirator? much effective respirator? peak reddit said weren't? Vaccines open people America. good chance dining vaccinated.  India's 2nd wave example compounding effects. many things went wrong. People stopped distancing wearing masks. Religious festivals Holi Kumbh Eid went back pre Covid days. Protests, Political rallies... People stop crowding India fear Law enforcements, never self realisation. Weird. thought Japan one smart countries this. So, obviously knowledge crimes humanity are, punishment process would work. That's fine - take care mental health. pandemic rough us all. Blame pitchforks feel like give respite, don't, long term. Therapy great option. Great point. kids 18 make 21% population America. that’s huge! There's number annoying people self-absorbed they've turned masking form theatre instead public health measure.

Whenever talk CDC Fauci comes starting phase compulsory masking vaccinations rise jump chance talk much love mask they're going wear forever.  way official numbers near accurate metric. Bang-on!

So, UK variant, Brazilian, South African Indian one..?! geo-tagged countries one saying 'Wuhan variant 'instead SARS-Cov -19??

Isnt began?? would lied operation beforehand thing happened Oxford/AZ Europe. Sure, company messed production capacity trial data, vaccine incredibly effective. bad news comes that's people read. Exactly science thus far says mask needed vant put 5G blood Melbourne (second biggest city) experiencing 500 cases day 3 month lockdown. Basically everything shut. put guarded ring around Melbourne let through. shut state borders (which unprecedented far I'm aware).  
The government paid people stay home. crushed it. 

That closed borders mandatory 2 week hotel quarantine returning Aussies. hospital full not. know fully vaccinated people wear masks considering eye protections. kid can’t vaccinated yet. Telling people take masks starting going back pre-pandemic lives full blessing CDC get vaccinated carrot.

A big-ass carrot that. keep pretending like vaccines work asking people continue masking lowers faith creates apathy towards getting one. Oh ok sure think mean *socialist satanic cultist micro chips It’s responsibility protect anti-vaxxers. catch it, tough shit. Remind what? they’re gonna ok year? Chill mods, need protecting us every negative thought... Wait infection numbers drop outside almost zero covid countries, letting large amounts people. That's likely happen since exception Singapore 'zero-covid' countries first queue vaccination.  going absolutely destroy immune system line thinking. need regularly encounter peoples’ “nasty germs” keep functioning well. depends availability. Ontario, Canada, hot spot they're still 40 (this quite recent well). Also spaced second shots to, believe, 4 months later. got bad side effects vaccine (Pfizer): quickly symptoms hit?

It’s really big deal- legally required outdoors situation, simple rational, neighborly thing do. I'm New Zealand, really consider 'in jail'. Maybe jail excellent scenery. Nope, typo. underestimated amount people there's high uptake. Ok, lack vaccines makes sense. However, vaccines available health staff doesn’t take it, fired. weeks Indian outbreak starting gather real pace UK *finally* closing borders essentially bordering India. RemindMe! One year 106%? typo something number counted? Ummm, yeah? people getting vaccine, less chance contracting covid physically physically incapable getting vaccine. much India needs hard lockdown good luck country 1.3 billion people density 1,000 people per square mile. 

Especially large swaths like dozen people packed one dwelling We’ll check year time two person needed quarantine. mistake; friend said ""lockdown coming soon"", hopefully that's inevitability. imported labor issue certainly pickle, least seems like government something it. yeah, heard rollout slow, seems case Asia generally. Apparently Japan's 3 months 0.9% vaccination rate..?!

Anyway best guys ;) definitely sensible say Sinovac LOL clarify, here's quote: 
""I want Sg stop fucking lol
Lockdown coming soon""

But, responses I'm getting, guys mostly okay, terrible like Japan's handling it, that's good. can't wait visit :)  Thank please hurry definitely influenced France, Flanders regards Netherlands right ?

Yes, would make sense indeed. idea related antivaxx influence France pet theory, might due different reason.

I hope still turn around get vaccination rate entire country. I'm quite worried vaccination rates younger people much lower (like already shaping US, example). do, fewer fewer dying industry.

Journalists graduates field consider learning code back plan. That's ridiculous. booked holiday abroad months get sick week? cancel flight possibly lose hotel bookings got unlucky? Great discussion Ah okay makes sense, thanks clarifying. :) BioNTech plans open Singapore office initiate construction manufacturing facility 2021, subject planning approval. Company anticipates site could operational early **2023** create 80 jobs Singapore.

I hope, speed little. here. can't get funk. I’m CT. people know vaccine hesitant first got it. made difference? kids holding grandkids hostage “you hug grandson you’re fully vaxxed” strong incentive. Dr. Fauci said (USA) closer 910K deaths underreporting blame. People either incapable reporting correctly political reason. Happens everywhere world politician dictator. Hahahaha see entirely accurate. 5-8% chance getting infected rather chances reduced 90-95%. Remember tens thousands people phase 3 trials even 200 got COVID, like .02% participants got sick. 180 got COVID, like 8 vaccinated rest placebo group, 95% saw come chance getting infected rather reduction risk vs someone vaccinated.   Again, wound greatly sir. know take another withering bite wit. Yes estimate whole Belgium (from I've read heard trusted sources).

We definitely influenced France, Flanders regards Netherlands right ? worry much looks, clear cognitive deficiency prevents engaging proper risk assessment inability engage sort nuance.  Especially outdoors. risk non vaccinated person spread covid outdoors already small, fully vaccinated risk must almost zero. actually heeding advice limit spread march 2020 almost universal compliance, relatively lower population density, restricted international travel, generally healthier outdoor lifestyles, welfare support, name few. think significant chunk population wearing masks pretty begrudgingly moment. that’s say nothing, course, proportion population isn’t wearing all. 

Taking present acquiescence around mask-wearing Covid extrapolating permanent imperative obvious me. lot them, rough estimate 20%, want get vaccinated.

I believe that's estimate Belgium whole.

This nursing home Flanders, willingness get vaccinated much higher areas country. (Might related French-speaking areas influence antivaxxers France? 100% sure.)

For anyone curious vaccination rates Belgium, see here: everyone 65 normally got offered vaccine, yet case younger ages (although everyone works nursing home got offered one already). fully vaccinated necessary mean can't catch still affect still transmit it. thought US good looked Florida god. people would rather infect potentially kill someone Covid worship safely home maintain distancing. ritual worship, turned ritual death  country sooooo slow. speed vaccinated winter Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

The real answer probably combo factors. Different trials slightly different definitions symptomatic COVID, possible AZ's trials allowed barely symptomatic cases included analysis, would tend depress efficacy slightly. AZ probably better longer interval, specifically trialed (though post hoc subgroups showed might better option), shorter interval used would tend drag trial efficacy well. probably importantly, real-world analysis based one dose; totally possible AZ mRNA vaccines fairly equivalent 1 dose, 2nd dose mRNA vaccines brings efficacy 90+% range, whereas AZ stays bit lower. However, AZ appears effective preventing serious outcomes, difference particularly notable. idea conservatives think - idea media tells conservatives think.

It’s one masks don’t make meaningful difference.

Your argument rooted unfounded distrust vaccines. effectiveness monumental breakthrough medicine. It’s critical clear vaccines end pandemic. happen quickly get people vaccinated. advocate unnecessary restrictions vaccinated people, signal many it’s worth get vaccine. leads longer pandemic greater illness death.

Not true. last 6 days, nearly 5 million people US got first shot. (If want say that's fault waiting, that's another story)

That's pretty significant number, compared 32.5 million covid cases across entire pandemic. Exactly. It’s like loading golf ball onto Atlas V rocket saying proved it’s possible hit golf ball orbit. Winds Neo-Tokyo,

I’ve heard biggest fault EU educating people purpose functionality, heard comparison Europeans know American politics EU. curious perspective ground not. American exposure EU obviously limited don’t seek out. 

Of course solidarity makes sense. unified Europe every nation ordering themselves? said, it’s clear structure EU needs tweaking. failed everyone due indecision bureaucracy, whereas individual nations willing act decisively. It’s unfortunate see EU fail way, since I’ve always high hopes long term success. Hopefully causes restructuring abandoning current EU process. I'm Germany get vaccinated tomorrow. local authorities recommend single shot people recovered Covid, September last year.

Unfortunately, need travel lot work know need visit countries likely care ""recovered single shot"" persons like bureaucracy...

I'm scared side-effects second dose recovered person. do? literally said “just you’re fully vaccinated, doesn’t mean suddenly immune covid-19.” I'm talking vaccinated, get coronavirus, employer group employees vaccinated... multiple people get sick, stands pretty good chance traced back given place - especially general numbers come down.

Japan would running Olympics big loss. get Japan want host it, put money it. But, think things go ahead, pretty bad look Japan Olympics. B cells produce antibody. cells directly attack infected cells (among things)

They work concert knock infection out. Antibodies block infection high enough titer first place. cells stop cells already infected continuing contribute infection. organized Japan usually stuff, it’s strange vaccines aren’t getting administered faster? I've read experts Twitter, preliminary testing suggests likely worse P1 B1315  sore arm happens quickly think, could faster expect

But don’t think you’ll feeling feverish time blindly trusting vaccines? even mean? Vaccines saved billions lives since invention never widespread consequences. 

Even beloved Donny got it. open immediately without 40s, get huge increase cases. nice argument, mask fanatic always pick people never well Math posts. 

Deaths weekly average 950 April 1. see 662 average yesterday. That’s 30% decrease.

2. first glance seems bit disappointing considering believe Pfizer studies deaths among fully vaccinated individuals. Given, talking prob unvaccinated individual dying covid \* 3% small number would hard find limited study population. 

3. death reduction 69% probably lower one would expect population fully vaccinated people got COVID. people likely immune compromised population unvaccinated people got COVID. Yeah one something need figure figure quickly. Great news! Anyone know much move needle? (No pun intended).

A important nuance missing attempt insightful. oh wait…. nononononono. AZ Pfizer platform moderna platform … no. that…. means vaccines effective… work. farce. platforms close.

This worse thing govt could do.   India actually fewer total doses per day via Bloomberg's tracker, incorrect there. current rate would take 2.5 years reach immunity.

Israel slowed vaccinations much they're 6k day estimated 16 months immunity.

Canada, despite enough vaccines contract cover population three times over, administered half doses US point.

The US best considering scale, speed % population vaccinated. think they're going get much population vaccinated. reasons this:

* Mississippi, Alabama Louisiana (aka, ""the deep south"") vaccination rates mid-30% range 
* rate number delivered states begun leveling last weeks
* states begun declining bulk vaccine allocation, understand evidence arms put doses
* Moreover, ""number people one shot"" seems catching ""number people fully vaccinated"", implying they're running new people wanting shot

Assuming factor (I dunno, like substantial number people waiting June get vaccinated reason), leads think they're going left substantial population without immunity.

I applied thinking New England California, places vaccinations levels 50% range climbing. suggests they'll relatively people without immunity.

Of course, another user pointed wild card many people states already sick. something like 4x number reported cases, might enough people natural immunity avoid serious outbreaks. important remember covid happen bubble, restrictions impacted aspects life well. Less people driving equals less car deaths, flu deaths basically disappeared, etc. moderate-politically-aligned US citizen, would like point relief come via Biden.

I know people can't grasp surveying anything political US basically pointless. yes, vaccine unfortunately political US. can't imagine state holding back beyond day lag time get approvals place. risk claimed virologists time chance runaway mutation would higher, fortunately materialize.

Which always seemed top given vaccines even one dose higher effectiveness people thought would have. Would said adminster vaccines 60% effective two doses reason, around ballpark many expecting first vaccines? get it. Republic Ireland definitely UK. depends supply area, countries yet supply fully vaccinate whole population opted try prioritize vulnerable populations first first time long time optimistic.. love Dr FAuci one conservative guys yesterday said may able go masks inside places soon.. jumping down.. kind data projection must seen make proclamation must really strong.. people really jump vaccines truly want freedoms back want pandemic many others don't. Poor countries facilities produce mRNA vaccines, there's way ensure quality control could result badly made product reduces confidence them, removes incentive pharmaceutical companies make future.

But EU going made bad guy again, despite supplying rest world since beginning year. heartbreaking 600 people dying daily I'm comparing January. Cases deaths way down. Jobs returning, things reopening. faster people get vaccinated see numbers go near nil months. nominate US hold rag-tag, thrown together, Olympics here. Require vax. vax = watch, play. cdc sign it? Wish they'd faster scheduled meeting 13th. truffling development. don’t believe so. think right. seems big concern government announced pay families people dying vaccine around $400.000
 care others wear masks covid, care others care plan wear masks beyond covid.

People generally pro mask always ask ""why?"" someone says want mask over, get offended counter question. Send India, Russian friends. I'm pleasantly surprised well Poland 25% vaccinated given poorer country. think Germany help Poland latter's vaccination campaign? going become available CDC holds Advisory Committee meeting. Well certainly ""love Olympics"", time want delay stop spread virus global pandemic. Great news! Wonder day administration 12-15 year olds start TL/DR: vaccine works advertised Oh miss days got Bergen county shore like 45 minutes. I’ll take traffic good sign. Wow almost like vaccines work incredibly well cdc sign it? Wish they'd faster scheduled meeting 13th. Um... Read original comnent again. never said ""wearing mask properly prevents getting COVID..."".

I'm sorry 4th Grade failed you, reading ability stopped thereafter. right, forgot already. felt guilty even thinking us seeing mother law last year. buy stock oxygen generator mobility scooter companies export ban per se. Defense Production Act applied several key suppliers. act requires priority rating domestic orders. excess supply, exports absolutely allowed. is. Honestly might help reread first reply breakthrough case data difference spring last one. implied things similar year last refuted shared anecdotal data doesn’t track professional collected data. help? Wrong. Try even contagious diseases largely stopped too. COVID-19 nothing measles. I’m pretty sure didn’t say going die hill. Came ask input making rule. I’m open revising more/better info (and told kiddo so). definitely take point proximity, I’ve read studies high viral load saliva. I’ve also read higher viral load higher risk serious infection. That’s I’ve basing rule on, I’m definitely open revising based learning more. don’t want make rule; want protect kid ways make sense.

Edit: extra word Yes, use reddit news surprised bad...

This whole pandemic, see day day exactly at, internationally, nationally, state wide, county wide, hospital many places. graphs lie. Headlines reporting numbers trivia. Biden called 70% adults, 70% people. link survey?

I found this, data March sure something recent. Heh, sure point out, people making personal choice ≠ government restrictions. already posted Reposts removed. It’s absolutely going moved sooner, made clear since day announced. announcement literally said situation continued improve would move up. clearly going conservative promise deliver strategy. obsession date weird. would never downvote someone opinion, strongly disagree people favor keeping restrictions (including masks) place than, say, another month most. I'm neither anti-vax right-leaning, simply logical assessment situation fully vaccinated individual followed guidelines religiously since last March, including still wearing mask required. 

I believe summer 2021 still worried risk covid, either A) stay inside house indefinitely covid become pretty tiny risk areas country shrinking day, life tons risks similar severity, B) get vaccinated ""can't"" catch either. both. Either way, problem anymore.

Happily, I'm starting finally see support idea people smarter am. I've arguing point sub weeks now, perhaps jumped gun pushed early. here's Gottlieb's opinion today think we're point time start lifting ordinances wholesale fashion people take precautions based individual risk,"" Gottlieb said ""Face Nation."" ""They judge individual risk decide whether they're going avoid crowds wear masks based circumstances."" It’s historic abuse government healthcare professionals. would trust groups something like ten million, sixty million. 50 million produced next month.

The Astrazeneca vaccines US stockpile proven safe. came Emergent faculty caused problems Johnson Johnson vaccine.

The FDA conducting safety review, US says export entire stock shown safe.

It would pretty bad export bunch vaccines even emergency use authorization US, discover quality problems. butts it. actually form science denial. cautious personally fine, advocating policy line data behind vaccines disease spread ok. Polling also shown optimism potential return normal causes largest increase vaccine acceptance. Ironically overly cautious restrictive actually increases risk overall population. already posted Reposts removed.    Polio spread well Covid also far debilitating disease.

They chose national-socialists open rest World immigration anti national-socialist beliefs. us fully vaxxed people. Yes please 

It’s time Nope extra pay. live 3 nurses extra pay incentive. 

What hospitals paying extra town people travel work. everyone quitting hospital travel somewhere else money. Problem non-vaccinated idiots lie go unmasked, spreading around crowds again. vaccinated adults mostly ok exposed, people (and kids) can't get vaccinated. overall case numbers become much rare really good exposure start again. agree, also prepared it. 2 weeks first dose decent immunity, crowded area + bar + strangers seems like non zero risk. going tell do, personally would skip easy skip. Waiting year normalcy, getting sick weeks end may bummer. Okay, thanks! able anything least Thursday. I'll look it! parents said Costco nearby J+J past week Moderna week, might JJ left over. 1, quite. Society does, extent, balance *life* death--although even obviously must err side *saving* lives living exactly way want. Economic factors must service humans, never actual goal. last checked, money think harder, feel deeper, bleed redder people.

2, many different levels types risk. risk covid far higher level--there periods winter surge ***the #1 killer*** Americans--and different type, uniquely preventable. Ever since vaccines shown highly effective, we've known could lower risk spreading covid basically nothing waiting enough people get vaccinated.

Also, cars actually great example. Building American cities around car, forcing everyone drive one removing personal freedom choose, historically terrible decision. opinion piece interesting: Airplanes, also mentioned, far better safety profile cars.  basically real life Tropico? Yes, it’s weird include two three states hit figure neighboring New England states VT. hate it’s become political point today’s climate. Colleges required vaccines years; it’s health issue, political one. Remindme! 30 days PM crisis pay price take responsible . 
or join hands china🤔 virus even widespread lot states last summer. Cases much lower, deaths same. cases fewer deaths now, that's huge victory.

Things getting better. Right. That’s exactly I’m looking for. tell think bad science-based rule? Tuskegee Study poster child one. Human beings always horrible accurately assessing risk, pandemic put spotlight. People get nervous flying get nervous hopping car, even though risk dying car crash way higher dying plane crash. personally wouldn’t go 2 weeks second shot least, least protection 2 weeks first shot, absolutely can’t get obligation.

Just remember take work day two second shot get it. dumb. Cases dropped half last month (abruptly interrupting looked much like beginning new surge) got 60% vaccinated first dose. I'm really disappointed slow they've update messaging line ever-changing level risk. good anyone. good vaccination rate, good society, good peoples' mental health...  Yes. you’re allowed say here. doesn’t, anyone tells that, spewing bro science. Different bodies react differently different things. fact, argument could made immune system may stronger little side effects, conversation another time like article says, doesn’t really matter.  weren’t Canada mandatory 14-day quarantine returning travellers, would’ve flown Seattle get vaccinated. bear mind wanting pandemic get back times completely ignores reality times people sucked.

Certainly “stark” like you’re claiming. might people saying genuinely saying planning wear mask rest Lol, maybe *finally* year later, ""lockdown protest"" would *actually* make sense. That'd ironic. curious able mix vaccines. got J&amp;J severe health anxiety pause devastating me. Finally feeling better things won’t lie, I’m going hesitant get J&amp;J booster.

That’s way they’re wired. definitely don’t want kid hate me; want make rules keep safe based science. study saying anything close implying. comparing Florida Illinois comment. see according article correct. Thanks sharing. I’m curious too. could’ve sworn looking study suggesting natural immunity give immunity similar vaccine effectiveness says lot kid rather saying “ok” breaking rule, they’re mad rule. won’t break it; mad me. doesnt work mobile, change settings hover mouse state, see %of adults one dose Tax refund vaccinated. surely kick start campaign. 4 lakh = 400,000. 




*Dear India, one else world uses “lakh”. * (Hypothetical numbers) efficacy drops 90% need booster now? wait next year drops 85%, especially cost administration taken account? wait another year? Pharma say vax soon booster. makes call? issues never getting people take shot, shitty logistics planning mostly. conservative percent delivered doses using beginning, made sense since trusting previous federal administration deliver little iffy. picked amount using February. tons website issues phone number schedule rolled seniors, still getting shots arms. disaster try book appointment. taking people hours get website work, crashed bunch, etc. websites work better phone number too. CT residents get walk appointments Mohegan Sun. I've fully vaccinated since March points false positives taking real cases? dont know current rates used around 1% false positives? definitely case sometimes. state (Arizona), governor already went ahead voided restrictions businesses several weeks ago, reactions interesting disparate. businesses gyms/fitness scrapped everything immediately. Like literally next day transformed back 2019, distancing stuff, tables full sanitizer, mask signs, etc. disappeared overnight. businesses restaurants took slightly cautious approach, leaving distancing stuff place, plexiglass tables, ""masks recommended"" signs, etc.  others big box stores offices changed nothing - distancing stuff still place, masks required enter, plexiglass, air filtration, capacity limits, parts still closed (like dressing rooms, pools), etc.

It's going take bit time culture shift back. end comes people - organizations responding feel people want hear. Many people ready go back normal yet, better worse. parents fully vaccinated months still really rejoined world, still want us wear masks visit mostly outside, go anywhere crowded, etc. think get CDC, media, government, etc. start telling people something closer truth level risk that's right developing, people start coming around. PA passed 65% adults one dose yesterday mean Pfizer Moderna already clinical trials 2 years old 11 years old right now. Unless find trial sign child probably already closed off. little selfish least bring chances catching/spreading massively. goes family friends. I'm also trying catch spread it. Also I'm far away top vaccination list it'll probably summer offered me. say lazy that's kinda true I've fortunately managed keep job far still silly commute go it. Honestly say better everyone UK 70k excess deaths 2020 made dent housing market. Plus conservative government decided prop even new policies encourage low deposit mortgages. saying people need motivated beyond ""it saves lives"" probably save enough lives warrant cost taxes going rise pay extra debt country gotten need work.    don’t think he’s opposed hospital pharmacies, retail pharmacies (eg, Walgreens/CVS/Rite Aid). Probably feels comfortable hospital setting case anything goes wrong. I’m conferring directly him, sure.

At least he’s working home going except limited grocery store trips, masks up. he’s really big risk others. could cry happiness honestly, it’s starting feel real people lives lives again. think there's bigger fear response denial. Well yeah, 50,000 people living one state makes sense OK. Last time checked summer end 22 *September*. Sounds like good way get kid hate kiss whenever you’re around going follow rule.... So, might well accept kid fully vaccinated, safe ever be. That's another popular meme among brigaders. come from? literally never heard anyone say that, except back March 2020 idea going happen. Even now, leadership saying ""two weeks"". *are* saying we're clearly getting closer end, see signs. can’t forget Florida! I’m thinking sometime June maybe like late June trickles states week two. Similarly called April 19th day eligibility vaccines opened everyone. honestly wasn’t confident saw interview morning cause Fauci clearly seeing data making confident vaccine effort. think they’ve also started realize trying hammer home vaccinated people shouldn’t engage high risk behavior driving vaccine hesitancy. guess Washington Post shows NH 68.7% now. 

There something wonky data little while, seems fixed now. went 100% vaccines used one point. little lower list. may showed 70% point don’t think actually case, problems reporting data. raw material export ban fiction deployed propaganda countries whose vax campaign poor like France India. think depressants anything, least acute short term use. Alcohol however causes ton immediate inflammation offsets sorts normal bodily functions unrelated pharmacology related chemistry. metabolic by-product acid, disrupting normal acidity blood, among variety issues causes. would want go away raking billions? Nice. white state front. Screw black southern states. Canada rich country US helping poorer ones like Mexico Central America. CT would get 99% vaccination rate. thought talking Midway airport first confused. rich white people getting vaccinated. Exactly. none mandates dropped yet. anti-maskers anti-vaxxers don’t comply mandate anyway. I've wondering well. declines we've started see seem happening exactly time last year. proof meningitis vaccination go college. vaccinated tetanus leave country study abroad. one fucking hard people?  quite - positivity rate lower  Yeah, doubt that. think important factor already saw hard hit countries... summer. Poisson Rouge Bleecker Manhattan used pre-covid. assume (they closed, they?) plan global trade stops? Several western countries produce enough food population. enough people vaccinated, lose things. Again. again. mean, point what, hoping time next .5 million die medicine found cure? coronavirus? 

You're comparing two different groups compared. There's little preventative measures available groups mentioned. absolutely prioritized. isn't. many people die year things combined? got 85,000 drunk driving drug overdoses. Risky sexual behavior? really sure. 

This far preventable things, (besides STDs, suppose) contagious. 

A good enough portion country prolonged following mandates continuing spread virus killed, again, half million people, excluded everyone many areas participating life. 

It sucks aware mass suffering caused virus, correct? much every angle. think justifies this. think part full formal approval ability advertise direct consumers. Get ready it! natural immunity, really need get ~80% vaccinations - difficult - want prevent wave. transcript [1], Dr. Gottlieb look San Francisco, 20 cases day, 70% population vaccinated. good testing place. need mask ordinances indoors anymore certainly outside.

Meanwhile, Mayor Breed says SF may follow state fully reopening June. [2]

Where vacation summer?

[1] CEOs beholden shareholders raise company's stock value something. Imagine one said ""No, world need product future."" would board member vote next day, new CEO saying we'll need annual booster vaccines formulas variants well talk promising work common cold vaccine, even work started yet. wanted say exchanges like one /u/TheWinks makes reddit good. Legit question, thoughtful answer, civil. Sadly, yes. That's actually good point. see ads nearly every break ED, heart this, diabetes that, see maybe one ad day COVID vaccines, CDC. pharma companies' ad dollars need them? not?

Too many dummies think they'll microchipped something, might well let others come get them. enough that. average one infected person infecting 3 people. 70 percent vaccinated, number people infected person gives virus logically drop one person average. That’s we’ll start see huge drops case numbers, evidenced hospitals seeing similar drops cases among staff reached threshold Alright.  don’t show pics beach, spread. Show bars, restaurants parties hotel rooms. Right, risk variant escape, we'll cross bridge come it. now, country gets people vaccinated cases basically go away, they're going lift mask mandates. Indoor mask mandates one last things go, *will* go. trend toward governments lowering restrictions (often soon, anything) visible throughout pandemic. Chew me, automod.

We can't hide discussing politics involved pandemic response Reopen everything ditch masks. reason 70%+ now.

Well done, Connecticut! experience like today went pick take-out order restaurant last ordered two weeks prior. went in, social distancing stuff gone, servers longer wearing masks. like restaurant rewound back 2019. It’s simple lifting mask mandate months. quite possible happen want make less likely variant doesn’t emerge go back square one, gladly keep mask face months.

I hate short cited weak issue simple preventative measures need done months longer. took us year half “flatten curve” lmao I’d upset anyway  don’t think anyone knows that. vaccinations provide insane level protection regardless  I'm going say impossible, seems unlikely variant radically undermine vaccines have, especially mRNA vaccines. designed specifically around structure spike protein, virus significantly undermine vaccines, structure spike protein would change. Since spike protein makes covid contagious is, seems unlikely. Additionally, coronaviruses mutate slower pace something like flu. Also, data shows natural vaccination-induced immunity coronaviruses robust. example, people still immunity SARS 2003. Finally, US, booster shots fall most-worrisome variants cropped far.

All say think impossible novel variant would significantly evade immunity we've built far, seems unlikely estimation. He’s right CDC embarrassment. Hard believe incompetent were. Makes think departments rely on, like one controls nuclear response perhaps, might similarly incompetent true crisis arise.

Very interesting Bush sense put pandemic plan together. surprising based book read. Restaurant bars 100% since September. Phase 3 final phase reopening. linked relates ability local government establishing mask mandates. local mandates gone. Businesses still require masks. Tl;Dr stigma.  Protein deficiency causing blood clots way covid19 around. didn’t think anything headline article misleading. also think Florida’s choice wide open tourist destination makes prevalence variants national concern. Government Whitmer even said outbreak state could caused variant invasion FL due irresponsible tourists. found Carbone meat truck, frozen stiff took three days thaw autopsy anyone Connecticut confirm vaccine dangerous? Lots people missing?  never implied economics serve human lives, brought idea. 

The car thing pretty irrelevant still. Even people think improve car usage 99% population think gets car accepts risk. argument whether improve cities tangential that. vaccinated, go live life. There's nothing vaccine, done do. right, dont know downvoted. Even height pandemic anti-covid believers taking masks off. one hand, part feels like adjusting seeing things back normal soon difficult.

On hand least NOVA great spot spread vaccine rates despite plenty folks deciding restrictions ended already own. things continue improving top month, actually sounds fairly reasonable.... 49 sore arm shots day vaccination. Nothing else. Even 2 exponential growth gets billion cases 30 serial intervals. local town cookout Fairfield county CT probably around 200 people shoulder shoulder, maybe 10 masks total, even firefighters hosting damn thing.

They fuckin better vaccinated Israel high percentage people 16 population that's virtually everyone currently eligible. really can’t tell vaccinated people stop masking keep unvaccinated people masked. impossible enforce otherwise pain enforcement fall hard store restaurant employees isn’t fair. think really need keep mask mandates transmission low enough need anyone mask drop mandates everyone. Goodbye random moronic internet stranger declares people covid yet still demands testing fulfill political agenda! Somehow think, Africa quite well. Economy too. Can’t tell why. It’s feeling. Still lot opinion. Youngs rarely dying less rarely hospitalized. vaccines, may evaluate ruin healths without purpose? straight forward seperation two would implied.

I think may understanding I'm saying. Economics lives linked, economics serve humans. said, *must* serve humans, way around. place economy first, tail wagging dog--and moral consequences disastrous.

As cars thing, people frequently make comparison assume everyone must agree risks driving outweigh benefits. use argue accepting higher risks areas. point argument unsound, premise proven: *not* everyone agrees high level car usage way things be. one worst companies america work for. I'm really surprised huge class action lawsuit yet. one places effectively cant take legally required breaks. People what's best judge others. never know someone going through. 

I personally feel sad see people wearing masks situations feel like make sense... Like alone outdoors alone car -- going catch/spread covid scenarios. feel sad people feel afraid enough that.

I would never say something argue that's dumb. maybe wanted make sure feel afraid forced scenario? Idk, giving benefit doubt Goodbye angry internet stranger, go something fun :) It’s basically enforcement issue. disconnect what’s allowed actually happens. Intramuscular injections don’t need hurt. I’m medical professional given many intramuscular injections life haven’t heard complaints hurting.  medium term show us relative contagiousness B.1.617, currently know nothing. short term going take quite time simply catch existing lineages. Bangladesh something like [100 sequences per time one case indicates 1% prevalence (with high margin error). twice contagious B.1.351 (hopefully worst case) would still take month catch up. half (40% contagious) would two months. Even B.1.1.7 nearly 40% contagious B.1.351. process could rapidly accelerated introducing lot cases India, though. screaming year ago wanted tests. tests days you’re declaring internet stranger “obviously “ covid. it’s obvious hell fuss testing? Yeah

He seems trying really hard line officially declaring epidemic US 4th July symbolism, especially new announcement wants 70% country shots arms then. biggest issue communicate policy based science perceived response guideline changes. example, well known vaccinated could safely take mask outdoors; however, fear unvaccinated would swiftly communicate enough people vaccinated posed little threat either way. made announcement earlier based science left policy decisions states. 

Now majority vaccinated people wearing masks outdoors assumption significant chance spreading others vaccine ineffective passing within 6 feet others solely CDC recommendations say masks could ditched maintain social distancing. Like cardiovascular cells. Yeah, one seem like good system lose. old people largely vaccinated per article higher percentage younger people hospitalized. doesn’t point new problem younger people. shows young people need get vaccinated really end crisis. One mine hurt, painless. 

There's lot going shoulder muscles muscles.

You could get shot almost anywhere, shoulder convenient generally less painful. near lymph nodes.

Both needles size, generally smallest one make. Well Connecticut voted 60 40 Biden  lmao upset??? Oddly enough started working office around 12-15 people 3 years started getting sick like 2-3 times year. side effects proof working. Dude that’s never gonna happen  America’s Ass already declared covid. need test ??? That’s state! am.

Even places signs requesting people wear masks nobody really going say anything even staff frequently walking around chin diapers there's many unmasked people try enforcing push local federal representatives mandate masks vaccines. Get laws changed make legal administration orders (masks vaccines). Yelling people internet grocery line stores alienating humans squat actually solve problem. Yes awesome everyone getting vaccinated Mass restrictions continue August. fucking dumb  That’s true. cdc doesn’t make people anything. It’s state local governments.  virus survives longer cold surfaces. Warm weather better, think discovered, UV light destroys virus temperature. Elder abuse crime Someone salty eh? Chill lol restrictions dropped May That's pretty good record. Maybe immune system sheltered lol. Yes, agree. neglect safety citizens surpressed voices. reminiscent dictatorship democracy  said quite obviously covid. could side affects. I'm furious drew doodle face sharpie slept. mentioned comments factors without Laos recorded first COVID-19 death right now, effective use lockdowns population prone follow public guidelines probably main reason. really bad Vietnam. means havent catch spread yet. dont aggressively trace test now, we'll, well, turn next India. suspected cases, confirmed ones. going end infected full vaccination. another reply infection full vaccination confirmed though. Close it

They specified still recommend really dense crowds like outdoor concerts. guess, badly. hurt sure makes lot sense hadn’t thought that. dont N95s anything masks really easy put on/take heard pain sure. I’d probably keep driving super high risk andhad use N95 lot infected spring break leave state afterwards count towards Florida numbers. Joined second dose club today.

And forced lie people get take vaccine?

""A vaccine, perfect, effective way stopping community transmission. enough people get vaccinated, reach herd immunity drive cases low get back normal. cases still elevated herd immunity reached, practicing basic simple social distancing measures like wearing mask help us drive cases even faster help protect lives.""

That message effective enough? little hope human race can't handle even ounce nuance. used live CT 10 years ago. live Texas. Would crazy say wanna move back CT actually take virus seriously TX? Without immense pressure government may acted similar way. Impossible prove negative, however.  Vaccines essential way needs paired zero covid strategy.

We're putting position react emerging variants. places us offensive. react.

And US study enough react. sequence enough. Testing down. Almost one spillover testing. We're even truly tracking reinfections.

And messaging feels dishonest is. safe work restaurant safe drink alcohol restaurant. airborne is.

Our messaging designed get us participate economy based preventing infections.

So focus vaccines wealthy neighborhoods get vaccines poor neighbors accused vaccine hesitancy...

Thanks info. vax hogging infuriating (though seems unpopular take sub whatever reason), especially since seems like countries don’t even want use AZ shots 40 year old male here. 1st shot, side effects. 2nd shot, dick fell off. Don’t worry, found though.  exactly reasoning makes believe going tackle global climate change. family, personally, still taking precautions started taking year ago. It’s mostly mom immunocompromised, there’s evidence suggest even full vaccination, immunocompromised people little antibodies. here. get one pop clinics I'd rather avoid shitshow went booking appointment provincial site calculated? Making required certain things like travel, school, certain occupations would start. getting point vaccines available kids months, fully open restrictions regardless herd immunity let unvaccinated fend themselves. I'm waiting staff places drop masks. matter time, theater people going restaurants masks dropping 30s later 2 hours one enduring jokes whole thing. Let’s celebration ass parade Well CT outside mask restrictions last weeks, right? multiple states stated blindly follow cdc guidelines nuance 18 workers believe. pharmacists basically allowed take breaks... Never heard one before. Comedy king here. think would agree. don’t know shouldn’t wear mask indoors all. connecticunt got second shot yesterday! Thankful lived pandemic. don’t get all. things shouldve done pre-covid ? making moral argument. numbers fact countries bad outbreaks need higher levels vaccinations, since herd immunity vaccine immunity + natural immunity previous infections. People bashing Trudeau said anyone wants vaccine first dose end July, looking like reality Meningitis scary, thank god ended ok you’re right it’s needs mandatory That's pretty much restaurants around friday/saturday night 6 months. Unfortunately, people free vaxxed, thus preventing herd immunity. Government would force people vaccinated, could drive thing much sooner. Good luck. It’s science denial extreme risk aversion. got J&amp;J vaccine two days paused. tired achy one day, I’m otherwise fine! Swabs work collecting mucus cells inside nasal passages. PCR used amplify RNA present detectable levels. amount RNA frightfully low. think take seeing friends also get vaccine get sick almost die change mind. large check. needs mind business also don’t need wearing kf94 car (assuming aren’t others arent vaxxed) I’ve never said anything anybody wearing one car way top found something claim moral superiority over, they're mad taken away them. submission linking thedailybeast.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

I don’t see individual parent’s decision. society, choose keep minor inconvenience (masking indoors additional period) eliminate risk children choose convenience price putting risk them. feel obvious choice. people fighting rules year. husband got 2nd moderna shot May 1st, side effects 2 days stopped.

Well that's saying. one misinterpreting points. brought cars illustrate fact society infact wager economics safety said: two things never comparable never be. 

I brought cars show yes two things comparable, comparison done everyday. Even example strengthens argument basically saying current risk/benefit paradigm society worth relation cars- fact making comparison. always balance risk versus damage treatment does.

You're right.

Then fail apply :(

Using date 95% adults dose 1, get second dose 31 days later (1 month Moderna), plus additional 14 days immunity kick in, put us date of: Tuesday, August 3rd (- 31 days), 95% adults fully vaccinated.

Notes: 

* Pfizer EUA expanded age 12, eligible population updated approximately 6,101,782, estimated 12+ population using 2020 census (7,029,917 overall) (not 2019 estimate). FDA EUA 12-15 expected soon, probably sometime next week
* (- n days), difference predicted date compared predicted dates peak first doses back 4/14 couldn’t one argue common sense derived evidence basic knowledge real world?

Edit. definition Cambridge dictionary: basic level practical knowledge judgment need help us live reasonable safe way We’ll probably wearing masks 2022 even though we’ll like 90% vaccinated agree extent. layperson may confused, people r/Coronavirus sub likely already know scientific arguments. Nevertheless, think people respectful informative instead hostile votes long person kind too. Antimaskers reluctant maskers. getting first dose Pfizer tomorrow morning. Would ill advised lift weights immediately after? reading reports exercise reducing effectiveness, good, thought might ask anyways first hand experience. planned bench pressing. many people getting caught this. blow stupid things too. really worth it? think would get caught?

At least take money run non-extradition country. I'm ok. Life affected, move around normally, functions affected. new drug we're hoping stop progression actually helped fatigue some. lot people worse shape me. Yes, every community anti maskers who’ve irresponsible whole time. ban travel 25 mph perhaps cars altogether?

There always balance risk versus damage treatment does.

Not able travel miles home would disastrous effect economy. forced wear mask pretty much easiest thing world. people conflate vague 'sense normalcy' keeping mandates place treated giant fucking deal. aren't. correct name B.1.617. original lineages, A.1 B.1, also incorrectly called name Wuhan. Yeah that’s covid works amount would end hospital would negligible best. Probably unnoticeable / unable differentiate. I'm at. think I've seen like 3 people wear indoors whole pandemic. fair, I'm home lot might idiots see them. :P Please keep politics it. Community transmission still high many parts world. CVS makes insane amount money per employee surplus pharmacists. CVS could hire way people still make tons money. prime example late stage capitalism.  See comments! 773 name bar (and address). here’s thing: get chicken pox vaccine, brand new time older, didn’t realize needed second dose caught anyway. yeah, awful! think could even worse hadn’t one dose vaccine. friend’s dad hospitalized caught 20’s. Anyway, learned mistake got second COVID vaccine soon possible lol don’t know Americans problems masks are. really don’t. religious war people like stay health people don’t. Idiocy like everything days US. I'm waiting science definitive. still conducting studies prove conclusively vaccinated can't spread it. I'm listening CDC WH. Anyone know anything AZ doses USA? feel like last 2 weeks everyone sort ignoring maybe 60M doses lying around. feel like blue/educated area is, masks are? little pocket still religiously wearing masks even though one vaccinated region whole country. They’re expensive can’t write many scripts. It’s good system healthcare  I'm struggling grasp safe future safe now. anything, vaccine efficacy DECREASES time. choose reject multiple studies show vaccines work stop spread, willfully ignorant anti maskers.  course. governor got castigated certain segment population deferring CDC mask guidance state. seem convinced won’t lifted mind CDC would never lift “reasons”. expect mandate lifted sometime summer, data points case load cases per capita dropping point makes sense. 30 here. first moderna wasn’t bad. sore arm two days -the first day couldn’t lift next day sore, like flu shot- exactly week later red splotch arm little itchy. injection site deltoid. tripled size going away. coworkers also rash first dose, didn’t. assumed something ACE2 receptors keratinocytes there. 

I get second dose tomorrow idea I’ll react. I’m relieved thankful getting it. wish could make vaccines mandadory. Bust jackboots dole J&amp;J sleeping antivaxers.  loan, make pay back! Go Irish. Beat Corona. take larger cut vaccine cheaper? Yes, obeying Target point. Honestly, first Pfizer still really bad side effects 3 days. 70 something year old dad fine though! Everyone's body different kind crap shoot. moved north Jersey Philadelphia even though it’s river across, bullshit emanating Harrisburg rural center state spreads. still grocery shop NJ mask wearing rigorous. How? Waiting full approval. that's in, Pfizer able market heck it. Perhaps, FDA works. extremely conservative comes new medical treatments. pathologically prideful eventually wind going hospital, we'd see uptick. (given need keep healthcare systems running, hospitalizations respects important metric)  Getting J&amp;J shot also improves chances avoiding side effects, though completely. think people might fall camp fearing fever stretched thin worry missing work might find single dose option appealing.  lazy fearful needles day side effects. plenty people middle reach tipping point small incentives. 6 year old developed dermatitis, spending hundreds month dermatologist, may “harmless” it’s wrong assume it’s way everyone. Well, respecting policy businesses. 🍪 Thanks jerk. Adult chicken pox sounds miserable! one first groups chicken pox vaccine never everyone know got adults said absolute worse Burger place full maskless people tables talking eating

How one supposed eat mask on? Vaccine young children probably 4-6 months away.

I’m hoping improve toward 70% adults vaccinated get 12-15 year olds added pool we’ll see case volume decline low level, even without younger children vaccinated. wish people saw things way. People seem care personally got vaccinated want precautions gone. Yes, thankfully didn’t catch it. worried chicken pox honest, never it... guess what? got chicken pox first year dorm! I’m glad kids chicken pox vaccine now. am, see near perfect masking stores adults children 2. many been? might sort banana republic, we’re nowhere near military dictatorship.  Straight jail. Oklahoma checking 35% 

Sad quarantine noises... fully vaccinated people attend sporting event? 

For long? Forever?

I’m sorry, government mandates funny way going away best Mother's Day gift came yesterday. 3 young adults house two weeks past 2nd jab. Huge relief. wish something doggos cats.  think you’re wrong - don’t think surge identifiable given folks don’t want vaccine also aren’t getting tested regularly, therefore way identify cases. stay home go back work they’re feeling better. assholes go work sick. issue underlying condition fatigue constant companion. Yes, headaches scary really started scaring bad spleen hurting, often enlarged aware it. every joint body agony doctor certain mono. Yes, many states *can* first? Two? Three?  people threads today telling masks gone within months max everywhere. don’t want cautious know many places masks anymore aren’t getting vaccinated lore like 40-50% Texas full last night. Guess I’m whiny. There’s also data disproving many long term effects people thought connected covid beforehand like myocarditis link mild cases. 

Again, it’s choice fine support anyone’s individual risk assessment within reason. 

But people going weigh small chance child gets sick covid long term effects negative aspects kids normal lives decide risk worth like every time parent puts child car go somewhere, sends school flu season, lets play sport. really good book - would recommend anyone wants mad lol. Eh point restrictions gonna end...regardless vaccine percentages Snapchat say? /s Don’t know last 14 months behavior changes.

That's easy. ton people wearing masks mandates yank never wear minute mandates rescinded. get sentiment...but end day, cannot continue alter society like tiny portion population. get it, sounds like I’m asshole, pragmatically it’s truth. 

Immunocompromised people going get shafted. That’s truth things. said we're careful easing mask mandates right time, there's probably going yet another surge (primarily unvaccinated people) everyone returns normal(er) social lives. checked doctor? please wash fruits/vegetables soap water clorox wipes. Disinfectant made consumption I’m saying I’ve seen people it. Cases low state hotspots near us. took baby trampoline park yesterday. went right opened everything sanitized birthday party attended. much fun actually taking somewhere could enjoy ourselves.  especially like mask, look flu statistics last year....I believe I'll serously consider it! vaccine gives stronger side effects? many weeks second dose? Maybe ironic right word. Maybe amusing. People get tested regularly number reasons w/o symptoms you’re CT, Vernon walk in, appointment, choose shot clinic happening. friend mine administers shots says aren’t even close using allotted supply! Hah! patient like beginning pandemic! keep head checkin, concerned him! 

Did neck feel stiff, too? epic headache fever classic symptoms. doubt US ever get 80%. politicized. someone addition problems before, knows people heavy drinkers - we/they less responsive vaccines? (Pfizer moderna) 

I mean got mine already, go soon encouraged lol 

I tried reading suspect there’s enough information know. read neither company makes mRNA vaccines mentioned things ... Last Friday pharmacy buying beverages thought ask could schedule 2nd dose (their website allowed scheduling first second.) figured hurt. surprise, let get spot. guy 20s, never imagined day vaccines widely available state. could help rest world well Nonzero chance you’d buy point. Thanks! BS headline BS editing.
If first, second, third, fucking sure one first.
 
plus gem entire body text: 
 one first states country hit huge milestone vaccination efforts.
Gov. Ned Lamont says state administered least one dose coronavirus vaccine 70% adults.
President Joe Biden set July 4th **ass** nation’s goal hit 70% mark.
 
Yeah. Fire copy editor along internet team. Nobodys watching video. see replies, correct.

If restrictions lifted, immunocompromised people going completely screwed. one seems plan that, even single thought it. Colds still make dent productivity could recovered mask wearing. someone obese really feel this.

It's vicious circle I'm struggling get of. worse feel worse eat. Literally fear catching covid fat already made comfort eat.

It's simple eat less psychological factors behind people fat. I'd love see food fuel and.nothing else. sympathy isn’t much (maybe little, may victim disinformation, also feel bad kids). sympathy people can’t get vaccinated health reasons (cancer chemo patients), kids, immunocompromised people don’t benefit much vaccines. 

Also spreads, greater risk mutations evade vaccines deadly.  Depends Texas suspect. friends whose kids back school F2F since last fall... issues either. definitely different much social distancing, one way hallways can't socialize freely lunch still sounds better crapfest virtual stuff we've suffered Michigan. Yeah really sorry. Consider getting test done days. I'm wrapping 2000 mile motorcycle roadtrip around western U.S right now. want go place nobody gives fuck masks may suggest Prescott, Arizona Southern Utah. Make sure people don’t information time use information make decision? real supporter democracy are. Nope, wouldn’t anything Good them. I’m ashamed. Arkansas sucks. wonder covid ever go away then...wouldnt new mutations every winter/summer around world.......... hear truth. Cuomo made sure heard *after* election. important part. Pfizer shown less side effects. don’t know reasoning, perhaps that’s why? Inb4 year 2137... New respiratory virus emerges.. ppl wear bionic respirators.. ppl point effective slow transmission covid-19 back 2020 even though fiber masks... Ppl proceed wear bionic respirators anyway yolo. perfect world keep wearing masks extremely low burden vaccines 100% effective.

Good thing world perfect, there's chance hell I'm wearing mask mandates lifted. get fully vaccinated follow restrictions rest life Covid? Yes. colds, that’s possible yet. I’m sorry. must stressful! don’t mind asking, located? We’ve lucky daycare far adults vaccinated, we’re going get surge people careless feel way, wish CDC change message. I’m sorry, name replies, guess you’re troll account 😂 so, good job!

The best thing could’ve done end policy earlier apologize mistake. Admit bad move. refuse accept lies government okay behavior, whichever political party come from. nursing homes nothing masking.

Whether truth comes NY AG Trump’s AG, public right hear holds leaders accountable causing covering deaths. get it, refuse sell them? Well shit. policy makers can’t see mile away baffles me. course scared everyone. Idiots! 

I Pfizer shots already, moment pause happened entire Covid vaccination room lost damn mind. sudden everyone complaining every ache pain blaming shot. 🙄 publicly pausing 6 blood clot cases WORST decision ever. suffer hearing loss depend lot lip facial reading. Masks suck. still wear mine though respect others too. matter businesses want. drive away customers, they'll cease exist. think backlash going swing way. example, quit buying clothes local store infuriatingly refuses open fitting room. may well order online return stuff fit. also refuse patronize restaurants takeout drive thru only. want eat home, I'll cook home. Doubt it. countries comparing similar population sizes? keep couple hundred thousand people dying every year that's apparently pace guys okay going back normal with. yet... wants kids summer camp times wear masks even outside? FFS one's pointed obvious yet: business going keep paying people check vaccine cards whatever pandemic over. There's every reason think covid vaccines join others: required school, international travel, special situations. It’s close 100% preventing serious illness. It’s 90-95 % effective preventing Covid, period. extremely well protected Covid. It’s difficult get much protected virus this. Anyone story that’s behind paywall? tired day

Same. But, second shot Saturday, awake day. could naturally tired, could second dose aftereffects. knows? never said wasn’t? Pandering pandering pandering.  pissed off...i gfs zero wrong ate much cake younger got vaccine MONTHS ughhhh... Rite Aids today woman coughing vigorously behind me. I’m getting vaccine tomorrow (scheduled last week already. Would stop becoming sick event end becoming infected today? Pharmacist desperately need union. highest burnout rates nation declining pay compared degree costs. Great job spreading misinformation. Keep up. That's good thing. Dangle carrot. Tell people drop mask mandates people vaccinated.

This good pandering. Fosun rights vaccine invested BioNTech's vaccine plan March 2020. soon indoor mask mandate lifted state, burning masks. We’re killing CT!! included! vaccines accessible easy get here. second shot scheduled EXACTLY 3 weeks later -automatically. brainer get done! Way go CT! One way think chances getting seriously ill covid vaccination even less getting seriously ill flu. means mostly normal life including going things went before. can't recieve vaccines, there's increasing evidence WORK I’m totally you, hang point want vaccine, get it.

So anybody vaccinated blame (immunocompromised health issues aside). Exaggeration yes. done yet. We'll getting booster shots fall....for new variants.... Thanks comment! click daily US vaccine threads every day see comment! Hurting others No, that’s choice. Yep. Know guy took 6 mil PPP, never actually shut production company. Told workers essential stayed open whole pandemic, pocketed cash. He’s worth 50 million. Funny thing is, would one sitting telling everyone “welfare queens” everyone wants “live government.” projection always strong types. Hope shit catches him. Yeah, see Florida dropping cases every day three weeks straight either. Well wear indoors rules say so, respect them. Outdoors, care less rando walk street thinks tbh. make appointment dentist don’t show up. Believe not. Jail.

We best patients world. opinion person feel ashamed living unhealthy lifestyle? Dogs *can* get infected according CDC World Organization Animal Health CDC links paragraph below. likely catch dog small number pets worldwide, including cats dogs, infected virus causes COVID-19, mostly close contact people information available date, risk animals spreading COVID-19 people considered low. Might live. live area Massachusetts inwhich everyone pretty much follows mandates without making fuss. also great population getting shots. Maybe feel little comfortable idea going out. variants popping daily.

That true. would consider small things adds up.
- lot work camera constant mask on/mask off/mask on/mask really frustrating, plus ruins make up.
- go outdoor gym still can’t go without mask. Spin class high intensity mask really difficult, everyone wearing mouths anyway part it’s just... security theater.
- wearing long flights travel days, trying sleep plane hard enough
- makes must harder understand people, especially accents language barriers.

I’m them, I’m going cause scene anything, can’t wait hopefully done good. Aid India focused sending Vaccines incentivizing vaccination. Nothing else stop spread.  follow science wear outdoors. people want keep virtual signaling, fine. really care.  one except folks care mild discomfort children yet offered opportunity receive vaccine. Well fit N95s young children exist keep 5 year old home grocery store, etc asshat can’t bear wear mask 30 minutes shop could infect her. find 5 10 years damn virus causes significant organ damage, cancer (several cancers known associated viral infection) I’m gonna feel really sad kids parents took view infection virus benign kids acted accordingly. wear mask another 6-12 months allow every person country OPPORTUNITY receive vaccination, especially kids. hard people. vaccinated? not, not? question magazine/news site whatever read. headlines. things gotta watch for. every headline twists around Fauci's words, find others report actual facts what's going on. last heard Fauci say there's good chance may start loosen indoor mask mandate fairly soon get vaccinated. FOX News suggest staying away from. full lies. disingenuous say easy. annoying, especially glasses hot. No, social signaling people can't trusted Samesies I’m fully vaccinated living Miami. Would bad idea start going gym? wait people vaccinated? I’m bit confused 94% effectiveness means keep reading different things, gathered isn’t 94% effective preventing sickness, preventing *serious* sickness correct? 36 hour journey... (16 hour flight + 5 hour flight + 1 hour island hopper layovers) got realllll tiring end. Same. wrong.

You're darn right.

After previous year going feel strange.

I miss it. really do. ..but way large swaths population treated masks etc like second coming creator Godwin's Law, trust public much did.. idea Mediterranean genes. unrelated season... would smarter say 70%, best we're going get Northram. He's great this. US mandatory unlimited sick leave issue. Especially since many people used sick days extra PTO. service offered drive thru? Nice see first doses staying pretty close flat time tried every fabric, get bad reactions outdoors specially hot humid weather, indoor mask wearing AC doesn’t affect us, it’s roller coaster pull school skin getting really bad wearing mask running recess PE. think date, everyone wants one gotten opportunity get one. Everyone else go take chances. much harder someone change life feel isolated unsupported. 70% American adults overweight, people likely family friends. Life rough enough. provide support easily prick. initial messaging, accurate time studies looked symptomatic cases. Going real-world data, appear vaccines also significantly cut spread. Sure, may inadvertently spread someone at-risk, always case. Masks probably still good idea right now, base rules possibilities data we'd masks forever. Hunker what?

I'm 18 fully vaccinated. Realistically I'm way likely die car accident die covid. infect grandma? vaccinated too. Yeah same. Fully vaxxed now, I'm gonna get real sick masking hours flying. can’t provide specific examples here, I’m white man, there’s shockingly deep history American medical community exploiting undeserving communities color. Nonconsentual medical studies performed black people recently mid 20th century. Additionally, medical pharmacological research US historically focused outcomes white people black people sometimes worse outcomes exact treatment. Doctors researchers become aware changes happening, distrust still lingers especially older black Americans. also true research fields outside medicine.

(My friend performs agricultural research it’s far harder get black owned farms agree participate research. finds quite disappointing wants benefit research well.) sitting front woman plane yesterday clearly distraught hearing aides died since everyone wearing mask, figure anyone saying (I guess could read lips?). voicing concern woman sitting next her, could hear response kind ironic, seatmate said ""yeah well *everyone* part know"". think used mindset affect anyone wear mask, it? think experience world around me, realize many many people negatively affected inability read facial expressions caused around wearing mask. hearing issues, children still mastered language yet need visual cues, speaking second language need visual clues understand lanuguage quite fully grasped yet. think really important consider negative impacts thinking public policy rather assuming measure purely beneficial  boyfriend Glenn Greenwald says Bolsonaro enthusiastic participant [military mom asked wear mask order, waitress said care, I'm vaxxed. Looked like owner came around ask people doing, totally unmasked. Nobody cared, mask mandate state (not one crazy NE states though) Yeah, wear mask too. everyone wants vaccine gotten one, I’d like ditch mask. Especially since gym allows 16+ even enter. literally said thing got downvoted oblivion. 

We’re woods yet next surge gonna unvaccinated people, we’re gonna vaccinated people getting sick (statistically bound happen) antivaxxers going use excuse continue get vaccinated. It’s vicious cycle. Nope, I’m saying it’s reason people shouldn’t wear masks (literally said that). However, OP says unnecessary mask wearing harms one, MIGHT completely accurate, least psychologically level. obeying target wear shoes shirt store, too, m8. Kids schools. Stop faux outrage. already posted Reposts removed.  MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) got scientific name region primarily affected, hindsight scientists agreed bad thing, stopped that.

News outlets hand follow scientific naming Covid kill faster it’s present danger. Read said, read said. 

Don't put words mouth. healthy unvaccinated person safer Covid overweight vaccinated person. would think that? Pretty much this. Businesses cater people, without customers, businesses die. 

Was TX work stores restaurants required masks losing business ones didnt. time left 3 weeks later, many businesses required before, took signs down, changed signs read 'masks recommended.' course larger corporations like costco target might keep awhile longer, even stopped enforcing part. year getting pummeled economically, doubt businesses either eventually drop masks, risk losing out. Shame doesn’t help anyone change. Word. 

The CDC first foremost political institution, scientific one. know science, they’re perfectly willing lie think telling truth lead bad outcomes somehow - leads saying “masks don’t work”, making “fully vaccinated” point two weeks second dose vaccines (despite Pfizer evaluated trials one week second dose - zero scientific reason two weeks), acknowledging virus airborne fucking week. course look staff.

That would terrible profits. Lol verifiably wrong, 94% means. Here's quote article. 95% actually means vaccinated people 95% lower risk getting COVID-19 compared control group participants, vaccinated. words, vaccinated people Pfizer clinical trial 20 times less likely control group get COVID-19. ""*  Walking might struggle breathing issues. can't.

Why not? should. What's carrot now? people, **no** antibodies. point “it’s protect themselves” literally family doing. Paywall I’m saying someone lives country less 1% population vaccinated. US still bad spot needs get things control. Im going wearing anyways, solidarity people lost, cant access vaccine yet, also example people may gotten vaccine yet dont want to. risk covid vaccination probably lower flu without vaccination. caveat there's never much flu going around once. people like guy took money away people genuinely needed it. PPP ran real fast last year left many real businesses trouble. Crime problem. What’s point getting vaccinated aren’t going act differently?

One goal vaccination make cases go away entirely. Since cases still high, makes sense take extra precautions help lower society wide. whole entirely right vaccination back almost normal. going take time sink dad. Probably week next. Maybe full FDA (non-emergency) approval Aug-Sept. semi-educated guesses. cares rest world huh? point comment? bullshit paper said 75% Manaus already virus second massive wave. Gee ....didn't need one year.. .gosh wonder could protected me?? Completely random. headache sounds like caused dehydration. Take electrolytes.  live New Orleans glasses... pretty easy lol. Still looking forward wearing course. found Carbone meat truck, frozen stiff took three days thaw autopsy  office's town listed reasons delaying lifting outdoor mask mandates as:

1) CDC explicit say safe walk past people outside vaccinated 2) ""some people ready see people's faces without masks"" want calls despite public health committee almost unanimously voting measure

I think social norms dictating policy instead science. eliminate masks outside reasonable time faith eliminating masks mandates together double-infections, infections vaccination. number basically exactly would expect 80-95% protection reinfection 90 day tests requirement. 

CDPHE said positive tests among vaccinated 90-95% lower unvaccinated, still assuming zero mortality risk vaccination. hope people required mask, i.e., daycare staff. kid's daycare closed temporarily staff member close contact kids multiple classrooms. Sure, EUA vaccine kids 12-15 could come soon week, kids 12 remain unprotected vaccines get EUA. babies 6 months, vaccine may likely.   start wearing masks mess you. nothing vaccine

Mutations exist..? Including vaccine-resistant ones..? actually impression getting vaccine means pandemic you?

By means, explain mutations possible sources backing shit I'll gladly change view. Seeing viruses mutate, must ground breaking science proving otherwise.

Bring knuckle dragging, ignorant, armchair scientists downvote without actually proving wrong.  year, recognition extraordinary historic inequalities etched Brazil, federal government released vaccination plan prioritized people called situations “elevated social vulnerability.” Indigenous people, quilombo residents, homeless incarcerated: reversal everyday social hierarchy, would join health-care workers elderly front vaccination line. struggles underscored Brazil’s broader failure secure enough vaccines control disease killed 421,000 people, largest toll outside United States. 1970s, amid military dictatorship’s frenetic quest develop vast country, new highway cleaved territory two, bringing unregulated real estate speculation land grabbing.

Case rates drop us won’t run infected person normal day.

Colorado’s numbers look right line: ~90% reduction cases vaccinated people, we’re averaging ~74 vaccinated people testing positive COVID week (with many precautions still place), it’s probably time ease masks quite yet background rate drops further. I’m saying dropping restrictions goal zero COVID, there’s time place it, personal opinion hit 1 1000 case rates, Colorado’s quite 1 400 right now. I’d figure we’ll hit rate sometime near first second week June may wait another week dropping indoor mask requirements reasonable approximation Fauci’s original guess July 4th. No, we’re 37.9% fully vaccinated. We’re one worst states fully vaccinated. Depends mean, ""mask outdoors"". crowded public area anywhere w people wearing mask, outdoors w one around fine not.

You know still get covid wearing mask right? them. There's huge Biontech plant Marburg (Germany), huge Pfizer plant Puurs (Belgium), guess Pfizer production capacities US, too. course suppliers around world.

I believe Fosun (Biontech's Chinese partner company) currently setting production China, too. June end probably UK residents get one. Aug end doses.

Like this? mean something else? state 47.3% 16 years older fully vaccinated...I'm counting state getting 70% reasons... nasty germs literally stop functioning well. 3 problems idea. 

1. vaccines provide perfect immunity. Seychelles 35% cases new outbreak fully vaccinated people. open getting herd immunity outbreak people responsible got vaccinated still get sick. 

2. NZ hospital system already stretched capacity normal conditions. outbreaks among unvaccinated populace quickly overwhelm hospitals impact everyone. 

3. many people cannot vaccinated get full protection vaccine pre-existing conditions. rely herd immunity. hard govt justify opening borders without herd immunity would put burden people. families would media. people don’t trust vaccines, put trust masks fascinate me. 

Masks important tool fighting pandemic, one thing clearly much effective people don’t seem realize that. Current mutations affect less 1% spike's genetic code. plenty scope mutations. Hong Kong still banning gatherings 4 people. There's byzantine rules many people sit table restaurant, depending vaccinated using contact tracing apps.

Australia still enforcing occupation limits indoors, Sydney stricter rules like banning drinking alcohol standing dancing public.

NZ probably open activities allowed, mandatory masks transport. Done wearing them, suck hard Perhaps drop right map. response perfect. agree blocking borders implementing mandatory quarantine right way we've locked citizens country disgusting ashamed. majority living going concerts nightclubs minority fearing lives foreign country might even allowed in. disgusting. wife struggled 10 days, second shot Moderna vaccine. would good information shared medical team vaccine.

Australians aren’t allowed leave country citizens coming back it’s complicated. unaware what’s happening there. Look up, it’s intriguing. Many citizens stranded abroad year now. vaccinated doesn’t make different all, anytime soon. 🙌🙌🙌  guess assumed airborne cause thought that’s droplets were? Eh. 99%+ chance totally fine predictable actually. Tons young adults haven’t given shit since pandemic started. wear mask anyway. Ur welcome. borders probably. longer 3 months! Well Gottleib saying saw two doctors CNN say thing. Fauci said time start thinking Week.   swab test 2 days ago maybe 1 hour taking swab test noticed streaks blood mucus try spit out. tried observe today still blood. chronic sinusitis, possible swab test caused infection? I'm 20s UK I'm looking getting first dose July :(

And second dose around October 

We're even going slowly, nearly every single person wants vaccine. Nope. Fuck that. We’re done. Wear mask want. second try force others who’ve vaccinated case numbers low are... fuck right off.  even really exaggeration. plan deliver 70 million doses Q2. end Q2 still need deliver 200 million doses existing contract. Assuming keep 70 million doses per quarter finish contract somewhere Q1 2022. Sure one assume speed deliveries hand EU countries plan everybody vaccinated latest September. vaccine availability already issue anymore that. lot existing AZ contract delivered longer needed EU. order more? blame you. protected. unlikely transmit. courtesy others point may vaccinated still actually worry catching it, keep others give care people check compliance. They're probably half-assing too, least mask offering protection none all. Seems like vaccine resisintat then. hope. Well guess doesn’t matter don’t live western countries. First beat old East Asians, suppose anyone looks brown next. company willing give domestic production UK go. they'd partnered company based somewhere subsequently decided implement export controls (e.g. US), there'd thousands dead UK right now. Aus originally went AZ ordered 5million doses Pfizer (For health care workers, border staff old age care).

Since blood clot issue became apparent ATAGI (EMA equivalent Aus) restricted AZ 50's .

Since Aus produces AZ locally (now 1million doses week) actually surplus AZ 4million doses produced ~2.2 million administered, decision made open AZ appointments 50's wanted selective appointments 50 start new larger Pfizer order started arrive. increase physical isolation social isolation among respondents COVID-19 social distancing policies. However, respondents experienced change digital isolation loneliness. increase physical isolation present people high COVID-19 concern whereas people low concern experienced change physical isolation. suspect natural immunity much higher many people think. college student, know many peers get tested inferred caught covid, even including asymptomatic. Even likely overlap, probably won’t need full 70% vaccinated reach herd immunity, considering natural immunity robust vaccine stop reinfections. Case numbers lower they’ve since beginning pandemic, we’re zero risk new wave overwhelming healthcare systems. point enough enough? first symptoms started showing 16 hours shot (second dose)

but varies everyone parts country, supply vaccines exceeded demand. couple weeks, everyone wants vaccine given opportunity get one, REALLY need get away caring who’s vaccinated who’s move towards “take care shit. Wear mask want don’t. It’s health.” Luck practice. lucky low amount cases early on, could quarantine international arrivals. large wave one state solved expensive (17 week) lockdown. states bit scared let short lock downs (about 3 days) one case. federal government also gave income support many people work. stand want take respect that, please respectful someone else continues bit longer. chronic illness fought tooth nail get health back past 5 years. I'll unmasking fall earliest, maybe winter. continue mask stores. keep mask much cold mask. agree. Completely pro-mask. hot really don’t like it. everyone ACCESS vaccine, whether avail not, I’m done it. won’t protect via vaccine, accepted risk virus. wish they’d vaccinate? YES. make choice. vaccine free, widely available, easy access. county 75% adults (16+) vaccinated first dose. Almost there. hope enough vaccinated protect can’t, won’t, get vaccine. I’m ready return normal, live music, gatherings, restaurants bars... Duh. Brazil's struggling vaccinate pretty much population general. dad's bit 60, got 1st shot days ago. I'm 42, knows I'll get jab. ;-( Yep, walked family local restaurant yesterday eliminated restrictions, immediately turned around walked went another restaurant. normally spend around $80-90 meal place, won’t go back. country gave nuance subtlety long time ago. like every single issue. What’s latest status vaccines available kids 12+ US? 

I thought FDA approval supposed happen last week…. Washington Post number, that’s total shots given, I’m sure out-of-state individuals. state us little 4.4 million, approximately 64% (using 6.9 million number) approximately 61% (using 7.17 number). state says 4.7 million 70% threshold, calculation, total adult eligibility 6.7 million we’re currently 66%. Israel run massive supply snafu Pfizer refusing give more? wrong metric. Every legitimate source CT 57% (which close best country). Unsure math behind 70%. key word register. can't actually give date get vaccinated yet believe. No. fucking isn't, incredibly telling traumatic year everyone, especially youngest done everything could, got shots second could I’m just... done.

Same here. 13 months never leaving house except go grocery shopping hiking woods (and religiously wearing mask did), fully vaccinated month now, continued moderately cautious getting vaccinated give everyone else chance get theirs. anyone wants vaccine get one day without appointment, I'm done. Pfizer reported sign decline 6 months, youre actually probably wrong last part

""However, get second dose vaccine, you’re training immune system,” said Boslett. You’re strengthening response antibody-producing B cells you’re also activating memory cells stick around much longer.” Getting doses vaccine means body shown spike protein multiple times short duration. “So immune response might bigger, better longer lasting getting infection one time,” said.""

from last year day coming. applications process anti-vaxxers lose disingenuous excuse. wouldn’t. 

I keep seeing thing people like “just say don’t wear mask socially distance anymore get vaccinated” cause people go get it. Maybe people would, let’s honest reaching point want could gotten point getting soon anyway. don’t want tend never really cared Covid/mask wearing first place. 

All that’s going basically make everything return normal spot. outdoor masking restriction changed, one read “fully vaccinated” read “no masks outside” stopped there. fair, never knew rule outside large groups around people. people read “no masks”. going enforce that? Vaccine passports? already know people faking shit. 

Those don’t want it, don’t care, probably never never will.

So goal return normal, yeah say that, it’s get people vaccinated, don’t see work. extraordinarily rare brave throughout all. Well done. Wearing mask traumatic . evidence vaccine might prevent infection reduce symptom severity given immediately exposure. Note Covid research, diseases. Basically, post-exposure vaccination ""race"" virus vaccine. diseases long incubation periods, like rabies, vaccine effective. Covid average incubation period 8 days according recent research know trial volunteers saw evidence efficacy 11 days take incubation period account protection earlier that. good chance reducing symptoms severity, probably infection prevention. im honestly curious different things would pilgrims forced wear masks since know outdoor transmission extremely unlikely, especially masks on. soon fully vaccinated. Maybe year so.

You *probably* many antibodies vaccination would take really huge exposure enough virus get make far past antibody immunity. Blows away sitting millions vaccines. agree, weeks. However states open weeks already masks distancing vaccine wasn’t even available adults wanted it. Hell made first shot available adults weeks ago, even adults (like myself) really jumped opportunity went day available them, still haven’t second shot (mine scheduled Wednesday). Pfizer. Sore arm, could barely lift straight way head. Absolutely side effects though. that’d great idea kids also permitted vaccinated. Unfortunately won’t  It’s pretty unlikely side effects hit quickly. Also, people claim “my allergies went away masks.” don’t think that’s seasonal allergies work. I’m pretty sure allergens pretty easily penetrate get cloth/medical mask, also get home much open window. thats part it, runs deeper that. apparently theyve similar panics side effects past, japanese government also stopped making vaccines mandatory would legally responsible side effects didnt want deal Get get hug, pint, shag Well states lockdown india including mine. one petty thing learned pandemic much hate menus phone. even dinned anywhere, ordering takeout, like paper menus much more. depends case. times, vaccine prevent feeling symptoms young healthy. cases outbreaks vaccinated nursing homes, vaccinated elderly patients (who otherwise would've severe cases) instead asymptomatic light flu-like symptoms. course sadly rare instances vaccinated people getting severe cases Covid. plenty people think rightly wrongly COVID nuiscance go ways vaccine think they'll things. thanks. probably go this, though phrase wear ""if anyone unvaccinated would like wear it,"" rather making assert they're emotionally uncomfortable something i'm doing. 

it going bit strange regardless. there's pushback CDC relaxing guidelines vaccinated people (like sister saying vaccinated people wear masks outdoors recently) get purely emotional level, since living way long behaviors feel safe, regardless they're actually safe.  literally used words ok lol. Maybe read lines understand didn’t mean people take words face value. someone expert makes quote media hot topic choose words carefully. far understood media, large plants mostly packaging individual vials, actual vaccines created large quantities small labs, plant Marburg gets actual vaccine delivered bulk BioNTech headquarters Mainz.

I assume vaccine packaged Fosun plant come BioNTech lab Singapore. doubt BionTech hand production actual vaccine Chinese companies, would go everything Merkel telling ihrer Wortmeldung sagte Merkel Freitag, dass es niemand wollen könne, wenn China die moderne, im Westen von Biontech und Moderna entwickelte mRNA-Technik think better go proper safety testing first approving vaccine youngsters. would pretty bad vaccine hesitancy got child-specific risk popping couple months vaccination age group, caught expedited testing. 

The regulatory agencies know doing. let job; vaccination younger age groups come soon enough. Meanwhile, adult gets vaccine one fewer person liable pass child can't vaccinated yet! poorly ventilated space. interesting translated word “Olympics” picture, translate back English becomes “five rings” honestly, what? Statistically, doesn’t much them, rest population already vaccinated what’s big issue? I’d love see science concerns look at, say Israel, seems issue whatsoever. I’ve vaccinated month, longer wear mask indoors, zero issues. people don’t want mask makes idiots? Maybe worry yourself. Canada’s vaccine rollout embarrassing Wait, whole time conservatives liberal liberals conservative? Kids summer camp age can't even get vaccinated point. Source: oversee summer camps read guidelines daily basis  love Olympics much, try win vaccinating? I’ve seeing people come without mask.

Around strictly enforce ""you must wear mask wait line outside enter restaurant"" rule. instant sit table everyone takes mask leaves entire time there. put leave, walk 20 feet table door. could design ""not based sort science"" policy tried. fan experts general Dr. Wen generally sensible one. think fear mongering, saying may resurgence enough people get vaxxed. take stats class sometime  say thinks start again. talking possibilities. Scientists would foolish deny real possibilities escape variants emerging large levels spread/mutation opportunities still emerging. RNA vaccines likely hold strong time idea long. AZ already drastically reduced effectiveness SA variant example. legit concerns deny layfolk can't handle contemplating possibilities, even unlikely, would insanely foolish.

This fear mongering. science. can't handle discerning two stick profession vaccinated yet? maybe read article assume talking world lol whole family vaccinated, except 16-month-old son right pandemic hit. struggled infertility years him. stuck inside get vaccinated one slight health issue doctors concerned Covid. whenever want go anywhere, see mom inlaws watch him, nightmare 2 people pick since friends nearby get vaccinated. can't wait take places, seems like wait next year turns 2. mental health taken dive bring another child world.

Unfortunately area barely cracked 30% vaccinated, transmission rates high and, pediatrician told seeing tons kids come covid wait bit longer venture out. almost put money Biden making big announcement Friday going 4th July weekend stop social distancing masking public fully vaccinated

Still hoping happens Friday going Memorial Day weekend instead. current rate vaccine decline, 5 weeks difference two dates likely going get us additional 1% vaccinated. many currently vaccinated start getting booster shots Sept / Oct, hopefully keep Fall increases minimum. lockdown allowed ive always wanted do: absolutely nothing Even people ""believe"" science hate masks. wear alternative COVID widespread control worse. know single person actually *enjoys* wearing masks. ask brand new card filled out. 10 covid variant cases since March. one day.

Apparently, may anecdotal (I found one thing quick Japan HPV search), increase serious side-effects HPV vaccine released. caused lot skepticism around safety vaccines lot Japanese citizens, according her.

Once adults vaccinated daily vaccination results slowed trickle one else wants vaccine, right answer drop restrictions everyone let vax-refusers bear burden risk. adult vaccination rate likely prior infection rate, healthcare system safe, goal along. We're maybe 2-3 weeks away point now. article basically covered bases: short, japanese people hesitant get vaccinated, even japan logistical issues, theres many japanese people rushing get vaccinated right Unfortunately, self-centred asshole anti-vaxxers sufficient enough COVID keep spreading mutating.

Those fuckers going get vaccinated people killed. yet tolerate bullshit. That's weird! sounds like vaccine definitely cured strange thing lingering. One colleagues tested positive .

So office asked us go seven day quarantine return office (provided get negative test)

However googled ,it recommended 14 days quarantine mandatory.

Anyone know logic 7 day quarantine . even bigger companies (where friends work) also asking 7 day quarantine returning work get pharmacy webpages? It’s sign up. Need find pharmacies offering vaccine site filter moderna/Pfizer (since eligible AZ), go pharmacy webpage. pharmacy page click “No” special criteria “Yes” “I hour get call” button... way extra cancellation get list. Curious. Israel waiting US FDA approval? usually base medical choice FDA? they're already plummeting good thing y’all done lol. remember everyone saying Canada one best. It’s shame didn’t put bigger emphasis getting vaccines. hope y’all get enough soon  socialize? Avail number free video chat/conferencing services available. Want socialize without anyone watching like NSA? Use Signal also offers video chatting. Realtime face face socialization without need physically room.

A poor substitute actual socialisation well adjusted individuals. Yet sold us doses promising deliver time. COVID never going away. Ever. Likewise, policy needs evolve match seasonal flu pneumonia like issue vaccinations recommended people, including high risk people, assess whether want shot not. wearing mask right protection, wearing properly. know apply wear mine properly.  Half “life hold” people complaining prob don’t go anyway. Laughably entire company forever

The pandemic still going. far concerns AZ, over. non-delivered production capacity cost refocus business overprized cancer drugs big aquisition. SARS-CoV-2 gets body you’re fully vaccinated, able feel anything immune system reacts?

You’re pathetic. school ffs. Also don’t give shit socializing since started. Source fiancé teacher. Stop clutching pearls agree Indian statistics highly undercounting cases deaths real number deaths [close 3x](http://www.healthdata.org/special-analysis/estimation-excess-mortality-due-covid-19-and-scalars-reported-covid-19-deaths) official numbers nowhere close 10 million. I'm going need look wow. idea mandatory vaccines. Good know travel. Yeah understand. I’m suffering Covid fatigue. live part country people don’t give shit masks vaccines I’ve done much could year mostly every one around nothing. It’s frustrating Sunk Cost Fallacy. looking ventilation rates people return indoors, feel like almost completely overlooked. know Germany says June/July much doubt 99%+ population hesitant take vaccine. Odd...I thought govt forcing masks people year liberal policy.. Florida’s spreaders tourists. 

They go Florida, spread covid go home. 

So Florida’s numbers aren’t going lack restrictions unquestionably causing covid cases rise. 

If anything numbers this. think anyone problem someone choosing continue wearing mask. problem people advocate mandates based scientific fact. Cool Reading article, weird way perception starting reopen. Schools open since start March, shops, hairdressers etc 4 weeks iirc. Foreign travel aside, control point, there's pubs restaurants opening indoors feel normal again. I’ve definitely wondered next year look like. 

Considering violently opposed rural areas acknowledging pandemic, doubt majority would even consider getting COVID test/going see health professional get sick. means we’ll likely never good understanding outbreaks actually happen. kinda care kid suffers Long Covid. submission linking google.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Even country 100% vaccinated, would want turning international hub pandemic. pandemic still close over, plenty countries really struggling, big spreading even point increases chances vaccine resistant strain popping up. Victim. Putting life hold essentially two years straight really, really, chafed skin. never taken vacation work life l week stress grief, know would happened me. I'm definitely COVID. actually help lot seasonal allergies Yeah think high school start totally normal fall? I’m going senior covid began halfway thru sophomore year really need normal last year. Also vaccine eligible whole school population, start without masks someone’s fault don’t get shot? Blaming citizens problems government foreign country. Gee, wonder from. Ireland controversy hospitals charge administering (scarce) vaccines stealing doses families, friends business better vaccinating people thankfully though, nearly 2 million doses Man stupid. would love see study showing someone get covid someone else airport runway LOL. That's really surprising. Considering efforts Japan took early on, assumed would also good vaccination plan. certain point benefits safety measures outweighed costs. saying we’re aiming 0 risk smart public policy process, least Spain, follows:
- EU buys vaccines distributes them.

- Spain, distributed among different regions.

- within appropriate age range, receive call doctor go health centre place set vaccination. Right think calling born 1964 1966, although groups people vaccinated profession age.

- way get vaccinated, vaccines cannot bought think anyone wants buy knockoff brands. happened AstraZeneca, people want ""the good vaccine"", many call Pfizer-Biotech vaccine. 

There also danger government distributing ""fake"" vaccines, otherwise rate vaccination would ridiculously slow. think reason videos exist go viral get views. pompous. wanted make something convince vaccine skeptics people recommending vaccine touch hit nail head. afford fly japan maybe could stop rural Texas get least one dose vaccines sitting around. I'm sure athletes vaccinated care. blows away. thought sure Japan would one highest vaccinated countries. guess didn’t know mistrust vaccines general.

Also, they’ve 10,000 deaths *total* 15 months, opposed nearly 600,000 US, guess people Japan aren’t worried covid. constantly shit on? thought people pretty happy rate America. probably good US right this. Saying “believe” something certain way doesn’t absolve spreading misinformation. Alex Jones Tucker Carlsons world create much chaos. vaccinated????? swipe right yes. gaping mouth holes???? OMG past year done number people. spread misinformation. want feel good part. went actual event filming boring, self-righteous waste 5 hours entire life.

Also, Selena Gomez worst host ever seen eyes. don’t know one else seems noticed lifeless was. crazy follow rollout progress since December, first milestone outnumbering UK covid cases Vaccines administered, ever since ramped up.

Endlessly thankful everyone who's worked hard ensure rollout's moving efficiently throughout whole period. easing restrictions come hopefully make even easier. Dr Pfizer

I'm glad got priorities straight. issue eliminating stigma associated masking. different Muslim woman wearing head scarf whatever. ain't hurting anyone, gives hoot. really see wearing masks indoors longer becomes thing. care less anyone else chooses so. DC metro area see people wear masks outdoors everywhere... running, biking, kayaking, playing tennis, nobody within 50 feet even 100 yards.

I understand it. like allergies. air become toxic. need infected another person. agree, kind security blanket. interesting see remaining time COVID pandemic plays out. one hand, urban areas mask wearing higher vaccination rates see sustained reduction COVID cases. hand, rural areas rejected mask wearing, vaccination, etc. tend congregate together outside church school functions, likely continue smaller outbreaks groups enough sustained pandemic. think future COVID probably going like would always see reports norovirus outbreaks cruise ships such. cases drop there's going newsworthy items somewhat large outbreak tied specific event. really. something people say make severe symptoms feel better really evidence else equal severe symptoms means immune system stronger. important thing watch  1% Japanese population vaccinated yet America constantly shit Reddit vaccination rate.

If bad, nobody would want doctor. money good, low acceptance rates med schools. thought sold Texas rangers game month two ago? think really good secondary effects mask wearing think evaluate society outside COVID. flu season basically non-existent past winter. mind mask wearing became common thing people sick enough coughing sneezing public example. Additionally, think might nice people food prep continue wearing masks job likely would help reduce spread various diseases too. countries waiting till safe, variant could escape whole new game. safer option wait.

Quarantine test. don’t blame you. same. soon masks longer required/preferred, mine good. Live Singapore, can’t overstate crazy is. Big props passengers remaining polite helpful (even handing mask, thus providing chance avoid serious consequences act (in previous cases: hefty fine, deportation, permanent ban entering country). travel bubbles vaccine hesitant though  Huh? people hate masks everywhere. 

As American, surprised learn many people countries ""believe"" science. You’re downvoted spread covid vaccinated unvaccinated incredibly unlikely occurrence.   
And thankfully don’t use China shot *Sam Wilson liked this*  proven safe afterwards.

there side effects? risks outweigh benefits also viruses waiting y'all remotely alone. I'm fully vaccinated I'm done masks. they're required obviously wear cause choice unless I'm strictly required take off. second even say 'it's required still recommend one' wearing one unless maybe go store I'm sick.  Meanwhile Trump anti-mask anti-vaccines. would millions dying every day won. Yeah, that's something hope comes this. Life happens can't always stay home. go grocery store sick, wear gd mask.

The thing is, hope begin take ventilation buildings seriously. respiratory diseases. think you’d okay. It’s beautiful country beautiful people everywhere. actually show vaccination cards? group social activities since vaccines hit I'm curious people since that's sounded like description. heard right. powerful religion ""monastries"" insisted full fledged event symbolic event Like everyone else Connecticut, enjoy living Connecticut, least 99% time people masks properly social distancing, local CVS always full people getting jab.

(I still see idiots masks exposing nose sometimes. Specifically, workplace, Amazon building everybody sort suffering anomie. Nobody ever tries pull shit grocery store wherever, though.)  Congrats CT! I'd say everyone got opportunity get vacine. Aiight. Mexico first. rest Latin America. we'll spread Oceania. CM state removed position for""other"" reasons tried push less crowded symbolic event. no. proof vacination required enter country. Haha think win one. We'll enough supply 100% partially vaccinated + 50% fully first week July. seem understand appointment scheduled 4 months mean can't moved up. kind feel way too. 3 4 us family fully vaccinated almost care everyone else chooses do. soon vaccinate 13 year old bets off.

Of course potentially unknown long term effects virus. one say potentially unknown long term effects vaccine. happened. Spent minute googling find this, results crowded covid vaccine articles hard find info older vaccines without specific knowledge one look seems like psychological developmental consequences locking child away box year however many years deemed ""safe"" greatly outweighs hypotheticals especially risk young children initial course virus extremely low day day risk factors nearly everyone tolerated prior sars2. freedom!! kids back school. without restrictions half half hybrid learning. True best would hearsay. person told would one turn in. don’t know books, kind creative accounting try cover asses. source, however, knows quite bit, won’t flip. believe words were, “He said didn’t take money someone else would have. that’s true, know!” (Insert diatribe takers whatever.) I’m Australia, vaccinations mandatory also don’t huge percentage antivaxx idiots country people vaccinate Fauci needs specific things. always says phrases like ‘significantly closer back normal’ ‘cases still high come we’ll able relax restrictions’ things open interpretation. normal mean? mean masks things like nightclubs fully open packed dance floors stadiums 100% attendance? many cases specifically need occurring per day happen? would ‘normal’ next year anything since say it’ll ‘as close normal get’? hate people take says context also hate lack clear goals. saw someone today say ‘we need mask weeks, don’t people listen’. saw exact comment early April, ‘just weeks.’ That’s I’m sick generic talking points clear goal. Fucking people, specific way get others listen. Small adjustment, 94% less likely symptomatic disease. Infection altogether seems (naturally) bit lower around 90% given later studies Same, though it’s since February  immune system making feverish achey, virus actually doing?

Destroying cells forcing replicate virus run energy die. zero immune response would feel breath randomly keep taking bigger gasps air drop dead. (Assuming absolutely zero immune response produce inflammation fluid lungs virus destroys it.) 1 dose drive mask on? That’s COVID-19 spread droplets air stay air hours. might one there, someone come hour later still get sick you. Nope, 94% reduction means you’re 94% less likely simply get COVID all. trials that’s exactly 94% came from, forget exact numbers like 180 people got infected phase 3 trials 8 something vaccinated group. comes hospitalization death results even better ONE vaccinated needed hospitalized. real world it’s 100% we’ve seen it’s pretty damn close. vaccine way effective thinking, totally reduce risk getting COVID (not hospitalization like people tiktok keep wrongly regurgitating) even makes basically guarantee won’t go hospital you’re one get it. Go gym man, you’re fine. It’s interesting listening people’s fears next phase. Everyone edge right now. see concern. I’m actually afraid mask scolds getting upset stop wearing masks situations might escalate. We’re worried things, think highlights anxiety permeates society right now. Everyone seems afraid berated others don’t see eye eye with.

2020 affected everyone deeply, think long-lasting effect utter lack trust people others. Aside lives lost, worry consequential impact pandemic don’t see gets better. acknowledging willing lie/bend truth feel lead better outcomes. issue now, wanting pretend like vaccinated people still threats spread virus. know incredibly rare think helpful lie this. hard wait everyone chance get vaccinated shed masks. everyone want actually gets jab, anti maskers vaxxers still forced wear masks inside. since we're carding people walk supermarket, wear mask.  Automod decided meanie? wasn't. seem agree everything one thing. 

If libertarian socialist thing I'd fall somewhere umbrella seem mutually exclusive. 

How get along? want people disagree this? I'm saying let's start text chain know fix this. us. 

We're odds, even loathe things. 

Look, decent conversation wish nicer disagree with. whole thing make rude less trusting. 2020 whatever. Patriot Act started it. Eh, whatever. 

What options? I'm asking ironically. I'm wondering think. 

Thank civil discussion.  point specific incident: CDC producing test kits performing test kit analysis room performing virus experiments. cross-contamination.

This JV league error delayed rollout test program eventually CDC gave let commercial firms provide tests. Eversource bill comes ...you know, maybe vaccines *should* microchips all. like conspiracy theories anyway, would let us know actually vaccine too. Yeah, would much better run PPE gear every American massive shortage front line workers. I'm sure even healthcare workers die would served us well. It’s need eat out. You’re oversimplifying know it. need resume normalcy. suspended animation we’ve 15 months healthy. need see other, talk, laugh, hug, sometimes large groups, without fear. need social animals see other’s faces live normal life. 

I get you’re scared feel slighted. cannot slow march progress - ultimately - small subset people. Ya, let’s honest, vaccines effective mRNA almost certainly going stop transmission. Still fully understand ""if ease guidance vaccinated, it'll incentivize people get shots"", people willingly get vaccinated currently follow guidance like idea isn’t never going feasible everyday life. Businesses hire extra employees check every person enters vaccine passport. people would start forging them. much drama. polio spreading shifted behavior long period time vaccine available. Polio might best comparison since caused long term debilitation, death. risk mild case becoming long term health issue like diabetes still studied answer, risk calculations flawed. 

Let’s see much cases actually plummet. dropping remain unacceptably high levels many populous states still mask mandates place. 

We probably disagree issue, view societal failure parents take incomplete difficult actions protect children things able control. example, let children house guns present, view fact even make choice glaring failure society actually limit risk gun violence children (and people general).  wear masks required now. can't wait gone. Yeah 60%+ vaccinated 30%+ got disease, obviously lot crossover percentages starts edging towards herd immunity level. And...there's really number shuts Covid, it'll keep dropping community spread slow, eventually outbreaks clumped communities low vaccination levels, etc. 

It's even like ""need"" certain number, higher numbers always better lower numbers worse.  made Connecti-cut however, take consideration reopening plans. example, forcing work environment puts danger. ""go back normal"" without plan accommodate that, we're saying society care less fortunate. suppose already accurate statement. Millions would died? vaccine rollout began end Trump’s term. initial orders hundreds millions doses Pfizer Moderna placed. Front line medical workers getting shots.  Well knew masks helpful CDC saying otherwise maybe expert ways.  It’s ethical duty take health others seriously take themselves. study reveals they're really necessary outdoors unless close quarters.

And yet SF area people still wearing outdoors low density areas even though state county rules revised require last week.

Seems like security blanket.   Within next 3-8 weeks trends continue down. I’d rather safe sorry give people warning stay several feet away. 

Plus masks prevent giving others. Even come across anti-mask person, yet to, wear one won’t get sick. gray area. US continues vaccines people getting comfortable going without mask. 

Where weekend, many people going without mask. Even older people weren’t wearing mask. 

At times one coffee shop store mask on.  

I fully vaccinated ready drop mask. official number 819 end January April 19, 75 breakthrough cases/week, may finally trending overall cases finally falling, would assume right 1000 today. compares 106,965 unvaccinated cases timeframe. think said right - you’re used wearing mask normal, non-pandemic life. I’m speaking generally here, Americans used feels uncomfortable us wear look at. It’s hard us adapt don’t know ever become permanent fixture culture. It’s good bad thing one way - is. Everybody continues ignoring turn attention protesting seat belt laws. feel way living Pacific Northwest. Now, cost living could come down...   real stats? nonsense. Anyone vaccinated fired. Thank you, hope you. always norm. get 23 different kinds vaccines 7 booster shots old vaccines get Visa attend Carnegie Mellon. nut shut up. Yake fucking vaccines way.  There's difference possibilities probabilities.

One taught fat dudes trying overthrow government, middle-school level math. White House chose follow pandemic plan. isn’t true all. people end misinformed? I’m AL people it’s 3/4 masking. think officially kids 2 don’t wear one enforces either way. eek, would turned heel left place. That's 3% population, significant portion immunocompromised receive even benefits vaccinations. cannot put society hold relatively small part population. think CSU system hybrid/online. Community colleges still deciding. Likely though. know what, I'd like see that. Please film going target wearing clothes post here. I'll get popcorn ready suicidal, murderous. 

In case wish donate, list verified organizations may wish know about: experts said othewise, would still think good idea wait? many delays vaccinations here, starting get old, especially society partially locked down. friends family US vaccinated least month. Germany, announced AZ J&amp;J available without prioritization. think Japan progressive?  People WANT vaccines. Tokyo's fixed phone line system went last week phone appointments started huge numbers people called in. In-person vaccination sites seeing massive turnouts.

The demand there, ability deliver there.

Partially issue Japan's medical system pushed beyond reasonable limits. Japan less doctors per capita OECD average. Japanese doctor see patients per year OECD average; 4x patients year American doctor, nearly 10x patients Swedish doctor. Wages low, schools limited even medical emergency doctors warning collapse coming. I'm actually afraid infected them. concerned puppers (and mammals health). keep thinking poor tigers caught trainers. go see KFC, cake romance a. small percentage Japanese Christian seen specific studies outdoor bars, believe studies suggest outdoor spread almost nonexistant unless basically standing top other. Florida never overwhelmed hospitals, either. People need pick new hill die pick Florida.   mean I'm making 12 days Christmas joke. Day 5. 5 gold rings. . Currently india manufacturing 4 million vaccines day. population billion. Even vaccinate everyday, single doses administered 300+ days. Every one needs two doses every six months. So, conclusion situation hopeless.  vaccines approved children fall. 100% confident never variant might evade currently available vaccines?

There degree. immune system evasive variant south african strain, mRNA vaccines still something like 80 percent effective. Plus, always come booster shots targeted new varients. Japanese really protesting type probably bigger deal looks. There's definitely nonsense passing science communication really confused goal audience is. Providing new analogies people already getting vaccinated getting vaccine dumb going convince people nursing incorrect reasoning wanting vaccine safe worthwhile. accident.

This Gates' equivalent swiping right. measures could taken prevent this, like limiting disallowing crowds? Japan far behind this? excellent scientists/medicine culture would seem open science vaccines? barrage texts email ""20% off"" used get stopped giving info says bullshit.

I don’t believe you’re saying never got spam texts Covid briefly pandemic suddenly halted supposedly stopped complying company rules entering case, sounds like guy absolutely right. need number.

How inferring this? old guy left told no, need number. imply didn’t need main point though push back younger person says give phone number. guy old, treated differently

Again, actual post getting information? OP nowhere states cashier let young people refused give number. fair curse cashier don’t know something OP never said did? seems complaint shifted targeted advertising ageist practices. can't wait visit Pittsburgh again. much long, already taste Pamelas breakfast  According published RCT clinical data, efficacy Asian subgroup 100% Moderna 74.4% efficacy Pfizer. I'd take extra side effects Moderna extra 25% boost efficacy anyday.

I'm going data shows. Moderna available, would take Pfizer. Heck, I'd even take JnJ nothing. Imagine telling athlete that’s preparing 1 maybe 2 Olympic Games they’ll athletically qualified participate don’t get compete because…. u/tahkyn thinks it’ll dull.

Thank you!  used bothered (fully vaccinated) pregnant woman feel sick time we're super sensitive carbon dioxide breathing rough.

I got vaccine doses, worried fever hurting baby, continue stay home day every day mask nauseating I'm incredibly breath time.

I could switch disposable type air flows around mask instead still touch mouth disgusting. know pregnancy self inflicted still, where's benefit vaccine still stay home? think you’re getting reserved conservative confused.  positive 50% still great milestone number. lag, sure, 50% get second shots, still make huge difference. Wow we're really getting downvoted, we? understand it. I'm fairly new Reddit. people downvote stuff want hear? factual offensive. Odd. 25k cases sunday. That's lowest one day total since summer. IDK, would argue that's plummeting. mean, don’t completely hate Japan, jfc place frustrating times. Romanian o/

So order get vaccine, need get national vaccination website, create account using details ID Card. so, choose make appointment get vaccine. state city vaccination centre wish go to. that, either put waiting list lot people ahead you, get turn (or centre enough room waiting list) asked choose date time (you select date time enough room). also add people account, say, grandma, create separate account her.

Sometimes, process quick, called earlier get it. example, programmed get vaccine 7pm called asked could come one hour early.

Sounds like lot easier countries. human nature laugh accident cause harm reason worry countries think. there’s studies starting, predicted: Norway must really weird then, like 1 30K. and? Congress still Bolsonaro leash. 

You idea military dictatorship think Brazil one. 

And Glenn said Brazil military dictatorship right lose respect work... would show actually idea wtf going here. you’re fan people studied particular topic others? NY 60% first shots, good. much longer Perhaps responsible vaccine acquisition distribution also flipping them? They've already said foreign travelers. They've spent tons get nothing back, especially bad since like one Olympics last 4 decades turned profit Mine better....I want go back office. I'm happy home Congrats wedding! quick. live Japan far best explanation I've seen here. Lots people commenting seem really understand we're slow rollout.

And yea...don't even get started Olympics. tired either focus getting. don’t think equate first world countries only. depends situation country. low levels infections think good idea avoid adenovirus vaccines wait mRNA ones, even means waiting longer. ANOTHER good day Netherlands: 
Deaths: Dropping average again, 1/day 
Vaccinations: 116K, first time 5 days didnt break daily record, alltime record sundays. 
Infected: Lowest since april 5th! 
Covid deniers (they call virus mania) declared wrong legality corona measures judges. 
Scheduled 1 Million vaccinations week (highest time) 
Reopening likely go further, foreign travel allowed several countries starting May 18th. still speak absolutes. 100% confident never variant might evade currently available vaccines?

Also, specifically talking **unvaccinated** kids. Yesterday wife girlfriend...he's pandering. 

Will interesting see plays out. Everything suddenly safe may need masks anymore. thought enough getting vaccinated last week we're good now! 12-16 year olds approved week. 

Pfizer Moderna said ~ September 2-11 year olds based results far older kids (excellent). govt seems decided 1 dose arms better 2 doses fewer arms. Right now, hospital staff getting 2nd dose 50 yr olds getting first. pretty good distribution think supply problem. sound like ""plummeting"" me. [North went average 140 new cases per day May 1 114 May 8. 

If go 24% ~140 again, would call ""surge""? confirm, wife Japanese recently convinced vaccines may safe. She'd rather wait year. I'm vaccinated, still going likely support states right thing tourist money. everything happened last year, really saw lot people's true colors motives year recent history. know harmful well people can't control state in, going difficult justify spending money states like Florida disappointing. people

Reminds midwife called patients 'birthers' 'those birth' avoid twitter mob. reading this, going say feels like rant said lol. 

I’m still really surprised want push olympics knowing countries don’t share view vaccines do. govt prideful something??  Differs regionally even within countries.

I'm Poland, first dose.

We general rollout still relatively older people (~60 ish age), companies work local municipalities additional people vaccinated sharing info resources. city main vaccination centre + drive uses variants less stringent storage temperature requirement (JJ AZ) unused variants day.

You call send text designated line, wait call/ text back. much input required, certainly shady dealings. Rollout done local level - one wants spotlight what's happen next. massively risk adverse culture Japan unexpected handled poorly. really seems like we're hitting saturation point number people want get vaccinated.

It's getting harder harder find unvaccinated people extra dose end day number people coming get vaccinated dropped significantly.

Unless antivaxxers come Rona we're going able hit herd immunity. straight went elsewhere Chipotle forced us order phones punch credit card number ourselves. understand use technology horribly inconvenient everywhere else lets tap credit card. Indeed. New Haven. 

It’s funny say CT rich. looking Fairfield? Go tell people live Bridgeport, New Haven, Waterbury, Hartford 70% state rich. 

Sure rich people live CT highly concentrated suburbs around New Haven, Hartford, Fairfield many people work New York. feel you. sending whatever help, look videos it’s terrible sinking feeling see. mention isn’t India problem, it’s going become everyone’s problem don’t get help. think either would cause riots. ask differentiating moderna pfizer? They're insanely similar Broken record player still broken  Japan, chronic pain syndrome. cases reported firm evidence tie vaccine, Japan's tolerance risk similar things famously low. Plenty cases decide pretty close certain benefit outweighs costs good certain enough. can't cure stupid.... riding train anytime soon. appears. Trying three weeks now. AZ free all, doctors advertise NoBoDy wAnTs overrun people want it. Last weekend 500 doses administered 9am-2pm, 8:30 600 people queue. Meanwhile doctor estimating mid June vaccine centers say ""no appointments, try later"". hotline queue, says ""plz try later, three phones busy""

/rant  That's good sign (so far). Mississippi? ""fucked"" mean vaccine might bit less effective version virus, perhaps. love celebrating milestones! No. doesn’t matter whose fault relation masks. thing matters creating deadly variants. needs happen schools need require vaccine enter. Otherwise safety variants. Fucking terrible situation there, imagine sitting field burning bodies, never die like this. India needs new pm. article paywalled. 

My question know hesitancy pause, rather news blood clots? really explain though?

Like think could get 99% large population agree anything, let alone disdain vaccines.

Like even 5% population formed evidence based opinions, would 5 times number already vaccinated. That's good.

So arbitrary goal met, they'll reopen. Right?

...Right?  1% vaccinated stage pandemic one richest technologically advanced countries world beyond comprehension me.  vaccines work variants. parents-in-law appointment get vaccine middle June. They’re 80s vaccine first made available seniors last month. It’s hesitancy they’re vaccinated late.  knows many doses Moderna 30mil doses Astrazeneca. least 100M doses storage Japan right now, clear plan use them. Again, adreno vaccines suffered production problems. Merck handled production there's every chance they'd suffered similar scale well. genuinely think EU implemented export controls UK scenario? Especially plenty Anglophobes eager us continue bear brunt death toll...

AZ definitely overpromised underdelivered I'm defending that. However understand everyone pleased UK death rate government want EU's mercy time relations fraught, decided ensure went company domestic production. I'm definitely fan government, turned good decision definitely reduced deaths actually hope. Sorry prefer otherwise, maybe focus country rather spending time hating another? recollection CT resident. 

Granted live rural area mostly saw others hiking paths trails, it’s long time since saw many people masks outdoors.  state absolute fact. *possibility* variants hitting unvaccinated kids start packing classrooms many communities ditch masks? Um, yes, children play role spread also, rare, serious complications long haul issues covid. I’m sick people acting like kids aren’t also people part pandemic need protected. ALSO, people vaccinated (including young children), safer people legitimately cannot receive vaccine be. vaccine effective (the bee elderly, people immunocompromised, people organ transplants, HIV positive people, list goes on). used smoking sections, people realized smoke stay designated section. like peeing section swimming pool.

Unfortunately, we're breathing air. best try influence around showing good example leadership (and shaming them). think they're referring small risk blood clots associated AZ vaccine. admit morbid curiosity happen New Zealand Australia lower gates.

If still 10-20% unvaccinated time open, suspect number quickly drop 0-5% antivaxers start getting sick large numbers quickly. see friends hospital, lose family members, change tune.

Weird. second shot, dick gained couple inches. Ignoring relaxation outdoor masks rules, literal article relaxing rules factors mentioned? dense? So, 60% people vaccinated 30% people got Covid, assume people got Covid likely get vaccinated people get Covid, would translate 78% people either getting vaccinated, getting Covid, both. guess would people got Covid would somewhat less likely get vaccinated, mostly guess.  I'm finance anything, maybe, reason got cought money spent said stupid things Good quality masks (n99, ffp3) special seal around soft skin. Might worth trying too. suspect NYC getting absolutely fucked covid early, long, hard pretty substantial impact vaccination rates surrounding region.

The region whole might generally better vaccinations (I know, numbers front moment), know northeast would leading pack front row seat witness horror 17,000 New Yorkers dying April 2020. wearing life jacket captain ship advises everyone good idea. No, wearing life jacket day day life avoid drowning would considered tad overzealous 50 miles nearest body water. 

If vaccinated area low prevalence overall risk level negates need wearing masks.

Which policy masks changing relaxing FDA approved ones, sure India poor country. Another lockdown destroy economy. first lockdown led -24% growth GDP. Also, India doesn’t state capacity properly enforce lockdown. Well, vaccinated reasonable reaction. way. I’m falling shit. I'm afraid. I'm wearing mask like experts recommend. wearing seatbelt fear based decision? precisely feel act. part, im done it. Definitely. think CEO part responsible this. never gave straight answer asked question. Always blamed supply chain, gave information turned either incorrect slightly misleading (and therefore also correct). Knowingly unknowingly doesn’t make big difference. really, depends prevalence risk factor unvaccinated individual. 

For instance 20 something exceptionally low risk bad outcome would nothing fear vaccinated individual.

Similarly, prevalence low like many areas would similarly ridiculous afraid are. example UK prevalence something like 1 1100 makes meeting vaxxed individual low risk Also people need stable families support systems better mental health. Look friends, take care them, staying away drugs addictions , avoiding junk foods simple things people healthy state mind.  Ah good old stockholm syndrome. know much, could still unsafe unvaccinated people around vaccinated people. 

I take position, quoted reputable source.  Sunday data, wait days announce dip. data shows vaccines cut transmission, pinning exactly much takes time requires peer review.

That's different positing vaccines prevent transmission, counter real world data. worry - wearing mask outside utter nonsense - outside transmission never proven significant infection vector. [MSM Yeh nah Australia indefinite travel ban moment. repatriation flight allowed mandatory quarantine mutations necessarily equal vaccine escape, evidenced fact thousands variants COVID yet handful marked variants concern; even reduce efficacy full vaccine escape.

Are prepared live fear rest life? know instance could wiped ejection sun moment would best get minutes warning die. mean live lives?  Yeah surprised too, according ourworldindata 10% vaccine doses delivered far. Germany doses still vaccinating 60's moment.

But seems, Australia restricting use Pfizer 50 year old only? anyone 50 eligible AZ? correct I'm wrong. Someone followed mandates anti masker?  Southeast Asia, it’s hot people mandatory mask orders months time, acne/dermatitis complaints common. Congrats Connecticut! Sincerely, Oklahoman sadly never know percentage 😔 takeout last night Burger place full maskless people tables talking eating. 

The horror! People enjoying life year shit. vaccinated, enjoy life? No, that's bad actually. reason becoming available younger people taken others. live time unprecedented numbers entertainment choices home. Electronic TV games like Nintendos Sonys, etc, Net-Flix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Apple Video, etc. 

And that, grocery chains offer delivery groceries home even leave home obtain perishable goods.

Want Olive Garden Ruby Tuesday? GrubHub, Ubereats, use curbside pickup (higher risk factor even mask, pretty low compared entering restaurant dining in).

Point is, plenty ways keep occupied comfort home even extended periods time. 

I acknowledge need leave home things like doctor exams whatnot, cases recommend well fitted N95 mask - press nose clip putting onto cleanly shaven face form proper seal around nose.

Want socialize? Avail number free video chat/conferencing services available. Want socialize without anyone watching like NSA? Use Signal also offers video chatting. Realtime face face socialization without need physically room. Administered guy named Vlad I’m wearing mask outside also live less densely populated area. I’m waiting green light longer inside. 50s want Pfizer? discrimination (according state laws) restrict age. Yeah, Ireland. Uptake ranged 95% 106% among cohorts already done, I'd suspect much lower Australia since much fewer total doses given. showed picture vaccination card. keep apparently stolen places. get feeling would JD's movie script Scrubs. difference perspective east asian oceania countries goal break viral transmission entirely, opposed western countries virus completely endemic cannot eradicated. US vaccinated large swaths population, yet still 600 people dying per day COVID. 

So American, 77 cases seem like miniscule amount. one countries chain transmission kept broken, 77 cases lot, numbers risk exponential growth overwhelm contact tracing response.  ...and? provide reason said government would falsely accuse Sputnik V good expected? 

I'm asking ***opinion*** would lie, I'm asking share something proves government gains something lying fashion. 

Extra points reason lie ""military dictatorship banana republic"". Lockdowns delay it. reopen explode unless vaccines. India cannot afford lockdown 1 year require get vaccinated actually impression getting vaccine means pandemic you? 
 
For part, yes. I'm happy get booster shot necessary.  yes, point I've done part vaccinated I'm ready begin rest life whenever can. aren't, officially. names things like B.1.151, etc., since they're difficult remember layperson, news outlets refer region.  Man basically Covid politicians time. days ago, around 20th April, group Indian students Belgium identified cluster. Half approx. 40 students is, lost track one infected students. know finally found reported authorities...

Like supposed inform infected lost details, like knew infected jumped quarantine? cares indeed, humans borders man made. brutally honest, death exactly uncommon event nursing homes, point life one well die e.g. flu. 

When population vaccinated, doubt worth maintaining restrictions (which normally mean residents cannot go out, visited loved ones, etc. life much worse) prevent occasional deaths infrequent cases vaccine enough. brain use thinking common sense. Something don’t probably  France particularly sceptical vaccines Europe.

In Wales we're 60% adults vaccinated signs slowing yet, we're probably pretty good bellwether rest UK respond reach similar amount (first doses fallen England/Scotland/NI focus second dosing people first jabs months ago we're strongly supply limited - suggests pick first doses back still significant enthusiasm there). think they're right, cases still plummeting  also T1 diabetes autoimmune issues, 2nd shot Pfizer basically sore arm slightly sleepy. real side effects, meanwhile wife stabbing back pain fever. Really depends body. You’re allowed ditch mask lol reason order more. pace currently delivering already ordered doses, EU gets deliveries well 2022. whole idea well people showing vaccination cards work cards available PDF form many county, state even federal health websites. got curious weeks back google search see easy find copy cards. found PDF form local county state government health department websites even CDC website. 

So agree completely. step across line wear don't. cross line together. hide show me. don’t think co-workers statement correct I’ve read. bad side effects vaccine terrible thing side effects doesn’t mean vaccine didn’t work Fauci lied multiple times pandemic, he's Public Relations Officer doctor point. reputable government scientists listen ever seen cafes Paris? LOL, seriously, I'm ready restaurants least re-open outdoor dining. take-out delivery past 6 months. Yeah need add points too... lol Ok... could Google instead pretending know talking *not* million people going Japan olympics. Yea talked australian friend recently. way australia victim success. bar set complete eradication virus. worked far draconian border rules. unless borders stay are, sooner later COVID going enter country. way around get herd immunity vaccines, say seems difficult incentivize 80% people get vaccine virus hasnt really existed there. Oh. see beer exchanged. think ""we're need it"". 

If people need incentive, fine. Start offering money. that's takes get place might chance. Great. already posted Reposts removed. antivaxers start getting sick large numbers quickly. 

If two countries wait 80%+ vaccinated opening borders simply wont enough susceptible people cause rapid surge infections. Perhaps likely see hot spots, probably centred around communities high anti-vax sentiment. see measles, general public generally immune clusters infection emerge things like church groups particular pre-schools.

I expect hot spots managed way measles outbreaks managed, local measures health departments (testing, closing church etc) society watches wondering thought good idea avoid vaccines. worried chief know there’s social conservatism American race gender issues. many people think work nurses? guess Biden set goal smart people crunched numbers told 70% 7/4 likely. can’t money lockdowns? lockdowns would potential disastrous economic results well. 

I don’t see paid unpaid liability argument EU’s conservative approach. 

I actually don’t get wtf you’re talking tbh.   Sure, reason brought pregnancy risk clots (what fear) greater BC prevent BC itself... particularly sensible. guess use alternatives worried it, nearly every BC sort risk. Jimmy Kimmel think people failing make connection masks less viral infections kinds. Makes sad. get vaccinated 4Head Interesting, seems like USA's preference chaos organization actually helped distribution, hah. really like working home, could tolerate four months it.

What shaming bullying LOT society daring go outside one point. never grocery delivery variety reasons. Shamed it. found hiking trails stayed open went hiking weekends get house. Shamed it. went back work office opened voluntary returns good workspace home. Shamed it. Expressed dislike online classes. Shamed it.

When friend (now former friend) tells grandparents deserved die went hiking (spoiler alert: neither died covid), kind messes head while. happened 5 rings? Either cancel games make sure there’s huge crowds audiences athletes vaccinated. think athletes vaccinated would better since waited whole lives moment. Athletes coming different countries = breeding ground variants. Maybe they’ll mutate there’ll Olympic variant 😒 again, proven way credentialed make decisions, literally never said forever. low enough background cases (1 1000 risk) enough people vaccinated. We’re there, trending way.

Also, no. It’s gradient: full 46% never generated detectable immune response: whole: education far lacking may want listen public health professionals like Fauci. Nothing wrong knowing whole story, dangerous little understanding speak confidentially. much transmissible. deadly. Point 1 2 Germany, yet already vaccinated third population Wtf talking about, that's bullshit See mythbusters episode anecdotal proof. Pfizer. need wait 3 weeks get 2nd dose vs 4 moderna May 8th V-E day, former Soviet countries celebrate Victory Day May 9th already 9th USSR time due time zone difference Matsumoto know, really care long 5 persons total 130K(at time) vaccinated Norway died AZ vaccine. mostly healthcare infrastructure overwhelmed.

They messed wave Also, let's forget people countries *want* vaccine.

No one talking fact vaccines happening quickly America fraction population actually plans getting them.

I'm Indiana, first 2 weeks opened vaccines everyone people actually wanted them.  got mine Walgreens NC 2 months ago (first shot), whole process super easy. used online tool find location near me, booked appointment, walked day 20ish minutes, line. Almost everything except concerts stadiums open next week. still 40s vaccinate
 Unlike US demand plenty vaccines opposite UK. also viruses besides covid still. unit university Psychology course ways address public. initially like, ""Why needed? I'm Psych, Public Relations!"", went unit, realized important is.

If new research breakthrough, research poorly presented, misconceptions, exaggerations, monetary malpractice (such clickbaits) harm research. also write correct audience (such use jargon, use layman terms), correct platform (blog post/academic paper/tweet) best summarize main points research.  [Integration Human making doctors give vaccine? local pharmacy public health nurse? Indiana ended mask mandates April 6th businesses wished enforce could, schools government buildings still mask mandate. 

So basically nothing changed Indiana, enforcing masking before, still depends whether state/local gov walk-in areas set up. pharmacy chains accept walk-ins people miss appointments. Otherwise, still need appointments.

Of course, nowadays much easier get next-day even same-day appointments since demand slowing down. Mask use almost costless compared alternatives.

Only USA bitching much using them.

I'm MD, used regularly pandemic use later.

Just use one carry on, violation humans rights Oh heard brewery. giving free six pack exchange people getting vaccinated right? You’d think catching deadly disease incentive enough 🤷‍♂️  think people failing make connection masks less viral infections kinds. Makes sad. Yes, think whole exchange great micro example that. would imagine many barely grasp conservatism means entirely remove Christianity, central tenet American conservatism, equation. That's really cool, links relevant literature, I'd like read it. I've waiting immigrate year disaster. Millions vaccines storage, nurses can't trusted inject people, lockdown basically bars closed 8pm. bullshit thousands visa holders can't enter country year due covid, domestically anything themselves. Cancel Olympics let workers students in. Initially semi-organised. people certain ages conditions could get it. make appointment local hospital clinic would go get it. Nothing fancy make appointment, one. Since expanded groups adults make appointments. people went got soon could, now, that's left part vaccine hesitant, unfortunately lot. result though, fairly low demand places still swamped starting walk ins.

When went second shot example, literally 1 person getting shot. appointment, got there, line walked got shot immediately Good lord- making exception? Giving someone shot rocket surgery stretch imagination. Yeah counted precious years died. said 800 more.  ...probably 96% audience already vaccinated. Unfortunately black Americans long extensive history medically abused purely racist reasons. Tuskegee comes mind immediately, banned black people seeking treatment syphilis order better understand affected them, despite disease WELL understood point, ""researchers"" even tell syphilis spreading disease loved ones, maximizing suffering. honestly can't hold specific skeptics LOT nuance. think it'll easier people come around seeing others vaxxed opposed antivaxxers. get Walmart pharmacies here. could get Brewery day. giving burgers city incentive get people vaccinated. Counties usually profit olympics. LA olympics ones have. London spent 18 billion made 5.2 billion. increase coal production. great secret, something many people decided ignore. Covid endemic like flu.  I’m sure it’s paternalism understanding per se main factor here. 

If look religious political leaders many people follow, take far paternalistic even authoritarian line. Jimmy Swaggart saying “God sent us vaccine thwart Satan’s disease,” you’d lining around block. 

They don’t degrees theology, accept they’re told fundamentalist ministers. don’t degrees economics, they’ll accept idea welfare bad economy can’t raise minimum wage without creating inflation, they’re told political leaders. 

It’s appealing intellect, making feel like they’re talked to. It’s getting trust network. correct. I've watched enough Japanese cinema know there's least sizeable subset people Japan avoid birth control. Oh no... money.... Biden's goal 70% adults July 4th. Kids factor one way goal. Yep driving walking work area, 90 minutes per day. 6 hours week. Going hard go back work full time. glad I’ve opportunity made much could. actually great plan shortage. know single shot mRNA vaccines provides 80% efficacy two weeks- already better numbers AZ vaccine even J&amp;J. Yeah no.

First time since Mar 2020 believe. reason stopped mandating vaccines Japan, general, due legal liabilities. probably that. think there's concern two main things:

- new strain entering country

- doubt people coming country vaccinated. Even everyone country vaccinated, it'd hard spreading-ground COVID aren't. requirements athletes etc vaccinated. Currently show without appointment many places there’s much supply. late April, however, appointment only. Prior mid April (I’m estimating) difficult find open appointment time. Everybody US aged 16 older eligible get vaccine. close 2024 ones overlapping 2022 winter ones

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 22K Sunday, per nyt page linked article back even exposure virus activated immune response. Meaning person get infected, exposed somebody close proximity, still bodies natural defensive reaction it. Somehow body respond even infected. Wish could find article, blew mind concerning capabilities human body defend itself.

Every little bit counts we're considering herd immunity.  Polio's worldwide vaccination campaign took literally decades.

I know hoping decades lockdowns happen. entire country eligible right now.

Except anyone 16... Wearing mask easy think many people. I’m hard hearing rely lot reading lips. Masks make everyday interactions difficult. Also, mask acne freaking sucks. approval fall

Full FDA approval expected within weeks. six month data requirement met (by Pfizer, first tested - others weeks behind that) Pfizer submitted approval last week.  Otherwise, trial testing criteria emergency approval (already met least 3 different vaccine makers US) ""full"" approval essentially identical, additional 6 months data.

Thus far, vaccines proven safest effective ever developed.   suppose anything possible, would strange see delay approval. AZ uses 12 week gap approved Pfizer. study done early May something, time around 1 million people 2nd AZ dose least 2 weeks before.

In group 1 million, Covid deaths (yet), meaning can't accurately assess effectiveness. Although theoretically could 100% effective preventing death, reality likely high 100%. important note theoretical sense, yes would logical way look it. proteins going existing together moving fluid different affinity binding other. virus survive needs high affinity binding spike ACE2 order attach cells taken up. immune system, need high affinity binding antibodies spike protein prevent virus able bind ACE2. actual neutralization virus going complex process depends concentrations antibodies, viral load, etc etc. 

In general though individual antibody short sequence (or protein conformation) recognizes high specificity affinity. means small changes potential greatly effect antibody binding since made specific. protected though generating polyclonal responses lot epitopes also process somatic hypermutation antibodies selected mutate higher affinities. hand receptors typically recognize larger regions proteins varying affinities, function may may depend tightly receptor binds target. case, ACE2 entry receptor, meaning main necessity virus attach cell, may able happen lower affinity therefore protected mutation. Remember well mutations improve binding receptor seen variants like B.1.1.7 also impact antibody binding (though look like happened variant) sequence dependent receptor is.

Basically, answer complex process definitely cannot simplified ""spike can't mutate bind ACE2"" may unlikely, definitely possible. Got mine whim Walmart day. scheduled appointment anything. advertising intercom walk-ins available. there's people like like, know, I'm going keep wearing mask, much cold since 2019, pretty sweet. Tbh guilty hand coughing way old it. dad literally pandemic. many people know it. Maybe grew gross town 🤷‍♀️ 
but believe must least somewhat pervasive issue considering number PSAs got CDC. definitely know plenty people don’t know wash hands, isn’t fully related kind close phase 3 trials used short intervals wanted quicker results. used 3-month interval would delayed getting results two months. that's reason. Prior experience says longer intervals boosters gives stronger immunity.

The US decided national roll use interval used trial. thought conservative safe option. view obviously wrong time, medical people think. Depending vaccine used, 100% vaccinated means anywhere 5 30% still vulnerable infection. family fully vaccinated literally said exposed / highest risk around last year.  know soon enough vaccine works. one willing take responsibility it. There’s actual resistance idea, instead fighting resistance, they’re sitting hands. much beautocracy, much buck-passing, enough strong leadership, population literally superstitious push own.

It’s hugely disappointing. Japan supposed modern country. what’s surface? old shit they’ve always struggled with. Turns that’s bit theme us. one looks forward Teen Mom anymore. show went shit cast started getting control narrative. There's much trashy shit happening behind scenes one film about. Instead show stuff like bake sales business grand openings make cast look less shitty actually are. one wants watch bunch women got rich bad sex ed go expensive vacations 3 times year. want trash! There's literally reason watch show, sure hell educational.  Also promotes mask wearing. 50% adults stopped wearing masks vaccinated 50% would stop would spread hard among unvaccinated. argue ""thats get getting shot"" end day thats still peoples lives lost taxing put mask around people. 100% politicians don’t care. Unlike countries, Japan place they’d think letting anyone turn time - that’s far random. assign every person residency “ticket” individual name, organize time slot designated location, get vaccinated, probably registered system vaccinated, etc. imagine, quite feat takes time organize.

And there's decent chance process involve lot fax machines. Pedantry break. mortal coil refers struggles everyday life, something one inhabits. “shuffle mortal coil” throw burdens life one’s shoulders. CDC reported lowest daily count since last june 24,000 cases. One could say probably lowest actual number since pandemic started due lack reliable testing back june. also reported 280 deaths today lowest reported daily death total since pandemic started. Yes. people don’t show appointment pharmacy clinic post online vax available first come first serve. point mitigation stop transmission germs, bring R0 COVID 1.0. We’re signing 14 year old nephew *moment* gets approved, he’s dam excited haha.  sounds like hell earth. imagine sort bureaucracy immigrant someone opening company would subject to.  BC focusing hotspots vaccine administration. Average people 40 getting vaccinated yet exception parallel AZ pharmacy distribution system. Oh god it’s pain hear people. Especially it’s loud, they’re wearing mask, there’s plexiglass barrier.  ATMs closing bizarre. computer. would close night?? true.

70% 18+, country Coughing sneezing one’s hands gross. think always naturally elbow cough move. numbers death low random chance plays big role. can't effectively compare populations infection rates relate deaths they're low there's going much noise inherent randomness things like this. I've seen going around looks effect is. makes menstruate sooner heavier well. I'm ignoring it, read post. first bullet assuming we've missed *half* cases. Waivers aren’t legally admissible, they’re basically polygraphs court. me. wasn’t backlash. didn’t end coming you, find thread. 

I agree that’s it’s trust. 

When comes health teaching think need earn trust start giving information.

I think people likely believe politicians religious leaders assumed trust. people already share political religious beliefs. part tribe. 

Health teaching, done right, builds trust dispensing information. need receptive audience. believe scientific community assumed public would trust them, skipped critical steps.

I guess million dollar question “how build receptive audience?”

It may get answers Yeah, last time flu something similar ages ago. get food poisoning years ago, sucked. it’s seasonal allergies 🤧 mountain cedar starts acting up.  Nepal getting wrecked begging help. hope spare vaccines them. you’re bothered it, maybe eating you. Every survey vast majority eligible Americans wanting vax. sure data come vaccine like wearing fire proof jacket. protects well, still get burnt fire (covid) around. make sure safe, need many people possible get vaccine covid place continue spread. important everyone part get vaccine, stop spread make everyone safe possible. simple act help love everyone around you. got two DTP boosters month apart super-immune. mere presence eliminates tetanus room. refuse engage 'science' shows otherwise. That's one direction could go directions too, far know. You’re also ignoring asymptomatic never even got tested never reason to, even ones mild symptoms also didn’t get tested. know doesn’t fit “everyone’s gonna die” narrative you’re ignoring awful lot possibilities make point.  Maybe. knows? PM
Morrison said rush open borders one cabinet ministers said earliest second half 2022.

I wouldn’t think opening Australia office kind uncertainty. remember watching Big Short one Brad Pitt’s character’s quirks wearing mask airport (and giving knowing nod random Asian dude also wearing one). Simpler times lol One thing works large amounts Americans catchy advertising. tobacco industry knew many decades ago wanted appeal women. marketed smoking glamorous using celebrities worked. think people changed much. Could skilled advertisers admired celebrities recruited make getting vaccinated appeal large amounts people? letting perfect enemy good. I'm sure lots companies used legally need it.

Hopefully none industry size got juiced $500k free government grant compete you.

That decision might seem moral 5 years road closing shop, watch employees forced taking shitty jobs much-less-ethically-challenged competitors. Owning business easy, ethical concerns certainly nowhere near black white. 

In 20's said done exactly business did. Now, I'd call 20 year old naive stupid - I'd succeeded screwing employees making business highly uncompetitive.  there's nothing American that. Walgreens parts Japan. run differently USA. 6 foot rule magical barrier 6 feet 

It's better nothing, sure, still pretty much made number. virologist either.

""Leave scientists"" implies unified group scientist effectively one body agrees everything, all, infallible. person absolutely understanding science would come statement. what’s incentive healthy, specialized, people create drugs? comparison.

You're right. enough data 2 doses AZ yet

How that? UK mostly use AZ? push another year? There's literally still 3 years til worry next one... know BioNtech/Pfizer take early ""Development"" money, take money pre-order. $2 billion pre-order contract prevented US made vaccines sold anyone else US got order. Eventually yes, initial period shorter 4 week interval. fraction? 4/5ths US population gotten vaccine times one coffee shop store mask on.

That mind-boggling. Yeah not. It’s burden. cdc still recommends it. live house small children can’t vaccinated. There’s downside.   ""Could"". saying possibility see escape variant. is. Yall ridiculous Shit. variant strikes first, strikes hard, shows mercy. binding region ACE2 receptor spike protein much larger area specificity antibody binds to.

That makes lot sense, thank clarifying that! complexity / size ACE2 makes *better* target virus, perfect match whole RBD, enough 'stick'? Yep. I’m fairly big Texas city always high rate mask usage mandated still stores require it. You’re actually 8x generous Beyoncé. Ok, would vaccinated athletes entering country scare anyone? vaccinated also tested negative vaccine went reducing deaths ~90% reducing deaths ~55% (which would still ""prevent[ing] majority deaths"") would absolutely reason updated vaccine. would panic-button moment stretch imagination. 

My point is, fact, evidence reduced effectiveness. evidence reached point variant-specific booster necessary, part reason many people died everybody seems want sit around covering eyes virus smacks face, sort sloppy reporting contributes mindset. could start whole process comparison. enough data 2 doses AZ yet far #2 goes, that's vaccination handled California. followed link event Eventbrite, selected date, time slot, location, made agree show follow second shot different date. day vaccination took maybe 1 minute park, 2 minutes get shot, 15 minutes observation done. equal, though? point? 8 hour delay fetching comments.

Is 7-11 liberty make website cover 7-11? wait see... I’m sure public knows vaccines ready distributed &amp; protests looked upon japan you’re “going society”. People speak distrust government, won’t anything it. Japan incredible amount issues modernizing information infrastructure. still primarily rely fax machines paperwork information transfer, society mostly uses cash transactions. basically skipped internet revolution slowly trying move 21st century. 

The government somewhat recently announced major initiative attempt digitize nation's governments key institutions, multiple delays. going take time. Since like worshiping ""experts"", emergency physician exactly epidemologist specialist virology. opinion qualified local doctor. idea entails ""medical analyst"" TV channel. Another Canadian shting America internet. Get life! People aren’t getting vaccinated aren’t wearing masks anyway. They’ll keep us perpetual Covid cycle forever. use sweating much. Get vaccinated gently encourage others well - feel like make lot progress emphasizing it’s super easy get shot point, provide resources getting one scheduled. Won’t get everyone, helping apathetic, lazy otherwise oblivious types see it’s big deal get accomplished go long way.

Whatever do, don’t condescending approach. lot people spend hours upon hours day listening talk radio blowhards (or equivalent) intentionally stoke hate - “those smug others think tell look you” don’t feed shit. Sorry may forgot mention comment 75% efficacy asymptomatic infection specifically B.1.135 TBF, New South WALES bit confusing...🥺 Respect edit, people. 

We wouldnt want get gassed up. Lol ""I black friend"" worry much. demand dropped significantly US enough point ordered allow anyone wanting 2nd shot get anywhere else want to.

You trouble getting 2nd shot previous place anywhere else matter. Right, opened everyone April 12 here. last 3 weeks area outside Cincinnati, local healthcare networks along Kroger appointments available basically day. 

At point haven’t first shot, probably aren’t going to. Rokugan? tragedy caused Indian court bureaucrats, thousands people died one going take looking like might need get second Moderna shot two days early - 26 rather 28 days first. possible issues far anyone knows? earlier better later exactly 28 possible? Thanks advance. case count 459 today. know it’s usually lower weekend, it’s months since last day 1,000 reported cases state. Maybe going back last fall. time last year feeling nothing doom every day. feel like there’s least glimmer hope. good advice you’re right. It’s hard control. Ok event put anyone additional risk? athletes COVID free spectators. Japanese baseball league back since last June. different? Israel reported 8 new COVID cases yesterday. deaths, cases! Jeez can't wait US (hopefully) get \~60% population vaccinated like them. Slips falls catching illness two completely different things. prove slipped, fell got injured business. can’t prove got coronavirus business. did, it’s probably weren’t vaccinated, still doesn’t put burden proof business. You’re talking hypotheticals. vaccine protects you. you’re vaccinated get sick, it’s fault employer  work Disney don’t see letting us get rid masks time soon. Definitely month. deadline gave employees get vaccinated isn’t even September 30. Wording can, may be. Key wording may wording used Brazil, SA UK. Basically know say article need research. Yeah kinda see issue now, good  appear potential cross-reactivity instances effect spread pandemic far conclusive. many variables Asia handled virus restriction/public guidance standpoint conclude cross-reactive immunity anything stopping spread there. Also number people infected SARS MERS tiny compared Covid doubt would enough population immunity viruses make difference. People using argument India early look now.

This obviously studied future, think cross-reactive immunity playing big part controlling pandemic anywhere. Yeah I've already decided get COVID, I'm going crawl bed wait die. energy fight it. really look forward to? world ending climate catastrophe? collapse social security pension based retirement systems? Working die? Nah fam I'm gonna give fight get sick. I’m part 75% whose mental health impacted pandemic.

It improved. test asymptomatic infections, participants COV002 UK asked provide weekly self-administered nose throat swab NAAT testing 1 week first vaccination using kits provided UK Department Health Social Care (DHSC).

From lancet article cant link directly section unfortunately. sure Pfizer thing.  even READ original statement properly???

Vaccines work! NEVER STATED DON'T. Covid-19 vaccines EFFICACY rate percentage well work. COVID-19 VACCINE 100% EFFECTIVE. (That mean get ""doesn't work"". THAT'S SIMPLY TRUE, NEVER SAID THAT!)

GET VACCINE WEAR MASK WELL TRY STAY SAFE.

(I even wrote l w l seems idiots downvoted straight away CAN'T READ QUICKLY!) I’m wondering too. Didn’t say might able evade vaccines though? hmmm AZ higher effectiveness pfizer moderna? future? 😯 true. mask distance seen soul year, despite fully vaccinated. used home long books walks, good. Also retired takes stress off. Thats true, like european countries. However ICU never overcrowded, fact first wave french patients ICU Luxembourgers. partner got today (Pfizer) Quebec. Third wave seems slowing too. 

Good see overall. Hoping Montreal semi-normal summer. Politicians wanted low numbers person covid dies heart failure (caused covid) listed heart failure. 

Coincidentally Cities often pad violent crime stats. Unsolved crimes aren’t counted big number categories etc.  So, many patents vaccination taken away past? many patents taken away past? mean, say, result, that, must able show examples done, basic research started give profits.  Cowin?

It's bots looking slots.

But scaled really well last week. bot returns request immediately.  know anything vaccine efficacity waiting 3-4 months second dose like UK Canada? Home means home. Never heard 'loose' term think June restrictions vary heavily province. July depending many vaccinated can’t see majority country reopening. Probably pre-covid levels immediately, easily much less strict. state continues kick COVID's ass. 70 percent first-shot vaccination rate, less 1,000 cases entire weekend 1,000 cases per weekend day month half ago. vaccine works, cares. Billions people around world waiting vaccinated. Seems like countries well outliers. seems countries messed pandemic response regard they? feel like it’s one thing say don’t know anything possible, say evidence evade vaccines seems fairly explicit.

That said, really hope I’m wrong   Vaccines big help, certainty make people invulnerable. Companies forced take measures slip falls despite occuring infrequently.

Even get sick, medical expenses may involved, numbers going down, tracing good chance implemented track variants, well identifying infection may come from. Yah. Totally agree. Stupidity sides work service industry part hopes we'll able wear masks flu season. really enjoyed getting sick year due guest coughing me. Sorry, I've little jammed up! Here's past week's: 

Below view whether states supply constrained demand constrained. Based current run rate doses administered (7-day moving average state) available supply (doses delivered minus doses administered), calculate ""days supply"" proxy likely constraint. 

If 21 days supply, assume state demand constrained: state probably able effectively use doses. 

If 14 21 days supply, unclear whether state either demand constrained supply constrained (or bad logistics). 

if less 14 days supply, assume state supply constrained - doses, could probably get shots arms. 

Hawaii become supply constrained, mostly due inconsistent reporting doses causes 7-day rate ""pop"" data dump. view actually supply constrained. 

8 states became demand constrained (noted asterisk below): Rhode Island, Utah, Washington, Virginia, Maine, Oregon, Iowa, New Jersey, 

3 states moved ""supply constrained"" ""unclear"": Wisconsin, Minnesota, Massachusetts

While surprise anyone almost completely demand constrained, interesting see states growing above-normal excess supply. expect quality data decline coming weeks states telling Federal Government ""no more"" - doses hand begin better match demand time.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* amount people physically protesting Japan pretty big deal. Yeah jurisdiction has. BC, Canada. We've kept cases pretty low, basically sacrificed hospitality industry so. we've lots protocols businesses schools stay open.

I think trade good one. screw kids' development screw working families quit jobs put kids child care would crammed bunch kids anyways. least schools follow strict protocols keep transmission low. good keeping people alive long time give fighting chance. read even thought this. assumed everyone involved Olympics would required get vaccinated. Makes sense. Thank you! People keep repeating number source.

Reuters reports 28 million sources pfizer late 32 percent Mississippi’s population received dose vaccine. 

Obviously natural immunity thing, Britain Israel obviously lots Covid going around (e.g., lots natural immunity) didn’t turn corner much greater percentages population vaccinated.

Overall, I’m Covid optimist — highly doubt state outbreaks similar existed winter — think it’s silly think every state near herd immunity levels A0-3959X.91–15 experts around think would better argument besides manufacturer instructions said so. Less 100 cases county first time since 11/1.

Damn feels good. began there, one might argue original strain archetype SARS-CoV-2, variant. Wuhan strain may exact version one made initial zoonotic leap humans (as still know precise origins virus), one escalated things limited localized transmission global pandemic, context could seen OG SARS-CoV-2, thus variant. difficult time India stop propagandas, Govt ill prepared , kumbh crowded event happened recently Also generates tourism. major income source Japan. time, writing paper highway safety, there's reason would spend time studying impact proposal 12 year old drivers. let 12 year olds drive. certain point draw line consider lowest common denominator boundary conditions work, otherwise actual good research would simply get lost sea qualification, ass-covering useless minutiae. certain point, can't forming public health policy around people detached reality think retired tech entrepreneur wants inject 5G brain. 
 
Anyone reads work asks ""but impact ability 12 year olds drive?"" unceremoniously ignored. company mandate vaccines employees work there. vaccinated people highly, highly unlikely get serious COVID case also highly unlikely could sue business giving COVID burden proof flimsy. California, one website, myturncalifornia, checks local vaccine sites pharmacies availability. warm global climate change seem failed test species. Deaths lag cases weeks. weeks ago actually peak cases, getting peak deaths right now. Instead deaths flat, I'm guessing that's vaccine campaign targeted vulnerable first. start see drop deaths due drop cases shortly. Hold back, I'm get ""Purely Political""  mostly feel since I'm also fully vaccinated. I'll wear inside courtesy outdoor setting seem necessary fully vaccinated people. Though I'll wear place requires still.  state pretty much get vaccinated day almost anywhere. want pick vaccine, seems like Moderna hardest get. 

Most clinics shutting can't get enough people anymore. successful clinics giving away free items. glasses beer, amusement park tickets, joints.  noone? LMAO Right saying basically variants paywalled...but 25% relation what? We're going back fully normal. 

Mask mandates effectively everyone end May. Big events back September everywhere.

Things going well felt way you. Mostly due media bias heard Japan growing 90s 2000s. amazing cell phones video! crazy video games! Akihabara!

But actually visit Japan see truth. Yes great first world country. technological innovations. I've never seen country 1 step forward, 3 steps back Japan. 

The reliance cash, fax machines, stamps! Look hanko. get stamp register local office that's official signature. I've never lived I've told need register ward living get certificate ward left allowed move homes. Japanese apartment hunting process nightmare involves practically paying half years rent various deposits. enough time doses given it, compared 2 vaccines get valid enough data. remember correctly, started using late March, might wrong. thing even had, example, 50% vaccine skeptics (i made number) still leaves 50 million people *want* vaccine. Opening rush always going marked desperate people want vaccine most. IIRC, want know efficacy variant-targeting boosters people gotten Moderna-classic people previously vaccinated. kink-shame! wrong. Canadian provincial federal governments screwed handling pandemic. got lucky far continue mess things up.

Alberta currently worst hit spot look Canada US combined happened Michigan March/April definitely happen south again.  40-50% vaccine coverage isn’t going cut it. Right. single comment thread discussing Germany. Fine, one reply: you’re vaccine denier who’s living fantasy world government full control behavior people. real world benefit keeping mask restrictions place longer scientifically necessary — serve worsen prolong pandemic. Please stop killing many grandmas grandpas. Goodbye. Preliminary data AZ 100% effective 2 doses given later authorisation AZ UK’s 12 week dose interval study isn’t complete. Probably one Goodwill going want handle/buy used masks. little like donating underwear. individual thread Germany, commenting correct country. person incorrect one.   masks vaccinated people recommended... shots help breakthrough variants happen. It’s also vaccinated care people getting vaccinated. easy targets = chances breakthrough variants created.  missed part bar shots 1 day entire county entire week. fact German, France, Italy Netherlands formed alliance that. point though decided would order together a) show European solidarity b) smaller countries EU guilted dropping alliance .

It really turned failure epic proportions, months wasted valuable time really fundamental disagreements vaccines buy many. EU countries didn’t ability stop exports vaccines, ordered quickly get front line. 

And AstraZeneca problems exposed strategy fundamentally flawed. Kind like getting airplane crash anything breaks. EU late, ordered little mRNA first (ordered way later, way late) 

Germany knew going buy supply biontech/Pfizer Moderna, talked France January. Essentially putting EU broken boat. Today 4 weeks (Pfizer 3, Moderna 4 places like Walgreens made 4) opened up. Many getting second shot soon, everyone able get right away (possibly less issue places like Kentucky). Plus another 2 weeks they're fully covered.

But first dose numbers still climbing every single day climb even approved younger ages, gets full authorization.  cannot overstated inequal got see others homes via zoom pandemic people one room apartments getting see colleagues spacious homes, studios art, big backyards, multiple dogs/cats. priming Ad5-vectored vaccines followed inactivated vaccines, recombinant protein, mRNA vaccines significantly improved NAb response profile 

 results indicated “Ad5-vectored vaccine prime-mRNA vaccine boost” improve NAb levels effective “mRNA vaccine prime-Ad5vectored vaccine boost” regimen. It’s even worse job involves physical labor. Wearing mask 2 minutes gas station fine, really don’t want wear mask work anymore. feel you, completely agree. Also introvert able kinda hold till then. Even fall/winter tough manageable, I'm time low. Can't wait get second shot get out. myriad factors, understanding many countries main issue lack supply. severely little supply, also logistical challenges around ensure high priority people get it. modern industrialized nation paralyzed bureaucracy  bring fair points. get wrong, I'm assumption we're clear stated variants. listen science says, things change I'll act accordingly. I'm stay protected. worth, 2 year old back daycare since june we've two instances staying home. we're texas. Crazy.

If better idea whole world trying year now, I'm sure CDC would love hear it. then, guess shock awe. lmao rough day. Hit really sudden 16 hours shot felt like shit good 30 hours ended quickly started. agree! main reason cannot guideline stating vaccinated go without mask lack requirement/proof vaccination. 

Once hit higher level nationally (or state state) lifting mask mandates make sense. goal vaccinate literally everyone...current goal 60-70% population majority elderly. lot doable current rate. really surprisingly fast decline. know state (a leader vaccination rates) reporting lowest number hospilizations since know long- many many months. Cases deaths also lowpoint. definitely interesting, even bit discouraging. Haha. Though necessarily saying vaccine shot less effective creating antibody learned response, least proven. obviously still effective could lesser.  2016 Godzilla movie made fun satirized slow central government's bureaucracy general. Yeah start administering vaccine, 98% 36 hours. economic impact mean negative impact reintroducing covid country large numbers. Hi, suck. Thanks playing 🙃 one hand, people vaccinated = people vaccinated.

One hand, people going luxury cruises likely already access vaccines. fact Pfitzer/BioNTech (and research) says current vaccines work fine current variants interesting: could less profit-oriented? looking work image long run?

No real reason booster needed one other, based pre-fusion spike protein efficacy... Thank you! course. worried getting sick twice year, best place start flu shot. Lmao didn’t read got worked accident. people really special 😅Imagine 100s millions doses vaccine administered short time. Must fucking accident hahahaha  That’s relief. It’s years since I’ve gone Houston, I’m glad hear they’re staying somewhat responsible.

I honestly wouldn’t suspected Houston better masking practices DFW. EDIT: Japanese government regularly announces intent announce state emergency. Yes. famously announced Thursday Friday would announce State *Emergency begin Saturday. Seriously. actually happened. give insight glacial pace central government.*

So Shin Godzilla basically documentary? understand focusing first since pretty bad spot we're almost it. Kinda cool think US could get world leader important issue again. Exactly. Pfitzer mRNA could stable (because code 3'-UTR), could reason use ""only"" 30ug.  got lab coat goggles closet. Ready assist *""technical"" ""expertise""*. Ready lift ingredients secret sauce start cooking *gooood* stuff. asked sub months ago hospital capacity considered ""normal"" since articles reading leaving crucial detail. IIRC think consensus seemed normal capacity higher people would guess-- seem remember people giving numbers 70-90% range (if I'm totally off-base, sorry!). Basically, seeing numbers like 93% might seem alarming might reality-- especially due covid patients numbers hospital increasing. Literally nobody hoping decades lockdowns. covid nuts crazy. Event tho, Im weeb agree you. dont know talking about. like think animals Japanese translate ""moving objects"" English, composed 動(move)物(object) Nontheless, didnt write aggressively. Shining city hill. lot states' cases today less yesterday, according Worldometers. keeps up, less half cases last Monday. Considering ridiculously low chances breakthrough case, even lower chance spreading (0 far) fully vaccinated, right. documented outbreaks may skewing numbers? break 30k average there’s really telling relative last year, since May/June (which saw 15-30k averages) testing fraction size now. It’ll likely smallest spread since first shutdown. Sure- logic discussed all- yet are- including CDC. Since lack better means comparison might well use understand numbers approximations. Thanks study, that's interesting really great research. Seems research focuses nicotine vaping, however, vape THC extract really curious see similar research around it.

Regardless, great there's work done vaping whole, absolutely necessary gather information. Indeed. ARN exactly same, cf great post: 28% EU population least one dose, bit that. I'm surprised. Dad probably closer anti-vaxer vaccine hesitant think even turn doctor offered one right onus put refuse. would surprised much impact CDC guidance has. Impending doom two weeks away though! definitely help people keep posting sensationalist doomsday headlines literally every variant. burnt incase carrying covid. LOL. Thanks making laugh first time today.  already 40k. Let’s gooooooooooo way efficient ship vaccines.

Is it, though? many people reporting slow rollouts country's government frustration can't get myriad reasons there's dwindling interest U.S. means desire get vaccine. help? (Please note question sarcasm, genuine curiosity) Cough, ""enrollment period"", cough Never happier wrong I'd really like know too. What? It’s already used Emergency Use Authorization. Full approval detail process. need done TODAY? Vaccination ramping up. Let preface this: I'm say, recognize yet, I'm talking are.

It's ""gray area"" cant force masking others anymore.

It's gray, pretty black white. mandate gone, give shit wearing mask, give shit not. problem becomes people wearing masks start saying want everyone else wear masks (or select insane cases want everyone wear masks) around them. 

I hope masking public spaces bit longer, least see covid fall, recognize really much say others it.

So gray, control black white gets, gets complicated want compel masking others suddenly dealing free will.

Once we're past this, mask want to, mask don't. That's anyone do. J&amp;J vaccine figure in? count J&amp;J second dose first dose? think people die. personally got want lose sense smell/taste forever, would worse dying. problem across world, people handling national problem locally. know healthcare decentralized globally. IMO wealthy people inheritance 10's millions made way ensure system that's run inefficiently possible sake profit. efficient healthcare system would lower costs bad ""business"" pharmaceutical companies. 

this obsession decentralization needs stop. decentralization seen insurance dictatorships people seem apply parts government blindly. risks involved giving bad actor centralized control covid vaccine right every country distribution problems. centralized model would countries bad actors run falling behind vs situation today everybody falling behind. 12-24 hours start feeling symptoms, clear yet. time many experience all. Make sure hydrate, prepared worse case thee next day, enjoy immunity weeks.  would, much 18% fence right now. polling data this. wish CDC would come say they're recommending masks vaccinated people there's way differentiate vaccinated unvaccinated individuals public. Wow, would mean 47% people Alabama would COVID. Put process, 65% population would likely type immunity.

If number really high I'd expect see case rates crash never climb again. guess we'll see.  shitty literal literally put name website Minnesota organized everything me. states close? I'm getting second shot Wednesday live PA got shot NJ lol listen stop you. think encourage people travel US \*just\* get vaccinated. However someone happens US, vaccinating seems like mutual benefit.

If goal vaccinate countries, way efficient ship vaccines. right, evidence yet. remarking weird many people talking (the nurse gave second shot pretty confident going need booster) source people saying ""yeah something could necessary"" far tell research studies like second shot seem impact previously infected. talking total doses per day, India crushing you

If talking total people vaccinated, Israel crushing you

If talking vaccines administered per capita per day, Canada crushing you

I'm honestly quite sure metric trying push here. America best anything. 

Not say well, are. Keep good work America.  is, course, exactly indoor dining allowed rules masks exception carved out.

And *shouldn't* exception gym.

Having weird rules indoor dining ""works"" saving lot jobs. Taking mask work *not* save someone's job, thus there's reason allow it. Thank goodness. school messed big time last fall loopholes religious whatever. Get go school. Brilliant! Another big fat nail COVID’s coffin. One looking cool! animal studies showed 1st shot viral vector (e.g. AZ) 2nd shot mRNA gave stronger protection 2 shots vaccine, better 1st shot mRNA, 2nd shot viral vector. know vaccines 100% effective every current, future, mutation.

Nobody said ""100% effective"" - made head, random idiot reddit. there's plenty actual information effectiveness variants there.

Here's one example:

""Both Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna vaccines effectively prevent serious illness death variant, two independent studies one actually explain fireworks cause Covid outbreaks. Convince me, someone, anyone, dare you. plenty time get vaccinated then. would fear mongering gave scientific data driven explanation says. can't throw number deaths 300k reported, verified total without kind explanation. He's scientist right? Where's science data?

[Between March 1, 2020, January 2, 2021, United States experienced 2,801,439 deaths, 522,368 excess excess deaths around 550-580k (including time January now), get 900k?

The explanation think (and Fauci going say something like press conference sure would nice he'd give explanation) large number ""non-excess"" deaths caused Covid. example people statistically going die heart attack stroke actually died Covid instead. maybe 600k ""excess"" deaths 300k deaths caused Covid, adding 900k.

If case, next couple years see statistically lower deaths, essentially large group deaths front-loaded 2020 2021. That's exciting news! Originally estimated would take 12 18 months vaccine widely available, almost third U.S fully vaccinated, there's reason ""wait see"" happen. Getting vaccinated contagious, deadly virus far better contracting contagious, deadly virus. 

Personally think wrong put J&amp;J vaccine hold blood clots. medications cause blood clots nobody ever called banned questioned effectiveness medications altogether. reason people turn complete idiots vaccines concerned strangest thing me. little biased, though, since I'm several different medications moment, side effects could lead pretty bad outcomes me, hope I'm one lucky ones things go well for. box free donuts trick They’ll get vaccinated like hepatitis Vaccinated here...not wearing one. honestly problem pre covid, covid exasperated it. years we've yelling people side particular issue.

Fear mongering finest. Nearly half covid deaths occurred nursing homes, US normal conditions i.e. pre-covid 1000 deaths per day average person dies within 7-8 months. causes death sepsis, blood clots, stroke, etc. occur without covid. really say certainty deaths counted accurately? How?  Pfizer approved India another storage. Use following day?  could unblock exports, instead supporting patent waivers make short term difference supply issue. Sure among diseases I’m also pretty sure get vaccinated hepatitis A/B, get tetanus shot get checked accidentally punctured needle bitten. lack care now? sick stay home. mean sure. possible horror scenario might well ""There could NEW disease new pandemic international event like Olympics would perfect place spread entirely new disease around world!""

Seems likely. host NY. Olympics NYC 2021. reason countries slow rollouts lack supply US blocked exports.

And people means travel US.   question. kind explanation would nice.

I sure lot deaths early counted tests use dead.

But sure also happened someone died multiple conditions covid chosen even though cause, i.e. dying ""with"" covid vs. dying ""from"" covid.

How know real number? Using worldometers 400k. checking reasonableness, precision, rounded 500k since likely covid deaths USA recorded pre-February 2020. Even 100k cushion, total death tolls say 900k figure suggested article unreasonable inaccurate. talking like gonna bedridden lol.

There way know body deal it. people bedridden. Outdoor dining indoor dining sidewalk?

Only two households allowed meet outside, groups 6 less.

Also mind wearing mask. need medical professional able give injections? turning ad blocker, ever. states already lockdown, since March. Travel work restricted, offices shops closed, city either pass valid reason outside (getting vaccinated/medicine). 

If India go national lockdown, might create panic send laborers migrant workers back home, carrying virus corners country. That’s happened last time. honestly, Indians tired constant lockdown. second year virus people exhausted.  big step getting middle/high schoolers back classroom fall.  second dose joke. Got bed like 3 pm next day. prepared nothing day two I’m afraid enough never enough. standard seems changed risk-mitigation risk-elimination. original goal flattening curve allow hospitals prepare patients keep getting overwhelmed morphed growing sentiment one COVID death one many - fairly ridiculous stance hold infectious disease.

His standard seems vaccine 100% perfect every individual planet made completely perfect altruistic non profit Christian company never made drug ever caused problem person, ""an evil tree can't bring forth good fruit...""

If government made vaccine trust either Deep State.

If church made would wrong masons and/or Roman Catholics invaded church.

By lofty standards, way even live participate American society anymore, much less take counter drug big headache life seems be.

I kind done emailing back shooting down. pretty much lost respect critical thinking skills realize huge time suck years. Many years ago I’d fly ~100 segments year. Got sick vacation. That’s like 4 year period. I've obviously relying heavily people recognize sub I'm cheeky.

It's time repost old daily comment days. hasn’t. Like alleged harassment, it’s another smear campaign GOP start coup take New York sure went outpatient tests hospital last week, nobody could wear outside masks inside building. handed disposable blue surgical mask temperature check switch order enter building, keep left.  summer business holiday season Memorial Day - Labor Day United States. September 22nd Autumnal Equinox; however, Americans would consider mid June summer mid September even astronomical seasons aligned.  better worse, science work majority rule. people continue wear masks perpetuity

Not sure logically get ""this news article found people plan keep wearing masks"" ""mask mandates likely stick around"", OK... Certainly, important remember goes people's nervousness flight vs. driving number-crunching. ample psycho-social reasons disproportionate binary concerns persists.

One element loss control involved; flying may safer driving numerically, also involves willing surrender one's autonomy participate. Many people convince less likely get car accident they, personally, control vehicle -- least imagine reacting accident way would spared death serious injury; commercial jetliner another matter altogether, passengers meaningful control anything happens (except negatively -- always make situation worse, seldom better) reassuring options respond event accident.

Following that, people over-evaluate risks flying comparative aggregate severity accidents happen one mode transport vs. other. countless car accidents daily produce injuries whatsoever, say nothing people still manage survive otherwise. One hears comparatively commercial jetliner crashes everything turns fine, comparison; perception, least, fates determined plane crash, almost certainly going die process. perception (again, rightly wrongly) bolstered experiential factors; almost everyone drives involved least seen sort modest, trivial car accident, virtually nobody flies say jetliner. reassuring effect experienced there. Well rootie toot toot you, want cookie? Congrats 10 people got vaccinated talking vaccinated. Many say concerned side effects. try reassure big deal may side effects. can’t even begin compare last springs cases springs. Testing availability joke well summer last year morgues overfilled ? People dead side street? No? Quit worrying others do. Go get vaccine worry life. couldnt give two craps someone else’s health choice neither you. Whitest richest state what? coincidence I've lived NYC last years beer price gauge might slightly whack. Around even cheapest, shittiest draft beer like $7 Happy Hour. genuine travesty. eat fast live racially diverse city. Actually, I’m probably minority town I’m Caucasian.

Anyone walk get free vaccine right now. 

Is specific city state think persons color prevented obtaining vaccines? I’m really asking. I’ll find news articles post sub. tell difference rules designed public safety totalitarian regime.

And think totalitarian regimes justify draconian measures? Patriot Act NDAA 2012 sold? Vaccines forced they’re getting tested virus spreads unchecked. numbers already accurate due people getting tested. ridicule whoever want guess. can’t control that. I’d prefer left alone following rules. child adult? adult right exercise autonomy body choice result locked economy due concerted public-private campaign new identification systems. instead people choose get vaccinated talking hard drug users, alcoholics people engage extremely risky sexual practices would rightly appalled idea purposefully making harder participate society dangerous choice. yet are. true absolutely ridiculed they’re ones made every effort prolong thing first place. especially assbot Forgot game, got free psn years ago. really liked it. obsession business owners like need know actually plan open hire staff biggest labor shortage years. promise deliver ridiculously unfair strategy. Additionally, date going moved Boston add 3 additional weeks Governor say Thursday reexamine ""month so""? surely something would say planning align democratic states already open ""in month so"". Yep. live, small businesses starting take mask required signs (if ever required begin with). corporate chain businesses big box stores starting replace mask required signs mask suggested/recommended signs. Many places still mask required signs up, never enforced it, simply corporate requirement post signs. enforcing strictly. things changing. variants make testing harder.

And virus and, whatever reason, test negative infectious...

YOU INFECTING OTHERS.

Quarantine reduces exposure risk others. Unvaccinated people also aren’t getting daily / weekly / regular tests. That’s folks gotten stuck. don’t see situation cases don’t keep going except inevitable outbreaks death elderly pop. Well carefree, afforded opportunity take risks. Nobody carefree vaccine’s 100%. think ways intend read kind suck Alex jones also fucking moron gives shit thinks? Unvaccinated people provide hosts virus spread. infections = new variants. variants = higher chance one emerges evade immunity granted prior infection vaccination, putting entire planet back risk. yes, vaccinated people care unvaccinated people to. Israel stuck almost 60% long time. possible us get 70%? texas experiment means many places, including major cities, large kept safety guidelines place They’ll drop til start variants spread throughout unvaccinated population (who also unwilling get vaccinated) pick right back again. Hope we’ll see. He's selfish, beating around bush. get vaccine get people.

Thought 2 give everyone chance actually get vaccine wants stop masks? people throwing fits masks people gonna get vaccinated. know right? hate concept feel talking it, making people say what's point discouraging people getting vaccinated, turn would make endemic. whole might get less deadly thing, well, far
But there's difference around like flu, eradicated. There's always chance COVid reemerging animal populations, case vaccines would stomp quickly. Instead perpetually smoldering world think we'll stomping tiny fires pop up. major diseases eradicated, think smallpox was? also part daily life. pandemics fade less deadly versions. either vaccinate away ways treat (mainly bacterial like plague) Meaning weeks they’ll fully vaccinated opposed one dose right now. understanding viral load higher saliva higher viral load, likely contract severe covid. haven’t seen anything specifically viral load risk post-vaccine. Mostly, I’m trying figure current wisdom kissing people different vaccine statuses, science backs up. anyone know vaccine needle (at least Moderna) cause pain whatsoever inserted? I'm mad.

Good Connecticut, really happy obviously jealous.

**About Belgium Indian variant**

20 days ago, around 20th April, group Indian students Belgium identified cluster. Half approx. 40 students infected.

Problem is, lost track one infected students. know finally found reported authorities...


**About Belgium COVID19**

Big cities virus entry points : Antwerp, Brussels, Liège.

Once something new concerning COVID happens one cities, 100% guaranteed spread entire country.

Keep mind Belgium one cores EU. Belgians fail here, also impact whole West Europe.

It's movie, Belgian surrealism best. Yes, maybe something different forced act differently; panicked threw previous plans window, knows. pandemic preparedness plans available online: CDC, WHO, UK Government, etc. really isn’t “extraordinary claim”, said, previous pandemic plans public anyone see.

This UK Government say restrictions public gatherings preparedness plan influenza fatality rate 2.5% (similar Public limited evidence restrictions mass gatherings significant effect influenza virus transmission**14. Large public gatherings crowded events people may close proximity important indicator ‘normality’ may help maintain public morale pandemic. social economic consequences advising cancellation postponement large gatherings likely considerable event organisers, contributors participants. **There also lack scientific evidence impact internal travel restrictions transmission** attempts impose restrictions would wide-reaching implications business reasons, working presumption Government impose restrictions. emphasis instead encouraging symptoms follow advice stay home avoid spreading illness.

The CDC plans contain similar stuff. would be? Partly kids nearly always work shots portion childhood increase perception pain even physical stimulus change (it probably help kids often restrained need given multiple shots once. generally stressors kids vaccinated adults).

In case mRNA ones, could also additives vaccines help stimulate immune response make DTaP Hepatitis vaccines sting injection included, I'm expert vaccine additives seen recent information, maybe someone could help. covid-19 airborne, effective cloth masks preventing transmission? Thanks. would see dr. Either super rare side effects something else going medically. Either way, it’s worth getting checked out. think variants going stop, viruses definition famous mutating frequently. believe variants always make viruses harmful, sometimes make weaker.  thought SARS-CoV-2 could contained like SARS-CoV. 2 week lockdown identify outstanding cases would worked OG SARS, pre-symptomatic spread thing, people latched would *only* two week even proved would could contained way. I’m sure you’ve ever worked industry levels, top-to-bottom problem billionaires broke people alike haven’t solved. low-effort stereotype basing on? Newspapers TV stations America around world adapted digital economy simply pay people want free. Forgive skepticism solution readily apparent industry simply overrun lazy foolish. think US needs concentrate getting herd immunity first. Getting hesitant get vaccine big challenge. perfect world keep wearing masks extremely low burden vaccines 100% effective.

This exactly sort science denial reducing vaccine uptake rates among vaccine hesitant. USA Vaccination Demographics update 2021-05-09

So community transmission Indian variant Belgium low efficiency vaccines immunodeficient patients. 

Nothing earth shattering, covid restrictions elderly homes maintained even fully vaccinated populations you’re attempting impose rule kid fully vaccinated going away college can’t kids anyone unvaccinated? 

Honestly, that’s going fly period. fucking hate entire system. Truly hate it. things it. I'm going ground this. live Indiana remember that. Pence eventually caved needle exchange programs. Thankfully. work social/medical feel personally (and professionally) compelled care everyone. Especially worked hospital system. 

Okay stated, drug users STD carriers usually shit public. barred partaking ""risky behavior"" public. can't legally impaired, use drugs, fuck public venues. 

Jesus, unfortunately scenario, risky behavior literally includes breathing public. damn aerosol. fucking suuuuuucks. sucks, terrible risky behavior. stop breathing people homes much people privately getting zonked boned either, thankfully! thing. never extend people's homes. house fucking house. even pay taxes using land here. 

Now saying people's bodies choices are: let private/public entities decide do, let citizens decide do? 

Well that's kind shitty place be. trust either. 

What choices? want spread, droplet aerosols, stop prevent mass casualty? 

What worth doing?  Didn’t explain high mortality Spain/Italy fact, virus mortal south-/mediterranean people? That’s mentioned it. Still side effects. Left side chest swollen 11 days. Hopefully subsides soon. 👈👈 already know two breakthrough cases.

Vaccines immunity.  don’t think need mask mandates point. people want vaccines, gotten process US. ones don’t, often don’t mask anyway whether mandate not..I don’t see point throwing mandate now, especially states recently dropped mandates never mandates begin point game. Well, Hep transmitted feces(to oral)usually staff you. it’s got vaccine included childhood vaccine schedule lasts 25 years. So, yeah-I would hope wouldn’t eat too. Makes sense all. Vaccinated people shouldn’t made wear masks anywhere. send intelligence south please Brazil genes different U.S. 80% Brazil European genes. guess we're allowed say fat anymore? good reason this, want fear monger. 

So figure yourself. I’m worried private businesses going do. think lot going play safe covid completely eradicated avoid backlash. Especially cities. Bougon cried needle went arm. first dose Moderna vaccine hurt. because, finally, fat actually paid off.

A monumentally stupid line LA Times. 

A healthy unvaccinated person age healthier ( safer) obese vaccinated person.

The interesting thing pandemic that, obviously deadly, Covid-19 pales comparison risk obese oldest age groups semi-ironic watching morbidity obese person worry pulling mask back bites Big Mac. Maybe genes? articles this. nowadays probably better situation ever eridicate virus want to. staff? required vaxxed? Canada first country approve pfizer/biontech 12-15, based trial data (one conducted usa, sure trials countri s)



Seems like Israel waiting usa fda approve 16. Israel anticipated later October (6month Israel planning second round COVID-19 vaccination six months, point expects children approved health regulators receive jabs, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said 81% Israeli citizens residents 16 - age group eligible Pfizer (PFE.N) vaccine Israel - received doses one world's fastest said plans administer vaccines 12- 15-year-olds upon approval U.S. Food Drug Administration (FDA). Pfizer partner BioNTech (22UAy.DE) requested emergency FDA authorisation earlier month use age group. read 70% *all* adults, high-risk groups.

There threat hospitals anymore. Well Spokane 100th largest metro area country large population centers Tri Cities Yakima, (the Palm Springs Washington).

Also much state vast desert Palouse, many trees. 

What shocking King County, (where Seattle is) 50% well. mean talking virus 99.8% survival rate...its exactly Hemorrhagic Fever. think Darwin wait next one. think it’s accepted long ago Covid never eradicated.

I disagree. That's quite extraordinary claim. virtually every public health expert decided early pandemic throw plans window? Oh interesting! Thank you. makes feel better AZ You’re looking wrong number. article refers percent eligible population 16 least one dose CT. Arizona 52.9%, quite bad. 42% percentage Arizona residents including children can’t get yet. Already seeing people tiktok talking cdc risky Fauci saying masks indoors relaxed... hundreds millions figure transition new industry instead chose destroy inside out. ways make money even free content decided keep old outdated model. right, mistake. Things promising thought. [Possibly next younger kids fall. Can’t wait it’s approved toddler! She’s one family vaccinated. Oh actually didn’t get meningitis vaccine college. objected anything, “recommended required” didn’t bother scheduling appointment already pretty busy. Looking back wish required would done it. Kids need push right thing sometimes.  &lt;3

Remindme! 6 months kidding RIP Republicans probably knee jerk reaction hearing say mask policies need get conservative. Conservatives: God dammit, liberals!

Jk, great news, good things seem trending towards positive outcome. Depressants depress immune system. like alcohol directly quickly affects brain, also affects functions regulated brain neurotransmitters reduced reaction speed, sensorimotor functions immune reactivity. new information, known depressants (and converse stimulants) several years. think epinephrine shots work quickly allergic reactions? I'm sort skeptical we're going need 70% fully vax. bet 60% adults + kids 16 enough (given USA's large amount folks got originally) Yes approve 12-15, approve 6 mo-15 end year. Plus, probably eke another good bit next 6 mo effectively zero reported cases serious adverse outcomes vaccines. many instances serious negative outcomes children catching Covid, including death. can’t see wouldn’t vaccinate young children. 7 year old 3 year old full prepared vaccinate fully prepared hold indoor non masked activities indefinitely vaccinated. You’re free make decisions regarding children parent. 

But chance death grade school age child covid-19 one million (I link official estimate). many activities far dangerous young children risk covid car.

If want keep children home away indoor places without masks mandates lifted, totally choice respect that. 

However, can’t keep restrictions place everyone else based certain parents’ risk calculus’s. sucks ""Indian government blown smithereens nuclear word blast; survivors"" still leaving. high taxes 30+ years failure worth it. 

The East Coast also holds inequality segregation. joke. 100% sure right, OP wrong going backfire worst ways. it’s pronounced Cornell it’s highest rank Ivy League!  Yes, think it'll matter much US point since large majority vaccinated Pfizer Moderna. also keep mind Johnson Johnson, AstraZeneca/Covishield Chinese vaccines effective preventing infection, still provide near 100% protection getting hospitalized dying COVID-19. Also could beneficial vaccinate fell 'experimental vaccine' propaganda, still completely vaccines. south carolina need move focus super rural majority black counties. rural majority white counties likely going want vaccine even available, black counties massively underserved healthcare system. dialing 1-800-232-0233 phone, people search vaccine opt talk call center representative provide information locations offer shots. Assistance provided English, Spanish many additional languages. addition, there's TTY line callers hearing impaired. “Written local point view” would include mention fact two nearby states also belong small group. didn’t say detailed report states, fact VT also 70% absolutely local information that’s relevant people CT, even short article weird omission. like profit requirement silly. also swiftly address emergent problems scaling money hand due requirement, run around asking rather dealing immediately.  Worldometers reporting 22000 cases US right now. holds another hour, that’ll lowest result essentially year US really needs mental health federal law supersedes state therapy licensing restrictions arbitrary insurance limits, regarding Teletherapy. states excess therapists few. logic person WV able get online telephonic therapy provider NY. Honestly, back four days, even I’d known would go it. Don’t want get sick don’t want get people sick.  Florida pretty average every step way according you. Considering much state depends tourism, time people travel, come middle pack almost every regard pretty impressive. 

Also Florida 7th states people moved 2020. yeah, they're fine metric. not. Covid 19 infection risk nowhere near ""negligible"" current levels even vaccinated outdoor spread absolutely happens appreciable rate reasonable mechanism spread reduced masks. Washington State? odd percentage even 100 people anywhere outside cities. trees outside like...Seattle? Right, least believe kind personification like normal religion, damn you! proud overweight unhealthy mind blowing me. would think something scary threat dying new disease would motivate try lose weight guess not. According every pandemic preparedness plan COVID, science-based public health measures much closer states anyone else. getting exported soon. ban me. don’t care. never visit dumpster fire exactly reason. nothing wrong comment, damn sure reason comment removed many others actually spreading misinformation. Hope great Mother’s Day Jennifer. sure, anything limits disease likely going lower viral loads hence transmission.

Sterilizing immunity always hope though. amazing new vaccines seeming give high degree well, especially since hitting magic 70% vaccinated looks hard do. A. may side effects
B. are, they’ll likely mild
C. it’s not, it’ll go away within days right, upvote. first death Indian variant, shit gonna real...  fundemental.

This Reddit. Israel way people 16 US does. Much higher birthrate us   problem asymptomatic spread, know much anything virus, especially beginning. pandemic playbook put us gov lists social distancing cancellation large gatherings important tools, several studies back up. Oh well, basically past us now. live crowded urban center everyone know followed CDC guidelines one got - I'm thankful that, can't help thinking could spared lot headache people taken seriously. Wearing mask even don’t strictly need to…harms nobody. don’t personally see helps children. Maybe area different 90% kids aren’t wearing masks store anyway even parents are. kid higher risk, probably shouldn’t store period. parents fully vaxxed, matters ? Yeah, we're weird state too. us vaccinated, 2yo obviously isn't. bad outcomes age low, still. might go restaurant even vaccinated community transmission low point. 

The silver lining is, may gone many restaurants age anyway! much easier sleepy infant rambunctious toddler. would good idea theory, believe would negative social pressure associated would cause people avoid it. Whenever pandemic passed, wearing mask public likely going associated sick, going cause people treat someone like they’ve got plague despite fact trying responsible. Karens start approaching berating leaving house, start avoiding masks due social stigma. Worrying COVID you’re literally killing gluttony. May 19 except masks public places  Wow that’s crazy! elementary child back full time year middle schoolers hybrid back full time since March. northeast. Hope kids get back soon m, would thought Texas would back school! I'm point inside larger stores might crowded places matter politeness place wear mine figure start weening inevitable announcement ditch

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* don’t know sure point, seems case. Im pretty sure doctor CDC said much got chastised isn’t definitive proof. broken clock sorting controversial way. simple explanation probably people complain going backwards never reaching goal. could avoided making goal based total pop.. want fear monger. 

and proceed fear monger Sure, assumptions wrong many cases. I'm explaining I'd assume that. Like said, I'm someone go bother someone wearing wearing mask. leave people alone. appreciate consistent posts. Post-covid- know sick (flu/cold/whatever) need go yeah, see voluntarily wearing mask. easy sign, ""hey person sick, avoid"" Otherwise, nah. varients named countries originated? Whereas original virus originated China nobody even dares mention days. MS sucks man hope alright Again, social norms inform laws adopted laws inform social norms acceptable.

To highlight this, consider history seat belt usage United States. law required seat belts installed vehicles United States 1961, Wisconsin. take long? Well, socially, used often, even vehicle manufacturers install them. time (through 40s, 50s, 60s), became common vehicle manufacturers include seat belts people actually use them.

Social norms inform laws adopted.

Today, seat belts uncontroversial. required included every vehicle produced United States. Every jurisdiction requires usage seat belts. required long, become uncontroversial widely accepted.

Laws inform social norms mean I’ve wearing work 8 hours day year barely feel point. Done what? Ok, assumption would wrong many cases. assholes immunocompromised new narcissism. Well *I'M* vaccinated. 500,000 Michiganders ages 12 15, likely half get first dose May. none count towards hitting reopening metric. Whitmer provided explanation far tell. set date set percentage vaccinated? don’t think “seasonal masks” thing following pandemic, think many countries adopt many Asian countries do: feeling sick wear mask going public reduce spread. look would def help flu season science accurate source get from. Seasonality probably speeding process, 67% vaccination rate, plus natural immunity really bad surge last spring, lot heavy lifting. Safeway barber shop closed 3 times due contact tracing covid positive results customers. It’s known thing town. ended restrictions tomorrow, shop reputation would kind spiral Down. sure I’m going back again. Children can’t get vaccinated. mandates justified need protect children. position nuanced. advocated wearing masks vaccines 100% effective. effective many vaccines past century. another vein, seatbelts way, way less effective preventing death injury crashes vaccine preventing death covid. ban travel 25 mph perhaps cars altogether?

In way life exercise risk management. Every decision make sort risk calculation attached it, consciously unconsciously. gross overestimation risk covid vaccinated individual harmful people gross overestimation risks associated getting vaccine. anti-vaxxers, people legitimately fence lying decrease risk getting vaccinated potential return normalcy causes make wrong decision. People suck concept risk don’t understand evaluate use evaluation shape behavior. It’s easier follow tribe there’s way “guarantee you’re right things.” Dumb, help push group get vaccinated, pretty much expected.. focus death. Nothing done entire pandemic fear immediate family would die Covid. locking behavioral changes concerns long term effects. recent data links Covid diabetes concerning, example. 98 99 hundred people tested, test negative. sickness instead covid? Hawaii yet. difficult get vaccines shipped here, recently opened vaccinations whole public. getting though! Yeah ummm that’s going happen. people may like wearing masks; population large hates (albeit may think necessary pandemic). I’m Texas remote year plans go back year. According latest plan, back next August F2F, opening another virtual school, jic parents don’t want send kids back.

ETA: can’t wait. Virtual school awful. don’t get negative test go get vaccinated that’s youre getting at. There’s data showing it’s “dangerous” get vaccinated Covid it’s less effective.

If specific reason believe Covid, ie know may exposed, go get tested find out. Ideally don’t want spreading virus people vaccinating you. Although chances good people vaccinated themselves. long long enough? 3 years? 5? every unvaccinated person risk new variant could breakthrough current vaccines. 

We live society means things greater good, one situations. Natural immunity sort lie like tell ourselves. Denmark study shows often infection result immunity.

Further, Brazil highlights risk dual Covid-19 infections.

People zero covid strategies really supported messaging received important protect other. paid, given additional leave, often reported feeling better pandemic lives improved.

The title implies people afraid fear reduced risk taking absolutely still factor title article implying zero covid strategy folks somehow less normal are.

They aren't. maskless concerts restaurant dining us. It’s saddening see throughout pandemic incompetent ineffective bureaucracy.

On side note he's got really good taste cars.  media twisting around words — again. Biden recently said might able relax indoor mask wearing vaccinated soon. media looking clicks. suggest give articles attention, period. discourage you. already posted Reposts removed. Get close we're going get herd immunity, limit creating new variants, allow us open everything. could done last year, people assholes. far everyone predicted governor would lift restrictions wrong, he’s bit slower like (which mostly ‘’anytime March 21, 2020”). expect thing case CDC.  You’re lucky. live Florida I’m lucky see half people public masking properly. Kids almost never masks on. 100% protection severe symptoms. numbers rationale still backed science. point NEVER eradicate virus. good point.

Maybe fall I'll feel comfortable based local case rates.

...but 100% agree regarding vaccinated, ""that's you."" (The legit reasons notwithstanding) still said. I’m little adventurous terms venues go  months restrictions vaccinated people going solve exactly? prove theory need work disprove it, prove it, otherwise falling trap pseudo science confirmation bias.

Systematic racism exists, calling there's evidence it, like regarding post, hurts cause helps it. trains people easily disregard idea always giving unfounded examples it. Oh shit Yes, people feel ashamed weight seriously unhealthy. So, trusts scientists. yet saying wear masks. Good news vaccines work. fully vaccinated wife one week away. Next weekend going go eat favorite place. unvaccinated customers us that's problem. alcohol thing less right? We've already got people acting like drugs big deal. marijuana, even hard drugs normalized more. know what's narcissism? Stunting development kids another year starving person social interaction protect immunocompromised.

Life needs move on. Deaths continue happen albeit minor lefvel. vaccine significantly cut risk covid across board. point never eradicate virus hope done enough protect majority at-risk people (which have). Science pretty much never definitive. That’s makes science That's fair. problem Fauci, I've trusted intentions whole time. definitely predicts advises extremely conservatively, someone position (although think messaging could've handled better several instances). Sorry. I'm unhappy feel like public health messaging counterproductive.

They miracle vaccines beg people take them, make sound like they're useless.   Many took five minutes learn something someone themselves. That's what. think China well relies mostly NPI think vaccine programs isnt fast like Americans get vaccinated. actually pretty funny word word sentence Trump erroneously fed us like 50 different times last year, every week since March ""turning corner"". nice see actually reflecting reality first time. got first Moderna Thursday. Friday evening low grade fever, chills, headache, sore arm, body ache appetite. Friday afternoon fever gone rest symptoms day. Saturday slight sore arm headache. Finally today feel back myself. I'm 32 year old female health conditions, normal bmi medications. rarely get sick. 2nd dose lol!! work mask well everybody else gym. I'm US nobody complains it. really big deal, like forced wear N95 mask. Almost everyone wears surgical mask cloth mask allow enough air breathe easily. course would rather wear mask simple way preventing virus spreading. Immunocompromised people get vaccine. work. get 70% take masks. then, compassion. That’s kind depressing honest. originally claimed can't separate individuals companies employ inventors patents. I've shown untrue. one Moderna see, Moderna applicant assignee patent. So, back original point, privilege lives rights individual humans ""lives"" rights legal entities like corporations. public interest protect patent holders encourage innovation, case need vaccinate people quickly possible save lives mitigate potential emergence variants evade current vaccines takes precedence. would believe even patents held ""Mr. Moderna"" ""Ms. Pfizer"" (or inventors listed patents) ""individuals"" manufacturing vaccine basements. like (the companies) compensated every vaccine vial produce.

Like said, we're going agree disagree one. wearing safety wearing then? individuals trials weren’t asked avoid exercise there’s reason think lower effectiveness. said, prepared side effects listen body; feel like crap, don’t work out. feel okay, it’s likely fine work cautiously make sure stay hydrated stop start feeling worse! Seriously, wrong person. remember said made several posts fucking mind saying stuff like damaging messaging current situation, got downvoted hard it. honestly fired least put heavy restrictions tell people, terrible BS. None numbers indicating that, logic indicating that, few/no experts agreed either. understand herd immunity?

We need 70-85%, 100%. Let immunocompromised people either wear mask part 30% get vaccine/isn't protected. Gottlieb luxury official, actually make predictions. Fauci probably thinking exact thing, can't say exactly time safe. already posted Reposts removed. Yeah people like made totally clear throughout. you.

Btw, stats info way off, expect care enough learn. Seems like good outlook life. wish best Sinovac/coronavac. Brazil, people want one, side effects minimum. I’ve vaccine. want characterize question throwing fit, incorrect. sub littered misinformation ignored data suggests less restrictions. Fear goal it’s working. longer resilient society. Short answer- yes, new normal. 

And be? Colleges want kids campus kids least likely follow guidelines don’t think anyone thread knows hell you’re going likely he's specifying 70% rather 55-60% Vaccination Demographics update 2021-05-09

It's simple prevention measure.

Oh no, mask mandates stick around 3-6 months longer people wanted. getting harmed place? 65+ killing vulnerable, love see it. school conveniently offered meningitis shot administration building freshman orientation. liberal? make conservative sub mask spite. Legit question, break many types fabrics, types, etc you’ve tried exactly causing difficulty. even trying dick, I’m genuinely curious 14 months locked following, first I’ve seen comment regarding this. sounds like saying reason people wear masks.

But there's going readjustment period us pandemic over. There's need expect everything 2019 overnight even logically be. 🇨🇳  logic, might well never drive seat belts 100% effective, there's chance could crash someone else. Sure, feel free stay home, want wear seat belt, drive attentively, take small risk car crash, please try stop me. feel like gets foreshadowed happens almost immediately after. guessing maybe time next week. That's actually hilarious

College 100% alcoholics according CDC  Nope - doesn’t infect them. There’s handful positive tests zero reported cases transmission. were, would know. millions human cases, would certain. 

Cats different. Big cats too. positive tests take NyQuil help second shot symptoms? 3-year-old can't go daycare next week covid exposure caused classroom close 10 days. Third closure 2021. newborn home worry well. I'm whole thing. This.

If cannot prove vaccinated, assume _no one_ is.

I'm vaccinated. two weeks past 2nd shot. still go indoor dining, truly know fellow diners vaccinated not. Russian Bots bot. would Biden announcing it? CDC would change guidance soon data show safe. arent gonna hold sync presidents goal. Biden gotten ahead CDC yet, think would now. would make seem political.  That’s entirely possible, may reason. wasn’t said originally replied to. 

You said may included information local website big paper, point fact local makes likely anything would included states CT. I've yet hear country making vaccines mandatory. New Zealand we're getting Pfizer, guess society whole decide whether reach herd immunity not. plan open countries almost zero cases first, start next year. Inevitably infected people arrive (even testing vaccinated) minor outbreaks. likely spur stragglers getting vaccinated country opens vaccinated people higher risk countries (1-4 months later??). boosters aimed new variants, guess depends fast Pfizer starts making them. idea non-vaccinated people allowed arrive. don’t think variants form unchecked spread virus? “considering” changing mask guidance, won’t relax months think, CDC moves slowly  First all, indoor masking doesn’t “eliminate” risk children anyone, masks 100% effective. even masking still technically risk unvaccinated person get covid. 

We’re going agree, risk low especially adults vaccinated cases plummeting, become individual choice. Everything life risk, risk dying bad case covid becomes par risks diseases like flu (which vaccinated adults children 12), there’s justification population level restrictions still place even it’s “minor inconvenience.” Dude... really? You’re vaccinated, you’re fine. Live life, man. make sense keep mask people want get vaccinated.

It make sense either. valid arguments side - variants, children immunocompromised people main ones, I'm sure see used read sub much. personally find compelling enough change view it. Actually think variants one even valid argument. remember story dogs it, least I’m pretty sure. become one first states, either first not. Period. important. hid numbers Trump’s DOJ wasting time sneaking around issue. best thing could cover Trump couldn’t keep anti-mask agenda. Since Biden won, Cuomo saved millions lives. We've getting ""be patient"" bullshit year half. 

Even 10 million people, that's like 3 percent. worth holding country hostage tell police laws lawmakers' problem? know someone taken money made past 3 years loan forgiven. guy got caught, I’d imagine people getting away getting caught. Exactly. lot mask debate comes thinks like restaurant rules. scientist know rules theater say ""doing something"".  It’s often open Reddit see one college hangouts image NYT article. Oh disagree, TBH, probably would circumstances. ""No one"" relatively minor respiratory conditions (colds normal typical seasonal flu). wonder might be? anti-passport selfish chucklefucks started forging vaccination cards. 
 
I changed mind. Bring vaccine passports.  would thought would played Plague Inc. push back 6 months year?  Interesting, thanks perspective. I'd say actually plausible initially sounds, considering none east Asian countries recorded outbreak even near scale Europe Americas - could well genetic factor affecting transmission dynamics. Incorrect. Kids get dozens shots part vaccine regimen Japan. government tells people eat raw cookie dough well. use one put CDC guidance context. Yes, say science-based, also assumes extreme degree risk aversion. casual search, [pfizer vaccine seem top 1ml.

Moderna trials younger kids. Iirc, 6 months old. sports possible audience. people watch home athletes certainly don’t want push till 2024.  approved FDA, get immediately? Happened Australia too. Thankfully adverse reactions &amp; old mates took like champ    vaccine vaccine.

You going need show work one bro. percentage currently covid?   EUA expected week. Pediatrician's offices ramping preparation. I'm sure soon.  Dibs ""Cautious Hugging"" potential band name.  also think even practical, travel bubbles logically amount long term quarantining poor parts world resources infrastructure fully vaccinate near-term time frame. 

If Australia going take years, long Bangladesh? sub-Saharan Africa? Covid likely endemic world now, even sufficient vaccination herd immunity, countries keep current measures forever? 

Border closures proven good short term solutions, country accidentally locks never able justify lifting think that's bit failure right. false! Please edit remove comment misinformation spread. Thats keeping idiot safe. keeping innocent bystanders safe. respect you. seem remember half people got Covid never even symptom  aren’t really getting lot benefits vaccine kids aren’t vaccinated. aren’t going take restaurant, example.

That’s group studied though. multiple studies finding similar rates long Covid minor cases hospitalized cases.  suspect won’t see another increase approve new age group. Hopefully 12-15 approval happens week.  base sweeping societal restrictions flu level risk children ill join damn protests Refusing wear mask ignoring science became political statement, people refusing take mask ignoring science make political statement too. Risk groups offered vaccination 19th May France administered 4M doses today. neighboring countries opened outdoor restaurants too. I’d say timing makes sense. Obviously keep little longer  Correct, covid months ago city’s health department directed quarantine 10 days. What's getting feeling trust vaccine got works act like it, else get it?

Everyone process need tie timing anyone else's. Yesterday friends seen long time fully vaccinated little weird feeling shaking hands, hugging, wearing masks, etc. like used do. However, imagine time see get normal again. 

It's ok, also vaccines 100% effective also ok nagging doubts on. However, think need pay attention numbers cases fallen cliff lately U.S. Also remember vaccines effective preventing getting COVID, even small number cases vaccinated person gets it, immune systems better able handle vaccine. study recently, money tended work better Democrats, Republicans needed one-on-one talks people trust. NY got first mid March 17 time. Crazy see vacation going countries. 58% adults least one dose? everyone saying 70% going difficult July 4th? Like 8 weeks away, sounds easy enough. worth bruises get ring. And? Vaccinations going well, point live Athletes required actually agree points here, really see solution advocating. three points going realistically case rest lives, certainly many, many years, New Zealand genuinely going close indefinitely? needs better long term solution IMO. That's never going happen worth considering get vaccinated keep wearing god damn mask another year? six separate doses. One large dose equivalent 6 regular doses.

Had six separate doses spread think would much interesting see effects.  Good.

I also see AZ failing win lot contracts EU countries coming years. IIRC Pfizer requested far, schedule approved now, submitted emergency use authorization, like current authorization adults.

Full FDA approval still likely months away. everyone, people, especially younger people seem extremely sick next day. know least ten people got every single one extremely sick (including me)

Its weird rarely see vaccines. Im sure side effects nearly scale see covid vaccine something isn’t big deal you, zero bearing people’s enjoyment something

This goddamn narrative shift “this thing doesn’t bother everyone else feel same” insanely self centered well travelled long way india.. slept hotels dorms ... open air bath isnt really problem Let’s hope isn’t time traveler XD Dropping tip need anything that.

Taxes pay otherwise would easily show committed fraud wearing mask restaurant door table, taking eat talk confined space, putting back walk door?

Some rules really stupid. expert virology, mean *just* listen him. know combat pandemic, shut everybody doors problem gone right?

People experts field, also totally incapable deciding handle pandemic weigh aspects matter people, preventing virus.

This much social, mental economic crisis health crisis. call anti science consider one part pie. 
On hold sense? dick can’t go pub sniff line mask.? Honestly people hilarious me. masks, stuff too. go gym get haircut, make answer questionnaire (have sick last days, exposed someone Covid, traveled state) take temperature. go supermarket, Home Depot, etc., stores way customers inside, stuff. kids go school make huge deal sanitizing desks everything else classes. local park still making big deal 6 feet distancing OUTSIDE.

Even half population vaccinated that’s still huge advantage we’ve been. isn’t on/off switch hit “herd immunity” levels covid ceases exist don’t hit start whole cycle again. likely land somewhere middle see another rise cases among unvaccinated people population still well protected. got vaccinated last Thursday thing sore arm. Maybe bit overstated could definitely still major issues. doubt actually meant we'd back literal square one, could mean another year fear inability maintain ""normal"" long. US cases need keep dropping literally go away entire endeavor truly worked. Also uncharted waters long vaccines last fading protection idea variant booster rollout considering world can't get jabbed even over. “Zero risk” didnt Florida report 10k nee variant cases yesterday? I’m getting pretty tired sorts comments. Thankfully sensible people stick guidelines allowed us move pandemic, we’d let “it fine” crew run show we’d end like India clear 72 hours, need get tested. could've exposed time shots. really really hope slow reporting. rest world desperate vaccines! Keep mandate? Like masks forever? That's nuts definitely check out! Thanks! point it’s literally enough? “Zero risk” seems pretty confident.  swab irritating sinus tissue. clear up. way, sinusitis often referred ""sinus infection"" actual infection. inability thickened mucus clear sinus cavities. Mucinex water best friends--and sinus lavage something need discover. decades believing susceptible repeat sinus infections, began healthy regimen sinus lavage morning, Mucinex morning night, drinking ton water thin mucus-- I've sinusitis free 20 years. Kewl dude totally understand sentiment, they're paper/disposable, consider giving goodwill something instead. know downvoted.....it's completely true depressing lol. “Let buy stuff I’m desperate buy stuff, won’t wear mask”. Consumerism essentially cult point. People willing risk death buy stuff Even using weakest vaccine basis. would 33% chance giving extra protection.

You still need actually encounter virus, prevalence decreases becomes less likely, addition COVID transmission perfect, even encountering someone COVID guarantee catching it.

Finally, risk factor individual. 20 something instance low risk hospitalisation begin etc. Supposedly yes, given timelines under-50s extend late end year

Saying could “start again” like vaccines nothing fear mongering language definitely won’t help convince hesitant people get vaccinated. would get vaccinated experts say won’t even help?  narrow mindset. Trumpian... difference USA could afford Trump, countries means decline. could well see another rise cases fall enough people don’t get vaccinated. That’s she’s saying though, she’s saying thinks we’re going “start again” accurate all. There’s minuscule chance see numbers like saw fall/winter again, even half population vaccinated that’s huge advantage we’ve before. Thank you. got vaccinated today :) know, even one stuff, wasn’t vaccinated. vaccinated elder still die new variant, wouldn’t vaccinated non-risk group person spread it? yes, someone explain they're slow? Masks never mandatory outside unless maintaining 6 feet wasn’t possible. words never really mandatory outside half people never wore since beginning. 72 million doses Biontech sitting warehouses. It’s fault. virus airborne little relation stopping air travel (even disease spread contact incredibly efficiently, stopping travel might necessary). still may mistake recommend stopping, weighing scientific evidence time. Even wrong, considered crime, unless something clearly fraudulent it, fact novel disease acting novel ways fast judgment calls limited data needed.

Seriously, better manage calm down. future, issues global pandemic governance fixed, become activist that: fund properly, fund national CDCs properly, get heads state involved quicker... Finding individuals blame list, however. Agreed, it’s going bummer work asks us come back open office two year old infant vaccinated. Feels kinda like social pressure saying “adults good, let’s go back normal!”

I wonder daughter’s generation blame us long lasting complications disease don’t know yet, pulled trigger go back normal early? call covid kids? 10000 variants florida would like word you.

Furthermore wanted organise rave private property (stating police couldnt anything). leader also son big landlord reason couldnfinance career dance teacher ""public spokesman"" said rather. write experts quotation marks?

Breaking rules typically frowned upon Singapore. love rules. That's better people giving nasty stares wearing masks Yes, someone who's desperate see parents overseas still risk it. rocker think frequent closing travel bubble (which inevitable) major impact travel business leisure purposes. Yeah

Coming saying ""once done waiting period full vaccination that's it, put away mask want"" would increase uptake lot. Calling someone else ""delusional"" incivil? think Covid going away? side coin millions millions lives put hold demolished covid restrictions/precautions. Businesses closed, lives livelihoods ruined, major life events entire futures ruined, hold, demolished. Don’t forget people early kid theories hit major financial disasters. could saying thing “can’t everyone deal lives aren’t destroyed?” matter happens doesn’t happen, people gravely affected. linked article really cut quote. said think so. think going probably see go along people get vaccinated, CDC almost real time [be] updating recommendations guidelines. yes, need start liberal get people vaccinated. get people vaccinated, number cases per day absolutely go down. We're averaging 43,000 day. We've got get much, much lower that. gets lower, risk infection, indoor outdoor diminishes dramatically

He make estimate happen even say much drop daily case numbers considered ""much much lower"". Cases dropping pretty rapidly, imagine still month change mask guidelines. want come country next year? Fast approaching hermits speed vaccine rollout NZ Australia. 70% population uber wealthy. 

CT hates poor people make clear. move alone may add 50-70 days time takes get back life normal.

Woah point sources sounds like misinformation? Yeah. big deal all. forget frequently try take drink bite food. leave work take off, feel good. taking bra end day.

I'm going keep wearing mask indoors high risk situations get point new mutation virus horizon may may respond vaccine.  wear forever then? one stopping Stupid pointless purpose except pissing Californians.

People afraid take mask off, can’t bare wear anymore, ambivalent (like myself). like trauma, process move different paces empathetic it, we’ll get though this. CA probably one state (especially southern CA) could done outdoor schooling large tents part year. plus mask would incredibly safe. Odd wasn’t ever option Oh lockdown going since October, it’s curfew enacted January (and supposed last 28 days according premier)  People neighborhood still give nasty stares you’re wearing mask outdoors. pendulum swing far People still travel. Good job Connecticut. people lose use legs unexpectedly? feeling like realized literally ever child 16 unvaccinated. That's huge portion population unprotected. Luckily seems get sick.

Hopefully something else, vigilant next 5-10 days case. shut two days. I'm done breathing mildly uncomfortable. Call wuss want, unpleasant. I'm also done glasses fogging up. would reason they'd never rescind orders, seems unlikely. guess that's thing, minutes hours usually?  I’m dad. I’m getting vaccinated good society part array safety measures, long middle pandemic, take additional precautions accordingly. us behave way, faster pass finish line. join us! someone extreme risk severe covid complications, we're talking death territory, completely symptom free vaccine doses. much risk partner 2 days. summer labor day people (re schools, summer work schedules) Schools reopened San Francisco, hybrid model, parents choice send kids school, continue remote.

The question whether schools offer in-person option next school year, question they'll offer remote option. flu season said people may want to.  mean sooner says that, better. would push maybe people get vaxxed people covid subs seem somehow. I'm starting think 'what studies say' used place 'what reddit says' considering often used shoot information points still need cautious.

Highly, highly doubt people leaving comments like read 'studies'. Hopefully vaccine = pandemic attitude come back bite us ass. I'm sure another surge happens everyone start screeching, ""we knew would spikes!"" despite saying otherwise now.

Shit's irritating. experts held listened vaccines got here. vaccines tho sudden every redditor armchair scientist thinks amount googling could ever equate years years study.

We've shit year, what's another month two make sure vaccine rollout goes well everyone assuming will?

/rant Cool! us got shitty ass sinovac? indeed. also understand extended closure meant do. protect choose get vaccinated? made choice live it. that’s total bullshit. I’m Sacramento 9 10 people don’t wear masks outside, zero issues. cop handing tickets lol hope becomes permanent fixture people sick. Flu cases way year, great Like flu shot...my fuck, awful inconvenient live, state mask mandate many businesses taking mask required signs down. switching signs saying masks recommended suggested, longer required. businesses still requiring masks, general they're process phased here. wow that’s crazy much farther behind are, i’m early 20s second dose couple days Private businesses still allowed set rules.

Never mind fact chances getting covid random passer infinitesimal case. person would unmasked, infected, exhale close enough face breathe in. virtually impossible outdoors.  Ah yes, can’t help daring breathe near feast. don’t need “fast science”, need “good science”. 

This “bad science”. totally F’d up. started wrong hypothesis, “Covid isn’t airborne”, massive inconvenience hypothesize airborne. Despite fact evidence strongly suggested airborne, clung hypothesis, setting unreasonably (nearly impossible standards) prove otherwise.  

The NYTimes actually great article today bad F’d up. 

Just one example many:  contemporary example attitude, initial public health report Mount Vernon choir case said may caused people “sitting close one another, sharing snacks stacking chairs end practice,” even though almost 90 percent people developed symptoms Covid-19. Shelly Miller, aerosol expert University Colorado Boulder, struck incident initiated study team scientists, documenting space less full usual, allowing increased distance, nobody reported touching anyone else, hand sanitizer used three people arrived early arranged chairs. spatial pattern transmission, implicating airflows, nobody within nine feet front first known case, mild symptoms. 

Now, science eventually worked, always should, enough evidence 9 months ago.   vast majority worlds population means get vaccine, Including population japan? Athletes built entire careers around Olympics. Pushing 3-4 years solution. Many past prime 2024. CDC's website percentages people side effect Phase 3 trials, placebo vaccine.

I’m sure US fall pack developed countries, there’s guarantee we’ll bottom. headline straight Spring 2020 sad...the US sooo many vaccines everywhere...we def send around world. pandemic horrible driving big wedge wealthy poor - clearly pandemic proves countries need work together get this.... really. uncommon means. big breakout work 3 got it. bunch people work scared mRNA vaccines J&amp;J people. Seeing J&amp;J like 70% effective unexpected breakthrough cases large outbreak. makes sense. Hope best stories. One day get better point keep hanging there. Government blame cases. Farmers kicked politically suit government. could deferred Act till much later date placate farmers time being. I'm someone vaccinated largely acting differently -- yet. I'm still eating indoors, ready get plane, etc.

For county still going cases kids can't vaccinated yet. know kids face less risks that's great. I'm also content wait another month vaccination rate (hopefully) catches cases drop.

There many reasons get vaccinated many reasons immediately go back 100% normal -- he's shaming going things, would say let get time. last 14 months hard people lot different ways may take people longer recover.  Actually, spark memories year half rather forget. moving hoping never wear ever again. Damn. wonder masks go. 70% vaccination end mask mandates, does? main reason likely innate resistance Covid, result past exposure related viruses, potentially including even genetic adaptation.

Laos directly borders Yunnan Province Southwest China horseshoe bat virus sampled 96% genetic match SARS-CoV-2. Horseshoe bats endemic Laos, Cambodia Myanmar, seen limited spread Covid. Cambodia, bat virus sampled 92% genetic match. pretty likely populations area routinely exposed related viruses, nearly deadly Covid.

There studies shown widely disseminated [genetic coronavirus infection East Asian populations.

There's nearly enough evidence say conclusively regions experienced limited spread, seems fairly plausible.

Recently, Indian variants seem leading increased spread, particularly Cambodia, still none things experienced anything like scary outbreak. Canada fucked. don’t start going back normal soon I’m going start exploring possible options moving USA. Fair enough.  12 percent first doses, 2.5 percent doses. Nothing happy about, course. putting there. life unexpected happening... 

But commercial says ""Does spark joy'.. answer no, gone... Good luck paying money back ya dingus! dad vaccinated like still worried Covid surge fall vaccine won’t work variants then. Won’t go theater go airplane. 

I think older (62). 30 living life like normal since got second Moderna dose late March. 

What’s point getting vaccinated aren’t going act differently? could turn Google shall find sources: Reports week finally admit airborne disease? wonder people mistrust cdc  Wearing mask never bothered me, understand coming from. past year I've found good uses mask wearing (public transportation, large group settings, forth), I'm glad tied wear time. mind wearing where's required. point I'm used wearing mask often forget one on. might another mask mandate something unexpected happens.  There’s 1,000 breakthrough cases CO alone? Holy shit Portland. I'm tired go insanely awesome we're stage year. saved millions lives. Damn must know alot people personally know 3 breakthrough cases recent studies 'only' show 95% effectiveness severe symptoms death.

You can't wear mask? fucking hard? jail. get pool vacation days pool sick days, used interchangeably. Probably gonna get voted hell anyone else grossed go crowded places now?

SCMP generally portrays China negatively, even pro-HK protests. Segregation sullied word. call something else obviously. Sporting events already planning luckily. meanwhile Indiana 37% first  I'd rather zero-COVID economy slower vaccinations, COVID hotspot slightly faster vaccination.

The worship almighty $$$ everything.

This title obviously clickbaity.  zero symptoms except mild arm pain injection site. Think alternative. potential life time negative health effects, 24-48 hours mild flu like symptoms? Actually cloth ones went friend’s quilt/art piece. using disposables pretty much, use one. Im betting Indian athletes (if athletes) quarantined. Im assuming Japan stringent covid policies place based fact they’ve deaths Looks like Pfizer working IOC vaccinate one hand makes sense.

On I'm convinced experienced COVID might likely admit complaints upon receiving vaccine. 

Only 2002 subjects 30% COVID. takes 6 people swing results percentage point, many items close. India chance vaccine said, nah fam.  Yes, exactly manner Spanish Flu. long trail diminishing cases years come, falls within background levels 'flu-like illness.' take precautions kids. impacted mental state, made better instead worse. guess needed whole shutdown reset refresh. &lt;insert randomly selected wave right summer killed e.g. close 70000 people Germany nothing people going vacations kinds group activities summer course... almost year. went insane got clue ok hiding houses behind masks. Looking general graph comes google average cases 20k April, it’s pretty steadily decreasing overall—really semantics “plummeting” means know get people get it? Money. Pay health insurance premiums, give bonuses, pay raises. said everyone gets bonus get vaccinated X date, number would bump quite bit. 2 months late cloth masks, 10 months late double-masking, CDC contemplating continuing poor track record modifying mask guidance prematurely. 

It's politicized, disgusting. expected Japan one ones would mandate reason. get kicked school country vaccinated. true, definitely think it’s choice American citizens. point adult wants one get one US. research recently uni yep, mandatory influenza vaccines least children 1960s, stopped 1991. AZ blood clot side effect happen low blood platelets? 

It’s hard take AZ without knowing don’t solution prevention especially countries figured what’s causing it. Ok, trust error. data updated two days ago NH first dose 61.2%, second New England MA. know they’re last fully vaccinated Agree. don’t trust science it’s often explained paternalistic way don’t understand. It’s looks condescending. Nursing research demonstrated decades. 

I think scientific community going need learn earn trust public. u/annoyedatlantan - finished supply demand updates? :) Even backwards ass state 26% we're literally worst state America live. Darwin win eventually. Colorado one fitest states country sailors PT everyday believe, average young plump redditor gonna well lol, complain medical school debt less mortgage, make 1/5 income doctor. payoff med school debt years, takes 30 years pay equivalent amount.

totally divorced reality.

You also downvoted 12 year olds people clueless reality. both.

I saw article recently said Japan also prioritizing elderly first plans everyone else vaccinated September.

Pair borders closed foreigners allowed olympics competing and... guess makes sense, backwards sort way. Japan pretty bad whole covid thing since day 1. Thanks! I'm glad know symptom onset seems hours rather minutes, cycle home sore arm feeling feverish would enough make consider taking bus :) people heard news, walking two buildings? There's nothing wrong wearing mask want to. absolutely nothing anyone else, think fair call ""security blanket.""

Not case experience past weekend. Folk saying things like ""well we'll keep wearing kids vaccinated"". Even though - - outdoors breezy. line tinged enough holier thou-ness wearing it, - better take shunned. He’s anti-vaxx got vaxxed repeatedly made public statements urging people get vaxxed. admin’s Operation Warp Speed helped fund development, manufacturing, purchase vaccines.

Millions per day? It’s possible COVID reach kind death toll US. 1% fatality rate. talking worldwide? Still impossible multi-million daily death toll COVID. Wow, literally could wrong simple Google would shown you. 822 caught COVID twice, 819 Covid breakthrough cases.

74 cases breakthrough infections died. (What would expect considering groups vaccinated first) 9 deaths suspected related COVID.

Breakthrough infections act like normal COVID cases respects, vaccines simply take every person, it’s part pushing get shots every arm important. still wouldn’t want get turned causing complications government reused acknowledge it. Lots countries require vaccinated, still decent vaccination rates. difference Japan lot vaccination hesitancy. Japan needs get stuff together suffer something akin Super Bowl surge. Death coming vigilant. Hope alright, mildly curious effects terms COVID protection. Flu vaccines like usually give sore arm well, I'm preparing worst case ;) Interesting, got dtap years ago think really hurt either. right kids working up, remember used get nervous getting shot kid. weird mind hype things way worse actually are. might like mechanism picky eaters gag certain foods. probably thinking exact thing, can't say exactly time safe.

So June 2023 Fauci make announcement fully vaccinated people mask distance? 


I get cautious man, announce vaccinated people good go crying loud Thanks! That's suspected, wanted sure :) Germany vaccine rate goes brrrr less 2 deaths day throughout summer well average mortality. Winter whole different discussion. Push till spring next year Well don’t give fuck kid. I’m done COVID. Or...maybe reality nuanced?

Case point: US far people per capita vaccinated EU country despite fact large portion population thinks vaccines cause autism. 

So guess EU backwards compared US? agree Gotltlieb's take. Vaccines readily available point time everyone 16+ eligible appointment since April 19th, states opened eligibility sooner. Indiana March 31 16+. 


There excuse point, get vaccine ditch mask, messaging going forward.   winter kinda nice. Helped keep face warm. think past weekend, May 8th may actual date last states started trending downwards. person troll, they’re really dedicated troll 6 year-old account. Lol. figured Reddit would behind one. Imagine crying doctor student loan debt!

The answer (rhetorical) question btw average doctor US makes $300k per year. yeah, think they’re gonna alright. lots diseases. miracle modern medicine vaccines many them.

I know Japan, US currently 16 vaccines recommended children (some protect multiple diseases). need boosters, flu vaccine recommended annually. Billions masks pollution per day huge cost hold that! Oh wow cant believe smug dorks telling you’re stupid doesn’t get people didn’t listen first place hop board. point need dropped. Private businesses free continue require free to, instance, allow people carry guns premises disallow smoking. infringements anyone's rights.

The outdoor mandates mostly stupid. wear one I'm thick crowd otherwise can't distance, there's point simply unnecessary. I'm jealous, best 5G access now. That's issue. Take workplace. 1/4 folks might vaccinated. what? gets hard separating two groups out. 100% people impacted mentally physically. fair people thread calling US ignorant submission linking google.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

I hope come across judgemental Japan. I'm trying say that, thier context, different thing US anti-vax movement would likely riot mandatory vaccinations. seen zero articles Japanese people asking open borders regarding Olympics general. Man culture Don’t even bother guy. He’s actually spreading vaccine hesitancy doubt effectiveness ‘yOu sTiLl sPrEaD iT!!1’ line. Don’t waste breath.  agree you. something like started, would easy shifted away vaccines back racism. incentives could put place urge people get vaccine? part, got vaccine. want go back normal. still restrictions enforced here. happened AstraZeneca

what happened AstraZeneca?  school debt bad, medical schools get overwhelmed applications accept 1-2% apply? Guess debt worth given many applications medical schools year.

Actually studies shown people back plane likely survive plane crashes. think glaring issue inevitability tourism Australia strategy needed keep vulnerable population safe outbreak. think strategy would employ vaccine campaign incentivize people en masse receive it, open vaccinated tourists, everything fine. that’s obviously easier said done. country might able get AstraZeneca voluntarily, I've never heard anyone answer greatest concern AZ vaccine:

For vaccinated individuals get infected symptomatic Covid-19, data suggest risk long-term effects like loss sense taste smell reduced due vaccine, risk still same? ~3% population least 1 dose. much better comparing numbers. started rolling vaccines elderly end April Tokyo, many smaller places even managed much yet. pathetic.

For record, I'm vaccinated know many people caught covid forces outside control. I'm suggesting preventable sense many offices need person (can work remotely) everyone would wear mask get vaccinated could kick return normalcy much quicker. Canadian coworker mine said got first shot April scheduled second shot August. Y'all enough vaccines distribution issue? ...I said said  Okay, phew, thank you. skimmed NRK's summary, must missed part. already thought good idea cancel year read Japan covid numbers vaccinations less think good idea. least Reddit convinced might lied numbers seem like they're much getting vaccinations out. work effectiveness AZ depending date second shot? often quoted oxford study compares 4 weeks 12 weeks doses 14 days second shot, 6 weeks 14 weeks first shot. find latter much effective.

 groups 14 weeks? significant difference mid long term effectiveness two strategies? japanese people like vaccines recent (completely unfounded) media hysteria around hpv vaccine people getting sick one sometime 80s whatever.  We’ve lot positive cases schools here. People hesitant need better explanations, told “Do I’m smart say so.”

The problem understanding science requires baseline scientific mathematical literacy many people completely lack.

It might actually *possible* give satisfying explanation everyone. 

The way society function people learn scientists science works--at point still actually understand details everything--so able trust experts.

“Do I’m smart say so” right argument, ""do every expert applied scientific method says so"" is.   never thought country used knickers vending machines would vaccine hesitant. I’m saying positive thing…but India (like USA previously) it’s political social issue.

Government deny anything wrong, health ministry refuse listen doctors, non-medical “experts” giving bad medical cures.

India waves played exactly USA. question is…how long government wakes up. problem chief, Twitter saw day RT’d Derek Lowe, he’s good follow. accept vaccines approved EMA even though AZ Janssen taken Norwegian vaccination program.

Id like read would Epoch Times, SCMP HK paper get I'm vaccinated near name? Wanda Vision Yeah that’s biggest difference, we’re actually getting vaccinated Indian government shipped vaccines world. radiate mRNA place. guess visit infamous school Florida now. #shedding even say inching. hold 700k+ number close 1st shots get ahead Biden's goal 7/4. certainly miss 1.5 million plus days, knew hold forever. worry that. Schools open several states kids simply problem. 1 time year, 1 kids sit week due contract tracing. Washington DC region. seems like every day another person know want vaccine gets first shot. There's like one two family members left. Every week like another step towards 2019. reopening vaccination process feels deliberate incremental. also insanely difficult hire people right now. also kids too. think I'm seeing ""emperor clothes"" argument certain extent outdoor mask wearing. Especially bunch kids barely keep masks properly.

What I'm afraid society stays part-frozen mode perpetuity completely substantiated fear. We're seeing elsewhere countries plan keep entire borders closed back this. Looking Israel, weeks ahead us vaccination, 7 new cases yesterday, pandemic them. Even 56% fully vaccinated, turns that's enough shut transmission kill this. think high vaccine take rate areas US, likely dying too. ....didn't need one year.. .gosh wonder could protected me??

Everything shut limited capacity. Shockingly, allowed meet people get sick often. also shit existence Ironic, US vaccines export, ""Helping nations"", China Russian vaccine exports, ""Vaccine Quid-Pro-Quo Diplomacy"" ""Influence operations nefarious motives""

If propaganda, know is. mean, fair vacationing San Diego instead SF last years. It’s really great city more, LA even worse lol No, they're gradually falling. Still reached record low U.S. first surge ended, though getting there. IOC secure doses, Pfizer donating enough vaccinate everyone going games, IOC want mandate vaccination whatever reason  fears you/a population fully vaccinated? trying understand mindset. No, vitro indicative it’ll evade immunity.  reason wife, myself, brother gotten vaccinated want pick choose moderna, timing appts. better walk anytime moderna. agree. Canada far less anti-vaxxers US, Canada track exceed US terms percentage population 1 dose within 2 weeks so. major issue distribute it. It’s ridiculous here. First, wrong syringes. Instead using 5 available 6 doses, didn’t move give vaccines. 

Then, plan distribute it. lot places didn’t coolers refused buy them. that, give vaccine? hospital? Hospitals west. don’t go see doctor there. There’s small clinics everywhere here. again, gives vaccine? internal med doc? ENT? GP? TCM doc? 

And decide gets it? 72 million doses, yea, great start, everyone needs two there’s 126million people here. 

This country mostly old people. go first. Yea, makes sense. Except, they’re ones catching spreading it. infections young people ignoring lockdown refusing wear masks cooperate way (also, work shitty offices refuse go remote even it’s possible). Old people generally isolated don’t go nearly much younger generation. get vaccine first? can’t decide. 

Now obviously doses go Tokyo Osaka, major metropolitan areas divided wards cities. government handles distribution? Japan govt? Tokyo? city government? 

Even better, Japan watched countries get GET PEOPLE VACCINATED means. knew issue going solved talk f*ing Olympics. I’m tired it. 

I half mind believe they’re loving fact cancel visas keep borders locked right now... that’s tinfoil-hat territory.

So mutations simultaneously ""scary"" also serious threat current vaccines?

Reported posting blatant doom mongering BS.

While mutations continually happen, inevitably fully escape vaccines. literal thousands variants, handful even warrant investigation, point none come close invalidating current vaccines.

To add MRNA tech allows rapid modification mutant appear, notion suddenly back square one laughably ridiculous think would classify 25%. definitely enjoyed aspects lockdowns, like go social events want go to. took everything pretty serious broke rules probably 3 times go small get togethers also helped. 

As mental health, began drinking heavily early months virus sober 2021. would argue mental health actually improved restrictions beginning lifted. Yeah, assuming people involved athletes. virus super contagious way slipping even tiniest lapse. Indians taking seriously 2 months ago. Unfortunately really doubt problem. Japan pretty good recording things Cmon  MODI begins. thing happened several inmates U.S.

My question heard update condition? Whether good bad, getting six doses wild would interesting see negative effects.  ramp AZ quite successful, capacity reserved EU anywhere near needs fulfill EU order, even perfect yield facility utilization idea Australia done well. attribute that? Maybe fraudulent, misleading terms capacity reserved fulfill EU order. 

The EU paid multi million capacity reservation fee advance, end little part combined supply chain actually dedicated EU order. I'm proud connecticut Smart! Reads border India...  agree even would hard do.

Thing is, hospitals nursing homes already short staff... law allows people put lives care risk, jobs, needs change.  People can't seem understand even smallest nuance. portion country thinks rona spreads like captain Tripps anyone wearing mask outside home biological terrorist. Another portion hears (correctly) masks fully effective preventing transmission decides ""masks work"" blanket manner (do people wear seat belts?). lot dead people thank latter group for.

Our educational system failed us. Ok I'm usually someone vent ""old people"" morning first stereotypical ""old people"" experience relation Covid need vent about.

I went electronics warehouse pick up. 2mins. sort thing. well distanced queue 10 people due taking people's names adresses case something happens. Alright. biggie. 

The people desk old couple could hear staff guy telling instructions loud clear way back me. Yet, kept asking every single step took *for-fucking-ever.*

*""Ok next need phone number."" - ""My phone number phone number?"" - ""Either phone number please. need able reach case something happens."" - ""Won't learn news anyway?"" - ""No need number"".*

And on. line kept getting bigger. Literally every single thing wanted discuss. end, turns somehow gave wrong info heard clerk go ""Well everything again!""... even actually bad part. annoying bring here. 

But guy front me, ca. 70yo, already looking like trouble tbh, refused give number email adress. made huge stink giving anyone, insisted, suddenly changed directions said either them. told can't come unless gives data, suddenly started shouting **""Who tell GO?!""** kept shouting *""Who said this?? mandated this??""* clerk calmly responded, state city. guy got told leave kept shouting way out. 

Like jfc people, really hard? I'm also sure understood wanted see help desk help line help something, meaning already got number pal! Drop act idiot lets fucking go already! environment pretty control covid, injecting primarily older people, guess quite cases could missed/swept rug grounds age maybe corona already.

But make mistake, might easy miss, must sure detected, point launch investigation, stop roll out, etc (Scandinavia style) not.

As CDC shown us, medical organizations political agendas, not. Also EMA dragged significantly feet topic, 100% sure oversupply mRNA would slam dunk stop AZ. coat soap usually don’t fog 45 minutes. However sometimes makes worse. short, I’m really sure either. miss able see. Yes, Australia apparently least trying something it. gotten lot population use wearing mask use wearing socks.

Stopping respiratory diseases spread pathogens would raise GDP due preventing lost productivity certain job sectors. would bolster economy major way blip people colds flus year. means less people taking time work completely preventable illness.  Ive vaccinated since early March still wear mask work public, I’m HoH. masks exhausting. can’t read lips/facial expressions I’ve developed anxiety interacting anyone public due knowing I’m going struggle communicate. teach (in person) I’ve never issue past year. continue wear mask indoors long it’s required/requested, don’t think agree masks harm one. It’s long, difficult 14 months. surprising different way.

According Bloomberg vaccine tracker, Australia quite behind Europe, yet Western European countries started age bracket yet. example mine (Spain) starting 50-59s regions. Ok turn QE raise interest rates.  2020 affected everyone deeply, think long-lasting effect utter lack trust people others. Aside lives lost, worry consequential impact pandemic don’t see gets better.

I lucky enough one love died complications covid, vaccinated. say without fucking doubt, thing stays far longest over.  behavior I've seen fellow Americans past year nothing short repugnant. I've already never big believer peoples' intelligence sense responsibility, generally speaking. never even remotely imagined bad. surprised, **lot** people reaaally get triggered anything remotely good said cities like NYC (SF another one) EU-Sanofi contract signed last autumn, first doses expected Q3 2021 earliest. almost makes Lyme disease. Well, that's law too. mean closing outer EU border course, intra ;) anecdotal experience, he's wrong. Essentially everyone know favor continuing covid behaviors state people lose work never went much first place. Everyone else wants move soon possible. sooner. Lol. Open borders freedom movement EU mantra makes sense say ""vaccinated people"" need wear masks indoors. Nobody knows really vaccinated. Non-vaccinated people absolutely stop wearing masks point too, especially anti-vaxxers care covid.

So either wear masks indoors none us wears masks indoors. Anything else silly. Singapore unfortunately zero-Covid. friend works front lines tester, they've lot trouble getting people vaccinated, still consistent community spread. say they're another lockdown, super frustrating. SG really incentivizing vaccinations worrying ""hermit"".

And course, source SCMP, Taiwan can't mentioned ;) Private for-profit prisons use unpaid surplus labor certain things like moving nuclear waste new containers cleaning septic tanks.

For ones afford pay via commissary fund -- any. Priest ShankarDas, 80,tested +ve Kumbh, Haridwar.Asked quarantine,he instead took crowded train1,000 km 2 Varanasi, shared taxi Mirzapur village. unknown many dozens infected en route,but 13 died village since tragic. hope able recover trauma wearing masks. She’s young, likely will. Yeah what's going India much better lockdowns earlier /s We're 70%, lots people states travel CT come vacation homes states. Plus, many CT residents work NY Boston theres possibility spread. people talk mind masks anyways state residents poll said want keep mandate. Yet cut EDD apparently “not verifying myself”. fucking state. choose vaccinated.

Their employer choose fire it. Japanese since late 19th century worn masks variety reasons. I've wondered might see something similar carry culture over. live free country, can't require everyone get every vaccine world go Well, supplier meeting contractual obligation extend contract. Especially partner reliable. 

No blame AZ, ramping manufacturing new vaccine likely hard finding it. surprise see company failing would depend vaccine uptake much community spread is. Nothing comment insinuated type fraud ill gained PPP loan. Yeah two equally deadly respiratory viruses roaming around instead one originally really sound like win. Like flu kills 40 50 thousand people every year really need another virus top killing another 40 50 thousand people every year too. nonsense. Anyone vaccinated fired.

With current lack vaccines (even though see end, hope enough people vaxxed september), passing law allowing would pretty bad move Basically, mostly teenagers want party. masks, safety distance people. cause another wave infecteds eliminate masks outside reasonable time faith eliminating masks mandates together

Or maybe they're little slower. truly permanent mask mandate would genuinely bizarre. would need *actual* evidence believe slope slippery. ""They're slow"" evidence. Blood *withdrawal* part vaccination process.

Not worry, **trrrrained** prrofessionals. Dr. Acula lifetimes experience That’s did. Got first dose NG, Kroger better second appointment got dose 2 there. 

Gotta say, National Guard soo much better. NL fine distribution, vaccine delivery bottleneck Except testing early pandemic really available, that's non covid19 excess deaths occurred.

ELI5: would wear off? Eg, wears 18 months, deployed six months, would know? Happy blue cheese day! May. Vaccines available almost half year places least public. 

All excuses reasons see aside, looks like government want vaccinate public. yet want host Olympics. Many ""Excess Deaths"" attributed COVID19 came early pandemic widespread testing. two months, deaths attributed Pneumonia, Dementia, Diabetes, Heart Disease, Stroke big unexpected spike. test everyone determine deaths least attributed part COVID19, sadly many fell cracks early pandemic. 


In total, 150,000 deaths expected listed non covid, IMHO I'm quite certain were. reffering number deaths. makes sense, thank you. keep 500-900k first doses per day grind out. Thank you. seems like group can't agree disagree. think instead would want applaud science makes possible protect people future needed, seems not. Nope wear masks. Doesn’t much good kids pull pull sneeze everything. 

Our new “Covid measures” include wiping desks wet wipes asking kids use hand spray come in. That’s it. distrust vaccines here. abide precautionary principle. know something stops spread, let’s keep using spread stops extra months.

A extra months wearing mask mall sufficient trade ensure pandemic costed trillions dollars, millions lives, shut society, resurge.

Precautionary principle. Look up. abided point pandemic, wouldn’t mess in. cells still react 17 years post infection * 84/1.2 = 70 days (DE)
* 17m/0.1m = 170 days (NL)

You're way ahead neighbours!  paying attention scientists saying Indian strain believing science? guess according believing science entails listening scientists whose theories line want happen. 

I'm expecting wear mask forever, ignoring obvious signs third wave going hit soon also ignoring science. moment, says new variant mutations ""may impact countermeasures including vaccines."" 

Also, wearing mask mean I'm ""living fear"" lol. means cloth covering face high probability prevent spread disease. afraid that. I’m wearing mine public indoors state mandate says it’s okay take reached certain point. (I’m fully vaccinated post 2 weeks sat btw)

I’m still going wear mine cold politeness. states lift ~~obnoxious~~ necessary lifesaving lockdowns.


There fixed Oh god like Shin Godzilla probably old people would die hit mild cold, got COVID mild symptoms couple days died. 

I'm also convinced really large number people covid testing widely available. Anecdotal, personally know person sick Kentucky late Jan. person sick traveling ski Utah first week March. fairly mild symptoms early 60s, positive antibody tests.  worth protect susceptible covid, many peoples eye’s it’s worth protect every last immunocompromised person. 

The reality getting many healthy people possible vaccinated thing done immunocompromised people. not, people think herd immunity for?  Except deaths processed weeks months happen already lagging indicator current conditions.

Just one example: Fairfax County, VA spike cases deaths December, due lack resources process deaths different every European country. care keeping people safe, also care people think me. wore mask 2 weeks post second shot. Gotta throw America bit karma Yeah that's repeatedly debunked. seen elsewhere retroactively looking excess deaths year year, objective, trackable number. lymph node collarbone swell size (and firmness) marble got first shot. Happy Cake day. less bureaucrats vaccines getting delivered schedule politicians backbone. concentrated South, hot summers, driving people indoors sweet, sweet AC. Reminds office scenes 'Shin Godzilla'. admit, murder olympics sound pretty awesome US rollout anything chaotic. state run sites extremely efficient, websites work well. sure you’re talking about. point logistics blame 1% japan vaccinated. long way bottlenecks. Yeah, even second shot Pfizer, sore arm, slight headache bed, next day felt slow half drunk brain fog, along lethargy, overall super mild. I'm 33, male, expected honest. vape, known reduce antibody response, still, imagine I'm less protected lesser response. Many, many healthy people know around age much side effect all. totally evil since millions honest people struggling hard put food table family pay rent since pandemic. hope greedy stupid people pay stolen really need help. Quite likely end booster particularly vulnerable, like encourage flu shots elderly. Staying away people easily communicable diseases, keeping surfaces clean, working home, living bubble extent.

I associate who's immunocompromised that's basically do. thing changed housemates stayed home last year due COVID, that's all. Immunocompromised people living normal lives prior COVID, sure people think that. going tricky customer facility I’m sure would love loosened mask restrictions, might hesitant employee. Things feel different don’t choice not. doubt employers take employees opinions account whether feel safe ready change. 

It’s hard enough enforcing mask restrictions, people going asked show proof vaccination fights start again. assign every person residency “ticket” individual name, organize time slot designated location, get vaccinated, probably registered system vaccinated, etc. imagine, quite feat takes time organize.

This Scotland essentially smooth majority adults first dose. think bit blame. Mines went dog shit while. Depression anxiety awful. Nothing formal. immunologists say may offer better protection don’t recommend unless shortages/extenuating circumstances. I'm 53 student loans paid retire.

Not best foot, put one forward... happening though? know attempts match death certificates COVID-19 symptoms even death without positive test. Seems like erring overcounting side. I’m still really surprised WV. 

That said, good job people WV getting shots.   Flu instance, speed design mRNA jabs would perfect deal flus ability fuck us last minute rollouts every autumn Think selfish entitled prick.  truly high expectations, US shit bed hard regards COVID 40% voters content government handled it.

If truly high expectations, rank low many important metrics like healthcare, infrastructure, life expectancy, etc. despite wealthiest nation earth barring petrostates small countries. significant percentage population actively resists improvements areas routinely votes make worse. also. Completely resolved 2 weeks. really seems like care part effects you. corrected number people would spontaneously blood clot anyway. scared many people.

Tell it. north Texas resident, biggest UNO Reverse. Abbott Cruz, expectation distribution ""I know we're fucked, exactly fucked we?"". million years, never would guessed vaccine response U.S. -- let alone Texas -- would somehow wind _better_ world.

I signed Allen FD similar experience yours. paperwork handled scanning QR code eventbrite ticket phone (and small card Moderna 2). counting post-injection wait, took whopping 3 minutes, navigating traffic cones. wish could get annual flu shot quickly... “Safety” isn’t specific could easily used restrict rights nothing safe. You’re throwing assumptions though. That’s metaphor past year illiterate? guy claiming said GOING HAPPEN. say going happen. said something worried about. Significant levels immune escape possibility MANY scientists concerned about. Depends reduction is, going 95% effective say 85% effective would still make effective average flu jab instance. Key thing hospitalisations deaths. vaccine still prevents majority both, efficacy drop really matter. US also worried people showing second doses far apart. much concern UK due NHS admintering vaccine. mean like science kids getting hospitalized MIS-C losing sense taste months years? Yeah, thanks thanks. Let's get kids vaccinated first.

And people would love get vaccine can't, allergies immune disorders. matter, rest us part protect getting vaccinated. survived original SARs still detectable immunity decade later instance.

Never heard before, encouraging. Good see. Anecdotally, seen lot ads getting vaccine last couple weeks maybe helping. Staying eradicated definitely answer pandemic. China sporadic outbreaks try that. lockdown close travel, apply massive testing drives isolation tracing. lockdowns stricter many west, they're full isolation attempts. Full isolation would orders magnitude expensive, one mistaken travel quarantine makes again. 

The mass testing strategy might well replicable, late vaccines out, pandemic end those. Well, tell republican ~~friends~~ acquaintances better get **their** shot June 1st, **Biden** send brown socialist foreigner.  however, take consideration reopening plans. example, forcing work environment puts danger

Like COVID? Google data, accurate, whether cases deaths show covid completely irrelevant them. I'm surprised care vaccine that's really case. datas correct, essentially nothing happened past year them. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   Ah partner keeps company it’s healthy relationship got better. you’re working. Yeah rare indeed. I’m happy you. concern would start whole process another huge pandemic. words, mine. Supply issue literally choking america last month states expanded age groups No. Facial expressions hugely important children. Especially babies toddlers. honest would quite surprise boosters ever rolled everyone initial vaccine process finishes up.

Instead see targeted vulnerable similar way flu jabs, 50s underlying conditions.

The risks 50s without underlying health conditions always small. vaccinated risk even variants even smaller No, vaccines reduce transmission well severity. keep dying, keep getting sick first place. 100% time, course, nothing medicine 100%.

I done math myself, I'm pretty sure vaccine far effective preventing transmission masks. government failing every step way. I'd say government performance perspective they're one worst advanced countries world.    There's reason CNN picked one line one doctor displayed vs hundreds others could chosen from. problem exactly someone said, media using push agenda. There's meeting Wednesday, probably shortly that. sitting glovebox since day got it. FDA today Advisory Board Wednesday last read. Among dr f joe b charging unvaccinated ones? not, I'd deny vaccinated get legroom. getting vaccinated, helping immunocompromised people can't vaccianted. think herd immunity is?  God definitely sound pleasant, needing risk ass risk getting fired, definitely changed view Japan, government anything it? Like trying impose minimum distance per person? mean teaching 200 kids!? definitely high risk job  go: happens society admires authoritarian beliefs point authoritarian control important benefits authoritarian regime. 

Japan unique society understands dangers idolizing overly conservative beliefs. Prior 20th century vowed never loosing end particular battle again. 

However, even try accomplish progressive projects, can't seem leave behind imbedded conservative hierarchy past. 

The reason Japan stagnating allow younger people agency society. business government, young Japanese people even opinion managed. People even able sign yet. Nurses finished old people start. demand iirc spectators outside country.  Well, 46% Americans received least one dose. 34% fully vaccinated. France 26% 12%. I'd say quite lot worse.  Good news indeed. say vaccine less effective (in terms catching disease) variants, still protects severe disease hospitalization.

I gather boosters eventually needed, sound like may able stay ahead thing. good bro, found mildly entertaining :) would likely effects. already know happens get 3 doses, basically nothing beyond 2nd. There's good reason assume next 3 would different. well clearly makes workout harder. intense cardio workouts? walking treadmill trying run 8+ mph? mask getting soaked sweat?

I can’t breath well enough nose get enough oxygen intense workout. end run treadmill wet mask sucked mouth every breath. stop couple times catch breath.

It doable don’t like people claiming complete non-issue.

It anecdotal noticed almost never anyone cardio machines unless walking. think sign people find intense cardio mask troubling. mean that's valid fear tbh. too, even it’s 5-10 percent unvaccinated that’s still pretty big surge open up. Social issues evolve organically time countries don’t conservative religion telling people live. Japan rooted tradition, fore front LGBTQ issues compared many Asian countries. Things change slowly there, lot ways, change. never gotten impression it’s conservative country, standards, visits. ridiculous cautiousness causing people die Covid.

Once vaccine safety verified, need start vaccinating. What’s alternative, though? numbering/letting system variants difficult remember. works scientists newsreels. We’ve naming infectious diseases place origin long time. assume logic begin with, rather simple emotional desire feel safe. efforts Japan took early on

Like exactly? Giving every household 2x terrible masks COVID solution, implementing quarantine system (they ask self-quarantine) less testing far smaller countries like Singapore Australia? causing deaths? AZ vaccine sold at-cost. Part reason got IP experienced companies Oxford giving IP stipulation vaccine sold at-cost. (That plus easier storage/transportation vaccine crucial, especially poorer countries.)

That stop pandemic status ended, continue indefinitely poorer countries, AZ really making anything.

AZ overestimated experienced making vaccines realise issues could crop-up. already people outraged “mandatory vaccines” despite fact isn’t happening plans it. source this? far behaving way flu facilitat influenzas existence. trained experienced field ... sharing feeling? Yeah that's said big name athletes. ones lose least make biggest impact staying home. think faster drop mandates faster get point one cares others (mask not). longer drag mandates non mask folks resent masked folks. Let people want make socially unacceptable harass others choice wear wear mask. thinking Oh misread comment. Thanks that. I'm sure older generations Japan would love that. There’s law says phone number email address, much less give people. Blame place requiring it.  Plus 30 million doses Astrazeneca produced local company imported materials. 50k cases day \~6 months (globally) .. 

they EXPECT variant escapes vaccines. 

&amp;#x200B;

India Brazil neither sequencing vaccinating.

decent chance escape variants already there.

&amp;#x200B;

In summary, high SARS-CoV-2 incidence rates act increase vaccine escape risk. Maintaining low case numbers using NPIs vaccines crucial time.

&amp;#x200B;

SARS-CoV-2 incidence vaccine  cases among unvaccinated. 

They've used Sinopharm AstraZeneca vaccines, significantly less effective mRNA vaccines—especially preventing infections entirely.

This first real wave infections they've had, little natural immunity population.

The ""worse India"" description comparing confirmed cases, take account disparity testing rates, consider rate serious illness death. Among vaccinated appears working keep illness mild. made really hot fiance really cold. fun night sleep dose 2s Okay, makes sense. Bruh 341,000 shots given members public medical professionals. around 100M vaccine shots country last week. J-government requires doctors nurses administer shots. soon expanded dentists. call letting veterinarians it, think movement that, yet. believe there’s meeting Wednesday. 

Is anywhere information updated?  article, looks like nurse practitioner on-site guess person would able prescribe meds.

That concerns I'm afraid focus medication therapy. medications necessary work great people, lot side effects finding right one tricky.

It really seems like conflict interest company sells drugs one prescribing them.  Nah big name athletes. also ones could make biggest impact staying home percentage US population vaccinated today, wonder. 

Seems like going crazy day day area. GF got J&amp;J one week ago. anecdotal observations seems divide urban rural areas. live medium sized city compliance high everywhere, whenever visit family rural areas I'm shocked see entire venues (mostly stop get gas) completely maskless. Current 7 day average = 662 deaths/day

662 * 365 = 241,630 assuming Japan stringent covid policies place based fact they’ve deaths

Lol, no. Foreigners allowed come Japan, Japanese people travel problem. requirements like showing negative PCR test 72 hours flight back, return Japan want. government ask stay home, zero checks controls. would love - case little complicated. live Australia. moved Germany 3 months Corona started.

Travel Australia extremely difficult country still closed. citizen would right return; there: long waiting list, flights expensive mandated 2 week hotel quaratine arrival. Furthermore would probability unable return Germany fiancée lives decide lift total travel restrictions. 

I pay anyway. Corona nuked professional life - still working good amount, income 2020 literally 4% earned 2019. expat qualify governmental support either Germany Australia; whilst visa extremely restrictive permits presently doing. course constantly trying find someone willing take on, let's say circumstances helping stand anhiliated job market. really able survive thanks savings generosity partner. Probably best we've lockdown many months - spend money have.

But hey, family good health I'm absolutely blessed partner able help fill gaps financially time. really excited possibilities getting vaccinated open up! live one densest populated areas county, HOPE drop mask mandates soon. hell going vaccines? Hmm well Emergency use, mean colleges going take responsibility adverse reactions? 

They liable approved like required vaccines. vaccinated? so, would care? chances getting low, chances actually getting sick spreading even lower. Go back life without mask. Ah yes, quick easy trip Japan Portland! Right, right, sooo... guess US stop protesting voted deserve every disservice face. Missed memo that, thanks FYI. mean, apologize. way comment worded implied people became immune *individually* 67%, toss dice every time encountered virus particles. immunity works. vaccinated with, let's say, CoronaVac (Sinovac) get 67% protection symptomatic Sars-Cov-II, 33% cases get rona become symptomatic good chances mild inconvenience sick days week, unvaccinated people close still catch rona you, put serious danger.


On hand, see saying individually people either become immune virus following vaccine contradicts fact efficacy/effectiveness measured percentage binary. population gets vaccinated vaccine 67% efficacy/effectiveness, chance individuals seroconverting 67%, 33% seroconverting thus immune. 

If meant, saying thing and, again, apologize. 

However, study linked unreadable me. speak Spanish (or Portuguese can't tell apart). would nice link study language communicating link page/paragraph relevant specific argument. would helped.  Imagine someone saying polio Exactly! want protected be. Remeber 2 weeks flatten curve? vaccine prevent running hospitals. curve bee really flattened. many doses quickly? come from? suggesting failure CDC deliver testing kits labs prohibited threat nation? Yeah, issue they've YEAR this. clearly slacking, whatever reason. I'm wearing unless mandatory. asked people past year follow science wear stupid thing. Well I'm following science going wear mask. Shaking intensifies Literally means figuratively. Sheer stupidity end human race let disease mutate kill us all. Family / roommates health care workers legit priority group IMO...social circle...um well support system...but business associates getting grafty... ..who expertise experience carry task..

The land video games high quality electronics can't figure out? Dr Mario would shocked. hope are, NY least could walk large chain drug store get vaccinated. I’m 40 underlying conditions that. already got vaccinated ago…but it’s non issue anyone wants get done. impossible get decent workout wearing one opinion

What? Lol.

It's really problematic all. Especially working out, referring lifting weights strength building.

It's pretty annoying Lactate Threshhold VO2 Max stuff, make impossible. One still get necessary O2, focus even ensuring proper breathing mask sucking hard face distracting mental fortitude, impossible. ideal, impossible. pharmacists permitted give shot - doctors nurses doctor supervision. special conditions dentists also give shot.

Japan shortage medical staff, overwhelmed COVID cases (even low compared rest world), going really hard time getting real volumes vaccination going. Yes. I’m accused avoiding vaccinations I’d like know fuck could get vaccinated first place. It’s available me. I’d love get it. Portland convention center accepting anyone 18 appointment needed. guess I'm thinking social conservatism. sure exact number Japan’s cases always super low Maybe basketball player would that. Someone paid enough care that. people probably wanna compete world stage. one massive factor flu never going away transmit across species, never fully eradicate even humans figured out. Covid benefits that, can't get humans figure we're ultimately boat. 

I want make point could get herd immunity technical perspective. never will, could. another type coronavirus, another type flu virus. Yeah, now. Another lockdown won’t anymore. US isn’t country world, many countries still haven’t started person schooling. Pro sports going around world last year. don’t know single league skipped season. couple random players, big names recall, opted peak last year, vaccines can’t imagine players opting Olympics. Gov stepping protect citizens? bird? actually 17k current trend around 12k 19th. Combined 35% adults and, 75% +70ers 60% +60ers vaccinated, seems like safe decision. watch US military help distribution really want able get outside base. There’s nothing wrong someone wanting get vaccine. body choice...  workouts do? mind mask lifts, intense cardiovascular cloth mask feels like waterboarded. They’re bs saying months getting massively voted, yet 

BIG vax resistance specific demographics, can't named due sub rules.  explain meant then? definitely read said. “We won’t worry whether 5-12 year olds vaccinated.” comment 2 hours old, case then. isolated long Olympics coming up... Maybe that's live long. Exact thought you, CDC comes says otherwise I'm still wearing mask. Even though I'm fully vaccinated. maybe dumb question, people scared virus, also want get vaccinated? Based reading comments guess Japanese wary vaccinations based past. expect get past covid one willing get vaccinated? something government properly distributing vaccines currently have, along citizens wary vaccinations?  work place wants us back full staff still 6 feet apart idea percent vaccinated. started half work split schedule wfh can't see us fully lab. enough space begin stay 6 feet apart? don’t one exception. would love able go gym maskless, especially cardio.

It done difficult.

I hesitant push mask changes protect children knowing people vaccinated claim gyms don’t generally children working could easily implement vaccine check passport type thing. Pollen grains measured micrometers viruses measured nanometers. Hint: nanometers smaller. Masks better job blocking allergens viruses. reason people China India long worn masks protect pollution. Obviously that’s reason continue mandate danger covid sufficiently past, people aren’t stupid either. surprised most. movies see army helicopters medic tents situation. local doc scheduling appts. US still well supply kicked up. man. countries horrible. Seriously, fuck olympics anyways. Boring international dick waving contest exploits damages countries host it. Olympic committee parasites.  hear ya, would CEOs really lie something critical badly? could bring massive backlash mention give much-unneeded ammunition antivax movement. I'm pretty much level pre-covid, although say completing tasks really hard motivate lately. still basket socks need sort refilled multiple times new loads socks. started covid projects lost motivation complete moved onto others. isnt really abnormal me. actually pretty positive outlook going forward people get shots things returning normal pretty soon. little bit ""Reentry Anxiety"", I've vaccinated 2 months recently went family eat inside restaurant first time long time still wear gloves grocery store makes feel better (I know useful still like them). I'm already making plans things summer.

All extended family except 2 youngest one uncle's branch fully vaccinated finally celebrated first family holiday (Mother's day) together since covid started (minus uncle dropped gift). adults happy finally able safely see again. sad part (almost 4yo) niece crawled lap curled cousins arrived. scared seen long told ""didn't like different people"". eventually warm rest family some, really sad see. parents part brothers covid bubble we've pretty regular contact nieces, first time seen cousins Aunt/Uncle year pretty heartbreaking. hope better starts kindergarten/preschool. know shy awkward kid school (heck still am) think ever scared new people was. percentage population yes, total number no. fact vaccines real even people Alabama taken large enough degree effect. isn’t magic 70% population vaccinated light switch turns on, think dimmer. herd immunity isn’t magic number.

I say more, combination natural immunity vaccinated people amount substantial percentage everywhere United States drop cases precipitous coming weeks argument forgotten. fraction misleading characterization. Yup. 1782 cases today compared 11k daily cases 20 days back. general, Mumbai disciplined crowd amongst Indian cities. differs every state (and even county/municipality). mine, county-run clinics centralized sign online registered they'd reach lagged behind eligible groups (ie focused older high priority groups - easier process think stay focused older). mass vaccination sites came online county website also let register say). various private pharmacies (like ones local grocery convenience stores) scheduling systems (of eligible course, ad hoc).

My county's eligibility requirements even differed state's (which unusual think). 

So registered county sites also mashed refresh pharmacy websites got slot. reached county site appointment little later (which take since got one via pharmacy). Yeah, exceptionally poorly. *still* didn’t exclude library prep artifact except least physiological cell system (with overexpressed L1).

It’s also telling paper submitted PNAS’s stupid direct submission system... work there. use pharmacy insurance, CVS place go. 

Let say, OMG. seem perpetually overworked stressed. Wouldn’t surprised don’t get breaks. yet patience saint. 

Fortunately won’t relying pharmacy staff counseling (at least first). feels kinda ironic offering counseling general public employees probably ones need it!!! received vaccine NL quite organized. Doctors asked provide RIVM high-risk patients, invited. Everyone else invited age postal address everyone supposed registered address anyway. contrast countries it’s quite well organized. others pointed out, issue currently deliveries. There’s lot capacity give vaccine, there’s enough vaccine received yet. Well, CDC's revised guidance suggests packed outdoor venues like concerts. I'm thinking people standing would otherwise considered personal space. I'm e.g. watching kids soccer game breezy day standing feet stretch arms touch you, likely big deal cut bullshit mask wearing anything.

I went dinner Saturday night local restaurant outdoor seating. Ponder absurdity. walk restaurant's curbside table wearing mask, everyone else sidewalk (peer pressure), reason soon step two feet sidewalk becomes OK take mask. space two feet somehow safe. shows total bullshit/theatre this. question - bullshit/theatre? people wearing masks outdoors idea safe eat maskless outdoors? sort confused things still look pretty bad first dose version chart: possible appears positive trend clumping things reported? mean we’re close 47 percent quarter percent day. that’s it’s opened 12-15 next week 2-11 hopefully sometime around September. We’re unlikely hit 70 percent nationwide 60 percent summer seems reasonable hopefuoky kids mix hit 65 percent winter hits. lot states also much higher like 70-80 percent suspect get winter. Tone hard read sure It’s precisely don’t want dealing 2023 ever want put minor restrictions help ensure this. hand want get near end game pull goalie last minutes sake since teams already 5 points ahead. I’d rather keep goalie place finish game. Hey wait minute call ""completely inept"". Japan 11th populated country world cramped together small island. coronavirus deaths Japan 10,860 deaths total compared USA 581,056. 53x deaths 2.6x population japan. think we're going gray area ""I'm vaccinated, want look like asshole wearing mask"" little while. I'm wondering it'll take shift culture side eye people, masking masking. 

And yes, get people want wear indefinitely. want to, it. But, vaccinated individual misses wearing lip stick... enjoy good pedantic break. Upvote you. Whole idea requiring show medical vaccination card aka private medical health info aka HIPPA complications. I’m vaccinated got moderna however also don’t need walking around “papers” get establishment seems anti American me. CDC guidance regarding schools impacted many political interests trying get schools opened long teachers union piped keep closed. know many households sending kids private schools open full time public schools not. reasoning two parent working households. Without baby sitter, even working home difficult kids running around. people called representatives demanding push schools open contributed money lobbying campaigns pushing same. coworkers started making fuss early last October, vaccine even out.

I remember February several political analysts predicting Biden get public schools open next couple months, would lose lot political support go political pursuits get bills passed. shortly CDC changed guidance dime regarding schools. new guidance kids kept 3 ft apart closed unventilated spaces classrooms, qualifies safe environment. needed there's enough room classroom maintain 6 ft separation kids. rather telling fast CDC rolled position Biden administration said would push schools open.

My point lot CDC's messaging guidance driven economic impact societal needs. cant justifiably single teachers union speaking teachers' defense without also recognizing interests pushing schools open long even passably safe kids teachers. Holy shit, we're actually end-game we... want hope want hurt again. mean, *hope* right, understand confident based facts hand.

Like I've said elsewhere thread, math pencil herd immunity places vaccinations lagging 15%+ unless start making lot really big leaps evidence supporting them. *ruined point used think I'll feel better life gets moving really doubt thought cases communities extensively vaccinated already. could wrong. It’s essentially US. couple weeks intents purposes don’t see upcoming semester wouldn’t normal. everyone fully vaccinated, restrictions unnecessary.  antibody studies I've seen support idea real cases outstrip tested cases 4-5x.  Yes it’s pretty safe. Especially given cases almost everywhere. fun opinion problem south Asia lack access masks face shields.

Or / people there, use them, maybe. lot moms also alcoholics don’t view it. drinking several glasses wine day newsflash. Terrified, next question.  put disclaimer article claiming super duper variants going take us ""bAcK SqUaRe OnE"" think walk ins definitely helping. Hopefully start level get good 60-70 percent done winter months low end states 50-60 high end states 70-80 far none. Covid never going away. can’t wear masks forever fear vaccine resistant variant might pop up.  countries similar US though opening everyone vulnerable vaccinated. moving age increments 10 years we'll eventually reach point young people get too. would wearing mask serve example people may gotten vaccine yet want to?

For US, people gotten vaccinated suddenly change behavior someone wearing mask. Covid-19 vaccines bigger side effects populations eat alot seafood? Remember Nordic covid-19 vaccine reactions? Fair point. didn’t southern holiday bump radar. Hey atleast they're protesting protect people. America protest covid measures even though kill people. Well straight horror movie tier stuff. “I’m sorry hear Dave. I’ve included advice proceed writing bottom 7 mile long receipt. Good luck finding nice day!” So, might lost mine. 😢

It arounds somewhere, I'm worried got lost papers tossed. got 4x3 plastic card holders put gun safe important documents. Okay let’s get serious look real numbers matter:DEATHS. many people dying time last year vs now.  assumption wrong. Vaccines combined natural immunity make year vastly different last. relatively normal Fall semester point, suspicion school run actual troop monkeys intensify. Alone car someone going pick someone else shortly. get rides people live appreciate wear mask way come get even I'm car. However see point. another person said, Japan's bureaucracy severe, doctors/nurses administer vaccines, types medical staff moderna trials also 250 microgram dose. So, getting 180 micrograms harmful. bit inflammation. Many sufferers forced eyes surgically removed surgeons work stop infection reaching brain.

Yikes.  Yeah we’re talking cases areas people either didn’t believe covid didn’t follow guidelines, wouldn’t think would even half? 

I’m also assuming that’s getting mentioned Deep South (Covid deniers, anti-vax, etc). You’re talking group people ignoring restrictions already suddenly whole new crop infections later, wouldn’t already affected way already ignoring guidelines/denying covid even exists? Shouldn’t good majority already infected?  we've locked year now. Patience wearing thin especially Vaccinations becoming commonplace. What's big deal us living lives odds non-vaccinated falling seriously ill dying next zero want able take lives hands instead mandated follow rules make 5% people's feelings get hurt?

If want mask up/shelter place/etc 2025, means right hope that's makes happy. saying need tell live life, need wear mask somehow selfish wanting live life incredibly self centered part. 

No one saying can't continue want order feel safe, please understand fully Vaccinated person like nearly zero threat virus spreading wants go back life knew COVID. Cool literally never over. Sure, original point there's lot variation throughout country. really matter many people vaccinated Milwaukee I'm Mobile.

Honestly, numbers matter probably even local that. could probably pretty predictive county-to-county level, although obviously things like luck demographics comes play pretty heavily start talking specific area. Unlike countries, Japan place they’d think letting anyone turn time - that’s far random. assign every person residency “ticket” individual name, organize time slot designated location, get vaccinated, probably registered system vaccinated, etc. imagine, quite feat takes time organize.

To note, Minnesota this, least state ran vaccines. ended getting mine pharmacy, there's still system going government ran events. Dollars doughnuts, NPR carrying advertisement masquerading news story part quid-pro-quo deal CVS CVS greased NPR's palm. vaccines anti-depressants everyone! interesting know someone died two days getting covid, already comfort measures symptoms counted covid death. family member mine think US got hundreds millions doses vaccines people accident? Give credit credit due, vaccine rollout extremely well organized Interesting, thanks. often think japan highly technological country tend forget many facets this. we're fairly advanced many fronts still lag many elsewhere, e-commerce glaring issue right now. Tons business transactional website even website all. However, positive aspect covid gave swift kick ass lagging behind. USA update first dose shots:

Nice increase last week general trend reducing 7 day average reveresed!

This increase/decrease first doses previous week last week:

Tuesday -51.81%

Wednesday: -29%

Thursday: -18.28%

Friday: -13.33%

Saturday: -33.15%

Sunday: -0.79%

Monday: 49.34%

A clear trend good! Think u read news misinformed , govt already given proposal deferral rule 1.5 years 667 people day (7 day moving average) mindblowlingly high numbers basically stable since start april. wanting rain parade seems like Australia quite rush reopen borders, even vaccine passports likes. Maybe distant future allowed come Germany 

I really sorry hear history, seems everything could happen bad happened. “study” merely asks people vague question doesn’t tell anyone shit. put way much stock this. one study put willing wear months longer ensure pandemic ends. question wasn’t phrased way. know could posed question got exact opposite result say study proves.

Precautionary principle. Get familiar it. New York like 25 lists (I may may exagerrating, vaccine end Feb), state, city, ""leftover vaccine availability"" lists, facility lists distinct hospital, insurance lists... nuts. accurate. last time saw number highest cause death among police officers 2020, next highest cause even close. Yeah, tough crowd guess. bad considering majority doses come ""quasi"" effective vaccine eh? latest study suggests good write produced, obviously bunch plants around world same. necessarily. I'm fully immune (one week!) gonna go eat restaurant. takeout since last March despite state making extremely irresponsible move allowing indoor dining many months ago. Speaking potential side effects, normal EXTREME fatigue 5+ days getting 2nd dose Pfizer? 

I've brutal tiredness since Saturday Sunday morning. Got 2nd dose last Wednesday. Yes, seen that. question is, objectively better never get sick cold flu never see anyone's face ever again? crazy think back beginning pandemic entire United States capability test process several thousand cases day. remember Governor Illinois getting television excited managed test thousand people one day. process hundreds thousands per state everyday. free clear stores mask required signs stores mask recommended signs. wear mask circumstances even though there’s risk kicked later. things caused someone something *deliberately* you. (That's why, reason, may illegal purposefully infect someone disease, e.g. HIV.). 

There right free germs. was, everyone would stay home indefinitely. go anywhere, even mask on, there's chance might touch something someone else subsequently touches, catches communicable disease me. countries Europe (not all) extremely strict age based priority system, means youngest are, later get vaccine, even reach point risk groups entirely covered. trying make joke? serious? thought one CEOs said would need 6-12 months.

The CEO company makes literally *billions* every time manage sell booster? prizes guessing estimate many booster shots needed absurdly high. 
 
This really need saying, trust scientists, CEOs trying please shareholders. Well yes, pretty common phrase use since believe god. Either way remains fact lucky say anything major going on. It’s stuff like bugs hell regards people acting like vaccinations way get herd immunity (and I’m talking person initially responded here). first time I’m reading specifically mentioned feel like time vax rates get brought people lose minds bc “muh herd immunity!” natural immunity vaccinations, feel like we’re lot closer want consider.  clue Japanese government didn’t deal except immigration Fussa. wife sit one time gadget machine working check us in. done manually. Obviously guest country waiting OK. went Japan many times via Space Fussa (I’m retired military) luggage search inconsistent. Sometimes thoroughly sometimes all. got thorough search Australian grocery store! point officers exercised search iron discretion, procedure. 
Off topic California lawyer (in law) family refuse get vaccinated wear mask. wife masker hesitant get vaccine finally did. mother suspicious now. point educated (lawyer wife’s brother (98% sat score)) anti …), clue human behavior. Japanese immigration countries exercise broad flexibility experience. Highly educated US individuals high IQ individuals anti vaccine. personal experience people. could isolated incidents. right. sure getting at. far evidence suggests need reformulated vaccine. Even problematic strains seem handled ""cushion"" allotted vaccine. start seeing trend breakthrough cases, might change. good ready if/when happens, moment nothing tells us need something differently. bit amusing hearing person apparently spends time reddit discussing UFO conspiracies. legal one right attend college. 

beyond that, people really care distinction emergency use full approval conservative lunatics. actual authorities this, scientists, view concern. vaccine symptoms magically appear 6+ months later already know possible side effects are. Yeah definitely experience. partner's armpit node still hurts really bad days second Pfizer dose. probably pretty mad it. 
But olympic comitate say ""you can't call Olympics 2021"" like lot.

Sure, could host 2022, could call 75%er here. knew last year would give socializing 15 months, would gone contracted COVID deliberately. data London outcompeting B117 agree although original deal Merckx Merckx could guarantee uk based production British government pushed Oxford choose uk based firm. GSK declined offer already working sanofi comes AZ never vaccine overestimated capacity didn’t fully disclose reasons could fulfill contract EU poster wrong, like many others shit show thread.

There spectators, week limited Japanese citizens exceptions. Depends, ICUs full old high risk people (don’t underestimate obesity US, plenty 30s-40s died covid weight), can’t treat younger people injured car accident. known cases people dying route ICUs peak Texas ICUs available areas. Quite lot cases. USA. really valid, science denial effectiveness vaccines. Fully vaccinated people deny science keep social distancing masking, they're stupid advocate policy keeping mask social distance mandates things like capacity restrictions. chance mutant full immune escape pretty freaking low complement it, I'd also recommend book Fifth Risk. certain people purposefully make government less beneficial us little known agencies.  country firefighters administer vaccines ? Thanks, do. get 30 million deaths number from?? That's almost 10% country! I've seen estimates argue 900,000-1,000,000 deaths covid may closer 560,000 number often used. one arguing US literally decimated. will, we've total isolation getting first shots, I'm sure would've caught covid.  I'm windows vulnerable people (older ill) first along healthcare workers. people bit younger work high risk infection jobs education. line appointments like described.

However, also live republican area based experience people talk to, would guess half population flat refuses get vaccinated assortment reasons. So, many vaccination stations, including work, opened anyone show get it. We've started getting less less shots since almost nobody shows anymore.

Basically, we're fucked.  Common ancestor  progenitor viral genome three bases differ Wuhan strains. researchers think Wuhan earliest genomes sampled actually variants progenitor coronavirus (CoV), diverged ν α lineages.   pre-existing earliest case  Wuhan strain underwent three consecutive mutations, α1, α2, α3, found closely related CoVs, base three positions. ν variants progenitor CoV show 47 variants positions, making unlikely ancestral lineage Wuhan-1 virus early samples. first ν mutant picked almost two months Wuhan-1 strain.  multiple occurrences progenitor CoV, China USA, January 2020 onwards.

We obviously know many animals died covid since start pandemic cause would examine every single dead animal span.  Can't wait Japan sites state level. It’s city level organize system.

Oof, that's rough. great deal sympathy, then. organized chaos

America's specialty. I've heard America's armed forces described way. Concerning intensify... Japan wtf? Put vaccines vending machines something Modi Indian Trump. 1.3 billion people losing lot people covid big deal them. vaccine significantly affected alcohol consumption, would reflected real-world data. data shows vaccine effective everyone except immunocompromised old. original paper. new one address critics issues. good. reason U.K. 0 today Wales reported 4 quite possibly backlog doesn’t make much sense England 0 Wales 4 England 10x size Wales lowest infection rate lot.  Although think need studies confounding variable huge religious festivals political rallies India last 2 months, high population density. Wrong. indeed spectators. limited Japanese citizens, regardless vax status.  Bruh, heard South Koreans' relationships fans? Everyone last week spreading false notions absolutely impossible! 

Not could factories making gawsh dawrn complicated product (despite pfizer moderna continually contracting new facilities), even facilities opened, absolutly 0 supplies make vaccines. world supposedly 100% capacity! 

The question keep seeing BS talking points come regards lifting IP? Yes will. different state, county/city part walk appointments across country. people less hesitancy area longer took get get there. got mine still appointments, 2nd shot walk availability. walk wherever around here.

Also, USA peeps.. free. dont need insurance. Check local grocery store see get one next time go get groceries. know peeps busy healthcare scary experience, isnt one times. know. moving Florida early July I'm thankful. 4th July celebrations currently live already started getting canceled again. data far seems show vaccines work preventing severe disease. transmissible that's problem 👀😂😂 Yup. end day left last vial.

Got it. mistake. expecting 12-15 EUA today, hopefully tomorrow? sooner better time US military bases Japan always get flak misbehaving service people play 4D chess, open doors locals, provide vaccines anyone arrives. right one thing. 

You expert Japanese society. virus attaches human receptors. think there's single virus infects animal life.


Also one virus one animal affects another animal differently. already posted Reposts removed. sure would stop culture 80% officers truplets. I’m thrilled willingness sacrifice lives many refuse get vaccinated! basic way vaccines work (mRNA coding spike protein lipid nanoparticles) same, think dosage additives might different though. Yes. one trust one expert. You’re read many many many expert opinions, studies, look backgrounds methodologies coming conclusions...and even become conclusively convinced evidence overwhelming (for example, COVID airborne obvious six months this, yet still experts talking six feet)

Your wording matters. Flat saying don’t like experts implies don’t trust anyone background topic studied. There’s scientific evidence shows anti maskers covid deniers “naturally immune” default. definition low density areas? think onto something. ICU local hospital see single dead animal. Maybe I'm completely wrong, feels like countries handled COVID pandemic better racing vaccination much countries whose COVID hit really badly.


Even though Brazil anti-vax president refused buy vaccines several times, fully vaccinated 7% 220 million inhabitants. hey, we've registered 442k COVID deaths since pandemic started, may explain (rightly) rush. Japan sites state level. It’s city level organize system. yes, you’re wrong. However - Japan also known easy-to-use websites. thought washing fruits veggies soap bad, use cold water? 

“Washing fruits vegetables soap, detergent, commercial produce wash recommended”

Source: government wants Olympics. people not. government limiting tickets Japanese citizens, largely want them, cancelling international tickets, stupid xenophobic. tell organized forward thinking govt is. flew two weeks second Pfizer, coming someone teetered edge COVID cautious/COVID paranoid, felt totally fine. 

Assuming US, option masks - required airports planes. right goes LONG way towards helping prevent transmission. 

I flew Delta - handed single packaged antibacterial wipe soon stepped board. quickly wiped area around me, definitely go every nook cranny. one thing, know COVID really spread surfaces, another, felt protected since fully vaccinated. Also, planes looked extremely clean, definitely much cleaner ever times, like licking tray table anything... 

Here's nickel's worth free advice - make point go things world get plane. Go stores walk around. Eat restaurant - comfortable eating indoors yet, find patio least appetizer drink something. 

Given post, making guess still keeping much home - that's okay, vaccinated. going HUGE mental leap go level isolation/staying home going airports planes, highly recommend dip toe back world trying it. interesting use Greek word like lot languages. Show yourselves, internet rabble. challenge duel got second dose Pfizer vaccine 3 days ago lymphatic node armpit swollen painful two days now. It’s really pissing off. Anyone else side effect? viewers ""fatigue""

They'll get much less attention (and viewers, aka sponsors, aka money)

So dead set maximize it.

The olympic comitate does.not lose money tokyo olympics physical.spectators, japanese government business  Upvote edit. Breathed nose. Sigh. every disease = every person, symptoms vary. even aminal side. Moderna Pfizer basically clones outside lipid nanoparticle (Moderna uses MIT derived LNP, Pfizer uses LNP Canadian company linked University British Columbia.) would absolutely shocked results within margin error. Korea- police officers suing govt implementing mandatory vaccine requirement. 

AZ good enough say. want Pfizer... incredibly disappointing! Pfizer tested symptomatic cases trial. participant felt sick tested Covid. felt okay tested. AZ tested every participant weekly order find symptomatic asymptomatic cases. test result included people caught Covid never got sick Pfizers not. one reasons officials kept saying vaccinated people wear masks. originally know well Pfizer would prevent asymptomatic cases since test those. believe real world date shows effective asymptomatic cases though. really doubt we're going get another mask mandate fall. We'll vaccinating people summer point, going hard convince vaccinated people wear masks protect people refusing protect themselves.  Mand. Even Brazil fucking disaster % people vaccinated... mom got shot last friday! really dont understand situation Japan. Cool.

CDC BioNTech. stuff getting canceled summer around Im starting get really pissed it. Especially outdoor stuff.

Same. Various outdoor fairs festivals cases histories going back decades, last year first time ever canceled they're canceling again. Many events July August canceled now. Why? Certainly based science. live state one highest vaccination rates new cases deaths absolutely crater last couple months. Yeah, slice Texas it’s place. Big box places still requiring masks, small biz crapshoot. require it, don’t, it’s always clear what’s going latter. Like went Braum’s day signage stating masks required, maybe half customers didn’t wear one ordering, employees still wore theirs. yesterday went cafe didn’t signage, donned one habit walked none staff wearing one. began well asked required said nah, took mine off. know least one fully vaccinated (she’s friend) reckon chose require more. yeah getting really confused booster shot talks far tell there's evidence support would needed. think maybe people proactive saying ""yeah needed could come something"" Interesting. 

I'm Canadian made easy. Massive public health immunization centres 10s thousands day, book time online. accessibility issues, every local pharmacy supply without appointment. matter cases variants? reported 2000 3000 cases covid state yesterday. hospitals fine. death rate continues decrease. feels like attempt make Florida look bad...but focusing statistic. Well, like us recently. symptoms? short ago, gf blurry vision numb face left side, doc said migraine recommended blood test. know tf thinking, talking US, Japan. ignore me. mental health impacted pandemic. went up. 

Not fucking hard understand. Still sad missed 202 dollar flights. It’s laissez faire US. 

I signed volunteer could get vaccine early state (younger, already caught Covid work heard vaccine might help long haul symptoms).

Was held church interestingly enough, slow enough could call mom couple friends dropped in, signed up, got shots spot problemo.

I think little bit “organized chaos” may aid expediting distribution vaccine. get I'm still surprised challenge country like Japan. Japan's populace strange pseudoscientific interest blood specifically. there's whole astrology-type system based around blood-type there. absurd nonsense, *many* people take seriously, *much* expect modern high-tech country really coin toss, given vaccinated individuals feel safer going back normal, likely go eat.

In addition, unvaccinated care risk also likely naturally immune point due misadventure earlier pandemic. posted details thoughts really hope I'm wrong. Every single time appointment systems opened, they’ve quickly inundated often driven offline amounts DDoS attack people trying access websites make booking flooding call centers well. Nobody yet made system withstood initial onslaught.

That sounds like Austin Public Health doing. ""You sign vaccines Tuesday night 6pm-10pm."" million people trying log time. Eventually got smart left signup page available basically week realizing excess vaccine doses available used. literally gambling side worst odds, incredibly dumb. necessarily, there's walk events try reach disadvantaged groups often done pharmacy, employer, etc. qualified, got mine grocery store booking third party site. Oh yeah, point large grocery chains let walk get shot, like flu vaccine kind! Yes! 3.5-4 weeks post 2nd vaccine stopped chills fatigue. felt like coming grey cloud. normal I'll ever now! Thanks checking! Japan give huge fuck potential revenue don’t even want cares lol equivalent comparison. currently opinion also. why:

* COVID shown able spread house pets mammals (mink etc.) also shown able spread back humans.

* Sometimes people previously COVID get re-infected antibodies may good ~6 months.

* said people vaccinated need booster within 12 months many already skipped 2nd shot.

* Though people vaccinated unlikely get severely ill still potentially asymptomatic carries. 

* Many anti-vaxxers get vaccinated order achieve herd immunity would need ~80 vaccinated may get there.

* far mutations still seem covered existing vaccines long? COVID seems quickly mutate ability move species increases lilelyhood see mutation covered existing vaccines. 

* many countries world significant pressing issues may take COVID vaccines seriously need everyone vaccinated make COVID go away entirely.

So seems likely human non-human vehicles COVID remain existence long time time mutations could allow spread vaccinated people.

Add geo-political regional issues like many countries limited access vaccines, vaccines areas generally bad comparison ones us, patent issues around various vaccine technologies etc. etc. ... 

There laundry list reasons believe COVID simply disappear. likely still way long I'm dirt. asking since vaccinated March would want turning international hub pandemic.

They already said allow foreign spectators. would athletes/coaches/etc current residents Japan spectating. Japan still currently allowing age 65+ certain professions like medical professionals phases newly eligible people sign various online portals. nowadays much supply we've started accepting walk-ins locations It’s really interesting (and semi frustrating) see countries different groups people react vaccine. would never guessed Japan would incredibly hesitant. guess past history vaccines isnt much data yet. common sense says yes, safe fully vaccinated people public indoor spaces without mask...not totally without risk 100% safe, well within acceptable ranges risk deal concerning diseases. 

but cdc public health officials not, not, make statements based anything solid data evidence(ideally), larger body evidence, public health officials general go cautious approach. know handful people receive vaccines. one said, ""I wish could force everyone get vaccine."" See film Shin Godzilla: “In film, politicians struggle bureaucratic red tape order deal sudden appearance giant monster evolves whenever attacked.” speaking contamination issue- it’s bush league f—k Part 25% too. close family friends bunker mentality. We've never eaten even year - even outdoors. ate restaurant (and outdoors that) first time year Sunday Mother's Day us vaccinated. Shopping person kept absolute minimum. consider fortunate able WFH.

I guess like attracts like, close family friends share similar mentality, us seem fine. isn’t true, even were, lifting restrictions areas 60+% adults vaccinated comparable September 2020. jury — vaccines work.

You correct messaging. See section two here: guy good long reply, I'm gonna drop backup experience pharmaceutical chemist. Japanese pharmacopeia, (read 700 page testing manual) places accept US pharmacopeia European pharmacopeia instead making/enforcing own. Japan requires higher standards usually despite pharmacopeia updating every 5 years opposed US EU ones updating 3/4 times year.

Hell one favorite bars $2.50 Gennys (this tell city live google lol) Saturdays. It’s honestly weird many cities/states completely disregarding CDC guidelines comes easing restrictions. located exact thing. graph doesnt include 12k mentioned article. there's data discrepancy somewhere. Oh no, didnt know Jigglypuff here. Pfizer   third population received one two vaccine shots.

1.2m vaccinations per day, currently, fast enough vaccinate 84 million citizens. I'm 13 parents signed summer camp, (Pre-Covid loved camp). I'm exited going shitty. Japan. From[ Time reasons Japan’s low immunization rate complex reflected across Asia-Pacific region, **many nations controlled pandemic best falling behind race vaccinate**, potentially undoing early gains stalling economic recoveries. New Zealand also less 1% people vaccinated. Australia South Korea fare little better 3%. compares 48% U.K. 25% U.S.

Note: percentages last month numbers current. Reasoning statistics like always questionable, sidesteps question significance altogether.

Sure, I'm likely get winning lottery ticket buy 50 time, chance infinitesimal first place increased chance really matter. Probably wait staff. shit makes sense. food service fucking doctors. Feeling like playing russian roulette every time go grocery store great mental health... Yes no. remove holiday weekends surrounding data instability (Labor Day, Memorial Day, 4th July), CDC 7-day average cases deaths lowest since June.

Cases probably lowest they've since start pandemic. testing 20-30% fall double summer. top fact 7-day average would lot drop even cases hold steady next several days.

Unless Mother's Day outsized impact, looks like cases collapsing speak. Hospitalizations new hospitalizations declining, albeit slower (down 11 percent week week still back early October levels). I'm pretty sure 70% include kids “And original journal submission? “They rejected it,” Jaenisch says.”

That paper seriously criticized scientists. Read article, headline. mean, yeah, they’re wrong.

You ashamed yourself, honestly. Preaching choir mate, I've long time lived this.

The government response even fucked usual - extremely pissed started saying vaccine rollout slow enough vaccine distribute, clearly line information coming Pfizer EU vaccine exports, pretty soon shown massive lie just... nothing. usual.

For example think country many earthquakes earthquake disaster response well right? Well... exactly - taken decades bad results small improvements get now, even issues.  online petition 300k votes? wow almost 0,25% entire japan population! Taking Pandemic Seriously. people can't vaccinate due health reasons vulnerable would really appreciate healthy people vaccinate, vaccinating. Sleeper trains... 1. mRNA vaccines target spike protein.

2. spike protein needs fit human ACE2 receptors infect people.

3. Human ACE2 receptors going change.

4. spike protein can't mutate *that* much, virus infectious.

5. Ergo, mRNA vaccines remain reasonably effective quite time, despite variants appearing. It’s hard *most places* get vaccinated. Seems americans bubble unaware rest world. surprise /s  Stupid people deserve protected deadly viruses, too. kind weird still trying year.

I surprised learn were, assumed would Olympics next year (when everyone mostly back normal) we'd resume staggering afterward. Ive seen Europeans accuse Americans vaccine nationalism (I care downvotes, bring it.)

If underestimate efficacy vaccines face increasing evidence understandable get downvoted. baseless assumption. Side effects vary individual, indication affected age. supposed keep society like indefinitely sake one person? That's run society unfortunately, good majority overrules interests extreme minority. Also 50% efficacy friend discrete probability two distinct outcomes protected not. gradient every bit middle incurs greater immunity. much nicer headline ""OMG vaccines dropped 2 million shots day we're effed"" one. get saying TON Europeans accusing US vaccine nationalism Social conservatism identity politics hallmarks recent American right I’ve never known trend Japan, outside fringe groups.

Holy fuck, it’s high? Fear mongering. Sometimes like Fauci times think way strict predictions. People play Plague Inc. glad Olympics happen. 

I wonder Plague Inc. like over. addition reasons here, deaths reported medical examiner determines cause death issues death certificate, necessarily happen day death. adds bit lag. should. Vaccinated people exposed getting sick thus getting tested. Hospitalizations showing people getting sick numbers last winter. I’d imagine hope testing continues decline. test people aren’t sick aren’t reasonable risk getting sick even exposed. mask mandate rescinded? people still socially distancing? voices head say they've fine.

Right convinced, turns get office, changed back decided get vaccinated. Well, see, authoritarian strong man helps ease raging daddy issues, whereas masks not.  showed COVID-19 cases vaccinated single dose either Pfizer-BioNTech AstraZeneca vaccines similar levels protection mortality single dose, 44% 55% respectively, compared unvaccinated cases.

I thought interesting. AZ better preventing shuffling mortal coils get infected, Pfizer better stopping getting infected first place, end wash. one dose anyway.

Which confirms whole stack data points AZ better cellular response, Pfizer better antibody response. MRNA vaccines gold standard right now, variant ever escape, might grateful ""second class"" vaccines, given T-Cell immunity seems resilient new strains. business two months shutdown crazy stressful things turned around we’ve best year ever. 

I’ve also watched others handled pandemic made reassess life live work others. 

I’ve better outlook life ever. I’d honestly say pandemic good overall mental health I’ve able let go lot unhelpful ways thinking.  That's norm least. 75% adults least 1 dose. bear mind reason infections holding steady instead continually dropping Indian variant - accounts new infections London last week Lol Maybe I'm missing something many people laminating buying sleeves vaccine cards? used de facto vaccine passports states? provided xerox employer that, went safe. can't think scenarios I'll need outside showing doctor make sure entered medical file. surprises me. Good luck! realize ""flu"" shots degree speculative SARS-CoV-2 vaccines targeted active virus? get paid upfront 4x doses deliver 1x promised, price per delivered dose then? Japan seemed well controlling virus, failing vaccinating public. latter much different countries. That's indeed weird concerning There's huge rural/urban divide. city Texas 100% mask compliance (granted, masks required every store), take short drive sticks, mask compliance plummets. you? get tested? Mississippi is, right second, fully open, without restrictions, masks, infection rate, deaths, hospitalizations falling steadily rapidly.

The assumption herd immunity necessary anything divorced reality going right second. “But Alabama!” They’re fully open too. states people worried won’t get full herd immunity don’t care wide open operating normal. Infections continue drop. case, wonder 3' rule way actively punish vaccinated? definitely odd way handling things.  Yes say vaccines provide immunity virus, turn makes immune, know it’s pretty complicated concept. 

Is true isn’t 100% effective? Yes, nothing 100% effective, 90-95% effective preventing infections, it’s hell lot effective intervention (even masks!) people get breakthrough infections likely mild illness fine. 

Once intervention like vaccines effective, get rid restrictions infections deaths go down. 

If want live world permanent masks social distancing, guest stay home. Vaccines get us pandemic return normal. Well reads optimistic
To me. hope right. Yes, try find place also giving Moderna. Japan confuses me..

What form government? capitalist something else? it? CDC us 7 day average 2 million, peak 3.3 million.    husband live US, New Jersey.

We currently applying citizenship social security number drivers license. form ID expired passport 

What sort identification required vaccinated? seems like there's finally messaging getting vaccine readily available area, even walk ups. recently week two ago still messages saying ""get vaccine turn,"" despite vaccines opened reasonably easy find. help vaccinate people closely following news want can't spend time transport get distant vaccine sites. consider we'd vaccinating 3-4 million day we're still 46% eligible population receive dose. 

I care what's happening nationally, though. care what's happening \~75 mile radius near me. what's happening near demand dwindling anyone get appointment almost entirely day. said, I'm 2-3 weeks losing patience unless demand picks back up. idea complicated extreme. relies idea would enough political interest capital close borders vaccinated country.

In NZ example would big issue legally bill rights. pandemic management clauses allow temporary suspension them, can’t see could avoid overturned ministry health lifts pandemic risk due vaccinations. Essentially government would choose revoke BOR, one going protect bunch antivaxxers.

I agree sentiment countries like Aus/NZ different set issues address road end this. idea countries become North Korea cannot countenance occasional flare ups COVID amongst anti vax groups doesn’t reflect attitudes either country. vast majority take vaccine consider don’t foolish, won’t accept closed borders open globe, political non starter.  No, would buy ""pod"" seats, likely 2 4 would put seat you.

Whatcha gonna do? Make dreams come true!  laugh want, science question solid: vaccines dramatically cut transmission, reduce symptoms. shown monitoring health care workers periodic testing observing vaccinated ones even get infected time. say initial trials testing trial participants every days. never disagreement whether everyone really wanted vaccine gotten first does. disagreement whether means screwed not, claiming. Considering big group Americans willing get one yet, fact everyone really wanted one already gotten one dose mean screwed. They're sane people. They're new Yorkers Oh, ok sacrificing knows many people covid good reason, ok. not. members party sit apart like that? *international* spectators. mean Japanese spectators.  point nobody sane going want get vaccine within view homeless man painting wall feces.  Yeah - pfizer pushing bit current contracts Kalamazoo Mexico/Canada (I'm Canadian).

AFAIK *just* 3 million doses week right now.

What's far interesting (in selfish way sure) US starts exporting stockpile lets pfizer/moderna export serious amount doses.

Like end month, ~70-80% eligible Canadians first dose (excluding 12-15 Health Canada approved for). US could export one week's worth supply that's enough everyone second dose asap - economically boon US considering #1 export partner. ....We already nearing 50 60% overall immune immunity past infections robust - years worth study more. 90% get first shot get second. Base information data fear. Like said, immunity even 1 shot quite good weeks. 

I'm saying ""over"" I'm correcting drastic misinformation testing like 30% less national averages. 50% less areas. 

It's likely even significant data fully shows. Get tested? correlation = causation today, 42% people Ontario received least one shot, Québec 44%. around 65% end May. 

Don't worry, probably able come even August! wouldn’t. People 20’s 30’s mild illness concern. think nearly every summer event cancelled am, fall events starting get cancelled well.

Normal summer ass. Sounds like think symptoms? Go get tested. positive use pressure rest family get tested. yet people inhale air time without issue. don’t think needle that’s exposed 10 seconds going lead sepsis. keep mine safe. can't think reason I'd need carry around. That’s bit different too. 

Driving privilege, right. always heavily regulated licensed. Deaths also trailing indicator, peak positive cases first week January peak deaths last week. 40% decline infections 3-4 weeks ago today manifest 30-40% reduction deaths end May somewhere around ~400. hopefully threat, glad want make sure. Gave lot alone time think work myself. bad middle pandemic mentally feel better giving lot time figure myself. sound smart started Pfizer month earlier, early December. extend dosage interval January. 391k Pfizer 2nd jabs 10th Jan. 5 months ago, decent data. Everything undercounted. Deaths, cases. it. every country. can’t possibly kept accurate count. that’s ok, figures still show devastation across planet.

Where ever write masks effective Covid-19 vaccine...? Yeah np. Immune system is... Complex say least. that's kinda big picture way understanding Money spent Olympics always drain. question whose money spent, profits.  Hell giving basketball games. people dying usually ICU many weeks, delay. somewhat hard tell cases plummeting seasonality vaccines.

Obviously it’s bit both.

It interesting next fall see things go.  

My gut tells we’re going get spot couple hundred cases per state per day summer.

I interested see stays way fall winter.  Well, get sick regularly, perhaps might consider first foremost getting annual flu shot.

Personally much avoid occasional sickness. eat uncoocked seafood hamburgers medium-rare, example, accepting small risk worth it. say every new variant. think vastly overestimating number people fall bucket describing. certainly people listen unquestioningly whatever perceived ""leaders"" say, isolated phenomenon exclusive particular subset population. first step transcending boundaries creating hesitancy surrounding vaccines recognize people independent thought belief rest us bunch brainwashed clones whatever pastor Senator commands, that's complete strawman going lead us miss actual influences. fact believe people opposed minimum wages extensive welfare simply that's Mr. Politician told think shows serious lack critical thought understanding part. exact sort bastardization people opposing views lead entire divisive mess first place. Yay 😀❤️ jurisdictions, anyone dies COVID gets counted. It’s fairly negligible number deaths. Cook County provides unparalleled transparency COVID deaths. data, less .5 percent people COVID death records died clear non-COVID causes (accidents, falls, drug overdoses).

Did miss something here? He's saying long people keep getting vaccinated start easing indoor masking up. Maybe missed could show says stop wearing masks right now?

I'm re-opening, vaccination numbers rise we'll point masks necessary. We're point. couple weeks shed oppressive piece cloth, worry. Wow shitshow...you always think Japan organized orderly It’s realistic use per capita, without, 241 reported yesterday country 331 million. UK 20% US population.

Deaths last lagging indicator really start drop significantly soon UK Israel indication. Canada's closer 43% today. going fast another important reason - doctors nurses may give shot. Paramedics, firemen, dentists, etc, unable administer it. understanding doctors nurses would need “donate” time administer doses amounts almost minimum wage doctor. They’re trying allow dentists administer vaccine too, believe they’re still discussions.

""We'll lucky 50% country vaxxed"" literally opinion fact. ridiculous making statements like assuming they're factual 'seem right' you. Gain perspective, please.

People wander sub ask basic clarifying questions state/federal guidance get wild misinformation back directly contradicts CDC somehow okay? finally gave subreddit altogether getting minor argument someone rarity fomite transmission lol.

Treat anti-vaxxers. Nuance dead hail absolutism. virus continue mutate theres unvaxxed people wearing masks. scientific fact. vaccines work currently known variants isnt say always case. That's theres multiple flu vaccines theres significantly different ones vaccine must change. may case now, that's say couldnt changs theres spread mutations. two month long superspreader events - elections kumbh always runs deep, risk turning every thread seminar go deep. spring fall, I've found masks help allergies I'm gonna keep wearing masks winter even covid magically disappear face Earth tomorrow, I'd rather get colds flu help it.

However, vaccines effective real-world practical effects vaccinated extremely miniscule.

Like scientifically speaking, person hit 5 bullets torso much less harmed somebody hit 50 bullets torso. people (shot 5 times vs shot 50 times) probably dead practical terms real world matter.

So yeah... wowee zappo goes scary variants evading vaccinated immune system lot normal coronavirus does, 100% true lie... still gets defeated end, almost exact % effectiveness.  think interest increase border reopening date announced? mean, point, international tourists Australia anyone vaccinated playing fire. believe anything else even likely would pretty antiscience well.

With roughly 8,000 deaths per day pre-pandemic, that’s 2.9M deaths per year without covid. 3.4M deaths, ~500k covid deaths accurate. 900k article mentions isn’t even realistically possible unless saw death toll like 3.7M+ honestly (even overlap deaths died versus covid).

- zero side effects
- requirement second shot problem ""there evidence adaptation \[...\] necessary"" is: necessary what? prevent vaccinated people dying? reach global herd immunity suppress covid transmission?

The efficacy BioNTech's vaccine variants still pretty good.

However, everyone world get vaccine (vaccine hesitancy + access). 60% population vaccinated, I'd rather vaccine stopping 85-90% transmission 60-70%.

We already see importance better vaccines: Seychelles Maldives [have vaccinated greater population Israel. mix Sinopharm Astrazeneca. Cases increased recently Seychelles Maldives. infection statistics [are coherent phase 3 efficacies vaccines reduce death toll sure, prevent significant waves.

If new variants keep coming, BioNTech's vaccine might look like Sinopharm/Astrazeneca today: good vaccines, preventing lots deaths, good enough prevent new waves (even vaccinating people). Really? That’s reaction? “they said every single one variants, maybe wait panicking?” oops. Cards. Edited. miss it, phrase right based memory.

Last summer low 18k June. break get new cases lowest they've since March 2020, things really start changing. Thanks explaining simply. Going data knowing Indiana... tracks. Read actually WROTE, ""thought implied""...

Otherwise, ""implying"" fully vaccinated Covid-19 Ward Staff thereafter required wear face masks PPE. trying get vaccines Europe?

Can't generalize whole Europe. common thing EU countries vaccines bought countries common EU treaty, country gets proportional share vaccines whole batch bought EU. distributed inside country country business.

Here Estonia prioritized elderly, teachers, healthcare workers. January 80+ old eligible, 50+ old, 17th May everyone older 18 allowed. set appointment either call family doctor register national healthcare website. registered time comes, go get shot. Plus know many people called ""danger groups""/""frontline workers"" got call/mail health department saying vaccine shot already reserved them. much problems administering doses, always limited supply.

But I'd say Estonia bit exception rule - centralized online healthcare system almost citizens registered apply appointments set many years whole covid things. prepared pandemic. rate would consider alarming? people really think 75% Americans would agree anything, even obvious vaccines? now. mean, sure, don’t care outbreaks happening every year, it’s fine. jerks clearly people wear mask be.

They’d rather “Covid cases continue rise add cases other!” Sum way better avg making scary headline.  numbers Seattle vs Phoenix. handy numbers statewide, thanks. much closer. Pfizer. Fever &amp; body aches 2nd night made rough night's sleep. Woke next morning finally took acetaminophen. Went back sleep woke noon finally feeling better. Biontech, Fosun Pfizer together produce 4 billion vaccine doses starting 2022, would enough vaccinate half world population single-shot booster vaccine. 

That leave awful lot market share dozen current competitors. newcomer conquer market share, would provide substantially improved vaccine. Connecticut posted weekend numbers, 7.7 new cases per 100k weekend. 3 weeks ago averaging 30 per 100k. 

Seems like state's government timing reopening May 19 nearly perfectly. 71%+ 18+ population least 1 shot.

Let's go! sister lives Australia. Anecdotally, says nobody motivated get vaccine they've business usual long. people generally travel life normal. Many adopting ""wait see"" approach long-term impact vaccine.

In 2020 350k deaths officially attributed virus. yet calculate 500k+ deaths. 


Basically misunderstood 580k number article. included year well. personally, I'd like another year two data. partner trying become pregnant, TPTB say vaccine safe pregnant women, I'm skeptical since babies carried full term point. every unvaccinated person risk new variant could breakthrough current vaccines.

I understand, deny that's risk. fact Moderna developing booster would suggest getting vaccine would sufficient fully ameliorate risk. dose two seems fine low risk. remain way 3rd dose, 10th, live society means things greater good, one situations.

I hope think disagree premise even may disagree notion greater good unqualified supreme value. That's I'm approaching seriously thoughtfully. hospitalizations decline flat month so. 7-day average 14% last 7 Mandating crock shit. That's said worse. I’ll leave here: causes death disappeared 2020 (they didn’t), make pretty educated estimate total covid deaths, especially considering know total 3.4M deaths 2020.

Elective wear fine, like Asia wearing mask symptoms good neighbor, forcing people wear seasonally without necessary reason (like pandemic) ridiculous.  Right, people selfish, dangerously misinformed, refuse get vaccinated. fact remains vaccination, sooner, better less. (And actually, vaccines still provide *some* protection lower community spread even really different variant arises, judging previous examples this.) careful imply ""balance"" economic damage deaths. two things never comparable never be. Human lives always important, definition.


Well actually yes can. trying callous play COVID, fact society basically built balancing act economic damage death. Nearly everything risk associated it. Driving car? get accident. Going work? could get work place accident. Taking vacation? plane could crash. There's thing living risk free life. 

As society deemed risks/benefit ratios favourable. they? teach preschool. agree. 31. Sore arm first shot. Chills, fever, body aches, joint ache, headache, minor tightness arm. Chills fever cycled fever prevalent symptom 2 days fine. two weeks ago swear lingering symptoms. lol else vaccination supposed eligible able, go get vaccine reduce risk happening you!

He's likely okay. fully vaccinated still needs test. fully vaccinated guideline test symptoms ahead CT, hit 70% eligible population least one dose days ago. certainly hope there’s spike whether vaccinations pick not. Herd immunity reached combination vaccinations prior infections  specific guidelines evidence vaccine rates/variants factors involved process, give reliable information. can't speak them(obvs), they'll announce soon able. still states make decisions based recommendations.  like username. choice get covid suppose.

Call theater, vaccinated want get dead set anti-mask vaxx out. India Brazil need way though. least Wont stop trying.  sounds like don’t trust vaccines.

No, sounds like aware current understanding vaccine efficacy virus transmission rates. Please keep discussion free cowardly strawmen. Everyone 16+ able get one now,

This lie. Everyone 16+ ***eligible*** receive vaccination. June absolutely choice.  races scheduled September, October, November.

Neither change fact vaccines ***increase*** resistance COVID ***reduce*** likelihood someone become ill die ***eliminate*** chance become ill die. 

Now come back ""but number vaccinated people died COVID super low"", ignoring fact people still, large, practicing social distancing wearing masks around others. People dying streets Italy man cmon Good. Vaccines effective defense covid far, getting rid mask mandates gets people vaccinated, that’s net positive. Well pharmacy workers employees wont one providing therapy, that. find hilarious, honest. fact people actually think like . . . hope upgrading oxygen infrastructure too. doesn't, get many people fence. exactly concern kid vaccinated? won’t catch severe covid won’t spread covid I’m ass man year taught anything, people insanely suggestible. evidence needed, put shit news people parrot back like data real world tested knowledge. read article, would see CVS (or caremark, rather) employing licensed social workers therapists.


A pharmacy tech state license practice counseling couldnt legally anyway. 

Reading fundemental. disagree I've seen heard plenty restaurants put plastic barriers tables called day sit 100% 

Well, Italy India 0.0 teachers union responsible lot school guidance cdc put out. I'm disillusioned much lobbying groups effect something science based cdc. makes sense believe facts (science prevent spreading virus)over nonfactual (religion) things. virus taking host cells using replication plants make virus. 

If body stop it, well, many ACE2 receptors. I'd imagine would cause total system failure anything everywhere requires ACE2 function. nah, world wasnt bigger fumble, contest lot people died anyways. india kept following safety recommendations, things wouldve worked well enough, became next florida chance I’d that. You’ve made far. wouldn’t risk it. Cases going faster rate year things general far open time last year. Take NYC example fast dropping year compared last. Obviously vaccines effect reducing spread like US example this. UK Israel two examples.

Also want make comparisons, countries like France Germany seeing decline cases well spring goes significantly slower rate US, UK, Israel cause... got it, vaccinated many people adjusted population. That’s it. ""Mask mandates"" really helpful. lead contention. 

But guidelines excellent. Fauci undermining mask guidelines - boosting mask use. 

The outcome CDC / Fauci approach mask mandates, allowing states attack use masks - putting U.S. right back Federal government even planning PPE. Hell yeah. probably already smooch.  Transparency way. unfortunate occurred, precedent deception far far worse. You’re kind right. mutation error genetic code aren’t helpful don’t go anywhere. read there’s point “peak fitness” means mutate beneficial maintaining harmful properties much. CORRECT understand overly cautious net negative effect, guess wished reaction comments help confident science vaccines. They're also paying people get vaccinated Yeah, no...I think I'll getting psych help pharmacy tech Economic considerations exclusive saving lives. economic fallout like depression lead loss life. short sighted say economic collapse lead loss life. 

Yes exactly. need balance risk reward. That's point. bring economics discussion loss life relation economics. straight forward seperation two would implied. 

I really know plane/cars point makes. I'm saying simply getting car plane we're accepting certain level risk point address really.  Yes. meant. know public schools require vaccines attend. correlations reported trials vaccine effectiveness side effects, either direction. Sounds like political pandering get people get shot Policy decisions made vacuum. Social norms inform laws adopted laws inform social norms acceptable. people continue wear masks perpetuity spite overwhelmingly clear data vaccines work, mask mandates likely needlessly remain place.

This go without saying, anti-mask. wrote governor last summer encourage adoption mask mandate. I'm simply pro-data pro- reasonable scientific inferences data. data shows vaccines work, US truly ""rounding corner"", masks soon longer needed. point, legal social expectations wear mask need dropped. affected people would respect it. reasonable people hard time respecting others make shitty selfish decisions negatively impact entire population. I’m talking restrictions like many places Europe. Many places Europe locked significantly place US. corporate CEO states need ~~number one product~~ product going continue need similar products emerge.


Color shocked. couple weeks?? country live covid going “a weeks?”  bit late day Canadian government start new vaccination development programs.

However, great time begin develop annual semi annual booster vaccines - something government Canada could efficiently right now. 

Is Canada going ? 

Even U.S. seems dead water relative rapid development booster shot annual occurrence boosters.

Even dismaying problem dismissing use masks double masks vaccinated.

This exactly moment Canadian universities rev mask safety use washing research. Good know. Thanks :) cant catch spread it, seems like theatre point.

You *can* catch covid vaccinated although chances small.

And small studies show transmission reduced vaccinated, CDC cautious would expect.

I'm guessing though masking rules change soon vaccinated based comments Fauci. live Florida. Half people don’t wear masks wear properly anyway.

And cases still dropping rapidly, indicating whatever precautions taken Florida right adequate. mod, hate reposts.

As user, hate posting reposts. 

The LA Times post many AP news stories, usually Africa, buiness news. :( Best wings town too! experimental vaccine phase 3 atm, ETA September. buying, already ordered Pfizer AZ, come. US allies hogging stockpile Pfizer AZ, unlikely neutral countries ASEAN access enough Pfizer AZ anytime soon US allies finishes population first. Southeast Asia, even countries severe outbreaks last year like Indonesia Philippines, considered low-priority vaccine manufacturers except Chinese vaccine manufacturers.  paywall :( Influenza influencers decision respectable. read comment, hadn’t even noticed messaging missing year. you’re right! Top experts agree too: see Spain taken Ron DeSantis method pretend virus exist it'll go away worries all! happens :) Everyone loves put narrative nobody wears masks. It’s kinda dumb everyone wears everywhere go think there'll 4th wave make third wave last longer. agree, soon. Florida 4.2 away 33rd, since that's insignificant. Pretty impressive consider they're larger, populated, lot businesses risk since regions rely tourism. honestly think reasonable. really disagree all. Yep, best thing call around. Almost everywhere booked full, accept walk-ins. vial gives like 10 doses, good long they’re open, they’ll give whoever can. Pandemics textbook definition ""everyone's business""... whatever want - let people what's best them. MO. here. drove 2hrs north rural area get ours. times - wait 15min. loved easy access; grew - also disappointing seeing level stupidity among yokel populace... Thank You, appreciate it!! imply anything. said data similar that's fact. rebuttal meaningless number. overwhelming majority non-vaccinated people getting infected given week either. compare rate infection vaccinated unvaccinated individuals prove anything link that.

Interestingly enough countries may end last ever open appetite cases low. Places like Europe / UK / US probably pretty open even travel next months predict COVID going regional disease next winter.

I’m expecting vaccinated 2022 they’ve even said recently looking 2-5 years masks Covid precautions everyone gets vaccinated. 5 years. Ugh.  Dont, may boosters make trade I’d submit good old fashioned authoritarian control

""Those would give essential Liberty, purchase little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty Safety."".  
 

-Someone smarter Don’t it. badge holder protect it. Even don’t need boosters later on, lamination degrade it. good point even think that. Booster + Normal flu shot genius im honestly impressed still managing hit 2mil daily. Seems like lot places we're peak demand period focusing harder reach populations.  


That said, probably need look second vs first dose statistics. drop vaccines probably happens 2-3 weeks drops demand. may want start working accepting *no one knows* end game is. novel situation.

It's extremely unlikely masks social distancing become permanent. However, need see things evolve next months. said likely naturally immune, risky behaviour increases likelihood already COVID.

In way, someone going rain without coat umbrella likely get soaked someone take steps.

If disagree that, basically saying masks effective reducing spread, counter scientific evidence. Thank reply. question purely hypothetical, well understand practical limitations. wanted know worst comes fruition ie governments going totalitarian locking up. long locked for. bro, that's 1984 1994 paper cited 22 18 articles each. Ancient articles man low citation.

Here 2010 systematic review cited 70 articles say masks efficacy prevention influenza. 2009 study cited 140 articles saying masks efficacious reducing respiratory transmission properly adhered to. even cite plethora literature last 5 years pre-pandemic. don’t think event cancellation directly correlated anything guidance related lot cases necessarily

It's absolutely tied capacity restrictions. Lots states still outdoor capacity restrictions events set hundred people. event typically expects thousand people can't make money there's capacity restriction 1/10th that.  Sadly, capacity restrictions lifted speak almost certainly next weeks, late events, make decision several weeks ago. That’s hope friend Basically government jaded 1992 court lawsuit held accountable vaccine complications (there proof btw, courts failed hard). Japan biggest victim WWII! /s promise you, millions workers able work home even without vaccinated. companies care anymore. saying right, would new babies Israel. 

Jesus, conspiracies bullshit transparent. woods yet we... worry fall/winter. can’t speak others that’s pretty much case aus. There’s definitely feeling “it’s there’s need rush”. made little worse government bothering order one type vaccine deciding chance blood clots high enough shouldn’t used 50’s possible. majority us waiting become eligible wear retail establishments require want make poor employee come tell put on. minute chains stop requiring it, I'm done though.

I fully vaccinated though.   thinking EU, tbh, comparison. saying masks don’t work reduce spread doesn’t make true goes we’ve seen throughout world. “study” linked goes real life experience Canada there’s immediate plan lift mask mandates vaccine interest demand high. Much higher supply vaccines.

Again - months abide precautionary principle eliminate spread entirely safest route one run risk variants. shoulder muscle swelled bit warm / minor ache-y 2 days.

Yep work 9 hours saw lots people. saw zero indication decimation red squirrels 'scientists' insisted last must listen Zients 0 side effects either dose rarely get sick. brother gets sick time side effects. sure also important note growth decay rates. think vaccine decay rate important, want people shots lowers need build strategies minimize it, whether thats talking people, giving shots peoples family doctors, etc. I'm also happy emphasis covid case rate decay well like rate vaccines going something reported on.

However stuff worth celebrating. varies depending state in.

In Michigan, sign individual vaccine distributor (county health department, individual companies, etc), would send notification able vaccinate group. got notification individual one everyone's queue know one slot open you.

I got appointment available notices weeks already gotten shot it. CARES half mind believe they’re loving fact cancel visas keep borders locked right now... that’s tinfoil-hat territory.

Nah that's what's happening. Fuck Abe shitty Diet boomers Locally, started allowing everyone show without appointments. Before, mostly appointment handful appointment spots, everyone really wanted one pretty much able get one now, want shots arms. I'm saying postponing Olympics would person spectators throwing baby bathwater. FYI, it’s “wary” means suspicious “weary” means tired/lacking energy. point protecting Japanese people, Olympians staff. Yeah, looks like holding true! started allowing walk-up, appointment shots Florida week. Open everyone. First come first serve chaos, especially appointments. totally possible AZ mRNA vaccines fairly equivalent 1 dose,

I think UK stats 1 dose also little better AZ though. Rates hospitilisation least lower AZ.

I wonder location time could also impacted calculated efficacy. example time place variation evolved, even genetics local population complicating affect. many variables wonder efficacy numbers little different.


Edit: stats article actually lol, AZ show better protection mortality 1 dose It’s ending everyone gets vaccinated. many anti-vaxxers things open time soon. Oh, course, absolutely correct. facetious. 6 foot rule nonsense? know distance helps. Obviously magical barrier 6 feet there's balance practicality effectiveness. I'm person replying immunologist logic ACE2 would harder bind antibody flawed. Antibodies recognize small portion spike protein highly specific, binding region ACE2 receptor spike protein much larger area specificity antibody binds to. could lead compensation interactions outside mutated area allow spike sill bind ACE2. 

The part discussing polyclonal response, antibodies going generated portion spike protein actually binds ACE2. highly neutralizing antibodies appear receptor binding domain areas protein also targeted could mutated away without large effects ACE2 binding here. first shot line 10-deep checking vaccine appointments, second vaccine recipient store. It’s won’t least vaccinated could keep new cases manageable. It’s Deep South lot people wanting vaccine dumb reasons Yes, implied fraud know *precise* language agreed stipulations. such, deduce arguing bad faith adding qualifying statement.

The program terms clear. business owner's described actions way violate PPP forgiveness terms. would mention fraud thread imply it? think you’re good buddy, congrats graduation  definitely boosters variants mutate vast unvaccinated population.  100% confident asteroid hit house either, AIDS mutate airborne. 

Those three things theoretically possible unlikely. Well, even comparison?
Why comparing two shots Pfizer one shot AstraZeneca? Yes someone 25%, it’s combination quickly able accept life normal while, realizing pandemic life way hectic, natural introvert bothered lack social engagements. friends bothered mentally ones trying hardest get back things were, would even zoom calls friends seemed stupid pointless mean know 75% vs 95% efficacy plays real world backdrop partial fully vaccinated population mean course pandemic whole. think completely misreading I'm saying. said studies far shown reduced efficacy *all* vaccines various variants (especially B.1.351). Absolutely zero argument worries hell me. mental health impacted people commenting, ""Well, *my* mental health fine!""

I shitty home life that's getting worse 2020 supposed year got went shit. Seeing people shame others enjoying #StayatHome lifestyle help made feel like kind monster wanting much social bubble. cut hair even like Applebee's, much admit bad things going you, another anti-masker.  Yup that's card needs asked for. Illegal card holders prosecuted. legal card holders separated. understand sounds, emergency situation like now, implemented is! Although South Brazil lot German immigrants, eastern European countries too. Yes country don’t take pride largest bureaucracy government control, shoot opposite fact. Gosh must frightened power impression wrong. 100% talking Louisiana lol (me too)

I'd say second worst state experience, spent years Mississippi. assume third worst ever live Alabama Actually smug nerds talks requiring certain areas trying make sort inventive? what? spent $5M payroll throughout period exactly program intended do. fulfilled obligations terms, uneducated folks learned fungibility money.

Don't like that, helicopter drop billions money weeks notice. time implement means testing situation. anything AZ performed little better. mixing completely different phenomena. Japan physically received tens millions vaccines they're unable get people due massive bureaucracy. Nations like South Korea, Australia, New Zealand vaccines administer. entirely different problem they're facing.

Japan's problems unique. Mine's hit truck. hurts, mentally speaking. wonder I'll okay second dose see people again.  Check [timeline cases rose Pretty shocking visualization. workplace place enjoy spending time. I'm sure would convince people gym go get said could stop wearing gym provide proof. Check [timeline cases rose Pretty shocking visualization. need address problem though? fruitless? America -- politics defines everything, ""We together."" Trump even said took shot others should, matter. whatever reason, shot virus (and whatever comes next) ""we're gonna it"" thing. Check [timeline cases rose Pretty shocking visualization. Straight 6G Check [timeline cases rose Pretty shocking visualization. point 2, haven’t year prepare this? much time since second dose fair covid cases currently low makes interpreting 0 little tricky. question many deaths would expect see small timeframe low cases.

That's 97% number useful, may worse 100% reliable. It’s country succeed fail, it’s largely you. 

You may like that, that’s fine. people prefer system isn’t filled government hand holding babysitting. lot people basically went back normal level socializing last summer. Instead bars restaurants, people house. ate outside. would said due lesser impact COVID Far East. Low impact low incentive shot. 
But yeah 1% low even that. people out-of-state coming get vaccines made issue locals?

That's issue anymore went back it? 
Also requiring proof residence vaccine get really criticized disenfranchised illegal immigrants?

I know they've gone back open anyone Dade, least.  parallel effort getting people get vaccinated, probably stockpiling distributing N95 masks unable get vaccinated vulnerable. It’s really best option protection.

The rest anti-vaxxers rot hope COVID super mutant doesn’t materialize. Hope isn’t strategy think need sort backup plan can’t vaccinate.  knowledgable knowing talking able back certifications cringe. I'm saying know either way. One way could estimate see antibody counts start dipping time point. could show vaccine still effective point, suggest diminished response later on. again, antibody count tell whole story immunity, guess metrics provide strong indication need booster good mine. Around 850k new doses per day. odd definition “almost all”. I've getting flu shot like years. drop pharmacy go grocery store. Man thought American red tape bad. whole level. Holy shit  areas south probably see sort wave dog days summer. college belated person graduation year later. I've invited indoors graduation party friend. family vaccinated, family vaccinated, friends vaccinated (not 100% sure family members though). safe enough attend without masks right? feel like is, pretty much going anywhere year feels like big step. coworkers vaccinated, single/young, “bubble” (we hang outside work). It’s masks-off office months. Oh... oh god it’s Shin Godzilla God real dingus work school many vaccinated (I hope) teachers use enclosed work area work without masks. However, refuse this, even though I'm vaccinated, believe need set example students. situations, setting example important thing wearing mask. Students know they're vaccinated, see adults wearing masks. I’m laughing 
“we announcing announcing tomorrow state emergency day that” Hot take: core reason Olympics huge financial burden Japan won’t recoupe costs ticket souvenir stuff. 
Corona convenient reason. easily, least Pfeizer/BioNTech. can't view possible appointments already appointment booked. cancel hope manage snipe something better. Epecially Pfeizer/BioNTech vaccine appointments disappear fractions second, in, time load page move cursor select appointment, already gone. central phone helpline operator look options you, remotely browse even waiting time Pfeizer/BioNTech vaccine seems order 2-3 weeks. time, Astra-Zeneca vaccines consistently found available tomorrow. That's family tells me. top operation, even point locations able provide vaccines. easier drug store provider's office everyone call use individual sites create organized system utilizing government. long take US hit double digit deaths? guy better handwriting American high schoolers happy second shot Pfizer way! Already 2 1/2 weeks feel relieved engineer proteins living I'm happy argue sun goes down.

That's super cool! Maybe point deficiency understanding here?  
It seems counterintuitive mutation would cause **decrease** affinity certain epitopes (namely ones present convalescent vaccinated individuals) keeping **same** (or greater) affinity human ACE2. One would think ACE2 would ""harder"" bind (more complex) relatively simple proteins antibodies (not mention, say, antibodies rather polyclonal nature, need handful 'stick'). please correct I'm missing something important.

Of course real kicker (to me) specifically mutated virus **still** gain entry cell membrane (Furin cleavage). mechanism must remain intact mutation, non-viable virus.  


I suppose get scale amount infections taking place, especially place like India, seems mutation that's physically possible within scope 'viable' virus (there's lot disagreement general many possible mutations even RBD) eventually present itself. take , there's guarantee get mutations escape immunity, virus happens hang onto worst characteristics. (i.e. greatly reduced transmissibility causes mild illness). already? end March, China exported covid vaccines world, followed India, EU sorry, misread chart, UK, UK exported 0 doses March.  Thanks corporations. used work Luxembourg. reality ICU gets full, three countries within hour drive send patients fully vaccinated, would still wear mask? Legit curious, judgment. That's good idea. think make piece art fabric ones done them. Yeah, I'm curious  What's solution? Can't force people get vaccine. want risk getting COVID, that's something vaccinated people worry about. course ridiculous, do?  People aren’t friends family don’t relationship one thing never forget subreddit over, Pompous many Europeans Canadians much looked upon country time great crisis. can’t forget self flaggelating many Americans especially last year. saw coming... hope vaccines prove effective it, otherwise I'm afraid we're covid 2.0 Turns large governments lots bureocracy good getting things done, could've thought think things get really bad Far East. Perhaps COVID big problem people. 
No big problem anxious solution action shot.  can't really blame NZ towards back line 1) controlled cases spread well early importantly 2) simply funds compete likes U.S., U.K., etc. They're means ""poor"" country, small disadvantages comes something like global pandemic, unfortunately. Hopefully vaccine people 2 million day soon took technical writing class college. first rule know audience write them. requested signage also; reason start shit business wants it. 

Not pedantic, even there's mask mandate, business requires comply refuse leave, trespassing. Trespassing illegal, thus, mask required law (sort of). Yeah, know. assumed discussion Germany. glad hear booster shots needed. I'm one places simply walk many stores get vaccinated, fraction county surrounding counties it. think that's accurate? IIRC, dosis mRNA varies quite lot, Moderna uses different mRNA sequence. like use direct mRNA sequence S-protein. companies 'hacked' heck sequence order increase People say yes even they're vaccinated Even worse, I've people think we're diminishing immune systems exposing illness. I'm scientist never argue them, quite like worry getting vulnerable friends family sick. Well Luxembourg richest nation earth comes gdp per capita, shouldnt suprising also 60% Luxembourgers obese. (oh btw CO2 per capita also higher reason ever) 

But still unlikely ICU ever going full covid, even watch american numbers clear.

We really need bad luck then. difference Americans willing get vaccinated could got first dose got second. definitely happen. US followed dosage scehdule used trials. Ah. Okay. Well hopefully keep seeing lower numbers seriously? interval AZ Pfizer UK. Pfizer end Feb 2nd jab 16th. Headline editors pressured construct top line clicks. Media incentives suck make us worse find masks extremely uncomfortable, always take second can, lol. can't relate lazy take off. saw someone wearing mask, I'd assume felt like wearing it. might fall window, careful PC term actually chonker interesting, seems contradict old reports guess understand better Yes good point. saw post exactly said Jan. point ""regular"" covid dropping variants still come nowhere kick ass. Thank God vaccines! extremely simplistic say masks separated variety variables make explicit claims affect.

I'm arguing makes make positive contribution reducing spread airborne diseases, also magic on/off switch either. Oh ok See, making something said. said structure entire society around accumulation wealth, don’t surprised people prioritize money people. 

So, evidence Capitalism makes ""it"" worse? article OP posted great piece evidence. pay attention facts. books that’s “paranoia”, mine it’s adequately informed. SYCFROYFA vacuum matter. certainly could played role ability person access funds could play role severity/lack punishment receive it. 

But certainly initial question regarding matter. muh new normal US 3rd world country! one would ever want visit shithole!

I mean US like 3rd visited country world 2 Europe means easier people reach them. need article know ain't right. I’m favor keeping restrictions places lots kids get vaccine. don’t love idea circulating around.  street two houses everyone vaccinated. street first street 100% vaccinations zip +4 area. 
Side-note, zip + 4 two streets two houses each. street know least one person vaccinated. 
I make anything look great statistics tell would like prove. governor’s recall election late fall. political reality schools definitely open then, we’ll definitely new governor next year. source said that? wear asked. Obviously I’m I’m eating. Taking baby steps Congrats! This. masks become symbol 'look much care people'. he's talking future, already it. guess that's same...  know fauci talking relaxing indoor mask restrictions... Right?! listen ringing order cookies, hair elastics shave cream. Alright! assume someone mask alone car afraid catching covid? I’m driving two places need wear it, like work grocery, I’m leaving car. I’m scared catching covid car alone, I’m lazy take again. attitude literally know I'm protected think others might be, I'm stopping precautions, even recommended top health experts world I'm inconvenienced cloth face. I'm sure else call attitude, selfish. as? saw coming, Sinopharm seem effective reducing transmission two doses - new cases Bahrain surging despite similar vaccination levels US UK. matter?  Apparently Colombia fake news people vaccine tourism getting US visas revoked. Supposedly US embassy said true. Soon 

They EUA requests put several countries including US right lower age requirement getting vaccine 16 12 population lined up. Well that's viewing glass half full... recieved injection around 3:55 PM Friday, began feel effects around 2 3 morning next day. that's twelve hours later. feel well rest day shoulders legs aching, though began feel better dinner. also ran fever times, chills. Oddly enough, dry coughing well, since read dry coughing usual side effect, thought maybe contracted COVID-19 elsewhere. However, able sleep soundly night awoke feeling perfectly fine, without coughing either; theorize coughing may allergies. lingering symptoms day. exactly LA times article said. haven’t stopped get it. completely empathy point. I’m vaccinated people wearing masks doesn’t bother me. information necessary make informed decision around easily available long enough people understand it. don’t that’s point. studies data im looking Israel, UK, Mayo Clinic...and CDC itself. dies, won’t me. Good news: got second pfizer dose Saturday! 🥳

Bad news: feel like shit. Lol, yeah. People need stop paranoid. got vaccine, best talk roommate it, move life. fine. Wonder Woman Glad get god forbid someone needs disability funds cuz can’t work OH way getting that. Right, argument makes sense, fair amount people say need continue masking vaccines “only protect severe disease” “aren’t effective say” 

Also difference risk serious case covid vaccinated person US unvaccinated person New Zealand going minuscule, doubt “significantly safer.”  That’s unfortunate 7 days get second Pfizer, can't wait quit fucking mask. work. dude would sit limo refuse move, it'd take five us move him, *if could*. America good mask compliance compared everywhere else. best, it’s absolutly myth Americans alone wanting live world wear cover faces  Maybe Germany much older population Australia Given vaccines slightly effective, slightly fewer side effects, EU handle freezer requirements cash strapped need care value money, need AZ vaccine.
For parts world cost freezer capacity issues AZ vaccine remains good option.

The EU may need small supply citizens allergies Pfizer moderna vaccine. grandma died recently, dad NZ able come see final year, attend funeral, lives UK. heartbreaking, fact many people snidely implying anyone agitated presently-indefinitely border closures unreasonable really bothers me. 

Even beyond that, believe interconnected world travel exchange culture ideas core. containment strategy successful first place, would 100% board zero covid now. 

However, cat bag world even clocked it, country sufficiently vaccinated population think pushing continuation closed borders frankly sinister. Even green corridors extension ""covid free"" bubbles logically ends practically proposal quarantining third world want apply long term, can't get behind that. 

Vaccination, herd immunity, acceptance much lowered still existent risk death rates long term solution disease firmly endemic imo. don’t think pushing two games back simple. Atheletes dedicated lives this. Better specs everyone. basically sore arm. think backlash going swing way.

This highly depends are. Given user name suspect correct talking Alabama, I'm avoiding business places proved anti-mask early last year still refuse business them. see way -- pandemic clear instruction things like mask wearing, social distancing, etc. restaurants follow instructions, would trust follow rules comes preparing food? They're trustworthy.

As places *now*, little less opinion, although I'm fully vaccinated eating restaurant family kids also fully vaccinated. pains every time comes tv talks. feel like even performative, someone wants wear mask, cares? harm anyone else do.
 
Some people probably stop till restrictions dropped. may keep going that. may reasons wearing one (immune suppressed, allergies, cold/flu, etc). general populous stop wearing masks *eventually*. hand-wringing media seems pointless. gonna shitshow (fill blank) im holding hope

It's almozt like heaf line every Olympiad.  vaccine protect variants, 100% protection variant designed for. So...“how much risk unvaccinated person house?“ seemed perfectly reasonable question. case, answer seems be: risk, enough warrant pressuring individual further. Got it. idiot then, whose opinion matter. feel deluded? trying prove something? feel inadequate? lack attention child trying compensate?  closed fitting room infuriates you, can't imagine rage felt businesses refused follow guidelines last year.  hell not? never used humans, except hundreds thousands got trials. Oh, millions approved.  You’d go understand. least, “home” loose term, there’s probably river running it. Ask fellow citizens don’t get vaccinated, group project global pandemic. complexities here, you’re fighting one oldest things planet-and virus novel, too. think lot people, included, waiting wearing mask longer associated anti-mask asshole. It’s funny, female gym teacher turned smell locker rooms. Another good one era Hollywood Knights.  Japanese famously don’t anything without FDA approval Well hopefully get boatload vaccines next months pack stands vaccinated tourists. pay much attention words Fauci's, that's sure. I’m PI research lab stuff purely academic research implications human health even undergrads would know better this… question is, hell 25% people? guess must 25% continued whatever wanted whole time. dying every day

I'm anti-Trump gets trolling, right? Yeah, know 2 people got Covid twice. first time bragging nothing.  4-5 months later got little severe still definitely Covid. I’m thinking going find times weaker natural initial case weaker natural protection.  Yet vaccines (especially mRNA ones) people inoculated like someone robust case Covid. Done glasses fogging time, I’m sick blinder already am.  enough people get vaccinated variant spread quickly, could get situation lot people get sick hospitals getting strained, case yes shut overwhelm healthcare system. yes, it’s entirely possible shut enough people get vaccinated. read, Pfizer less effective UK &amp; Brazilian variants, notably less South Africa variant (though still reduce severity theoretically). Moderna effective South African Pfizer. enough data available Indian variant say much either way. So, ""protect"" probably poor choice words part. lived there? people LOVE telling others do. normal summer cost tens thousands lives price pretending everything normal. like US. lowest vaccination rate state US 25% highest 70% time traveler! comes past, future. wife Guillain Barre; reluctant first get vaccine showed articles coming CDC GBS/CIDP foundations, got post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

There vaccinated people forever wearing mask public. pandemic broke brains. Idk friend American expat would love get available. like vaccine clinics everywhere nobody turning up. Dam it’s wild many people take granted states.

My *entire* family fully vaccinated least week Pfizer Moderna, including 16 year old brother. They’re supposed approve 12-15 next week 14 year old nephew get Pfizer dose week becomes approved. It’s beyond easy literally anyone get vaccine choice here.

I really hope everyone Europe get vaccines asap, everyone deserves peace mind last year. One third country feels left society “smarty pants” crowd. take much reinforce feelings inferiority. folks found enjoy other’s company. stick together. attempt reach needs account this. seem far severe typical side effects. I’d contact primary health care provider get appointment.  Enjoy wearing mask forever then. never going fully go away. Better get used quit living fear. Otherwise what’s point vaccine? believe science? even close. CT vast income disparity. states never get 60%, Indiana hovering 35% walk-up shots available wal-mart people care enough get one, yet complain day long mask mandates.

I need move. haven’t advocated once. said “zero risk” new wave, that’s quite case yet. agree thankfully country following balanced approach will
Have music festivals back summer. Happy days! funny believe today Victory Day. Oh no, affect dozens, possibly even hundreds athletes...as opposed pandemic affected billions world-wide. I'm probably 25%, I've extremely cautious. guess like family quite bit. wife gotten spend lot quality time, I'd say relationship better place ever. struggled financially remote work. kids home time annoying times point caregivers back work even downside alleviated.

It'd nice parties say lack taxing mental health. also recognize there's lot privilege going is. Ok, every state either flat decreasing cases. national average plummeting. think solid evidence behind theory. vaccines making much harder virus spread restrictions ever did. don’t need fear Monger,my country basically back normal June lol. feels normal now. Good luck tho Team fortress 2 here, yeah know, joke.  Possibly. mention isolated world chance citizens get vaccinated sick Lmao said that. Cute straw man though. Doubt sad kunts go anywhere anyway Yeah, think right- that's keep hearing locally. think MUCH bigger liability make employees come unvaccinated coworkers. believe UK variant considered dominant like 2 months ago? Cases decreasing, point genuinely cynical panic pushing get clicks, hard consider anything else. totally understand frustrating. hope get many people board possible. sick this, definitely too. invested see “end” much possible everyone. outdoors sounds like another problem would solved higher bar becoming officer crapping US Vaccination efforts?

Maybe antivaxxers sure, overall efforts. think there's anyone knocking US vaccine status, especially recently. New York Times. Everything wrote factual. 

If you’re somewhere like Vermont, congratulations. hate I’m happy you. Wuss. would also say 25%. pandemic mental health getting worse, started going therapy working myself. look forward going eating restaurants, friends going events again. fortunately me, mental health wise best life. hand, need get better physical shape now, new focus. definition liberal, doesn’t mean political party perspective. “willing respect accept behavior opinions different one's own; open new ideas.” EEOC says employers require it. Unless NY specific law otherwise, mandate it. There’s whole lot supposition frankly, stupid.
a) 100% know vaccines don’t give total immunity. 74 cases per week Colorado proof positive that.
b) place 70% fully vaccinated? places America 40% range (The 70% initiating vaccines Connecticut still 40% fully vaccinated right one age 16 vaccinated): Another unvaccinated person gets COVID? That’s 1 300 risk backyard right second.
d) Gives me? fuck cares.

Oh right, friend organ transplant 50% chance vaccine took cares.

I know vaccines work, 100% magic, 100% believe someone listen risks. also could required athletes get vaccinated. feel like IOC able secure thousand doses athlètes coaches?  people frequently spitting mouth? Florida cases still plummeting. Gonna try harder fear monger: I'm expert japanese society article showed dozen people protesting, really intensifying situation? I've seen couple articles like one know media trying make situation nothing really general discomfort making event.

As side note, must really care vaccine lol, would riots country 24 millions doses freezers. amount fucks people olympics right quite low  Seriously. $5M could gotten Veyron, go value drive it. Someone committing $5M fraud exactly thinking investing money. become Bill Gates People hesitant need better explanations, told “Do I’m smart say so.” PSAs recently running Hulu area garbage (the newer ones past week improved slightly!) - one doctor saying vaccine “miracle!” get it, another nurse saying get vaccines totally eliminated smallpox (yes) polio ( almost... 100% accurate weak point attack ignore message) third health dept official getting shot looked like nurse wound harpooned - oh, needlephobes? accomplish? meant well, can’t see changing minds. 

Meanwhile, someone know said got vaccine wanted travel see live music again, waiting grow tail something. Instead laughing saying “duh, won’t happen” explained vaccine worked 2 minutes joking useful tail would been! didn’t actually think would grow tail, afraid vaccine altering DNA unknown effects new. simple, straightforward explanation - needed someone explain me, lucky know people know stuff took time explain instead say “I’m doctor, it!” Yeah I'm sure 8 hour flight close far. NY Vegas 5 hours... close. Feels close 400k infections day I'm worrier. think majority 25% either: Socially anxious/mildly agoraphobic introverts hated going anyway people working remotely comfortable home loving partner/family, worry isolation change income. welcome.  Wow, good. part it, original stress businesses, legal ramifications please wear mask sign front door. Companies rightfully worried stayed open adhere CDC guidelines someone could sue damages getting covid there. I’d imagine cdc federal government explicitly says vaccinated individuals live freely without masks, corporate offices make decision remove individual mask mandate. thing see cdc time soon, regardless hit 70%.  thats weird, would thought japan would gotten vaccinated quickly. live. day average heading beer bet haha totally contradicts saying, level requirement Japan still. example, kid allowed join daycare showed proof vaccination looked 7 day average? Yeah that’s good point, don’t know anyone got Covid. neither friends. state around 1500 cases 7 deaths total since beginning covid. We’ve lucky. 

I would love us get vaccinated “lock in” good work we’ve done last 18 months.   Pretty much Germany. 

At first, lack shots major cause delays. Now, bureaucracy patients regions appears biggest hindrance last weeks/months. system liberalised, people simply request vaccination directly GPs vax centers appears accelerate process lot. believe there’s meeting Wednesday. fatuous. plenty illnesses transmitted via exhaled vapor droplets, limiting exposure key way reduce transmission. Add onto fact restaurant staff notoriously overworked little-to-no sick time (i.e., likely work sick), makes sense encourage restaurant staff use face covering handling transporting uncovered food. Yeah guess that's valid point. 8 hour flight India Japan. Social distancing masks would required side. Totally, one held degrees cringe. love part country. outbreak now. Cases increasing. Call whatever want. good news. feel like US state Japan people would rioting streets. understand sit vaccines country needs one seems terribly upset it. lot make excuses go movie/club/bar/game/dinner/etc. ""We're pandemic."" convenient them. way, don’t problem people continuing keeping masks. don’t feel need continue use them. appreciate everyone’s concern, fine without mine indoor mask mandate lifts. bullied disciplined care pandemic count? Kind sort right guess one shitting US vaccination rate since February lol. many fellow Americans always play victim? comment causing incivility? stating covid shot two months ago protected fall/winter seasons? That's said worse. there's lot disagreement among experts right now. Lots places successfully 5 days week like year though frankly touch people. there's going fall resurgence. Woooot north east numba one! time high. What's source that?

What people hell-bent creating two-class society? Peace love - test bad news bad, good news good. downvote bad news call ""doom-er"" Outdoors bright sunny day park give shit. Outdoor transmission risk like 0.03%. total 17,623 PCR tests performed past 24 hours, according data released minnesota: 22 percent week week

michigan: 23 percent

Illinois: 18 percent

Indiana: 10

North dakota: 24

iowa: 15

kansas: 18

Missouri 28

What midwest referring Yeah affects also. go back US bit going get Johnson &amp; Johnson there. clue whether Norway even accept vaccination now, even though reason excluded efficacy. one shitting America vaccination efforts lol. Maybe lockdown efforts vaccination efforts extremely good.  Alabama 100% speak anecdotally experience Germany - many people age bracket (~30s) trying every legal (if morally tenuous) avenue get vaccinated. Mostly involving grandparent/ elderly parent/ pregnant sibilng sign designated care person, using private connections doctors often able share surplus supply. 

For personally I'm glad lifted age restriction Astrazeneca. need anything like that, fingers crossed get one soon. seen friends family year half! India way crowded US inter generational families live together crapped quarters. course spreading like wildfire there, matter time.

Everything mutants eventually virus come endemic. tend follow science (some posted here, believe not) burn out. going next batch hosts widely vaccinated. mutate, point, won’t hosts reproduce. virus virus things. 

I tend take detached clinical view virus future, detached emotional reactions…  think distinction feeling bad mental health affected. following guidelines meet individual people rarely result less happy 2019. symptom situation, symptom actual mental health issues.

To give analogy, compare certain lack happiness coughing symptom. cough, two causes: a) disaese b) choked glass water. pandemic like choking water me: causes symptom (being slightly less happy), reason believe acutally mental health issue.     paper Discussion cite another work T478K arose, limited vitro experiment, immunoevasion mechanism UK. easy get vaccine want one live. They're offering certain age groups, know multiple people decided wanted age group due asked got one. aren’t using them? scary Poland similar percentage vaccinated people Germany yet I'm twenties getting vaccine week. I'm worried may never reach herd immunity much vaccine hesitation. this? Oh, getting mixed news source? SCMP falun gong guys? mean guys handling mitigations well whole time rest world able contain it. American, got vaccine covid anywhere, would say probably quarter people know already gotten it. want get pass family. guys probably anxiety except brief times last year. shoes probably rushing get like here. right though, long Australia keep cases minor level? could end really bad. Wouldn’t Intentionally putting bunch unvaccinated people close proximity contribute spread virus rather limiting it? read article actually makes clear “This Trumps fault”, true fashion, isn’t full story. reality competent CDC could forced Trumps hand didn’t avoided confrontation taking bold stances. Adults (and soon 12+ kids) get shit together get vaccinated worry much whether 5-12 year olds vaccinated. Damn arm must sore af  Thank clarification. safe scandal? improved DeSantis’ political fortunes. biggest problem facing. Covid made us lazy... like you, ti find motivation. look like Gikkuk? Yeah exactly. Reddit full kids don’t know better. probably see “doctor” think “oh people save lives take lots school debt??” wonder they’d show sympathy law school business school debt. 

And don’t begrudge docs earning do. It’s highly valued skill lot people do. can’t imagine anyone feeling sorry financially. Cheeky, made grin, ty  germany priorized groups people got vaccines earlier government established vaccination centers. (old chronically ill people, people exposed jobs like healthcare workers teachers like, though different priority groups depending are) last weeks regular doctors got allowed provided vacines go them, still priority groups still apply vaccines. regions (eg.: NRW) astrazeneca vaccines available everyone somewhat unpopular. 

other ways getting vacine legal, currently planned ease lockdown restrictions vaccinated people example went rusia get sputnik vacine benefit currently approved germany thus can't legally taken consideration, pretty useless get vaccinated elsewhere/whithout proof. (besides caring health) idea argument? None? Seriously? hop skip jump across countries body water got Costco Japan. can't distribute vaccine like here? Actually yes eliminating distancing masking led Rt go every case. Messaging vaccines undermined mask mandate remaining months longer. [Here ya rate puts us 70% June 26th. (That's 16+, difference adults small enough negligible discussion)  That's current rate. 7 day buffer lot expect vaccinations continue drop. First doses currently flatlined bit, surprised see another big drop next weeks. Thank you!  Still Europe (Poland least) vaccines seem work strains far. shares similarites strains that's hopefull well. immunoevasion expected, question much. Guess see eh? Hopefully we're far away actual whole UK zero death day.

Although honestly I'm sure get many zero flu death days given year, even far spring. could start whole process another huge pandemic

She say could start again? Wow. totally misunderstood ""we could start whole process again."" US followed guidance vaccine manufacturer, decided never go it. US could also afford this, US never supply issues.

[For info UK it, read JCVI's document. It'll far accurate statement could ever best approach ignore hope come around time. attempt ""reach"" result vaccination becoming yet another culture war battle. store website needs cleared government?  Government use VAMS (built CDC believe?) many places.

It GOOD system, especially early default many states. CT used instance. Well, sure, 96% remaining audience :D. think turn super spreader event.

I blame Japan wanting Olympics canceled country.

Time tell guess. hesitant need better explanations

Facts also unconvincing people. humans think interact world around them. facts fairly dry statistics graphs, great convincing scientists, mathematicians, public health officials, terrible convincing general public thought anything mathematical beyond bank account balance 10+ years. get people dismissing 1% chance death virus freaking 0.0001% chance blood clot. 

You people believe Alex Jones says confidence vaccinated people develop brain plaques, ignore PhDs MDs saying impossible mRNA change DNA. tons science communicators trying reach general public loads infographics vaccines actually work, falls deaf ears. really know solution problem, far complicated 'better explanations'. you’re okay sacrificing Norwegians English name vaccine hesistancy, ok. not. case everyone person dies positive COVID-19 test counted COVID-19 death? Say, even died car accident?

So would untested people, otherwise symptoms death. can't many people, it? Im sorry simply work way. Aslong every single person WANTS vaccine get one - matter anyone else doesnt want vaccine matter.

If want vaccine, cool thats choice safe. u care get one? Everyone wants one get - whats problem.

And bring ""well kids cant get one"" please check SCIENCE covid 19 kids.  Fucking seriously?!? exact headline “pneumonia China”. Supply constraints above, US plenty vaccines UK not. jest, covid measles different. people covid experience long-term side effects reported lessened getting vaccine mean vaccines grant long lasting immunity, hence get yearly shots illnesses. 

Flu exception throws tens thousands variants issue screwing evolutionary process.

Coronaviruses hand much stable. survived original SARs still detectable immunity decade later instance. Probably quickly get moved morgue. kids home year go fall. area transparent case positivity across whole district schools haven’t problem. tons mitigation steps following. know  sounds like main trait variants share easier spread/transmit, could also ""deadlier."" ability bust vaccine really happened yet though, thankfully. Japan country stuck 1990. minister never used computer work before. understanding, Japan equivalent social security number. They've tried many years citizens sign one efforts failed. would imagine social security number would make difficult govt keep track got vaccinated. also imagine govt lacking regards basics. Masks already required planes. get vaccine you’ll nothing worry New England Journal Medicine publication BioNtechs BNT162b2 December 10, 2020

Participants: 43,548 multinational participants 16 older 

43,448 43,548 participants received injections 

-	8 participants injected BNT162b2, contacted covid least 7 days second dose 
-	162 participants placebo group injected saline, contracted covid

This trial allowed Pfizer Biontech ask FDA approval emergency distribution

It goes depth everything biomechanics BNT162b2 method action human body Pfizer’s part trials BioNtechs synthesis shared work data analysis PBS YouTube video mRNA vaccines flattening bit 1st doses. going confusing people go total doses since second dose shots plummet due catching first dip 1st doses Singapore community cases increasing good number people vaccinated Pfizer. Hey buddy blow Stupidtown? sure can't - remotely liberal sort selfish attitude. worst worst. Ignorant selfish. understand thing gambling either, clearly. taking terrible one, upside. chance Covid killing lot higher chance blood clot vaccine.  Overall shots might get small boost 12-15 approved week help 18+ % really unless parents get kids Yeah, saying adults shouldn’t selfishly want stop wearing masks protected kids not. adults act like adults little bit longer, children aren’t capable making choices protect take risk also protected vaccines everyone get back normal. big deal wearing mask little bit longer?  include positively impacted? true: - AZ used methodology Pfizer.  schools though ... Yes, there's good chance they'll update shot third align currently circulating variants future proofing purposes. enough doses get two everyone, reasoned would better two people chance immunity one risk claimed virologists time chance runaway mutation would higher, fortunately materialize. understanding things ramp week example yesterday total 3 first shots across entire country. weeks limited supply going hurt long run. Sorry, Astra Zeneca 4g, based older technology. want stats wearing masks likely develop COVID? Surely already aware that, hence masking up? reason think otherwise. cover vulnerable quickly. 

You 10 million vaccines, single jab 80% effective, double 90% effective (example numbers).

So either go long interval, cover 10 million people 80% protection.

Or short cover 5 million 90% protection.

We went long covered high risk groups (those made ~95% deaths) raising 2nd jab rates. people, precautions need taken people around them. science shows, example, groups (such transplant recipients) get adequate protection vaccine.

So notion commenter ""the least lose"" ridiculous.

I would implore everyone erase lived experienced marginalized underprivileged groups lumping potential strawman Japanese bureaucracy infamously slow inept. Could sworn heard death day... Really weird seeing sub say ""duh"" essentially months. get people sign waivers. Waivers solve everything. don’t open long world move without Australia. They’ll self contained bubble  reminder, Japan's death rate due COVID like 1/13th US. Yes, downswing wave still fair number deaths come out, Japan whole better best US states terms COVID response spread. major fuckup specifically vaccine front, know rapidly vaccination rate expand. Unexpected Boys parents UK second doses months apart whereas mine US three weeks apart, know US close together? Champion, southeast regional director International Brotherhood Police Officers, told Post sees vaccine personal matter. hate sound like don’t care, really don’t,” Champion said. “It’s personal decision. fight [the virus] every day. We’re among every disease world.” UK zero deaths dark souls run?! Good point hectic commute, get sleep hour later every day, get extra hour (not including extra hour sleep) every day. Where's negative again?  1.2m vaccinations per day, currently, fast enough vaccinate 84 million citizens.

Err.. that?

You understand certain demographics fully vaccinated, ICU admissions drop drastically? already happening various E.U. countries. top that, sun coming out, seasonality kick soon vitamine D-sensitive populations, Western Europe. well variety beneficial factors. Didn’t recently moved digital January? using fax recording Covid cases/vaccination then. Many countries ads drugs TV/social media time like US. kind effort needs cleared local government though... Personally life changed much. I'm stay home mom really talk friends family begin with. husband's job involves asphalt governor deemed construction essential beginning lost work covid. biggest change simply wear mask. I'd lying said mental health good tho, I'm sure blame covid it. I've suffered mental health issues whole life. Maybe pandemic made little worse definitely can't blame mental health problems said take away sunk costs. know actual numbers are, let's say buildings (stuff already done) cost 10 billion carry rest games would cost extra 2 billion. would mean 3 billion revenue, sure whole thing would still unprofitable, would make economic sense go Wait - digg still around? problem mutations still result enhanced binding ACE2 also evading immune system. two almost go hand hand physical interactions - interaction one protein changes, interaction proteins well change too, especially limited portion protein present (it's even full spike expressed vaccines). Antibodies polyclonal however fraction likely longer detect antigen, vaccines still maintain reasonable efficacy far. impression someone tests positive COVID-19, dies - counts COVID-19 ~~test~~ death every time. guess who's going fired. Yes exactly meant. 12 get starting week. Masks outdoors even unvaccinated kids overly cautious. BLM spread covid last summer, didn't, children going spread outdoors summer heat. complete gamble, knowledge decades vaccine usage pointed longer intervals effective, vaccines even 6month+ gaps doses. MHRA knew manufactures listing 4 weeks due test range rather performance vaccine.

And turned longer interval even added side improvement, raised efficacy AZ vaccine. UK seen equal effectiveness deaths AZ Pfizer. really hope 2-11 year olds get EUA September 6 months 2 years get EUA October November. kid's daycare one positive COVID-19 test three age groups closed week. 1st million among vulnerable? That's crazy good.  say trust science comes death rates everyone age 80.

Do trust science COVID actually spreads tools stop transmission? vaccines help stop transmission 80s get back normal lives. people vaccinated given community, less need rely intrusive migration like mask mandates. I'm personally little curious simply investing researching booster shot going mean push us even marginal impact people already vaccinated. recoup investment. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess means due diligence happen determining necessary. imagine, quite feat takes time organize.

Did year long covid lockdown plan ahead? Right. Anyone claiming Japan hesitancy problem really connected Japan spitballing. think described lol.  testing. choosing say Covid wasn’t primary cause death, listing something else first - heart attack, died hospital ventilator due Covid. make sure people got least level antibodies  Yep, pretty much every country is. negative Nancy second wave summer.... super bowl surge? Say you’ve got 95 year old multiple comorbidities covid. hard tell exactly pushed mortal coil. Fucking lunacy even still debated. 1.88M doses administered US versus 1.19M last Monday. Third day row increasing vaccination rate. good see drop-off slow little. far based empirical evidence I've said true. Astra Zenica vaccine testing South Africa stopped evidence showed ineffective variant. There's also numerous variants Covid-19 already, currently handful concern. We've seen Covid-19 significantly susceptible generic mutation. 

It also pretty quick determine short medium-term efficacy dealing contagious virus like Covid-19. know long-term efficacy definitively yet, model based various things like similar vaccines various studies looked long-term immunization. said, ideally eliminate virus mutation allows gain foothold another host. Profit different getting money back many children died coronavirus flu year 🤷‍♂️ look numbers see it. current number people getting vaccine dropping fairly big rate, average 600k day make goal already looks like average week two. “The variant” calling ""hygiene theater"" compromise?

Why two options: Restaurants closed/takeout (that would guidance based science) ""let people decide themselves?"" 

Why can't rules minimize risk much feasible setting?

Wearing mask walking around food/drink shows going reduce amount spread. much? know obviously depends exact circumstances, going reduce spread, take measures can? say ""just like flu,"" that's terrible comparison. Flu vaccine based either live, attenuated virus, flu thousands years differentiate. Antibodies flu generally developed globular head region influenza, displays extremely rapid antigen shift.

mRNA vaccines Covid spike protein entirely different. spike well-preserved, exhibit rapid antigen shift, mRNA vaccines far effective variants.

It may true able vaccinate enough people reach herd immunity, comparison flu. people talked waiting it. hope use opportunity learn statistics. guy replied right--1 case statistically significant means  sources say reason people vaccinated covid? articles I’m reading pointing blame government poor rollout instead. Good them. Hope right pray best. People cannot live like longer. ""literally"" another type flu. Flu = influenza. evidence evidence absence.

No, absence evidence looked actual place would expect strong *indication* absence. makes absolutely perfect sense. depend live actually. son grade you. went school 5 days week entire year. Masks required it. minimal cases year lifted mask requirements month ago 0 cases since mask lifting. We’re never going back pace again. understood science wouldn’t worried you’re uninformed anti maskers there. sure you’re understanding low 1% people still triggered flu Bros. sad many people's sides discussion refuse evolve update knowledge. 

Covid flu, endemic like it. also much contagious definitely going away anytime soon. trying get vaccines Europe?

In France least age-restricted (55+) unless medical professional, cancer patient, *severe* comorbidity.

I've wanting get asthma (though severe enough prioritized), meanwhile eligible parents refusing take they're scared 5G, take homeopathy instead. 

I'm hoping covid thing blows soon get back burning fucking country ground. japan vaccinated population common childhood diseases, seasonal flu etc? find hard believe know squat vaccination go it.   growing bad sides town, corner stores would put signs face covered, wouldn’t allowed in

it kind weird seeing people sudden shift wearing masks. sometimes think corner stores long took feel comfortable mask mandates started kicking says 1% fully vaccinated, wonder there’s higher percentage people received one dose. 

Tried google some, seems rollout handled great government. really people wanting it, government fucking America bad, upvote left okay, makes sense. think think whether country conservative progressive *personally* think culture first, things like social issues social services. 

like place like Saudi Arabia great government run healthcare transportation call progressive country, y'know? due antiscience unprofessional leadership mean we’ve together 5 years entirely correct decent person who's countries immediately identify Japan progressive States.

Reddit hyper-intensive focus identity politics outdated views race, gender, sexuality, etc. immediately classify entity ""very conservative"" even ""reactionary."" Completely ridiculous.  Great, wish rest world opportunities do. Yeah: I've stated vaccination effectiveness measured percentage where, spected population, portion becomes diseased. said immunity binary, either immune aren't, linked national study (10m population) found vaccine *effectively* prevents 67% would-be symptomatic cases, provided information effectiveness proving point. Lying what? call girlfriend/wife whatever want. Vaccines: 50% ""We riot!""

Forced Vaccines: 30% ""We riot""

In either case: 20% ""I can't wait next episode Teen Mom""

*America* try: ""Florida's New Cases Decline 25% Past Week Despite Fully Open Economy Leading Prevalence Variants"" Lol got caught lying big time That's goes. get tell people like do. heaven forbid anyone else tells act greater good community. Sir, dumpster fire. point live it

No, don't. get everyone vaccinated achieve herd immunity, gone. France may opening early 20k cases/day, hence unnecessarily killing/maiming citizens. Unlike idiots got vaccinated. lot athletes games they'll ever physical condition compete in, even moreso delayed. incredibly tough ask assume athletes protest/sit event they've working towards entire lives, might chance again. going keep 5g date without booster? &lt;complete sarcasm get downvoted oblivion made laugh they’ve 10,000 deaths *total* 15 months, opposed nearly 600,000 US, guess people Japan aren’t worried covid.

They count covid death covid cause, unlike US say stroke die happen covid counted covid death. Welcome real world. Sure - go Japan, immediately notice public works every corner eye. Low cost transportation universal health care ways life would labeled something like socialist takeover America. It’s wrong Japan conservative things like LGBTQ issues, they’re still ahead many SE Asian countries regard progressing every year. think it’s confusing young people read conservative country when, compared current political climate, overall much left spectrum. We’re basically married reality, is. workers vaccinated, required mask. many bigger threats babies Covid. Coin toss. 

“So far, 49.1% residents received least one dose, 19.2 million people.

Among group, 35.7% fully vaccinated, meaning either received shots two-dose regime Pfizer Moderna, single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.”

“Nationwide, 259,716,989 doses administered, 45.8% Americans receiving first dose.”

Updated May 9 9:29 p.m. I’ve heard chain pharmacies able appointments, like CVS even grocery stores. actually think friend Houston went Walgreens hers, I’d double check certain. LMAO.

I'll see due embarrassment thank much. countries like japan completely incorrect ""blame"" citizens, citizens elect government. dictatorship people free that's different story. countries like US, Japan, etc....the old saying goes, ""we get government deserve"" ^^^
case point TSA enforcing masks transit September, unless changes, see CDC changing lot then. completely serious response, surprised workers Japan want vaccinated excuse continue working home. Work culture insanely toxic people expected spend 16-18 hour days office. apple like orange, different.  Musashi?  Maybe I'll finally stop getting extended warranty calls. Exactly! company work could taken PPP loans. Probably ball park $500k-$750K. best year ever opted solely feel right. essential stayed open whole time. taken money would gone straight bottom line income. I'm sure lots companies used legally need it. know Pfizer really tiny clinical trial vaccine Japanese participants, sure rest. think continuing clinical trials Japan due Japanese regulator request (although vaccines approved use Japan) people absolutely love told do, blindly support authoritarian. authoritian told take pandemic seriously Lol Australia Europe studies equate vaccine hesitancy perks vaccinated? Like peoples likely hood get vaccinated know continue wearing masks It’s crazy quickly went scarcity abundance Washington. became eligible essential worker three days opened general public drive town three hours away live get first shot. Three weeks later time second shot, could get without even appointment dozen locations Seattle, including walk stand baseball stadium. understandable. least something else could done though. tough line walk.

On one side, reassure general population vaccine works well worth getting. ""Our vaccine works studied variants."" true, thank goodness. 

On side, likely appease investors say ""oh, ready right away boosters, might profitable, unlike vaccine we've chugging months."" They're also lagging behind one dose only, matter fully vaccinated. CSGO France, Germany? one 

Literally entire thread explaining case. think get good response people /r/japanresidents topic. 

Several vaccines require second shot, like Corona virus vaccine. vaccines Japanese babies get North America not, well. I’ve saying couple months. thought would April it’s definitely may. vaccine America hit tipping point. people won’t take people want admit. buddies healthy liberals won’t take reasoning don’t see point it’s worth gamble. point people going peoples choice free this. vaccines work it’s big deal. wanted get chance full vaccinated end month. don’t incur risk Eh, general Reddit get pretty nasty stuff like this. fine post correct info, jumping someone's throat simply said 'I believe' going anything make resentful. difficult say 'hey, fyi____' instead rude. Japanese friend deathly afraid contraceptive pills b/c blood clots. thing Japan randomly fear certain drugs/vaccines? Protesting person really JP thing. Idk. people circles strong opinion vaccines, care enough go way get it. I'm sure similar thinking that. would olympics?
Fuck coca cola point let's say olympics oh know moe that’s reason please let know country someone 65, doesn’t work medical field doesn’t underlying condition get vaccinated. Stop parroting bullshit. Yes, people probably won’t get vaccinated anyway that’s main reason. black white. Japan much serving community greater good compared America, individual, self. That's progressive idea America, progressive countries. thoughts ideas well seem conservative American standards. strange mix. They're never going get kids old enough get vaccine mature enough reliably space without adults actively enforcing it. kids want play close contact, indoors out. masking rules school summer camp literally hope keep kids safe interacting peers. this, 1/4 way? don’t expect Deep South winter outbreaks. disease loves spread indoors, it’s nice outside winter. (Most time) Deep South outbreaks summer, everybody indoors AC running full blast spreading Covid around. 

With enough vaccines available may even miss summer outbreak year. Fingers crossed! I'm sorry. argument really make sense. Japan starting conditions every OCDE members managed vaccinate 2% population lowest OCDE members least 20%, 50% UK.

So come countries able evacuate 35% (on average) citizens burning building Japan 2%? Surely there's ""vaccinating bunch people complicated"". I've never Japan South America I'd willing bet Japan much, much better public health infrastructure south American countries.  youngest people probably waiting July beyond easy literally anyone get vaccine choice here.

This double edged sword though. vaccination rates limited demand, whereas ours, least Ireland, limited supply. We're opening 50-59 week uptake high among previous cohorts. lot others. Still answer need pharma companies immunity legal ramifications 2024. knows? far anyone “know” going happen practical scenario Aus/NZ still closed borders 2025 rest world open business.

The comment replied catastrophising is, reality, small delay vaccine roll compared western nations. business impact delay measured fractions %.  think biggest reason get initial trials done variants like Pfizer got really unlucky picked Brazil South Africa trial locations.... 

My guess real world scenario Pfizer, Moderna AztraZeneca offer similar amount protection. would think, proper understanding implications, would reason get vaccinated, rather avoid it. simple proposition becoming infected SARS-CoV-2 *seemingly* fully recovering, quite consequence free compared choosing get vaccinated. 

A hypothesis like serve reminder long-term consequences getting COVID, almost certainly less understood potentially far impactful long-term consequences getting vaccinated. human psychology tells us active choice make getting vaccinated, fraught second guessing, whereas passive (or null) choice nothing, getting infected, less prone second guessed. 

Then again, would think, society, we'd far better navigating pandemic we've done far. guess thinking happens reality, never easy reconcile.  Can't wait watch Olympics summer. world needs something like look forward too. country well, safe be, Japan. crazy. believe Ontario ahead Indiana. makes sense least month behind administering vaccine. 4 month doses hoping 80% indeed get vaccinated. gig worker, *technically* eligible get Cali March felt guilty privileged taking away someone else's vaccine waited April decided damn it, I'm going anyway. like two days got it, governor opened everyone 16+. course, like two weeks got first dose, pharmacy local Ralphs (Kroger) Pfizer available. similarly, difficult find appointment availability it, everyone it. Even local Costco! seen multiple studies almost total absence standard flu cases lower cold incidence? Pretty clear works. question people prepared continue save flu cold cases. guess that's big fat no. Exactly. way tell right now. likely lasts while, conservative prepared possibility won't. Sadly biology can't run simulations speeding time see happens, we're kind stuck current speed time. Man cannot fucking wait Pfizer 12-15 approval. brother last one waiting vaccine sucks can't go korean barbecue together yet. What? 


Pretty sure come booster gets you, say, 8% increase immunity new variants, there's absolutely nothing stopping getting approved health organizations promoting it. 

&amp;#x200B;

By nature health organizations make recommendations based health outcomes would likely promote even 8% increase immunity positive outcomes. companies invest millions development they're likely also promote it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just remarking might see situation booster available essential getting vaccinated originally. partridge pear tree. bring kids would unvaccinated area 6 feet studies map, first jab probably high 80% effective.  reading wayyy deep words. background cognitive science. I'm unfamiliar. I'm saying people acting like zero chance escape variants ignorant. virologist worth salt worried *possibility* escape variants.  i've wondering, pay vaccine US? know apples apples, Pfizer 30 micrograms mRNA per dose Moderna 100 micrograms per dose.

So ended 180 micrograms one shot versus 200 micrograms two shots Moderna. I'd surprised turned big deal. BJP horrendous. Problem opposition namely INC incompetent hope Indian national electoral poltics.   Fucking boomers always time limiting websites like fuck cares form submitted online outside business hours, no, register class 9am 5pm, monday thursday Absolutely. Tell vaping antibody response? No. death certificate lists multiple possible causes death. LAST item list ""real cause"". Someone tests positive covid, asymptomatic Covid, dies gunshot wound head counted; Covid positivity noted report contributing (in way non contributing factors).

Source: girf worked assistant 10 years. Japan worst case ""too many cooks"" everything government business related.

The amount red tape processes unreal.

For example go get drivers license there, better start lining 5-6am get seen day. get told though 2pm waited day.

I lived 18 months genuinely great things country.... dealing anything formal government related nightmare takes WAY long - even understand language. Let's look US whole.

If round population 340 Million, assume estimate 1/3 US population infected correct, 112,200,000 people sort immunity.

We assume 1/3 vaccinated individuals caught COVID well. means 152,819,904 least one dose, 50,430,568 already accounted for.

This gives us 112.2 million plus 102.39 million people sort immunity.

This gives us 63% US population sort immunity. Well Fukushima gave us Shin Godzilla, sounds like we're going get another one long. Yeah, problem science specific way communicating precise, necessary, also confusing laymen.

""We evidence masks work coronavirus"", though certainly true beginning (Because, well, evidence basically anything time) taken mean ""masks work"".

The thing vaccine. point evidence point fact protection afforded vaccine lasts 8 months (or whenever first trial started). mean lasts 8 months, means started testing 8 months ago, impossible say certainly last longer. absolutely might need booster 12 months, 18 months, maybe immunity lasts 10 years. know, conservative approach right ""plan worst case scenario go there"".

The problem people running around saying ""it's impossible vaccinate way this, immunity lasts 8 months, able vaccinate everyone starting again!""

Though right science remain neutral ""we know long lasts"" sense, layman's perspective, good reason think immunity last good amount time, COVID-19 fairly stable mutations perspective, we're targeting protein required penetrate cells. yes, possible mutation allows escape, relatively unlikely point. every single person stayed inside two months, still wouldn’t work. Eventually would case via animal reservoir. They’ve campaigns now. remember high school putting signs CDC “cover cough” campaign bathrooms like 2008. 

I see it’s habit many folks, hard break it! see, thanks clarification! Okay please get shit go. Let tell nasty wearing gloves is. protects one person. ME!!! Gloves touch everything much unsanitary hands. you’re going eat wait staff shouldn’t wear masks don’t food breathed on. Gtfo. believe that, sucks well. It’s sad idea wearing wearing mask political. I’m happy keep community safe. wearing mask public year, outdoors vaccinated posing harm, discouraging feel judged think academics experts participate kind rhetoric stop paternalistic assholes understand they’ve school x amount years people don’t “have” listen you, someone disagreeing you, perhaps objectively wrong (not going give kind scientific validity anti-vax concerns), isn’t ethical offense character flaw face. 

Instead smugly pointing degrees telling someone shut fall line, perhaps attempt understand anxieties reasons hesitant take vaccine giving. Assuredly many never reached they’re genuinely ridiculous fact acting bad faith, many genuinely unsure anxious. stupid “I degree listen plebeian” mentality counter productive, point, cringe, it’s immature rather pathetic. understand jimmy kimmel comic actual scientists doctors segment are, mind, rather pathetic.  Lmao effort?? Denying covid exist late making Nationwide go travel campaign? mandated reporter said know child currently abused I'm required law drop tip off. know shit words reddit post. I'd report it, I've done I'll fuckin again. can’t speak everyone, depressed pandemic. Continuing miserable business usual. think that’s insane, look testing numbers. People still can’t get tests need/want them, year this. Japan’s government done pretty crap job overall Covid. wouldn’t say socially anxious. moved new state year half. neighbors moved talked to, hadn’t really built friend network outside work area. haven’t hung pandemic. reason case almost start pandemic constantly things around house. Painting, new lights, fixtures, outlets, switches, sink repairs, exterior repairs, new car purchase, gutter cleanings, etc. goes on. finished towards start pandemic neighbors talked (now mostly moved away), hadn’t met lot people. work load slowed pandemic move forward.

So hang wife, clean re-arrange/organize things. Watch movies, TV, play games. Sit outside, enjoy yard finally starting look nice past 2 years working it.

Other seeing family 2 years now, isn’t bad. also enjoy curbside pickup groceries. Saves like 30 60 minutes weekend. think anyone problem someone choosing continue wearing mask.

Tucker Carlson problem it. since Tucker Carlson problem it, there's several million lemmings also problem it. Highschools start normally believe. 

The next group get approved 12-16, covers high schoolers. pretty good supply vaccines now. highschooler wants vaccine able get August. 

So comes schools want handle students refuse get vaccine. thought majority want completely ignoring minority opinions something we’re trying stop. paper examines effect fall 2020 school reopenings Texas county-level COVID-19 cases fatalities. Previous evidence suggests schools reopened safely community spread low public health guidelines followed. However, Texas, reopenings often occurred alongside high community spread near capacity, making difficult meet social distancing recommendations. Using event-study models hand-collected instruction modality start dates school districts, find robust evidence reopening Texas schools gradually substantially accelerated community spread COVID-19.

I'm shell former self, feel isolated alone. like I've become.... worked patio server last summer hot humid one. comment made realize skin probably didn’t get used wearing masks day actually heat humidity causing break badly. Sure, still risk. I've yoinked birth control getting headaches left temporarily blind due pill means massively risk blood clots. I've seen plenty women Reddit saying thing.

The good thing is, non- hormonal options available people like posters friend educated choices worried clotting. I've gotten shots, believe force medical procedure someone want it. called freedom Society.. probably need post real title. kids teens? still wear masks June? I'm 13 want wearing June. course are, article specifically Japan. Yo Japan, give vaccines India going use them. sounds lot like Germany, seems work regardless got hold enough vaccines.

Edit: Actually, please comment Germanys abilities process large amounts people efficiently.  download patch you’re saying Japan, you’re downvoted wrong. friends living *desperate* get vaccinated cannot so. It’s can’t find patients, haven’t rolled vaccine sites all. small population makes per-capita calculations huge. ""Worse India"" pretty rich \~100 cases per day. Seasonal flu around 20% vaccination rate among adults, exactly high. Even among front-line medical professionals vaccination rate less 50%. cant Olympics pushed another year? work. work state university, follow state federal rules extremely carefully. want people start returning person work mid-may, masks still required now. wanna go sit cubicle wearing mask 8 hours. finally safe enough go work year basically ordered work home, safe enough wear mask. area live in? wonder something near try find. Maybe ok add Norwegian institute public health recommend keeping stock J&amp;J doses case Pfizer doesn’t deliver planned. Pfizer deliver plan, Norwegian government plans give J&amp;J doses EU. realize television thing now, right? Sort of. They've already ~~paid IOC~~ lobbied spot, built stadiums facilities, advertised event, etc. point even limited event would probably net money/economic impact costs actually running Olympics would be. Even higher still recently given birth. percentage ""low"" mean still worth wary of. OCs makes upwards 50 times likely develop blood clot. I'm going scoff anyone wants think twice it. refuse take become another vector transmission importantly, provide mutations occur. Though mutations cause issues use, still enough hosts ensure variants continue pop greatly resistant existing vaccines. Take instance South African variant; appears reduced effectiveness current vaccines moderately significantly.  Whats source infections unvaccinated people? 

Your ""low natural immunity"" argument makes little sense given many people hot vaccine.

Honestly right answer probably Chinese vaccines work. thing happened chile Seems reporting place. probably good company preparing need third shot prolong immunity help combat variants. also important note far, variant current vaccine can't handle indication protection vaccine wearing off. Ahhh, it’s slow roll out? cultural? Hey, set Go Fund passport plane ticket I’ll go! Gotcha, really sucks hard get one I'm getting emails every day telling appointments available everywhere. hope things go better soon.  idea COVID “about risky flu” false, looking past that, there’s key difference flu kids: choose vaccinate flu decrease risk serious illness, hospitalization, death. option yet COVID. government incompetent. Nothing new makes feel better 10-20 percent attack rate amongst people live together aren’t significant others believe. Combine 90-95 percent efficacy you’re looking 0.5-2 percent chance catching covid assumes 100 percent chance roommate catches covid case. Given vaccines depending live it’s probably far less liekly roommate ever catch covid dropping 0.5-2 percent chance another order magnitude possibly even more. odds spreading one even less likely. It’s definitely possible shitty roommate won’t get vaccinated try put threat context wouldn’t change behavior based especially vulnerable people life also vaccinated. need tell buddies assholes selfishly endangering others. Yes, specifically need that. great. would say Pfizer Moderna they're cool mRNA technology highly effective! got Moderna happy that. One closest friends got J&amp;J, happy one-shot, although maybe tiny bit less effective. Download print copy card fill whatever name like. card proof anything. Imagine good masking must keep death rate check considering old population yet 1% vax rate.

Their fear wrong, one wildfire variant population going look like Brazil India.

But sure strange government can't coax people get vaccinated, culture general amazingly disciplined, mean take garbage home street even clean stadiums themselves/others, imagine ever happening USA? people parking lot 10 feet dumpster empty trash car onto ground looking open dumpster. You’re wrong, majority people reading American working hours going think light probably know that. know mental health horrible right now. probably good idea enter nursing program pandemic lol like go back therapy start medication got bad. help *already* pretty severe anxiety disorder. mostly controlled started began break time. 

I think isolation would get way I'm usually thing anyway. exactly loner, really hang work hobbies. really appreciate social interaction took granted before. 

 thing constantly worried catching covid even careful it. Every time felt weather family felt sick like rolling dice me. 

Combine high stress year long boot camp nature nursing program, fucking nightmare me. Thank god I'm getting summer recover. Hopefully covid control too. want things finally go back normal already. Yes, correct.

If 98%+ 12+ year olds vaccinated, worry whether 5-11 year olds vaccinated. I've got 0-11 48M people US. That's 15% population. 15% ~95% efficacy small bits population vaccines ineffective (or less effective), we'd looking R0 5 virus continue spread large numbers. Even larger would necessary consider natural immunity levels 12. think COVID-19 high R0.

So, yeah, adults got shit together, worry whether could vaccinate 5-12 school year starts. Except far authors provided credible evidence, subjected claims peer review. Lol first thought well. lot hikikomori protesting rooms. Can't use Google? BioNTech knows you. Pfizer moderna unless want 1 shot done change egg laying pre mammals placental mammals came virus protein infecting Germline cell run 5 miles often. mask stop catch breath couple times especially mask gets sweaty.

I guessing breath better nose I. end mask gets sweaty sucks mouth every breath.

I would also guess 9 miles endurance type run much really high intensity.  people skeptical - Japan real vaccine disasters chilled public perception. people want lives back, plenty people want jab.  stuff getting canceled summer around Im starting get really pissed it. Especially outdoor stuff. 

Covid ending, time realize summer normal allow it. Thanks taking time share - I'm kinda bummed learn - issues Japan Sweden (I thought .govs acts together) revealed covid...and *legacy* birthrate issues... Japan especially...the population pyramid looks like respect discipline Japanese individuals... crazy much sad. many people deluded avoiding vaccine, really worrying herd immunity. Vaccine 95% successful exposure. general, vague summary:

We know correct dosage new vaccines: dose would generate maximum immunity minimum side effects. knew set dosage trial low fear side effects, we'd lose vaccine could worked. picked dosages high side that's know works, that's we're giving people. trials progress determine exactly ""right"" dosage is, almost certainly significantly lower current ones. long side effects severe scared significant numbers people, win (and looks like didn't).  1% basically amount people ask ""do want vaccine?"", kow talking say yes 50/50 chance. Yes flu spread year. 2018-2019 flu season, 477 kids 18 died flu US. far, 277 kids died Covid19 US. Polio animal reservoir though. ever said ""conservative"" defined American use word? Politics Europe, Asia, elsewhere also exist political spectrum.  Yeah, US hit 16.5 million shots administered even previous bungling leadership left office Jan 20th.

That's 5 shots per 100 people, five months later Japan half number?! (2.59% received least one shot according to: mind-blowing developed country.  People absolutely free wear masks even need to, makes feel safer. Nobody shame criticize that.

However, people **not** required wear masks situations data back up, e.g. outside unless crowded area.

Keeping unnecessary requirements real harm ability impose restrictions future, needed. order government able swiftly impose restrictions people agree them, people need know government equally swiftly remove restrictions science supports that. Well, sorta. Depends couch it. risk incidence 0.3-1% ten years usage, that's pretty low. fact, that's lower risk clotting pregnancy afterward. good understand risk consult physician, get pregnant risk would actually higher... Many probably are, individual performer probably generate money way could going back accounts. Thanks - expected downvoted Reddit something obvious it’s apparent many weirdos badly want anime fantasies line shitty politics. take shower mask on. I'm worried droplets would spread water 😂  lot people's cultural knowledge Japan (especially Reddit) comes anime. watched American reality TV Hollywood movies think US lot less conservative actually too. trust imported  medical personnel. Old people 75 starting next week areas  bigger issue many get day-to-day wages. don’t work won’t money food, certainly enough get multi-week lockdown.  Wtf authorities thinking honestly?  random...  medical personal. government fuckef bad pretty low risk, I'd speculate closer one two (spread out) doses, fully understand process.  govt Maybe finally available everywhere ""walk ins"" rather needing fight appointment? Purely speculation seems lazy among us really like jumping hoops make appointments hurt demand bit awhile. “it” referring already happened. “British” variant indeed likely transmissible. Jimmy Kimmel’s job educate public, trying entertain. NYC subway stations fecal matter air toilet bowl.  Except natural immunity COVID last long provided vaccine. Right said three listed three labeled variants concern. article breaks down. May mean maybe maybe not. wait see game unfortunately enough research. Also link thread showing data vaccines looking like work it. least circle, friends COVID past side effects first dose rather second dose . Additionally, seems evidence recovered COVID-19 long ago later vaccinated lower odds vaccine side effects recently recovered COVID. likely fine low grade fever fatigue day - nothing worry about.

I can't imagine whole recovered + single shot accepted places Germany offering ""vaccine passport"" based status. seems Germany going strict countries acceptable. amazing well-timed nicer weather. Vaccine uptake great, cases plummeting, people starting come things again. Optimism reigns.

The negative traffic also coming back. would ruin progress? Oh sorry, bad... know I'm talking about. /s

Okay, get Influenza-A shot next 'Flu Season let's see well protected Influenza-C.

I mean, 'Flu shot... 100% protect 'FLU, RIGHT?

(I'm saying get 'Flu shot.)  family boat. first couple weeks quarantine rough switched. became closer ever got spend lot quality time kids. 46%+ total US population 1st dose. means get second. even first dose provides significant immunity 2 weeks. mention many already immune previously covid. likely nearing 50 60+% already immune factor Yes - US enough second doses everyone plus enough doses give another 12% population second dose (which enough get adults 70% first doses).

For worth, appears part export controls doses beyond US orders lifted (e.g., Pfizer begun exports Mexico). point US need start exporting ""stockpile"". expect take place end May - point US enough cover 70% total population (kids + adults). Ok, that's fault getting vaccine. something employer needs liable held liable for. hope employers require employees get vaccinated, course. people need held accountable unvaccinated, anyone else. free adults get shot, fault would get sepsis COVID-19 vaccine? Lol many upvotes, course. maybe appearance wanst part result long journey self improvemebt work. extremely frustrating finally reach end goal results forcibly hidden couple months after. looking good one day wear mask. wear one **just as** finally got like see mirror many, many years. Gotta watch Sonic - lucky rings. understand government scenes Shin Godzilla better ever would have. idea thing preventing people getting vaccinated overly complicated bureaucratic processes Japanese official's inability act quickly, mind numbingly frustrating. Thanks! sure either. thought repeated article said gave reasonable conclusion made it. work real world. many people depend others. nurse works care home old people young children? someone heart attack? send ambulance? firemen staying home? they're not, who's taking care kids?

If figure keep people separate, long would wait? presume isolate people hospital people still get care, let's say group 100. 2 weeks per generation means could cycling group months. 

And final death blow fact animal reservoirs. could bounce back bats minks whatever. 

It's cute idea, nothing reality. faith adults getting shit together though.

Nor I, talking ideal world ""should."" developing scientific temper one core tasks governance city opened walk-ins anyone 16+ two weeks ago. winter Olympcs take place winter, would horrible year? Many years ago, yes. pretty crowded.

Probably could done 75% capacity though. Outdoor spread *really is* low.  Like said last paragraph, intense cardio workouts ideal, still near would consider ""impossible."" today england 0 deaths thanks AZ rollout also stopped AZ 40s. low cases yes fine countries control lead deaths due vaccine hesitancy see rich countries rejecting AZ J&amp;J brewery Erie away beer glasses voucher free beer people getting shot there. said they'd first shots day previous week. Though numbers super CDC said knew us suggested masks work healthy people.

 apparently didn't. There's big supply enough people lots places accept walk in.


Here NYC Javitz center (which usually hosts conventions, give idea size) serving mass vaccination site, went last week done 20 minutes. 15 min wait vaccine longer rest process. Place ghost town. gonna drop Kroger milk, eggs vaccine! really curious see cost-benefit next fall.

We sharo drop seasonal flu pneumonia use mask mantained keep numbers, cost using would drop compared savings less illness movie ""Shin Godzilla"" *brilliant* satire inefficiency Japanese government. Thank you. far many speculating thread pointing poorly written outdated information source.

My family Japan boat yours. hesitancy all, poor organization. 80 year old mother law Kobe gotten ton mail local government saying mail coming vaccines. happening weeks. couple days ago, mail said sign starting Wednesday, here's list 200 local places call book appointment.... Individually. protesters fault? governments want Olympics. 20 % go! obstruction well, left side, see anything. 

We'll look that, thanks!! Everybody world can't stay inside. Food needs produced distributed. Power plants need safely maintained. Health care needs provided somebody needs care children, infirm, institutionalized, domesticated animals. Emergencies need responded to.

In countries cases low economic system reasonably stable lock everybody except absolutely necessary workers get food supplies population quarantine everybody contact case, world ship sailed many infections population decent fraction undetected. Absolutely agree. anti-vaxxers often anti-maskers, too. us vaccinated still wear masks protect refuse protect themselves. becoming really absurd.

Yeah, it’s ok long handful people die! experiment relation future boosters needed less initial wave.  Depending severity asthma liste comorbitity vaccine. 
Talk doc, mine told medical History get asap. Got vaccinated vaccination center stadium Lyon last sunday. efficient organisation there. don’t think event cancellation directly correlated anything guidance related lot cases necessarily. lot financial simply bureaucratic.

Thats lot young people really subscribe BI? I'm sick trying get around paywall anymore. I'm priority group 3 job.

Look data mate, European vaccine hesitancy rates lot higher US. **The World Health Organziation said Monday B.1.617 variant first identified India classified variant global concern.
""We classify variant concern global level,"" Maria Van Kerkhove, technical lead COVID-19, told briefing. ""There available information suggest increased transmissibility.**

An incredibly worrying development. long vaccines reach every population Earth- never feel like sense control calm this. know anyone died cancer.

I guess cancer exist grand scheme things handful begin with. go viral vector vaccines then. still stand opinion lot people simply know free. think going hundreds dollars, boondoggle insurance. supposed funny think message misunderstood. kind failed funny side too, maybe that's people looking message droll comedy skit. can't find single reason downvoted. agree gave upvote. wrong people? keep seeing happen perfectly reasonable comments.  It’s prestigious countries obsess prestige. require people coming vaccinated, there's little risk remind us. us vaccinated fine. Ah yes, personally happen happen all. single covid case 2025 shut investment

What earth talking about. countries largely vaccinated 2022 well ahead majority world. worst window months western countries may able open travel infected countries Aus/NZ would wish to, maybe July-Dec 2021. nothing compared economic damage infection wrought rest world.

Very simply, something horizon stop Aus/NZ vaccination programs working, horizon everyone else too. depends location. Recently, NYC opened walk-up vaccinations public parks. areas may handle differently though. Sure bottlenecks known adequate supply. grabbing people streets tests employers making people get tests? seems odd many people getting tests knowing probably negative. famous announced Thursday Friday would announce State Emergency begin Saturday. 

This must Wizards Coast copied product announcements. Oh, glad checked them! Among Asian subgroup...

**Pfizer:**

1 sick among vaccinated vs. 9 sick among placebo, 90% sick among vaccinated vs. 3 sick among placebo, 100% point, subgroup analysis low sample size. leads wide confidence interval due large standard deviation.

I'll go whichever one allows quickest walk-ins. Thanks man! WAY worse supply issues Japan. Japan's obscene. NZ millions extra vaccines, would using them. believe Pfizer trial earlier fewer cases variants. Also, believe Pfizer tested participants symptomatic AZ tested participants may picked asymptomatic cases.  Right lot people opposed vaccine, need easier quicker get. Waiting line, driving long distance, etc... puts people off. like voting rules, make easier better turn out. great success far, continue so. they're FeAr MoNgErInG!! want precious bubble life invaded thoughts! /s information already posted Reposts removed. add on, also culture showing pharmacy would give spare, expiring shots waste them. USA basically took ""southwest airlines boarding method"" approach helped us ramp like madman telling Plague Inc. lied Japan? point #2, US letting people show hoc then? know UK we’ve got appointment system get text letting sign make appointment reach age group. seems working pretty well.

In cases yes, parts US walk-up COVID-19 vaccinations, far supply demand.

As far know, states, people 16 older vaccinated, we've already progressed priority tiers. Watch get downvoted nether realms let start saying literally surrounded medical professionals life, vaccinations boosters etc first Pfizer dose. I’m pro science pro vaccination. sane person is. 

I knew young girl extremely active gymnast dancer got hpv vaccine. completely fucked life. essentially done could sum up. shakes constantly, already tiny lost much weight, vomits constantly looks like deaths door times. vibrant healthy active young person got hpv vaccine horrifying witness. 

That said, fact happens, government vaccine makers know it, account it. It’s odds extremely low happening, still full support (obviously) vaccination programs. sucks you’re unlucky 1 million get appointment provider, I've seen grocery drug stores offering walk-ins National pride. Get flex bit. countries infrastructure established net positive even there's profit wouldn’t download car, would download 5G? already posted Reposts removed.  Years conservative rule. Offer vaccine Chili’s buy one get one free margarita night. vaccine 70% next Sunday wish, reality unless someone goes burns one production centers down. really wanna sure, sign election helper. Gets Prio 3 month. System inadequacy. Every single time appointment systems opened, they’ve quickly inundated often driven offline amounts DDoS attack people trying access websites make booking flooding call centers well. Nobody yet made system withstood initial onslaught.

I understand states continue issue—it's literally matter money, assuming engineers know they're doing. Either need pay engineers quality spend infrastructure, one way another solvable problem well-known best practices. Quick Question, Japan sitting 1%? vaccine's done year  Yeah really messed up. Almost international Olympics ticket holders countries much higher vax rates Japan, cancelled tickets. Seems like really stupid solution. Early like point, open pretty much anybody. Walk ins common now, even get shot grocery stores like regular flu shot. Cases plummeted 80% since January deaths low hundreds daily compared 4k week winter. currently winning. That’s r/cursedcomment best possible way  Say ends completely true- would apply Moderna well (because they're mRNA vaccines), could something else throws true? What's venn diagram look like people hesitant get vaccine people extremely careful past year, limiting interaction others wearing masks much possible? Disclaimer: I’m expert, I’ve able take away following articles: 

Combination - true lower approval/confidence rate vaccines Japan often attributed MMR vaccine 1990, IIRC ~30% vs 50%+ US. Japan also recently asked prefectural governments set vaccination locations, may even infrastructure available, giving shots storing shots. know government equipping locations freezers Pfizer shot, currently supplying two shots (higher temp compared Pfizer). I’m sure exact timeframe Japan currently also approved Pfizer vaccine, slated look Moderna AstraZeneca later month. Yes, here's hoping stays way, reassuring watching. read article linked? Right headline says ""many scientists expect virus causes COVID-19 become endemic""

Many = one debated 

Become = currently 

No article = ""just like flu"" 


Science question detail, nuance complicated debate stating facts certainty. type shit discussion among lay people subject frustratingly fucked. leave professionals, include word ""might"" everything think might happen.

It may may become endemic, know yet. one said anything human rights. Even almost costless real cost it’s applied entire population. 

It doesn’t matter personally feel wearing mask, it’s cost-benefit calculation. point cost outweigh benefits. No, also getting multiple visual migraines day, several days weeks proceeding period, led doc stop taking immediately.

Was vision blurry experience big shimmering obstruction vision? concerned, might worth exploring non-estrogen contraceptives choice. Estrogen root issue. How? got appointment, notice, nothing. Im 23y also neither wife 25y old. doctor told me. America amazing distribution. Look lot Western Europe. suppliers tighter kind worked like this. day appointment based. Near end day surplus extras people would spread word they'd walk up.

In Japan ""lowly"" nurse taking initiative posting social media day vaccine extras would big social faux pas hard relate anything West. missed mark there's big hint post why. relates second sentence.

Doing intense cardio workout much difficult mask strength training.

I squats fun mask 8 mph plus run treadmill virtually impossible mask. Ah, see. you’re saying eligible adults 5-12 year olds vaccinated kids would protected enough? makes sense. faith adults getting shit together though. need start paying people get vaccinated won’t get numbers you’re mentioning. wish would get numbers fine getting vaccine little nervous 6 9 year olds getting it.... Ok meant trust blindly, better? Yep person said. It’s close next olympics plus IOC greedy corrupt. Funny Germany 1./2./5./6. too, we're pretty good compared japan  love monumental decisions predicated people finding time zoom meeting. rate transmission essentially estimate first order derivative cases? NJ cases steadily going rate transmission going up. change rate transmission essentially second order derivative rate cases decreasing slowed down? interpreting math correctly. variant, known B.1.617, found preliminary studies spread easily original virus evidence may able evade vaccines.

Are fucking kidding actually say: “Covid cases declining 50 states *but health experts still caution loosening restrictions* 

Then proceed cite health expert completely contradicts everything hear Gottlieb Fauci even Uber-conservative CDC coworkers said they’d gotten splotches too. One went way hand. friend's cousin died last week, 20s, young healthy. no, not, yet. Japan a... large bureaucracy.

I learned watching recent Japanese Godzilla movie.

It really framed much paperwork bullshit go obvious things. often think Japan highly technlogical country across board that's really case. Many countries well ahead couple sectors still severly lagging others. mind blowing best comes masking worst vaccinations..
Maybe like masking don’t see need vaccination? morbid is, wonder something similiar would happened China virus discovered another month later. Covid discovered 1 month Chinese New Year realized severity fast enough lock Wuhan prevent lot travel. Wuhan major transportation hub basically everywhere else China Chinese new year one largest human migrations world since many people travel back family holidays. virus discovered later, would chance spread unchecked basically every city China.

At least, variant China experienced back infectious ones spreading India, actually terrifying bad things could there. thing, look google. 7-day average 667 per day now, 600 1000 last summer. Yeah hear you. "" [new allows travelers use qualifying at-home [nucleic acid amplification antigen issued Emergency Use Authorization Food Drug Administration.

In order qualify, test must telehealth service affiliated manufacturer supervised virtually telehealth provider, according CDC. telehealth provider must confirm person's identity, observe taking test, confirm result audio video connection."" [\-MSN international travel recent US-CDC announcement international travelers (including vaccinated US travelers returning US traveling abroad) able at-home test, Ellume at-home kit (currently available certain drugstores) able packed (i.e. liquids 3 oz) awareness/publicity type connection needs (cell data, wifi) connect live health-care practitioner determine easy use international? test listed $38, seams incredibly cheap, I'm unclear includes cost supervised health-cost practitioner watching exam hours service provided. 

I'm trying determine feasibility using test tour another country, I'm positive work website minimal details functionality. Maybe US literal, following trials exactly, UK logical, following history vaccine science? Personally I’d like hear idea they’re using prisoners handle nuclear waste lol shit tightly regulated Got first shot yesterday. Feels like weight shoulders, even headache today. Really? That's funny. country ATMs close couple hours max middle night week ""maintenance"" thats it. However, we're hot either comes banking transactions. Even though automated, transactions processed weekend madatory holidays. Probably people asked contribution. scanned mine front back pdf, took pictures front back phone. uploaded scan cloud storage account, laminated put home office file drawer.

I want carry physical one around unless place I’ve seen people crowded close together fireworks Disney. 

Other every group usually little space. We'll see. still view aggressive target. keep 650K+ first shot pace 18+ make it. We're barely (keep mind ~25K shots per day 18s). 

I'm skeptical case. Every incremental first shot harder last one relates hesitancy. 

I would 100% absolutely positively love proven wrong this. I'm guessing end shy - 67-68% adults July 4th best guess. Covidiots US complain foreigners again, ""oppressive"" government ruining summer, rather seeing another example virus' potential lethality left unchecked reason take seriously.

Humanity's propensity selfishness what's keeping us better future. Every civilization history, every country Earth, grown stronger stopped infighting. Imagine could accomplish peoples world stopped infighting? Honestly? Given bizarre things Japan hand sometimes (fax machines STILL ubiquitous there) surprised someone ATM transactions hand keep many ""office hours"" ATM.

This 100% guess doesn’t necessarily basis reality though. they're holding major event country. Olympics take place Japan corona would run Japan like wildfire. mean Olympics worth one death let alone hundreds thousands brought new wave Fair enough. doesn’t really make sense people refused follow guidelines would negatively affected later line. Obviously would stragglers got lucky time around idk could large number.  Yes is. Plus even lets say sake argument, exactly get new variants forming. We've 4.4m cases (that detected) without gigs on, clubs open etc. It'll carnage. Yeah I’ve stopped stressing national vaccination rates decided focus state, well. somewhere around 60% adults least one dose now. expect we’re going returning normal month two.

My friends family vaccinated, I’ll fully vaccinated three weeks, rest honestly doesn’t matter much. I’ll able get life real soon knowledge keep sane time being. fully vaccinated going month week. 1-2 weeks second dose remained extremely compliant fail wear mask exactly before.

From 2-4 weeks mentality got lax really quickly. 4 weeks even lax. I've started forgetting mask step outside car whereas never used entirety pandemic. also immediately take mask parking lot stores rather walking car strictly it, take walks maskless, giving lot social distance anyone pass. also hesitate check friends whether fully vaccinated, immediately dispense mask have. 

I'll probably keep indoors long required, extent required enforced anywhere, honestly...don't care anymore ""mask-faithful."" rest house fully vaccinated, well rest close friends households so...I really see reason be? don’t think already? That's basically we've doing. Lots outdoor stuff fire pit beers instead going bar. Chiming in.

Furthermore, orders come Friday afternoon. Many times, government unit (dept level tech support) pass chain command quickly techs (who treated ""not owned ass govt) clock out. cannot order anything so. would assume lot union? 

If case, can't change premiums mid contract. I’m interested much. studies estimating 900K+ that’s big screwed book. raise interesting point thought of... wonder people held due laziness see available 12-15 year olds rush take them, figure ""what heck, I'm already here!"" get jab. sorry loss. Glad made people former friends. Go meet new people shitty ones still sheltering. I've lot met many different people. everyone really awesome happy talking maskless people. Well imagine scenario would one like hajiman2020 said:

An outbreak Covid zero Covid country. Let’s say 5 cases imported Indonesia new strain like Jakarta strain something.   completely baffled sheer incompetence all. almost people knew vaccines way, government needs contract solid tech firm build system that's robust easy use million bucks. goes US, too, point we've given almost shots people want point moot, can't believe countries least looked US' slow initial rollout think ways improve upon it. add people said. indeed dubious wether it’s worth host Olympic. However politicians invested billions event, doesn’t happen won’t anything show all. there’s political incentive think happen. actually made significantly money 2020 ever before. Financially family well think fact felt fortunate situation compared others suffered gave us contentment. believe it’s written stone 


That’s true literally everything. That’s whole basis scientific method. agree. episode rollercoaster emotion. thought doctor convinced, all, ""Ah, never mind,"" letdown. absurdly terrible headline makes sound like woman's fault, rather nurse. woman kept forgetting she'd vaccinated went back every time. anybody wondering, use Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Hit best shot mean need booster six months? got kids lab chemistry kit ready go, waiting darn IP lifted! bit one you. recommendation, disregard distance completely? graph risk transmission vs distance it'd probably look like exponential drop-off long tail since risk never goes completely 0. draw like point, 6 feet we've drawn line. arbitrary mean useless.  surprising though. millions people like patients, hesitant apathetic, lacking resources get vaccines (separate pharmacy visit) possibly take time work side effects. OP talking jump number doses reported today compared last Monday. It’s early say pace increasing instead potentially anomaly today, today’s shot numbers OP’s talking Ok, perhaps missing something. I’m trying antagonistic could propose scenario either country closes borders 2025 world stays open? countries long since vaccinated, likely far better degree most. rich nations would able purchase boosters needed. absence pandemic isn’t legal right close borders (NZ certainly, sure Aus) government would draft new laws overturning BOR/constitutions. what? would politicians want it? would people let them? article

Indian coronavirus infections deaths held close record daily highs Monday, increasing calls government Prime Minister Narendra Modi lock world’s second-most populous country.

Ummm might time countries limited flight restrictions. big deal nothing changed kids adults vaccinated many not. adults got vaccinated kids would safe masks could go. It’s incredibly selfish willing take measures designed protect others get vaccinated want throw kids wolves. invented way prevent 95% adult deaths car accidents without needing cars functional brakes, wouldn’t stop brake inspections. Kids would need kept safe too. no, masks still required. I'm sure people less cautious, rest county. walking local brewery couple days back saw booth set give people first shot. heard also people one larger local parks recently. 

I got mine signing waitlist one local hospitals partnered large business area use one buildings. signed Thursday evening got text next day asking make appointment.

The process getting shot quick effortless. bunch people signs directing building show QR code confirmation appointment. extra ID anything else needed. Afterward gave sticker time could leave - 15 minutes later - someone would come help schedule second appointment already done phone.  seems like it’d easy tweak then. say they’re monthly premiums going go X% don’t get shot. Count 25% too. Maybe already family bit introvert. hardly go COVID anyway. Also lot people deal tough commute ability wfh think relieved lot stress. know people big fat wallet every card have, including social security card, carry everywhere. great idea. Closer 20x size Who's ""they""? think easier family. I'm honestly sure single people, without kids, without roommate, WFH unemployed, take precautions even semi-seriously it. sincerely expect CDC come blanket ""vaccinated people need wear mask"" policy recommendation next year. We'll get continuing relaxations policy, similar saw outdoor masking.  falling. Deaths lagging indicator. Pfizer recently applied full approval. article: Dr Wesley Miller, Chief Staff, comments: “Of 92 people admitted hospital since latest surge started, risk group people vaccinated all. made 88% admissions [81 people]. People one dose minority 11% [10 people]. One person [1%] two doses, within two weeks shot meaning full immunity achieved."" Yeah that's better way putting it.  They’re actually protesting cancel Olympics? you’re scared virus, don’t go. don’t ruin people want go. (Oh boy can’t wait start civil war replies.) OMG... Scientist PLEASE enter chat here? research think yourself? YouTubers know much health professionals comes medicine. Think people! Research! Right? Check increasing (or best nearly constant) &amp; 20% regularly really sick (hospitalized?) PCR positive? Talked South Korean/Japanese friends. say it’s definitely government. actually want vaccine distribution bit chaotic currently. Maybe US help CDC website indicates allow charge cost individual, try get money insurance company person insurance. Goddamn, love USA. Everyone know CA fully vaccinated, close it. mean get “what’s point still wear mask anyway” approach. guess never thought like that. don’t worry mom getting virus dying. don’t really care wearing mask. Plus bad teeth get hide fixed. could also mean escapes immunity (natural and/or vaxx one) EVEN STATE ORIGINAL STATEMENT DON'T?????????

(P.S. I'm laughing.) Hello fellow Mainer. I've definitely wondering cases havent really dropped much too. think demand started drying up. Half state pretty conservative rednecks state want nothing vaccine. work gauging interest vaccine drive seem offended nerve offer it. Lots anger prospect. They're convinced vaccine poison. certainly hope so, expect much. CDC conservative messaging. I've read countries isolated got rates near zero painted corner. get vaccine closed off? give vaccine means going expose population outside world process normalize potential infection. alternative continue nothing keep isolating. rule comes effect full FDA approval. Scientists really fucking suck interacting media, helped media blowing things proportion. look stuff indian variant, mutations seen vaccines work on. Yet media led ""DOUBLE MUTANT VARIANT, WE'RE GOING DIE"" *still* efficient reducing death, going mostly ability prevent light symptomatic infection remember well (i.e. take couple days immune system get rid virus). There's big difference ""positive cases schools"" children getting COVID school. vast majority children local schools test positive (Colorado) getting home, seem spreading school environment. It’s counted fully vaccinated, equivalent second dose purpose. NYer here. Super happy this. Let's get people vaccinated!

Also, FYI, requirement comes effect Pfizer gets full FDA approval. Hopefully done school year starts. AFAIK testing currently done paper yet.

From know variant, seems contagious B1.1.7 actual vaccines appear work well it. certitudes yet. would propose?

I'm qualified propose anything. unable provide good example fix preclude ability say ""this way,"" though. People tend forget hunting internet gotcha points.

That said, I'd start proposing stop posting sensationalist doomsday headlines literally every variant.

I'd also like remind everyone reading calling headlines sensationalist equal claiming they're worth discussing.  Things back normal going well me. I’m vaccinated. Coronavirus continue make things go poorly many others vaccine reluctance. won’t reach herd immunity years continue outbreaks, though smaller. It’s dumb. Yeah seems better soyjak.jpg frustrating. 

Do care SHARE information data allows make designation. incredibly frustrating organizations like tries wave imaginary wand world. science, share data, source collection method well conclusion PUBLISH peer review. That's likely. numbers keep going booster appear needed, unless people (immunosuppressed, 60+, etc.), want stop lying health professionals saying. nice day. Moderna working boosters then? Something clicking me.  Someone pointed still catch COVID wearing mask wearing mask right protection, wearing properly. know apply wear mine properly.

Implying wearing mask properly fully prevents COVID, effectively saying 100% effective.

So either troll, unable understand backwards logic. Semi-organized chaos like it, plus willingness make pinch. get vaccine many fast possible. Worry details later. Keep mind vaccines focus spike prefusion phase might help cover mutations focused specific version spike protein. Threshold herd immunity *Vc =* (1− 1/R0)/E, R0 basic reproduction number (for initial variant SARS CoV-2 urban populations, R0 \~ 3-3.5, cruise ships R0 high 13), E vaccine effectiveness (for mRNA vaccines, around 0.94. now, need 71% vaccination coverage herd immunity urban areas, 98% cruise ships.

In U.S., think we'll eventually see 71% urban areas, [mostly around eligible vaccinated. we're seeing lots rural areas US opposition vaccination become part religious/political identity, vaccination campaigns topping around 20-30% penetration date. States cutting way back vaccine orders, people, especially rural areas, showing up.

The variants concern like P.1 B.1.617.2 appear transmissible, likely evade existing antibodies vaccination prior infection, pose worse health outcomes younger cohorts. means R0\~4 E\~0.8 (with current vaccines), pushes threshold herd immunity 94%. think we'll hit threshold voluntary vaccination even among best-educated populations.

There boosters, especially mRNA vaccine manufacturers. They'll take similar timescales efficacy testing (4-5 months) existing ones, sorts delays ramping manufacturing creating distribution networks, still take 5+ months everyone wants get boosters. really help much identity politics limits vaccine uptake. like hugging friends workout today row 150 calories 150 dumbbell ground-to-overhead. sure physically possible wearing mask would utterly miserable would rather work outdoors something else entirely. seems like wishful thinking me… wasn’t long ago shared conservative risk graphic. Suicides might people trapped inside family members long periods time improved mental health. incorrectly assuming first come first serve fifty states. probably looks like Goku going super saiyen 5 whatever.  vaccine became available December/January, Japan opted hold run trials. alone put three months behind rest world.  aren’t acting like blue lives matter. NZ drafted new bill called COVID-19 public health response act. allowed temporary set powers would otherwise breech NZBOR. believe expires every 90 days unless extended. rules allowing extension include epidemic warning formally place ministry health. powers used proportionate testable court. Given 400 people die flu related issues every year none BOR restrictions apply normally, would seem unlikely closing borders cases amongst inoculated population would meet requirements proportionality IMO. Ahh okay reason read 2.68% first dose. should’ve known wasn’t true entire family gotten first shots. I’m little drunk bad It’s great won’t reach herd immunity though

Herd immunity disease nature reasonable goal. airborne respiratory disease. Fortunately treatment vaccinations evolve. Hopefully it'll prove less moving target common cold even influenza.  think mean bit. submission linking msn.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* state's one might good depending state us sane. _Some_. 39% people Canada first dose  Scary shit!! supply high demand falling don’t mind much, seems like win-win actually. Bring tourism $$$ get economy back track. Also, less chance variants. reply *is* good one still explain taking long. understand long list questions considerations government had/has consider.

But literally every world government.

Every government struggling access, fairness, logistics issues. government seems bad it. 

It's one thing able procure vaccines either competent front powerful enough get country something demand quickly.

But *have* vaccines, *have* population willing take them, still fuck royally? Japan seems fit category (perhaps India likely qualifies well, months ago) Same! weird. never even realized lymph node Canadian women artistic gymnasts already I’m sure they’re going best make place clean. It’s like it’s gonna random lemonade stand right front subway lol . really think made rule 8 least. whatever - another month go - hopefully - becomes thing past. think genuine probability get sick, definitely think would kind gross.

Anyway, every subway station city pharmacy (or two) corner. really get point getting vaccine street could walk next door get sterile environment. also say ""orinpiku"" Sounds like different philosophies then- it’s like either opinions affect actually shakes out.

But make trade I’d submit good old fashioned authoritarian control re: vaccine, rather see kids &amp; allergic people die get sick well Seattle hippies didn’t want sully body vaccine. Yes, I’ve heard people say that. Vaccine approved USA since December distributed since February. conditions granted immigration? Japan famous accepting immigrants account &lt;2% population. Mostly marriage refugee status. 
As 2019 get TFW visa that’s low skill workers far know. they'll india situation olympics happen workplace not, county not. Masks rule still workplace, customers wearing them. unfortunately conclude lot unvaccinated people decided run around without masks. Probably area high number active cases. Also study done artificial cells massively overexpressed LINE (retrotransposon) elements encode reverse transcriptase. case normal human cells unless things going horribly wrong, integration causes issues like insertion tumor suppressor genes. It’s likely results lab artifact little clinical significance.  Bro you’re blowing mind right now.  think booster worked time comes ready. Even it’s years away needed variants till now. Especially SA variant proven overrated major vaccine manufacturers. I'm sure one other. annoyed infuriated businesses refused guidelines last year. There's least one place return to, showed stupid management is. vaccinated, wore N95 masks really give shit anyone else part. 2 weeks dose two, care even less. Early needed make appointment, able get first one March 26 walk in. Since then, anywhere around problem walk ins. hmm 25ug pretty identical pfizer 30ug tho? smart country everyone wearing masks 1/10th cases USA.

But dumb government can't innovate new system getting critical vaccines people demand it. Yea, know since masters public health... never actually dived deep raw data see denominators.

You right, percentages tricky without knowing absolute numbers whether even clinically meaningful difference. オリンピック (""orinpikku"", transliteration) 五輪 (""gorin"", ""five rings"") used. Orinpikku older first used, gorin made 1936 reporter named Kawamoto way avoiding using English words imperalist era. Today, used fairly interchangeably, gorin sounds little get another wave population fully vaccinated. Also, even variants vaccinated people get minor flu-like symptoms, that's something worth closing country over. Ffs people made Covid part personality last year. listen you, can't used push agenda. gotten Covid, BETCHA it'd news. no, vaccine conspiracy theorist. Freaking hypocrites. care people's lives, use someone help cause. imagine that, virus infecting whole world. could call pandemic. lymph node swelling known temporary side effect problems solvable problems. still live world full buggy, broken inadequate soft- hardware.

There million reasons even decently funded projects might ignore best practices fuck ways. add pressure politicians decide stuff fast possible huge amount bureaucracy that's probably needed get anything going, really surprising projects kinds problems, especially systems, agencies, etc. place make processes reliable efficient. read somewhere closely related UK variant. Thus spreads faster.
We suffering lazy attitude one us took. month ago remember people slowly ditching masks teasing staying home. Restaurants movie theatres opened. Life full swing.
Every one knows Covids striking feature long asymptomatic incubation period. weird hearing given conformist Japanese society is. know rough % vaccination rate?

Is specific reasons, organizations like US (mercury, autism etc.) general distrust government matter? would new me. thought, genes Spain, Portugal Italy predominant South America. It’s dumb circlejerk. 

My state passed one-month mark open vaccinations adults. I’ve shots, took 5 minutes schedule shots, availability first appointment next day. 

46% population first shot (not 46% percent adults, ineligible children skewing number) 32% fully vaccinated. 

But yeah, America worse EU countries rolling vaccinations people 60s... Citation needed supposition. 

&amp;#x200B;

Weird happen past. makes sense remember experts advised indoors crowds people vaccinated something along lines, seems ok me. Outdoors seems there's need worry unless someone getting right face. even vaccinated assume likely safe. calls GF wife? You’re full shit lol Sure 100% vaccinated risks Covid lower common flu. something people stop regular travel over. ignorance harmful here. definitely supply issue, we're administering fast we're getting them. said, second shot appointments almost certainly going moved month two supply hugely increases next month. want risk situation appointments cancelled they're conservative second dose scheduling. got mine online reservation local University's football stadium. factory like. Yeah compared US UK Yep, soon announced goal knew would meet (relative) ease.

Spouting last line exactly kind unnuanced conversation people using excuse get vaccinated. get wanting someone able open ""Jimmy's needle hut"", anyone took year Anatomy college trained perform IM TD injections fine small amount time.

We let diabetics barely training time. (TD, admittedly). sounds like way organized yet organized enough. Pre-pandemic studies face-masks influenza show meaningful efficacy surgical medical masks though... even built CDC guidance surgical medical masks protect medical professionals influenza. Obviously respirators like N95's add PPE.

The fact CDC recommend Double-masking cloth masks real disappointment, truly common sense issue took 10 months come fruition.

I totally agree KN95 recommended all. Governments would need pony up. Take care need help. first responders would cleared traces. certain group people would aloowed go around essential functions like delivery. govt may manpower, volunteering could option even involve defense personnel.
People around world would need keep life hold survive whatever time recommended, provided reasonable timeframe. 
Yes, far fetched concept. rate world fighting covid moment. got vaccine first version covid. know country. mine, majority population gotten supply isnt there. know far behind finding vaccine current covid version whether covid going mutate even further. 
I know much viruses work. seen. Restriction ease numbers infected worse last year. 
I'm staying home people false sense security restrictions ease. Even people feel common sense stay home go random reason get infected.
Right idea seems cute. world looks china parts country locking people china little reported cases.
No, oblivious fact could facricated. times one accounted for. that's asked, hypothetical scenario many days take. staying inside answer? visual auras (which sounds bit like girlfriend experienced) normal feature migraines totally harmless due blood pressure etc. would advise push doc keeps happening, yeah discuss non-estrogen B/C doctor something try. Pfizer Moderna vaccines upwards ~95% efficacy.

The rest comment past first sentence simply hot air. I’m confused trying accomplish? 95% reduced risk insanely high.

Nothing 100%. reply irrelevant. Vaccinated people aren’t spreading COVID-19 statistically significant rates. Sorry. Aggressive? Yes, ignore billions government dollars subsidizing stock issuances. point merely ignores reality.   would best stating sources argument agressively rhetorical question.  ""Should"" I'm cool that. Required, legislated, nope I'm pretty sure Pfizer American German company either way made deals companies. EU thought going get lot Astra zeneca vaccine bank others much. Ah ok. thought daily count. Lots places US already reached “hesitancy” majority meaning people show whenever one showing all: Damn nice said, follow stuff quite closely good opinion Dr. Wen, several colleagues. opinion incorrect factually. decide gets it? 72 million doses, yea, great start, everyone needs two there’s 126million people here. 

Canada much worse issue numbers figured out. Looks like vaccine flow good though post leaps ton conclusions. “Granted vaccines appear work currently known variants”

Your comment doesn’t contribute sub/thread I’m sure replied first place. gave upvote. Two people already doenvoted standing this.

I agree original comment. Yes. Boosters needed considering wide spread. maybe year. jokes aside, think something like would great idea. Also reason declared efficacy 2nd doses AZ found 0 deaths far person completed doses 1st million got AZ. please continue unquestioning accepting advice authority.

I hate Trump right taking things face value. cancel permanently?? Please? HPV vaccine turned one friends anti vaxxer. 9 year old got years ago sick. top that, doctor would admit vaccine. She’s anti vaxxer anti masker. love Alabama 46% 1 dose, 34% 2. Yea, really get additional benefit that. Moderna first vaccine trial planet really want undershoot end lower needed dose, trial 25 micrograms, 100 micrograms, 250 micrograms. even said early wished included 50 microgram dose initial phase 1 trial, since test it, went data stuck 100. Yep, problem. really easy get lost percentages looking summary data. constant battle ask reviewing data, significant - mathematically, practically. one wants talk germany used innovative loose patent system. opened appointments everyone state (AZ), walk-ins far tell. again, grocery store kept announcing Moderna shots ass needed used walk over, really idea. people received organ transplants living individuals, example, engaging science denial, people ""the least lose""? quite popular idea. Reddit AMA, immunologist Chicago clarified case. fact good scientist would say said. i. e That's believe written stone. could possible new variant changes enough avoid existing cells infected again. need new vaccine booster happens. Fun fact, check articles mutations SARS MERS. interesting.
So conclusion, statement broad generalization fully accurate. Yea real smart people know enough listen Jimmy Kimmel... Romania thousands available places capital walk ins already accepted. Basically people EU countries started travel get vaccines...because past initial rush, demand lowering. Cant decide Olympic all? Lotta high pitched voices, punchable faces sensitive people bullshit running country way see best them?  weather gods Texas must missed memo lol end well correct one r/Japan  Japan want host it, means let someone else it. northeastern United States Boston DC enough operational stadiums facilities place host entire summer Olympics short notice. area also highest COVID vaccination rates earth. Exactly! financial report, medical one, disagree choice words ""no evidence.""

Reduced antibody activity absolutely form evidence, reduced effectiveness B.1.351 also form evidence. 

Now, maybe look evidence conclude update necessary. That's fine reasonable. that's ""no evidence."" Masks bit enigma, study-wise. Cloth masks appears impart 2% risk reduction catching COVID. Essentially: impossible catch unless running population level retrospective study. Early on, advice avoid COVID came advice avoiding flus same, reasonably ballpark, leaned heavily mask studies flu showed cloth masks seem impart impact (2% really easy miss!). KN95s available, probably recommend people vaccinated whatever reason wear public, realistically, endgame upon us vaccines, mask mandates phased next months matter what. Especially they're increasing world wide production lifting IP, reducing timeline poor countries seeing virus permutate society. Current timeline 2024.... something people accept here. Yeah, agree! That’s think everyone make sacrifice getting vaccinated. 

And let’s forget ‘can’t get vaccinated’ group currently includes children twelve, less likely die admittedly still develop severe life-changing complications covid. Also, Moderna contains 100 micrograms vaccine vs Pfizer 30 micrograms Yep. already caught Covid work heard vaccine might help long haul symptoms

Yep, took measles vaccine catching measles help long haul symptoms. Trump ratings gift them. Happy help! Congrats getting vaccinated! Called “Astroturfing” I'm sure. probably gonna hurt, might give baseline. would talk doctor it.   Funny forgot that. 0/1 also fraction know people say fraction something colloquially mean small fraction something small fraction would less 25% anything close 50% really seem like could categorized small fraction even colloquially. Yes happens. Especially early tests enough tests. choice goes first primary cause death always subjective. Trying reclassify postmortem common. small percentage end ICU smaller amount die. manage end ICU live, end hospital bills can't cover.  sorry simply work way. Aslong every single person WANTS vaccine get one - matter anyone else doesnt want vaccine matter.

The problem people want vaccine cannot get one. Understand, physican, everybody matters treated.

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I’m understanding legality this... like vaccine currently emergency use, full approval. Maybe he’s banking full approval fall? Apparently considering we're country this, yes evidence countries this, top medical advisor country saying undercounting. google chart, pulls [this NYT see #2 above. trying say US efficient rollout, Gov assign people tickets get vaccinated. opened first come first serve model (with guidelines restrictions) actually worked great. addition, chaotic, like got vaccinated Cal Fire tweeted popup vaccination site. OP made sound like type thing happen culturally Japan. common childhood diseases

No idea, remember nowadays vaccinations require vaccinating millions short order, children scheduled based age factors. Ideally, would want vaccinate 70%-90% population covid instant, obviously impossible, even antivaxx morons exist. standard vaccines, need vaccinate 1-2% population year can't actually early rapidly, children can't vaccinated diseases young age.

What saying like like asking ""How come there's trouble evacuating burning skyscraper? Millions people pass doors every year."" summer different temperature wise how?

Edit: southern states also lowest vaccination rate country... feel you, don’t intense cardio workouts. spend btwn 5 10 minutes treadmill hiit type runs warmup. guess would lot difficult long cardio session. also find people walking treadmill running much used well. wasn’t trying make non issue wanted say people generally able workout without complaining. hasn’t difficult workouts. even variants vaccinated people get minor flu-like symptoms

We know yet current variants. Also even fully vaccinated people still hospitilised cannot true 100% time importantly, know variants currently evolving impact could people made Covid part personality last year.

Being cautious covid making covid 
personalityy. Actual experts telling us cautious variants, international border control necessary time. guess know better them. exceptions, i.e. Belgium. might even overcounted.   passport  found really dumb heard people refusing get AZ shots ""vaccine shopped"" Pfizer, especially appears equally effective, maybe small edge given Pfizer two doses. Really, main disadvantage AZ imo relatively long interval period first second shots. Japan really, really planned better vaccination campaign actually wanted hold Olympics anytime soon.  spike protein can't mutate *that* much 

The thing is, might mutate *that* much lower vaccine efficacy.

Hopefully wont, far looks like hasnt. read would negligent least consider prepare possibility.  dare observe reality is? need make nice headlines, lalalalala. anyone know Pfizer tested shot whatever strain killing thousands India? That's particular concern since affecting broader relatively healthy middle-aged demographic, elderly. Seriously. fully expected Cruz everything undermine vaccination process. we’re nearly done vaccinating Texans using modern processes charging anything. It’s shock it’s hard believe America let alone Texas. year ago came American government bodies using COBOL, software development language died 80s. low expectations suddenly we’re experiencing 21st century systems medical structures. 

Hopefully starts wider movement modern software architecture governments (the outdated system couldn’t handle massive amounts unemployment claims, people reporting getting checks getting late) comprehensive fair medical system. Could imagine sheer cost vaccine pharmaceutical companies? I’d probably take mortgage pay it. confirm many people don’t know this. primary doctor didn’t know. thankfully I’m part research study blood cancer patients survivors got free antibody test spike proteins. produce antibodies I’d say 20% survivorship group not, maybe higher. Oh well? 

I don’t feel bad. Vaccine readily available now. Looking southern states, right: pretty serious wave August timeframe. serious winter (when holidays pretty obviously helped spread) still pretty substantial. It’s suggested masks stay around prevent colds flus. Given probably never going away, mask wearing end? Yet suicides down. People cope can’t discount go relief some. look NJ's numbers, likely even need get group. 50-60% vaccinated seems magic number full population protection. also lot natural immunity persist least another 2 years memory B cells. time expires (if does) virus background noise levels US. 
Meanwhile, China’s Sinopharm vaccine—79% efficacy, easy store—authorized WHO. Yeah, think simple. unvaxxed people getting sick spreading Covid19 office, go unnoticed. vaccine really effective others vaccinated. 

Now, going cowering fear anything, seems little ridiculous unvaccinated folks get go things nothing going rest us put trust science end pandemic.

They're using convention center mass vaccination site, even live music people wait. Gotta love living Las Vegas. got appointment first jab three days available 16+. fire department giving shots clubhouse 55+ community understanding, coordinating second shot everyone batch something like that. I'm healthy 35 year old, last line I'm already fully vaxxed. comments thread essentially said high level governmental bureaucracy. Basically complicated process administer vaccines Boom! Hospitalizations probably best ways. problem cases testing non existent last spring private businesses sponsoring vaccination drives. reading last night bar ""get shot chaser"" deal whoever came got vaccinated got free beer.

I know bunch sports teams setup vaccination events games. Asking questions learn. one downvote reasonable question. started vaccinating everyone 12+ today! dense unable follow basic reasoning.

\-COVID circulating lot vaccine rollout started

\-Wearing masks reduces spread provides protection you

\-Those wearing masks likely obey COVID rules

\-Those wearing masks less likely follow COVID rules

\-Those wearing masks higher chance contracting COVID

Ergo, anti maskers likely significant chunk millions COVID cases recorded past year.

&amp;#x200B;

I sorry appear intelligence marmot deduction skills cabbage. Wut rate remotely high enough.

Take Alabama. Right 34% population vaccinated. Meanwhile, 10,900 per 100k tested positive.

Let's assume:

* number people tested positive major undercount, we'll double number. Puts us 22%.
* folks who've sick still getting vaccine around rate everybody else.

So leaves little half population (51.48%) immunity. would surprised enough prevent another outbreak. varied *lot* state. example, New Mexico, centralized portal run DoH register vaccine. availability still limited, would send text and/or email (depending preferences), would log site choose time location appointment.  saying September almost kids eligible vaccine, hope sooner I'm amazed someplace worse bureaucracy ours. heart-warming. sure much US paid development BioNtech/Pfizer vaccine, know €375 million contributed BioNtech German government. 

That's really point, though, protectionism, whole world would higher levels stock right now. Maybe US UK specifically, wonder that's even point pandemic continues rage elsewhere, impacts trade, production, travel etc. anyone know they're requiring Olympic participants vaccinated? worse comes worst always host spectator-less Olympics, like NBA season. looking? World meter 22k Sunday fair number states reported albeit mostly bigger states [1/1 get says, anything that’s grown ground, fertilized knows what......I’d rather soap seasoning shit seasoning. That’s me. me. need regular social circles feel normal. feel weird. People right free germs. people like made totally clear throughout. you.

Getting vaccinated single person, every single vaccination builds herd immunity strongly decreases likelihood immunocompromised person harmed. No, 100% that's life immunocompromised.

Unless believe vaccines stop transmission mass scale--which proven scientifically--, fully vaccinated important thing person protect others. makes sense countries lowest covid rates get vaccines last. know that's reason countries behind, also bit unfair. 1000 vaccine administered India France save lives amount NZ right now.  think, like things U.S., sort worked accident remember gnashing teeth consternation U.S. whole poorly back January, ton chaos, one could get appointment, even mid-February, myturn buggy, etc. California weirdly outsourced vaccine appointment sign-up program company Maryland people like ""Wow, one time actual Silicon Valley erasure"" half sarcastic, seriousness.

Now May, even five whole months later, [46% gotten least one dose everything appears working pretty smoothly. things history, accidentally lucked working out. socializing adults? add answer already got, important thing ensure variant booster actually results novel antibodies/t-cell 'formation'.

There's small chance instead targeting new variant spike, immune system ramps old Spike's antibodies again. important test efficacy. Safety pretty much identical though, less concern here. Ignorance high India 🇮🇳 know sounds bad true. Add religiosity, overcrowding unhygienic nature many slums extreme poverty rural areas I'm surprised happen earlier. Numbers really comparable less testing back agree, still work Ok relate Japan? Christian nation I’m grasping else could possibly talking about. fuck talking about. I'm 25 getting vax 2 weeks , friends appointment soon , everyone write list certain vaccines etc. 
They fucked start bad we're getting along fast we're #9 world vaccination, far behind others (except Israel)  want make point could get herd immunity technical perspective. never will, could.

Sure technical standpoint possible we're smartest apes us still pretty stupid. incredibly difficult change another person's mind even best evidence available. already posted Reposts removed.  Quite amazing pretty much every piece data come UK shown AZ Pfizer par. What's explanation trials seemed fairly different? case we're time travellers. Whoah heavy. Yeah, looked one biggest bureaucratic failures modern times. honestly see issue here? around 11k athletes competing 2016 summer games, lets triple include support staff, judges, media, etc. That's still 33k people, lot, US administers MILLIONS vaccines every day now, surely spare 33k Olympics. 

(I tripled amount public games IIRC, means need significantly less staff manage event) fucking wish Trans men give birth, people give birth correct term Hypothetically speaking, many days everyone world stay inside eradicate corona, taking consideration time people already infected recover? doesnt staying inside work? ATMs ""close"" 8pm despite accessible street favourite one. Japan one countries way many westerners idolize want move to. country still largely straight denies anything wrong leading WW2. got vaccinated offered checking grocery store. 

I know norm. convenient really think people gonna overall snap back normal. think it'll take time things awkward might weirdness since people seen eachother person period political tensions intensified, people bit socially anxious locked dealing looming threat virus, feel like people living normalcy long muscle memory prepandemic living kick in.

It's like go back parents' house away find less slipping role familiar one occupied kid, think people naturally find back groove things bit. is, uncommon. think subsidies solar comparison. 

We follow almighty dollar. 

I see reddit post, saw day. cool brewery that. Better 100k get I'm :')

By time guys fully vaccinated 10%. I'm really surprised SK NZ especially. could essentially open tourism completely summer get vaccinations done then. also supply issues? Xenophobia hell thing shit Sherlock Japanese authoritarian, thing grumble SNS take someone vulnerable position. fact, olympian asked severely something responsible recently. Health games, sucks athletes cancel them. variants bring back Covid19 country resistant current vaccines. Neighbour here. like Netherlands better, bureaucrats everywhere. I’m planning visiting brother Tokyo next Spring, sure might safe book flights!!? ""lie"" particular upset about? sure who's voting since protein used implant uterine wall came retrovorus integrated DNA. Unfortunately, don’t think so. ruling government stupidly incompetent corrupt, opposition less incompetent stupidly corrupt. Fortunately unfortunately, Modi best India offer would depend risk getting covid. personally, probably not. risk getting covid extremely low. sit home office rarely see people days anyway, see similar position. Depends. walk in. even scheduling pretty trivial.

Check curious HPV comment too. Here's website found explains happened: take sunk cost already went building stadiums, planning etc. think would likely profitable  Reddit post might misrepresenting actually happening, agree incentivizing needed. find ridiculous all.  mean doctorate YouTubeology enough? nearly every problem Argentina. Except corrupt politicians stealing vaccines making parties homes. What's doctor smoking? Look vaccine shipments June July. ggonna get first shot July latest. can’t stand almost late night hosts anymore. Trump broke brains beyond repair. again, smug individuals anyhow help long haul symptoms? Japan like west. There’s way pharmacy could handle that. least 5 pharmacies within 5 minute walk house none hold 4-5 people time. They’re tiny little offices dispense Loxiprophen TCM mostly.

I’ve never seen public health nurse city/county/ward/etc health department anyone go medical things. 

I’m sure even exists here. Still lot restrictions beyond 17th May. 6 people indoor social situations, 30 people significant life events (weddings etc.) Fair point. yeah here, zero clue really. government gonna wake up.... actually gives hope.  Yes, issue pace organisation, vaccine supply. easily scale up, vaccien centers running full capacity. 94% efficacy means 94% reduction risk infected given exposure. something risky, like letting person raging covid infection cough face, 6% chance getting sick it, whereas would 100% vaccinated. Going gym nearly high-risk, vaccine negligible chance getting sick. Nursing home worker vaccination rate NY far far lower patients. one county 25% 70% think.

Ditto nurses, whose rate similar general population even though first line... smh. military logistics. military well funded used dealing huge distances great getting bunch vaccines plane wear ever needs go. shortages planes. Oktoberfest literally attendees. olympics year athletes. We're talking 14k athletes, along coaches such. Maybe even 50k people total. Include vaccine quarantine requirement see problem Yes. wasn’t actually wanting figures quoted 🤦‍♂️ true all. Ah well thats interesting. start working go like 1% 100% week something that'd awesome see lol.  Vaccinations some. Miniature American flags others. This! several people ask much cost got mine, like dude... free, completely free."
