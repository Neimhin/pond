0,2021-11-18,"  Haven’t first 2 yet. get 3 get soon booster you’ve already first 2 dropping resistance? says ""mental health conditions"". specific qualifying list. lost grandma January. also 83 vaccines available yet. absolutely hope grandma issues. Best wishes good health family. happens there's new virus town. Except time, excellent quick vaccines. here, got flu booster time. couch day, watched YouTube slept, fever broke 30 hours shots lol (fever started around 12 hours shots). Wife thing two weeks later like sick woke crying feeling like disassociating body, also cold got shots.

Needless say we're still happy getting done think we're going go double shots ever lol. understanding correctly: people won’t get vaccinated, keeps spreading mutating instead “flattened”. Therefore requiring us create take boosters seemingly indefinitely?  don’t work field, degree Microbiology, Immunology, Molecular Genetics. Keep fighting good fight.  work CVS covid call center branch. thought we’d different project now, looks like that’s gonna happening. That's problem capitalism, vaccines. truly worried wealth inequality owners/shareholders pharmaceuticals us, people? ""not getting vaccine"" fix problem. need remove tax loopholes. Tax money back rich. Take profiteering health. incorrectly diagnosing problem, results getting vaccine, unprotected, complicit allowing system continue. Would refuse cancer treatment money make too? shitload, cancer virus vaccinate for. mad Covid, never really bothered begin with. Come on, now. Oh know, I’m getting booster ASAP.

It’s fucking annoying, y’know? Like, everyone (*everyone*) said “two shots” got two shots “lol it’s three” may future.   Oooo I’ll try again. hope works time. None liked...  ok guy? chauvinism. arrogant. 

Government complex organization human society. people want use simple label ""democracy"" ""collective"" something describe it, despite truth running government full conflicts arguments

There may exist many interesting things may mindset understand trying put someone ease, particularly they're generally reasonable person, lot easier use data millions children solely use data 3,109 trial participants likely never experienced less common adverse events.

There's also bit data children previously infected SARS-CoV-2 limited; however, available data suggest increased reactogenicity safety concerns among previously infected children.

Which I'm overly concerned about, would nice better idea expect considering daughter covid months ago. spent 24 days Germany Austria August. Mask use almost non-existent patrons, besides grocery stores…. strangely enough. time masks required, enforced, Munich Salzburg airport Munich Hilton. see community spread occurring habits / lifestyle didn’t change since August. I've seen comments regional sub, suggesting people create doctored test results. whose employers require weekly testing, ""religious exemption"" crowd. sinister. can't comprehend people would intentionally interfere simple public health measures, like monitoring spread virus. know gets better. lot people jump conclusions right bat people bad reactions first shot scary even consider 2nd one. really talked 2nd one I'll tell folks old want see aplus want respoaa drain health care system. still brutal experience still issues ne resolved thegone away yet however Covid. T-Cells beg differ lifetime world emergency. sick day shouldn’t big deal. reason is, overemphasize need productive. Y’all need learn enjoy embrace sick day every while. Please listen anything  Please daughters sake listen this. literally every symptom listed second Pfizer shot (I'm sure left bunch too). took week, month started feeling totally normal. came experience thinking there's way I'd ever get booster. 

Fast forward, booster days ago nothing like previous. symptoms much less severe, worse 101 degree fever relatively mild migraine. rest pretty much like normal cold congestion/chills/aches. Point - past responses seem entirely indicative severe future response. Fingers crossed you.  may right, I'm hoping may still level mitigation on-going damage gotten soon enough smell/taste goes, least people get smell/taste back eventually.

I would hope let go 3-4 days stop tracks meds versus let virus go 2 weeks damage, former may help damage recovery. Interesting. 20% increase cases (looks like roughly ~70k ~83k total weekly) resulting ~10% increase hospitalizations weekly (looks like ~36k ~41k total weekly). Seems bode well. Though numbers seem differ think NYT ones google hard say guess right. NYT saying ~115k new cases weekly.  I’m shocked. People trying cling old world seems pretty natural, would shocked people weren’t trying Maybe learn write ""**all** people vaxxed **all** really sick covid.""  Yes. Pfizer 2x

Janssen booster likely course action never know happen road Covid crisis. Things keep changing. Definitely would prefer avoid Pfizer insane amounts money go developing mass producing vaccines.

They’re going waste billions/trillions dollars mass producing something people don’t know work.

And yes, even though understand 2 week side effect window, use belts suspenders use rest six months/however long making sure triple sure it’s super safe.

Which apparently even isn’t enough people like can’t even begin comprehend safeties factored processes keep us safe. could try proving wrong cant dismiss it. Please go ahead show data indicates covid positive cases number hospitalizations greater 1-2 percent point time since whole thing started. glad family lives far enough away traveling see holidays. 
 Pittsburgh area starting go cases again. But, nobody wearing mask, except people, see out. Everybody seems acting like over.  Bro read? need read comment went tangent based nothing said.    100% sure would willing bet life full SHIT saying non vaxxed people got really sick covid. even realize many non vaxxed people got covid mid 2020 vaccine even available??? even 10% covid positive people needed hospitalized would unreal chaos reality around 1-2% people needed hospitalized even vaccines around. interesting know 20+ people IRL got covid vaccines even produced 2 ended hospital 80+ years old.  extremely sick covid never lost smell taste. honest, scary wave /isn't/ variant wave. AY.4.2 widespread enough anywhere outside UK contribute wave meaningful way.

This flu season flu. regular COVID season. Hopefully average immunity higher next COVID season.  LOL. 

Okay. I’m done. You’re accusing chauvinism engaging yourself. thought maybe you’d something interesting say you’re clearly uninterested. Toodles.        CPC Communist Party China. correct official name

List bunch names mean inherited. statement shows totally understand ""history"" exist common Chinese people's mind

Chinese RESPECT history, history funny stories sleeping. extract lessons history feed every student. elite people across diff industry interested history dig experience history use knowledge form behaviors. Even people even know much history, behavior values similar ancient ancestors

One tip western people know. One dynasty write history previous one, summarize successes mistakes made it. regarded standard procedure claim current dynasty orthodoxy successor China. PRC started writing history ROC yet. ROC still alive Taiwan. PRC qualified claim orthodoxy wiping ROC

US construct buildings Roman orders, behavior values completely different. 

TIME time, special meanings. really familiar history, rise fall dynasties, struggling persisting people, understand nothing last forever front time.

While western people, especially white people always illustrations: regime best forever, civilization best forever, supreme forever would efficacy matter called safe 2 weeks in? distribute vaccine think works know safe continue testing? Worst case ineffective point? find difficult believe.  anyone get now? long pandemic pulling kind rhetoric. People go anymore. Find something new. Something something population density Gone completely almost 2 months. year half things smell different. Can’t smell farts that’s plus, guess. walk Walmart booster?  referring length trials, used determine efficacy, risk.

And reason ‘typically’ take longer likelihood catching diseases global pandemic super low; takes really long time enough cases register within trial applicants properly assess sample size extrapolate efficacy vaccine participants vs control.

In raging global pandemic, likelihood someone catching Covid within six month time period drastically higher likelihood someone catching, say, whooping cough even 4-5 year period, it’s MUCH easier quicker understand efficacy vaccine participants vs control.

I get that’s initially apparent, also look perplexed trials able shorter, science math makes sense. It’s actually bullshit media doesn’t harp fact more, presence pandemic insanely infectious disease actually makes trial period efficacy treatments/vaccines much much quicker measure. ever meet republican? Yah. 6-36 months apart. 

Primary immunization achieved 1 dose monovalent HA vaccine booster dose given 6 36 months later, depending product. Delta 1.5-3.3 times transmissible 2 times deadly, yet death rate 1.884 times lower original strain despite places much open year ago.

You accidentally made case vaccination. barely got restrictions left jobs Austria lower trashed. Croatia... Brother 99% people survived Covid vaccines even available. 99% people got covid never hospitalized even vaccines available. Covid brought world halt partly didint know much partly exaggeration.   I’m kind crazy antivaxer anything like that, I’m curious knowledge sake…

Are boosters thing original vaccine got? long it’s brand (Phizer/Moderna/etc)?

Or “booster” mean it’s something different? totally agree you. blaming anyone work food industry.    personal experience waiting 20 minutes CVS get shot. Then, one whole day feeling like shit. that, back feeling normal again. 

The day would feel actually got infected COVID-19. fever, full body aches, chills, headache, lost sense taste smell. Knowing gotten booster could've feeling like entire week makes relieved got shot. Oh.   rather get booster booster booster seem helpful stopping anything anyways.

what mean seem helpful? serious? ask got vaccine first place? yep. leaning away him, sign uncomfortable. Probably can't wait get hell away shmuck. Can't blame business/employees checking, we've see happens ask wrong nutjob thier vax cards. ain't worth 15$ hour see lots places saying offer Moderna, Pfizer, J&amp;J boosters, anyone actually going J&amp;J?  got booster shot last week. Soar arm, fatigue sleepiness 24 hours, that’s it. People making big deal taking vaccines launching moon without space suit. Duh. Temporary solution meaning new variants keep appearing vaccines may effective. It’s unrealistic expect billions people get vaccinated every 6 months. Vaccinations dont appear final answer although helping moment. number nasty sequelae result COVID infection including permanent organ damage, indefinite brain fog, indefinite parosmia (a phenomenon food smells tastes like sulfur literal garbage). likely case survival, risk could end unable work rest life. got JJ terrified. one shot one day someone watch kid able get second mo ths due finding someone watch kids.  man. symptoms yet. Got tested due close contact work. …paid taxes. storage constraints age 5-11 preparation. kept 10 weeks refrigerator. practices may nkt aware that.  Damn... need finally go get booster. got Moderna Vax January I'm overdue point check box saying underlying condition. don’t check, don’t fare. You’re taking vaccine someone desperately needs it. Everyone high risk chance get awhile     got Pfizer booster tired af day after. first shots Moderna. Gee that’s great. 6 months since initial vaxx. Tested positive Covid yesterday. reactions, mine lasted 5 days. can't imagine 1.5 weeks Can't repair brain damage nervecell death China disappear national tennis star, mess random corgi. No, data 3 weeks short. Efficacy infection. Waiting longer doses means longer time risk disease, one dose little efficacy delta.

Decreasing efficacy time seen UK too, 8-12 weeks dosing. Regardless, it’s likely 3rd dose number months later needed kids too, adults, regardless first two doses spaced. feeling gonna become flu shot type thing. shot year. Explain works  never going away.

Let's stop little meaningless headlines brutally honest, delicate results people getting stupider angrier. That's exactly Vax.  Yeah, people don’t seem understand science isn’t unchanging. New variants happen, learn new things virus, etc.. Seriously tho, plan nothing right? feel like missed something. Well, catch natural immunity coronaviruses lasts year so, likeliest estimate duration vaccine mediated immunity absence study results year, indefinitely.   really hated got hate unvaxxed still havent sick two years. Fuck vaxxers go hell  Idk. walked in, filled paperwork, got booster shot. questions. Bout leave Disney cruise Miami. Anyone 12+ vaccine required. PCR 3 days sailing date rapid test get boat.

DeSantis may gov, ain’t got shit Disney.    osha coordinator here. hit nail head. osha completely absent society last 18 months needed most, thought would give warm welcome back vaccine mandate. gtfoh  need regular immunizations… would thunk. common place immunization schedules time born time die. Canada approaching 80% fully vaxxed. Kids vaccinations coming still mask mandates vaccine passports place. Boosters happening now. I'm hoping avoid massive surges.    Risk minimization.    realist think possible given nations far asses inflating fucking head. Unfortunately, world science heard like whisper politicians fucking megaphone. second hand smoking?  flu shot changed every year reflect strain differences.

It reflect strain differences year year. changed annually based prediction strains prominent coming flu season. Sometimes bigger changes sometimes it’s smaller. also sometimes get right times don’t. “Reflect” gives impression adjusting current data case. time data current flu season late relying solely previous season could wrong. 

The point person making still stands true. immunity things degrades time. didn’t could immunize flu strains done it. doesn’t work way. Instead educated guess prominent vaccinate hoping help comes booster shot materials.

Many boosters are. don’t change Tdap, MMR, Men, etc. Covid changes enough vaccine change necessary doubt make change. might even see single vaccine address two strains way see 2,3,4 strain flu shots.

Overall comment change anything person said. get vaccines protect disease. point also need boosters. might different mixture different strain previously subjected could mixture. doesn’t really matter. Immunity depletes needs reminders time time. flu shot supports mixtures vaccines. would consult doctor getting booster. seem much stronger reaction shot people might best interest get booster. mRNA shot first 2? so, might want consider J&amp;J (which mRNA) get booster.  • German politicians telling experts (Volker Bouffier last summer, experts telling 8 weeks prior would happen: somebody told me, could known 8 weeks ago, - want keep busy this.    everyone.  No, you’re understanding this. example you’ve included, rate 25% hospitalized per infection 5/20 Covid infections hospitalized. extrapolate across population, I’d say 25 people expected hospitalized got Covid. **YOUR** data bolded says 100k Covid cases unvaccinated, 45 would hospitalized. 100k Covid cases vaccinated, 5 would hospitalized. There’s roughly 50/50 split vaccinated unvaccinated country (actually closer 60/40 conservative estimate). 2.75m Colorado residents vaccinated 2.75m unvaccinated. 

So…

45/100000 = .00045 rate hospitalization unvaccinated 
5/100000 = .00005 rate hospitalization vaccinated

2.75m * .00045 = 1,238
2.75m * .00005 = 138

1,376 expected hospitalizations extrapolated across entire population (.000025% blended). use sample sizes specifically extrapolate across larger populations. That’s literally math works. way math works tell 100k people Colorado Covid sample size accurate understates reason. can’t explain cleaner shouldn’t taken time others might want contextualize figures **you** posted ...I think understand definition ""significant."" Well, bless hearts, getting worse time. sad run across occasional professional person, like teacher, know gather info reputable sources.

And KF 95s nice. like cold too. feels better knit scarf face. wish made variety longer faces big nose takes lot mask, LOL. You’re fine. Thought I’d cruising booster cuz side effects first two. wrong, back running within two days! F whoever downvoted I'm coming year little taste/smell. rollercoaster emotions. I'm starting lose hope ever fully recover. I’m microbiologist think it’s possible stop it, take concerted international cooperation it. Everyone need care others get vaccine mask year. Getting people work together impossible part.

It’s basically country (Japan). We’ve &lt;200 daily cases nationwide month now. Tokyo (14 million people) hovers 10-20 cases per day. We’re around 80% total population vaccinated (kids aren’t approved yet) everyone still wears masks outside house.

Edit: add on, never true lockdown (just businesses closed 8pm instead 10pm-12am) everything open running usual! tourists. Lmao power mostly focused keeping power rich. focused well all. You, knowledge, freely go read exact studies government using come conclusion boosters needed. It’s like drug companies meeting dark rooms twirling mustaches. FDA advisory meetings public publish data ahead time.  Blessing disguise there, suppose. precisely vaccine good preventing severe disease. Vaccinated people lower counts virus body thus lower chance mutation. Unvaccinated severely sick people larger virus loads thus much higher chance one mutation.   make sure take de-vaxxing bath after? also reaction Pfizer booster. Didn’t reaction first two either. What’s likelihood toddler (1.5 year old) getting long term Covid? parosmia? toddler sick think it’s cold (we fully vaccinated except toddler goes daycare none us gotten cold yet) course anxiety telling it’s Covid. quarantining get tested (tomorrow), I’d like ease anxiety anyone statistics data regards long Covid toddlers. Good looking 👍     normal expected feel really sick receiving lot people. people getting side effects spike protein others don't. nessesarily mean working, working, bodies reaction introduction conversion cells produce SARS COVID-19 Spike Protein. people get worse go hospital get better, people recover short moderate time.  Also much less effective Delta originally developed  Wow. people surprised concept boosters? vaccines require boosters. Heck, newborns get three shots number vaccines within first six months lives. adults getting boosters vaccines, well. It’s uncommon. Flu shots annual, heck concept booster shots surprise?  Dude work got July August. smell nasty low tide day almost gagging. fucking smell that? Nope. Yeah starting get ridiculous... got kids boosters? How?  need weekends get caught housework like forced OT week.

It's going impossible, going way rougher wish. Los Angeles honestly many people wear mask indoors. City started vaccinate mandate check many business employees give crap check assuming even bother ask it. Basically covid stay unfortunately accept still viable sitting vial ~60 years?  else rules get made up? middle it.  did, everything oil tastes like shit No, 84.7% Netherlands. using bad data. Jan 13. love it. It’s good aggressive hopefully spur people would dither early vaccines action. basically means anyone sailing mid-Jan get kid started vaccines next two weeks. “Nice, country doesn’t respect human rights” oh, American Democratic party made discredit Trump specifically available pay fine actually lot fact check websites there, find many ""alternative news sources"" getting debunked, impossible discredit invent new ones every day. recommend using tools, delve deep antivaxx even more, stopped one point. Wikipedia articles fact checking, websites linked. Go also great check news websites trustworthiness. masks seem real small effect wearer source control, although final conclusions await full reports trials Bangladesh Guinea-Bissau. However, quality current evidence would graded—by GRADE criteria11—as low low, consists mainly observational studies poor methods (biases measurement outcomes, classification PHSM, missing data), high heterogeneity effect size. better research needed. Okay, correct figures adults 93% vs 74%. matters since barely children get seriously ill. guess it. Everyone follows advisories smh. [the funny, like literally triage happening hospitals Austria loads options. vaccinated people adhere it? I'd fucking pissed locked due antivax flout far safely possible honestly. teams? forward call? none all? Possibility get time? Since comment, read different article stated definitively CDC approval required. article also implied saying -- rubber-stamp formality. article (on maybe?) stated boosters could start available soon weekend. TIFWIW. Ahh cool, ruin lives. Much better jail. OP, I’m 41, got Pfizer primary series got 50mcg Moderna booster. kicked ass. Muscle aches joint pain like I’ve never vaccine. legs hips killing me. monster headache. arm sore, too, least worries. Clearly, survived, glad got done Thanksgiving.  thing losing smell taste still something happen get vaccine get infected virus. know. Thank information. 

In honesty used grapple question whether get vaccinated everyday. side effects rare there. admit fear irrational understanding anxiety simply doesn’t make less real me.

As right honestly say I’d prefer going jail getting vaccinated. hope people don’t think complete idiot so. never broke law, working full time job graduated excellent success school. isn’t issue science it’s psychological problem. 

Anyways thank empathy.  Sounds awful. I'm sorry happened you.

Makes angry remember times people blathered ""low mortality rates"" COVID, though that's metric impacts disease measured. would crazy. Vaccines necessary, forcing people still lockdown 60% vaccinated, clearly showing idea do. hate unvaxxed healthy leave anywhere. place Reddit anti-vax arguments raised addressed? joined “debate” sub, almost entirely anti-vax pro-vax subs know seem prohibit sharing anti-vax material. problem arguments obvious, others don’t answer wonder about. That's kinda point Christmas Market, attract tourists :D Horrific precedent. Austria ashamed themselves. put words someone something, put spell on:  still impacts them. Even breakthrough case long lasting health implications. need make mandatory school protect children.  false. Also israels booster campaign great compared ours. 

Is already cold israel? people stay inside time? NPIs like mask mandates, hygienic rules? good testing regime? plays that. got mine yesterday! I'm jealous. private school Boston even require vaccination teachers staff unless state requires school (which may, required flu vaccine last year) think see it. Im convinced it’s avoidable

It was. People listen we're shit. wish people would stop blaming anyone people listen. ultimately people transmit virus people responsible. 

The government knows well easy simply lock everything down, indecisiveness ignorance lead this, nothing else. Also unvaccinated austrian here. Die werdn sich noch anschaun. Die wollen knapp 2 Millionen Leute strafen. Das müssen wir erst mal zulassen.  vaccinated part population already bitter. move would furious (talking Austria Austrian).  Unless specified immunocompromised, got 50 mcg dose, 100 mcg. Good's question Europe likely thing France Germany Sweden along Denmark early 2021 AstraZeneca Pfizer Biontech second shot might give vtt blood clot Covid passes enforecable restaurants, shops, music concerts. done around world. rules place multiple countries vaccinated job lose job.

Lockdown come Austria winter here. winter cases fall spring/summer guess what? next winter cases rise again. Throw 1 2 mutated varients waning vaccine 4th 5th booster cycle comes back again. Absolutely sickening lockdown population post vaccines. hope literally nobody complies. Fuck this.  Sigh...not sure responding sarcasm. Great news! happy northern neighbors.  guess makes sense. dive bit numbers looks like 80% adults least partially vaccinated fully vaccinated probably around 70%.

When comes kids numbers much lower, kids 12 approved recently actual vaccine doses arriving yet (should Tuesday). sure. another article indicates sort formality CDC would likely “rubber stamp” sometime Friday afternoon. read article last night stating thought would happen went ahead booked appt weekend. do. always hate Dentist.    93 vs 65 virus care rights privileges. Many people lost right practice profession point pandemic (restaurant owners, event organizers, even barbers spring 2020). We've probably lost right congregate see fit point mess. us accepted knew best common good.

To fight pandemic like proportional, irrespective whether violates rights normally one would even consider violating like things mentioned (and course modern democracy carefully consider proportional not). point vaccine mandate proportional ensure everyone access healthcare need society function normally possible. Otherwise get situation like antivaxxers less given right keep rest society hostage. Things seem getting worse Europe, cold weather won’t make things better.

Anyone thinking things might get bad US again?  key factor getting booster shot couple weeks ago. want see vaccinated extended family first time like 2 years Thanksgiving Christmas.

I family chose get together holidays last year go figure, got COVID uncle hospitalized couple weeks.  acquintance mine, fully vaccinated doctor, got covid. time also fully vaccinated wife.

They immediately quarantined course. look bewilderment face told happened(now months later) crazy. statistical chance happen, fully vaccinated, extremely low really believe it. I. 

Some people unlucky guess... Tough luck. Nice! never going end.  Boosters approved 18 right now. Plenty 16 17 year olds vaxxed longer 6 months. question. husband vaccinated March. Eligible child vaccinated 12+ allowed.
Recently, nasty cold cough couple weeks. husband go get test, negative. rapid result, understand less effective. I’ve never rapid one, I’ve several PCR whatever that’s called.

Anyway, question. really wondering Covid false negative. antibody test best detecting prior infection wheh you’ve also previously vaccinated?

The CDC site said antibody tests may give positive due vaccination, effective detecting antibodies ACTUAL infection. stop short specifying test ask for.

Anyone know? I’m really curious it. kind hope did, came ok, would give peace mi c toddler young vaccinated. sick well.

I guess could antibody tested, poor thing like 4 Covid tests lots recent routine vaccinations she’s become quite needle-phobic.   Ok get covid instead 75% eligible population Austria vaccinated btw. far low also far 40% following Germany closely looking Iceland (was planning travel there)- biggest surge ever (on par Germany per 100,000) one highest vaccination rates world. They’ve (small) delta wave. Pretty sure it’s vaccine waning. know cases rise NYC not, emergency rooms beginning fill twice-vaccinated increasingly efficient Delta variants. everyone could get booster, did, might continue sufficient. I'm optimistic case time colder weather holiday gathering travel winter. I'm raging. I'm scheduled fly next week hoping see year since last year everything obviously shut. Unless missed something May 2022 already. That’s weird ass take. make sound like republicans brewed vaccines senate floor instead major pharmaceutical companies funded tax payer dollars, along countries funding. 

I’d argue we’d pretty much Covid US republicans didn’t make basic health safety concern something political divisive. Hell, republicans *still* can’t even get consistent messaging across board regarding wearing fucking mask, much less getting vaccine.

Sure, buddy. need believe Mitch McConnell standing bubbling cauldron marked “*Vaccine another flu, simultaneously elaborate liberal hoax*” you’ll take medicine, cool. pretend republicans weren’t trying get people sacrifice members family holidays (pre-inoculation) later trying get old people sacrifice “for economy” didn’t happen shows much truly understand situation.  Showing covid pass allowed restaurant/shop/nightclub/music concert enforceable done around world. 

Cases rising winter approaching vaccine wearing general population 6 months second vaccine dose. impression vaccinate everyone covid go away. 3rd booster last month. think im able catch spread covid dozens people? think wont 4th booster next year? Last year peaked late December. Hopefully 35% fully vaccinated semi-lockdown help somewhat, doubt it. 


New cases Krasnodar increased lot week. Aye, bodily integrity fine, comes diseases spread? limit is: give protect others. one would refuse comply, would mean *wanting* self harm harming others.  Really done WEEKS ago everyone would fully vaccinated Thanksgiving. good guess. know papers that. doctors go work studying bovine university. comparison people already 2 shots, comparison unvaccinated.  US wondering Germany lagging behind us Delta wave leading kind Delta+ wave vaccine waning. government ""forcing"" undergo lot procedures. happen agree consider big deal. 

I agree mandatory vaccination big step. Real BIG. necessary do? leave. endemic

It be, people would've acted smarter. County level really look immediate personal safety. 

In US we’re like 60% fully vaccinated, we’re 72% fully vaccinated. area (Long Island) 3 million people, 840,000 unvaccinated. number could still easily overwhelm local hospitals based geography. consent. Hence can't treat them. would like hear Burger Hospital Hardly, 70 vs 65 Austria.  We've changes since 1948 -- like, gained independence back 1955. Therefore, one could say legal system pre 1955 really Austrian might changed bit since then...

Don't get wrong, wish mandate go through. gotten hopes way many times last 2 years, many regulations regarding pandemic challenged front constitutional court. I'm slightly optimistic, prepare Much like Germany, Austria divided American, British, French, Soviet zones governed Allied Commission Austria.\[96\] forecast Moscow Declaration 1943, subtle difference seen treatment Austria Allies.\[93\] 
 Austrian government, consisting Social Democrats, Conservatives, 
 Communists (until 1947), residing Vienna,

Yes.

Ready adult stop ignorant troll  issue isn’t science continually changing. issue arrogance “we know all” attitude Fauci CDC. gave recommended info know incorrect, terrible job relaying info public.

Communication disastrous main issue. tossed around thrown occupants car. buckle up, ride me, you. Better getting virus dying year.   receive boosters year took vaccine? It’s misconception. made absolutely clear beginning. people forgot, others didn’t pay attention, used facts justify getting vaccines wasn’t permanent, others ignored first series everything done. known since summer efficacy drops rapidly older people around 6-9 months. likely assumed younger people without preexisting conditions.  Yes, US high gdp countries certainly going way go.. intention focus global burden. $700 realistic cost world really ICU alternatives. Largely get cheap meds die situation. stopped wearing face mask months ago I’m double vaxed. Haven’t sick.  right. Black Plague far less contagious. Brazil barely democracy anymore. It’s ruled unelected Supreme Court.    evidence Moderna might slightly better data compiled initial 2 dose regimen compared Pfizer. think lot people asking getting Moderna booster Pfizer. Even though Moderna booster half original dose 50mcg, still slightly higher dosage 30mcg offered Pfizer. right, protection Pfizer booster plenty sufficient offer impeccable protection infection first place...   Same- 3/9 teachers hall armpit node swelling booster (but first 2). Curious: armpit swellers female? Seems like trend   people simultaneously vaccinated people stop spreading virus going know infected.  Could report mayor's office. addition department health, osha, department labor? 

Honestly, call 311. They'll tell call. 

Dont afraid call multiple offices make sure heard.  Damnit, third got Starz instead Apple+. Guess gotta wait next year. [Data show reduces  Unpopular reddit opinion healthy overweight reduce risk hospitalization due covid 78%.

Overweight fat muscle. Underrated comment Mine getting tomorrow. side effects? *was* effective, people decided get vaccinated virus mutated.

 Also still understand antivaxxers constantly blame Fauci anything vaccine telling people get it. like need find villain pin blame cannot accept reality. expert either, everything I've heard indicates spacing several mo fine likely superior spacing one month. 

You definitely get second dose. third worry 6 months now. See recommendation then. Deep clean means spraying chemicals over, actually cleaning.

I want know spraying, people office say smell next morning.  bunch higher-ups wanting micromanage they’ve lost ability pandemic workplaces working home. train mma gym required vaccinated train know 40 people atleast 10-12 fake vaccination papers, that's people I'm tight told me.

The fake vaccine certificate place.

&amp;#x200B;

One interesting thing started back normal point everybody sick flu like symptoms, ofc fake vaccine go test covid know sure suspect good chunk covid suddenly vanished nobody anymore.

Considering wrestle shit might developped antibodies something ? available age group like week? kids getting tomorrow. Hopefully hit 50% age group end year. Seems like reasonable goal. nice username 0.43 equate 43 percent covid recovered? 

That's extremely high. know read data, maybe means something else. 

It yet peer reviewed, interesting true. I'd also interested define long covid. One thing heard suggested 200 symptoms could considered long covid. also seems extremely high makes easier long covid catch-all term many things.  Huh. Still works though right?  agree. ADN community college near SoCal doesn’t require molecular evolutionary biology (intro bio bio/science majors take) took biology chemistry high school don’t need take anything anatomy/physiology/microbiology + labs. classes required aren’t cellular/molecular bio heavy. That’s enough foundation. 

However, know, least UC BSN programs I’m sure others, even biochemistry required, extensive, it’s better nothing think depends training institution. really standardization regarding biological/scientific background required, tho. getting booster shot protect you. I'm sure even question...

Also plenty supply, people refusing get vaccinated.  feel? got booster last Friday. Tuesday boy turned sick. I’ve around him, nose little dry times almost headache. really feel fine. wonder idiot friend got covid early claims bad. can't smell bullshit. I’m sorry. Hope u r ok illness mild. everyone would get vaccinated stop pretending Chiropractors supplement salesmen know better epidemiologists even happening. vaccine [prevent transmission stop spreading misinformation. data showing *anything* reduce transmission, post here. scheduled appointment gave me. Didn’t ask proof anything except insurance vax card. Mostly privacy concerns, contractor try keep log vaccinated workers different facilities may require it. want send 10 20 people site 12 accepted many reasons log avoids that. Never less ask people status ask provide proof many bring hippa laws mumble things like privacy invasion. hear rhetoric vaccinated unvaccinated people.

Edit:

One person even compared Nazi Germany began.  Covid next 50 years Thanks, anti-vaxxers. must _very_ proud themselves.  still effective, possibly even more. believe wouldn’t need third shot 6 months second dose. would confirm pharmacist/healthcare provider situation somewhat unique, I’m 95% sure that’s correct.  Sure, place like US, surges happen regions. every single town supply beds, town 500 6 hospital beds, per capita rate great. stochastic effects could cause problem. One bad car accident exceeded hospital capacity couple days people needed attention. 

The current surge Gibraltar almost order magnitude worse US right now. unreasonable know happens super-sharp spike leads sudden short-term high demand hospital beds enough capacity.   second shot pretty bad. take easy tomorrow I'm sure I'll better weekend. Oh no! without Theatrical Security Association? Honestly, acted like interested wanted see cards.

As “denying threat upon them” theory/comparison, would think unvaccinated acquaintances/coworkers/ especially immediate family getting sick dying covid would enough threat it’s less threat you’d think. I’m seeing lot this. 

The stent comparison different. much equal risk vs benefit stents covid vaccine. everyone makes decisions contribute poor heart health. genetics many non-modifiable factors go needing cardiac stents. 

Dying covid chose forgo vaccination nobody’s fault like hereditary heart disease be. 

I realize intentions though appreciate comment! Well suggest? rich Austrians? adjust based income? see lot rich people “woo” refuse vaccination. fine would affect them.  article says another lockdown.

However, county preparing compulsory vaccination. 

Here article that, here...i think I'll roll dice time. I'm going every 6 months people can't supposed do. vaccinated going deal annoyance 50+% population world continue nothing get sick again? wife symptoms second, none third.

I compressed flu second, basically like 18 hours fever, exhaustion, chills etc. utter awful day, gone next day. exactly third. started caring much less kind thing biggest ""downside"" anti-vaxxers dead anti-vaxxers, big loss.  Especially kids eligible (at least U.S.) 

Though wonder Austria continuously shattering daily COVID records 70% population vaccinated.  periodic lockdowns provide opportunities outbreaks things inevitably open up?   Sue unvaccinated human rights violations mean?

Because work per article one - declaration addressed states, individuals, groups, cooperations (or collective think state). number non-mRNA vaccines...J&amp;J, Sinopharm, Sinovac, Astra-Zeneca, Sputnik V, Novavax them. think J&amp;J currently approved US.  may job opportunity infront interact customers (Obviously still proper covid protocols) working remotely last couple years wondering anyone recommend good reusable masks? least certain things look purchasing new masks?

Sorry delayed response buying groceries.

Out curiosity got tested antibodies three times. family one thing common far: 
Ever since getting infected amount antibodies within bodies steadily increased seems keep increasing. 

I see two possible explanations: 
Either immune system still naturally producing antibodies ongoing reaction unnoticed infection family doctor suspecting came touch virus multiple times without noticing. Either way seems irrational scared reinfection.
As I’m stacked teeth antibodies seem keep increasing.

I see reason get vaccine slowly starting lose efficacy two months producing even antibodies naturally confirmed tests we’ve undertaken.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I’m J&amp;J trial got single dose last December. called two days CDC approval boosters J&amp;J people scheduled J&amp;J booster January.

The second CDC announced J&amp;J people could mix match boosters headed got Pfizer shot. wasn’t willing wait January, especially since I’m coming one year anniversary vaccination.

My first J&amp;J dose kicked butt 24 hours. Pfizer booster gave sore arm little tiredness next day.

I reported trial got booster pulled 28 days draw blood study me. question: happens 6 months now. going every 6 months 3 months drug companies come study says 3rd shot protection drops X amount? point say f-it...i'm every 6 damn months. Right, everywhere checks vaccine status. places lax others, especially outside main cities go (as everywhere). Rural people give less fuck. CDC ACIP consistently infuriating. all. Makes sense, thanks!  Thanks, makes perfect sense! sad likelihood Germany lagging, showing us future. Clearly miscommunication going here. thought antivaxxer.

I believed statement “booster narrative bit off” mean believe booster shots effective preventing infections.

I also believed linking previous article, discussion decreasing antibody titres, time believe would lead decrease immunity, indication belief immunity waning vaccination.

Thus thought effective way show protection infection vaccines waned several months, booster shots help restore protection infection, would r/COVID-19 subreddit.   terms case spread, see case well vaccinated places.

My state \~82% partially vaccinated, \~73% partially. rate remaining eligible people getting vaccinated, excepting 5-12 year olds, low, dealing tiny amount people die-hard anti vaxxers, resistant unmotivated, better part year budged.

Of people likely produce hospitalizations, 99% already vaccinated.

So, either try get maybe 5% people get vaccinated (and accomplish that, know, given push already exists), get 75% rational people double resistance harshest season spike. mean, original article shit, one also is. spend lot (correct) time talking confounding factors, write shit like this: vaccinated people, less COVID.

which utterly wrong. might true specific area specific point time, generally speaking, wrong. 

They'd right said ""where vaccinated people, less covid **all else equal**."" in, take exact population exact conditions split two, vaccinated group gonna fewer cases. scenario clinical trial, real life. real life never ""all else equal"". fact, ran similar analysis pretty much whatever country choice Europe, get ""interesting"" results. LOT variables differ much places end completely masking/hiding effects vaccine.

So:

1. vaccines reduce cases

2. fucking correlation vaccination rate number covid cases geographic level, state, county whatever.

This article never cited (cit.).  idea, anecdotally working people even works great, ate burnt orange. COVID solutions compatible notion ""freedom"" are: 

1. Granting citizens freedom shoot unmasked persons encounter public ""self-defense"" doctrine
2. Granting medical practitioners facilities right refuse treatment unvaccinated FOIA requests require serious amount time. simple ""Oh, here's stack. fun.""

They dealing proprietary information exempt release (trade secrets) since also involves medical trials, probably also contain information subject HIPAA. data scrubbed PHI (personal health information).

So, essentially 300000+ pages data go limited resources make happen fast. Welcome everything.   awaiting kidney transplants cancer treatments also sue back? ""Oh but, yeah, they'll die they! Oh well, problem, right?""

I'm vaccinated I'm side facing backlog. Yep anything fried.  UK spread natural immunity  either Every one them? That's worrying. Last heard Britain hospitals seeing [60-40 unvaccinated minority. That's mainly many unvaccinated left country, are, mostly young.

I've heard Germany bit behind vaccinations, extent unvaccinated still form overwhelming majority hospitalisations? something else going - maybe larger contingent older people refusing vaccines?   nonsense helps guess quoted another comment study's co-author, appears something malaria infection *itself* affects immune response covid-9. merely issue malaria survivors younger pre-existing conditions. Here's relevant passage senior research advisor Jane Achan: went project thinking would see higher rate negative outcomes people history malaria infections that’s seen patients co-infected malaria Ebola,” said Jane Achan, senior research advisor Malaria Consortium co-author study. “We actually quite surprised see opposite — **malaria may protective effect**.”  said may suggest past infection malaria could “blunt” tendency people’s immune systems go overdrive infected COVID-19**. research presented Friday meeting American Society Tropical Medicine Hygiene.

Um diese Freistellung habe ich mich tatsächlich vor Monaten schon bemüht. Der dafür zuständige Psychiater stand der Impfung äußerst kritisch gegenüber und hat für mich sofort einen Antrag gestellt. Der Antrag auf eine Impffreistellung wurde allerdings abgelehnt. 

Wenn solchen Anträgen stattgegeben werden würde, stünde eine Hintertür für jeden offen, der die Impfung verweigert.

Es würden die Menschen bei den Psychiatern Schlange stehen, tausende hätten plötzlich psychische Probleme und das Ganze würde unterm Strich weit über das Ziel hinausschießen.

Maybe there's element underreporting cases well. I'm glad access vaccines now. got second shot week. everyone lucky. did, really, data super compelling support mixing matching. kind took gamble. 

If going see family Thanksgiving, think important make appointment soon possible, rather try hunt specific brand.  No, though doses dropped slightly. seeing children vaccination threads now. ""The risk low children, I'm going sit out"". know lower risk? facking vaccine.

My brain hurts.   doesn't. Vaccinated people protest too. deserve punished right thing  got Pfizer bad second shot. Still pretty crappy atleast totally count. Ok headline says FDA approved.

Oops speed read. I'm work. 

I wonder full approval Moderna mentioned anywhere all. submitted around time Pfizer. 

Personally, I'd feel little better moderna shots approved. Good. worse. pastor telling followers ""persecuted"", feel bad outbreak deaths, feeling ""Satan trying drag us down"". Thank you. corpses hall way still one biggest bs stories there. quick, easy way longer one poor, ""hated"" unvaxxed 🤔 think may seriously misunderstood something kindergarten math class. really hope come way avoid side effects. go booster Tuesday call work 2 days recover. Atleast bad second covid shot, one sick af. looking forward possibly deal every 6 months. likely time infectiousness shorter well, would also reduce incidence. Plenty reasons get jabbed. Can't help think bad-faith redditors like, ""Why TRUSTING CDC like always tell us say need boosters?"" damn obvious science data supported boosters, yet premier national health organization refusing acknowledge it. booster EUA per link. Yes. vaccine ever 100% effective. mandate mean anti-vax. Learn difference Wow, I'm shocked read this, insult country. definitely using something unapproved. need upset dude. life choice. absolutely wrong choice scientific perspective.

Here fun reading you, right front page. Read  could data incorrect. Cases under-reported due poor healthcare infrastructure.

While factors may play role, least, young population lowering death rate metrics, think money's lack health infrastructure adequately assess impact pandemic extent severity part.

I assume genetic factors might also play role always finnicky hedge bets on. think calling everyone hesitant vaccine anti-vaxxer definitely problem. many people medical field still skeptical.

Anyways, however big small unvaccinated population is, causing problem. 

We *have* trust science get vaccinated. *only* way. get outta pandemic, long united purpose. need that. That's true, attracts 3 million people year, I'm sure significant number people would utilizing public transit, tourists who'll need hotel rooms. Wouldn’t default position won’t last? would need evidence won’t problem again. Anti-vaxxers indeed main reason numbers rising, along winter people inside. look hospital stats - vast majority unvaxxed. yes, let's look Japan. 76% vaxxed. Everybody wearing masks, also outside. problem them. many cases Tokyo yesterday, city 12 million? Nine cases. people behave care society whole, there's need vax mandates. sometimes people wild, irrational, sociopathic, use strong arm. ok, fam. will. Thanks permission. Fam. Moderna booster approved, standard 2 shots not?

Did miss approval?  fit common Delta strains Europe probably around R0=8 now. Compared 2018 society, would need behaviors immunities prevent 7 8 infections order cases rise. 

Given immunity wanes, think there's country earth that's close herd immunity. Cautious behavior likely still lot work. people decrease cautious behavior, cases rise. 

For COVID, generation cycle corresponding R0 4.8 days.  
If society acquired 75% immunity vaccines infection (ie, 100% people either vaccinated infected, average immunity granted 75%), society dropped caution, reproductive number would 2. Every 4.8 days, number daily cases would double. thought remains:

***Who fucking cares originated?!***

Is finding origin going get people vaccinated? going make virus go away? going stop spreading?

Fuck not! FB detectives caught origin lost sight fight it. Let sheet show commence. Popcorn hand. going get buried got sense smell back eating truffle low doses nightshades (mandrake, datura, blue lotus, Damiana, ashwaganda, hibiscus, lavender, apples). second person took report this. scientist tell ya worked, maybe could help y'all out. Website [here](http://www.emporiumblack.com) phrase “not yet endemic” implies may become endemic.

No doesn't. means happening yet.

I'm yet 50 years old. imply I'll never 50 years old. work private company delivering projects government clients. Within entities, people already lost jobs, employees fully vaccinated, we're allowed client's sites, hence also lose jobs. We've project delays due key personnel losing jobs result vaccination requirements. Luckily I'm vaxxed. nothing perfect breakthrough infection happens, it’s 10-20X less likely unvaccinated. 

On top that, vaccinated carry virus, reason unvaxxed stick closed spaces right? comparisons fucking dumb unbelievable. Half time think bots taken back fact real... Bad analogy. Humans bodily integrity machines.  Survey state found 66% unvaccinated say unlikely ever get shot. majority said vaccine either ineffective causes fertility issues. sad far misinformation gone neither things true pretty easily debunked people still believe them.   addition sports- cultural events allowed 25% capacity, lockdown areas incidence 1.000+, bars clubs closed next 3 weeks. Contact restrictions unvaccinated. 

Mandatory testing work mandatory vaccination several non-essential bussinesses customer already law whole germany.

All couldve averted putting less severe measures place several weeks ago. saying ""walking storm seeing eyes"". often see ""sich den Mund fusselig reden"" (close english term ""to talk one blue face"") advertised masks even vaccinated several weeks ago. Tja. Read interpretation. Peak viral load similar, vaccinated people less likely infected infectious shorter time get infected. dangerous ground... Highlights 
•Mast cell activation symptoms (MCAS) increased Long-COVID patients 
 
•Long-COVID patients similar severity numerous MCAS symptoms 
 
•Aberrant mast cells induced SARS-CoV-2 infection likely triggering factor 
 
•MC-directed therapy could help treat Long-COVID patients 
 
 
Abstract 
Objectives 
Hyper-inflammation caused COVID-19 may mediated mast cell activation (MCA) also hypothesized cause Long-COVID (LC) symptoms. determined prevalence/severity MCA symptoms LC. 
 
Methods 
Adults LC-focused Facebook support groups recruited online assessment symptoms COVID-19. Questions included presence severity known MCA LC symptoms validated assessments fatigue quality life. General population controls mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) patients recruited comparison ≥18 years age never overt COVID-19 symptoms. 
 
Results 
There 136 LC subjects (89.7% females, age 46.9 ±12.9 years), 136 controls (65.4% females, age 49.2 ±15.5), 80 MCAS patients (85.0% females, age 47.7 ±16.4). Pre-COVID-19 LC subjects controls virtually identical MCA symptom severity analysis. Post-COVID-19 LC subjects MCAS patients prior treatment virtually identical MCA symptom severity analysis. 
 
Conclusions 
MCA symptoms increased LC mimicked symptoms severity reported patients MCAS. Increased activation aberrant mast cells induced SARS-CoV-2 infection various mechanisms may underlie part pathophysiology LC, possibly suggesting routes effective therapy. Easier impose surcharge. We’re lot rational money. spot inflated egos.  I’ve wondering, Covid numbers going up, vaccination among adults stagnated. unvaxxed population going keep catching getting really ill, Covid go away disappear sometimes next year.

Public health officials said 70-80% need get disappear. wait then?  Singapore administering 50 microgram moderna boosters. news, said also applies vaccinated individuals too. case?  Multiple possible factors play here.

(1) demographics African countries young. Young people far less likely severe infections also recover faster.

(2) time spent outdoors, natural ventilation reduces exposure amount virus.

(3) less reliance inter-city / inter-national trade localized economies means slower spread virus trade/commerce networks.

(4) could data incorrect. Cases under-reported due poor healthcare infrastructure. LEGALLY sell them? That's question.

I'm sorry ""person like me"" lay explanation hold scrutiny. think talking ass. really related Famine Ireland people committed crimes intentionally get sent prison reason. Eventually, British stopped sending jail.  treated, dime. like said, cultural dependant, respect that. 

Personally me, I'm uncomfortable it, understand. 

It's bit shit though vaccines turn effective stopping transmission (especially delta) hoped, especially time, really sympathize people want vaccine, addition information. harder convince people perceived risks (new, mRNA, whatever) outweighed benefits society peaking place, high vaccination rates. 

Unfortunately live, government super transparent % ICU unvaccinated, approach code black, I'll dig see released new numbers. Listen, guy, words funky they're damn long. Yes, am, actually. coworker something similar first one, though, much second (also Pfizer). symptoms place. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

What mandatory delousing army insecticide?

 Mandatory vaccination kids go school - since 1930s?

Mandatory use chemical disinfectants skin enter hospital?

Mandatory treatment water everyone drinks bathes omygod chemicals?

You building straw man. WAIT DON""T REMOVE STRAW BODILY INTERGRITY.  limits informed consent bioethics pillars beneficence paternalism. Anyway, there's implicit social contract live society well there?  PCR tests 100% accurate. check doctor recommendation. They'll probably say quarantine safe symptoms go away. can't access doctor, could check subreddit r/AskDocs verified doctors answering questions.    Yeah, happens daily q&amp;as aswell, mention masks vaccinated get downvoted.

CDC quite clear masks even vaccinated incidence higher 50 positive rate you’ve fully resume activities prior pandemic. reduce risk infected Delta variant possibly spreading others, wear mask indoors public area substantial high transmission. areas high substantial incidence lot evil people pushed ugly agendas telling lies contrary  Covid-19 going away. point we'll stop looking infections transmissions, severe illness hospital load. unvaccinated person many times likely end hospital vaccinated person. vaccinated person gets booster 6 months later, chances severe illness reduced even further.

So unvaccinated placing disproportionally large burden healthcare systems. restrictions place combat that. Even though vaccinated person still get infected transmit virus, they're probably going add workload hospitals.

That said, vaccination still large effect chance getting infected transmitting disease. even though 100% perfect protection, still makes huge difference.     Poor you. can't imagine one sensible amongst many deluded people. Wishing best. Maybe cost, expensive take care people's healthcare paying think 80%salary people work lockdowns financial aids closed businesses.   Whooo boy, let's talk USA! Private school DC. way complicated that, vaccine 100% efficacy rate would agree you, doesn't. 

I also happen believe wrong force people get vaccine think wrong face consequences decisions. 

If someone works vulnerable people (like nurses, police officers, like) decides get vaccinated lose jobs (for time being). 

Genuinely, brink disaster like ""go business normal"". couple hours?!

Would disputing parking ticket result time waiting around court house going jail?

Is jail going full people also hours?

Do feed jail? take nap? take vacation day work get paid go jail afternoon?

Does anyone Austria actually pay parking tickets?  one hypothesis really hope proven wrong: 

""...we hypothesize SARS-CoV-2 could potentially oncogenic virus blocking autophagic flux, also leading immune escape downregulation MHC-I. ""  Actually, years ago got speeding ticket. 50 EUR 10h prison. really considered sleeping one off. wife made clear could stay right there, that. government populist fuck - pretty much noone supports full lockdown poland based polls. partial - maybe, full - pretty unlikely CDC United States says get 6 months second shot, wait April 2022. another country, check governments health authorities see ICU beds riddled unvaxxed dying left right survive occupy beds even longer -

People access to, even afford, much mobility move around much rest World. lot less habitants Africa running around place, likely less people travel continent compared continents. Less people moving around = less spread. They're starting draft law. penalties likely announced late January February. There's still chance law go through.  Easier administer too. Easier logistically.

A lot advantages works well. least one country what’s necessary. 3 vaccinations (including booster). pro vaccination get troubles greatly. 


To literally force people vaccine take away consent someone allows body. 


By means place lockdown stop going eat. literally fine potentially jail them... That's messed up. lot factors poorer places general better richer countries. Poor places actually sense reality danger disease. decadent west not. fyi: unless referencing DW (Deutsche Welle) German State media. Öffentlich-rechtlicher Rundfunk publicly fundend state controlled. lot countries mandatory vaccinations. MMR, TB sorts kid allowed go school potentially puts peers risk. Basic social contract stuff.

That's case live think matter shift perspective. course everyone still gets vaccines changing recommended mandatory big change theory. time still feels pretty big, strange. many people think ""easy"" since already similar case mandatory smallpox vaccine, kinda crucial 110% backed constitution,... We've situations decided X find later ""well oops, X line law"". happen time, otherwise everyone big trouble. besides giving people time get vaccinated also making sure done proper (legally) way much longer healthcare systems crippled unvaccinated Covid patients? 

Maybe time ask unvaccinated people sign statement saying agree that, event Covid infection, give right medical treatment infection, get vaccinated. 

 sucks whole country go lockdown over-inflated egos strength immune systems. would fuming happened live. Perhaps side effects common vaccinations especially ones prior infection? Half people including take two days work shots. argument ""yes covid worse"" change fact. 
Here reliable source : 

""A strong correlation demonstrated IgG-S level vaccination, corresponding responses single vaccine dose (r = 0.8, p &lt; 0.001) post infected population. Short-term severe symptoms required medical attention found 6.8% among post-infected individuals, none found infection naïve population. data suggest single vaccine dose sufficient induce intense immune response post-infected population regardless seropositivity. Although short-term safety issues observed compared infection naïve population, single dose regimen considered safe post-infected silly childish, suspect level vaccine hesitancy needle fear based. Pills novel frightening. vaccine delivered orally, expect overall participation improve.

Again, silly superficial. believe would effect. (Austrian) Chancellor stated publicly would never lockdown vaccinated citizens recently two days ago, past weeks/months. Today announced (very necessary) lockdown. yea sure ;)  recover, right? Sure, going happen political shitstorm Even animals get covid transmit humans, going it? Vaccinate every living planet? 🤣 100 microgram 50 microgram booster? Could find info. lying what?  Sure.  Oh yes. Finally mandatory vaccine. Can't wait country same. fact article needs exist makes sad.    Keep mind first mandatory vaccine Austria (smallpox e.g.). Many countries something like (e.g. Germany, measles kids).

Besides shit load vaccines (like polio, tetanus, hepatitis) partially mandatory basically opt-out many people got childhood. people freaking Covid now.

Wanna travel? Uh gimme 4 shots single day! Yellow fever vaccine? Oh yes course, wanna see Africa. (and one asks find yellow fever vaccine SCARY compared Covid vaccines we've got...) ""informed"" stretch here, antivaxxers anything informed. Things slowly cooling Greece, now. 

Don't know happen December though.  I’m fully vaxxed. However don’t think mandatory vaccinations solution suffered Myocarditis 2nd shot Moderna. (50yr old male) Absolutely getting booster. basically asystematic COVID positive prior vaccines release General public USA. felt ""off"" real symptoms feeling normal.  teacher high school wheelchair. said alive *because* wearing seatbelt flew car instead crushed accident. still maintains everyone definitely wear seatbelt. 61% fully vaccinated. 69% one dose.  think freedom ends may hurt someone else, that’s exact reason vaccine (and other) mandates already exist took kids got three shots. Last week kids got shots got booster.  places, need vaccinated tested, dont check properly. look vaccine QR code thats it. double-check ID, online-check, QR code valid forgery. vaccination checked properly time. Levity strikes back hard.  Can't wait see babies rioting. blast. I'm glad see fine, think needs manslaughter charges: 


""One camp meeting participant worker East Cumberland Lodge nursing home Pugwash; virus ripped home, far, 31 residents 10 staff members infected two residents died.

Baptists known legalistic. guess apply actual laws like ""Thou shalt kill."" people freedoms? Freedom choice put body government say that. way government say abortions. right freedom individual.

Do agree?   Covid fun. Got last year time.

And pfizer shots kicked butt. Going get boosted tonight. Ugh.  common think, Netherlands arrested officials making *tens thousands* fake QR codes (and that's they've found!)

Source probably degree biological science medicine. pretty daunting catch people 4 8 years intensive shcooling subject. Plus science happening real time variants coming out. got booster. great. listening experts. almost certainly die. give little longer. Kids getting vaxxed. There's pills shots coming next couple months vaccines gonna reduce risk even top vaccines. combining vaccine, antiviral pills, antibody shots, Covid going nothing couple months. pretty much nothing right boosted 65 years old. “Several health-care workers told that, amid grueling working conditions careers, hospitals cut salaries, reduced benefits, canceled raises; forced staff work shifts longer hours; offered trite wellness tips, keeping gratitude journals, denying paid time reduced hours; failed provide adequate personal protective equipment; downplayed severity experiences.”

This exact experience led leave practice. last 2 years mentally disruptive hospital administrations enacted self-destructive policies telling believe years experience realities around you; “but don’t forget fill Wellness Wednesday survey!”  Whoa! Guess explains transmits easier.  Good

Now need see works within Schengen area… otherwise pretty obvious practical problems and, also, easy way challenge EU level covidiots. 

I would hope european mandate medical exclusions exceptions, long way go get  countries soon follow save healthcare. Germany, Slovakia, Poland...  lockdown 10 days, 20 - translated paragraph says. reevaluate 10 days numbers still high, go 20.   everyone accepts every 6 month thing.
Then it'll quickly become every 3 month thing, monthly... on. treat willingly unvaccinated. made decision. live consequences. refuse restrict due bioterrorists. hoping get risk assessment going visit family Thanksgiving.

I fully vaccinated booster month ago now.

The family seeing fully vaccinated except 2 adamant anti-vaxxers, covid once.

I committed going grandmother getting age don’t know many years left.

Thanks opinions. point bulk unvaxed folk, volunteer scientific study probably negligible cross over.  Nah. Symptoms like sore throat, runny nose cough booster side effects. That's either COVID cold, COVID test negative.

I got booster, caught cold.  Online Vacination Pass, edited government. faked know doctor, willig fake gave vaccine. can‘t buy fake paper one carry transmit they're less likely to. binary yes no.

Also part reason convince people vaccinate without outright forcing so.    Lmfao, latest post:

It’s cold tho lmao it’s worst you’ve ever felt life. Bruh put 2 2 together shot lmao. Maybe didn’t get Covid shot lmfao. Plenty people bad vaccine reactions booster shots way worse second jab. Google lmao barely gained +2.5% full vaccination last 50 days. rate vaccination remained fairly stagnant shots 3rd doses. even uptake area enough, 5.5% population booster. states closed vaccination centres docs full capacity. know someone US traveled Italy recently fraudulent CDC vaccination card (these big thing US) said entering exiting country breeze. Officals didn’t even check vaxx status barely glanced Covid test. hand, recently traveled country records, test, attestation forms submitted prior departure plane there, checked repeatedly upon arrival. vacation resort, protocols intense. would say quite shocked hear Italy become relaxed all. get COVID. lost mine two weeks, insanely disruptive life. husband sense smell years due condition has, I've always sniffer household. means would check milk, sniff food, warn toast burning, identify son poopy, sniff clothes see kids threw clean dirty clothes floor, tell husband needs shower, list goes.

I actually give poor kids spoiled milk, somehow never said anything. husband used milk something evening noted chunky.

My sense smell taste return course day, I'm pretty sure ever return fully. Certain smells missing fullness remember having, tastes smells overall feel slightly duller. I'd say 70-80% was, I'm grateful even much, make worried age one day starts catch combine that. gonna make sound like anti-vaxxer im not:

What's point introducing restrictions specifically unvaccinated vaccinated still carry transmit covid? Always proud ignorance, types.   Hmm coincidence bud 😂😂😂 known tho... come   people dying 🤷🏼‍♀️ hard/easy fake vaccination austria?

It's sadly damn easy germany hope different not? lost sense smell taste, regain 2-3 months. However, recovery, noticed sweat smells onions. matter what, sweat, like onion me. thing goes sister gf (we infected time). Also something cooking house, spice mix used - spice seem smell onions, matter else added mix. Anyone else ? two shots get? going long time news kept quiet it. vaccinated people hospital unvaccinated lot European countries.   Living Austria, expect well. Comment sections social medias (obviously) exploding, also many people supporting this. Currently 66% Austrians fully vaccinated, way low. However, think actual number people gut really oppose mandate (like emigrating, quitting job, etc.) much lower number current anti-vaxxers. asking booster. Thanks explaining moment they're saying refuse face penalties imprisonment (the latter happen, I'm sure). ""Wer sich dennoch nicht impfen lassen will, dem drohen Verwaltungsstrafen bzw. Ersatzfreiheitsstrafen."" Might persistent threat? shit never going away lol. tell pharmacy qualify Kind of, really. It’s confidence interval essentially means taking account random errors, replication study confidently reproduce value 0.29 0.75. (This study produces value 0.47).

Because confidence interval less 1.0, means confident regardless random errors, pretty much replications study conclude face masks REDUCE Covid cases. (By least 25% 71%). 

 margin error large really diminish significance study findings, indicates sample sizes smaller cannot accurately predict findings smaller interval. important interval exceed 1.0, meaning guaranteed research findings due random chance.   Random question losing sense smell taste make dieting easier ? Well, who's fault here?

Querdenker und Spahn body's aching time Maybe covid made farts odorless. Austrians here? said anything done practice? 

Is something like ""take vaccine go prison""? 

I doubt would physically wrestle vaccine anyone's arm. thankfully got approved skin teeth thing start month (arthritis back, abnormal (but heredity) high white blood cell counts, regular steroid injections spine). Blah blah.

All three Pfizer (or joke, little blue vaccine lol) booster sucked WORSE second shot. warned. worth it, get wrong, rough.

The fact American democratic policy general plenty long-lasting, lots policy autocratic states quite capricious. 

Plus, key: current Chinese regime nowhere near old enduring democracies. Let’s use length regime measure here. Everything post-Qing hardly extension prior Chinese governance. 

Lots democracies measure anyway, want talk relative benefits democracy compared autocracy. It’s like US case here, it’s probably one bigger basket cases among Western democracies moment. Canada, Germany Australia far better without major erosion rights. Democracies succeed health policy. say companies like one. No.  come? know British slang getting shot US slang, unknown here, joking getting 'jab' anything need get shot seems pretty common.

If comes across “scare tactic,” even super extreme, feel like blatantly refuse choose get vaccinated absolutely get “preferential” treatment catching it. 

I’ve reading seeing *SO MANY* occasions unvaxxed people sick covid going front line emergency care places, literally jumping line vaccinated people problems, taking critical ICU space, leading lot responsible people life-threatening issues dying it. 

Not unvaccinated people catching, spreading getting killed covid incredible rate, they’re also getting people, emergencies, killed alarming rate could’ve avoided get moronic selfishness get vaccinated. 

I absolutely believe someone found covid **not** vaccinated, moved bottom list far “priority based severity” list goes. 

One stories top head early-mid 30s veteran Houston. started bowl/guy issues, searing pain tried get help ERs ICUs full far 6-8 hours away. couldn’t get anywhere. almost find one last minute, finished paperwork hospital said bed basically said, “sorry, thought did, admit someone covid it’s longer available.” send guy home, effectively telling him, “this it’s gonna be, it’s terrible played out, go home spend time loved ones, I’ll keep trying, we’re basically sending home die.” 

They sent home, within day died... appendicitis. fucking sickening someone died incredibly fixable health issue, literally nowhere space surgery **SO many** unvaccinated people sick covid taking much needed ICU/Emergency Use space weeks, sometimes even months, end die anyway refuse get vaccinated. 

**[Here’s story, cause Well done! Bravissimo! Magnifique! let know prompted call sister watch kids booster shot appointment next week. Thanks extra voice head get done. No. I'm one qualify antibodies  EXACTLY. Go check HCA sub, chock full dead people research!  North east Texas, same. still 25% 2 shot vaccinated, 30% one shot. Antibodies matter. memory T-cells give long term immunity get flu shots every year. annual flu vaccines quite time. wore seatbelt, got accident, seatbelt still gave rash! 

I'll never wear seatbelt again!   difference likely die get incredibly sick 100's thousands dollars medical bills. there's that.  Counter argument, deadly plague general public would far unanimous implementing action. People Covid skeptics they’ve seen friends beat easily assume it’s way people push it, 9/10 people fucked dead dying one would deny  Came say healthcare folk, thank you, right holding together fabric society. selfless job, one know shit go through, imagine. Im sorry live nation fuck sticks privileged life…yes said privileged, “myself included”. seeing military saw war terror wasnt headline anymore…a nation content unending war…more like one cared didn’t involve them, all…thats yalls job, mind set. unwilling, preforming impossible ungrateful. Stay strong! you, goes shit. Thank you, cant say enough,
Thank you. offer risk blood clots covid much higher vaccines. Fyi.   Everyone getting jab  means wearing mask work yes yes holy fuck yes. Stay fuck shop vaccinated want get sick you, damn sick tired masks setting ptsd arse work want gone. work. turns well work starts decline time getting booster refreshes protection. Luckily there's evidence booster protection might last longer initial shots. time really tell.   States opened “overweight” people could always get threshold is… low. don’t know fit Americans qualify.  exclusively them, wear heavy percentage blame, particularly US. would get program would likely R_t 1 consequently health care system staff much better place.

As mentioned above, SARS-COV-2 relatively stable. viruses mutate fairly rapidly consequence reproduction. mutation rate linearly correlated number cases. number cases brought down, effective mutation rate also brought down. antivaxers enabling (though necessarily direct cause of) mutations we're seeing now. continued mindless rejection medicine endangers us advancing mutation rate providing rapid-spread conduit though United States continue resist sane viral control strategies (see vaccine passports mask wearing) travel upcoming holidays.   What?

That sentence really hard parse. mean type regime? You’re implying competence isn’t specific autocracy vs democracy?

And mean “you people,” exactly? It’s meaningless insult here.

Plenty autocracies competent (Singapore comes mind,) they’re typically brittle long run. COVID end someday, autocracy usually doesn’t carries higher long-term risks. It’s always tradeoff security civil liberty, measured thoughtful.   sure want see Wendover video lol. one Isreli's barcode system similar control measure though apparently use risk-based system, like crime coefficient score.  mean... pretty good solutions? Smh. none really unexpected

Yep, remember April May 2020 one doctors working AZ telling media we'd need boosters initial 2 doses.   death kindergartner state underlying medical conditions months ago. enough tip scale vaccinating right away. Statistically, yeah they're better others, way knowing daughter going react gets it. vast majority population aren’t body builders though BMI works fine them. appears can, occasion, impressed. That's one possibility, far certain. Likewise countries second dose 2-3 months might lower rates myocarditis, far certain. 1/10,000 1/50,000 incredibly low numbers really hard sure reversed. Sweet. Hoping similar. Yes, endemic.  ''HNNNNG I'm....I'm.... I'm B-BOOOOOOOSTING!!!!''  different regular cold? Length? Right...  I've heard people severe reactions first vaccine shot got next shot several smaller spaced doses. Ask doctor.  people seem have, certain period time. issue OP mine hasn’t come back properly, except instead motor oil, smells like something spoilt nearly constantly. It’s nearly year :( HNNNGH... I'M B-BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSTING! Israel one largest vaccination rates. summer wave around 60% vaccinated. basically lowest rate per Canada’s EU standards. first roll mass vaccination ones achieve high rate 

No one disputing vaccine efficacy infection wears 5-6 months. literally everyone agrees someone isn’t immuno compromised / 60+ protection severe disease lasts.
These countries continue see waves hospitalizations due low immunity.

I literally stated comment “vaccine great transmission” 
Mind still decently good transmission theoretical 100% vaccinated population waves cases also likely occur I’m sure means, don’t know explain different. guess you’re right. understanding complaints.   What’s deal viruses? Right , guys? Guys?  guy responded confused. He’s trying use hospitalizations per 100k population extrapolate would happen whole state Covid, makes sense. 

Hospitalizations per population constant. rise significantly greater proportion population gets Covid. Read thread want laugh. Crazy.  You’ll amazed even birth control known cause blood clots waaaaay higher rate. don’t think drawing comparison annual requirements qualifies equating them. Yes Covid vaccine significant side effects, doubt people’s reaction booster news driven primarily desire feel fatigued day per year. Checkmate, atheists. vaccinated sample twice N size, contraction rates impacted 13%, even explicitly states transmission rates unaffected vaccine lol. also use individuals risk age groups (peak age observed individual vaccinated population 33 years age) peak age 55 unvaccinated population. sample size alone makes slight change prone margin sampling error, even addressing drastic difference age two populations... hospitalizations fatalities?  pharmacy didn’t ask question. walked got shot. appointment. Meaning back back first two doses causes greater chance inflammation single third dose spaced 6 plus months got triple Moderna boost 2 weeks ago side effects lasted twice long previous 2 shots. Pounding headache, 102 degree fever, dropped 7 pounds water weight 3 days sweating.

Still bad Tdap. shot suuuuuucked. Well, really important.

Which need able rely organizations government entities certain data message put out.

People rely information keep around safe.

Objectively speaking, government done awful job communicating throughout terrible thing.

We can't expect tell future, able rely critical data minimize uncertainty release information. I'm hoping approved dec 3 6 months her. got first day eligible too. Oh boy...  micromanager boss legit went loco covid couldn’t pop hover pester people per usual. wanted daily ‘check ins’ ‘coffee chats’ attend every fart gurgle meeting stay relevant. stress level plummeted since left. work still getting done. Tell data determined. order compare disease symptoms without vaccine vaccine, person would experience situations physically possible. say vaccine actually reduced symptoms person would mild case without it. Jesus man... booster kicked ass too. expecting hit hard, every joint body agony like 8 hours. whole arm broke rash around injection site too, lasted days. Ditto. Felt like bad case flu. went nothing full blown hour, lasted 6 hours, disappeared almost quickly. Everything crazy.    Covid 10 months ago. smell starting return normal still 100%  hilarious tbh. 

Let’s say 100 town 20 Covid, 5 hospitalized Covid. 

That’s rate .5 hospitalizations per 10 people currently, right? 

If 80 people town catch Covid, many would expect hospitalized?

According math, would expect 5 people hospitalized (.5 per 10 people across 100 population.) 

But reality, 5 hospitalizations 20 cases =.25 hospitalizations per case, means 100 cases, could expect 25 hospitalizations. 

You’re confused. You’re eligible. say work high risk environment. Anyone wants one able get one now. want ppl boosted they’re going check.  annoys seems like government dishonest. almost seems like whole ""you buy masks"" BS knew supplies low. booster recommended healthy people, recommended healthy people ""high-risk settings""? immunity go healthy people? I'm less likely die mean want permanent health risks get sick. indication open booster possibly tomorrow everyone. studies 2 months ago decide get booster everyone bad studies? likely answer government dishonest wanted make sure enough vaccines higher risk groups. question government expect anti-vaxers trust government vaccine safe keep lying convenient them? /rant flu shots knock 2 days

flu shots near high adverse reaction, too.

I'm pro-vaxx, took vaccines covid, whole pretending flu shot covid shot thing nonsense. Can’t take what, part century pandemic science constantly evolving? Grow up. likely corporate decision. didn’t reaction first round, better stick risk reaction different manufacturer. get paid either way. It’s still early, initial study’s showing getting moderna instead 2nd j/j example produces much better immune response hopefully better protection

Source:I’m pharmacist  Requiring people office least one day week (like mine will) means people thought might nice actually get crowded expensive urban centers live somewhere afford forget unless want 3 hour commute.  Also sucks couples specialized careers pick one place other. don’t need wait them. schedule one rite aid/cvs/Walgreens. say work high risk environment check. tests frustrating. Mine came back negative feel like it. don’t issue. comment wrong relation said. going keep buying stuff keep selling, whether one paying tab. got vaccine. I'm vaccinated. want keep moving goalposts fuck em. Lots people motivated spreading misconception order hurt confidence.   Next up: we're starting see uptick death among people taken first booster. 

This dude really told fully vaccinated people wear mask turning around saying actually fully vaccinated unless got booster shot. Less deaths much information means protecting now.   mean someone got j&amp;j Pfizer/moderna booster? ""You'll nothing happy.""

Not even immune system. situation today. Started feeling crummy earlier week, took at-home test yesterday negative, took one today positive. fully vaccinated since late spring. Hoping symptoms stay mild now/improve significantly next days. went booster someone starting series, went flu shot, guy getting J&amp;J. least new doses continuing. get shot Friday night Saturday? head far ass. hoot. Carry on, bud. Goddamnit. issue? here. Got Moderna booster two shots pfizer. toughhhhh. body ache, headache, fever crazy. Imagine covid is. People anti-vax downvoting looking forward mandatory family visit coming week.. would end? like saying flu pneumonia end. stay.  really. apt person said always look sides. sides what? things two equally valid sides.

This one them.

Your brain work. something that.  strongly suspect reached market inadvertent introduction someone connecting nearby Wuhan Institute Virology, 11 miles away. speculation. Local authorities allowing independent investigations Institute makes think Institute could connected. I'm Wyoming - nobody ever wore masks beginning. got booster today though! Yup uncertainty surrounding virus like something horror movie. airborne not? Fatality rate? treat sick people, etc, etc. Yea, no. one changed vaccine means. You’re full crap. said Fauci extension, agency “lied”. Government officials lying intentionally mislead public conspiracy.   Quite reach… literal shit analogy……… shitty people resist put piece cloth face. youngest (6) asthma autoimmune disorder got day released. even sore arm. 

Older 2 (14/13) sore arms that's it. 

My booster bad second tired. vaccines, 2nd dose 6-12 months first dose. However due exceptional circumstances, effort made get much immunity fast possible. went 4 week spread.

We likely see third 6 month dose provide better longer protection. still probably need additional boosters like vaccines several years. got COVID exactly one year ago taste smell still back normal. would say 70% recovered. don’t know new normal?  Right!

But also getting voted... What's going on?

Who remember sheer panic northern Italy hospitals hit rest Europe New York *hard'* (bodies loaded refrigerated trucks, etc)... gotten shot yet? asking get booster? Either way likelihood poor outcomes getting sick goes scenarios. 20s low risk got vaxed believe covid dangerous trust science says vaccine safe effective. brainer. see getting vaccine risk reward, even risk vaccine, risk without far greater comparison. also want risk dying like fish water spreading someone care without everything could prevent that. scared die, however scared regrets, dying manner. one single vaccine free. didn’t pay it. government did. exhaustion showing even super liberal area still mask mandates. I’ve quite places don’t enforce mask rules. I’m vaccinated doesn’t bother me, people giving here, can’t imagine elsewhere. don’t know single person planning spend holidays without friends family, one states best quarantine mask compliance. absolute worst part loss smell taste. I'm lucky came back mostly unscathed, I've heard horror stories people sense taste/smell change worse. That's quite reach.

Also, still visible poop hands bad job washing first time, maybe would indeed go back second go it. true studies show ""mixing matching"" boosters original shoot effective? (i.e first two shots modern, get pfizer booster vice versa?  pretty certain 20 days legally reevaluated 10 days. Usually took 2 weeks see effects cases still high enough 10 days justify another 10 days.  little late good reason, thank making right call FDA.  they're wrong... gender reveal party gone wrong.

bacteria boy, virus girl lost leftover crumbs naïveté last 2 years. parts preventing shaming country like West Taiwan made hearty chuckle. 

Congrats staying hopeful innocent. Haha, awesome actual headline. Even non-argument
No thing long-term side effects vaccines. Vaccines medicine. take extended periods time. Thusly harmful metabolites accumulate time causing long-term side effects. might concern long lasting side effects myocarditis. even non-argument since risk developing myocarditis due Covid infection far outweighs risk developing due vaccine. Plus long-term long lasting side effects Covid far worse severe vaccine could ever be. mention still know else Covid causes flair 40 years time infected wreaking havoc them. certainly know happen vaccine. Plus risks infection magnitudes higher vaccine. literally one single argument getting shot. Except immunocompromised etc course. Well look Austria now. love people cant comprehend new laws would work practice isnt already million laws place enforced. Exactly that. anti vaxxers said would rather get covid take vaccine. happening speak Tirol Bavaria. bet mostly due West central heating/air staying indoors.  GO GET EM

Let’s keep covid ropes decent winter I've read 1 1131 treatment arm Pfizer trial children  Really going limb there.  avoid LHR worst airport making connection either real hassle transfer terminals clear customs make tight connection, good luck that.

I feel like lot people going without really understanding it. Really? Interesting.

I'm Finnish, course also vaccination program like countries. think parents could decline vaccines child though, inclined, without penalty.

Is similar fine imprisonment vaccines Austria? put brown sugar apparently. never heard today someone posted link seems really work  Thank you.  Vaccinated couple months, got COVID lost taste/smell - 2 weeks now.  
At least hard symptoms, this. Still sucks really hard, tho.  hope so. would miracle/light end tunnel. variability airport, also depending whether flying US airline EU airline. Schiphol traditionally less stupid average Heathrow, presumably despite KLM's presence far less international transit hub perceived ""high risk"" countries like LHR is.  people Austria support mandate left say trial sample size was? Article doesn’t say. understanding vaccines (not these) rare serious side effects benefits outweigh risks huge margin. People highlighting risk benefit agenda. I've stickers BA flight Heathrow New Orleans transfer Chicago. I'm back forth Scotland try avoid flying Heathrow queues, typically transit Amsterdam now. time doses helps side effects. immune system already edge 1st dose 2nd one quickly first probably elicits greater immune response.

I’m bit worried myocarditis want avoid side effects. eat well exercise daily, believe stronger-than-average immune system. take chances virus get booster shot? understand statistically speaking risk heart problems Covid higher vaccine, feel weird getting booster mRNA vaccine new; don’t really know long-term effects type technology, right? maybe reading many anti-vax comments Instagram   Perú Chile stickers part signal determine whether searched gate allowed board plane. 100% security theatre. 

I take sticker well (which trigger gate search even ""cleared"" before), moot point always get flagged search 100% time anyways naughty flag CBP/DHS database somewhere. 

This whole ""interview check-in"" process done private contractors behalf airline (who turn complying DHS/CBP regulations that, follow, issues cleared land US.. essentially extension DHS). *most* airports longer mobile check international inbound flights US (although exceptions, based arbitrary risk scoring guess). 

I used commute London US weekly work almost *two years* every time scored high risk go search, Heathrow back upon arrival US CBP. *this week* going week decide blow plane guess. Or.. smuggle something in.. even though.. know get searched CBP 100% time.  Adding fuel anti-vax fire imo. Gschichtldrucker new wave Delta mutations? Nope, would confiscated money, car valuable things put prison sum up, lot western people “individualistic” point selfish weren’t brought “community” mindset. think they’re smarter experts give 70 pieces showing something good go way find 1 piece shows bad use reasoning. literally go beyond way selfish. feel like wholly done American community lol. guess least 1 ESSENTIAL know EXACT place appeared. everything go away /s.

Scientists deal account known bias risk unknown bias time research. automatically make research bad. think overestimating effect effect politicians words people actions situation. Sure think politicians still encouraging people get vaccinated take reasonable precautions. choose get vaccinated resist level precautions limit spread covid listening politicians warnings hospital beds filling up. Yeah   response comment building strawman arguments, turn around even bigger strawman?  thnx countries should. Correct I'm wrong, vaccines measles, rubella, mumps mandatory Germany?   That's article says. FDA authorizes COVID booster shots U.S. adults

That include children 5. taste screwed too. Coca cola tastes like metallic / acidic flavour. weird acidic scent certain deodorant citrus fruits like sweet lime   ✨drama✨ got booster two weeks ago. I'm 37 looked underlying issues get qualified high blood pressure one them. high blood pressure said one questioned it. 

Strangely, second shot back spring hit lot harder booster. almost side effects. Sore arm little tired half way next day. Got daughter first shot around time, 9. Words can't describe feeling nearly completely inoculated family. That's government argue data long-term side effects seriously, point, trial groups what?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  got mine 5 months. saw Israel it, wasn’t wait USA’s slow-moving bureaucrats decide me. went CVS, gave questions asked September.  Sounds like making rules go along I'm anti-vaxxer? 
The concern there's political party holds sizeable amount far right.

I'm pretty sure need explain means.  detecting gas leak something burning. Im sure 91% data highly suspect im going assume garbage garbage out. 0.2ml per dose IIRC. bottle significantly smaller look side side. Great news! got mine Wednesday evening. Much less side effects second shot. 

So glad booster now. Absolutely. Countries already mandatory vaccines (polio such) protests covid vaccine. So, course, country like Austria - mandatory vaccine require children vaccinated attend school - see lot push back making vaccine mandatory. Good, late. FDA (and CDC) unaware major holiday coming less week? mean, literally hundreds good studies, people going fight every step    GoF wasn’t particularly “scathing review” lol. mainly stating need better research PHSM (which totally agree with)- could literally picky covid study isn’t encompasses every single PHSM. also, comment threads misinformation/anecdotes usually pulled r/science, assume comment thread one other. travel docs best. said problem get 6 shots one sitting told ones. Kind interesting people vaxxed really sick covid. one vaxxed person didnt get covid. survival rate bud. Everyone knows majority people wont die covid. idea life long side effects occur virus even mild case. need take deep breaths turn turn joe rogan/alex Jones podcasts bro.  would global flu pandemic brought world halt freely available vaccine.  FUCKIN LET ADULTS GET BOOSTER THEN!?!? 


I'm sitting FL waiting get booster... 2nd dose pfizer 7months ago godammit..


I'm ready waiting allow it.  debating nursing home nurse. said 15 elderly patients COVID right now. said, obviously vaccine work. goes tell everyone sterilized couple years it. 

I said, still get it. vax helps severity lowers infectivity. said, still sick dogs. said, course f*cking old covid crying loud dead (swore cause getting irritated 😮‍💨). said, problem generation calling ""f*cking old"" people held country, care (she understand rage lol)... said, vaccinated then? putting much bigger risk cause ginger vaccination protects old lowers transfer infection. says, wear PPE get me. like, doctors wore PPE pandemic still got spread it... says, accidently giving people covid vax instead flu shot- population control. years people start wiping concludes with... 

I degree conservation biology. women degree nursing. thinks this... would understand came science debated it, straight like population controlllll ahhh!
If case pfizer, private company, take funding US want say mucking science... anything, covid population control senario Whatever makes sleep better night. person isnt vaxxed got covid. tell didnt even know till got tested work.    matter comes from? Butte, Montana Argentina Zimbabwe, it'll still work way here. Well, vaccine injected muscle we're causing confusion muscle, think make swole. Arnold said so.    sounds completely wrong. asked covid recently I'm currently pregnant. No, booster make infertile. Diphtheria vaccines

some Hepatitis vaccines,

Hepatitis B vaccines

Hepatitis C vaccines

Hib vaccines

Pneumococcal vaccines

Polio vaccines

Rotavirus vaccines

are given series. often read ""this country seen spike far compared neighbour countries"" revert time later. Italy vaccinated rate like Netherlands cases got high nonetheless.  feel booster? reactions first shots? first one sucked second one nothing Thanks that.

It definitely better Covid i've seen however know long-term problems yet any. still several issues appointments finally coming here. need studied years normal circumstances circumstances dire?   Good know, this. ""hangover"" booster significantly worse second Pfizer shot me, still worth course. Dude swear God everybody seen exact shit including took Pfizer side effects Moderna 1 day shitty symptoms. difference nanolipitids... two virtually indifferent vaccines huge difference side effects. Yup, lot people seem way way comfortable. Maybe I’m older remember 9/11 concerns that. would catastrophic, think plausible quite unprepared. Latest saw boosters it’s 65, know opened everyone? wtf? adverse effects first two? think there's major issue it. 2nd moderna shot laid day anecdotes I've heard 3rd shot less reactions 2nd shot, however went individual. Combined flu shot needing get chores done figure I'd wait week I'm busy case hits hard again.  Diagnosed Sept 28th. burnt orange. Still nothing. antivax folks going field day one.  certainly sucks lasted months still lack taste smell lingers still could much much worse. Lung damage worse. fatigue sucks too. able get appointment local CVS middle-of-nowhere Texas. don’t think wait. think? 100,000 downvotes anything true, 100,000 upvotes anything false. Well obviously would like it’s realistic. negative test nice compromise.   Okay. Done. need reliable meds catch Covid.

""An ounce prevention worth pound cure""    tried sign booster Kroger, got first two shots said no. tried CVS got appointment right away. buddy 20's went Walgreens paper list conditions, like health issue, work health care facility, questions like that, said yes. specify one yes, apply. None did, still said yes got it. Nobody forcing take flu shot risk losing job. 35 never took flu shot dont plan either. guess lol that’s pretty easy requirement.  Imagine people lost jobs ""vaccinated"" feeling truth coming called vaccines squat. keep seeing vaccinated people saying got covid dont major complications didint go hospital like proof vaccine working. know dozen people real life got covid vaccines even existed never go hospital either.   can't tell r/boneappletea think? Yes absolutely is.

Yeah comment article. says there’s increase hospitalization among fully vaxxed who’ve booster. no. proof vaccine negative test. banning unvaxxed. different. number supplies get countries entirely outside control voting politicians sympathetic already got flu shot Pfizer booster time. wait? phrase “not yet endemic” implies may become endemic. highly improbable.  masks anyone video, people clapping Biden's mandate, shouting ""Brandon"" background. clear day DeSantis wants political aspirations never really vaccine virus itself. 

I wish live people think they're better medical community.  Booster received yesterday. real reaction dont baby, get literally free shot.  children clinical trials early birds. That’s vaccine got approved.     You’d flipping someone shot parade kids killed one. kids get long Covid even initial infection mild.  thankful, alternative massive salary cuts  Ever heard ""sweating disease"" epidemic? put 35000 quarantine even get infected, hard test positive one day. virus need time grow

They need quarantine weeks perform many rounds testing ensure missing positive

Even vaccine 99.9% efficient, one missing positive lead future much infections

ridiculous people Shanghai still get kind wrong understanding FYI: choose either Pfizer Moderna booster shot even J&amp;J previously. Pfizer less effective Moderna faster recovery time getting injected.    Vaccines don’t side effects present two weeks.

Especially mRNA vaccines. statistically impossible side effects present ~15 days. literally doesn’t happen never has, reason think would.

You putting family danger delaying logical reason.   requisite testing; normal red tape.

The FDA strictest requirements world.   It’s 5 years older needs vaccinated. look Japans south koreas numbers realize masking works. done done US would seen 30-40k dead instead 760k.  need years study approval cases?

Thanks, I'm good now. ""Today, smoking gonna save lives""

-Dwight Schrute  ""Negative proof"" drug testing works rolling something anyone, much less global population. proof safe order distribute it. Even shown effects now, clearly shot needs taken every 6 months moving forward could absolutely effect revealed need draw line somewhere. not, cannot allow US become dictatorship.

Well that's quite literally doing. line drawn forced inject something body will. matter think person dumb, government's decision.  Either COVID goes brrrrrr people get vaxxed bodily autonomy protects human dignity much better. choosing die martyr, quite dign.  That's understandable reaction seeing mom's friend die! Luckily able get Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, *no* clotting issues whatsoever, unlike Astrazenica vaccine.  Thanksgiving next week, guess it’s better late midway potential winter surge. people weren’t dying thousands every day, probably wouldn’t pushing booster vax.

So, day future, deaths settles many factors, might requiring making boosters available every 6 months every 1-2 years optional. democracies tend do, yes?

 Making rules exclusive job one branches state. J&amp;J, arm hammer, speed stick, spice men's armpit smell control brink developing coronavirus vaccines....j&amp;j one, funny 🤣. town still it. They're fucking stupid. say get vaccinated,but entire oldtown thats x-mas market tf gonna that? Even vaccinated stupid idea anyway.  North America, here’s crystal ball   understand either. wrong masks protect others, great! right masks anything, lost nothing except dollars spent mask. forget I'm wearing one time (I'm one see wearing one car lol). easy thing can't life understand someone wouldn't. 

I think people like told do. staunchly anti-vax, anti-mask, anti-mandate friend wear unless required ""it's uncomfortable like wearing them."" friend also autoimmune disease. joke. want get vaccinated, go prison. enter vaccinated. Checkmate.  Well, ""Verwaltungsstrafe"" means ""Administrative penalty"", actually longer, leave space efficiency! Something endemic doesn’t mean proper mitigation strategies vaccinations, can’t eliminated drastically reduced.

Small pox endemic. vaccinated eliminated it.

Polio endemic world too. it’s eliminated 98.8% world endemic two countries.

Covid doesn’t behave like those. idea something endemic deal isn’t true.   Makes sense country nationalized healthcare system. Also US stop making gasoline cars 2040. clear see patience unvaccinated wearing thin now. 

If people unvaccinated hurting think people care. Covid virus replicates quicker unvaccinated people, increasing chance mutations (aka new variants). unvaccinated person could breeding ground new dangerous variant also vaccine 33 got booster. shots Moderna. First shot, sore arm. Second shot, chills body aches lasted day, bad enough called work. got booster yesterday I've experienced far arm soreness.

The pharmacist warned that, although booster lower dose, may experience symptoms second shot.

I always think, sure sucks bad reaction it, least get control experience it. get sick COVID, well might experience even worse symptoms, able prepare (planning days off, soup/medicine ready, children significant coordinate them). Combine fact protect others extended time, think booster well worth it. agree every point made Humans like logic facts relevant fit belief system and/or peers. Everyone fallen prey misinformation/peer pressure point. Unfortunately, impact pandemic high.

Eventually, *most* people succumb facts logic but, like said, takes long time. 1. lockdown unvaccinated enforceable. police state. still go work out, say want go work want take walk (still legal lockdown unvaxxed).

2. Yes, protection infection waning. what? Especially boostering, restrictions vaxxed people, harm society unvaxxed people going work getting infected. Infections vaccined relevant society, vacxination rate relevant. Can't say I'm shocked given relatively low vaccine rates adults. utterly unacceptable. hope people Austria protest fucking shit this.. 

I'm double vaxxed, anyone asks. okay, though. peoples choice. another solution? ""lockdown unvaccinated"" enforceable. need 90+% people vaccinated otherwise possession immunological memory SARS-CoV-2 want society functions less normally Delta. can't convince enough people take shot (which proven safe effective) mandate said shot. need, Covid already kill skin simply decompose naturally. Problem yoy might carry around spread others innocent. 




Any mentally functional person would get vaccines minimise risk getting sick, Polio covid.   Nope, nothing yet.

But Vienna started sending letters date time vaccination unvaxxed. Yes austria one lowest vaccination rates western europe. East europe even worse vaccination rates, e.g. bulgaria. also look federal states austria, germany, italy. lowest vaccination rates highest incidence financial times article paywalled: young population, thats key difference austria, germany.  It’s really useful dump lot sarcasm situation like this. choice “vaccine covid” I’m sure sure parents would choose vaccine. choice “vaccine maybe covid” different. 5-12 kids first shot, think it’s totally fair prefer wait see goes first round kids. Ah see. guess downvotes don’t really matter, matters making informed decision health. yea sucks.

I surprised new go move unvaccinated people say knowing can't get vaccine hospital **IF** they'd even that. still never getting since kitchen sink approach upcoming pills, assuming they'll take developed people making vaccines. LA go event, take PCR test, test negative, prove vaccination, still insisted everyone wear masks despite everyone proving don’t covid, vaccinated.

Now every business going mandated make customers prove vaccination.

Yup, horseshit. I’m tired dicked around. Portugal, Spain Italy seeing dramatic waves striking rest Europe due potentially higher vaccination rates.

I could wrong, think partly due geography fact Portugal, Spain Italy truly entered ""winter"" yet. imagine they, too, start spike mid-December rolls around. Exactamundo, reduces likelihood take trip hospital morgue. Yes, media politicians advertised. can’t blame people believing. Double dose ! like sacklers!  Lol. unvaccinated people, vaccinated, go live life I’m getting third shot 13 days. can’t wait stream Ted Lasso hands  Study England showed 50% decrease persistent symptoms vaccinated people. Read actual study compare news article. people get COVID symptoms 6+ months? study actually say that. Look sample employers last job would try keep lid anybody caught Covid, vaccine policy, didn’t enforce kind masking distancing. don’t care anything money. Same, like puffed flubby!   Yes. vaccine protect delta ? Lol, what? Things change. snarky. that's happened. everything remained initial assumptions held true, would likely correct. like quickly get hot 75 125 degrees. Delta 125, matter planned outfit day based temperature 75 anymore.  We’re approving tomorrow. far honest questions. start loaded one like “the vaccines ineffective variants?” aren’t. waning effectiveness time, vaccines awesome job overall. 

Kids relatively safe doesn’t make increase kid hospitalizations saw delta disappear. spread virus lot unvaccinated. plague. Oh ffs. I’m fucking tired this. saying won’t get booster like seriously?  I'm eligible booster even though want one 🥴  Go CVS, that's did. qualified get booster working RN hospital. showed require show proof even though brought hospital badge. show vaccination card driver's license set.  compared second dose? lot coming within 3 months vaccine though based posts I'm seeing once. get booster less year, doubt much compliance. 3 doses severe autoimmune disease... people like supposed exception. still air, since need data. makes feel better, HPV vaccine, Gardasil-9, requires 3 shots maximum effectiveness.  Unvaccinated kids still spread virus like wildfire.   Vaccines great blocking severe symptoms transmission.
In absence 95-99% vaccination rate going huge spikes. 
Portugal, Spain Italy seeing dramatic waves striking rest Europe due potentially higher vaccination rates.   seatbelt prevent getting car accident! Definitely going wear seatbelt anymore! ripoff! high percentage unvaccinated individuals required closely interact TSA staff order travel air.  got booster today… hoping don’t another awful reaction like last 2 jabs. glad extra protection. 50% seems grossly optimistic.

EDIT read came back business trip Texas, it’s hard tell there’s pandemic all. Zero mask wearing. 

I’m sick selfish people idiotic politicians made mask wearing partisan thing.  Raise children. fun. need it. break away anytime want. get another Pfizer. really data showing Moderna booster significantly better point sway mix match doubts it. Either one give huge antibody boost, there's probably better supply Pfizer doses live. shit never going end. Ack. long got second shot? Feel better! grim something like think would pass **lot** faster current situation. massive amount people would triaged away die, far far less population would denying pandemic (because would pretty fucking obvious present everyone) self-preservation would actually work. we've got ton people going ""well going affect individual level"" much want admit *most right it.* get asymptomatic covid, minor symptoms spread around, socializing negative externalities civilization slowly.

A shit ton people obviously dying quickly horribly ebola going things carrying close normal way COVID is. virus terrible sweet spot incubates really slowly, spready without symptoms, people get problems themselves.     fair, scientists outreach specialists saying ever since vaccine rolled out. made clear vaccine reduces severe symptoms provides good protection Covid, like every vaccine foolproof.

It's anti-vaxxers built strawman argument MUST 100% EFFECTIVE!, crow ""proven right"" breakthroughs occur.

And people disposed listening Tucker Carlson Dr. Fauci medical advice, there's much penetrate bubble conservatism... apartment unit vaccinated place world. 150% vaccinated! said mild infections still matter. Giving boosters people vaccinated least six months increase antibody levels; high level protection infection, there's also far less likelihood transmission.  think better careful make sharp distinction protecting infection that's symptomatic versus protection hospitalization deaths,"" Fauci said. ""I know vaccine worry keeping people hospital. think important thing prevent people getting symptomatic disease.""

Fauci clarifying yesterday preventing hospitalizations \_and\_ infections period important, that's boosters needed.  Keep wearing masks. precautions taken far may driven least one Influenza strain extinction!  Population small say anything deaths.... month. 1 death, would like 10,000 deaths US. cases surging x2.5 week, become much likely death. I’m wait see. question break cases giving 5 year old something lessen symptoms get infected? Statistically age level barely effected. That’s I’m saying. currently live Arkansas I’ve dodging Covid bullets since jump. one wears mask here. one cares it’s mom vent. it’s late. Annual boosters common. multiple doses short period time initial round. probably got one kind kid. 6 7 yr old scheduled tomorrow well. Slightly concerned side effects excited get vaxxed. rough couple years. Yup. tested positive 3 days getting booster. like bad head cold, lost taste congested 2 weeks lung damage lasting symptoms. schedule CVS rite aid private company. CVS gives problems show appointment show California cdph website, one know turned away, dozens people “OSHA’s emergency temporary standard said covered employers must develop, implement enforce mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy unless adopt policy requiring employees choose either vaccinated undergo regular COVID-19 testing wear face covering work.”

This tits right here, that’s employer do, absolutely don’t fire ANYONE, make large inconvenience don’t get it. Fuck make triple mask daily testing, don’t fire them. better yet, offer pay increase incentives vaccinated, alone would get people vaccinated anything almost resistance whatsoever

I’m vaccines, way workers rights pro vaccine. firing people anything medical related disgusts me. People rights morons keep jobs damnit multitasking, good man.
this ☝️ going handy months! Ugh sad. One coworkers even said something ""your government says safe since took shot"". Even face Covid antivaxxer attitude strong, got super sick. Hope feel better soon, even husband! Also shit hits fan. Even 60% 70% stop fucking thing rampaging. False assertion accounts, I’m probably feeding troll. efficacy rate 66% 96% effective depending got booster, chances getting markedly much lower. again. Taking 100% “Do something transmission”

If not, would seeing Israel’s case count cratering. feel like I’m taking crazy pills many people parroting anti-vax “You catch COVID spread COVID vaccinated, therefore must equally likely so”

That’s something falls apart even slight thought. No, offered incentives booster would gotten regardless. infant home I’ve managed keep Covid away entire time would hate going back work thing brings her. yeah barely noticed 3rd Pfizer shots   mean, they’re standing around breathing exhalations thousands upon thousands people. 

Why worry? really horrifying. 99.8% healthcare workers right thing. think anti-vaxx health worker thing magnified internet. got this. foolish enough to. protect know better. That’s wear mask southern place nobody gives fuck. It’s I’m lucky enough able understand it’s important. easiest case make protect can’t, sure.

I mean it’s wearing mask. It’s big deal. I’ll wear long may protect someone else around me, regardless mandates.

The reason mandates exist can’t trust people right should. Much higher support staff ICU patients came say far far know SINGLE country 50% vaccination rate Europe. bad me. 2nd shot knocked ass, definitely got chills slight headache 3rd, pretty manageable. Vaccination rate remains 70%, cooler weather driving people inside, stricter restrictions lagged surge. Several European countries (Austria, Netherlands, Czechia) experiencing similar surges, past repeats, we'll next North America. Even US good number hospital ICU bed capacity even comparing so-called developed nations.  Low vaccination rate contact restrictions real measurements. Everything open. Even Clubs ans concerts people act surprised Indeed. I’m saying I’m happy I’m vaxxed. still sucks getting sick.  sympathize. it’s people don’t care. Way many, most.  ""only"" lol Friend got day. JJ vaxxed got Pfizer. 7 months shots, ended hospitalized. minor symptoms 5 days. GET HOUSE!

but real might husband. You’ve described predicament. two co-workers (unvaxxed) now. One really sick. mom died Covid like 3 months ago Christ’s sake. it! Everyone eligible booster shot US probably week two anyways. People right ineligible part due medical reason. It’s already stated get booster 6 months previous shot. 

Not everyone knows schedule appointment anywhere walk right get shot letting know that’s possibility. they're testing combining flu shot. big deal. Even qualitatively speaking, obvious nonsense claim. like saying ""if smoking bad, one smoke would die lung cancer ever"" ridiculous statement without even considering numbers. media politicians advertised.

Which media outlets politicians said vaccines would 100% effective infection? can’t blame people believing.

Yes, can. do. people choose ignore trained educated experts instead get medical advice entertainers, absolutely blame them. ""A man drink like eat gonna die!""

""When?"" here, it’s almost 7 months shot. Sucks got it, many times vaccine prevent getting before? I’ll never know. goal endless government mandates minority people can’t get vaccinated? It’s like virus going away.  booster needed This. matter identical copy person organization checking verification people listed card actually administered vaccine specific cardholder, enforces consequences matter. one real checking actually honor system, clearly going work.

Also, would company spend salaried worker's time calling 100 different pharmacies doctors offices verify persons vaccination status? probably will, maybe threat could keeps fakes down, thats like wearing mask holes poked front ventilation.

The answer centralized database easy verification aggregates data vaccine administers made available checkers. already exists. vaccine passport. solution done politically areas, national problem, needs national database. reality never going happen national scale point, almost year vaccinations began probably around 6 months since people wanted get vaccinated gotten done, existing vaccine passport systems likely ones we're gonna get. 4.858.037 doses, around 2.3% population. 76% total.  fair, plenty media outlets politicians clearly said, TRUST SCIENTISTS DOCTORS, PANDEMIC BALLS DEADLY.

From podcasters youtubers prime time talking heads, saw unified message pandemic real, deadly, manageable sacrificed bit comfort keep hospitals overwhelmed. 

I course saw conservative outlets claiming pandemic anti-trump hoax, senators refusing wear masks, mobs raiding state capitols protest lives inconvenienced. rightfully labelled selfish pricks.

And try using fishbowl cleaner, horse paste, bleach injections bc health institutions said stupid ideas peddled grifters, media policitians follow agreed stupid ideas.

Again, cant paint politicians media brush. meaningful differences, much reflected infection death rates areas people trust institutions versus disinformation peddlers. virus known cause severe illness people underlying medical conditions. fact disease coming end may attributed fact Japan's obesity rate lower Somalia.  Hey saved trip doctor!  get either. Depressing Oh fancy!

Uh, believe refer us Phans. I'm still convinced boosters really needed people

So, *when worms possible*, using ivermectin helps way antibiotics help respiratory viral infections: help primary infection knocks secondary threat patient.  

And, safe effective doses ivermectin, straightforward approach deworm everyone coming areas worms endemic.  areas worms extremely rare waste time.  course substitute vaccination anywhere world. hope I'm proven wrong, given several countries double (or more) vaccination rate experiencing record numbers daily infections (my country included), outlook coming months looks pretty bleak Russia. 
 
Stay safe!  Yes, lot people thinking: going 2 shots per year every year.

To put another example Austria, vaccine tick-borne encephalitis, get shot1, shot2 3 months shot1, shot3 1 year shot1 (timings critical).

Shot 1 protect much, shot2 give like 80% immunity, shot3 99%. that, get refresher (a proper booster) every 3-5 years.  get vaccinated (as well minimizing crowds masking appropriate) prevent this?

So far, post-booster symptoms note slightly sore arm (not even bad first two) tired usual morning, got up, moving caffeinated felt totally fine. 

It seems still somewhat random like initial doses - people barely feel anything wipes others out. know COVID vs really much it.  Huh that’s new information me. I’ll see find what’s presented, might useful create drug mimic that.  Oh thanks, hadn’t heard one yet!  population basis seems line UK last month - granted Germany around 5% lower first dose rate UK.

Is material difference I'm seeing UK government continuing underplay issue?   data incorrect. Cases under-reported due poor healthcare infrastructure.

A lot poorer countries even records many people died last two years, let alone *how* they've died. person born, live long life die, without recorded government statistics.

The three factors make difference, almost certain extreme lack reporting biggest factor here.  Something else find wild Africa consistently creating antibody resistant variants. 

I'd expect likely happen places acquired immunity... Good Moderna 2nd shot kicked butt. got booster couple weeks ago side effects besides sore arm. novavax probably waiting for. Novavax conventional protein subunit design; ran production difficulties they're late party they're starting pick approvals around world.

It’s table 2 data results anyone get now? wasn’t sure specific age group moment  mean stop wearing mask booster?    Yeah *know* sucks! best we've got right now. I'm sure time goes we'll better options start cropping up, time mad case yet.

For now, reality live in. Science moving quickly possible even global cooperation towards common goal limit. option sucking another couple years. That's is. got j&amp;j July know need booster. got vaccinated first didn’t really side effects except minor soreness. intense booster since it’s different kind vaccine J&amp;J? anxiety I’m worried.  and……. (coughmicroplasticsineverythingcough)  age group, there's plenty data outside trials available now, regardless whether Pfizer attempted obfuscate something. Also, can't find evidence part experimental group received vaccine, documentation actual diagnosis compare study information (even catch-all diagnosis). easily available online videos clearly biased websites regurgitating content, poor means verification historically extremely unreliable, I'll pass those.

And even vaccine cause onset disorder, absolutely going rare complication. COVID cause issues like that, important keep perspective looking anecdotes like these.

And even Pfizer obfuscate data study, things CDC's ballcourt EUA.  Nice see article written actual MD That’s interesting question. know vaccines helped me, first time got Covid last year, got put ventilator, I’m lucky here. don’t feel sick fortunately. I’m still pretty miserable. worst part anxiety, money tight anyway added expenses sick. don’t know I’m gonna make work, I’m new city don’t know many people it’s hard ask help bringing food things like that. TLDR: feel sick, bad last time, worst part anxiety loneliness There's digital app. download it, create account, take picture license, boom, digital ID copy vaccine record. picture counts actual ID state (but state).   2 vaccines lost smell tase????????????? Omfg vaccine do? I'm vaccinated ridiculous wtf     likely. especially hold covid vaccines boosters.  
I'm see malding people hopium though.  One major aspect difference quantities mRNA. moderna vaccines. also, you’re likely side effects booster, regardless one is, far tell. 

I zero side effects first two moderna vaccines. got moderna booster laid day, didn’t get appetite back day three. absolutely worth it. never know sure exact origin virus. narrowed two distinct plausible sources, that's good. 

Luckily, need know precise origin learn best treatments prevention. Masks, vaccines, good hygiene, using common sense gathering, testing exposed, isolating infected, going hospital symptoms become severe. Whether came lab, market, third origin even considered, protocol same. 'MURICA! 

WE'RE #1! It’ll never end huh   Sure consult doctor. Sweden however system go doctor every year get checked out. 

 like wrote levels vitamin supplementation I'm talking anywhere close territory dangerous levels. 

 cases overdosing read like 30 000 IE. take 2000 IE like wrote. yes I'm doctor would dare recommend people going medical treatments own. believe however vitamin C supplementation fall that.    joke   would regret getting vaccinated? claim targeted bioterror incident. Yes, ignore widespread is; cannot conceptualize humans beyond country. really. Tick-borne encephalitis also 3 shots, first 2 one month apart third 6 months later. effective 10 years. too. Heartbreaking can’t take 5 year old things want feel safe anywhere indoors. 

People fucking discourteous idiots live Bay Area masks prevalent good vax rates, people still getting sick there’s still plenty people stupid shit.  studies, one     wife got J&amp;J back 4/8/21. got Moderna boosters week last week. didn’t time case hit one us hard, thankfully 2 days feeling tired sore little slow/foggy.

I kinda feel like I’d like get second Moderna shot another 4-6 weeks like original doses I’m sure really can. might one hypersensitivity reactions. probably talk allergist immunologist it. different types vaccines (e.g. viral vector inactiaved vaccines), might available live might tolerable. yet again, discuss doctor, doctor.

Now, find appointment specific doctor days, question. Ah feel good 30   Honestly, job would petrified Covid. can't wrap head around wanting protection get. Report her.  mother law car crash seatbelt, broken bones, denies car crash bones eventually healed. Man I'm glad UK (Scotland) vaccinating Kids unnecessarily. Unreal. Many people see inconvenience consider wider implications.

Sense taste/smell important survival function. Simple example, smell smoke late, dead. importantly, people get severe food poisoning can't taste smell anything. well-known problem older people (who also seeing well whose memory might confused regarding stuff living fridge four months). problem younger people well. International effort force China crackdown wildlife trade stop obscuring crucial data virus origins? Thank thoughtful reply.

Of course know answers questions posed. getting bit confused info bombarded daily basis. 

Recently, local hospital inquired info boosters. said info, discussion point .( asking would colonize Mars). suddenly within night get flooded info literally run get ( referring country handles things). 

The recommendation get booster soon hit 6 month mark. many questions concerning,you know , waning immunity ,what booster does, helpful be, much protection get, whether protection severe illness infection etc. 

I also hear people extended circle getting breakthrough infection 3 4 months vaccination, know scary. 

Anyway, thank much taking time give insight all. referring delta variant, really matter whether anyone ""decided"" get vaccinated. came India time vaccines widely available.

Besides, viral mutation contributor waning efficacy. confident vaccine-induced immunity would remained strong start if, hypothetically, original wild-type strain still dominant one today? thinking HeLa cells whole history behind it. Good. got J&amp;J May. booster get? saw CDC said mixing OK (US).

What efficacy rate people situation choose mix J&amp;J another booster? booster best?    can't trust documentation, either. people buying covid vaccination cards *with real QR code* little $200. Smart. got Saturday yesterday older kid got positive test back. next 12 days home.

You never know get situation like this. Protect loved ones.     covid is.

No thank you! (*gets anxiety way easily*)   Fuck shit. I’m leaving house. Wow. expected taste/smell symptom 2-shot vaxxed. Wonder studies show long-covid vaxxed individuals. Yeah, cause authoritarian aspects societies moment. He's flat lining.....Nurse, two Big Macs stat! Agreed, goes Switzerland. Yeah, no, leave massive authoritarian overreach ""another time"". never let happen first place, reason. great website. Thank sharing it. admit done goofed. Yup dropped ball again. So, got Pfizer shots May breakthrough infection mid August (mild symptoms, thank vaccine). get booster, so, when? 

I trepidation I've heard get booster COVID symptoms really rough multiple days time next two months I'm either working traveling. guidance would much appreciated! aunt interested getting vaccinated capable. latter half summer, considerably vaccination doses available interested persons. scheduled booster shot 2 days ago, problem. Austria Jan 3 also count J&amp;J legit vaccination unless got second shot different vaccine. Vaccines postponed lockdowns month now, could better booster shots readily available countries (I'm looking Netherlands) EMA slack much approving vaccinations elementary school children. knowing whats wrong sentence, problem #2

longterm effects unknown. think find testing center; really think Walgreens CVS it. fact, tell go CVS, use really simple test tells whether antibodies all. idea Walgreens, would guess antibody test also sophisticated.

[Roche's lists testing centers, honestly, I'm sure easy member public get tested them.

There could options. know [Quest also provides antibody tests, may need dig whether distinguish vaccine natural antibodies like Roche one can. One option ask doctor order antibody test you.

Sorry can't helpful, antibody testing kind mess right nearly user-friendly needs wider public take advantage it. able go pharmacy get one (at least one extremely basic), think demand high enough yet national chain pharmacies give us option. pretty much expected high Covid numbers. Wow I’m similar age thing. side effects slightly sore arm.  I'm mid-30's got pfizer booster 2 weeks ago. felt pretty rough next day, similar mild flu-type symptoms.They lasted 3 days. also population existing hermetically sealed boxes indoor air-conditioning like hotter US states. rules bullshit though. Drug use legalized. Also, there’s difference allowing ingest vs. forcing ingest. best example, imo.


Before get called anti-vaxxer, I’m vaccinated getting booster week. Sounds like perfect storm Germany. Iceland bit scary mystery though.

It'll nice layers (boosters + kids) going Dec/Jan though. well pay also - booster get right? Yeah, well let's deal another time. People vaccinated now, whether like not.  Everything open Britain well, cases dropping.

Hum, according Reuters, UK [a 7 day rate/100k [Germany missing context, still seems considerably worse, UK 64% peak cases. really unusual countries shifted cycles. many those, sadly. many times people refusing wear masks, even use fake DCC scanning apps let everyone restaurants, astonishing.

Meanwhile vaccinated suffering unvaccinated, painfully slow rollout booster shots paired bureaucracy elsewhere. currently sit bar even bad, nurses can't buy groceries long shifts already bad thing. fear gets much worse we're stuck April/May due reaction Hague likely lethargic, like usual.  That's actually much better though. assume people get light get tested notice all?  little girl went Fox News with? one who’s become icon refusing wear mask school Thats rolled pretty much entire time virus ravaged country. made appt walgreens booster. specified got moderna vax Ok Pfizer booster location. checked asked ok said yes. pharmacist going administer shot told didnt feel comfortable giving Pfizer moderna initially even though approved. said personally wanted see testing. denied vaccine based beliefs. illegal?   worse effects 1st Pfizer shot 2nd; except second broke hives. That’s went Moderna booster. We're talking triage, we're talking bodies halls. they? 7 year old got first shot scheduled second 3 weeks. 

However read UK recommending 12 weeks reduce health risks. data here? reason delay it? Sometimes things take time. sure suitable amount urgency this.  Sadly AfD responsible Even though 78% africans

That stat refers north Africa, entire continent. Overall, rate vaccinated choosing protect health “enable whole shit show”?  Take pick conspiracy theories eugenics programs. Anyone forced sterilisation?. things government could ability ignore medical consent endless. no, tell consent actually bad idea. No, defeatist, reality. expected, see respiratory infections, see coronaviruses. see sars cov 2 aswell. Assuming never get science. linked many studies showing it.
Vaccines protect getting seriously ill catching infecting others, risk reduced 0. 
Its pro vaccines argument really, care look post history see im pro aswell.
There another study showing one member household catches covid likely others get aswell vaccines reduce risk greatly. wish different, SAR household contacts exposed delta variant 25% (95% CI 18–33) fully vaccinated individuals compared 38% (24–53) unvaccinated individuals.

around 35% reduction. said, children vaccinated. don’t see point getting snarky people want give week two. It’s off-putting. important factor hospitalizations. Western countries generally 70% hospitalized unvaccinated. Absolute caseloads matter less less people inoculated (no one cares 100k people catch common cold every day example). Besides that, R number also goes people vaccinated vaccine also blocks transmission (albeit good prevents hospitalization death).

And yes, human rights important absolute. moment human right go want (for far activities break law course) impeded order prevent healthcare system collapsing big impact mental health.

Sometimes human rights simply cannot coexist. point example, countries vaccination uptake insufficient human rights freedom movement congregation, human right receiving sufficient healthcare needed human right get vaccinated (in case COVID-19) want cannot coexist together. want retain right 1 2 cannot retain right 3, want retain right 1 3 cannot retain right 2 want retain right 2 3 cannot retain right 1. choice make. opinion retaining right 3 far least damaging choice COVID-19 vaccine proven safe effective causes short term mild inconvenience (mild fever, stiff/ painful upper arm) received (yes, know extremely rare cases severe adverse reactions. Unfortunately scientifically impossible formulate vaccine safe literally everyone). Thats good know, second shot still great better first. i'm waiting next Friday get mine worry work couple days off.

I didn’t go Walgreens though online system wasn’t updated. Got another pharmacy allowed mix match. Must minority guy giving shot made comment switching up.   Everything open Britain well, cases dropping.

The big difference UK continent 40s vaccinated Astrazeneca used Pfizer.

Also, went 12 week gap doses, went 3 weeks. longer gap delivers stronger immune response.

Also, we're mix match boosters they're not. vaccine type stimulates slightly different antibodies. boosted people two types antibodies. people infected recovered antibodies 28 proteins virus, spike protein, 7 million infections. Jetzt schau mal ob sie überhaupt beweisen können, dass die Impfung das infektionsrisiko sowie die ansteckungsgefahr mindert. Gott sei dank gibt es für mich auch anderen Ländern arbeit und Dach über dem kopf. Nachdem ich vor 4 Jahren vom ausland wieder nach österreich gezogen bin um meiner Familie ein schönes Leben zu bieten, muss halt leider wieder weg. Kein Problem. Lasst euch von diesen kasperln gerne verarschen. Ich mach nicht mit. Lg  Amazon get contract use drones vaccinate without vaccine medallion.  pfizer shots made really tired day. Hopefully booster easy. reality nearly everyone ""will get winter"", except make it. even know second point about, shortage vaccines states least. Absolutely. know getting downvoted.  fantastic! scheduled get mine next weekend (its earliest get one around me). pretty excited fully protected christmas/new years! I’d rather countries force vaccines 2 years forcing masks onto everyone Anything done open borders move fuck on. fact, it’s shorter! know triage 3 9 counties, right? Like... average counties still fucking wrong view shit. Keep uninformed view yourself. I’ll tell - convince unvaccinated sign waiver saying get really sick won’t clog hospitals, stroke patients, heart attack patients, children accidents, etc still get ICU. 

Then I’m 100% favor ending pandemic right now. masks, mandates, shutdowns - let chips fall may. 

Please - Let’s this. People trust articles read drudge Infowars epidemiologists? Let’s put real test. Take look antibody prevalence surveys, whether anywhere else. well 90% UK example. means people either vaccinated sick. Delta find you. Stop fooling something that's maybe perhaps able outrun somehow.   Im american know works Canada. That’s I’m disillusioned vaccination rates. always start well well supplied eager crowd gets there’s huge chunk population won’t budge. got Pfizer well exact side effects experienced second shot, plus feeling feverish. (I'm 30.) definitely want get booster shot, would lying said somewhat apprehensive side effects ... Oh that's fine OK. Take number hospitals ICUs Austria, take number covid deaths per day, work many deaths hospital average, tell hell adds ""bodies hallways"". Besides mismanagement, see it.   Let's see Austria mandatory vaccination unfold.

They currently 41.8% double jab.

I'm wondering enforce vaccination half population.

If refuse get vaccinated... strongly doubt enforce without collapsing democratic government. makes clever business sense austria make vaccination mandatory. 100% vaccinated, become number one european tourist destination. People want feel safe travel. want make sure I’m reading correctly. ask Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-COV-2?

Does anyone know national chains like Walgreens CVS it?  Big difference diseases least 10 times higher death percentages covid. draw line? everyone forced get vaccine flu too? not? Good her, acknowledged interest protecting public. [Those got second jab future considered fully immunised seven rather nine months, get booster shot four   CVS near took walk ins willing wait little. went non peak hours couple people ahead me. hospitals full people dying, necessity punishment. literally care anti vaxxers die. Labcorp best accessible place this. get mine medical study it’s quick easy blood test.  That's vaccine, penis. right reject. Comply. may depend state (in Colorado case weeks), would strongly encourage find out. Click checkbox. hide things IG explore page, report disinformation IG unfollow people spreading lies. It’s time take responsibility content consume.  Unfortunately, seem like need stop infections want get pandemic.

For covid-19, extent respiratory virus, important whether caught virus, much dose exposed to. means cases low, even old people comorbidities would probably fine waning immunity vaccine would get sick exposed covid.

The problem gets complicated virus spread much population, suddenly exposed multiple times virus eventually reach dosage immune system capable produce enough antibodies time, end hospital.

So matter great new vaccines be, always limited immune system do, type virus always high enough dosage put anyone sick. Hence, either somehow stop infections, virus big problem foreseeable future. panel’s recommendation would open eligibility everyone 18 U.S., group strongly endorsed shots older Americans saying everyone 50 *should* get booster. previously said people 65 high-risk people get third shot.

So still recommended adults 50, anyone wants get it? reading right?  police family,"" Cheryl Cila said.

It’s arrogance ignorance bundled it’s intellect.  Ahh poorer generally well educated guess STOP RESISTING!  got booster job. requirements asked show vaccine card could add booster lol. fucked day half. Felt way worse second dose. Probably. none paying attention. That’s can’t drop precautions despite vaccination status. really isn’t uncommon, it’s severe outcomes uncommon (pending booster). Don’t confuse lack tracking cases lack breakthrough cases.    sympathy her. Actually, downvoting makes comment invisible, less people see comment.  need things. sore arm flu vaccine was. That's it. Vancouver last week lot covid measures haven’t seen anywhere since 2020. Plexiglass still covering bars, allowing people sit nearby tables, etc. kind lot. Unethical?    No. illegal all.   comply hurt high spread areas, live high risk. literal guidance given high risk person “get vaccinated, act unvaccinated” things get depend community spread. get lot healthy person end, high community spread means higher hospitalizations (yes, even among vaccinated) one risk that. don’t like it, ask keep community spread low? got booster still gathering unmasked unvaccinated? actively prepared participate contact tracing? woke sniffles tomorrow, would take preventative steps make sure isn’t Covid? vaccinate many people per day. already hard enough time without approval everyone else. took like two weeks schedule appointment.  Fair warning all; booster kicked ass worse second shot Pfizer :D Yes masks definitely harm experience that. Places mask mandates usually call “voluntary soft lockdown”. even required businesses areas mask mandates things like shut reduce dance floor space, close dressing rooms, reduce certain activities, voluntarily enforce social distancing, even reduce hours. It’s strange phenomenon go city right next mask mandate completely different world. difference mask mandate, personally can’t explain it. That’s point getting vaccinated, bro. Huh? Vaccination shown give better protection disease catching it. One necessarily immune recovering it. mrna vaccine teaches body spot spike protein virus well creating anti body. 

Also people get infected likelier new variant appear. Possibly ones different immunity vaccine may become useless. way vaccination.   First week basic training every branch, line up, drop skivvies, take dozen random shots **mandatory** continue military, god knows what. Pre deployments, take sorts strange shots god knows depending go. 

If someone willingly enlisted army, let dozen doctors poke sorts random shit, *refuses* get new vaccine.... deserve military, barred sort things. want take shot? either suck get out. got mine yesterday. got booster flu vaccine. pain left arm got flu vaccine.  current moment, CDC advisers recommended approval Pfizer Moderna boosters, appears we’re still waiting CDC Director sign it. go ahead schedule appointment early next week anticipation? I'd still say miracle part vaccine got many worked well year, think that's previously unheard of. Bye Felicia. agree more. think that's lot people pretty upset decision. Remember, places give many vaccines per day. already hard time getting booster approval.  problem know yet. problem people actively discouraging boosters despite us knowing. Health officials saying things boosters extra life jacket, suggesting desire boosters inappropriate. despite nearly vaccination requiring multiple boosters, discourse boosters would likely needed eventually.

This active discouragement boosters obvious many people, causing concerns FDA CDC biased boosters thus handling complicated evolving situation correctly. Worst two FDA officials wrote anti-booster article involved initial vote boosters. legal court case, two officials would rightly recused due inability jobs due appearance bias. Austrian here, everybody knows. obviously last effort end pandemic here, sadly many ""do research"" morons live without mandatory vaccine never end.
 quote heard last week:

""The freedom individual ends restricts freedom others"" Swedes experiencing better outcome current wave

Last year Sweden also winter wave 6 weeks later rest europe, would careful making predictions data. Sweden introduced mandatory covid passes first time anticipation new winter wave  I’m trying accept point that, people, NEVER see sense. think point, God came chariots told knock off, they’d call “fake news.”  fda lost credibility delay. don’t know letter law don’t know says „in theory“.

its based law permit it. forcing people poverty mean fining act society deems punishable: deprive human dignity.

im glad determined human dignity dependant whims masses. freedom ends encroaches freedom everybody else.

Which precisely vaccine mandates unethical. quote goes one way - unethical *do* something impacts freedom another person. keyword *encroaches*. getting vaccinated action, *do* something, defined lack action, definition cannot *encroach* rights anything all. however encroach peoples rights mandating vaccines. understand it, vaccination rates significantly lower east, far right AfD flourishes, similarly post-Communist regions. Well look rural counties even lower; easily less percent. urban areas rates closer 3-4% still pretty dang low. twitter thread interesting...Think that's first time I've seen expert actually give antibody level think enough neutralize Delta. take gospel, posted (extremely confusing) graphs back up. think will, reasons (some echoed responses comment). One fear injecting something body (who likes stabbed, honestly?). pill, people used taking pills. 

Second, used sick. Many people didn’t get vaccine also think “they won’t get Covid” “if fine”. time get it, many get scared want treatment. doctor says “take pill you’ll get better”, I’ll bet good money they’ll thing swallowed doctor finishes sentence.  Probably lockdown initially unvaccinated all. 20 points first US news channel mistakes Austria Australia. bruh Probably many people traveling internationally Africa right now?

You implying studies somehow legitimate. misinformation. really suggesting studies reviewed FDA CDC make decision? point say f-it...i'm every 6 damn months.

Do need make even explicit you? Eh, assume you’re referencing NIH mix match study, used original (100 mcg) doses moderna that, said difference still pretty small. Yes, moderna booster (50 mcg) still almost twice dose Pfizer, don’t think say sort conviction switching would meaningful difference. Sure it’s possible, it’s possible would negligible. And, original point stands general guidance still stick whichever original mRNA vaccine got. big deal somebody wants switch, I’m convinced make significant difference one way other. third Moderna shot side effects nearly bad second. Second bed day fever, fatigue, aches, etc. day third shot headache, general fatigue, aches could still function. mandatory vaccination Austria 1967 80s  Newsflash anti vaxxers, COVID stopped Japan society follow rules cares health around them, willingly follow public health measures so, including masking vaxxing. definitely get J&amp;J

There extremely preliminary evidence pfizer might better moderna (vs moderna + moderna booster), falls way short clinical proof

Basically, get either MRNA booster. 

I'm away evidence mix containing J&amp;J better pure MRNA mix said quick math im Delta twice five times contagious virus circulated 2020. didn’t cause issues first time probably won’t now. you’re risk myocarditis due age get J&amp;J presuming you’re it’s age group boosters seem needed later go pick another. got mine last month... tell white lie got 100 ug moderna top JJ april....alittle fever chills worth it.  mean that. implies endemicity next step haven’t reached yet. getting rid informed consent, one pillars modern medicine, right bodily integrity?

Even though still take reasonable precautions wear mask stores vaccinated gives level reassurance I’m questioning every semi risky thing do. mostly living normally reasonable precautions strawman attack imaginary argument (the strawman) someone else never made attempt defeat main argument along it.

A strawman ask someone rhetorical hypothetical meant illustrate broader point, happening here.

Pretty massive difference, actually. true, think important people understand getting booster now, ASAP, still increase antibodies lot time Thanksgiving. may take people week reach peak antibodies, imagine couple days less go 2,500 u/mL. still time, go get booster now.

Anti vaxxers planned protests tomorrow. we're find out. exact situation. male 40s, concerned potential myocarditis. valid concern right holding booster. also got 2nd moderna shot 3/25. know: 


Pfizer data israel boosters myocarditis. Seems like low chance: 


There countries Europe limiting use Moderna due higher risk myocarditis: 


Overall, risk low real concern. people get it, able get resolved. serious condition every persons resolved. Additionally, tracking US symptoms terrible. many people forums saying, heart racing, etc. - fever? bad? cause damage? tested it. really know effects booster yet. know timing, dont know long lasts, etc. never gotten 2nd dose 3-4 weeks first begin with. Even main pfizer/moderna research studies showed 1 shot still increasing antibodies got first. yes rushed. Yes right ask questions concerned. 99% people forum doctors, epidemologists, etc.  


So yea, dont listen people facebook random internet forums like this. Read studies make decision. right holding off. probably get booster, pfizer even though moderna, xmas time traveling. i’m pro-vaccine, anti-vaxxers aren’t criminals. dumbasses. cant go jail stupid. That's fair, thank reply!  big question remains-how often need get three dose vaccine considered fully vaccinated? Looks like getting least three shots year. Also, heard epidemiologist studies pandemics mention thinks one going 25-40 year pandemic! HIV already 40 years. Fortunately HIV transmit easily. Firstly want point I'm vaccinated, got jab soon available age group always favour them, I'm sure agree imposing administrative sanctions refusing get vaccinated. 
And reasons based international bioethical reasons. European theater, Convention Human Rights Biomedicine.  
Article 5 Convention states that: intervention health field may carried person concerned given free informed consent it. 
The exception contained Article 8 treaty icluding exception stating that: emergency situation appropriate consent cannot obtained, medically necessary intervention may carried immediately benefit health individual concerned. 
The European Court Human Rights ruled times aspect allowing mandatory vaccination, proporcionated warns imposing kinds sanctions, ""Vavřička Others"" ruling states kinds measures counterproductive.   got third. get third too, can! admit vaccine isnt effective said was?

How effective say was/would be? Specifically?

Or chance one many millions comprehensive skills interpret even 6th grade math therefore started imagining things spreading misinformation immature scared little ass never learned deal fear properly?

As properly tell ive already decided answer be, that's ive met thousands like you, carbon copies eachother. distrusting authorities original, make smart case mostly comes immature And? realize strict nationwide mandates diseases like polio, mumps, measles, whooping cough make live life completely free worry you’ll ever deal life? Adding another vaccine prevent repeated outbreaks improve health outcomes millions people globally. grocery stores…. strangely enough.

Probably cause cashiers scream second enter.

Shopping carts used mandatory time limit number people store. didn’t coin went inside ask plastic chip got screamed 3 different people telling need cart (Had mask on). Yes find shocking. Obviously everyone get vaccinated making mandatory? sets one hell precedent future. formality 10 days, lockdown 20 days. It’s law 10 days lockdown need continued. literally gotten shots since baby. really cant see difference vaccine boosters infinite boosters forever? come ""vaccine addiction"" conspiracy theories still going quite complicated work law. local jurist comments (in German) Austrian here, yes put legally jail aren’t able pay fine, term „Ersatzfreihheitsstrafe“ means go prison daily value fine paid. happens tho refuse pay can’t pay! I'm skeptical anti-vaxxers trust health care system beforehand. Hard call targeted every country earth hit it.    funny feeling  Could PCR test result affected tonsilitis test done?

I've bad case tonsilitis since Saturday 13th November fever day two.

Did PCR test Wednesday 17th got positive result morning (Friday 19th) underlying condition? wait February? Sounds like may need another vaccine better efficacy variants. Maybe, idk, COVAXIN  main brothels offering free entrance anyone got vax lol. 

Lol. that's incentive!  True. scan code someone else get every restaurant. got proper checks concerts movie theatre. pretty useless without ID check. Good thing got vaccinated! I've seen translated way media. 20 days reevaluated stopped 10 days. guess essentially same. Sounds like effectively waning...    Imaging willingly bring society collapse facebook said   I've heard multiple people. symptoms all, second pfizer. bit concerned      I’d say that’s legitimate response forcing needle someone’s arm without consent.

There's many reasons that, list few:

- hospitals full (which austria) able get treatment broken leg example, would directly hurt nevermind vaccination status

- know vaccine reduces chance infection (especially early months vaccination), chance serious case therefor even transmission (even asymptomatic, vaccinated person less likely transmit virus)

- named last point yourself, there's really small amount people simply *can't* get vaxxinated whatever reason. people rely population vaccinated underlying medical conditions.  Hey all, give corticosteroid nasal spray (ex. Flonase generic one) try. lost taste/smell months, read gave try. Takes weeks daily use see permanent progress, seeing results days.

3. Sore arm saline solution maybe. Injecting pure water deadly believe.    as? Vaccine failing give 100% immunity. like seatbelt, 100% safe lowers risk. Vaccines never give 100% immunity every immune system reacts differently. Unvaccinated people still spread virus vaccinated people risk them. agree giving prison sentences unvaccinated, still choice totally acceptable treat hospitals they're beds give regulations risk others.  people affected. opinion, apathy malice got deserved. Unless miracle happen think wave ever brought back control 10 days. Sure, think shocked many people would opt mildest incentives. Especially debt, need support family like. know easy Germany, know 4 people done successfully. nonvaxxers, people 2 Chinese shots + 1 mrna booster 2 others wanted party days 14 days up. did.  actually figured COVID came yet? remember year ago two theories either someone ate bat accidentally leaked Wuhan disease research facility, sudden everyone stopped talking it?  love got downvoted. guess unvaccinated started feeling negative it. bodily integrity people get infected antivaxxers pandemic deniers? Screw them, nobody right spread pandemic name bodily integrity. make significant difference infection rate.

The virus mostly spread unvaccinated country, 60% positive tests unvaccinated people, despite much smaller group, much less likely take test ill. OP's title ""Austria **enforces**"".   Ah gotcha. That's bit shame actually. actually feels like conscious choice people make, deal consequences, not. yea people cold think that. Seeing idiots money make people angry.

Low vaccination rate many antivaxxers. 

Plus go pubs, stadiums full, concerts, festivals. Oh fifth season begun, carnival (Fasching). 
People carrying anymore. masks clubs pubs. Halloween parties. People stopped test themselves. 

In poor words everybody acted like pandemic over. I’m surprised we’re situation. still ducking hate it. Can’t wait get booster.  Bulgarian here. dare hope anymore. keep talking though real thing past allowed diseased people infect others freely.

But not, not, never been.

See longer comment curious, way immune compromised?

I'm wondering took third shot get desired immune reaction (and therefore caused symptoms 3rd jab)  2 shots Pfizer booster Moderna. fun, side effects wearing 2 days later, got MASSIVE cold, one worst I've ever had. thought actually COVID went got tested. figure sneaked hit hard immune system dealing booster shot.

It shitty week. First country attach brain spine. winter going rough leaving home would stop tracking you, tbh. dumb people here, truly sorry. older are, especially 60+, earlier need booster. Furthermore according studies AstraZeneca good compared BioNTech. Last least, depends heavily body, much antibodies creating. may silly reason oppose mandatory vaccinations, I'm starting worry loss control groups scientific research/study. everyone gets vaccinated, we're going lose baseline data compare vaccines against. 

Meanwhile, contrary expectation deadly pandemic shockingly willing (indeed, aggressively willing) subset people interested acting control group members taking vaccine. simply require participate studies? 2nd Pfizer shot due Sunday, 1st shot mild muscle pain arm injected in. 2nd shot severe side effects experience, same?  BRB moving Austria I'm sorry. :(

This fucking pissed AntiVa. Yeah, finally came clean whole situation week died.   Getting people work together impossible part

one day... hopefully soon. need care others

And that’s problem  teach virus start pandemic without official permit.    Boo hoo, chest pains.

Would rather seriously ill dead? chronically ill rest life? react chest pains vaccine, want see happen get COVID.

Adapt die. situation sit back grift.
Unless doctor specifically tells to, get booster. fine 6 months.

The information adapts. adapt it.    reigned parade… Seems slow start fast ramp might've boon Japan case. I'd theorize due bulk ramp vaccinated individuals + masks maybe kind acted sort herd immunity. know us got vaccinated office Tokyo pretty quickly vaccinations started ramping up.

This would probably explain huge drop case numbers moment vaccinations started ramping cases delta starting get big. lot individuals full vaccine efficacy short amount time + masks lowering droplets might helped curb virus replicating much slowly died out. Masks lowering droplets also may helped vaccines effective too, there's less amount virus ever caught it. received 6 tetanos shots life. Why?

Better safe sorry. smell cigarette smoke! Coke tastes... wrong. switched Dr P better, taste same. Lemon still tastes fine, crave lime.    Antivaxxers ask many vaccines received, count boosters finally delete Facebook. misrepresenting first study. Here's (one respected science magazines) say study:

*Face masks protect COVID-19. That’s conclusion gold-standard clinical trial Bangladesh, backs findings hundreds previous observational laboratory studies.* received 6 tetanos shots 30 years skateboarding, climbing rusty fences generally landing hospital frequently Evil Knievelling...

4 * H1N1 4 H3N2

2 * Hepatitis B plus booster 10 years later.

Another 20-30 vaccines including rabies. Get used it.        That's encouraging. Thanks reply. believe getting Janssen booster need see 2 specialists next week find information still heart pains / weird flutters / irregular beating sometimes feels like weight sitting chest Nope, knows many times protected point. Plus I'm pretty sure getting virus quickly vaccinated. CDC going open everyone? Would nice see countries adult-up same.  eligible booster Age 18+ work live high-risk Examples workers may get COVID-19 booster shots: [ 1 ]

  Education staff (e.g., teachers, support staff, daycare workers)
  Food agriculture workers
  Manufacturing workers
  Corrections workers
  U.S. Postal Service workers
  Public transit workers
  Grocery store workers

Since mentioned large groups eligible. people ones medical exemptions.


Nobody else. Honest Question:

**Do know anyone died Corona vaccinated?** 

&amp;#x200B;

I know many become sick afterwards, one died . friend knows people died vaccinated. seems vaccine lessens impact virus rather provide protection like traditional vaccine. Disney give two farts wannabe dictator says, suspect. received 6 shots tetanos 4 H1N1 4 H3N2 2 Hepatitis B.

That works. end. Good  less intense original shots were. I'd get pain relievers sports drinks. True, experts...  Fauci, fighting plagues life. anyone experience heart flutters second shot? so- get booster? 

I want to, heart flutters really spooked I’m holding Everyone needs booster 6 mo.  Well, considering original strain COVID19 effectively extinct, yes, would say everyone vaccinated start would probably dealing pandemic large one. Even California like that. SF EVERYBODY masked home situation. Stop highway between, mask seen. possible booster numbers increase? plausible required get 4th 5th booster more?   Yep, Pfizer way, booster too, effects all. Mild transitory mini-soreness arm, touched it, went away day two.  ...Why not? CVS Publix walk in. H1N1 H3N2 still around .... yeah. even ask me, qualify 2 preexisting conditions. told husband (no preexisting conditions) get one, ask either. lot places, gather, trying get many people possible protected.    So, even showed correct usage than/then willfully decided fuck up.    many people understand concept beyond me.       suggest boosters, unless you’re 65 immunocompromised, booster me.   people start saying ""why vaccinate vaccines work"", often received tetanos shot flu shot H3N2 H1N1?

Me: Tetanos 6 shots, H3N2 H1N1 4 shots.

So 3 COVID others received. COVID vaccines seasonal flu shot next years.  went close around 5 months smell taste started come back parosmia around two months things smelt tasted absolute worse. Needless say worst Yup. I'm cancer survivor former smoker (two CDC preconditions), went booster. even ask qualifying conditions. comments got impression health care workers general want see people vaccinated/boosted. told (no qualifying preconditions) husband go get one too, did. also quizzed preconditions. want us fortified possible going hellish (COVID-wise) holiday season.   state Saxony 62 cases per 100000 among vaccinated compared 1700 cases among unvaccinated

Same 1648 per 100k

vaxxed 109 per 100k   flair kinda cringe tbh   It’s still Delta variant wasn’t around last winter. looking alpha then.  Yeah, correct, wanted clarify further. Would rather covid? Nice, country balls make outright mandatory. expect big demonstrations response though.  Lying vaccinated order create uncertainty vaccines undecided anti-vax 101. isn’t study says that. Agreed. wanted correct OP's title ""Austria **enforces.**"" got second jab spent next day unending agony, apparently immune system interesting reaction. I'm skeptic vaccines I'd need lot stupid am, sure want third shot going repeat. Yeah, seem think next persons. EU USA seem think ourself first firstmost... would mask up, get vac-quota 80+% would much better...

But Switzerland bit 60%... symptoms original shots - awesome!! hope Germany don’t exact same

If alternative people dying/clogging hospitals... benefits outweigh problems. Switzerland get Dokument CR-Code. CR-Code scanned (and put App) valid ID. faking really easy task checked correctly. course buy original DB would possible, everything else near impossible fake.

How done place?   high latitudes pretty much everyone low Vitamin winter months. 

It's Ireland get around 7 hours daylight, cloudy. got tested years ago found extremely low

Even government recommend everyone takes  island also helps sounds like feeling get drink clear liquor dark liquor night, science probably similar.  Funny, know lots vaccinated unvaccinated people gotten covid. 

But guess group 8 deaths countless hospitalizations vs 0 deaths 0 hospitalizations?  know anti-vaxxers never lie... Surprised many people support this, seriously messed ! giving Covid 19 antiviral pills? giving 19 pills humans? Yes, according press conference, majority parliament easily reached, 3 large parties agree subject. Vaccinated 22 weeks pregnant covid. Congestion fever chills aches vomiting. I’m extremely nervous, hoping vaccinated keep getting sick. feel terrible though really put ""health"" healthcare. 🙄 Japan comparison here. Also heading winter nation masking culture even Covid.

Their charts look like success story show masks vaccinations way. Even winter winning. Bruh work team ten people. fucking read? got bonuses getting shot friends know who’s vaccinated who’s not… people (4) including got vaccine Covid leave 2 weeks month. single person didn’t get vaccinated went Covid leave….. think I’m gonna notice talks day vaccine bad tells didn’t get haven’t gotten sick? think didn’t notice friend Myers Aaron Mark got shot got Covid? go talk managers it’s experience? mean dude also live complex 6 people live we’re close. I’m one got Covid……. unvaccinated don’t wear masks. keep seeing ain’t making up. believe science vaccine one getting sick vaccine 5 neighbors (40-70) fine makes think man. motivation would share experience got fucking vaccine… makes feel lot better getting second dose 6 half weeks first lazy. ahead look definition January vs April vs today This!! Wtf taking long approve booster rest us? They're initiating legislation required vaccination - knows happen end. First worse second me. Third first. Everyone's different though. Why? already tightened restrictions, seems like vaccination rates increasing. Also liberals (FDP) next government chance happens 0,1%.  believe Tucker Carlsen still air. thought Jon Stewart solved crap effectively shut Crossfire 2004 countries necessary first place! live vienna number schwurbler (anti vaxx covid deniers) roof  hope exact thing.

You’re upset boosters deemed effective enough authorize, things evolving, revised recommendation?   seems like shamefully high number. advocating vaccine around still 2nd shot woke suddenly 4AM electric chock heart booming chest, felt really uncomfortable days after, pain though still felt strange, concerning. went away hear 3rd shot, unfortunately  Says you.

Every local news article TV report I've come across said getting vaccinated significantly reduce chance catching infection developing severe symptoms.

Even politicians agreement this.

There's nothing credible newsworthy I've come across says getting vaccine 100% effective barrier COVID-19. know people started getting idea. deep fantasies misremember doctors telling them?      Damn people can't even get booster.. I've second shot 4 months ago. Guess they're pretty much useless point  Thank much clarifying. That’s terrifying. I’m sorry go thank sharing. Hopefully that’s least brush Covid have. Sure do. combo feeling 100% fine 48 hours. Get boosted tomorrow. responding to? insinuating new... exact opposite actually... entire point, point others (if actually read thread chain comments). 

We're marketed certain data absolute fact, proof 1/2 shot vaccine ""save us""... even though data withheld, manipulated, history virus like flu show can't stopped vaccine. 

1 shot, 2 shots, 3 shots, 4... get em get forced door... job, house, grocery store, etc. 

Needle pecker. Hey! Potentially 😊  Actually beginning said. beginning “vaccine” widely stated way would eradicate virus. 

Only huge. Umber breakthrough cases occurred start current narrative. everyone gotten vaccinated instead playing politics, COVID would nearly died vaccinations started wear off.  Vaccine 93% effective hospitalizations. tested particular combination, educated guess.

You'd probably get slightly better immunity, difference taking booster worth extra trouble. 

If take extreme ... get booster every week? every day?  Extremely low. affecting young kids (besides outliers course). Agreed. 5 we’ll getting soon it’s available age bracket. 1-2 weeks range. would assume 2 weeks safe probably lot protection 1 week. particular vaccine uses mRNA tech different vaccines referring to. enables fast delivery production antibodies needed combat decease. expect requirement previous older vaccines. Remember technology always improving goal always improve. Truth is, **everyone going get infected**, unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, vaccinated, boosted, super boosted, super super boosted etc.

It inevitable, nothing it. Asking questions isn’t anything wrong. don’t get everyone goes apeshit crazy people start questioning things concerning this. Like aren’t concessions made people natural immunity?  way. would paid real cash money see live. Mainly every vaccine prevents getting sick. 

I think calling vaccine misnomer prophylactic treatment. 

As soon “pills” Covid approved bet see recommendation getting jab go back burner. Problem peoples first signs COVID loss smell taste, damage already done there. feel damage control dying hospitalization. read antibodies convalescent patients. wonder AstraZeneca produce large scale volumes they’re already doing. It’s funny say make quick run dollar general house flat astonished many people without masks (without anything, face shield, covering, nothing) and/or gloves clearly sick something. 

Like, literally hear people coughing, sniffling, clearing throats, wiping noses, sort shit indicates they’re obviously sick sort something. 

Nearly 10 people walked passed (as far away could) wiping snot chapped, Rudolph-nose sniffling couldn’t care less mask gloves anything. 

I seriously wanted say shit 3rd person clearly runny nose shit, like, “Sounds like might cold shit. better hope that’s common cold full-blown covid, you’re good time. even fully vaccinated people still get it, spread get really sick it.” 

It blew mind seeing people, especially time year, ***especially*** we’re covid pandemic, clearly sick shit something, totally carefree, wandering around dollar store bunch people sick shit. 

I’ve really grown loathe fuck lot people population last 1.5-2 years used to.  don’t know many doctors, you? places checked pretty strict 6 month requirement   Wow, that’s effective vaccine!    still get booster JJ, Covid got Guys. Maybe Dude still around?  know people see guy.   Thus, free measure. I’m tired hearing it’s free, it’s not.

“There free lunch.”

ETA: appropriate phrasing “no pocket cost”. Check one out. Seems way too, Covid nasty mofo. Seems wise take many precautions one reasonably avoid getting giving it. wonder pills working help stave Long Covid, internal damage.  wanna go live grid forget this.  think you’re calling people think dumb, dumb. upvote  good news United States allowed mix match. Data Singapore also given federal government Health Human Services Centers Disease Control example Moderna booster works Pfizer Biontech originally vaccinated pre-pandemic, remote work seriously difficult companies start remote first, takes lot infrastructure make work. one people working home get left actually detrimental, processes happen office.

the really amazing thing pandemic forced companies add remote support everyone suddenly remote worker. real silver lining remote work real business advantages company gifted opportunity transform place leverage that.

even though apple this, reckon lots companies realize gift forge ahead.    Meaning 1 million people infected covid obvious sign neural damage.

Let’s open everything masks vaccine passports though! Really depends state mandates. California already requiring vaccines college students 13yo+. Probs k-12 January August 2022 latest. Take away people’s free babysitting let see exactly expensive private schooling it’ll damn near 100% child’s elementary school mandatory fully vaxxed five returning January. already received first dose. It’s sucks bad reaction. say what’s alternative. I’ve seen people know (unvaccinated) suffer weeks ventilators die messaging nightmare.  boosters vaccinating kids. people would listen, manage. hope northeast. Hope California, least vaccinated parts, rest don’t know.


The south go back another outbreak like last winter. pre-delta see next one goes. may immunity summer horror had, immunity may waning still lot unvaccinated people taking precautions. know need booster? said need go back 2 minutes later wash again. 2 minutes later… I'm going quote someone else thread make feel bit Don’t numbers clearly show it’s still pandemic Colorado currently one worst outbreaks country. Take look Current hospitalizations per 100k unvaccinated: Current hospitalizations per 100k vaccinated: Fauci says there’s uptick vaccinated hospitalizations, he’s right—compared exceptionally well initially compared unvaccinated they’re still fraction number hospitalizations. It’s even close.   dude. That’s literally statistics work. use sample sizes extrapolate across larger population sizes. can’t say hospitalization rate per given sample size sure increase hypothetical you’re making. You’ll figure mistake later gonna go back forth anymore. No. think clear. even many inches, many feet. Zero. Yeah I’m wondering there’s end sight. 30% adults unvaccinated. Nothing going change minds vast majority people, meaning pandemic drag on. 

Case numbers longer show whole picture, vaccinated people get COVID far less likely end hospital.

What doctors saying virus *might* become endemic 2022. suggesting keep celebrating holidays 2023 possibly even later, even everyone family vaccinated?  true. Look data believe Israel - one highest vaccination rates world subject waves cases. It’s simply fact vaccinations shelf life terms protection don’t protect longer 5ish months countries southern europe. Germany middle north. Thanks, informative.  flip side statement: imagine driving 100mph oncoming cat

That's one big cat worried seatbelt. we're done masks Central Florida.

You Jax you? Masks came opened restaurants full capacity. gotta get cough checked, maybe take test you’re it. sounds pretty bad it’s climate cough  Data suggests mutation rates higher unvaccinated vaccinated. Also copies COVID there, opportunities mutate, reducing spread vaccination reduces chances negative mutations occurring gaining foothold. dude… assure confused think are. take 100k unvaccinated say 44 people 100k hospitalized, doesn’t matter many infected sample size. 

Yes…it absolutely does. zero Covid state stat say zero hospitalized per 100k unvaccinated population. Using math, could extrapolate everyone state Covid would hospitalizations. 

This stat constant happens regardless caseload. It’s snapshot current hospitalizations, *product* current caseload. cases continue rise, hospitalizations per population also rise, higher proportion population Covid, [literally see original link. gonna keep going back forth you’ll figure mistake eventually. 

The stat looking hospitalizations per Covid-19 case.   Touche  keep saying getting two vaccine shots company  Compared Canada half population 7ish times number new cases.. hardly tell still thing honestly, nobody cares anymore. Sore arms. went 3 mile hike next day zero problems! kiddos 8 10. dead Feeling like shit sign body creating immune response foreign antigen. That’s good thing unfortunately. body learning deal bullshit  Neither us prove either right course.
Doesn't make sense though.

We know Moderna's immunity lasted longer Pfizer likely higher dosage, triggered antibody response. boosters *less* dosage though. 

I can't prove course, I'm seeing reasoning booster would put antibodies higher levels even original shots.

You say ""every reason"" might help elaborate least one. due respect, would mutations blamed antivaxxers? mean, one point vaccines allow strains better suited avoiding vaccine (ie delta) flourish? We’re still getting it, it’s vaccine really good preventing hospitalization death. Like miraculously good.  correct. word ENDEMIC. visitors must show negative Covid-19 test result past 48 hours, flights city cancelled numbers China remain lower countries, eight domestic infections recorded Tuesday.  Winter coming people inside. Expect US soon.  Ha! noticed pointed out. 

Maybe people think I'm sarcastic something? Either people can't stand thought continue careful: thought would vaccines came out.

China constant testing travellers. someone test positive China, 99.9% symptoms infectious. 

Most outbreaks China due people infected many days ago even showing symptoms(working around airport/border), fake itineraries avoid quarantine &amp; test. also sometimes charged would overwhelmed hospitals.

You know, reason people give shit COVID. think probably earlier according findings. almost seems like whole ""you buy masks"" BS knew supplies low. booster recommended healthy people, recommended healthy people ""high-risk settings""? immunity go healthy people?

The conclusion obvious, can't rely government honest competent.  understand culture.

Tumours proliferate expense rest organism. main Supercenter smaller Marketplace one, hardly go smaller one. say it’s pretty much regular, Supercenter one: would say least 50%-60% people see don’t wear masks and/or gloves. It’s getting point pretty much *only* people see wearing masks constantly, enough even work, employees. 

As far customers wearing masks, it’s getting less less people days go by. point less 2 months ago FDA VRBPAC refused recommend boosters adults even really want approve anyone 65 (they reword questions vote multiple times). this.

Yeah, goverment's couple months behind logical thinking ever since began.

They told initially use masks, example. roast orange stove? Might try desperation lol take extra miles understand simple thing? Yeah, there's number things could chairs. fact they're using sitting expected many America nowadays.

&amp;nbsp;

^^^/s    Humans eradicated one virus history. Covid forever also surprise people developing vaccine said developing it. regret vaxxing? many people say flu, mean bad cold.

I flu absolute fucking torture. boiling hot freezing cold once, going buckets Kleenex, felt like bones covered little fractures going burst skin, worst headache life mile, fatigued even stand minute took microwave soup—and things enough energy go bathroom kitchen. dazed even call sick work couple days. same. day bad entire skeleton hurting really weird  can’t fathom working longer week. Agree disagree. point 1, though, *I know. lived past two years everyone else. replying not-real hypothetical.*  Nah, Western propaganda. stupid enough always fall it. thing too. 

We'll lucky get next decades without bioterror incident kills millions.    headline say anything ""going away""? even use word ""endemic"", literally *the opposite* ""going away"". covid late august (was double vax Ed before). get booster? combo, booster kicked butt day. kicked bad though. chills something else man. regrets, still way better covid seen/heard. eyes going skull couldnt sleep fever. nose completely blocked, even big Afrin dosage. right lung destroyed. Hard af short too. flu even diarrhea past. 3 month cough. IMO destructive, worst Ive ever had. like violent street assault got hit hard. That’s great, put getting booster October ended getting sick. Glad you’re going put like everyone day off. do, yes  Valid point It’s dollar general, wouldn’t expect much there. least reference one near me. Walmart near half people wearing masks though. getting breakthrough case covid, long wait get booster? you, itll ~~interesting~~ terrifying see info comes out

FIFY. I've also saying long time incredibly easy fake vaccine card general. There's nothing make harder duplicate copy like emboss foil specific paper stock. get is, anyway, agreeing others verifying database sure way. scheduled appointment booster say anything eligibility, 20's ask anything risk level. Vaccines. Don’t. Hurt. People.

They never hurt people. never hurt people.

The ‘next months’ waiting deadliest time year Covid. Throw holidays, putting child, rest family risk, child contracts spreads holidays.

Please get vaccinated now. It'll probably kind like flu whooping cough. Kid gets bunch shots child, maybe couple road. Maybe yearly thing. Hopefully immunity goes shots, virus starts slow understand why, getting toward two years on, keep talking supplying antivirals high-risk patients only, seeking authorization high-risk patients. supply chain allow manufacturing all? Life still severely disrupted, long Covid seem discriminate much comes classically high/low risk patients.

There might something understand layman, need medicine available *everyone* Covid. symptoms disease abating much time. I'm seeing fully vaccinated people know sick weeks, presumably certain percentage developing long-term damage.

Seems like way third dose like Israel antivirals all. Like yesterday. good, let's fire 60%, TSA useless anyways Bro. 

I applaud trying here, English quite strong enough make case. use “TIME” strange. Chinese word you’re looking time standing for?

I give many reasons Trump won, none “mistake.” 

And again, plenty democracies able successfully combat COVID without needing resort draconian measures. US’s failures aren’t failure liberal democracy per se. 1. could still go grocery shopping
2. Online ordering exists. could (relatively) small group people working grocery supply chain another group people deliveries. goes industries operate fashion.

Essential retail businesses could stayed open allowed designated delivery people come in. They'd pick bundles food, put together employee, ordered internet someone still home.

Does work places without systems? No. guess does? Government assistance. government temporarily nationalize essential services handle determining gets food. 10 people house? need 10 people worth food. One person house cat? Get one person worth food cat food.

No, perfect. Yeah, would clusterfuck. still would better able go two years.   mostly unvaccinated. keep distance. live Florida know governor front man Mouse.   know it’s CCP CPC (in English). Chinese Communist Party. 

I wasn’t making comparison communist regimes, though, prior Chinese dynasties: Qing, Ming, Yuan, etc. 

But know plenty CCP compared CPV CPSU. Interesting assumption part here, given made statements CCP falls within framework communist parties regimes autocratic (it clearly is.)

Interestingly, you’re going make inheritance history argument, could make case US inheriting Enlightenment British political theory well. all, US political theory stems Locke, Rousseau Burke. doubt contemporary China many underpinnings Kongzi Han Fei Shang Yang (not mention Li Si), arguably transition end Qing Xinhai later Mao beyond interestingly frayed threads. Mao continuation also strong break past— Mao broke lot past philosophy writings, legalism excepted. 

What’s thought Mao interpreted Li Si/Han Fei? work nursing home Pennsylvania staff 41% vaccinated. Deadline Dec 4 first shot. get 30 day unpaid leave. still vaccinated, resign position. Gonna interesting.  understand Trump became president. thought ""little mistake"" democracy

But wanna tell damage TIME US regime. already great job US regime work 200years meeting critical damage. believe US people ten years later much understanding abrasion TIME

Back COVID, communist sth let China united. common memories though thousand years countless disasters remind Chinese people, time sacrifice individuals' freedom unite together powerful disaster. Covid back September. Word advice looking something eat keep strength up. **Do eat peanut butter can't taste anything**. one worst feelings able get bland protein paste *I forgot can't salivate* mouth. Mayor DC stopped mask requirement so, goes neighborhood! Source? Oxford vaccine tested 8 12wks strange others short 2nd dose intervals. Data Israel (which uses Pfizer) indicates myocarditis risk lower booster 2nd doses. theories (doses apart, etc) really don’t know enough yet say certainty. 

What seem know though risk low regardless. good aware especially male 30. take concerted international cooperation it. 

We've learned something like never happen. standardized card, digitized right? I’m CO still paper card… missing important step? Thanks! micromanager office recently got promoted team leads sent email today saying department expected work towards always office next several months. 

Company wide policy hybrid schedule, nope department. 

I warned team lead today bad idea expect kick back. employee market tech company. Plenty open job opportunities full remote opportunities there.  back claim sources? read infectious disease experts said something like ""a vaccine way would eradicate virus""?

I ask bc journal *Nature* interviewed 100 immunologists back January shots rolling out: beautiful dream scientists think it’s improbable. January, Nature asked 100 immunologists, infectious-disease researchers virologists working coronavirus whether could eradicated. Almost 90% respondents think coronavirus become endemic — meaning continue circulate pockets global population years come (see 'Endemic future').

This indicates *opposite* claim, really would like know listening vaccine info. scientists familiar subject, talking heads news? We're completely fucked  made decide move away area. Don’t hate them, damn people. 

Hopefully get back soon! checked Brownsville 52% 2 shots. Nice (for Texas). community school right 11 13 faculty Covid cases fully vaccinated teachers, even boosted past two months. credit vaccines us deal sniffly teachers rather dead ones.   Give every booster. could use 5g new phone think antivaxxers going take drug instead? assume it’s “Big Pharma” refuse too. MAb would manufactured cell line. yeah fair enough, made mistake thinking NA = US. Seems articles unvaxxed southern states never stopped rolling in.       headed right us! anyone wondering (I was)…

Their population 85 milllion.

They 68% fully vaccinated.  old you? got Moderna 2nd dose absolutely destroyed 2 days. I'm super nervous get booster (it's 7 months since 2nd dose). want feel sick :( nearly 2000 people Austrian hospitals COVID right lie? Well, way. would month long superspreader event, relieved got canceled. worry, flat earthers dont believe Australia exists easily 90% anti vaxxers issue this. thought pfzier claims 95% booster?   evidence such, currently FDA recommending getting booster vaccine received previously. I’m imagining helicopters tranq darts opposite? two modernas, better get pfizer booster? Presumably would moving scale need continued boosters? Unvaccinated Austrian here. ✋

Good know thank reassuring information! found mandatory vaccination today actually getting really scared punishment refusing get vaccinated could end even severe. 

Are sure going prison getting vaccinated isn’t going show criminal record still something that’s left decided? 
I criminal record I’d like stay way obviously.

I’ve read fine getting vaccinated high 25.000€ I’m mistaken? 

So think I’m likelihood going jail couple days (or maybe weeks necessary).

Do think going one time penalty time jail I’m good go allowed walk freely?

I’m anti-vaxxer way. 
It’s mothers friend died shortly vaccine cerebral vein thrombosis can’t overcome fear vaccines. I’d get vaccinated I’d live irrational crippling anxiety would take away quality life. something obviously needs done pandemic current situation. Saturday decided say fuck scheduled booster shot even tho didnt ""technically"" qualify. 

Today see boosters approved checked pharmacy websites everything booked well next week, places dont spots till December.

I'm honestly wondering rarely heard anyone complaining already existing mandatory vaccines, vaccine disease currently causing pandemic see many people arguing body autonomy.  need get booster within 7 months.

Doesn't bother me. get shot every half year keep wife, myself, safe(er), that's I'll doing. everyone doing. Lmao they're literally government million options. Garnish wages, let leave country, take away drivers licenses. Granted point that's pretty severe general idea jail, still, plenty options that. that's plain dumb.

Probably mask requirement Ken Ham's Creation Science museum. Appreciate response. Yea scheduled booster sentiments thoughts. Unfortunately anti-vax friend constantly sending posts IG algorithm filled type content. side note, sure people downvoting me. asked genuine question position uncertainty. people hating understanding acknowledging doubts trying seek advice making right decision? saying comparison lockdown mandated vaccination iron.

I saying argument jail argument lockdown ironic. It’s across street it’s miles miles away. Also reason lab first place SARS wildlife near Wuhan known carry different SARS-like viruses. Unfortunately fear going get worse. Winter set-in Russia, people spending time indoors little ventilation.

As infamous Soviet leader said ""One death tragedy; million statistic"". emergency. Humans attack. Governments world throughout history responded emergencies measures differ peacetime. would perfect. produce proof. Thanks, statistical numbers specific meanings risk myocarditis (which incredibly tiny risk) likely occurred second dose booster. booster also half dosage Moderna. going thread everyone thinks africa lives mud huts savanna small tribes make bunch guesses based idea. Even though 78% africans live urban areas. always implied go prison pay fine. Otherwise reason pay fine.   Novel respiratory coronavirus overtook Wuhan, China. I'm sure come Wuhan Novel Respiratory Coronavirus Lab across street.  buying purchase agreement. different- two different ""science"" demoninations one modern thinking, yes.  dont think understand meaning irony.

Lockdown doesnt take away right put want bodies basis modern medicine. Yeah, number 1 Chickenpox contagious infection, thats call Windpocken germany, travelling across huge distances wind mean someone doesn’t like taste healthy food, loves taste unhealthy food, probably guess. Hm ok thanks sharing! get moderna? vaccine booster? heard people mixing matching them.  think happens dont pay fine? Welp. good friend supposed leave Austria Tuesday. feel bad wasn’t created lab. scientist published paper it’s news.

The Chinese government blame containing coronavirus early. debate. It’s Austria… still Christmas markets UK, honest bit tourist trap. Vaccine mandates nothing new. Lots children. maybe 20-25% get vaxx city 11 million, half early cases tied area size football field meat market.  I've seen interview professor focuses constitutional law said done correctly, vaccine mandate accordance constitution, would guess chances high. basically comes necessary proportional means combating pandemic iirc. Someone outdo gender reveal party caused forest fire. vaccine rewrite cells. mRNA vaccines least don't. merely introduce mRNA sequence tells ribosomes synthesize spike protein immune system reacts develops antibodies. Rewriting cell would mean alter DNA. exactly virus does. Like mentioned. utterly hilarious much screeching due mRNA aLtER DNA virtually impossible piece mRNA even attempt whilst virus actually exactly idiots afraid of. Yet make conscious decision anti vaccine pro virus. irony completely lost braindead monkeys. didn’t want wait got full moderna dose. regrets. pretty tangential, work company involves quite lot travel. first month, sent local vaccine clinic get jabbed half dozen different nasties. fine. Neither company batted eyelid it.

With covid vaccination, they're absolutely treading eggshells it. vaccination status considered highly confidential, boss keeps emphasising personal medical choice jazz, can't forced get want to.

It's fascinating differently people treating covid jab compared everything else, probably important vaccine get moment. mention infuriating large sectors population avoiding it. Interesting. third dose worst one three (all Pfizer) side effects - second dose, symptoms lasted 24 hours. Worth added protection, though! 1-3 years child entitled paid parental leave (Karenz). order keep getting must fulfill timely pages called mother-child pass, checkups vaccinations, yes, already economic penalties people follow adviced path kids. 1% wear pro vaccine pro lockdown, said tiny bit ironic lockdown

I know literally same. study repeat infections, vaccinated unvaccinated, whether second infection likely severe. Example: unvaccinated person gets mildly moderately sick, test positive year, data whether virus affects differently?

There lot ifs soon see data reinfection? third Moderna hit harder second, saying something second kicked ass. putting people lockdown cut it? That's happening Austria, lockdown unvaccinated enough. lockdown all, lockdown unconstitutional controversional, since vaccine mandate less harsh lockdown all, even vaccinated. Well smallpox - would still same. vaccines work, smallpox eradicated, need anymore. huge part Austrian population (like yo) get smallpox vaccine scars.

But yes, currently ""first"" far know Austria first announce it. European ""neighbours"" follow assume.  deteriorating situation, Chancellor Angela Merkel regional leaders agreed Thursday restrict access restaurants, bars public events unvaccinated people hard-hit areas — country point. 

We can- people do- argue whole shutdown health people's sake vs keep country open economy's sake- country robust health care, clearly Germany poster country happen relax mandates. Back June relaxed mask mandates left people unguarded state mind municipalities easy way turn clock back. considering getting Moderna shot scheduling appointment Walgreens app stated FDA recommends getting shot received previously. (I received Pfizer originally)

Now I’m thinking Walgreens hasn’t updated procedures since FDA CDC clearly saying mixing might even  already 65% vaccinated Germany 68% vaccinated… proving getting much higher vaccination rate important. country universal healthcare, brings many implications though.  No, German speakers are. They'd rather drink tea use crystals take vaccine. Reddit what? Why?! great mission! would want kill it?! vast majority hospitalizations unvaccinated. 

People going get vaccine free will, they've months it. hospital.

Your plan fill hospitals hope people get shots waste money time everyone done right thing. countries scientifically literate populations. [Health Canada Information Pfizer admitting unvaxxed patients hospital capacity dire? Government numbers, 1254 new deaths.

&amp;#x200B;

Excess deaths 900k. [The Economist - Excess death article say anything jail Alright, sounds like first Austria well then.

 vaccine must take face punishment, taking ones would limit life options regards jobs, travel, etc.. That's nifty tool visualizing spread there. Nice allows tinker parameters.

Also holy hell measles absolute monster. Various doctors/medical professors prestigious medical universities saying thing based data.  offer subscription. I'm huge fan mandates. However, hospitals nearing capacity, think allowed refuse treat anyone vaccinated ensure enough bed capacity vaccinated patients. also think unvaccinated pay costs treatment admitted hospital (or higher insurance costs).   Yeah, like loads countries 90% adults vaccinated completely willingly. time. Germany aswell shit comes end.. every morning listening somebody complaining stressful  know Ireland this. 93% adults vaccinated, yet still anti-vaxxers causing half ICU admissions. lot even Irish too, would little political risk. Feels like you’ve reading lot anti vax comments, decision yours. You’ve given 2 doses mrna vaccine already it’s like haven’t done before. booster Moderna half dose provide boost antibodies combat waning immunity. risk myocarditis low, typically resolves itself. Again, decision stuff like “this new” “long term side effects” it’s year since folks trials got shots vaccines leave body quickly valid reasons. highly recommend check claims actual data unfollow types accounts. engage social media pull rabbit hole. Good luck! Legalities get slowly taken away. countries using Covid way America used 9/11 create Patriot Act basing ""right call"" judgment on? expertise evaluating evidence scientists FDA? know good reason taking time thorough review? link recommendation? I’m trouble finding Considering what's going Austria, wanted ask vaccination numbers considered low.

I live Israel similar vaccination percentages. OP FWIW pharmacist told expect side effects 2nd dose time held (I Pfizer) I'm going give benefit overwhelming doubt assume functioning brain. Here's advice: Try use it.

""you initially admitted vaccine 90% effective. means virus can, already spread among vaccinated. fact, greater chance mutate adjust harsher environment body vaccine. vaccinated likely create ""super virus""."" really put without slightest idea even remotely true. Respect   mandatory vaccinations? round people first? 26. Yeah second shot destroyed day. worst chills I’ve ever had. 

The booster ok! Last night little bit uncomfiness/chills relieved ibuprofen much better.  Damn! Hope fully recovered understand culture. 
What freedom gained fear sacrifice small step protect us all?
Do care people longer? Nothing stopping you. one question you. Go get It’s effective efficacy wanes time. practical reason probably lie get full Moderna dose booster, since half-dose FDA authorized.

My guess authorized half-dose lessen side effects reduce risk myocarditis. at-risk demographic myocarditis cool lying pharmacy staff (and getting vax card stamped), go it. progress symptoms prior admittance hospital? immune compromised?  need start accepting might persistent threat long time.

It's probably going dominate lives next 10 years. logistics vaccinating whole world significant number people refuse means going go away quickly. sympathies.

""Send back. taste smells like motor oil."" doesn’t. one spreading misinformation 100% still possible spread vaccine vaccinated. Stop bullshit lies.   Antibodies aren’t thing. J&amp;J seems fairly stable non waning immunity according lot studies seems produce better B cell response. issue less effective outset. fairly large real world data set released weeks ago show it’s 74.6% effective real world, that’s less mRNA vaccines, it’s likely you’ll symptomatic infection. encourage booster shot. J&amp;J’s numbers seemed show two doses 94.6% cross booster suggest using moderna top even higher.

I don’t think there’s real Sinovac/J&amp;J mixing study. I’d imagine like 3 dose Sinovac course probably effective.

As far J&amp;J, depends age likely. 2 effective, they’re certainly unprotected, it’s could protected. longer wait give second dose benefit it. 

But shorter time get benefit it. we're giving second doses 1 month first, almost everywhere still. we're giving second doses 40-year olds give first doses 15-year olds, almost everywhere. 

In places, lack safety efficacy data 15 year olds time 40+ year olds got vaccines. Delta pandemic magically end give third doses 60-year olds.

But lot prevent unnecessary hospitalizations deaths. requires 20-year olds 6+ months first dose. Starting timer ASAP exceeds value dose, regardless recipients' ages.

Not sure saying here. need 6 months first dose? made realize already exist, there's little chance could pass seat belt laws day age, sad guess haven’t talked boosters we’ve got second jabs lol. 

Good luck! I’m looking forward going again, months! Oh no. have. contact many fights ""When got accidents, big injury seatbelt."" would refuse drive anywhere buckled up, pulled times decided unbuckle. WTF taking long authorize boosters hurry tf need I’m sure you’re getting downvotes, really hope they’re working vaccines last longer.  Shoulda reversed polarity Pfizer already, wondering get full Moderna dose (including 2nd dose) instead booster? (Or vice versa). 

Because studies show that's apparently necessary. Vaccines, immune system general, strange unintuitive. necessarily mean better, may mean wasting vaccine. think intuition want present immune system enough threat notices make immune system notice more, means immune system wasting effort fighting fake Related: boosters “updated” version that’s effective newest variants? 

No, third shot identical first two (with exception Moderna lower dose). Studies Pfizer Moderna concluded modifying vaccines target variants directly actually result better protection (i.e. variants far similar enough original virus less look immune system).    far. NC mean, what's worst thing that'd happen: useless security theater TSA agents around grope steal baggage? Sounds pretty okay me. It’s definitely bad terms things humanity suffered through, sucks. It’s getting cold am, don’t qualify booster. haven’t gone date seen movie theater almost two years, I’m losing ability enjoy meal due low temperatures.  Vaccination produce antibodies cellular immunity (T-cells)

Antibodies stop virus tracks, cellular immunity takes time (a days) ramp infection.

Antibodies wane, reduces protection infection, cellular immunity sticks around provides protection serious disease, likely rest life.  Even antibodies gone still better place vaccinated. smoked casually less year college still get checked “former smoker” every time go doctor.   Oh I’m jealous. started picking t-mobiles shitty network. Well think hurt confidence billed thing going stop getting covid. rhetoric changed reducing severe symptoms hospitalizations. drug companies never said would reduce transmission. like changed definition vaccine accomodate innoculatiohn properties true vacine.

I personally like US Navy (?) calculates BMI. measure width elbow use combined weight calculate BMI. calculations I've seen take body fat % account. privileged assume everyone miss work

I made assumption. 
I'm aware lots Americans struggled even get first doses none sick leave expected side effects. Kind lose-lose actually.

It sucks, I'm pretty pissed sick leave gotte taken Build Back Better there's serious downside boosters.

I explained downside *prioritizing* boosters developed countries first.

We know fact vaccines 100% stop spread. Limiting great means Covid-19 stay. Yeah, definitely get everyone needed number doses prepare inevitable date Covid-19.             
Sure sucks people date, yet probably will, without opportunity get vaccine even developed. think expecting result Israel soon; supposed leak claiming **at least** 9-10 months protection, go detail meant included data. Probably similar parent age group, 30-39ish   Depends are, eligible first dose months ago. booster months sadly I’m tired mask, mask shit. 
At beginning pandemic, told us mask protect others. world manufacture enough face masks, told us masks also protect ourselves. vaccines came, told us don’t need wear mask vaccinated. changed said even vaccinated need wear masks delta variants. personally, stick wearing masks public works ways, protect others. Also it’s getting cold outside, I’d like keep face warm. People today seem remember anything. Someone stated earlier something effect ""we originally told vaccine 90% effective bunch people vaccinated; lots people forced get vaccinated. found effectiveness waned...and antibodies stick around long expected. think need better vaccine"". 

That comment got 30 upvotes....this one 30. going people? Lol can't u admit ppl rushing conclusions?? Hopefully, apple fell far tree       One hope reduce intensity time. least delta variant.

Shut bad Netherlands right want cry hide room till spring again.  long booster protection levels high again? One week? two weeks? Can't find much data it. difference nobody gives fuck don’t get flu shot almost certainly effective gotten June 10th.  

The downside lower immunity last 5 months would shots.

A number countries (including Canada UK) using larger intervals (2 4 months) good results.  understand. going talking doctor went ahead it. welcoming new member December want everyone protected. made sense us wait.  data? travel future see 3 -6 months widespread booster implementation?

I'm guessing based immune system function. antibodies wane eventually shots, would different? would stick around longer?  brother died accident wearing seatbelt.

Please, tell mom dumb. show cdph letter pharmacist shop, whatever takes get booster. one I've talked resistance, least California, get resistance able go different place less touch pharmacist That’s three year old. close friends kids age eagerly waiting approval too. wife finally able get booster next week friends scheduled, daughter get vaccinated, won’t stop stressing going daycare everyday. two months there, already brought cold home, stomach bug, somehow got hand, foot, mouth disease kid picking daughter up. ready lessen chances one thing. course it’s them. It’ll never COVID.  Well that's frightening. Pretty amazing 25mph collision stationary immovable object like 50% chance injury per article can't find remember name  depends pharmacist apparently. husband higher risk workplace obese BMI pharmacist initially going turn profession isn’t one categories approved right now. Eventually nobody waiting pharmacist said “fine” Cool thanks   Personally, it’s nice know percentage people I’m serving food can’t taste smell. 

Kind effect daily fucking life, even doesn’t matter you.  Man covid scare work. go get tested two days ago checking email signing see results absolutely terrifying. Luckily tested negative I’m motivated get booster. fair, uncertainty really tiring position constantly COVID put world clear sustained period uncertainty last two years.   agree. Long-term debility much frightening death. 

Of course, chronic problems like diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, asthma, depression, I'm overweight, ""normal"" probably healthier many Americans experience.  hear ya. Definitely wish information clearer times too. got second jab back April getting third(booster) next week.  Yes family. husband, kids double vaxxed. literally locked house year. daughter hospital serious health condition months wouldn’t allow anyone home. Now, fully recovered. thought supposed long. stopped wearing face masks months ago. sick, yes. we’ve covid tests negative. We’ve even exposed never got symptoms. can’t spend another winter stuck house. STILL work home. get point. it. don’t want get vaccinated, that’s problem. title CNN lil bit click bait.

&amp;#x200B;

The 3 pilots fired 'caught COVID-19 Germany' ""a serious breach""of Covid-19 procedures ""overseas layovers."" Ha - wish. asked cousin, she’s working getting RN. 8.55/h bumped 12/h one even applied last three months. flip side statement: imagine driving 100mph oncoming cat seatbelt thinking totally safe. That's kind happened reopening policy ""I totally back normal now"" crowd.

I've telling friends want bigger Friendsgiving gathering everyone coming get negative test. Yeah, messaging top brass absolute shit show. antivax idiots already paranoid enough, inconsistent messaging feeds stupidity. like detected twice US since October 3rd.

Still, masks good.  false sense security security. said yourself, end getting covid get sick. Thank you, great article. Makes even confident decision get kids vaccinated.  point protection hospitalization also waning now.  Also, Fauci admitted coy benchmarks statistics based public's willingness respond healthy behavior (getting vaxed past, getting boosted now). works really well people, really poorly others (inviting conspiracy theories), frustrates rest us listening closely emotional push either direction. likely Department Heath/CDC study name never mentioned. Medical records standardized fill forms going Emergency Room different doctor first time. Imagine much easier would ER Doctor COULD access family doctor's records you. use different software interface all.  swelling really, really suck. Surprisingly reaction Pfizer 1 2, lethargy flu Pfizer #3. Got serious neck lymph node swelling month ago, PCR Covid turned negative doctor said unlikely strep likely viral. even Covid grabbing headlines there's shortage regular fall crap spreading around. Yeah husband still mask indoors public settings. wouldn’t mind year pair flu shot, every six months putting lot people. Especially they’re sick boosters. can’t get time childcare etc. going tough situation going forward. Check Israel’s Data. way ahead us thing. said thing fauci saying right now….3 months ago. Also, unvaccinated spread virus much easily does, case vaccines trialed largely successful. Minimal serious side effects, known disseminated minor side effects. Honestly, I'm little surprised people struggling much right now. period ""Oh fuck, vaccines get-out-of-jail-free card"" happened months ago, Delta raging. I've mourned loss optimism, really, I'm feeling hell lot upbeat I've gotten booster. feel like holidays going much less fraught last year. cancelled 

Does Burgermeister live Gibraltar? go get check box dude   would guess mRNA technology something 5+% mortality rate would weeks months. 


When look category bioterrorism agents, 2 vaccines already, handful antibiotic regimens work pretty well. know much hemorrhagic viruses mRNA technology could used those.  one first times I’ve tempted spend money Reddit give award. Common sense seems hard come anymore. Well said sir.  still are! :) I'm sorry guys going rough time that, hope gets better time county CO reinstated mask mandates least boosters readily available local Walmart. always see people sitting chairs gives hope. saying based literally nothing. pisses need “lie” order get booster. open anyone would like ffs. Unlikely, possible.

SARS-CoV-2 mutate quickly. actually fairly stable/slow mutating viruses go. such, likelihood persistent every-x-months vaccinations low. 

What we're seeing decreased effectiveness vaccine due time. normal things vaccines. [Several childhood vaccines multi-dose 

My guess (purely guess) we'll need three, four, five doses total. first two shots month interval (Pfieser Moderna) eventually viewed single dose normal-for-other-vaccines two-to-four dose schedule effect give lasting protection.

Due massive number vaccine resisters may need whole second third round vaccines address mutations though. cops vaccinated Well, us hitting 6 month mark pretty soon, right? Yea, that's happens viruses evolve virulent.

When said 70 percent herd immunity, D614G (Italian) strain. Alpha bumped slightly, Delta absolutely obliterated number. Delta's basic reproductive rate 6.0 7.0 means previously effective mitigation numbers longer effective enough. Neutralization halved Delta, expected \~8-14 months protection got 6. novel disease we're working fast can. Get booster offered you: It'll get NAbs back sustainable levels. Well people asymptomatic covid. personally see tests done PcR machines? course not. China says virus spread imported frozen food (from US obviously), yet none import nations experiencing covid surge. Perhaps that’s China it. Look, China manufacturing capability ppe vaccine ample food supply. anyone “save” world, obviously China would appear play important role global stability. optic status enough CCP gain huge political leverage support naive masses. 
Did receive flu shot China covid? know what’s actually there? always show bravado control everything. know gonna say. Oh it’s conspiracy, coocoo. world pandemic crisis, would world leader willing take photo op head WHO? Xi would sit glorious room World media focused posing Tedro. World leaders saw right thru tricks. That’s world united CCP expansion Taiwan. 
Shenzhen big cities China built literally serve attract expats. Wonder still pay millions dollars recruit foreign trained talents talented immigrants pursue dreams US based merit (money comes prove themselves). 
Politics way shadier imagine. CIA, MI6 aren’t spy agencies. Russia China huge web networks. 
“Brainwashing” used China Russia CIA caught began exploring it. One thing sure. US much open free press. last time Chinese media exposed current leaders? Never. honestly think innocent, good old average Joe? Don’t silly, tennis girl currently re-educated telling truth wrong. Considering OP trends, think getting booster big takeaway. Working pharmacy heard question ""Have smoked 100 cigarettes life?"" hope people sarcastic stating 'I smoked one cigarette, non smoker"". Hope clarifies. question regards obtaining nicotine patches meds smoking cessation. Ah, sucks - symptoms like? 
I got booster week , original shots back March study reducing severe symptoms share? (Honest question) Sounds like cushy jobs security theater opening up! BMI 33 fat. muscly short lol felt awful, fatigue ache bad get bed husband same. said got J&amp;J know 2 series shots. husband got boosted last Friday get mine Friday Moderna. said felt aches joints shot site got red felt ok next day I'm hoping feel same. someone please help figure booster get? headlines myocarditis etc confusing me. 2xPfizer May able choose booster. need start accepting might persistent threat long time.

It threat like flu threat--likely forever. thing vaccines, even without booster dose, make COVID longer novel human body. huge even waning immunity, people's bodies semblance blueprint fighting disease. I'd guess even year two, vaccines still saving people serious outcomes. purpose stickers anyhow? someone plonk passport London promptly removed arrived back home. First thing understand Delta totally different beast. 70% talk original variants. 

At end day hospital deaths matters. Outside normal flu. Nope. every citizen would receive it, would still cost 1000 bucks. would pay next couple years lot vaccines get years apart done. still get Tdap every 10 years example. rushed without normal testing save millions lives. getting vaccine every 6 mo forever.    2 wishes US, realize complex stated are:

1 - insurance companies (who make billions profit solely middle man) putting back community keeps pockets filled (I honestly don’t think exist all, that’s separate issue)

2 - much controversial, wish could segregate “vocal, irate” anti- vaxxers refuse entering hospitals using resources/human energy don’t give damn (maybe anti-vax clinics anti-vax nurses doctors work) goes establishments, hospitals start  Funny story: day gonna get J&amp;J booster canceled got tested since felt kinda weird. Turns vaccinated hardly leaving house (not 2 years 12; worked home b4 fashionable) still get SARS-COV2.

1. KEEP WEARING MASK
2. really worse head cold me, get mild bacterial pneumonia azithromycin 2 weeks voilà.  Yeah you’re alone. I’ll get shot guess can’t way move forward. It’s incredibly shitty two years don’t seem getting better this.  Life pretty much back normal live save masks indoor settings eventually go away. Dr. Fauci ""the expert"" one working pharmacy credentials experience. pharmacy following minute's CDC recommendations change later week. 18and older qualify boosters discussed expected. Asking ""gotcha"" questions century global pandemic indicates ""you want told do"" versus learning vetted sources using best critical judgement. come one provide cogent explanation point good solid studies masks impact? mean randomized controlled studies vaccines can’t masks???  wonder individuals vaccinated bodies actually accept vaccine? neighbor tried 3 vaccines body literally produce antibodies.  nobody wants admit we’re never going back pre-COVID normal ever again. wanted believe right thing we’d someday it’s looking like masks yearly boosters way it’s going sooner everybody admits starts cope better we’ll be. Ehhhhh   Awful moment wave start.

My city 184 people hospitalized 45~ days ago. 40. number getting week week.  actual science paper, info backs idea SARS-CoV-2 natural origin Huanan Market:

**Dissecting early COVID-19 cases Studies shown losing biodiversity affects environment, microclimates, therefore climate, microclimates interlinked affect other, answer simply yes, connected, can't biodiversity collapse large scales without affecting climate variables, too. Despite desire pandemic ongoing winter months worse first year vaccines wearing off.   higher chance getting screwed over? fully vaccinated AZ living US. CDC seem allow booster shots originally :/, loophole? country got provide boosters either.  Thank you. Thanksgiving week away. Holiday travel kicks earnest, like, tomorrow. Plus anyone works within sniffing distance retail underwater. hadn’t able get daughter shot last week could totally see slipping til early Jan  Hell yeah getting boosted y’all  mention school age children beginning vaccinated huge numbers! make appointment Walgreens get it. sign paper saying high chance exposure that's it. smoking it? come down, smoker too! Everybody get booster still feel good it. Fully vaxxed here, spent 10 days hospital covid. fun. lot vaccines given many doses years apart. Covid probably except rush save millions lives. Feeling need defend stranger internet 💪 real chad move bruh keep 💪😩   Plus people lie vaccination status time now. Yep. booster / third dose vaccination rates US much lower regular vaccination rates surprising. Add colder weather states, mandatory holiday celebrations, going back work, people seeing COVID ""over,"" proven, people lie vaccination status time, especially U.S. ""breakthrough hospitalizations"" could well people lied.  Yep. hospital tube throat, vaccine worked Queens Thanks, I’ll try  Im old enough remember posts past summer declaring Covid      reason important many people smelling things there, like smoke something burning. means olfactory SENSES/SENSORS affected. neurological issue. Something gone wrong affected area brain. Phantom smells common people migraines smelling smoke present symptom stroke. study essentially saying COVID affecting brain negatively long term. causing particular issue many, else brains it? Sometimes things seem inconsequential lead major breakthroughs understanding. case rather minor long term symptom points long term neurological change, means missing lot long haul COVID really affecting. tells us need keep looking COVID brains might changing way work. yeah little worse 2nd shot. 36 hours shot I'm back like 95%. rougher lol Serious question experience hospitals try ask questions way allow patient answer truthfully without judgment.

For example, San Francisco ask generic questions like:

- last month many people identify biologically male sex with.

... opposite well.

This STD screenings trying identify risk profiles people may exposed HIV. 

It seems like might need something similar covid.

My example might perfect I've noticed many questions formulated bias answer.  Covid bit different rest - far rapid mutation rate. Insurance companies, Medicare Medicaid require vaccination condition coverage Covid-related illnesses. continue cover conditions. 

Refusers treated anyway, resulting bills drive bankruptcy. pay decisions. Happy help. ever going stop?  I’m day 7 covid. Symptoms aside, knowing you’re positive anxiety inducing. Hope get okay! Drink plenty rest. Meanwhile, I've seen people public (my kids school, grocery store, etc) without masks last week year. Apparently we're done masks Central Florida. live area rhat pretty good masks, too. I'm scared we're gonna see uptick undo progress we've made. don’t see “can’t way forward.” effective easier alternative we’d employ it. We’re best we’ve got, always. me! got covid last December. sense smell used be. bring things closer nose get full aroma now. 

I also get lots whiffs motor oil often scent there. I'm boosted personally feel like I'm getting taken ride.


I've following pandemic vaccines closely things proceeding expected based things read almost two years ago. got booster (tip: instant feel aches chills take fever reducer like tylenol advil, repeat necessary) expect I'll need another booster year, three years that, 5 years. I'm predicting next summer things less open much country.

If feel like lied to, humbly suggest unrealistic expectations based bad information.  situation to. 20 months later issues getting work completed. Company asked feedback disabled comments return communication getting much pushback. Don’t know asked feedback nothing ever going change minds made up.

It seem like trend everyone going hybrid. majority week still spent office don’t get it. pandemic squashed belief people can’t productive home. outdated thinking executives way touch regular employee. still believe people want go office option. force everyone shown capability successful home dumb. might entitled viewpoint guarantee I’m one feels way. I’ve seen opinions company people align views. think it’s entitled viewpoint executives want go back way was.  Maybe I'm splitting hairs really minor wind Long Covid? talking minor respiratory symptoms?

I feel like anything ends brain cardiovascular damage is, nature, minor. you’ll never reach 90’+% need keep hospitals getting overcrowded it’s yearly shot. Flu doesn’t impacts low vaccination rates. It’s wild downvoted. I’m really disappointed lot people’s reaction boosters. getting shot every year really terrible fate? Sigh. Definitely every six months, won’t know answer without observation time. Secondary immune responses greater longer lasting. Peter Hotez, well respected vaccinologist, thinks 3 doses may last several years. Others say probably yearly boosters. Regardless, think “fully vaccinated” 3 doses now, whatever booster future holds. 

”It’s hard make prediction, especially future.”

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* made sign booster. Thank you. still get covid vaccinated surprise? risk hospitalization lowered obviously. 

Wishing steadfast recovery. got booster two days ago FINALLY feel mostly better today. continue stay date boosters, really need deal amount symptoms cause people. last two absolutely wrecked me, body pain aches point crying nausea point vomiting. cool.  can’t way forward? Flu shots already annual. ultimately best protecting threats. shot every year best reasonably that’s way is. long COVID main thing scares me, real. hospitalization. Maybe irrational, idea disease lingering months affecting day day life....nope, nope. J&amp;j destroyed day of, pfizer boosted today, feel great.

No issues previous stew whatever army gave gazillion times. generally true. Repeated exposures / boosters cause antibodies bind tightly outgrow weaker ones. came complete surprise, though. Nobody could possibly known we'd winter year... That's want vaccine. tactical advantage spreading virus.   Well happening. point people gotta realize shit stay, obviously china thank! get COVID body literally builds immune it…. get sick?? weak immune system study take account mask *discipline?*

We indoor mask mandate state most, all, people comply with. one really enforces except formal situations though, stress enforcing long past point worth emotional energy so.

Casually, even pro-mask people ""mostly"" wear right. fall lot, pull every minutes drink coffee, etc... mess face lot, especially talking taking place. reduce efficacy.

I've become mask-agnostic since October, observed masking works restaurants theatrical sham.  pro-mask pro restriction state. 

Now, social situations start masked try gauge seriousness group &amp; feel comfortable them, ask, ""I'm vaccinated boosted, want ditch masks?"" Usually say yes. Occasionally say household member condition we'll keep on. Realism   Lmao missed constitution says right eat Bloomin Onion high risk spreading deadly disease. Pfizer already, wondering get full Moderna dose (including 2nd dose) instead booster? (Or vice versa). 

Related: boosters “updated” version that’s effective newest variants? 

I’ve seen studies reputable orgs saying mix match actly effective, even boosters thing many months ago. afaik, voluntary demand vax reduced so, don’t see good reason get booster instead full dose diff vax. But, I’m expert followed news well. 

As close ELI5’s possible highly desired appreciated. Bro you’re coronavirus subreddit expecting read    Ive heard, countries also much higher mask use Winter here. company asked Vax attestation actual proof. back office yet (though they're open) they're much liberal pro-vax /pro-mask / great covid communications policies kind org. get booster antivaxx piece shit blood hands. Listen science.  sure. gladly believe civil society. blows mind people want vaccine. work fucking airport! nothing wrong honest discussion experience, especially making faulty conclusions anecdotal experience. applaud sensible, hope neither side twists words unfairly try share it.

As pointed rare, doesn’t make less real. It’s possible would gotten lucky got Covid instead vaccine fine, maybe somehow impact means Covid would hit extremely hard, don’t know point. suspect you’re still happy protected now, even experience sucked. can’t imagine experiencing idea would stop bad could get, like people long Covid less understood situations; feel nothing sympathy.

So many choices pandemic feel like roll dice extent, least vaccine odds favorable level control. hope you’re able arrange things (e.g. time work) need booster get full protection once/if current immunization starts wane, even better don’t side effects. would focus trying get good sleep, less stress (easier said done), eating healthy, etc booster didn’t cause problems alone, things add inflammation reactions make reaction worse. really hope things go better though, really hope figure time make clear sensible.  mom got j&amp;j booster july, previously fully vaccinated Sinovac (inactivated virus) still need additional j&amp;j shot okay since first one booster? US goingback march-april there's way getting booster since country approved anyone. 


Also, brother wife j&amp;j, got may planning traveling soon either, know antibodies decrease get booster 2 months first j&amp;j shot mean they're pretty much vulnerable unvaccinated people still protected enough? Thank you. Jesus that’s horrible. Sorry hear that.  kid 4.5 years old, think thats stance would take. Lets give 1 month see happens. already nearly 2 years. think he's position admit much anything tbh  * German politicians learning hard way can't end pandemic declaring over.
* German people learning hard way wanting normal life back bring normal life back.
* German experts getting frustrated ""told months ago"" moment. I’m sure assume know much anything vaccines based comment ;) Long time Tokyo resident here. Yes, vaccinations slow get started. quickly caught up, 70% vaccinated. never real lock down. Restaurants/department stores closed early. That's it. everyone wears mask, everyone. Hell, even homeless guys wear mask. convinced masks make difference. seems short circuit transmission covid nowhere go dies. rest world always hurry "" get back normal"" see clearly happens people/countries much hurry. soon back started worse. WEAR MASK!! WORKS!! get wherever. Doesn’t matter.  Vaxxed fuck people go work sick  Paranoid caught liar? last 2 shots Moderna got walmart pharmacy, pfizer booster get CVS places?

Or get walmart, walmart seem  
that..... great, suppose havn't heard problems there.   got booster weeks ago CVS said nothing like that. looked time found CDC said fine get whatever want. little confusion experience.    Yep, thanks  Post-Thanksgiving surge America going put Europe's current surge shame. keep trying explain BIL, doesn’t care  That's bigger problem incentives. politicians strong incentives build PR image cost, lying, minimizing, bullshitting, keep job. Politicians countries strong incentives make agencies bullshit people ours, hurt country without going war raise status comparison. Ordinary citizens strong incentives eat whatever bullshit happen fed, shitload free time resources fight past it.  FDA expected authorize boosters adults soon. places though make appointment self-attest eligible.       pandemic shown world small braindead biological terrorists live among us. get vaxxed move different planet. really unaccaptable corpses laid corridor hospitals (Oberösterreich) literally room store them.  wouldn’t imply 3 them? get higher rated mask want greater protection, ie KN95. said previous supporter Anti-Vaxxers. 

Where however Western European forced give medical consent threat jail regarding vaccine?  OK, received Moderna first? Judging experience pretty much \_every\_ vaccine child calendar, nearly three shots, cases far removed booster 5-10 years later.

The third really ""booster"", part program start, kind hurry. got mine 7 months, daughter wanted get booster day got first dose. would done right months otherwise. Covid likely endemic Oh good. first moderna shot next day felt like someone socked arm. 2nd one pulled something like 103 F temp knocked 1 1/2 days. Interested see one do. Speaking myself, CDC throughout stuck science known time. first decision knowledge science there, said much, made political moral argument approving booster. 

So, admission, _science_ showed boosters beneficial, thought would somehow take away vaccines rest world.  share source that? data saw Israel (on Pfizer) information Moderna shared doesn’t seem indicate that, also trouble keeping up.   completely take onboard point quite correctly made Austria. also completely agree unvaccinated ones mainly dying getting hospitalised. 

I want say respect anyone refuses vaccine 'anti-vaxx' believe weird conspiracy.

I nothing argue written except one thing. Summer, Austria must vaccinated population what, 35- 40 per cent opposed 65 per cent now? anti vaxxers still healthcare system breaking point. leaves 2 variables changed since Summer. Winter waning vaccine. Logically must main factors then. There’s national mask mandate multiple Asian countries too, virus still surging across South Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia, etc. delta variant transmissible, breaking social distancing safety measures.

Good hear you’re finally getting vaccines. Hope rollout vaccines quick smooth.  Anti-vaxxers ruining people's lives.  They're passionate. understandable wonder many people protest going anti-vaxxers?   expand hospital capacity? makes feel better, thanks! Wow cool anecdotal story!  Ok, seems likelihood bearing risk/reward already accept fasting pandemic. ie. fact autophagy culls least fit white blood cells, potentially weakening immune system duration fast…but replenishes brand new white blood cells break fast refeed….which course might positive turns refreshed renewed white blood cell count puts greater risk Cytokine storm happen catch Covid wrong time.  I’m 30s got nasty headache chills 2nd Moderna, little tired third. biggest surprise article malaria seems protect people covid! Friday, researchers working Uganda said found COVID-19 patients high rates exposure malaria less likely suffer severe disease death people little history disease. course! never way go Nope. Take look link. church.  one correct me, mix match bonus small. Getting 3rd shot important, trying coordinate 3rd alternative manufacture. OP, I’m 42, dad bod, Pfizer first two (no effects 1st, ~12 hours fatigue 2nd) Moderna booster day arm soreness. fatigue, fever  Fatal title error, unfortunately. ""All adults"" important distinction. Hospitals already turning away patients capacity limited. countries (Singapore) already requiring unvaxed pay expenses. companies US (Deltal) already raised insurance premiums unvaxed. Finally, reasonable German speaking country. know what's wrong us! Instead enforcing measures non-vaccinated, Bavarian government cancels fun things vaccinated..  No. ok hate government.  Try others. Mine scheduled Sam's club. think lot people think store boosters. schedule wide open whereas local pharmacies booked.  people might vaccinated. fellow clinical trial folks at? I'm curious anyone trial gotten theirs. novavax tried get booster pharmacy even though eligible. got impression check box either moderna, Pfizer JnJ since mine ""other"" know do. can't verify eligibility. Clinical trial said announcing timeline boosters I'm sure I'm willing wait. Ok. Well time expand hospital capacity lean heavily post infection treatments. assume happening every winter foreseeable future, restrictions cannot continue. 

Arranging society people get sick neither practical sustainable. need move forward knowledge acceptance people *will* getting sick. Yup agreed. 

I feel there’s end game point.  High score wins $$  Could antibody titers hint longevity? addition, know anecdotal mom got stronger reaction Moderna half-dose booster even second full dose primary injections. Well, TBE turns idiot. Nobody would like idiot, would now? 🙃 western europe least, already plenty mandatory vaccinations. nothing new, people getting butthurt this? face. wonder people apprehensive. Oh that’s terrible. Pregnant women high risk COVID. hope find one works Austria, am. main people filling hospitals anti-vaxxers. Upper Austria, hordes anti-vaxxers, mess, highest rates Austrian states, corpses (of primarily anti-vaxxers) hospital hallways. 2 million unvaxxed spreading like crazy other. made get boosters yet. Indeed refusal wear masks plays major role too, Austria primary problem anti-vaxxers. One weirdest things Africans Norther countries extremely high risk dying Covid. probably vitamin D: 3x Pfizer. 3rd also worst me. curious- side effects intense also short lived. Like you, muscle aches joint pain like I’ve never experienced night vaccine. seem like everything hurt time. Even rolling bed difficult. Day two rough day 3, less back normal little bit sore arm. look bright side seems really strong immune reaction hopefully means body cranking antibodies. 

For wife, 3rd much easier second. guess everyone’s biology bit different it’s hard predict bad side effects be.  That's valid opinion have, I
 want point making people pay treatment outright refusing far radical steps take mandating vaccine.  fasting autophagy benefit danger Covid around?

Neither. means get Covid, virus might block autophagy. fast, body still break fat energy, dead cells normally clears would stay instead. paper approaches subject direction - says nothing whether fasting help, harm, completely irrelevant terms helping avoid (or recover from) Covid.  3 weeks, actually 6% Africa’s population vaccinated…where’s covid disaster?  CDC recommends sticking Moderna/Pfizer original, literally said mixing fine too. line sure. Doesnt matter much, moderna could bit better  true. 40 50% deaths 80 vaccinated. obviously mean vaccination work, means old people seriously risk due weakened immune systems need protected around them. Former government employee here. confirm it. vaccine becomes mandatory become criminals, actually go jail stupid. Except mutate fast flu does, talking variants strains. COVID started mutate faster point needed new vaccines every year liken flu would terrifying. vaccines effective variants prevalent. None seem able compete Delta far new VOCs emerging compared earlier pandemic. I’m bit dilemma booster shot. got second dose moderna mid March live abroad country yet administering boosters general population. There’s talk approval coming soon (even within matter weeks) Im sure hard timeline. plan return US February, worst case scenario could get booster think it’s realistic able get officially country live then. Im verge going first dose I’m concerned it’ll cause issues documentation. live Europe COVID health passes I’m worried go dose won’t work QR code cause slew issues me… guys think it’s ok hold little more? There’s talk boosters approved whole population live matter weeks-month. I’m getting little anxious seeing headlines people without booster getting sick. Brah, week.  ""Evidence""  Yeah, mean old people probably anyway, 30 year olds like took soon could age group NY I'm really concerned that. 6 months since second shot. Even still wouldn’t eliminate COVID spread.  gonna cause austria revolutionize soon got pfizer booster 2 weeks ago. confirm, worthless 3 days. thing I’ve seen regeneron needed wait 90 days receive first dose, don’t think type advice like booster long don’t active illness.

I would imagine body seen virus 3 times fourth gonna nothing. never get vaxxed want it. lot anti vaxxers homeschool anyway.

I'm familiar ""culture"" going get vaxxed want to. want society change meet religious demands. Also, Pope Baptist. disagree anti-vaxxers main reason cases rising. 75 % vaccinated Japan vs 65 % Austria. 

There completely different culture Asia regarding masks versus Europe. seeing vaccinated 80 year old people vulnerable walking around supermarkets London without masks social distancing. nothing anti-vaxx population.

I mentioned winter previous post. See weather Tokyo week compared alpine areas Austria. (Its 18 degrees sunny Tokyo tomorrow) people twitter agree views

They're top scientists fields medicine public health. Literally among impactful field bibliometric measures. Copied above: ""Austria lot intensive care beds, 2020 second intensive care beds per capita OECD even corona Austria criticized waste public funds amount spent hospital beds."" do.

they improvise shit hits fan fuck rest time. Same... got Pfizer 1,2 Moderna 3. Full dose. Said first.   Debtor’s Prison old society itself. Luckily, don’t US (you file bankruptcy) still thing South Korea, instance. I'm 33 got sick first dose 3 days second dose felt tired symptoms. third dose knocked hard weird symptom legs falling asleep felt like constant pins needles body aches fatigue lasted week. Still worth though. would've stylin' late 90s. 🎶Movies, movies, movies, want movies wanna see Starz!🎶  boyscouts really changed since one.. tie knots backyards.   deaths (2 3) happened 2021, year would even worse. got pfizer first time around too, opted moderna booster since doctor told that's plans get hers. 1st pfizer breeze. arm soreness, it. 2nd dose hell. sure taking Advil ok find anything time definitive suffered without. moderna booster pretty shitty (I'm still recovering, got Wednesday afternoon), took Advil needed think made *as* bad. also made sure take extra precautions make little bearable. made sure keep water + advil near me. bones hurt, legs also killing 32 Degrees leggings Costco I'm glad helped! way Austria ever 100% vaxxed

Of course never get 100%, also never needed. seems like way convince idiots, steadily increase pressure.   Getting jabbed price pay want get paid fondle people. Many fines Austria work way. cause accident cannot payout party jail. cause harm ppl cannot compensate jail. Well way ppl think twice causing damage, unpunished incentives behave.   Amen that! Vaccine mandates nothing new. question bad situation justify them. Austrian health care system close collapsing think that‘s damn good justification.

Two months ago would never argued favor mandates options point are

-	Eternal lockdowns everyone
-	Accepting collapse health care system
-	Vaccine mandate Pfizer available wanted get it. opposed favour vaccination? 
This seems far opinion - heart disease leading cause death last year avoidable good diet exercise. mandate mandatory weight maximums order participate society? Imagine Marine’s first line supervisor Can’t find answer anywhere…why vaccine mRNA?? can’t take time make regular ones anti-vax people would used to/comfortable with? Eastern Europe Russia even worse state. Poland exceeded 20% point, sure now, think around 23%. (Not competition puts things perspective.)    close percentage 6 months ago. would made huge impact trajectory continued. 37156 new cases. Although cases last week, testing also positive share tests increased. trust government numbers. ""no end sight"" Covid-19 pandemic Russia yet, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday.

That says pretty much situation.   I’m optimistic new medication, it’s cure-all. effective treatment prevention. 

And make dent outcomes enough appropriate people take it. Aka unvaccinated overwhelming majority covid cases. think going take medication? Thanks! already googling! Argh! wish known…I would’ve fasted earlier!!! told eat much get “strong.” truth force eat…I really didn’t want to! Here's data vaccination rate fatality   mean, we're 69% least one shot that's including children slower uptake. highest risk groups 85% fully vaxxed .The hospitals still full. 

The cases decreased decreased, never ever going away almost certainly mutate, surge, regress predictable unpredictable ways. 

Point people know dying covid rest life. Vaxxed unvaxxed.  guess would far less tourists Europe America Asia well tied factors Google Youtube search Prof Valter Longo keywords like fasting cancer chemotherapy etc.

Theres genuine valid science behind confused usual Pseudo-Science alternative medicine ‘X CUrEs CaNceR !!’ BS. Vaccines safe serve societal good. Consent irrelevant. Right?! want whole ""my body. choice"" thing JOIN US MILITARY.  effective post-infection treatments available soon. late outbreak Colorado anti-viral pills soon. Lmao government that's goes.

Theres chance half people responsible figuring details learned news release lol also went Weds, 3x Pfizer. side effects except sore arm. time, lot fatigue body aches starting subside (Friday). However, also got flu shot time, also usually never react to, two may pushed edge time. that’s okay! refuse lie. I'll wait cleared days (CDC advisory committee CDC State guidance pharmacies themselves). qualify current guidance.

Hopefully time next week... Yeah. forgot leave comment how, teachers teaching kids! 😞     boyscout, think roughest thing Iditarod-like event, pulling dogsleds, without dogs.

My troop broke sled ski descending steep hill (hit small concealed stump), ended-up carrying sled rest way. finished dead last. quite late time returned camp.

I also 'fond' memories making pankcakes trip cheap non-stick frying-pans, non-stick coating coming coating pancakes. Yum! Push April safe. wouldn’t January. 
I expect restrictions unpleasant life EU till spring “Folks” say lot things aren’t true  really depends waning immunity leads severe cases remains infections. 

If infections dont lead hospitalizations boosters required except risk.. risk sever outcome increases rate immunity wanes full sure need boosters going forward.  Might case virus infect everybody enough immunity acquired avoid high death rates. Swedes experiencing better outcome current wave due natural immunity earlier, less lethal alpha variant, employed virus ""burn out"" strategy.

Perhaps would wise devise strategy based everybody getting illness, rather assume everybody get taking steps avoid it. think new covid pills Pfizer Merck, along new antibodies discovered, would allow person get infected intentionally natural immunity acquired, treat new antiviral medications. 

This may sound foolish, see way avoid cyclical lock downs spurred antibody decline vaccinated, combined huge death toll illnesses can't treated due limited hospital resources. I've always found disturbing Google Translate interprets total number deaths site 'cumulative got rid of'... Notice children fall section 2 article 7 stating best interest takes priority everything else. children incapable giving informed consent meaning article 6 (the ""nothing may done without prior informed consent patient"" article) apply.  exception contained Article 8 treaty icluding exception stating that: emergency situation appropriate consent cannot obtained, medically necessary intervention may carried immediately benefit health individual concerned.

this would never apply vaccinating conscious people anyway, even argue best interest - may - still cannot use article bypass consent they're conscious cognizant. even worse.  appreciate anyone could give advice. friend tested positive COVID-19 today, tested negative earlier week. last saw two days ago wore masks whole time. near two hours. told health services it, I'm sure do. mask around roommates whole time, concerned?   think anyone actually knows, slightly worrying. everyone seems theory.

Germany low vaccination rate help, course, cases rising significant (but slightly slower) rate many neighbours.

One theory Germany's relatively low rate previous infections that's giving problems now, would otherwise cover quite lot unvaccinated (and give immunity boost quite lot vaccinated). explain Netherlands, growing Germany's speed many recorded infections (per capita) USA, UK high-infection countries.

A new variant would detected now, surely...

Germany strict mask rules ages too, seem slowed case growth vs. neighbouring countries less strict rules.

Getting bit meta: thing I'm concerned fact commentators influence (e.g. prominent scientists, randoms Reddit like me) talked this, instead cherry-picked single examples make crude point could easily invalidated looking available data.   wear seat belt still killed accident, restrictions requiring wear seat belt?

Why perform surgery as-sanitary-as-practical environments still get infection die surgery?

Why hardhats required job sites people still die head injuries?

I find odd probability something occurring lost people regurgitate ""vaccinated *can* still carry COVID"" line. assume they're otherwise generally aware many things life precautions reduce eliminate chance poor outcome, that's observe safety measures.

I smell stuff, really muted. wife gags things even notice. I'm fairly sure i've never covid, 100% sure pre-dates years decades.  estimated around 93% UK adults carry antibodies covid. increase even rapid rollout boosters. Even rate protection we're still seeing avg 150 deaths/day.

(We’re fully vaccinated going get covid tested way FYI) half country (US) obsessed ""gain-of-function"" research, even though I'm pretty sure really true understanding actually - lot thinks virus likely engineered leaked purpose take certain orange politician. 

But yes, naturally occurring virus, exactly outbreak happened, well may never know sure, I'm reasonably certain harebrained theory stated above. technically correct. believed accurate several months ago. Humoral immunity neutralizing antibodies would fade time antibodies broken cellular immunity memory cells / B cells would remain long term.

Which said information 148 days ago. date. assumption cellular immunity would remain effective preventing infections since proven wrong real world data.

Yes, administering boosters still result humoral immunity fading time. current data Israel shows time period extended least 9-10 months. Possibly more, need wait end study.

With rollout booster shots, increase humoral immunity, even temporarily, would result significant decrease number infections thus severe hospitalizations deaths.

Is answer acceptable you? interesting, course makes perfect sense.

Countries high vaccination rates likely fewer restrictions, therefore sustain higher case rate (because lower hospitalisations, etc.); countries high vaccination rates likely richer therefore testing.

Which leads question: healthy look case numbers all? least ""daily reported cases"" kind way. really useful information aggregate tell much situation. Actually covid simillar coronavirus -.-' ... around hundreds years.
If look accomolated knowledge gathered years coronavirus, concluded immunity going wane possibly infinite boosters going needed.
Seriously, repeated topic early 2020, scientist saying never produced sucessful vaccine agaisnt coronavirus immunity always short lived.

So guess agree you, 90% sure answer, waiting confirmation. Weird, asking austria prepared comment describing german perspective. Anyways linked video describe POV ICU expert: hospital system collapse…

Yes, thats case. German we're close aswell, german patients getting flown italy medical helicopters, non life threatening surgeries cancelled. federal states announced de facto lockdown aswell.

If didnt vaccinations we'd even bigger tragedy, quota ICU admission 0,8% cases whereas else would 6-7% according Prof Uwe mentions 0.8% video, also gave interview tagesschau24 minutes ago describing situation without vaccines, couldnt find video though, live tv.

Thanks wishes. talked today actually sounded pretty good felt better I'm much optimistic chances now. data 3 weeks course is. several studies. Waiting longer doses means longer time risk disease, one dose little efficacy delta.

Yes, likely. three weeks shortest possible time period anyone thought could possibly effective, tested optimal time period. I'm sure anyone pretending otherwise. anyone get booster now? Last checked high risk only.

For anyone who's wondering, part reason prior infection considered equal vaccination terms immunity.  Lt. Umfrage sind 60% dafür, also scheiße glaufn für di.

Thank you. reality is, part knows this, part wants so.

Fully vaccinated, booster, still masking public avoiding groups crowds. keep up, would rather not, humans adapt. Haha opinions change fast, week ago nobody believed vaccine mandate would happen austria Austrian here, two points, court involved process. one goes jail even hours willingly...

So yes, everybody paying parking tickets usually... Federal level, regulation currently blocked appeals process, applies unvaccinated individuals.

If state approved plan want consult allowed stricter standards OSHA.  1.7 abysmal tho, even considering low adult rates  writing covid passes could used stop unvaccinated going work, restaurants shops music concerts etc etc writing Austria doesnt options. Didn’t CDC panel essentially already vote back reviewing boosters first time? Walensky overruled allowed boosters least 18 high-risk occupations. Right? Thanks couldn’t find it. wondering unvaccinated unmasked kids drove high numbers cases UK. Cases already rising US: Hospitalizations rising among fully vaccinated U.S., Fauci says ""What we’re starting see uptick hospitalizations among people who’ve vaccinated Michigan hospitalizations spike; state hits 70% vaccine COVID-19 hot spots like Colorado may offer sign what’s ahead U.S.

Last 3 articles shared sub, order new look US tag. Got mine two weeks ago don’t really qualify. Go get one want one; big chain pharmacies like cvs, Walgreens, Walmarts, etc aren’t asking meet eligibility criteria, don’t provide proof Spring 2020, we’ve person full time. kid’s class made far without single case cause quarantine. (Not classes lucky.)

All adults, teachers, faculty, support staff, etc. we’re required get soon eligible.

The school 18 months 3rd grade, 5+ required school fully vaccinated (both +2 weeks) holidays. still number younger five preschool, though, still precautions.

We’re social compact, included things like dining inside restaurants (outdoor dining fine, getting chilly). loosens vaccinated, looking forward that.

My county (Montgomery County, MD right next DC) 99.9% 12+ least one dose according CDC, we’re REALLY strict around here, I’ve happy it. realize sever cases uncaccinated right? hospitals unvaccinated?

You people unbelievably fucking stupid.  ""Even near 70 percent""? 70% total vaccinated, course they're going problems. They're barely ahead US single doses they're even behind UK terms 2 doses. like 5% boosted, half US 1/8th Chile Uraguay. Germany poorly vaccinated compared places 90%-100% population least one dose.

 UAE 98%/88%/30% vaccinated (1/2/3 doses) problems, would say that. They're 50 cases/week per million people (that would like US 1500 cases per week) 0.2 deaths/week per million (which would like 6 deaths per week US). 

Otoh, Gibraltar rough week terms cases, population small stochastic effects important bit slow adopt boosters (they jumped \~25% 40% past 2 weeks, we'll see they're couple weeks affects cases). Hey thanks that. Hopefully it’s lifelong thing, see… true, there's still value announcement.

For example, case, multiple doctors differing opinions weighing question whether get booster. antibodies drawn early Oct. high (#teammoderna). result, primary care doctor felt like skip booster, least now. month later allergist/asthma doctor tells me, ""we recommend patients get booster.""

So someone like me, actually find value FDA approval. learned today Austria making vaccination mandatory all. makes clever business sense austria make vaccination mandatory. 100% vaccinated, become number one european tourist destination. People want feel safe travel.  checked constitutional judges beforehand, could make public todays Press conference. Yes meant aren’t good stopping transmission stopping severe disease

Portugal around 88% population vaccinated seeing small wave. I’m afraid need everyone society develop immunity(vaccination/ infection) stop waves giving organs CAUSING person die. help live, opinion totally different.

We FDA disclaimers effectiveness sorts products. vaccines treated differently? also less testing done, less cases counted.

This scarily ridiculous completely unacceptable far vaccines available. ??? high proportion older people vaccinated. contrast, UK high proportion older people vaccinated, fewer young people. Naturally means people hospital Germany.   Nope. She'll approve easily! Yeah year honestly wearing 2020. vaccine people brainless thus surges could way control is. I’m scared variants could coming up. 

I doubt every 6 months. likely year like flu shot. helps lol. Jeebus. What?! “An ounce prevention worth pound cure” still holds true. 5-11 year olds started getting vaccinated days ago it’s still going days see additional protection first shot weeks get total protection two. may enough stop spread completely prevent lot people getting Covid otherwise would. No, hospitals close getting full. way?

hmmmm....I think few:

1) one freaking impfzentrum cover city 1 million people, mention locate centrally people travel hour way get there. can't even count many people know tried book vaccine months get in. us got shots purely due random luck - doc one offering vaccine since I've patient years got - unfortunately could take randoms small office capacity maintaining normal care patients. others finally got vaccinated employers arranged shots teams families. took long time employer sponsored vaccinations even begin was, usual, big regulatory kerfuffel around it.

2) even without mandatory vaccinations, sure hell could introduced 2G rules months ago

3) nix re-opening bars clubs well woods. 

4) sending big pile unvaxed kids back school...also really on. Yeah get concerns letting return normalcy, know TWO families whose kids tested positive last two weeks.

And best part is, smaller markets around city cancelled (yet), big one Marienplatz. guess people want hit market going go? LITTLE ONES - even packed ever. fucking ridiculous. idea hell thinking. hope helps one cares going follow recommendation. one handful people still working mask high end salon metro Detroit, none immune compromised little old ladies wear one. moved on. week I've hearing everyone's plans holidays * eye roll * *might* take really suffering - course, point it’s generally late help. 

Just... agreeing again. hope, suppose. certainly bad news think it’s worth pointing covid cases still far far time last year despite far infectious variant despite society largely going back normal. Vaccines work plenty boosters plus 5-11 year olds getting vaccinated I’m confident avoid winter like last year. Weeew, right? It’s like…I dunno…life could back normal everybody‘s vaccinated. Walgreens even let schedule mix match website, might company policy, weird desk staff going let get pharmacist overruled them. appreciate advice. I'll get test soon can. idea rules school said me, makes confused. expand hospital capacity?

Start cloning nurses, obviously! seriously, agree prevention absolutely critical. 

Paying staff nurses aides wages commensurate expertise (and commensurate profits/endowment hospital) might also help. also see elderly, obese people self-driving carts without masks dumbfounded. would like honest answers this.

Here argument completely falls apart. already tons evidence sorts things COVID **does** cause **some** people.

Frankly can't, virus vaccine. thing vaccine elicit myocarditis, inflammation caused immune system. exactl inflammation caused virus, except much reduced rate. mitigated small dose vaccine little vaccinated people still get covid (I sure did)

You're aware point vaccine make sure virus immune system encountering known it, right? Allowing production antibodies swiftly efficiently. matter give virus enough time cause significant damage. Hence efficacy bad outcomes great. getting infected cherry top high antibody count waiting bit data mean child get covid period

Of course doesn't. neither wearing seatbelt next run grocery store. playing unneeded Russian roulette tangible reason whatsoever. people never going listen. necessary. far many people like pompously talk solidatiry community, watching sticking together, forth, that's -- talk.

Kinda sucks you’re SOL right thing got vaccinated. Free speech is, rightfully, also restricted Austria. deny Holocaust sentenced prison sentences. different tamiflu works early though need people tested tested faster I'm concerned new expectation vaccinated people live get vaccinated all.

My point booster brought protection back 2 doses beyond. lot 3 dose vaccines get kids, I'm hopeful could another 3 dose vaccine.

But neither us know boosters going needed going forward 3 doses end, wait see.   Yes, repeat 1912 pandemic morons back refused mask now. still testing safety vaccine years study, definitely bullshit. saying testing safety 2 weeks?

So yeah, ""SUPER CAUTIOUS"" risk COVID poses young child significant way.

Yeah, scientists also told us wear masks. wear multiple masks. told us travel traveled. told us would several years vaccine approved use. suddenly multiple approved use months later. need lecture intelligence. know data gathered. also know fewer 2% kids infected COVID even wind hospital son 100% healthy rich generally educated, educated generally vaccinated.

Big issue lockdown unvaccinated help enforced late. People give shit, still trying ""get out"", maybe even stubbornness.   Let start saying I'm totally people encouraged getting vaccinated.

However making mandatory I'm concerned increase risk unrest protests.

It's also helped far right party hold Austrian policies. exposure pathogen boosters like getting booster? words, immunity keep getting stronger time?    Vaccine administering errors rare largely discount risk. Side effects vary person person. I'd rather force vaccinate die horrible death treatmet. feel 0 empathy general treating extreme. Although taking resources others health conditions due stupidity.  Aww come fuck man. really believed shots gonna keep safe worry going hospital. shots legit, there's people 2 shots going hospital 3? WTF PLEASE GO AWAY COVID  Good luck mandate see happening Europe.

Why not? already mandatory vaccines Europe, like measles Germany. 30% Austrians unemployed Ireland kinda bucks trend, 92% adults (91% 12) fully vaccinated still spiralling case numbers. Weather definitely important factor. Depends money go pub first place. like telling return work incentive job. people captured prior incentives consider.. Dropping hundred euro get vaccinated least could done. Isnt also kind stick though? long 2 shots considered fully vaccinated, run Covid stats people get lumped “Non Vaccinated” statistics they’ve booster.  Getting rid informed consent, one pillars modern medicine. doubt good trust medical system. good decision! Austria shows courage responsibility. Netherlands follow suit mandatory vaccine too. always vaccinate reduce risk Covid-positive. vaccine mandates lockdowns stop spread deaths risk mutation.

Does someone's right get vaccinated supersede right able leave home? right someone able open business (which may entire livelihood)?  ""Get jab could go pub again"" incentive imo nurse (Australia) charged fraud allegedly taking bribes inject specific people placebo (saline solution) instead real vaccine.

In case resulted caught, nurse allegedly highschool student. sure parents' sole request child it.

Incentives giving money. would work quickly certain subset people, cost much less long run good bad? self treat home get better, hospital space available need it?

What _are_ talking about? Society protected people carrying disease history. first involuntary quarantine described Leviticus, 7th century BC. 

Later examples like [Typhoid simply confirmed this. 

As boy, allowed school without standard vaccinations. allowed travel Africa without smallpox vaccination, still proudly scar. eradicated smallpox, opinion, ""My right spread disease trumps right die,"" simply exist 1960s. 

""Informed consent"", [posterior]. 

We, actually informed people world, ever right protect delusional science deniers refuse participate protecting weaker members society horrible death.

What really saying this: ""One person's right irrational unjustified beliefs actions much important everyone else's right die horribly.""

A society allows small number delusional individuals freely endanger everyone else based provable lies told proud sociopaths broken society.  isn't. 

In UK smallpox vaccination infants used mandatory (in 1800's) opposition law introduced. surprised opponents used similar phrasing yours. best knowledge vaccine ever made mandatory.

As know despite efforts naysayers smallpox completely eradicated. possible Germany data protection laws? seems nobody keeps permanent records whether someone vaccinated. Presumably they'd set lot infrastructure make sure legal.      collaborative people would angry idiots paid idiots

Sometimes, life, there's 'being right' 'getting good end result', paths overlap.

You either stew miserable situation patting back morally superior, get final result want. jab could go pub again"" incentive imo

Well, much idea. 30% population empathy-devoid.  really check (Netherlands) doing. great. 23k infections day huge us. Estimations 2% Netherlands infected currently. However... infections yes, hospitalization almost none fully vaccinated 70. much milder decease vaccinated. Probably people suppressed immune systems. I’ve seen antibody numbers per vaccine goes exponentially 1st 2nd 2nd 3rd. 

After third vaccine antibody levels many, many, many, many times higher first, third might enough, maybe fourth another year so. scientist btw, read lot this.       Ever see Rick Morty episode take daily pills?  dispute data reality boosters awesome, thus got one made sure family got soon possible. 

It's great effectiveness goes back 95%+ symptomatic infections, floor look like outcomes look like people get 2, 3 shots? 

Is like end similar profile annual flu common cold? really going 2 shots year beyond that? worse need keep up? point is, Pfizer really interested answer all, I'm positive research tracking efficacy different regimens time, broadly government probably inclined roll dice see 2 shot regimen holds 18 months 2 years.   raised both?

""for age 30+, 80% 30 days, ages 16-29, 48% 30 days"".

Still looking better dose 2. Yeah, saw difference countries fraction population 14 younger 6% use jab got booster jab 6 year old got first jab past weekend.

So there's 1 100.

Jab.  bad could possibly want cry hide?  Wait. We're supposed get booster? people realistic chance getting covid vaccines? 2 randomized control studies done masks. showed none little effectiveness pointed better solutions like increased air flow. noted increase benefit symptomatic  saw anything different got vaccinated?  meant people taken seriously go get booster. turn causing Covid outbreak. potential even worse winter. never-ending cycle. almost overwhelming think about. Depends community. suburb 75k people, already 87% 5 1 shot. obviously shows well 12 over, last week 84%. keep ticking us definitely 90 December. That's problem trying provide early, inconclusive data public. point, could *starting* see anything, whether plays way takes months see. Communication good, real there's reason giving preliminary data public. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* two booster doses quick succession complete waste dose.

Getting 100 mcg dose instead 50 mcg one generate bigger immune response, higher side effects - including myocarditis under-30 men. people smaller doses better.

There updated vaccines time. Hopefully we're closing finishing trials those. “Although highest risk people unvaccinated, seeing increase emergency department visits among adults 65 older, higher younger age groups,”

He goes specify 65+ they’re seeing uptick. Maybe younger people follow vaccinated later, might tired governments messaging virus itself… Thank you! Still working it, I'll get there!  know Wikipedia website says. says around 210.    excuse leave phone home, last time ever known anyone forget phone went rest day without rushing back get it?  appears significantly lower third dose (1/50,000 under-30 men) second (1/10,000). possible number incomplete, also likely myocarditis triggered inflammation multiple doses/infections quick 40% People Keeping Safe know keep safe?  Yep. breakthrough case. Insomnia massive inflammation. F covid. F fibromyalgia. F hypertension. miss fit energetic. I’m gonna go “yes, hope so” that’s country’s health authority (Netherlands) gave weeks ago. share frustration. angle if/when virus ever evolves kill anyone gets it, I’m getting boosted whatever get another day meantime, fuck shit virus. One week protection, two weeks protection others case caught first  thought joke last week, two coworkers tried stick magnet coworkers arm. dead serious. actual beds staffed beds? two different things. number can’t tell that. 

To know many hospitalizations would everyone state infected, would need know rate hospitalizations per unvaccinated case, could multiply (hypothetically fully unvaccinated) population get number. 

This number says many unvaccinated people currently hospitalized per 100k unvaccinated population. 

It doesn’t say many infected not. 

To illustrate, 88 per 100k infected currently 44 per 100k hospitalized, would mean 2.25 million would hospitalized got infected. 4,400 per 100k unvaxxed currently infected, would mean 55,000 would hospitalized, etc. 

The way number works assume 100k people currently infected. don’t mean that.  thing moderna, passed j&amp;j got moderna 10 days later. 

I know people hesitant thought could ride everyone else’s coat tails.  friend’s wife 100% like that.  whole bunch housewife MLM friends ear.  really conflicted kept wanting time make decision.  covid ripped house vaccinated husband fine got hit really hard long covid. 

She’s super skinny pretty fit too.  barely drive gets migraines around background noise large crowds. 

It pushed getting bad advice. literally one interaction away covid infection every interaction.  sure wouldn’t mess rona without vaccine protection.  Germany among lowest population immunity levels wealthy country world. cold there. always planning get booster even back said certain people needed them, going try hold till January could get PTO days back could take day recover side effects. Oh well.   too, need someone vent situation here, feel free message We've annual flu shots booster shots vaccines since invented. Stop acting like anything new extreme.  Second dose Modena me: felt like really bad head cold. Third dose Pfizer: nothing. Funny works never quantity allow 7 billion simultaneous vaccinations. way vaccine ever going end this.   ok learn new things this. vaxxed get booster. But....come on. shit working good enough. Look Ireland. High vaccination rate....but still going another COVID wave. sucks!! everyone would gotten vaccine first place it'd done deal. Even vaccine worked 100% lasted 5 years whole lot would change 35% population would refuse get keep going forever. agree.

My complaint clear. CDC clear lack communication towards public.

They suddenly change they’ve seen public information disaster Covid been. Obviously majority misinformation can’t blamed them, definitely take it.

I don’t understand don’t think little effort public education worthwhile.  Apparently put higher risk problems covid. It’s enough cripple hospital system, fullest CO ICUs whole pandemic.  US COVID impacted less well significantly more.

But could effect relative wealth, rather average absolute wealth. One bigger fears initial infection body unable fully clear virus damage left behind subsequent known / unknown infections (asymptomatic mild) causes buildup irreversible damage undetectable it’s major problem.  complain ""long time effects"" vaccine? new technology? put worries rest couple centuries? /s “History never repeats itself, often rhyme.” Covaxin? already happened US numerous times past. What’s strawman, hypothetical situation, thought experiment. Go look definition strawman.

I’m saying he’s advocating, I’m saying would say situation absurd, make point limit government even case dangerous diseases Like can’t find anything mainstream news source this, like said it’s hard evaluate actual risk you’re hearing noise people clear interest making parents anxious vaccines. Oh idea decided ok yesterday need time plan out? unique Schiphol, true flights US now. way several years. part ""enhanced"" security screening done inbound US flights. put place specifically address ""security risk"" DHS ""identified"" said bomb size laptop battery (in laptop) could virtually undetectable via traditional screening measures and, held detonated *just right place* plane (e.g., next right hydraulics electronics lines), could *in theory* bring plane. 

So 4-5 years ago implemented ""selective search"" process. ""selective search"" involves search gate including screen explosives chemical detection device meant counteract ""security risk"". 

The flagging really done computer (based arbitrary ""risk scoring"") also *super duper trained* private security personnel (hired airlines) ask questions order identify ""suspicious behavior"". reality 95%+ flags pre-ordained (e.g. flag get searched matter what) step pointless. 

I put ""enhanced"" quotes way waste people's time. know planes high value targets much softer targets go cause much public impact.  Especially close boarders EU. kinda messed maybe needed folks refuse stop spreading plague  help. corrupt doctors give ""fake"" vaccinations. take money instead giving shot arm, put drain, flower pot, etc. 

This also happening Poland. 

In cases made news investigations. 

I seriously get it. people afraid needles prefer ending hospital. 

Btw. Poland got caught woman ended hospital condition deteriorated faster would vaccinated person. One last thing patient said going ventilator, certificate faked (in way mentioned above)  fines relation income fines paid instances, example pay 100€ month ten months. joke, ""everyone else"" scared vaccinated themselves, die horribly?

The elderly sick still danger, even vaccine. cannot get vaccinated, medical reasons. please even start imply vaccine useless solve problems. fact people die horribly vaccine itself?

Yes, know. People also die chocking hotdog, happen often make complain, innit? 11,951 people counted dead Austria due covid. many due vaccine? excuses rob everyone rights

Get straight, purpose end pandemic save lives. Nobody cares much try rob precious rights. bitching rights makes sick. grew oppressive society, know like robbed rights. find antivaxers laghable, bitching ""rights"". like moaning paper cut amputee ward. trivialize suffering struggle people really fight hard rights.    anti-vaxxers propaganda.   third dose basically side effect maybe little tenderness arm following day. less side effects even first shot me. thought reports similar illness November year December realized flu. First documented case yes, first known case? Unlikely. Even somehow able trace first case wetmarket, discount virology lab may involved. 

&amp;#x200B;

This ""claim"". news agencies reporting though fact? China closing increased tension US China, could soft play US media take blame away Chinese government instead place hands nature? global health cost that's prevalent 2 years now, havent noticed, ive heard people even died. true studies show ""mixing matching"" boosters original shoot effective? (i.e first two shots modern, get pfizer booster vice versa? also got hit harder previous waves. There’s immunity prior infection countries Yep, that's personally got Moderna booster. I'm making educated guess even half-dose, going little stronger Pfizer. totally rational it, makes sense stay brand evidence switching super compelling.  Maybe simply got wrong data? got J&amp;J mid-June.  reservations go eat bar tomorrow (vaccinated) friends, along Uber Eats work tomorrow morning.  suddenly feel scared prospect getting Covid. safe next week schedule booster? cancel skip work? stressful.  went Michigan couple weeks ago funeral like everyone decided pandemic over. masks anywhere except airport, people gathering like precovid days. wearing mask, distanced, didn’t eat people, usually one wearing one. really weird people could nonchalant. mentioned reasoning narcissist.  Whoa it’s different Aus lol. still reckon follow official advice haven’t even approved one type vacc people got say Pfizer bad reaction recommended get AZ doctors aren’t allowed mix. 

Sorry didn’t realise different. Messaging inconsistent jumbled wonder people deciding don’t trust official recommendations.

Idk anymore lol. country allowed 40s start getting jab like two months ago! appear omitted lab map.

The map mark Wuhan University Center Animal Experiment. correctly located Google places much closer cluster Institute Virology, see another ""Animal Experiment Center"" difficulty mapping right place. 

I'm thinking mapped Institute Virology mapped, conducting experiments them: 

""The documents contain ... fact key experimental work humanized mice conducted biosafety level 3 lab Wuhan University Center Animal Experiment — Wuhan Institute Virology, previously assumed."" 

I allowed link source, confirmed large extent scientific paper: SFO private security still instead TSA. don’t think it’s really better. regards covid, ""minor"" ""moderate"" usually mean anything requiring immediate hospitalization. 

If get covid, fatigued breath walk across living room two weeks, lose sense smell taste six months, need hospital? Congratulations, moderate case covid.

(It's terminology would chosen, covid pandemic would chosen either.)  hear lots workers? always percent wire?  science dudes said: 70 percent vaccinated 70 percent effective vaccin free society.

90percent vaccinated 96 percent effective vaccin now.  

4th lock started

Tens Thousands kids(-12y) wearing face masks 450 people intensive care.

Fk m. aunt similar conspiracy views. got fake COVID card 😡  back April/May still smell taste fully back. enough kinda enjoy stuff nowhere B.C. Austrian here, go jail financially able pay fine, go could refuse pay. money get financial support whatever even filed bancrupt definetly go jail.

Also austria, jail people minor offenders anything serious ""light"", means normally hours sometimes even sleep home on. jail like would think US somewhere...  Multiple experts study viruses structures said coronavirus distinct effects seen viruses engineered. Yup, same. called Parosmia basically change smell. people really bad sense food smells like literal garbage rotten stuff. really bad coffee, months kinda got used taste/smell.   Antivaxxers arent reason cases rising extent moment. Winter reason cases rising moment well waning vaccine 6 months, well mutated varients. Cases fall Spring whatever vaccination rate, cases rise next winter along deaths. fact.

Human rights human rights, either not. second world war, USA locked thousands US citizens Japanese heritage many died. considered proportional precation time also. Covid passes restaurants, shops work would effect without taking away peoples right medication chose take.    Jeez people downvoting this? Reads sincere question. Outlining fears asking information. 

I mean, people want end not? WTF dissuading people joining discussion good faith perhaps (and reading along) disabused concerns based helpful, data-driven replies? 

Are 12? 69% got least one dose thats people, including children 12 cant get right now, less quarter probably Poland country equation, once. makes sense, thanks. Although don’t get it’s seized case.  ""Masks All"" website point controlled study would run severe ethical issues, hence observational studies go by.

EDIT: randomized controled studies vaccines, approved unblinded participants ""control"" group could get real shots. reached point unethical continue controlled study. Ultimately need FDA/CDC approval order sell new product.

The pharmaceuticals partner scientists FDA/CDC determine length trial results provides rigorous enough set data ensure efficacy safety.

So literally everyone board Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J, AstraZeneca, etc. conducted trials, everyone assured based results it’s safe effective age group tested.  fee that's based net worth, income? Let's hope vaccine booster reduce complications similar level seasonal respiratory virus. point event high number case problem.

Pre-covid wonder many cold virus infections happen single day, probably much higher Covid point fall/winter cold waves cause half people get sick time. Given dips we've seen warmer months, looks like it'll go way flu shot. Get vaccinated fall early winter give coverage difficult portion. Since us Americans innumerate, unvaccinated still higher rate ""breakthrough"", even covid before. shot like original ones developed Coronavirus common colds really available would better get booster every 6 months. Pfizer efficacy dropped 50% 6 months. high risk keep getting boosters every 6 months wearing mask COVID numbers high. Dunno. told they'd investigated. realize that's 90% efficacy, right? Also, antivirals treatments given post-infection clear virus disrupting virus's biochemistry. Vaccines preventative work stimulating antibody production reduce odds active infection ever occurring. understand coming from. advocate one way another, CDC guidelines get booster shot: 


here's definition underlying medical conditions: suggest read talk PCP, conversation mentioning want right thing want know getting booster shot right thing right (feel free say want get booster shot). PCP's job is, conversations patients. qualified tell one way another. hell happening? probably better full Moderna dose, half-dose still quite bit Pfizer dose. answer. Pointless. becoming superpower looks like. answerable one many depend them. plan eventually use exposure profilaxis throughput increase drastically. small molecule, shall easy. Nope.  Amen. Stop insanity.    got boosted today hoping bad second shot. Sounds like expect tomorrow crappy. got flu shot time.  Thanks, kept hearing moderna booster half dose, would better. working office since July, still pretty conservative.  Actually cases started collapsing last Januray. Let's hope repeats pattern. Thanks! time; believe they'll denied treatment vaccinated. Vax booster necessarily stop getting covid.

Only mouth-breathers think otherwise. know, ones graduated rest class despite able tie damn shoes. vaccine might saved life, least shielded worse symptoms. deep clean completley useless lol  ""You've become thing swore destroy"" Prepare every 3 months.

In Austria already book 4.

Who's lining booster every 3 months guys? show mine boss submit scanned copy. also know new hires required fully vaccinated. think new policy went effect last month got second shot Sept 10th need booster? know effective vaccines are?  That’s interesting know since got moderna beginning year haven’t gotten booster yet (not sure qualify). felt bad one day second shot. think giving expected response people would let say so. Maybe realize hurting (and people) process. ""Oh fewer people working TSA,"" said one ever. Even guy know used work TSA says TSA. makes sense, thanks reply!    guess jolts senses awake? Idk worked ppl try 🤷‍♀️. know one person worked sessions doesn’t work worst happens ate something odd.   I’m unvaccinated due heart issues, Covid August year. fever 2 days body’s aches, lost sense smell taste. Made migraines worse week. literally it, many getting sick way severely really seem.  yet. earliest would March.   Anxiety qualifies. mental health issue qualifies.   died? brother law? people? “jokes them” ? sounds pretty trashy. Might want reword Guardian virtually unreadable anymore highly suggest giving  Vaccine fading. First doses almost year ago. Get boosted!   2nd shot sucked felt almost nothing got booster.  I'm saying vaccination curb symptoms extreme, topic hand whether waning enough merit urgent push boosters. Merck Pfizer's oral treatments, start becoming available weeks, offer hope.

I'm excited vaccine rollout. kind treatment key thing looking considering fully returning normal. Get vaccinated, test quickly symptoms show up, positive get anti-viral treatment looks like good way put long covid worries bed. Deep clean what? Scientist yes, media politician sadly not.   Based I've seen, experienced, I'm still convinced boosters really needed people, think prioritized people weaker immune systems maybe benefit additional ""training"".

This unreasonable. covid rampant everywhere, yes. there's constantly people around it, completely wrong say people boost prevent mild moderate infections associated waning immunity. Long covid risk cut half, still present. know long term implications damage we're finding even mild moderate cases; long covid impact vaccinated, likely too. still knock ass week; privileged assume everyone miss work long without problem severe enough warrant boosters. also unpleasant worth avoiding there's serious downside boosters. spread? There's valid reasons control spread allowing boosters; especially people living vulnerable individuals.

Yours kind thinking people panel, frankly find repugnant.  still are!

Though, shots first came LTCFs, everyone thought “Finally shots end pandemic! Back normal! Victory!” BS happened anti vaxxers, delta, waning immunity, etc. anti-climatic. 

But prevail!  Maybe. information mine mostly hand written doctor. imagine would least little difficult create believable fake based similar cards.

But also, case, submit copy mine varification would boss confirming show valid proof. employer agree vaccination would say ""see"" proof vaccination anyone want get shot.  debating trying Moderna see swelling Pfizer related. r/StreetEpistemology goo way get people method. SE instead trying convince particular point view simply set aside judgement personal beliefs ask calm friendly questions get root causing believe, ask questions test reliable way reach true conclusions. basically guided critical thinking. effective done correctly, though important go mindset changing mind, ruin session way.  Harder lie hospital it’s part medical records access them. work, friends, etc sure lie. Fauci honest good, opening door hoarde braindead idiots come nonsense refute with.

He needs firm.on language. uptick slight, overall vaccinated folk leagues safer severe covid compared unvaccinated. even close.  ever going end :(    Yes, approved ago.  mom insists get hurt accident wearing seatbelt, flat refuses wear one now. People strange.  would antibodies disappear *faster* boosters?

We every reason believe they'll fade, they're far higher levels therefore take much longer fade. we'll slightly fewer Thousands Standing Around? horror. Hopefully vaccines atleast keep hospital.

My Fully vaccinated Uncle got COVID work. wife, mother grandmother too. Fully vaccinated booster.

So far everyone okayish home. one I'm really worried 83 year old grandmother far okay.   Exactly. That's position parents younger kids know. actual Yeah lot countries idioms it, long understand seems kinda fun...   Yes. Absolutist statements like ""the vaccine effective someone got sick died"" hallmark radicalism/the misinformed.

""When someone unwilling necessary knowledge accumulation required move past simplistic understanding chosen belief model, may become dogmatic absolute beliefs.

The reason happens related Dunning-Kruger effect, where people limited competence subjects tend overconfidence knowledge because don’t know enough understand breadth fallibility.

Thus, lack knowledge leads overconfidence simplistic belief models result extremist thinking.  Imagine virus 80%+ mortality Ebola strains, otherwise behaves like covid. Contagious days symptoms, completely asymptomatic spreaders, aerosol spread, wildly contagious...

We'd *fucked*. Eventually, something like coming. Hopefully far enough future we've perfected rapid vaccine deployment... anytime soon... we're *fucked*. Civilization know would probably collapse.  That's bullshit! got booster 2 weeks ago I'm getting peacock. Kids ending hospital though yet hospitalisations ICU numbers still rising fast, single death 12 age group entire pandemic.   Yes don’t expect spike dramatic - least Portugal ( close 98% adults vaccinated).
Greece example weather patterns seeing massive spike due lowest vaccination rate western EU    ever say mix match vaccines? Got j&amp;j back March want something different booster  even worse that, we're 90% total eligible population stat brought mostly 12-25 year olds. 

Something like 98% 60's vaccinated know make vast majority hospitalisations yet tiny group make 57% people ICU  be. It’s two years boosters. able travel see family please. here. Moderna think lot parents also honestly want wait see. like people wanted drag never get vaccinated. lot parents vaccinated choice want give couple months make sure unexpected adverse effects.   comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

169.3 per 100k unvaccinated forever boggle mind people received vaccines fine, threaten people legal action order take it. people hard time taking particular vaccine? can't political, it? mean jesus fucking christ lets get rid disease already.  mean hating idiots prolonging escalating pandemic wrong? completely stop transmission, vaccinated people much lesser symptoms less likely spread it.

Vaccines miracle 100% protection, they're giant fucking step right direction read speculations may 3500€ one time payment Anecdote: friend (mid twenties) got booster said 3rd actually better her. Still gross, worse.  Austria lot intensive care beds, 2020 second intensive care beds per capita OECD even corona Austria criticized waste public funds amount spent hospital beds.

What recommendations politicians? Read please. apparently people super uncomfortable flailing im triple vaccinated statements. response, someone decided respond “ oh thank god, HIV/AIDS. Im glad put full trust well hands”

Magically anti-masker/anti-vaxxer decided put mask.

So person decided show brutal risky covid be. state 50% people fully vaccinated 60% one dose. see terrifying numbers are.

Play coin flip see dont catch covid, play gamble life get destroyed, die, long term effects.

All depending someone elses choices yours.

Stay safe remember, wouldnt gamble 50/50 make another person  Oh definitely, agree. believe Thanksgiving holiday travel would preferred going holiday Dec/Jan good too, winter surge would apex. Except 2 regions ours, lockdown December 17th that's already set stone. 10+10 days whole country. vaccination stops people getting too, 100% guaranteed. Fines prison comply. got Moderna. data showing going J&amp;J booster would helpful? I'm guessing Pfizer similar Moderna helpful, lower dose too. Yeah me, asked 6 months verbally asked confirm qualified. did, hard evidence asked for. Important note, Americans may aware it: unvaccinated Austrians *already* locked sorts public facilities (restaurants, bars, theatres, cinemas, gyms etc.). need proof vaccination enter those, like European countries. final step force vaccination remove refuse society. guessed wrong Getting downvoted ridiculous, yes wave winter already starting. bad worse last winter, way tell. 

I bet everyone dropping guard it’s going ruff, vaccinated fair far better un-vaccinated. Latin america's death count would certainly go notion.  September weekly mortality report provides information deaths registered almost real-time National Population Register. used determine actual number deaths occurred country calculate number excess deaths numbers would expected historical mortality trends COVID-19 pandemic South Africa May 2020 early September 2021, quarter million people died natural causes predicted time vast majority – three quarters – age 60.

I’m really hoping don’t use cases like toss Jacobson v. Massachusetts together respect point view. Honestly do. still reads dont consent get vaccine cant afford pay fine go jail. FDA declined boosters everyone Biden came ahead time said everyone would able get booster.

Now behind boosters huge national holiday. One lead thousands people getting sick people dying. 

All upset Biden Iceland surge cause overload hospital high case number? even vaccine protection infection reduce time still keeping people hospital like seasonal respiratory virus. really comparing lockdown home jail?  report what? walgreens corporate suppose?

Since can’t legally „force“ ppl receive vacc try way Yes, COVID pass enough unfortunately. we're I'd gone dancing yesterday night instead playing videogames millionth time pandemic Netherlands partial lockdown again. Well right gone dancing I've got common cold staying home, get point.

I certainly impression eliminate COVID vaccinating everyone twice. Even though yet official policy Netherlands fully expect receive booster next spring. elderly people comorbidities/ immune system diseases probably need yearly maybe even halfyearly booster foreseeable future. Although judge still whether 3rd shot provide durable immunity, least healthy, younger part population. Maybe 3rd shot last one time being. sufficient vaccination **does** however (and proven beyond doubt) massively reduce chance hospitalization death. Even vaccine effectiveness vulnerable cohorts (elderly people comorbidities) starting wane. vaccinate, open society remain strain healthcare system lower, even autumn winter.

So yes, way get less normally functioning society back get 90+% fully vaccinated one way another, whether ""fully vaccinated"" means 2 3 shots (for still 2 received second shot end july) point. 3rd shot?  Im sorry didnt think replying you? Oh yes right, wasnt replying you. replying someone throwing around word irony without even knowing meaning word. 

No problem, would explain goofed reply.  right mind would rather get covid disease vaccine. Absolutely mind boggling.  German Christmas markets outdoors. There's never outdoor superspreader event COVID spreads outdoors rate 1000x lower indoors. explanation make sense. claim know within 2 weeks whether vaccine safe not. think bullshit whatever.

If indeed case, however, provisional approvals given?

""This vaccine safe take efficacy still determined"" - article talks dilemma ethically giving vaccine placebo group receives emergency approval ability maintain control group study **long term effectiveness safety.**

If know vaccine safe within 2 weeks, Nature one ""those people"" worry negative longer term impacts

Here's another article talking Phase III trials use determining efficacy like said, 2 weeks claim bullshit hate lockdown coming partner going earn money anymore. finished paying debts again. totally understand why. 

In parts already moving important cancer operations could mean death people hospitals leave death patients hallway enough workers take care anymore. people went jail germany didnt pay GEZ  Unfortunately viruses care much promises forecasts scientists politicians. Things change either accept adjust consequences pretend exist face something worse. Facing fears way conquering them. sayin. would hope also concerned getting Covid passing vulnerable people might die end debilitated Long Covid.

Because lost mine abroad dealing father's death cremation I've stuck Canada month one give answer get new card fly back home. I'm US citizen ya. fuck that? honest, ""western"" relative Greece ever since 13 years ago.

But besides that, know many people went Portugal lately, exactly safe destination. also look winters north: cold humid less sunshine wind, although less cold side Atlantic, conditions feel much worse gives much incentive Rona roam around. Except kid already covid, recently that, point making entirely moot family.

Additionally, kids actually recover fine, despite lot headlines seem pushing, significantly reducing actual benefit vaccine age group (not say benefit all; certainly is). immediate risk substantially lower children. know longterm consequences covid, think parents hesitant unreasonable either. parents waiting see data making binary choice either: vaccinated people still get covid (I sure did), waiting bit data mean child get covid period. Things already getting bad. 14 day average cases US 30%. Fortunately vaccines booster enough help people find degree normalcy definitely last year. greatly appreciate time took write message make valid points. counter argue controlling unvaccinated covid passes stopping indoor interactions well making vaccinations mandatory jobs job without taking away medical consent. also drastically reduce hospitalisation unvaccinated. Hospitalisation vacinated one realised beginning 2021 vaccine starts waning 6 months. 3rd booster now. illusion still catch covid pass countless people. Both. correct.  Maybe. yet cold (Lisbon), but, know rest Europe, masks still mandatory almost everywhere indoors public transportations still respect that. course still morons almost two years still know cover nose mouth, small minority. Yes, that's bad enough. Let's add more.  read pfizer merck's covid antiviral pills BS think are. BS, sense work, sense journalists saying help 'end pandemic'.

these pills seem good avoid hospitalizations. main goal keep unvaccinated high risk people hospital start experiencing covid symptoms (mild moderate). however, USA (and many others) still fixated case counts rather hospitalizations. understanding pills reduce spread/transmission.

what we're still missing treatment option, pill form, individual ends hospital (severe covid). something easy administer. rigel's fostamatinib ahead game.
