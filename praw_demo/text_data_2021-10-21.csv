0,2021-10-21," Damn matriarchy Japan South Korea also public health experts understand respiratory illness. knew Covid airborne day 1, MERS found airborne. South Korea even already recommended respirators general population MERS respiratory illness prevention, abundance Chinese yellow sand storms hit Korea. Japan effectively using ventilation, air purification, masks, humidifiers years prevent influenza among elderly.

Japan contact tracing detective units ready go, South Korea high tech contact tracing apps. 

It's story Western incompetence anything else. cannot effectively communicate audience, good communicator. make sense cases going specifically thanks things like masks vaccines? literally see effects vaccines masks time case charts, see efficacy vaccines hospitalization death rates. It’s like somehow factors become divorced reality. Reddit comments, health officials. randos online prefer masks, let wear masks. doesn’t hurt you. doubly sad wishing hoax lowering brother ground that’s want do, bother you? number people isn’t majority, folks want common sense protections plans outbreaks. seems like genuinely traumatizing dangerous, tend spotlight extreme voices views. Like check people downvoting realistic current trajectory we’re seeing. reality, things looking better realistically won’t living like forever. Idk are, city still masking businesses like bars restaurants asking vaccine cards, we’re otherwise behaving pretty normally transmission low. That’s thanks near 80% vaccine rate. seems like States focused racial statistics compared countries. DAT.. Good you! *friends* like ... Tick Tock men generally unhealthy lifestyles. Plus usually way heart issues Covid really bad normalized extent people wear sick outside poor air quality, wearing masks constantly. That’s opposite way Apple’s products trending. could argue many Apple’s products overpriced many years ago, it’s much difficult make argument now. Beats 1 453 (and counting) fellow countrymen choking death bodily fluids, hospitals overwhelmed point many die. guy never played video game final final boss first final boss.  I'm sure love waiting around 10 weeks lockdown go least 5 weeks waiting antivaxxers get vaxxed hope day might allowed use friend's shitter.  It’s already endemic. point comes keeping boosters staying aware infection clusters. don’t know 0 Covid possible, widely available vaccines new treatments horizon, might become like really ugly flu strains see every often. It’s they’re dangerous vulnerable populations, rather we’ve learned manage better protect ourselves. ""a study National Cancer Institute (INT) Italian city Milan shows, signaling might spread beyond China earlier thought.""

First sentence article. So, still came China, earlier thought. evidence points virus spreading WAY earlier Nov/Dec 2019 China stopping (basically pushing rug thinking would go away).

Common sense says China blame would simply allowed fully investigate. brain surgery folks.  point, seem incentive make vaccine effective longer. keep people coming back every 6 months, turn cash cow. private info. Info don’t need know. people vaxx still capable spreading too. science. 

Thank god don’t live. Way much overreach. I’m carrying card me. would get damaged. come saying take picture people use pictures others cards. Oh course never actually happen... least government-imposed way. certainly see happening culturally certain regions .. like masking culturally normalized Japan long time now. Agreed. would also argue plenty businesses refuse adapt and/or provide profitable good service. COVID didn’t kill businesses; sped inevitable fate. know many parents waiting, nice thing is, places don’t need kids vaccinated reach herd immunity least hospitals back feet again. feeling metrics we’ll using, especially faculty staff vaccinations rolling along well. San Francisco need show vaccine card get takeout, far know.

I think good rule help decrease risk getting covid restaurant. think vaccination status private info. coming lab exclude earlier bat origin? cpuld studying bat coronaviruses  big drinker, no. shit. Kids still can’t get vaccinated communication problem. people communicating to. mean 2023?  favorite part that’s already happening they’re calling drug conspiracy they’re calling “big pharma” wanting take advantage us pushing “experimental” drug us plenty “proven” therapies like ivermectin. 

Common sense would point ivermectin new drug manufactured Merck. Merck publicly stated ivermectin effective part therapy covid (prevention vs treatment).

I shouldn’t surprised phenomenon since contradiction irony common themes Didn’t waste time assuming conspiracy stuff. It’s attitude turns lot people off. It’s ok uncomfortable endless shots. I’m questioning anything, I’m saying I’m excited hate needles. Liberals republicans insane drink much koolaid regardless it’s red blue.  First, I'm pro vax, I'm say may seem like I'm not.

Apple also discriminate medically immunocompromised *cannot* currently get vaccine. Cancer patients getting chemo, example.

It would horrifying lose job *and* medical insurance.

Daily testing protects (and coworkers) still ensuring workplace safe.

[Also note federal guidelines allow employee accommodation, see p. 5, point Like monoclonal antibodies, pill effective taken early course infection.

It much benefit covidiots stay denial come ER can't breathe. got Moderna full dose Monday.... JJ Apr 5 hrs fever sore arm still hit gym .....chills day two vomit another fever ....3 hrs good new may sterling scientific career, disagree. I’d say he’s terrible communicator hasn’t stayed away dipping hand in, least going along with, politics. tell noble lies American people good make montages longer effective communicator noone right mind trust anymore. dude needs resign disgrace. approval adults only. Due supply limits, first available elderly people high-risk medical conditions. No, know exactly define ""high risk"" purpose. husband also Chinese immigrant planning visit family May 2020. first saw report unknown illness China right (like 1-2 days) Christmas 2019 watching anxiously see needed cancel trip. never imagined would become.   COVID sexist.   That’s angriest yawn I’ve ever seen. Pretty sure answer is, ""Nobody knows yet.""

But data's coming time.  among vaccinated people.   relief daily average cases deaths Brazil 15k 400 days respectfully, considering country vaccinated population 70% first dose, 50% second dose.
And everything goes well, I'll able get second dose tomorrow :D Well behind paywall, can't see, can't comment it. here' article CNN September 1, basically absolute peak covid cases, says 5 states less 10% ICU beds let. would mean peak, 45 states less 10% ICU beds left, even worst, run beds. Keep mind, stupid way healthcare run, majority beds used even non covid times, covid making minority beds. Also, case rates less half keep following. argument limited beds covid limited argument can't made everywhere.    Maybe I'm misunderstanding you. reason think Pfizer booster effective Moderna booster? Correct, prefer create orphans thru forced labor “re-education” camps. lol definitely. three days alone US average 1600 deaths. would reduce 90%. think daily average goes 250, means almost there.

If look chart close July fucking Delta Variant messed everything up. Don’t think crosses line? need show private personal info get food somewhere? rule applied takeout orders well. 

This stupid realistic. Increased transmissibility still concern. thought dominant strain super transmissible keeps increasing. NIH study heterologous boosting test J&amp;J first dose half-dose Moderna full dose? hope ""if Moderna J&amp;J recommend booster, something, take pick including original"". already advised basically behave vaccine anyway regard social distancing masks. vaccine take precautions get high viral load die. opposed Covid silently bowing New Year's Eve? one expecting Irish Goodbye. people test positive die 28 days later? many those. wish could someone like President US. Unfortunately, she'd lose landslide, country depraved. side note, read somewhere personally called families 28 New Zealanders died COVID. true? coming day nightclubs reopen! already have. feels good No, cases increasing equally among age groups. Interesting. know it’s basically crap shoot symptoms, I’m hoping bit better third it’s finally available, lol safe effective vaccine protects smoking drug use?


Until vaccine exists, comparison doesn’t work. Ahh, gotcha. Stay well! still give 100ug shot immunocompromised patients?

Then much? Come on. mean, great, sure, tell family friend fighting life ICU right despite double vaccinated. believe stats, sucks know people 10% despite everything right. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

That super duper incorrect, even today, weeks delta started whole country, start scrolling try find first hospital available ICU beds. third way down, covers dozens states. halfway they're still 99% capacity use, 1 &lt;1 ICU bed available.

Count lucky area never hit hard. hospitals telling people go urgent care orthopedic doctors everything possible people dying treatable causes waiting ICU beds. Around 7,500 Americans die every day. Put global scale it’s incomprehensible.  arent premixed that?

CDC literally become joke span like 6-8 months. little respect anymore. lol isnt flu? every illness isn’t another illness yet still compare, arent openly questioning multi dose vaccines? tetanus shots require endless boosters? conspiracy??? fauci ? bill gates? gay frogs? felt fine first second, booster felt like hangover morning late afternoon felt fine. Don’t worry, children save us. adults selfish get jab watch children get order attend schools demanded reopened they’ll explain get shot parents don’t. likely, they’ll probably lie say did. pandemic end soon enough, plenty people sat sidelines didn’t part, forced children take care them. Shame. family sadly ......they say oh making covid ....despite getting nearly killing brother .....he (COPD) still pull downplay like flu.   Got J&amp;J mid June Moderna booster beginning October. first shot morning. Nothing went bed evening: Started shivering ~ two hours symptoms, even headache. sweating body got rid excess heat. Super weird. 
After second shot weak headache mild fever next day. Even weaker symptoms day that. unpleasant, even worth calling sick for. 
Mind you, one single datapoint. seems least two-shot mRNA regimen peoples reactions place. There’s indication afaik combination different. Even 99.7% 18+ people vaccinated, still probably 10-15% &lt;12yos, unvaccinated. could half cases 15% population unvaccinated, example. CDC enacts advisory committee recommended, likely able get either mRNA booster another dose J&amp;J, probably time next week.  “This isn’t flu”. Again, agree disagree “not big deal”. specifically said laminate cards get-go? arguing, saying. one 6 weeks ago. say nose sore 2-3 days after. guess I'm aggressive nurses previous tests. vaccines available all, mandates dropped. don’t wear masks protect us Mumps Polio. shit vaccines. Right I’m mandates protect children. proven safe all. live new normal. kids vaccines approved (presumably soon), cares? happens practically every ""new"" program Oregon (including upgrades). CareOregon website (Medicaid ACA) famous example, seriously seems like every time.

I think *relatively* confident incompetence malice. Oh dumbass says it. 

What happen ""we celebrating far we've come"" whatever BS saying things started opening up. asked flat kids can't get shot dodged question. bunch idiot parents thinking know science idiot said Bleach cures covid. I'm J&amp;J toilet research thusfar lead believe boosting J&amp;J Modena best outcome (at least items antibodies) that's scheduled weekend.

My husband 2 Moderna shots takes immunocompromising medication he's going third Moderna, also weekend. I'm sure he's getting official booster dose full third shot, though. 

It's looking like Pfizer going ok'd 5-11s 5s first rate, that's we'll probably end going 4 7 year old. 

So we'll pretty mixed vaccine family end. I'm sure much really matters, pretty much went whatever approved cohort available first. I'm sure Covid becomes endemic lot changes boosters done types paired, etc. want updated antibodies us kids protection all. I'll probably care nitty gritty details more, even matter much point.  Moderna's booster half-sized, at: 50mg.   think All. The. Waste. generate. Apple, employers well. 

These people allegedly willing _die_ get economy going last year vaccine. 

They _incomprehensible_. true all.   meant wouldn’t taxed pay people’s healthcare hell I’d sign form even though I’m fully vaccinated

But pay anyway I’m sure hell going use system small chance get seriously ill [Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* *looks* like boosters approved, along mixing matching - per [CDC's recent news could still well wrong, processes decisions go confusing. Could levels get through? CDC director signing Moderna boosters seemed final step last time around.

ETA: local Walgreens boosters running types - though looks like mixing matching one direction? in, get different booster J&amp;J. look Moderna, get Moderna booster. Except exceptions.   believe Modena dose 100 (whatever units use?) vs Pfizer's 30. half Moderna still almost twice full Pfizer!  understand 90% population vaccinated, infection among group higher unvaccinated 10%, even 90% getting infected lower rate.

They can't process ratio.

I explain many times times get downvoted.

All see ""100 vaccinated infected"" care see 50 unvaxxed infected, even though make much smaller group. would grounds least getting company work try figure reasonable accommodation Covid Vaccine rejection actual medical condition. company would grounds ask documentation medical provider evidence that. reasonable expectation probably would come needing submit regular testing (as Apple here), masking times.


These kind exemptions could easily dealt truly medical need avoid vaccination looking exemption, much larger group assholes scientific medical reason go get vaccinated matter hours. Noooo men bad H1N1? 1 ICU quote, that’s 1:40,000, easy digest 1 10 hospital . Nothing extraordinary either  good do, honestly?  would also suggest vaccine magic shield keeps viruses 6 feet away. Presumably exposure, 'have Covid' body fights off.  vaccinated (and unvaccinated people course) people exposed 'have Covid' amount time - whether period time long enough produce positive test know. So, switching Pfizer would getting lower dose. 

IIRC, Moderna booster half dose, Pfizer full dose, boosters least probably similar dosing. Unsure really mentioned ""COVID camp"" thing CDC came TikTok. gotta investigate anything sounds outlandish eyebrow raising. There's way US would allow COVID ""concentration camps."" Yeah I’m curious too. issue author failed point Florida’s 7 day average COVID related death 187/day. number crazy, 1309 people passed away COVID-19 7 days Florida. least numbers get Florida. sith deals absolutes clinical trials test effectiveness infection; tested effectiveness symptomatic covid (I believe needed show two symptoms getting PCR test pfizer moderna; one symptom AZ).  test negative stuff definitely good requirement death rate really key piece information.  American assholes: ""The virus made CCP.""
Chinese assholes: ""The virus made USA.""
With great power comes great asshole. Thanks details. People cant accept vaccines good enough end No, ones unnecessary also ridiculous expectation. end day everything life small risks. Asking low paid workers check vaccination cards unnecessary burden likely cause problems resolve. restaurant WANTS enforce 100% fine me, forced to. one forcing anyone go makes feel uncomfortable they're checking stick places are. know people need make issue complicated already is.  Thanks links. true things took hit things broke June July. expected much, shutdown biggest attractions month. However, take perspective world middle pandemic country shut-down foreign tourism, industry quite well China. 1 4000 ICU actually pretty high. city couple million hundred ICU beds.  I'm fence getting booster...

I'm mid 30's, overweight, smoking, comorbidities, pretty active athletic. Healthy ox.

However, mid-november I'm going flying pretty crowded area, 2 young kids home aproved vaccination.

Got Moderna early March // early april (shots 1//2)

Would it? lot people die every day...and mostly idiots point good them. Rite Aid still showing “Oops! time, CDC recommending one dose Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.” real, got mine Saturday pissed sick day Sunday lol.   Unfortunately pandemic I’ve learned majority people follow common sense actually protects not. 

Meaning people followed guidelines got vaccinated caused virus spread much much less. slowing spread prevented even worse hospital capacity flow. means still adequate medical treatment heed warnings ended hospital. 

So basically stupid saved majority smart people lol makes sense general modern societies let nature take course. 

And clear I’m saying people shouldn’t smart rather pointing interesting observation Nope, got 6 weeks sharp first second Pfizer shot.  Sweden stuck 7 week first second shot sence start vaccination. That's complete lie. came Australian Lobsters, ones tainted Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison demanded China submitted investigation origins Covid-19 Wuhan started trade war China Australia.

How otherwise? Winnie Pooh, 50 cents? Oh come on. usually much needed rational voice I'm sure enthusiasm boosters clouding judgment what, misleading. 

It's clear responding thread talking rates young males whether problematic, responding calculations rates 16-59 across genders young male rates next slide source contribute discussion. article also say counties Ireland lowered Covid rate, I'd interested know vaccination rate, could compare county.  Ohh idk , maybe half population vaccinated another 40 plus million infected study study shown provide immunity. perfect, ofcourse definitely better facing time last year. Idk I’m going guess science? Math?  Maybe hung horse? Going 30 hours far Pfizer booster April JJ. slight side effects body ache headache comes goes. subtle. literally agreed second paragraph. Last saw trial supposed start August.

Doing searches right bring recent news regular booster sure that's at.   blood plasma antibodies go away, expected. Memory B-cells retain antibodies though, matching antigen presents begin reproduce create plasma cells secrete plasma antibodies again. know else unwise froth?  bring back Hancock? clarify say anymore vaccinated believe vaccines decrease illness think it’s crazy say otherwise agree sans last sentence. seem achieving goal wanted. 

Considering population 50k stretching even fourth population covid means 1/1250 get hospitalized vaccinated. also one small city. 

It may simply (definitely) anomaly rest world reporting that, obviously predicted, people vaccinated less likely die admitted hospital. 

So yes specific case seems working well intended to. anomaly average. wouldn’t say opposite goal rest worlds findings city 0% vaccination rate would far hospitalizations 10. Oh wow could ever guessed so, clickbait. Exactly, go door door to. true, actually false published Twitter let nature take course stopped reporting it, that's all.     Partially good, second option made available.   small percentage people existing vaccines little provide antibodies incapable vaccinated. boosters available people 65 immunocompromised. Unless wearing skin tight N95, mask probably whole lot stop delta variant, would much protect you. 

Also understand, vaccinated covid, lower chance dying dying flu, quote that. Vaccinations covid slowed dumb political reasons, general distrust anything asked citizens government. consider, behavior toward flu? mandate masks stop flu, disease also kills old vulnerable? point calculate risk vs personal freedom peering shoulders, shorting lives living constant fear. metrics use point focused hospitalization deaths, cases, especially counter medicines finally reduce covid symptoms. True, huge number get it. Maybe enough get us herd immunity sure bring us much closer. bit much though think, no? Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

To describe article anti-vax pretty jarring misrepresentation misunderstanding it.

The article interesting piece looking immune system evolves time covid vaccination.

I'd strongly recommend readers, read actual article rather rely descriptions provided somebody narrative push. shoot them, faster.  According articles tourism revenue golden week holidays remain 2019, stable compared 2020. perhaps new normal Chinese tourism industry pandemic resolves years line. willing sacrifice certain amount tourism dollars lives saved, perhaps conclude depressed tourism sector worthy trade mostly undisrupted manufacturing sector.

As well western tourism sector recovered better, sources showing data that? quick google search came [this regarding Spain continuing struggle due low foreign tourist travel. Spain may fewer travel restrictions now, China articles suggest domestic travel alone keep tourism sector 60-70% prepandemic levels. Spain still 26% prepandemic level terms foreign travelers. Spain's domestic tourists make gap better China's domestic tourists?  0.4% population died places even half got infected there.   I'm sure live, restrictions minimal live persist. think response poor best public health departments embarrassment. say certainty actually live pandemic, would rather died first wave. proud nothing health departments proud people living chose comply restrictions clearly unnecessary.

It's hard businesses. Children missed 18 months school, hard too. pain continues terms needless mask mandates society fears covid. 

Given last pandemic century ago, would hoped could better response time. Unfortunately, didn't. Holy shit, *SURGEON GENERAL* telling people vaccines work?? awful. efficacy vaccines, Ladapo added, ""So sure reduce likelihood transmission, even sort questionable depending far go, they're preventing says science back vaccine mandates work, ""in fact science says something completely opposite.""

Like, said reduces transition. *is*preventing it?...And I'd love see ""science"" proving opposite vaccine mandates working. YIKES. hoax, meaning still alive? another cause death? Sorry get I'm immunocompromised got 3rd shot 2 months ago, go run get 4th shot since 1st shot 6 months ago? 1 spreads other, dead. Yeah, real hard understand! 87% eligible adults fully vaccinated Ontario, everyone continues wear mask public, schools, kids vaccinated hospitals still dealing busy ICU's.

I _need_ vaccine roll amongst kiddos stop worrying 2 smaller ones becoming hospitalized this. They're far current age brackets, care silly rules follow (And kids, rules silly, what's one more? re, masks). need guys approve Nov 3rd 12 shots kthxbaaaaai People traumatized they're denial, normal times we're in, akin dark ages almost seems. Wait. You’ve actually heard medical professionals say “black people feel less pain?” hard time believing could graduate medical school thinking. Air China speaks investors believe China *may* ease border restrictions 2024, definitely Winter Olympics. someone asks covid vaccine card picture?  worry, ""doing research."" Oh no!!! sorry &amp; feel better soon vibes. sucks. Keep one unless good reason change. people means choosing mRNA vaccine J&amp;J. absolute contra-indication vaccine prior allergic reaction one ingredients. Since J&amp;J shares non ingredients vaccines, leaves probably less 300 people (@ 1 1,000,000) entire US.

There reasons postpone people might currently receiving certain types chemo / radiation, immune suppressing drugs. said people around people either. Stop thinking get Moderna booster. reason consider otherwise myocarditis 2nd Moderna dose. data suggest boosting J&amp;J may improve outcome.  


This problem approving booster without guidance. It’s easy people choose something based misunderstanding lack understanding. know people insist vaccinated getting covid unvaxxed. “The vaccinated ones getting spreading covid.” misinformation lack understanding information purposely skewing frustrating, keeps spreading. People become divided opinions like this, can’t convince otherwise matter say.

Might help add I’m US vaccination rates aren’t high city article. people cold?

Why *wouldn't* cold? think anyone died.

If someone believes deaths hoaxes, feel need sensitive, instead outraged claim everything emotional blackmail. feel you’re prepared go get booster test positive

Hoping mild course like it’s far really frustrated cares? Unpaid? losing income can't get vaccine legit reason? That's reasonable me. 

I'm taking medical exceptions here, people claim religious exception cause mah freedoms I’m 7 hours thing I’m feeling minor arm soreness. Definitely bad first shot felt like arm going fall off, it’s still early expect get worse morning.

But far experience much similar second shot! fatigue nausea anything yet like first dose. feel bad people legitimately can't get vaccine medical reasons, like family members autoimmune diseases. life impacted much rest us terrified COVID. nipping COVID early forcing people like go back intense quarantine, extremely inconvenienced work provide easy free testing looks like CVS working now. Can’t make appointments get page saying they’re adding appointments. got mine week ago cvs. Moderna. literally walked in, asked, got flu shot. gave full dose, questions asked. That’s pretty senile. Alzheimer’s? Maybe position make logical decisions know someone scared getting vaccine, well, vaccine covid-19 one. works therapist hopefully one day able overcome fear get vaccines needs stay healthy. fears adamant wearing masks, wearing gloves, bleaching everything, using disinfectant social distancing. health people around her.

I know lady scared needles can't get vaccine. Actually gets shots whatsoever! fastidious masks, wearing gloves, washing hands, touching face, disinfectant use social distancing comes public couple times month. works home keeps people well. says other's good health!

I know couple people doctor diagnosed allergies advised take vaccine. two people know cautious around people. take precautions careful wearing masks, disinfectant use social distancing. One guy frustrated going covid-19 vaccine, social distancing, businesses impacted regulations ""want with!""

So everyone can't get vaccine reckless behaviors. Yup, people get vaccine, whatever reasons, go lives impervious virus! Obviously seeing results behaviors. people getting vaccine see people reckless! Life perfect sure try best can. 

So let's keep putting message there: get vaccine, wear face mask, wash hands, touch face social distance! get vote! this!  honest, could 5x worse  really need talking exit strategy rather doubling restrictions rules.

I agree, lets pretend angry lockdown-forever nuts restrictions rules *are* point.  locker rooms benches (with extremely heavy breathing) there's really ability social distance. may better environment respiratory virus spread.   fine  adds questioning boosters. don’t defined metrics this, don’t even defined antibody titer sufficient. That's thing. 1/1000 relative prevalence 15% higher growth rate per 5 days take 250 days catch Delta.

This like previous jumps +25% +50% even higher much smaller jump, we're seeing coming advance (hopefully). Hope antivaxx rumor mongers proud themselves. care something 1st amendment, lol.

The lawmakers decide what's legal not, independently religion.

It's frankly absurd religion exempts obligation like vaccine mandate. Yes, even care ""freedom"". medical exemptions needed they're meant protect person damage risk get medical treatment (although extremely rare case COVID vaccines) What're going do? Bomb Bangor? I’m also lucky enough position, though attribute great labor market right anything. case, restrictions really mostly masks outdoor dining/delivery services, fact we’re among lowest number deaths country speaks success pretty minimal restrictions. I’m proud way we’ve come together support small businesses make sacrifices protect vulnerable. 

That said, it’s undeniably hard business people, often feels like we’re left limbo want better thing do. Communication really slow, that’s really hurt schools, businesses, etc. We’re also lucky enough access tons beautiful nature, that’s something everyone gets. 

Unfortunately seems like basically way we’ve historically always reacted pandemics species (chaos, tribalism, patchwork things work, etc) maybe it’s flaw species LOL. least know get it. think decision kids Yes, let's blame people dying, ignore fact known sex mammalian immune responses. Let's also ignore fact we've since beginning pandemic significant correlation oestrogen levels resistance severe covid. One highest, sure.

[But, reference, here's relevant page patients stem cell transplant received CAR T-cell therapy, typically receiving immunosuppressive therapy, recommend delay COVID-19 vaccination least 3 months they’ve completed treatment. That’s based data [other] vaccines limited efficacy periods patients data little less clear patients getting aggressive chemotherapy, receiving intensive treatment regimens—for example, starting initial therapy leukemia—we recommend delay vaccination cell counts recover.

Oh asked question &amp; got got downvoted, least got answer got Thank you! gives shit waited August? got vaccine. Get it. hyper aggressive attitude Redditors towards jump first opportunity get vaccine really off-putting quite frankly, really immature.

Hyper aggressive attitude? asked waited August 22nd &amp; completed getting vaccinated.

I sorry sensitive asking simple question results calling hyper aggressive redditor asking.

I tried give benefit doubt &amp; asked fully vaccinated October 20th, point response giving anti vax tag, sorry ever asked anything, made position *very clear*. guidance came tonight (I'm pretty sure - kind hard tell decisions whole process). Mix match option, though think recommending stick initial one unless good reason switch.

Pfizer Moderna basically vaccine, except different quantities (the efficacy differences resulting longer gap doses Moderna). So, switching Pfizer would getting lowe dose. Unless avoiding intense side effects goal, Johnson Johnson would option want ""different"" buffer protection via adenovirus. Moderna, however, seems offer protection three. So, depends goal booster. politicians.. fucking MTG piece shit Nah, came Nexus Sominous.

Pre-covid, millions singles hook every week. catch disease.  even comparing two wildly different timeframes concerns total cases vaccination rate aside trying confirm biases?

Sorry, explicit. point June thought unvaccinated people engaging mitigations (e.g. getting vaccinated) due danger COVID-19, would inconsistent believe vaccinated people engaging mitigations now. [CDC data shows somehow lower hospitalization rate vaccinated people currently, may vary based wave continues falling[...]

That sounds perfectly reasonable me. wave actually fall first. current trend looks promising, hopefully continue.  Moderna booster 1/2 dose EVERYONE. Except immunocompromised, get full dose.  case 6 month wait duration needed well. Third short reserved immunocompromised.

Booster anyone 65+, people high risk medical condition.
People high risk occupational institutional situations 18-64 may also eligible taking accounts risk/reward. 

But really wanted get despite categories… could get you’re willing get shot. Makes sense. Thanks. I've pretty long time us jobs bartending, theatre, wear mask detrimental rehearsals, receiving tips. I'll first line. feel like moral imperitive help greater good. seems like completely meaningless clickbait headline. percentage that? high past week? feel way health safety rules workplace? illegal threaten harass. broad that's courts for. leap also prevent misinformation could lead harm?

I want get weeds ""Why that"". Take qualified constitutional law expert, not. Definitely real concern well. vaccinated people still almost always surviving avoiding hospitalization even delta. get 3rd Moderna shot tomorrow, I'm going flight/vacation Tuesday - getting benefit take 2 weeks even kick in? Good? get mean, embarrassed vaccine mix-and-match front page news moment. smaller local pharmacies nearby? might flexible, without needing corporate authorization. Lol, 2 weeks Guangzhou. I'm China right now. disagree you. fear worse variants also major factor Yay, cheaper lobsters!! basic reason part population care pandemic, follow precautions ,hence ,causing virus spread ,so yea ,its kinda dumb assume 1.3billion indians throw cow dung
EDIT- mean say case every country, ofcourse throwing cowdung lol look America ,so many anti vaxxers people believe there's virus ,the reason virus still cos people scheduled mine tomorrow Walgreens...I got Moderna vaccine. people cold?

They're cold, unfortunately they're plain old stupid. California QR code verified public health records protected Google pay Apple pay encryption. perfect, better card.  Sadly true.

Dude nut case health stuff That's thinking. maybe wait CVS flexible.

The trouble get shot telling truth embarrassing say least. 

I mean go tell Pfizer want Moderna - might deny annotate record well. location touristy part city likely lower rate vaccinated patrons City San Francisco's vax rate. Yes, loop.

If got Pfizer, ""healthy young person"" excludes percent people able get booster, due including people obese fat (around 80% US population), smokers, more. Then, even actually healthy young there's also exception people risk work, leave definition risk you. may healthy, young, thin people never smoked unemployed work remotely, point almost everyone legally included definition.

If got Moderna, today allows get booster conditions Pfizer, got J&amp;J today allows get booster even young healthy long 18 older. like even read articles, go straight comments.

Both posters theories gap explained higher number cases among men, differences pre-existing conditions explain detail quarantine measures currently place China. Go ahead prove actually know youre talking instead making shit up. http://www.sisa-news.com/mobile/article.html?no=176271

Dude, Delta got spread India clear variant would easily reach rest world matter weeks since people leaving country. like three times contagious COVID classic thus resisted little longer pandemic would bad today.

Any variant outmatched Delta, making COVID pandemic ""Delta pandemic"". Maybe would variants circulating, nothing bad Delta.

Any new variant reaches territory eventually cause another outbreak.

Simply fair.  Thanks. True. basically need mix match, need lie 1st 2 doses.

Maybe kids better raised stupid parents. bit sexist m8 I'll tell main reason mandatory dose gap doses set government 80 days....it's cos vaccination rates slowing 80% adults recieved first dose vaccination kids 18 started yet three million Americans die every year.

There study Moderna half dose. know efficacy relates Moderna full dose. believe people become cold suspect manipulated, trying see point view. already gave that. hospitals overcrowded. unviable hope medical emergency, huge burden hospital workers, handle forever. leaving (whether go unreplaced, replaced someone newly trained thus less experienced) compounds problem.

Testing least scientific give us actual data. highly vaxxed state never brought mask back May. peak hospitalizations ~1,200 December 2020. hospitals overwhelmed people medical emergencies able receive care.

At delta peak, ~300 people hospital. ~200 people hospital. No, hospitals aren’t overwhelmed. Move hell on. …..never, unfortunately.

At point Covid going us forever. get vaxxed, wear mask community transmission still high, wash hands, live life somewhat normally. tend agree, mind means need start thinking off-ramps mitigation strategies. highly vaxxed state peaked hospitalizations December 2020 1,200 people hospital. delta peak ~300 people hospital, currently ~200 people hospital.

Last week mayor announced hospital COVID patients all. They're still detecting new infections though. Wtf happening Singapore  wants celebrity- scientist. unvaccinated people less likely get tested.

This helps spread virus. Even 3g 2g- events coming. term 3g? Germany means certain event tested vaccinated recovered. Meaning vaccinated people need tests. Even worse: 2g, meaning vaccinated people, tests.

And even dance clubs, people tight together.

So lot vaccinated untested people meet virus spreads there. Since Delta, learned vaccinated people spread virus long, intense.

In Münster, Germany, case 380 people met club, vaccinated. 85 got infected. That's like Ischgl, infected get sick.

That speaks testing, also vaccinated people. believed would factoring natural immunity, not. logical solution would immunity testing mandate, least see among entire population, vaccinated non, actually protection. Sure, virus particles enter vaccinated person's body deactivated immune system. clinical trials tested vaccine efficacy sampling *detectable infections*. 95% meant frequently tested control test groups, test groups 95% lower risk *detectable infection*, 95% lower risk symptomatic infection.

If Delta variant causing much higher viral loads vaccinated people, implications herd immunity. Yes, question whether reduce hospitalisations. vaccines 100% effective. Delta requires 85% herd immunity vaccine 80% effective could vaccinate 100% population enough herd immunity. Nope even 100% fully vaccinated, Delta infectious enough R-value remain 1. Florida's stats trustworthy. They're delaying reporting deaths long periods seems they're great present.

For example, today yesterday added enough deaths raise 7-day average September 2nd 5 (so 35 deaths week). they're still hold back death counts almost 2 months ago tells lot. native Americans really refer American Indian?    There’s way less 100k cases total. It’s state sponsored cover-up actual numbers. Yes excess deaths proper metric. match covid death stats, right, overcount covid deaths. would also mentioning mutation massively overhyped recently declining proportion cases anyway. Bad news gets clicks.    know US likes push countries, especially Britain comes healthcare obvious reasons, caveat quoting BMA doctors union. still paying healthcare smokers drinkers. Smokers drinkers taking resources could spent people need medical care smoke drink. non-smokers non-drinkers forced pay healthcare someone knowingly bad them?

And car crash injuries, especially solo accidents? person chose get car, knowing chance crashing there. everyone forced chip pay person's care could chosen drive?

Not Covid vaccine valid reason deny healthcare anything else Covid written news. Infact opposite.  also suggests relying vaccines reach kind herd immunity futile.

And realising this? Also see Singapore, 85% overall population vaccinated October deaths spread disease ever before. Good ""proof"". Yeah, areas vaccinated things freely unvaccinated can't test before, think reasonable believe vaccinated spreading considering immunity vanes.

I think anyone even anti-vaxxers claiming given scenario vaccinated would spreading more. want herd immunity without 100% effective vaccine (which vaccine ever achieved), need people going bars get infected. need generations worth time accept sweeping restrictions.

I haven’t outside Japan throughout pandemic, observations limited, however, it’s interesting notice differences attitudes towards pandemic Japan western countries. seems go little like this: 
 
(West) / (Japan) 
 
This whole thing China’s fault. / Wherever came from, dangerous. world outside Japan dangerous. 
 
(At beginning) Psh. mask won’t anything. think little paper mask going protect deadly virus? / don’t know bad is, least cover mouths noses. 
 
(The government early on) getting hand. better shut everything down. Sorry, everyone. Sorry, economy. / deal unobtrusive way? Let’s put recommendations send everyone mask. 
 
(Some people) I’m going wear mask. It’s right to. fight right. don’t care hospitals overflowing. / It’s pretty easy wear mask, doesn’t hurt me, could save others. 
 
(Most people) I’ll government tells us. seems fair enough. / Politicians aren’t best people there. Let’s use common sense. 
 
(At beginning) Dr. Dingleberry USA says shouldn’t wear masks, sounds right me. / Didn’t learn elementary school viruses spread bodily fluids? 
 
I’m clean enough. Everything’s good. / (綺麗 (kirei) Japanese word means beauty cleanliness. words, beauty inseparable cleanliness.) 
 
Alright. I’m vaxxed. Time take mask get it. / pandemic still on, would take mask, even I’m vaxxed? I’ve wearing mask public year half. It’s really difficult thing do. course take then, like I’m eating, long smart it. keep steady, balanced standpoint. 
 
(Government) Don’t let people move around. Keep little bubbles. / Let’s make suggestions getting together big groups. way, people aren’t traveling much Japan. Let’s make domestic travel incentives economy doesn’t tank. 
 
Current stats deaths per millions people: 
 
Japan: 144 
South Korea: 53 
China: 67 
Canada: 751 
USA: 2260 
UK: 2036 It’s mask, maybe ask kids give shit. Even official Pfizer (what vaccine there?) numbers 95% efficacy. means 2500 50000 infected. lower number expected? self report get positive result

Cool, instead getting required testing, implementing **trust system** take tests self-report positives? I'm sure abused all.

Desantis cares much unemployment payments fired vaccinated. Though never happen doesn’t care it’s political stunt. Looking part makes us human. However, people don’t get jabbed don’t care others.  Pure speculation part, but:

Perhaps unvaccinated people less likely get tested. could mean less infections among unvaccinated discovered, meaning stats could skewed towards shoving vaccinated likely infected. Oceans. Fish.

My friend lupus got booster early doctor know getting COVID someone autoimmune disease good situation. Yes. Gets cold people spend time inside. think likely resentment get treatment. guys think ""tough out"" view going hospital/doctor weak.  gasping breath ICU anything survive. They’ll take it.   Lmao unique one :/ US resident, garbage. could post hundreds links leaders say still catch Covid. Dropping masks vaccinated people came warnings case numbers incentive get vaccinated. Part issue concerted effort Russia hype Sputnik vax downing Pfizer AZ vaxes. went wrong well citizens took mean vaxes bad including Sputnik. actually 50 micrograms, milligrams. Getting mine 2 hours! Signed first thing morning Moderna Walgreens. received J&amp;J shot almost 7 months ago I've waiting day. anyone know long estimate boosters sustain infection immunity for? another 7 months? Got scheduled CVS morning. England exception? facing exact problem inside U.K.?  long till booster comes effect. didn’t sell way US. fault even Biden, Fauci CDC HORRIBLE messaging. 

The belief get shot, don’t get covid. even rolled new version Mission Accomplished banner May severe reduction mask requirements allowed unvaccinated roam maskless again. Caucajuns! worth I'm Singaporean, took Pfizer first round literally got Moderna booster (I'm waiting 30 mins centre monitor reactions). official notice treat MRNA jabs interchangeable booster purposes. CVS lets select, sure pharmacies too. Britain becomes danger, Corona virtually impossible. talking delta specific vaccine? I’ve heard nothing. seems crazy hasn’t outcry health agencies, media commentary drug companies. still peddling old partially effective vaccines? thought spinning modified vaccines quickly one hallmarks MRNA technology? Even it’s going slower like DISCUSSION? Agreed, honestly pretty big impairment instruction supposed get flu shot? told get flu first wait least two weeks. believe better communication decisiveness government RIVM would gone long way.

Sadly, gave population conflicting information never really enforced proper lockdown. variant yet proven escape vaccine sorry, 2022. remember three biggest airlines, Air China, China Southern Airlines China Eastern Airlines, said earnings calls CAAC's restrictions international flights may continue first half 2022, given government's COVID-19 prevention approach around Beijing Winter Olympics February, Parash Jain, head shipping, ports Asian transport research HSBC, said note Wednesday.  would push full recovery 2024, Jain 100% adults vaccinated, 100% hospitalisations vaccinated.

I'm certain I'll test + weekend. Wish available last week   new variant spread widely enough yet primary issue.   J&amp;J scheduled Moderna booster Monday night! Yes, 1.67 times Pfizer dose, point. They’re friends, they’re family members. one many studies go it; summary paper arguing mask usage covered lot different angles make case mask wearing works:  article seems trying make case curiously never states many cases hospitalizations vaccinated. don’t find suspicious? 100% cases could unvaccinated.  Florida undercounts COVID cases COVID deaths. COVID remains major public healh threat. past weeks 100 people Florida died day COVID. Nose tickles around.

I can’t wait vaccinated. Exactly! doesn’t change fact hospitalized dead covid patients unvaccinated. Apple product mind buying Oracle software, made humans. Oracle doesn’t suck computer something, Oracle sucks programmers made mistakes, wasn’t set correctly, user made mistake. Problems like always fault humans… saying “computer glitch” shifting blame.  Good China. bottom-dwelling cold water crustacean give us respiratory virus. expensive.

Only one lines DeSantis’ pockets. Backups fix operator/user error 99% time. Sure, computer might stop working, that’s rare. delete bunch important files need fetch backups that’s computer’s fault.   Computer “mistakes” always programmer/operator mistakes. Sure, computer could fail turn on, hard drive could crash, failing use database correctly human error. still bad county 99.7% vaccination rate? 

Because 99.7% vaccination rate? They've probably got denominator wrong, hard given infrequency censuses. still know long term effects covid. Survivors even mild cases left heart lung problems.

You making claim distrusting sources information. Thats fair can't trust everything facebook group. However source information. nice flowchart. based information week, use flowchart got Moderna, got J&amp;J, follow flow chart except 2 months getting J&amp;J, 6 people 65 may eligible based underlyng health conditions increased risk due occupational institutional setting may one cited scientists immunology, anti-vaxx repost Facebook got 98 likes last night soooo let know he’s level 💁🏻‍♀️

/s Meanwhile Covid going back internationally.   call ""significantly higher 3 months ago"" low ever going get. 6 months received 2nd injection.  I'm immune compromised, high risk disabled. fully vaccinated understand perfectly healthy people afraid it. bet people get flu vaccinations take medications doctors prescribe them. make sense me. 

Also, normalize blaming Dr. Fauci everything vaccine related. I'll agree masks schools *right now* pediatric vaccines allowed, necessary, closed unvaccinated population. said soon get back winter break, mask mandates need lifted replaced vaccine mandates. gives parents 2 months need do. 

Once pass point, excuses masks.

I work higher ed institution 98% vaccination rate, tests everyone weekly, still masks bonehead reason basically boils appearance safety squeamish returning. nonsense. saw headline though, OP *must* accidentally added comma. “vaccine mandates”? Dumb understandable. That’s politics. “vaccine, mandates”? That’s science! According [a THL working (PDF, Finnish, page 13) based data 23rd September, healthcare worker groups 1st dose rates 90% 80%. rates generally correlated education level work setting different professions instance practical nurses significantly lower rates RNs.  Reality covid stay learn live it. religion cult. Let’s honest here. Even worse that, takes five days minimum exposure able register positive test, two weeks. vaccine available, safest way clear travel mandate immediate two week quarantine tested cleared move around city. even recently, ""Ask country you, country."" theoretical population everyone vaccinated 100% infected would vaccinated. doesnt mean vaccine doesnt work though. UK people vaccinated not, logical given high overall infection rate countermeasures also many vaccinated get infected. somewhat selection bias, one doesnt automatically compare society without vaccine, many would get infected, get symptomatic die. vaccine protect severe illness death also infection, viral load reduces shortens transmission breakthrough cases. also waning protection, new variant reduced effectiveness high risk patients. Overall studies show vaccines still prevent many infections.

German health authority RKI explain higher vaccination rate, vaccination expected vaccination breakthroughs occur vaccination rate increases. vaccination rate rises, proportionally people expected vaccinated. relationship vaccination breakthroughs vaccination rate shown graphically diagram below. indication vaccines effective, explained (1) effectiveness COVID-19 vaccinations good, means although vaccines effective, cannot prevent infections people vaccinated. However, ensure infections much less common (see FAQ people fully vaccinated continue transmit virus?) serious COVID-19 disease courses become rare (2) vaccination rate rises, probability also rises vaccinated part population also include means: proportion vaccinated people population increases, probability also increases among people become infected fall ill, vaccinated people may affected. Put simply: people population vaccinated (vaccination rate 100%), percentage breakthroughs vaccination among infected 100% (if vaccine 100% (3) number breakthroughs also depends number active cases. active cases are, higher likelihood infected vaccinated means: little circulation pathogen population, likelihood infection decreases, number vaccination breakthroughs. Put simply: pathogen circulate all, vaccination breakthroughs. Literally nothing stops mixing matching now. FDA CDC ok’d it. difference Moderna/Pfizer mRNA vaccines J&amp;J use traditional adenovirus method. Letting stupid people weed since 2020, covid stupid reducer.  Good term. accurate titles TV news throws around. founding fathers even agree things like racial equality, ultimately culminated civil war, yes, idea freedom fully developed perfect. understand going flow thousands years history. contrast, current generations born freedom, look we've done it.  work.

It's simply tribalism. Critical thinking notion scientific process even relevant generation. He’s world renowned scientist one top experts infectious diseases. He’s great communicator asset US. He’s absolutely one good guys. 

Bad actors trying take every slight hint misstep destroy legacy. think family even received threats. We're booster twins! JJ April, getting Moderna today! Love downvotes. Reality bites. that’s point. message needs consistent; anyone brain knows that. don’t think it’s huge controversy CDC US government terrible messaging. 

About masks, first thing Fauci should’ve said ‘we aren’t sure masks work. going research this.’ truly believe first message masking, people would much likely listen. Instead, surgeon general said stop wearing masks. get good reason, still sowed confusion partially responsible mess now.  kids know masks literally keeping schools open. live next Idaho struggle w/ constant outbreaks/quarantine enough staff due illness. Masks work yes we’re still following state’s mandate. don’t want kids go remote again, it’s trade off. *crickets  Back spring vaccinations ramping kept harping you’re really fully vaccinated 2 weeks setting dose. 

Given that, plan boosters 6 months second shot? 6 months “fully vaccinated”, i.e. 2 weeks later. 

I can’t find clear guidance gut says probably doesn’t matter much want try I’m supposed do.  hasn’t seemed much increase case counts apartment countries vs house countries recently though.  Who's decided over? Please calm this. know guys excited get boosters, extremely minimal effect people causes massive amount stress pharmacy workers.  anybody link current guidelines booster shots? millennials Gen z get booster shots? completely disagree you, hardest part really understanding 'can trust source' personally think even important keep looking reading more. I'm expert studies study design, enjoy listening John Campbell times example since help us understand interpret data/claims. strike peddler misinformation.

However, believe disagreeing group consensus necessarily means peddling misinformation. Sometimes certainly always case. Indeed, given threat long COVID even relatively minor symptoms initially, even mild case tremendously costly, individual's quality life going forward health care system itself, provide care folks long term.  mixing Pfizer Moderna really ""mimic"" infection better? They're technology. thought Moderna showed better long-term strength larger dose. Freedom isn’t free NIH mix-n-match study measured antibody levels 9 possible combinations 3 vaccines; Moderna booster pretty consistently produced highest levels differences small, study used original 100mcg dose Moderna rather 50 mcg booster dose study population small.

I'd happy waiting 8 months more, visit family TX 2 weeks whole flying / going TX / visiting 65's worried. I'm ""young"" healthy rely existing double dose?! Since fit narrative, worth sharing? My, slightly educated way head read mind guess, recommendation easier tell people ""ok pfizer boosters 6 months keep good infection X months out"" etc. It'll combinatorial nightmare impossible really guide people mix match long efficacy lasting. Yeah made appointment booster pretty much exactly 6 months 2nd shot. I’m overweight (and working it) back working person feel risk moderate highish. totally healthy/normal weight still working home probably would put months least. I’m hoping protection booster lasts longer 6 months get yearly booster along flu shot every fall next year on. Yeah nursing staff likely well vaccinated, week case disease transmitted non-vaccinated nurse elderly person ended dying. still happen, course vaccination completely remove transmitting disease helps could block first place. something grandparents want do, think it. point assume taken commonsense precautions (getting vaccines recommended). Yes, COVID definitely dangerous elderly influenza that's commonsense precautions getting influenza.  think problem religious exemption people whose religions ""forbid"" vaccination one precepts.

There single major denomination problem vaccination. 

What occurring people using religious exemption loophole claiming ""religious"" exemption truth want vaccinated non-religious justifications anti-vax people have.

For example, Judaism religious objection vaccinated statistically Jews US among highest religious group vaccinated. One major beliefs preserving life takes precedent religious action - common example would one could drive hospital break Sabbath doctor work Sabbath save life. 

If anything Torah explicit instructions measures taken event plague mainstream Jewish religious organizations However, extreme anti-vax ""Jews"" find nutty ""rabbis"" claim religious exemption.

I would think thing occurring fundamentalist Christian ""religions"" since theoretically hierarchy Catholic Church Pope stated Covid vaccine taken Catholics. fallacy lies heart every major societal issue facing US today

Wouldn't go far. plenty major societal issues nothing misunderstanding personal freedom. Woohoo! work high risk profession. Wait… fair - 5 kids spending amount time ihop would give ton first hand experience every germ imaginable :)

/s, mostly ihop gross. also know many people fantastic immunity July seeing levels drop. thought be, part, least, behind current surges U.K. Europe, U.S tends run 6 - 8 weeks behind Europe, good bet we're going see cases go soon.  reminds data CDC spike covid cases Cape month'ish ago, many people vaccinated hospitalization  work *very* well known / software company and, based I've seen, hire anybody, say I'm glad like saying water wet.

When said company announced ""Vaccine mandate kicks American employees, care work home"", resulting email thread gobsmacking. People comparing Holocaust. People quoting saying ""\~708,000 dead counting accursed plague United States"" saying shit like ""Well people dead vaccines!?"" ""So want get vaccinatd? vaccinated, safe"" ignorant horse shit and/or bad faith arguing.

It got bad VP came *twice* shut thread. reasoning people view admitting made mistake learning said mistake signs wisdom humility weakness timidity, let's forget tribalization politics.

You understand all. think make sense. Florida there's little stopping virus transmitting people, infects available hosts quickly. swept like wildfire burned out. Oregon, mask mandate, virus patient sneaky. can't advance fast available host population, there's still lot people infect, lot fuel burn, speak. Masks offer protection, near perfect. 

I also say watch numbers pretty carefully, although days data obviously enough draw firm conclusion, look like may starting swing back based week's numbers. would actually make sense started getting significantly cooler wetter weeks ago put stop lot outdoor dining gathering going on. People wear masks they're eating nor, usually, they're gathered friends indoors. OK icu capacity metric sustaining Healthcare.

I don’t care states do. would insinuate me? don’t mask mandate doesn’t mean allowed socially move on. Outdoor events still cancelled name Covid. Businesses still cheapening hiding behind Covid reasons (the day cited example theaters don’t allow free popcorn refills anymore “in name Covid” yet it’s perfectly okay maskless theater. No, they’re trying save money). Hygiene theater, genuine Covid counter measures, still taken hold. University’s library workers barge privately booked study room, *get close student* tell wear mask even alone. don’t want society devolve hygiene theater Covid like security theater though would defer medical professionals see whether think system overburdened

These articles pointless.  statement make broader point new data emerges, recommendations consensus change. case, initial prevailing thought vaccines prevent transmissions. virus continued spread infectious variant circulated consensus change.

You made point skeptical someone makes claim contrary consensus I'm responding saying consensus seems changing lot. calling shift understanding light new circumstance. Fine, call want. 

Please, spare 'english language' comment. know get arrogant like that. odd.    think comparing apples oranges bit. Im saying low mortality rate majority people already vaccinated, creating restrictions low population people vax gotten covid yet group. diminishing trust science &amp; govt since ""trust science"" ""get vaccinated return normalcy"" mean absolutely nothing since vaxxed facing restrictions unvaxxed.  Death Expertise Tom Nichols, got ago trying get thru Thank much thoughts. Oddly, think newer study showing otherwise. said, result surprising counterintuitive me. What's little data supporting community masking able find basically nothing community largely vaccinated. accept it? local pharmacies still offering even though websites are…I scheduled Walmart morning get call almost immediately stating corporate still hasn’t approved.

Rite Aid CVS stated also waiting guidance.

Edit: Walmart called back un-cancelling appointment saying approval pfizer press release this? new, right? trial mostly Delta? forever? followed every rule theyve asked too. got vaccine soon able schedule it. hope could return life like 2 years ago youre basically saying need shit forever?! never going return life pre-2020 jump hoops?

Posting anti-covid things? Dude 13?
All us? There's us pathetic person whining Internet; you. statement reads applying vaccine effectiveness general. CDC director's statement applied then-emerging evidence delta variant's transmissibility among vaccinated people. taken context argue prior claims vaccine preventing transmission false. not.

Vaccines reduce transmission COVID-19, less effective reducing spread delta variant particular. Meanwhile, vaccines continue highly effective reducing serious illness death **all** variants.

This indicate change consensus. indicates shifting understanding light new circumstances (i.e., new variant). People understand science English language able understand distinction.     shit. Whats opinion? Why? Anyone read soon Boosting immunity back up? 2 weeks like getting second dose? “Do research” stupidest phrase English language point.

Too many people think internet non-fiction section library everything 100% factual find ONE website THINK says want believe quote 100% fact even 100 others say complete opposite. Exactly! Seems would rather listen ""patriots"" ""real news"" since science (in opinion) ""polluted"". surrounded this. smh  kind well-known company work allows reply-all company-wide emails lol extended family member ivermectin months now. crazy before. crazy (maybe even moreso). worst part one person's offspring medical doctor- although seemingly horrible one can't even get mother take poison.

She tries get immediate family start taking ivermectin, they're smart enough reply ""you realize \[insert family member here\] worked vaccine right? We're good doctor's advice"". 

It sad watching family poison themselves, they're also horrible people, well, kind gave trying stop them. almost Fauci say anything keep name news.

And telling me, start this, science know airborne virus would reduced masks?  How? I'm still covid unvaccinated tested regularly work. Ive yet get covid, damage doing? It’s absolutely ridiculous. USA withdrawal amount bad advice they’ve delving makes CDC look competent. also said late February covid wasn’t global threat.

as opposed to

You argue want wanting save medical personnel, asked home made cloth masks, specifically said effective. *Specifically*.

The science really clear, yet ignored. Moderna much bigger dose (currently 100, maybe soon 50, versus 30 pfizer), gives somewhat higher immunity several times side effects (including myocarditis). People 30, maybe 40, absolutely get 100 mcg dose - absurdly harmful making recommendation, since high moderna myocarditis rate one strongest anti-vax arguments. People 70, maybe 50, get largest dose can. part. Half parents America seem intent raising children hate, intolerance, willful ignorance.    Agreed, vaccine developed alpha many variants.  everyone acting surprised currently available vaccines work well new variants? Fair enough! makes sense. interesting process see steps go kinds decisions actually rolling - reporting never seem provide details able figure out! US also unlikely caught recorded every case though feel jealous people worried booster get still difficult get first dose country?  Oh absolutely agree.

Vaccines help reduce infections deaths don’t eliminate them. Medicine help eliminate hospitalization deaths eliminate. point better medicine vaccines come along might take 10 years get right technology. 

In meantime, hospitalizations deaths; probably lower didn’t anything shouldn’t make mission drive Covid zero since won’t get time soon ever Hospital admissions deaths definitively low, manageable. 
Hospital admissions currently 25% peak increasing. simple way relaxed towards adult vaccinations general, nothing conspiracy theories, simply care much. Influenza, tick-borne encephalitis, tetanus - many people take vaccines.  Agreed much summer wave last year either - everyone everything outside summer around here, businesses quickly adjusted open windows outdoor dining. Indeed, tourist towns closing roads could used outdoor dining, last summer best tourist season record.

But fall earlier here. Cases started rising October last year low baseline, happening high baseline. *might* past case peak, though; clear another week. hospital situation already quite dire certain get least somewhat worse.

I'm ready go back living ""normally"", save wearing masks indoor settings whenever possible. see need booster situation, think healthy people need unless constantlyfrequently high risk situations around high risk people.  look Mayim Bialik information neuroscience. lot parent needing teach example. Kids repeat see adults do. willing apologize child wrong show respect. Say please, thank welcome kids. Allow full control bodily autonomy forcing hugs kisses. Listen really conversation them.  


I think lot parents overwhelmed today's world enough time things kids. get issue housing prices insane wages depressed. need make possible parents able kids want anything change.  Oh they've given mixed booster shots before. first knowingly gave one. Problem media without scientific background trying interpret science often get wrong coupled media liking drama present sides....both sides story useful cases side average joe claims read stuff evidence themselves. dumb question all, would best verify doctor (either full half-dose) recommended her. 

The additional dose Moderna full dose one moderately severely immunocompromised. mom meet conditions, would, based said (age, high blood pressure, 6 months since last dose), qualify half-dose Moderna info CDC qualifies additional dose (again, case Moderna, would full dose dose first two series). 

And info CDC qualifies half-dose Moderna booster.

I hope helps!   thought - looks like FDA Oct 26th, CDC Nov 2nd 3rd    don’t really get take. internet made people afraid “nerd culture”? 

Can give examples you’re talking haven’t seen anyone power terrified intellectuals simply they’re smart dignified. 

And important scientific figures well known internet 😂😂 Yo 13 year old. Still awake? past bedtime 😂  Half dose checked booster dose. full dose immunocompromised individuals not. moderna first two.  Unfortunately point choose heed word science, signing early grave. survival fittest. here. age 40, BMI 21, never smoked, work home. FOMO, want 3rd Moderna. option ask get tested meet refuse vaccine. Still 100% avoidance plan, gives everyone better idea stand. Pretty decent article...

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  It’s computer virus, functions like Ultron takes internet thought meeting October 26? Forgive question long covid data source.

First off, claims 3.4% population symptoms, 5.0% covid patients do. 

Then, claims numbers 4.2% vs 3.1% kids. 

This wildly sync research facially questionable tweet nothing put mind rest.

That said, also know covid causes quite bit damage. can't even guess developmental consequences children right now.

I think getting ""let's vaccinate kids ever demand schools add long list required vaccines"". five kids least one parent vaccinated?  cannot wrap head around it. Yeah moderna before.  know, try. naiv mind says maybe scared cases open fact-based reasoning help. sometimes don't. anyway, try evoke civil conversation.

having said that, maintain many people, amount reasoning help skepticims based reason feelings (fear of: analysing understanding situation, exploring options consequences, making decision live it) There’s really risk getting (chance side effects 1 day) nothing reward. you’re thinking about, get it. Personally, worried announce Delta². It’s shitty journalism general shouldn’t written. It’s literally misleading gets nothing spread antivaxxer mob mentality. 

Vaccines don’t prevent infection, prevent disease. 99.7% eligible population vaccinated include immunocompromised children still recommended get tested Covid around area exposure even asymptomatic don’t want risk spreading disease unvaccinated. 

The article useless saying “paying maths tutor improve student’s basketball skills.” It’s nothing selective faulty journalism. find bizzare article mentioned NOTHING incidence hospitalisation ICU that’s vaccines intended prevent. Vaccines don’t prevent infection. think there’s lot people truly apathetic, getting to, one reason another. Maybe it’s travel, maybe it’s work requirement, maybe live city starting require proof vax bars, gyms, etc, maybe family member won’t see get it. Never underestimate truly lazy people be.  Ok thanks feel free DM think story happened wanted point well-known software company safeguards place prevent replypocalypse level shenanigans. Surely make distro used authorized individuals?

that's unbelievable part story, deluge ignorant replies otherwise intelligent educated employees. People believe whatever suits interests. Business owners deny downplay virus restrictions fear hurts bottom line. strongly believe Covid denial due people losing $ deny problem get back normalcy Eh envisioning wild animals. fun cages. Back March 2020, Dr. Fauci said masks unnecessary. Why? part, shortage professional-grade masks protective gear. Healthcare workers often forced reuse masks wear Hefty bags makeshift gowns. 

In addition, little known efficiency cloth masks. also less knowledge back new virus transmitted.

When professional supplies became available, cloth masks tested, known SARS-CoV-2 transmitted, Dr. Fauci, along overwhelming majority health officials, strongly recommended mask-wearing.

This scientific knowledge evolves.   ... I'm okay. Nice! first two doses Moderna well? Let us know feel tomorrow please! Ironically, someone identified told something, even stupid involved bleach, would believe it. people opposite integrity. Yeah got thru grocery store otherwise I’d driving 100 miles. 3 sign though Thanks! I’m hold verify won’t turn away  give numbers debunk claim, states 45 new vaccinated deaths added week assumes that's 45% claim came from. even show Twitter post allege 'debunking'. know number unvaccinated deaths, agree AP article mention, say number vaccinated deaths 45%? 

I agree need conspiracy; 100% population vaccinated, 100% deaths vaccinated. mean vaccine working. feel article could written better. hindsight say lot things.

There lot pointless clickbait big spooky variant Brazil manifested fuck all. I’m getting article, NIH apparently fund virus research, unclear “covid research” (if indeed happening) apart funding not. Keep posted thanks!  Thanks!  [Graph increasing since late Sept.  FYI, able get Moderna booster (originally J&amp;J recipient March) around 1:30pm CDT Walgreens issue! good luck.  expensive! excited see one open Canada like $50 omlette coffee. Denny's way better.

Ironically, seems like best case scenario. Double Delta entered chat lied half much, maybe something said would come credible. vaccine works get shot protected! typical course vaccines take effective way, they?

No, aren't. Otherwise panic every time there's measles outbreak. vaccines less 100% effective, although much less varies.

Biology (and therefore medicine) messy. ever think anything biology 100% black-and-white carefully check assumptions. certain ""truth oriented"" social networks emerge fight ""censorship"", expect get worse. Right atleast attempt fact checking. 40% country moves networks, expect things get much much worse. Yeah may hundreds symptoms..   good one. :) fauci spread misinformation beginning pandemic he’s part problem do, chips give sweet 5G, 4G.  husband boat (minus upcoming travel/wedding) decided get booster. add extra layer protection around 3 year old. Mind boggling, borrow virology term, pathogenesis anti-vax propaganda develops disseminates horrifying yet fascinating watch. I've developed pretty bad hobby keeping various forums comment sections. enough see memes get bubbled depths obscure web site, comment posted somebodies mom facebook.  time give anti-vaxers. Science, reason, concern fellows convinced nothing else likely it. live, die, permanently scarred, nothing else help take chances. considered murder. really think government 100% honest entire pandemic feel sorry you.  Went early, got Moderna booster little hassle. One tech thought couldn't, pharmacist said OK. Forms fill Moderna originally J&amp;J booster forms yet.

Might mileage vary situation said first mixed booster shot ever given people bit concerned getting it.   zero indication idea talking about, since data shown yet. However plenty data shows vaccines sufficient 3-4 doses. 

Stop trying look smart projecting misinformation. look good you.   Hollywood whole lotta morons believing common enemy world aliens advanced tech. know, something insurmountable worthy guns grudge-filled treachery. virus cut them.  think calculated anything misinterpreted number 45. But, ironic percent similar. I'm surprised high vaccinated percent. Plus, vaccinated biased towards older people also likely infected. Coronavirus like: attack lungs 
Lobsters like: weaknesses remember! think lot messages around boosters politically motivated. young healthy anxious need booster right now, especially much world still unvaccinated.

I'm mid 30s healthy. never COVID got two shots Moderna March/April. second shot really knocked feel like worth get again.  get caught lying? That’s rich. actual proportion 45% claimed guy twitter, 51%:  “Begins administering non-human primates” TIFIFY got Moderna booster Kroger. Pharmacist said he's done today. first educator booster he'd had. Arm sore feel fine. Arm bad time 2nd one. Chair right! I've started reading methodology now. interesting far. Good sample size, etc. finish lessons done.   It’s minor thing, word play screw interpretation many eyes watching:

From 2015 31 August 2021, vaccine defined “a product stimulates person’s immune system produce immunity particular disease, protect person disease” vaccination “the act introducing vaccine body produce immunity particular disease. “

Earlier versions vaccine definition also included “immunity” definition.

The new definition vaccine reads: “A preparation used stimulate body’s immune response disease”, vaccination “the act introducing vaccine body produce protection particular disease.”

I apologize comes poor format, I’m moment.  able get mine Walmart 4 hours ago. really easy, filled questions online making appointment. Pharmacist super nice delivered pain-free shot I've had.  


It's probably combo - far arm (while little bit sore) much less sore first two shots, flu shot.  feel bit tired, otherwise okay far. I'm anxious early morning, that's second dose hit - though really bad either. nobody believes could hire qualified high-end engineers come decent math background States

Texas A&amp;M University literally restructured engineering degree freshman go “Freshman Engineering” major year 1 engineering degree you’re allowed declare specialize engineering field choosing specific problem: US students weren’t industry needed math. 

When found that’s program restructured way, lost faith American education system. 🙃 appointment Walgreens morning booster got told weren’t ready rollout come back Monday. went another Walgreens CVS area also said come back Monday. called around finally able make appointment different CVS. Pharmacist told came morning, saw appointments system wasn’t expecting them, people working counter super confused people coming boosters pharmacist told okay. J&amp;Jer got Moderna boost well! Hopefully things streamlined next week. mentioned thread, 3 weeks ago VRBPAC hesitant even recommend boosters anyone 65.  reason AP debunks tweet without providing total numbers deaths debunked 45% actually lower proportion reported deaths vaccinated people, 51% (the reason high number probably deaths happened past reported delay).

Here tweet, guy notes report red 45 deaths vaccinated people, reason writes 45% 45 deaths reported period 3. October including 9.October

According Massachusetts Dashboard total 87 deaths period. 45 87 Oct.: 12

04 Oct.: 13

05 Oct.: 11

06 Oct.: 16

07 Oct.: 19

08 Oct.: 4

09 Oct.: 12 zero indication boosters provide long lasting sterilizing immunity needed abandon masks. 

You’d need booster every 6 months rest life proposing keeping protection levels high. don’t know means booster every 6 months, still don’t know long good protection lasts 3rd dose.  Mind bottling. cause makes want explode. Well, Ireland started much different place international hub like London is. think make direct comparison.

Even could, want ask whether risk tolerance would demand mitigations. Keep mind, N95 masks widely available; anyone wants one protection far better two people wearing surgical masks.  goalposts outside stadium    Russians traditionally consume house plants medical purposes (Calassia fragrans well several assorted Kalanchoes), even though evidence help even though may harmful)? tradition Soviet times, believe, medicine short supply.

I found real sources claim; absed memory last year's events. point timeline looked like this: 3rd ir 4th week March 2020, officials claimed Covid prevalent problem Russia. changed tack started halfhearted lockdowns. June/July (Euro games) let everyone stadiums pretended problem Covid, propagandistic purposes (to fair, British government same). claim was, Corona Russia ""in retreat"".

And articles point out, Putin always shied away telling people truth, instead leaving lower ranks announce unpopular measures. weakens response right   I’ll get Pfizer third dose next week 2 Sinovac doses. 4G+5G+viral shedding. hope Kazakh kitty vaccine arrives third dose, otherwise cats get Covid \#wakeup families alike; every unhappy family unhappy way."" - Leo Tolstoy saying UK broad, could different areas spiking different times resulting high overall case number. It’s easier see spread fall US looking states affected earliest delta. Alabama, Arkansas, Florida examples pretty irrelevant.  Facts &lt; money &lt; agenda Oh good, another picture guy hazmat suit spraying disinfectant street. Moderna booster half dose (50 vs 100 units) less side effects. Pfizer doses even smaller 30. worried side effects definitely get Pfizer. murder husband legally. It's... covid deaths. better get covid all. know ""long covid""?  address study controlled it. Walensky said people become eligible booster shots may need change definition fully vaccinated. think statement undermines effectiveness vaccines. still get excellent protection death severe disease two doses. 

I truly understand motivation goals COVID. seems like end game her. horrible messenger. vaccinating kids? Yeah. least they're helping ICU capacity.

Sigh; groan.  probably good reasons be. Cool! Yeah I’m curious. Thanks Yeah even wasn’t mandatory people given choice wear not. sure people downvoting original reply 🤷🏾‍♀️  Poland horrible Alpha wave spring plunged tapered summer. skated summer without Delta wave. What's happening almost certainly Delta wave that, gathers steam, rips almost unbelievable spread... looks like trajectory almost identical timing slope time last year. Big difference, though: vaccines last year, half Poland fully vaccinated. That's enough stop wave, hopefully enough tame wave bad. Hoping praying... know, would characterize political leaning Colorado Springs?

Literally Galt's Gulch. mostly unvaccinated (kids) vaccinated people spend lot time (patents teachers).

Same thing Israel. **No shit Sherlock!**

You need scientific study figure out? moron tell this. advanced care plan filed federal government health organisation, assume similar thing. Decades ago reading Gone Wind passage regarding this. Scarlet courted two twins beginning. twins took great pride wealthy therefore discouraged intellectual pursuits. nerd appalled. apparently cult ignorance existed hundreds years. Darwinismen strikes again.  make “living will” situations. modify months ago regarding vaccination means? I’m particularly potential change article about, especially near future, I’m unaware change considered “fully vaccinated” since term coined early winter. Anybody mix match effect?

I got 2 Moderna's, 2nd one absolutely destroying me. wanna get mRNA booster bunch traveling winter, I'm trying avoid going again. to, curious anybody got Moderna, Pfizer, Moderna Moderna, side effects less switching Pfizer less switching half-dose Moderna booster. understand plants crave electrolytes  Officially: no, living someone immunocompromised qualify you.

Practically: yes, US system run entirely self-attestations, simply attest qualifying group even not.

One thing watch for: original course Moderna attest immunocompromised, likely offered additional dose (at 100mcg) rather booster dose (at 50mcg). probably want booster dose, self-attest group qualifies booster, additional dose. feel like something able decided patient lucid. Like DNR notices. understand date associated this. can't lift restrictions based data? Given age stratified risk, probably like 10%. BBC regarding trust vaccines around world

Eastern Europe bottom idea science sort liberal agenda what's mind boggling me. 2nd shot number (Pfizer), third gave really sore arm. FWIW Pfizer [their study began gathering data 7 days giving COVID-19 occurrence measured least 7 days booster placebo I’m even fauci fan whatever specifically remember March medical professionals saying likely transmitted touch wearing gloves masks, later found masks important gloves. seems like saying lied bit stretch, even say shouldn’t buy masks reserve masks doctors health care workers, don’t see something discredits medical professional  Yes peer reviewed, double blind style study self reported style study based questionnaires done 3 different waves, built many different well checked, cited peer reviewed studies, provided verifiable checks system called hierarchical logistic regression analyses. data, corrected things like political bias, age, etc, uncorrected available download.  odds contract soon?

The odds low. need worry cautious, (very) unlikely event positive spread it. real way like Japan. someone wants wear sick go ahead! It’ll normalized enough. mandatory won’t thing forever. Hilarious. They're killing Atheists never seem require exorcisms. Hah! feeling bad. Sure masks, vaccinations, general i’ distancing? would honesty lack honesty play role that..? It’s science know Fauci highly respected loved many scientists science-minded people. boggles mind see widespread hate him, understand all. heard many times random people ""leaked emails"" show lying everything, reality emails show nothing dedicated, rigorous, intelligent individual job best ability. like fact ""leaked emails"" exist makes dumb people assume he's hiding something, without even asking would hiding where, actually, evidence this? see correlation qualms firing people refuse get vaccinated without valid medical reason shunning like lepers Biblical times.

Thanks providing walking petri dishes virus mutate, fellas! Bang job make 2022 suck deep fried hog anus, too!  OP. labelled good news means might enforcement boostering up. Virtually country's confirmed case total accurate, large fraction people get infected never get PCR test.

This especially true early pandemic. first outbreak occurred Wuhan, enough testing capacity keep up. February 2020, even started counting cases ""confirmed"" without PCR test Wuhan, based chest X-rays.

If want accurate estimate number infections, look serology - antibodies. done multiple groups China. results show percent people Wuhan infected first wave. Outside Wuhan nearby cities, basically 0% people infected first wave.

The lockdowns early 2020 China worked, since then, country managed prevent virus reestablishing foothold. time ventilator necessary, patient longer lucid able responsibly make decisions, authority passed next kin, respect patient's previously stated wishes. Honduras  I’m getting vaccinated every six months unless someone says otherwise. use IFR% lower CFR way actually know correct ifr relies estimating number cases asymptomatic people tested symptomatic cases people refused tested.  

The way really know ifr done mass testing along capture infection rates. sleep mask on? german russian roots lived year rural united states say striking similarities rural russians rural americans.

Government seen suspicion.

I think comes fact live harsher environment must rely themself first. Cant always count state like germany.

The culture toughness seems manifestation that. liquids adhere solid materials, causes become wet.   use cause things become wet? dryness? No. total deaths normal. extra ones covid. can’t explain away disagreeing filing. governments ever corrupt, governments use crisis overextend power basically happened 99% time.

Replication errors cause mutations.  mutations infectious replicate faster spread faster compete existing variants. 

There evolutionary pressure driving mutations.   

COVID long symptom onset timeframe meaning COVID could kill every single person infected since takes 3-5 days normally show symptoms, everyone person came contact showed symptoms screwed would way know.  Death usually follow 20-30 days initial exposure. Unless enacted lockdowns, daily testing everyone one left house reason multiple infectious periods . 

We already seen COVID far deadly pandemic entire populations would wiped people can’t handle restricted others good  collect mask though kind suckibg towards you. mean McDonald's cup ideally cover mouth eat it, although always bag   email bullshitnews@gmail.com  understanding would diluted drawn can't seem find article anywhere driving nuts must deleted things changed. Count Trump in.    Covid death UK death within 28 days positive test. positive tests = deaths within 28 days positive test.

Some going virus, almost unvaccinated people. many not, ""vaccinated Covid deaths"" Covid.  seen green ketchup working hospital pov, wont dropping masks even over. depressing, visitors see letting maskless. security called daily visitors wanting wear one now. Ok, sounds like saying hope everyone eventually get vaccinated that's ultimately change things.

I assuming probably ever happen would love pleasantly surprised! So, point post trying better understand else would change case everyone ended getting vaccinated.  might right, subjectively would find sad outcome. Glad got good vaccines! Cool. It'll go 5 - 12 year old kids get vaccinated too. htink may finally headed right direction again. Unless live Texas Florida. get “experimental” vaccine get much experimental monoclonal antibodies still makes sense. count deaths loosely rising number suggests something abnormal driving increase. think covid cases rise ahead totally unrelated deaths get counted covid? 1600 deaths per day.... Still....!

Is insane anyone else? No. know particular test. doubt it, fact. cruising Sam's couple days ago saw them. Probably soon, watched whole cdc meeting seemed like panel members hated folks 50 considered boosters (the high risk, health workers group etc..). felt data said people 50 need except jnj 

If watch meeting talk towards end (2nd last power point) Hefty amount misinformation going around.

The congressional commission inquiry found believe sufficient evidence **bring charges** crimes.

But commission power convict (headline says convicted, true), even indict him. referral federal AG may may indict.

--

In practical terns, avenue Congress open impeachment procedures -- good luck one, speaker house fully pocket.

--

tl;dr -- Quite possibly, another Pizza. say Covid fake. said UK counts Covid deaths loosely. last 2 months articles come saying vaccination reduces chance incubating disease.

[Vaccinated people still become infected potential spread virus others, although much lower rates unvaccinated new study CDC published Friday finds people vaccinated far less likely develop COVID-19 hospitalized die disease. Compared people vaccinated, people vaccinated five times less likely develop test using? idea. seems easier get shot swabbed every single time work.

Not mention overall societal benefits said makes sense. hospital fill fake covid cases? Exactly, guy Oxford Univeristy investigate chores lab-leak theory Murdock's emdia empire mystery me.

Example:

Science Closes Covid’s read fact comment clearly misrepresented data imply vaccine dramatically reduces risk infection. Even 100 fold (sources below) decrease risk enough, reduction risk serious illness death enough reason warrant testing one group another group getting tested majority people getting sick, seriously ill dying.

That said decision elected officials place business test frequency I'd fine it, vaccinated not. subscribe newsletter! Exactly. Thank you! gives shit waited August? got vaccine. Get it. hyper aggressive attitude Redditors towards jump first opportunity get vaccine really off-putting quite frankly, really immature. High risk also includes depression overweight. like 74% adults quality something like that. I’m gonna trust NHS saying please stop protecting people refuse get vaccinated   studies coming suggesting build better immunity immune response spacing shots 8 - 12 weeks.  could kept low measures numbers reported aren’t representation actual testing results people aren’t tested. 

In province Canada largest city plugging along 10-20 new cases per day rest positivity rate 1.3%. Outside city it’s 3.8% it’s estimated one southern religious region 30k people extremely high test positivity ratio one tested don’t believe COVID serious don’t want tested close contacts aren’t quarantined etc.  small population makes half icu admissions hospitalization patients admitted without previous COVID test.  know infection rate high based icu hospitalization number wack limited positive test results. 

If fact none true Russia spike indeed concerning doesn’t bode well rest world. !RemindMe 1 year add least another 100 years that. Tzarist russia even worse people. 19th century 2/3 population slave status  I’m vaccinated would gladly fill positions Apple they’re looking hire. thing sucked SUNY damn cold weather.

Coronaviruses even considered potential pandemic threat SARS 2003. 

Now Influenza family Coronavirus family viruses keep track watch *next* pandemic, surely happen again. even appropriate metaphor think time would nuance further, much argue about. ""The USA bad broken"" broad brush really answer pockets USA covid control--to use term--should hold policies aimed unrealistic end goal (covid zero). case I'd willing continue masking accept new normal. 

Times change. People complained like hell seatbelts cars became mandatory, end benefits outweigh minor inconveniences. course case case: Patriot Act, TSA, etc. situation new normal better.

In case, masks normalized, people try come better, comfortable masks allow better speech breathing, customizability individual wearer. Appreciate it.

The guidance Pfizer boosters pretty dang broad. ""Since risk vary across settings based much COVID-19 spreading community, people aged 18–64 years increased risk COVID-19 exposure transmission occupational institutional setting may get booster shot considering individual risks benefits."" job causes interact person people really lie say fall within definition higher risk. Binax $14 2 tests. Results 15 min. onerous. let me. doctor said I'm rock hard place agree. need personally attack someone trying healthy. want people healthy, consider adding positivity much negative. Stress plays big part health also, internet bully help anything.    great, there's constant churn - relative 0%.     Yay. wish could get tomorrow I’m state apparently sign cdc correct. would wasteful produce extra vials booster since vaccine, different dose.   believe risk aversion mask wearing areas, especially kids, case loads high UK, combined fact whole segments population vaccinated all. need evaluate case load beginning delta, compare UK's initial spike, UKs case load now, difference vaccination point, even New England now, significant terms spread.

There significant policy differences though. huge number kids testing positive driving cases, population entirely unmasked UK. New England, plenty mask mandates. people wholly abandon mitigation, done UK, case load worsen, even areas higher vaccination, winter.

I'm well aware vaccination rates places. live Rhode Island, I'm currently UK. I'm ""super cautious"" fact alone demonstrates, came see parents 2 years, 3 month old 4 year old. 

The reason Delta worse UK vs initially dumb luck timing. There's chance areas currently also slightly higher natural immunity well, AZ vaccine less effective.

But, I've seen, stark difference behavioral. one place 1% people wearing masks. other, many times are, including mandate. So, socially it, thankfully. imagine change pediatric vaccinations. 

Your idea Delta wave believe follow pattern similar previous waves rather ignores UK NOW. need think differences restrictions lifted, Delta began. 

You believe Delta months long plateau UK rising second peak, Northeast, vaccination rates couple percentage points higher there? Ok. verdad nowhere near brink right now?

Very little difference summer. interesting see word final guidance later tonight. Like J&amp;J going say ""we recommend get J&amp;J booster one available Pfizer/Moderna perfectly fine"" say opposite recommend everyone got J&amp;J get mRNA booster available?  permanent, ending date arbitrarily selected, logical end dates already passed, logical end dates never happen COVID endemic us permanently large percent people never get vaccinated, even less get booster shots.

Just tested positive.

Symptoms far congestion, fatigue, slight fever (99.5), mild cough.

Day 3 symptoms. 1st day mild congestion, thought allergies changing weather. Day 2 low grade fever others.

Hopefully stay mild.  still lot unvaccinated people Oregon. mean title.

Fully vaccinated people must self-isolate develop symptoms go PCR test. they're positive, live need to. Overwhelmed lack beds available. happened places Delta USA.  Hospitals always packed country's healthcare system is, almost nowhere USA ran beds Delta. places made news. basically everywhere see news, run beds.

Correct, vaccine mandate would accomplish far mask mandate.  Would support long I'd support mask mandate far effective day burdon kids like mask mandate is. angle, vaccine mandates win wins mask mandates. really messed polls show people support mask mandates vaccine mandates. people supporting clearly inferior burdonsome option. People make sense.  Covid concern prior vaccines. vaccines vaccinated, care get it. fact, expect get point. happens really matter all.

Yes, lost couple friends family member covid. indeed sad, also lost friends family traffic accidents, stop driving.

I think Wollensky's right override them, would issue guidance data it? (according CDC data Pfizer meeting still now) worries, ""Delta Plus"" variant UK time Christmas.   OP, third shot similar second, even milder side effects. Slight headache slight fatigue. General feeling malaise 24 hours. Went back work (bartending) 2 days later felt fine, even busy bar job.

Do source that? Hospitals area overwhelmed 2020 2021 (and still are). Many delta variant articles areas get overwhelmed 2020 _did_ 2021, vice versa (eg. NYC).

Either way, end-game country-wide vaccine mandates public schools. already many less-dangerous diseases COVID. matter when, if.

Isn’t Singapore going exactly Israel went through? one first mass inoculation campaign, largely using Pfizer Pfizer’s protection wanes Delta needs least another booster.   Same. add flu shot. understanding would diluted drawn can't seem find article anywhere driving nuts must deleted things changed.

That existing practice Pfizer 0.3ml / 30 mcg adult dose.  vial shipped Pfizer contains 0.45 ml concentrated vaccine, need add 1.8ml saline dilute drawing doses.

see page 6 of:  Interesting, yea wait see. I. Don't. Know. 😬 thanks vaccines antivirals COVID reduced mild nuisance

It feel way. point anyway. Ok go.   full circle unfortunately. Misinformation leads people getting vaccinated taking precautions. people die leave kids (horrible story). misinformation picks pushes 'false news' keep politicizing pandemic.  retail pay $19 per hour definitely get rich retail. I'm Irish, know situation well. said briefing yesterday. Correct. Also Russia super low vaccination rate.  Yeah, friend's dad stuck China lockdown come here. kept going serious really think it. incident everyone going big night said happened. Week later lockdown.   vote 9-6 favor including 18-49 underlying health conditions; 6-9 including occupational risk, back Pfizer vote.

So nearly unanimous; since FDA VRBPAC was, totality experts were, Wollensky right override them. shockingly irresponsible 9. say even though *can* stop mild moderate infections, tremendous value individuals public health, we're going overrule FDA disallow people even though there's mass disobedience already... bullshit. 64yo getting covid coughed face day allowed one, 18yo one pound overweight should? disgrace.

But nearly everyone qualifies now. See replies comment we're talking that. Cases matter vaccinated population. mandates unreasonable unnecessary. discontinued already. Link? see article. what? lead weird archive sec's website? I'm confused Yeah that’s true. Didn’t think way. Yep.

Delta fill Floridians now.

Anyone die fresh immunity right now.    society cannot survive constant state emergency fear. need drop move forward deal fallout. solution already become costly problem. cannot keep going back.  Florida back date cases too? way numbers always look better? Hon Déise.

And county city.  uptake high, assumed cases happening among vaccinate.  We've made political. longer helps not. showing membership.  age groups equally. much fewer people requiring hospitalisation vaccination. many people large companies don’t make much money. Cleaning staff. Reception. Mailroom. Etc. work office dealing materials require us present person, every single person claimed vaccinated anonymous survey.

We still wear masks interfere ability work decreases chance breakthrough case would rather make small sacrifice risk prolonging pandemic, making friends family sick.  think anything going happen all, ok.  also Delta 235% likely put hospital. (compared vanilla covid) 

so vaccine saved town much worse.   That's hour Florida  That’s 1 5000 people still hospitalized though. obviously 50k didn’t catch time. even argued fourth covid (which huge stretch) would 1 1250 catch covid vaccination end hospitalized. 

So likely would much higher odds. Why, masks free easy offer protection?  YES, everyone should, there's covid! hard grasp??? schools. combined. fire  observe concept QR codes good, however, unlike Germany France, checks codes lax resist still given lot opportunities. Especially problem is, besides bible belt surrounds western urban region (Randstad), many people refuse taking responsibility they're ill, regardless test results. Trains campus full contagious cases moment.  arrest anti vax, deniers etc.

Lol get grip. I’d rather arrested suggesting something stupid. 

You know ridiculous memes comparing covid Jewish persecution? Well arresting people left right make ridiculous depressingly accurate. Ahh, see. discouraging Moderna specifically, asking would pass another Pfizer shot Moderna booster Pfizer numbers look promising?

Makes sense. I'm sure we'll continue learn dosage, schedule, potential benefits mixing, seems like two incredibly similar. guess, surrounding counties high vaccination rates too.   doubtful definitely one avoid. 

Here NIH study masks surgery: admit, surprised one find hard believe. Covid-19 #2 causes death September, actually broke individual disesases, rather using umbrella terms, like ""Heart Disease"" ""cancer"" would far away #1 cause death. still beat cancer whole.

source: really hard wear mask sure people complaining year+. think teaches medical schools? work school, healthcare, childcare, grocery stores — qualify get booster way. It’s loose guideline. Pretty much 2 island nations. isn't, know Pfizer booster 95% effective getting booster. good enough risk profile. wife back work shanghai **april 2020** Two studies — one published Nature Reviews Microbiology September currently review — show one four flu viruses infect humans year detected anywhere world since April 2020.

Probably all, some. wish I'd discovered pandemic. prescient along. cases covid people wanted brexit same.  ever heard conscientious objectors? That's strongly connected statement faith (often tied religion) particular action allows specific things, legally.

The rules laws abused anti-vaxxers, definitely remain. vaccinated mean GET virus, means body knows KICK BUTT.

Well, exactly. Originally clinical trials Pfizer Moderna showed 94-95% effectiveness *against infection.* means no, get virus.

Now numbers significantly lower.

You're still unlikely become seriously ill, that's good, vaccines preventing infection numbers hoped, means herd immunity harder achieve. Wow. Psychopath. 3rd doses applicable someone immunocompromised took mRNA vaccine. think mix-and-match relevant booster category. unless someone falls narrow definition (like taking medication reduces functioning immune system), dose booster matter type choose. Amazing dismiss vaccine backed supported millions scientists health professionals.

Yet take horse dewormer, backed supported websites also articles bigfoot sightings 5G link us AI mainframe. pretty much laid vaccine hesitant people's fears getting shot early on. know anything long term still don't. three shots moderna me. got first two shots late march/early April. keep doing. sir, thought said Irish :p Vaccination isn’t condom body.  look phase two data, 50mcg doses Moderna effective 100mcg doses. didn’t dose properly initially. dig paper Nature actually think half dose sufficient.   ""The National Institute Public Health Environment (RIVM) registered 4,024 new coronavirus cases per day past seven days. week ago, weekly average stood 2,927 new cases per day."" Sound like it. Herd immunity requires obedient herd doesn’t like going bars. instead would international Chinese tourists forced travel within China, resulting propping tourism industry.

Only don't, occasional outbreaks pop subsequent aggressive zero covid policies force businesses close millions people either stay home change plans, turn results continuous disruptions tourism industry general climate uncertainty bode well sector. mean, hardly encouraged plan trip knew could cancelled minute one single covid case. fact, Chinese traveling far less 2019, latest Delta outbreaks July onwards hell industry: Western tourism sector recovered better we're longer giving much fuck least past summer nearly identical 2019 terms freedoms travel. Why? buy Apple great hardware, MacOS, iOS iPadOS. 

Anything cheap bracket listed probably running windows that's hard pass even look hardware specs.  No, know half dose would less effective full dose. hypothesis, know certain. We're also talking boosters base vaccines.

Immunity asymptotic reaching 100% point matter cut dose original. Further, apparent efficacy close Pfizer Moderna. Parts were, potentially initial immunity, appear lasting secondary immunity. subject daily tests, retail still tested 3 times week, tests home. (Apple gives out). self report get positive result.

They swabbing people en-mass come work. could see tourism industry inside China right now... absolutely booming.

No    thread really weird read seems like everyone forgetting covid isnt gone? like yeah wearing masks kinda sucks especially kids there’s literally much evidence proving still spread virus even you’re vaccinated… don’t want another lock down, don’t think anyone else either, need still wearing masks, especially kids school. sucks, option. 10 people 50,000?

Fingers crossed hoping easy experience without many questions pharmacy. Yes since deaths mostly preventable point. Glad one noticed 😂 too! I'm invested I'll follow days see went. True. half dose Moderna. see study, makes think authorized without testing. Immunosuppression narrow, may interfere vaccine (and thus reason delay), necessarily affect one's life day-to-day. [As old joke goes, ""The thing is, immune system Awesome. Thanks details perspective.  I'm assuming scheduled online. 

Glad fully vaccinated boostered well! safe great weekend! problem vax efficacy infection (80% goes down) Delta variant's HIT (88% assuming R0=8). assuming everyone vaxxed, Delta's R0 high 1.6 **everyone** vaxxed measures followed. even higher immunity waning.

To reach true herd immunity (if ever one), find way improve immunity adjust virus spreading factor it. could happen by

- deploying third doses get insane efficacy (not known long though)
- letting virus go population ""improve"" herd immunity hybrid immunity
- enforcing non-pharmaceutical measures lower virus' R. may using masks, getting contact tracing done right, restrictions mass gathering, etc. say data tells us    true. Stress causes people crazy things. Believe crazy things disbelieve sane things. I'm wondering might gotten vaccine early enough losing effectiveness. 

Also people getting comfortable taking less precautions false sense security. Protection infection really point. Protection symptomatic infection, serious infection, hospitalization, death is.

To give overused analogy... wear seat belt stop crashing; wear die crash.

Further, eliminating infection initial goal COVID vaccines (although fortunate byproduct amazingly effective vaccines are), since human immune system really work way types virus. Circulating antibodies decrease time vaccine primes immune system creation memory T/B cells fight infection occur.  hell happening Romania Serbia? Yes, low vaccination rates, also true couple months ago daily case numbers tiny. people figure let guard down?  think thinking Parkland. That's incorrect. Agreed—I’d like Moderna booster (or ideally third dose). haven’t heard two compare (Moderna half dose Pfizer third dose).  stupid. kids die lightning 18 Covid… lease California I'm confident find way tomorrow! 
I usual sore arm body aches, definitely mild second dose. work ID hand case questioned me, one asked qualified. point. can't fix stupid. Maybe related new deaths counted previously Yeah know quarantine measures arent joke. lay others know taking covid seriously looks like. Dude, computers suck shit time
 backups. Huge! feel getting closer relative end consistent themselves, else they'd admit wrong that's hit people seem able handle.

Decades ""I courage &amp; strength convictions"" stark detail. NIH study Moderna booster used full adult primary dose (100 mcg) rather approved booster dose (50 mcg).

Not ideal ""test use"" standpoint probably make enough difference actually matter.. trying cause offense. vaccine also doesn’t prevent getting makes less likely severe hospitalization. 

The scientific papers I’ve read J&amp;J drops way faster others due “one shot” approach. I’m saying would prefer one choice based I’ve seen. many actions shall see! get headaches often mine. 

I get Hemiplegic Migraines along silent migraines, get different types typical migraines. neurologist said might beneficial try J&amp;J. second dose Pfizer first hemiplegic migraine 6 years.  don’t care. Covid isn’t going anywhere, even get transmission low, we’ll still periodically encountering throughout lives. I’m living forever like this.  No, that’s BS. go cases we’ll always going back forth cleared take mask told month later need mask up, like happened May. state highly vaxxed never brought mask back May, hospitalizations deaths fine, despite “a high spread area”. high spread area post vaccine world *is same* prevaccine world, need start punishing insist is. Sometimes, things happen? I'd rather someone go late number two all. leave internet sling mud live schools closed 18 months. mental health problem students, development delayed extent take years recover. see media fanning flames fear cases schools.

The number permanently closed businesses alarming. unnecessary.

Like said, need done mandates. would favor legislation make kind response impossible ever again. mean, that's true. Oregon decidedly progressive states like Texas Florida. Computer error? Computers don’t make mistakes, people using do. It’s actually closer one week booster. went funeral six people got COVID, one vaxxed, one jnj, rest moderna. 

You could play game days. literally said lawyers fine. Sure sick sucks, that’s always reoccurring part life. Covid always lower danger vaccinated never would made huge deal it, still completely restructuring lives avoid it. end? answer besides “when Covid over”. get keep harping reducing risk hospitalisation death, that's ends. Vaxxed likely transmit they're less likely immobile, infection rates better age groups low -66% some.

Stay healthy good evening. aware much people immunity last July right ? Florida already caught fudging numbers.  Sounds like reference cases myocarditis pericarditis reported happening days 2nd dose mRNA vaccines.  Numbers vary affecting ballpark 1 10,000 males 30, much less women older men.  frequent enough worrying (as cases involved hospitalization) infrequent enough turn clinical trials.

There speculation chance happening reduced longer interval doses.

Preliminary booster data Israel suggested happening somewhat lower rate 3rd dose.  vaccinated. They'd get lot respect world owning came WIV. countries invested research. Sterilizing immunity would mean worry infecting infant. would mean anyone vaccinated could forget entirely. Sadly bet lot schools going try bargain antivaxxers wait full BLA comes instead EUA, even though, matter many times people repeat antivax myth otherwise, there's legal requirement. says hospitalizations highest rate record right article. No, I'm late 30s possibly getting one next week work. I'll let know went  figured yet, zombies. J&amp;J #1, currently schedule Moderna booster Walgreens officially. first thing morning tomorrow. 


I've heard good results mix match far, I'm willing go it. disease still infects vaccinated.  Yep. concerned “too many boosters” take look childhood vaccine schedules. None one done. Several require 3-5 doses. I’m sure you’re saying. 10 people isn’t great it’s highest admission they’ve ever had. mean vaccine “kicking COVID’s butt”? Seems like opposite. coworker told bombarded much ""vaccine information"" know believe unplug. used live china offered mrna vaccine months ago old international health clinic (near shanghai). dont go anymore surprised offered it! think said 'European' mrna message? i'm sure obtained lol good better CDC saying mask mask mask on. future-proofing getting towards 80%-90% plus vaccination rate take long time. even possible. Nicki Minaj's cousin's friend weighed yet? always mask little longer people. Vaccines effective route getting done this. need benchmark. Idk I'm sociopath something, idc happens long everyone chance get vaccinated. Look much damage restrictions already people's mental health economy. We're gonna keep much longer?   Unfortunately soon Delta hit shores, game over. Lockdowns thing past need get vax rates sky high. tried. anti-vaxxers, need give little chance getting others infected via vax pass whatnot. Guess heard Oracle. Probably something around Israel K haha. saw headline thought “this typical Reddit, misleading headlines. surgeon general Florida actually argue vaccines.” read article. Holy fuck. totally did. unbelievable. shit show. That's already happening. virus get point can't transmit lol. even eradicate Spanish flu.. Yeah it. I’m done. 

The people overly anxious need therapy. even trying rude/mean. Stupidity threat humanity. would really suck frontline worker deal this. can't judge book cover lancet study -
“Effectiveness infection”

“For fully vaccinated individuals, effectiveness SARS-CoV-2 infections 73% (95% CI 72–74) COVID-19-related hospital admissions 90% (89–92). Effectiveness infections declined 88% (95% CI 86–89) first month full vaccination 47% (43–51) 5 months. Among sequenced infections, vaccine effectiveness infections delta variant high first month full vaccination (93% [95% CI 85–97]) declined 53% [39–65] 4 months.”

This article Craig Spencer - director global health (emergency medicine) NY also makes point ......? That’s really true. issue vaccine time antibodies go away. leaves us vulnerable infection. t-cells still remember virus. begin producing antibodies fight virus. That’s seeing infection resistance diminish time, hospitalization severe case rates largely staying moderna Pfizer. new strains really changing much vaccines even delay detection bit longer. seeing things like regularly sub.

I would curious see people's social media anti-vax. Wow that's generous October 31st gig. Probably not. Moderna always shown best one. article misleading give enough information. info variants vaccine number lumped together, drilled enough locations. could lot aspects article cover.   love logical naming scheme. Sure hell beats trying call strain location first sequenced. reason think that's would could happen? N95 wish vaccine prevented getting first place. didn't. Quick question... studying original vaccine third dose scenario new formulation mRNA geared towards variants? specifics office don’t matter. He’s saying offices state mask law.  bet lot often go bar work mask lol whole thing absolutely idiotic point exact thing happen last year? numbers climb summer south drop fall increase north got colder high numbers winter colder parts country?  People ignore N95 masks protect wearer. Hate say it, people want need extra cautious it’s point. Also, anyone acquaintances, friends, family members antivaxxers, highly suggest cut ties them. 'ex rampant antivax, told go hell. ""cannot receive vaccine"". wording, mine. get point though. put another way 67.5% deaths came less 15% population. didn’t use word contraindication specifically mean contraindication. Florida county has. Vaccination rates went up, mask ordinances got stricter. two shots Moderna, wondering reason get booster something else instead third Moderna.  HEY! things saying make feel angry! HOAX! I'm outraged! trying make feel bad get stupid libs vax. I'm falling trick!! Nice try! Again, point care idiots. want take part this, fine, problem. shed single tear ones prolonging shitshow, bye bye covidiots. I'd curious rate higher Ed is. boss telling young elementary school kids. spoke teacher pretty much kids screwed way. I’m sure it’ll long term, minimum almost developmentally stunted. Yes, apparently adults, like vaccines. Eventually many, many months later approved children. Let's wait Pfizer's comes. Nope  Ah bummer. able book Moderna booster MN  action? Mask little bit longer, take cautions, vaccinate haven't, lower cases much more, lower, lower, lower virus chance transmitting. many people world gotten boat defeating pandemic.

Had people done part, pandemic would ended much earlier, still almost 2022 still going going going... point, true simply ratio vaccinated unvaccinated high low odds infection large population result cases absolute terms cases large odds small one.

Doesn't mean vaccines work way, almost certainly would require major public health interventions manage. However, certain antivaxxer crowd jump stat make absurd claims vaccines work causing spread bullshit. buckle in, suspect last months coming pandemic probably make folks froth mouth ever. level risk use totally arbitrary. north east west coast red it’s low it’s ever going get. Undercounted deaths covid surprise one looking surplus deaths last 2 years.  guy looked fairly healthy. No. prevents disease infection. biggest disservice public lack consistent ""COVID19 disease, Sars-cov2 virus"" messaging amongst non-scientific media.

It *never* 95% effective infection 95% effective serious disease, confabulate two getting wrong since prelim studies released. 

All vaccines this- covid vaccines special regard. yeah walgreens showing cvs walgreens moderna november. im waiting see cvs options are. announcement cdc probably slamming sites. know, 40% give take people get infected end measurable immunity according CDC. Infection guarantee immunity.   Shit, get dtap 3 times age 6 months. immunocompromisrd get vaccine help bodies can't part. technically go get shot &amp; avoid daily testing. thanks. still go bars eat restaurants like 3 times week. willing take money regardless status. literally want people get covid get expensive, experimental Regeneron treatment instead. I'm sure there's possibly dozens people true belief avoid modern medicines, cosmetics, mouthwash, coffee creamer, etc tested fetal cell lines people get religious exemption since belief sincere excuse making. currency? US, iPad starts $329, Mac mini M1 starts $699, MacBook Air M1 starts $999. Prices ~10% lower education discount. I’m sure Windows computer would give comparable features performance price range. Bidens order Vax test... Americans still fight mask.lmao honestly couldn’t imagine loving kids enough get vaccinated them, only. That’s reason enough, regardless anything else. Check Walgreens, able book booster. everyone getting vaccine misinformation! people getting true fear vaccines, true fear needles, true fear leaving homes, true fear _______ (just fill blank). also people legitimate health concerns, diagnosed allergies, etc. people responsible people, spreading mistruths lies. Lots also working issues trying make lives health better. No, show hate towards them. would we? trying best ability.

And people show great anger towards others living lives! argue, spread hatred, misinformation violent! supposed feel people? bad enough protect many different levels people. come empathy understanding acting like are, getting sick dying? I'm sure time energy this. People makes ""system"" come spreading conspiracy theories, lies mistruths.

People need held responsible actions ever! people stepping great job. regularly them. people protesting, yelling, complaining, lying blaming others much about. need less build upon positive message!

We this!  Also, highly cited paper topic, though addresses residents medical students, population skews younger (and presumably holds less beliefs): That's fine. one forcing eat inside restaurants. take go grocery store. trolling? serious statement? Let know Apple makes phone costs $200 computer $1000.  Utterly tragic, people cold?

People ideology sociopaths often not. Sadly, one survivors Sandy Hook deal dad thinking hoax. wawa waaa deep drilling happen? (asking friend) system can’t avoid destroying itself, worth having? it’s going destroy itself, good try stop it? slide 33 presentation shows post-dose 1/2/3 myo/pericarditis stats Israel. Looks small measurable me.
They observed zero cases women 3rd dose.

In young males, 1/3 rate dose 2, little higher rate dose 1.  older males, post-dose 3 rate lower dose 1.  Well that's true unfortunately. That's one reasons treatments developed, protect inmunocompromised. would highly suggest people wanted access treatment, prove vaccinated first, people take jab first.  acknowledge death would admit wrong something. people would rather burn home family admit wrong.  lol time country take Covid denialism seriously rampant alarming already threat countries well stability.

Time arrest anti vax, deniers etc.

The pandemic yet wont aslong people keep spreading missinfo virus self.

Jesus Christ many people need get sick worst die? 

How many orphans.

Guys Batman. Agree point. fucks still damage *can't* (not won't) get vaccinated. Exactly, feel rude all, feel totally justified calling stuff makes world better. problem want behave awfully, believe wrong all. fire goes runs flammable material.

So virus. still there, smoldering. 

Also, seems local COVID epidemics roughly 2 month surge cycles. numbers drop fast. think part due human behavior (taking precautions height crest), partly due immunity, partly weather, partly virus variants probably bunch factors well. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Doesn’t sound high me. state 1k hospital moment, 5m residents, 1:5000 - we’ve lockdown last 3+ months, literally opening today. (Melbourne, Australia).

110 deaths makes covid total kill rate around 1:400, presumably great deal happened pre vaccination like everywhere else world.

Yeah it’s 2019, it’s long way 2020 True. given 30 ug dose Pfizer nearly effective 100 ug dose Moderna, follow Moderna halved Pfizer would come top? J&amp;J, scheduled moderna booster sunday!  Mandatory quarantine works ways. foreign tourists coming China quarantine, flip side Chinese tourists traveling internationally, also would quarantine like 3 weeks get back. instead would international Chinese tourists forced travel within China, resulting propping tourism industry.

Regarding supply chain, zero covid strategy kept Chinese factories running full capacity throughout pandemic due lack outbreaks. might short disruption due small local outbreaks, general, vast majority factories operate normal. International supply chains already strained, imagine would occur China suffered India scale outbreak rips major urban centers simultaneously. entire western world would cancel Christmas massive factory disruptions within largest manufacturing nation world. understand 50 ug Moderna half dose still larger 30 ug Pfizer “full” dose, right?  Yep, lie, call out. move goal posts lie again, call out. Studies showing Moderna offered better protection Delta, seems like safe bet stick dose three. I'm also ""Team Moderna"" plan staying booster. 40,000 people town? That’s lot. think guidance complete yet.

Apple say: get vaccine get fired. get vaccine get testing. choose quit, quit. 

Apple, unlike companies, gave workers out. want vaccine, get testing. companies are: get vaccine day get fired. Flu back, ain't goin' anywhere. act like that, them, admitted stories real means danger. could sick, could die, could lose loved ones, could leave kids orphans, scares much choose believe it’s fake. think sat able get truly honest would admit they’re scared. Yes, get either. would lie someone dead? It'd perverse imagine taking plot movie Care Lot, using get people declared mentally incompetent forcibly get vaccinated.  Also women plays lead god horrifyingly adept portraying creepy psycho Monkey see... Monkey do... Idiot follows idiot... Get damn shot already! Ah see game playing here.  Fully motivated politics.

Basically previously qualified Phase 1A 1B, eligible.

If young, healthy, work home, likely qualify yet. Finally, taking forever Iirc, quite lot Russian speakers Latvia, there?  good luck rando bat vs pride east cost. BIG RED LOBSTER coming you. haha joke. that's REPORT. wonder real number like DESPITE signs overall epidemiological situation improving, coronavirus continuing spread alarming rate among unvaccinated Finland, according Finnish Institute Health Welfare (THL) Ministry Social Affairs Health. 
 
The incidence infections presently 700 per 100,000 unvaccinated 138 per 100,000 entire clue, percentage medical workers vaccinated not. Vaccines enough curb disease. provide good protection vulnerable, don’t prevent transmission need stop acting like do; confuses people. That’s vaccine mandates dysfunctional — creates impression vaxx controls transmission, evidence overwhelming doesn’t, regardless messaging around “vaxx keep neighbors safe.”

If want control transmission, best bet right it’s long been: regular testing, social distancing, masking. 

Vaxxes must risk bad case COVID, it’s time decisively move idea prevent transmission; idea bad good, vaxxed people AREN’T distancing, masking, getting tested, think isn’t necessary. is. remove stress pandemic mode, pandemic, means others face shorter life expectancy, you, stress work loss loved ones. 

Sure. problem.

I appreciate different view points, however people’s health comes first. Excellent, great job! new generation hope IDGAF, got flu shot    China failed zero CoVID?

It managed contain end every new outbreak far, likely successfully contain latest outbreak well. package epidemic control measures - contact-tracing, mass testing, quarantine isolation, targeted lockdowns - proven highly effective. agree you, experienced people 3 mRNA shots completely it, high blood pressure, skin reactions days shot, exhaustion and/or brain fog. people mix match experience milder symptoms That's nice things. 46k deaths completely impossible. Excess mortality studies point 4500 pneumonia deaths, serological studies show percent people Wuhan ever caught virus. Outside Hubei province, serological studies show basically 0% population infected. serology, excess pneumonia deaths official death toll paint similar picture.

The original outbreak mostly limited Wuhan surrounding areas, lockdowns began late January 2020 eliminated virus China. weeks early 2020, outbreak bad *in Wuhan* nearby cities, rest China never major outbreak. That's China's numbers low. Okay, got J&amp;J April 7, I'm glad letting us mix match  vaccinated allowed go bars here. Running victims stage wave? second option also really possible Ireland many people live parents. confirm AZ trial get text every Monday. Immediately short list (fever, shortness breath, difficulty breathing) two days longer list (coughing, headaches, loss taste/smell, etc). Honestly, really bad, doubt would wanted die real, seem like thinking adaptive person. places seem adapted restrictions actually fun ways. rooftop movies, lots new delivery services, park concerts, live-streamed theater, etc. closed streets businesses could outdoor dining, well liked they’re keeping it. work successful WFH we’re using hybrid schedule now, honestly love it. never though I’d get kind flexibility. 

Again, wasn’t sunshine rainbows anything, people strong. said, whole thing communication policy nightmare, especially comes schools. schools best could, left scrambling trying set remote school food impoverished communities without access tech transportation. hope see exposed issues fix good also coming this. It’s less apparent right now.

I think it’s easy talk abstract “cost-benefit analysis” imagine price paid people. don’t think lightly talk essentially rolling dice people’s lives condemning horrific death, particularly alternative literally piece cloth. We’re better that. Delta.

Practically 100% adults town wider county fully vaccinated. established. Redditor fit curve several days data, claimed proved data fake. prove anything, OP capable fitting curve data.

The official death count China subsequently validated studies excess mortality serological studies. death toll accurate death toll Western country.  get makes difference.  biggest question mind right now, besides soon ages children vaccinated, eventually need boosters too. Yeah opening properly I’m seeing less less people masks… No. We've already exceeded mortality level 90s. current mortality Russia highest ever recorded peacetime.   LOL it’s internet- actual doctors making fake entries database Thing is, Finland currently 80% rate full vaccination adults (87% one dose, meaning still growing). guess, rate vaccination health care 90% likely even 95+%, making mandatory part moot. 

So, combative language sake combative, undermining excellent communication strategy pandemic led low death rates. Germany Italy took seriously Netherlands people general behave better there. It’s less budget issue moving money away important things into, let’s say, spirituality-based programs loss expertise. lot people quit fired, replaced sycophants positions left empty. case USDA, even straight moved Washington said could hire Kansas City locals National HQ, like kind knowledge experience would magically spring up.

Sounds like recipe producing new variants me.

Just get vaccinated. Yeah, idk even thing. wife nurse, specifically pediatric oncology. She’s always get flu shot every year get vaccine early possible ( back January). you’re around people comprised immune systems, protecting you, also them. Yes. Current clinical evidence shows COVID-19 vaccination protects severe symptoms disease also important tool decrease spread virus rate infection. googled sentence one first results.

That's entirely correct. know antibodies levels time. We're still learning effective vaccination plan make sure efficacy remain high.

However, know vaccine/booster cause unwanted responses side effects, surely say remain safe use.   agree constantly putting scaremongering articles bad desensitises people, always scary news = views. Media gonna media guess. seems like actually think pandemic over. surprise. taking us breeding new variants.  tottally fine. issue took RIGHT getting vaccination even questionable. far apart problem. care protection infection, aside J&amp;J, none vaccines showed waning severe disease hospitalization delta variant. take booster now, long antibodies wane?

Seems weird support yet knowing risks noone unless busy bus, train airport.  ""It's rebranded ivermectin"" seems line they've settled talking about: vaccines work making u less sick, still get infected transmit practically same, lagic unvaxxed home, supposedly sick, immobile, less chance spread others out, whereas vaxxed spread absolute f*ck outta cause knocked home. AKA super spreaders.

However also agree unvaxxed mobile anyway (given They're allowed fuckin house begin with), majority infections asymptomatic begin with.

NEW YORK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Pfizer (PFE.N)/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine showed 90.7% efficacy coronavirus clinical trial children 5 11 years old, U.S. drugmaker said Friday. 
 
Sixteen children trial received placebo got COVID-19, compared 3 vaccinated, Pfizer said briefing documents submitted U.S. Food Drug Administration. 
 
Because twice many children 2,268-participant trial given vaccine placebo, equates better 90% efficacy.

Children either much less likely get infected transmit transmission take place school.

Eradication completely unrealistic expectation people stop going gives ammunition anti-vaxxers. context (from article), 69% Greeks vaccinated. vaccines work, we'd expect 31% intubated patients unvaccinated. That's Delta. I'm getting can't let virus keep spreading mutating something even worse comes through. fewer people actively spreading Covid around, nip mutations bud much quickly.  Anecdotal evidence, admit, I've done weekly trip supermarket today almost everyone masked. comparison wearing masks steadily diminishing previously. read local (non-Russian) media, vaccination rate stuck 30% many distrusting Sputnik also complying health protocols. purpose article serve rile headline only, antivaxx loonies Ivermectin Nobel prize medicine humans, disingenuous call horse dewormer. Dogs take antibiotics, mean amoxicillin pet medicine? data spread within fully vaccinated cohorts. already know 4-6 months, infection significantly drops. think about, 6 months 50% protection infection, going achieve herd immunity. Someone familiar math drop formula us. know parameters R0 Delta, infection. fuck getting this. Locking people stated nowhere article.  anybody know recommended months getting second dose getting booster? received Pfizer. letting mutate continue infect people without setting restrictions mask mandates, severity situation intensify. Waiting ‘do something it’ absurd policy, literally creating conditions severity. There’s reason there’s specific field study this: epidemiology. Rather randos sharing theories. UK choosing randos epidemiologists. Sad state affairs   Hospital admissions deaths low, that’s vaccine made for. Natural immunity also increasing proven scientific studies strong. see unvaccinated gaining natural immunity vaccinated getting dual immunity, deaths hospital numbers remain low, what’s big deal? government clearly knows financially cannot take anymore lockdowns, huge amounts money spent vaccine shows good results. keep scaring people articles like this? anything shown proof vaccination natural immunity working. That's unfortunate that's literally point public health I’m boat got full 3rd Moderna shot Sept True, almost nothing fact results evident throughout whole pandemic. even worse. sanitizing streets, roads, outdoor stairs. ""The government must something"". Yeah, *something*. Give brand name ""Ivermecto"".

Problem solved. Singapore also 3rd densest country world one lowest infection rates prior wave population able travel recently.

It's fair comparison average person lives block hundreds people sharing lifts vs countries live Well, help understand Biden, CDC Fauci's fault people taking news jackass twitter rather official sources?? many stubborn people aswell. like matter I'm vaccinated anyway, transmit decease vaccinated person, get sick anyway.... side effect reading article. sides hurt laughing did. stupidity people boundless. pre-vaccine widespread availability position too. 
Now I'm understanding it, Covid going anywhere, become endemic, *everyone* get Covid someday.

So stat concern country's high vaccination rates cases, hospitalizations deaths.

I'm gonna bet they're relatively low. Thanks crusading issue. need like pursuit holy grail! everyone vaccinated reduces severity infections, become like common cold, nearly one dying hospitalized, move on? list symptoms need get PCR test rubbish (at least UK) young friends caught delta agree worst Symptom bad headache even list! don't, people making conclusive statements topic jurisdiction vaccinated 12 group talking ass. simple answer know things stand herd immunity. 2 cents, complete layman, degree something completely unrelated subject hand. become clear me, Israel, real way **presently** continue maintaining really high levels antibodies. That's it, stand today, that's way out. (and minions) dead wrong denying boosting cost name equity. Scarcity limiting factor now, withholding boosters way meaningfully change supply around developing world. discussed, beaten death, many many people know. point, call equity cost merely one ""If can't it, can't it, period"". IMHO people blood hands.

It's also extremely disingenuous force feed us hospitalization/death thing matters. We're stupid. understand 90% severe outcomes sky high cases still produces lot bad outcomes.

The doses found effect covid doses found large livestock horses, people taking. large doses toxic humans. it’s disingenuous  picked measles R0 12-18 (varies depending source) delta seems 5-9 (also depending source). like call folks self supremacists I’m aware FDA done part agree it. 

My comments primarily directed people threads chomping bit booster likely don’t meet criteria. 

My point is; aren’t going boost way pandemic, sets vaccines wane protection infection (not severe disease) within months. 

This doesn’t mean vaccines bad, it’s coming reality, included, aren’t miracle cure thought. Furthermore, compared vaccines higher rate complications therefore regular boosters carry risk. 

We need focus getting first series rest world every hasn’t yet, vulnerable boosters, maybe booster general public point. FDA essentially authorized said panels, I’m pointing unsaid parts. 

I’d encourage anyone listen panel discussions, understand boosters can’t do, understand won’t end pandemic boosting every goddamn 6 months eternity. YouGov poll, breakdown results types people asked: Maybe sill using original Pentium infamous divide bug. banning guns? Oh wrote vaccines banned somewhere? Damn, got deeper issues.. .....what? dont understand point youre trying make. Well one truly interesting part amount data research happening across many topics related COVID-19. study published claim attached may research understand claim reached study designed reach conclusion validity. Additionally, may see claim one study dig deeper look counter points too. nothing wrong wanting information.

Hi anyone details research covid olfactory dysfunction? alarming symptom people almost everytime happens. nothing getting talked regarding that? dangerous neurological implications. Anyone know anything it? Looking discuss ask half dose booster full dose? JJ shot already go Moderna booster, getting ""full"" dose half dose booster? hard. Sometimes hard things. Masking w/ high vax rate way keep stumbling toward normal. That's true. clinical trials test everyone, symptoms not. Dutch people never took pandemic seriously.  also expect happen immunity wanes also acquired immunity goes up. population 0% acquired immunity, vaccine appear greater effect population 40% acquired immunity.

Eventually, unvaccinated people contract virus naturally, there's slight difference two populations terms prevention. sure I've heard message meaningful way. I've heard important keep masking infection wanes profound way.

Professionals say yet proven efficacy hospitalizations deaths wanes, maybe early virus continue evolve we'll playing whack-a-mole forever.

Virus mutate evolve independently that, actually. virus change one way another, thing kind changes future. Thanks info! know either mRNA vax better J&amp;J, sure difference enough make worthwhile. poorest people country think exactly freedom, doesn’t shit money. missing point. What's endgame test people find they're immune? vaccinate. stupid say test instead vaccinate accomplish thing. everyone get Covid someday.

Sorry acceptable. Condemning quite large portion population effects long covid something try avoid much possible Hello! got flu shot Tuesday scheduled booster shot Sunday. need space two good? Specifically boosters. question clue answer level circulating antibodies stop effective secondary immune system/memory cells take over.

Lasting circulating antibodies stop infection kind pipe dream, game become risk mitigation. ICU capacity threshold need careful about, yes. that, yes, go lives before, choose to. That's exactly UK doing: even London Underground, masks, social distancing, etc. far NHS handled load.

Science tell us *should* do, merely *is*. SARS-CoV-2 *is* contagious, *is* virus vaccinated casualty rate X, etc. subjective, objective, decision. live we're 90% vaxxed population, indoor mask mandates still force. They've lifted since July 2020 (municipal mandate, provincial).

Other vocal small minority bunch malcontents, people still accept masking distancing necessary. think consistency mask mandates critical; they'd rescinded reimposed masks I'm sure would've blowback resistance.

Testing unfortunately regular. Since vaccination rate high, restrictions placed could get tested; last time partner tried, fully vaccinated runnier nose normal longer elevated temperature morning. partner allowed test symptoms plus cough. Thankfully negative.  Difference minor/minimal. Absolute worst case scenario : get another someday. America 1925 Germany right now.  weird many complaints restaurants representation announced would need check QR codes; said would impact industry negatively. Yet seems effort side anything still complain measures Maybe CDC ounce consistent messaging, government provided consistent messaging especially beginning interim pandemic time - would alot less. honestly them. turn Google know basic things vaccine government could released several ""infomercials"" it? ""Founding Fathers"" undermined idea freedom honesty really trying express. That's asterisk always convenient ignore. interrogate countries real concept freedom continue talking circles see nose face. 

""Freedom whatever heck want expense"" America built on. know this, ignore existence million people believe otherwise. imagine Fauci totally disillusioned humans point. He's probably wondering devoted life helping ungrateful Neanderthals. Like want say deserve die stop whining leave right live dont care dont want vaccine mask I'm tired protests mean then? posting r/guns: ""we ban guns forever""

Me downvote oblivion: ""Ha ! Getting downvoted choice. Oh love reddit""

The ignorance palpable gave opinion 1st admendment. asking experts opinion thought said. talk terms populations, unhelpful speak absolute numbers. rates matter. 10k dead India 10k dead Iceland, eg

We learn live level risk on. 90% efficacy severe disease mean 10% people get covid vaccination hospitalised, means 0.2% people get covid hospitalised - assuming 2% hospitalisation rate unvaccinated. flu numbers. need stop behaving like every single covid death tragedy.

By means get boosted rhe opportunity so. applying boosters every single person every 6 months simply practical. think vaccination rates low now, booster rates even lower.  prefer anti vaccine people get vaccine majority filtered via Darwin.  Judging excess mortality, currently losing 3k day. Similar vaccine moderna higher dose. Also higher reported side effects. You’ll likely protected moderna, Pfizer good too. Going preference much you’re willing wait/seek booster want. That's hard know without real world data total population everyone vaccinated (including kids). ""waning immunity"" really ""the body longer full attention, ready something happen"". However, know truly high vaccination rates viruses lead almost virtual elimination -- people stop vaccinating (think measles vaccination vs outbreaks communities drops 93%)

Will vaccinated people get it? Sure. spread fully vaccinated population different mixed vaccination population (mathematically, cut single exponential multiplier get different result; cut multiple get different result).

Other restrictions, next best thing done limit spread getting many people vaccinated possible. return leaking house: put temporary barriers leaks, best bang buck filling largest crack, monitoring smaller ones.

&amp;#x200B;

\-- Long way saying: unvaccinated huge \*\* leak   Quick question;

What differences three main vaccines (Moderna, Pfizer, J&amp;J)?

I know protect covid; much obvious, stops mixing matching? adverse effects that? like take word freedom synonym anarchy chaos. want freedom....fuck societal constructs laws...a mild inconvenience clearly akin extreme dictatorship known man.

You absolutely point /u/LukeLC heart hearts, I'd love believe many people centrists understand give take society somehow we've started getting dictated extremes sow enough seeds doubt allow stuff like misinformation fighting occur.

I'm honestly loss reverse course moving forward. SAME! excited :)))) Yes avoid vaccine, catch Covid would otherwise avoided (with high total probability), infect someone infected, person dies? someone close infections chain goes on.

I problem people want retain liberty medical treatments. freedom shall come accountability. exactly makes feel right put higher risk people around you? literally drunk driving. freedom valid long hurt others. valid masks too.

Obviously, bad happens even taking necessary precautions, that's unfortunate, way rarer people care, go around infected, unvaccinated without mask face.

Being unvaxxed statistically kills puts people hospital, course, person gets social environments.

But since usually social, viral infections taken individual discourse. Epidemics things get together, individuals decisions.  finite amount shots finite production rate. argument waiting boosters save supply vulnerable exposed, i.e. elderly, immunocompromised patient facing healthcare workers. Also 7 billion people less developed countries, they're white cares eh? everybody liked ._.  read yesterday actually variant that's contagious possibly lethal Delta. thought March 2020 terrifying time.   Agreed. reaching strange point good percentage people believe basic scientific facts, listen doctors, listen government, listen family members, believe entitled assault others that... willing become foot soldiers random internet strangers.

The scary part points people willing commit violence things falsehoods, also completely incapable seeing reason logic. 

Following basic safety protocols, taking safe effective vaccines controversial. Yet are. \*Mind-bottling educated now, got degree Prager U! got J&amp;J originally I'm eligible booster. I've seen people say Moderna better Pfizer, can't find data indicating that. local pharmacy Pfizer available today difference minimal I'm gonna get that.

However, mid-november I'm going flying pretty crowded area pretty busy event (think indoor wedding), 2 young kids home approved vaccination, would hate bring even though plan quarantine 3 days trip.

Got Moderna early March // early April (shots 1//2)

Would it? compared last year, limiting, downward force vaccination competing upward pressure transmissible variant (Delta) generally relaxed mitigation 

I’m sure anyone say reasonable certainty offsetting factors play next months, certainly hopeful impact reduced, it’s imprudent let guard early, stay poised react circumstances dictate 

An old hurricane mantra: plan worst, hope best least adults, Pfizer looked symptomatic cases. would imagine kids same.  Okay thanks. Thanks.  Learning live implies die it. 

I exercise eat healthy foods order avoid cardiovascular disease. abstain smoking, use sunscreen order avoid cancer. wear mask order avoid COVID. wish did, trying asshole here. want pandemic behind us like do. I’m also pro-vaccine questions wisdom boosting general public, like fda, data shows short lived protection infection.

The rising levels concern Colorado stand contrast happening nation large. Across United States, coronavirus cases hospitalizations falling. 
During previous several months, virus’ delta variant tore health care systems around country, Colorado managed lowest hospitalization case rates country. Now, Colorado 10th-highest infection rate 20th-highest hospitalization rate among states, according New York Times’ case tracker.

This ignores prevention infection (very significant) third doses (which appear give near complete protection infection). course ignores untested infections. within age bracket likely half deaths vulnerable majority healthy individuals half average risk.

And trying explain retracted studies whole different ballpark altogether actually super low. 115 deaths yesterday 67 million people. math that's 1 death per 670 thousand. extremely low chance die COVID UK time. pull percentages rather true numbers tell full story. really worth putting restrictions low mortality rate?  predicted exactly next days numbers would be

No, not.

Just take look [the original quadratic fit cumulative confirmed cases 15 consecutive days. decent fit, exact. could repeat procedure 15 days' worth country's data get decent fit. extrapolate fit bit, completely fails predict inflection point leveling Wuhan's confirmed We’ve seen evidences cases earlier China admitted.

The timeline Chinese doctors first noticed something might wrong well established. late December 2019. sent first patient samples tested 24 December, got first results 27 December. outbreak announced publicly 30 December. point, everyone around world pays attention sorts things knew outbreak. get booster I’m *living* someone who’s immunocompromised, I’m myself? need start going office really want minimize odds bringing house. immunocompromised person already third shot. Lol idea still stupid! myself/age/health sure better. family member high risk category (70 autoimmune disease) react pfizer vaccine. study showed 50% study group reactive varied booster, mean one reactive one vaccine other? think arguing point I'm arguing? Nordic countries higher vaccination rates, better healthcare begin with.

I'm suggesting can't get back normal. I'm saying can't continue outstanding anti-vax population pretend like going back normal ill effects.

Sure, hospitals overwhelmed, procedures canceled. since takes often months planning pre-op US, like decide tomorrow continue procedures next week. I'm using hypotheticals here. Many people medical health put hold deal pandemic. show significant drop myocarditis essentially every side effect, reports may keep coming (the youngest age group certainly incomplete; caveat mentioned). Phase 1-3 trials overall shown similar number side effects second dose, strange third dose would lower. Overall I'd say know yet. People want preconceived notions, matter cretinous vile, validated. and, already said, disturbing number people viewing admitting erred sign weakness thus must avoided costs, small wonder listen mentally ill shit stain online researcher says ""you utterly wrong, reasons "" Half dose moderna still larger full Pfizer dose. Yeah, similar logical flaw playing lottery.  Right. vaccine effective preventing death -- COVID 3rd leading cause death England August testament that.

No, somebody runs counter scientific consensus something tried true vaccination, better get bullshit meter ready. Gotcha. That’s still pretty scary esp since humans bad large numbers. 1 200K astronomically small feels like 1 200 lol   Companies want install facilities produce vaccines also want let rich countries donate jabs easily either. guys messed up. Deliberately distorting truth, even done good intentions, never good idea long term, reduces public trust, justifiably so. lied ""for greater good"" mask efficacy start pandemic, one could justified asking whether they're lying ""for greater good"" vaccine efficacy now. Another example: CDC strongly recommending widespread use N95 even KN95 FFP2 masks, they're afraid people might interpret departure original stance cloth masks good enough.

When public agency starts issuing guidelines based scientific judgment based considerations (political otherwise) targeted elicit certain outcome among public, that's lose long-term credibility, certainly mind. CDC's job communicate people, manner easy understand possible, best available scientific information moment. political leaders ordinary citizens information none CDC's business. stated full truth right beginning: ""based prior experience similar diseases, believe masks, ideally N95, might help controlling spread; update communique information becomes available.""

Note: I'm strongly pro-vaccine extent I'm pissed boosters deployed widely. I've seen research trust it, took vaccine read understood research, Fauci's recommendations, trust reasons stated above. Wait month winter wave see.

Source: last year specific anathesia. Leaning towards Pfizer there'll efficacy data (from Israel mostly), we'll know begins wane again. Also, Pfizer booster trial data released yesterday looks pretty impressive.

Still tempted Moderna end lasting longer, worried myocarditis risk I'm male 30.

Tough choice. know, things crazy gets thoughts trapped like bottle? high vaccination rate die vaccinated. 100% vaccinated 100% deaths vaxxed.  like 20 million people 5, like 313 million eligible soon. Wait 1 200K chance specific operation anasthesia general  Agreed responsible that? remember CDC encouraging people use masks last year. media politicized left right. sides ignored political rallies/protests bashed side taking measures covid. ICU measure, one prone scarcity. also one basically every country uses measure issue. operations postponed, doctors would treat diverted ICUs, severe COVID patients go. hospitals overwhelmed, there's relatively treatment delays.

There also costs *not* returning life normal. beer bar actually part normalcy, normalcy part everyone's mental health (bars open almost everywhere anyway). 15% businesses temporarily closed COVID gone forever, affecting livelihoods owners staff, including health insurance ability find care. couple friends field psychology year *brutal* them; turning away patients they're already over-extended.

Normalcy pretty important mental, economic, social wellbeing people. point, severe COVID among vaccinated statistically pretty anomalous. affects mitigation becoming problematic. UK, Spain, Nordic countries returned normalcy dropped mask mandates, dropped social distancing, braving waters uncertainty vaccines protect them. same.

(Full disclosure, I'm expat, country largely returned normal.)   include high school dropout? implies something correct? since research mean 'virology experiments'. Thats narrow view research is.  risk getting small (some people reporting next reaction booster all), benefits outweigh incredibly small costs.

There’s pesky “context” word again.

You pick soundbites make seem like somebody saying anything. conservative media love that. sample size much smaller (around 2,000 participants vs. 40,000 adult trial), there's lot variance. 


The actual number infections 3 vaccinated group vs. 16 placebo group (the vaccinated group twice big placebo group). Change one numbers little bit, changes % number lot. I'm willing bet reason efficacy lower adult trials mixed bag things. Keep mind, trials children ran strictly relying parents' behavior protection, like lockdown, working office setting, eating out, socializing etc. Virtual learning also hardly option now. Life ""normal"" trials running adults. Edit: oh, course transmissible Delta variant.

I'd say clearer picture real-world efficacy compared one adults, almost everyone still strict lockdown much afraid ""live life"". behaviors skewed data adults, I'm saying.

That's educated guess, least guess, would say Fauci probably downplaying effectiveness masks reducing spread virus order keep people gaining false sense comfort going public places. all, point pandemic still didn’t really know infectious was. 

His biggest mistake assuming American public collectively capable rational thought. not. stupidity hubris given life, it’s time us, kids rest insist having, suffer it. Deny it, angry it, flail, cry, wail “rights”, universe doesn’t care. don’t even feel regret anymore; lack empathy display around world last two years freed that. hope it’s good show.  Anyone getting third moderna shot/booster flu shot time? U s. us. giving world impression manageable. Unfortunately countries enjoy amenities do. actually know would look like surge prior vaccine. surge smaller, smaller place even less vaccinated populations. point highly vaccinated examples, lower vaccinated examples look hard see difference.

That's way intended say vaccine nothing. point WAY overblown. People act like getting vaccinated like running around stabbing everyone see knife. Sorry making big difference. money issue? can't alone time? ........rolling eyes...really  ""Ask not..."" Worth what? What's downside reporting trial showed Pfizer vaccine 90% effective infection end first trial endpoint?   ROB 64. Keep good work! Goebbels would killed high rating.

People looking variants Russia, seem anything that's clearly outcompeting. 

Russia lot Eastern Europe good vaccination rates. even need waning hit order Delta spike. 

The UK also experiencing much larger growth infection attributed new variant. I'm willing bet mixed bag things - keep mind, trials children ran strictly relying parents' behavior protection, like lockdown, working office setting, eating out, socializing etc. Virtual learning also hardly option now. Life ""normal"" trials running adults. Edit: oh, course transmissible Delta variant.

I'm getting Moderna booster today wondered ok get flu shot next week? Comment upvote visibility!  Well, that's sort splitting hairs vaccine efficacy vs vaccine effectiveness two categories: disease infection. [They're *A candidate vaccine SARS-CoV-2 might act infection, disease, transmission, vaccine capable reducing elements could contribute disease think logically. covid positive patient sneezes next droplets enter nose, virus enter system. Due vax even viral load low, might diagnosed positive even you’re asymptomatic. bunch asymptomatic ppl technically part 95% number don’t symptoms. vax world stops virus entering system (physically impossible), stops/ limits replicating proper immune response.

I'm arguing you, agree.

I'm suggesting seems likely based available data, *higher viral loads* Delta variant causing vaccines less effective *preventing transmission*, even still effective preventing disease.

That's important distinction understand.

You still get vaccinated, preventing disease great, prepare possibility vaccinated populations necessarily herd immunity transmission. data variants hitting regions? curious could related waning effectiveness new variants.  use spike sequence, different ends sequence.

The antibody levels mix match study shows Moderna booster (full 100ug) providing slightly Pfizer, enough matter much, study small sample size. big difference J&amp;J really work well others booster.

Dr. Fauci consistent guidelines knowledge FDA/CDC including mask policies, positions may evolved new things learned, flip, improvement/evolution global knowledge.

Many people seem think someone says X later flip flopper/liar, true, X may thought true time, learn becomes true.... science.

The medical experts like Fauci scummy politician refuse evolve statements positions presented new info, unlike example Trump sticking election fraud BS, even given mountains proof contrary. Yeah, Swedish, aware this. truly bad. 
But also shows real harm vaccines talked publicized, kept crazy secret many anti vaxxers us believe. 


Sweden, like Southern Europe, combines high vaccination rate high total infection rate. probably quite good shape going forward. No, case waning antibodies bas shown increase cases deaths Israel prior started boosting. worldometers correct calculated actual number 36% fairly accurate guess. Perhaps omitted actual numbers readers wouldn’t jump Simpson’s Paradox bogus conclusion. satellites astronomers recently got glimpse supernova exploding 60 million light-years away earth

despite this, certain could still linked effects ill-advised US government action  comment shows problem: differentiating science politics.

The criticism travel bans came initial ban solely China cases already exploding Europe. made ban China completely ineffective actually needed stop international travel. Many epidemiologists pro mask sounding alarm initial recommendation masks started- solely alleviate ppe shortages medical fields, science based decision. politicians largely cared economy/re-election chances, viral science. ""lockdowns"" (note: US true lockdowns, ""soft"") half hearted loopholes, unable stop spread, slow bit. got moderna booster today 1.5 hours ago. first dose moderna worse side effects second. round feels similar first. Sore arm body feeling heavy weak already.  dismissive want, people reach social end pandemic, guess what, pandemic over. care systems continue intense stress places seeing large outbreaks.

...and vaccines stop issue. places high vaccination rates, Delta surge barely blip hospital systems. hence places things largely back normal since Spring. places without high vax rate, people generally give shit begin with, deaths move needle either way. 

So yes, people done paying attention post-vaccination essentially rampant cold, over. 

You might want look social end pandemics. they're new concept, pandemics tend end way. Get grip. might fewer antibodies now. they’re better ones started with... Antibodies supposed peter out; that’s always do. Still, even antibodies dwindling absolute quantity, scrappy molecules enhancing quality, continuing replace new versions keep improving ability bring virus heel.   Waiting get mine 😭 Yes well I'm trying lose two weeks semester due mandatory quarantine + want give cough antivax mother entire planet still much stricter lockdown putting levels exposure mid 2020 people done 2021.

2. vast majority people never dying pandemic.
3. Health care systems continue intense stress places seeing large outbreaks.

This kindof important literally everything around us based science implemented people research way. Otherwise modern transportation, communication, medicine, even fertilizer grow food.

But guess that's quaint outmoded .... Uncle Bob Facebook definitely knows ""doing research"" thing better college-educated eggheads  Fauci lied congress dont know. particular doctor go country get MD program. convinced fell far proverbial tree.

But also, hopeful, horrible family mother doesnt listen literal doctor child.   90.7 infection, death.

Further, whether give healthy children isn’t clear cut despite this. what’s clear important trial millions kids preexisting conditions (cancer patients, transplanted kids, etc) get vaccine.   Lie? data right here:   event past 20 years can’t traced back USA eventually? Six degrees American bacon   People choose believe BS. Right. reached stage yet covid, matter badly people want case. frees bed someone vaccinated needs medical attention I’m Covid endemic yet, unstable virus (still mutating) still causing epidemic waves around world, definition pandemic.

We wanted vaccines solve this, time acknowledge not. extent, Fauci's accolades part makes lot anti-vaxxers distrust him. He's ""part establishment"" them, reject anything say *because* he's well-respected mainstream. people desperate reject mainstream thinking (in part they've rejected endless onslaught growing inequality), innately distrust him, turn source alternative facts. least we'll Linus fight think needs adapt reality sir. 

The fact places country people dropping dead streets, new reality vaccines make case counts pretty irrelevant longer lead deaths serious complications vast majority people. 

Due that, general sentiment public right *who frickin cares?* 

You absolutely *can* end pandemic ignoring it, especially effects pandemic basically mild illness people. 

In fact I'm ignoring right working cafe without mask. I'll ignoring later today go brewery group friends without mask, I'll definitely ignoring go club 100 people without masks. 

See works? Pandemic over. Sure, seems confidence levels vaccines, respectively, orders magnitude different. covid vaccines first released loads memes making fun mixing different vaccines. standard advice. seems lack confidence vaccines make people cautious *mandating* everyone get them. actually think whole problem tries hard provide simple, concrete answers people, ends cutting way much nuance. think needed stick complex nuanced science, let leaders communicators break simple rules, guidelines, explanations suit people. 

I think lot people take communication granted, breaking complex ideas simplified terms *well* whole skill set unto itself; communication whole field study. New Mexico took shit seriously, drove last November way Wolf Creek, indoor nothing, three people time gas stations, etc. Blame internet. mean is, internet best thing humans ever made also absolute worst. sum total human knowledge available anyone connect use search box amazing incredible. 

It also makes way easy kooks, morons dangerous actors find manipulate raise isolated, crazy intentionally dangerous ideas fever pitch attract participants. used every town one two kooks. kooks easily find other, reinforce delusions, make plans, manipulated know useful army idiots be.

The internet best worst thing we've ever done humans. starting get interesting. doubt ever think actually know happened, getting interesting. seems willing actually acknowledge facts. part science? Lol he's probably likely die ride school  Th emails indicated funded creating chimeric SARS (corona) virus chimeric MERS virus. dont think shows efficacy less adults

this 90% efficacy positive cases, random trial study recently adults, probably around number delta transmissible variant becomes dominant major country, better believe coming near future. Hospital admissions rising fast cases past couple weeks. sure getting overlooked. isn't, still worry though since he's around kids, masks state optional schools little worse situation hate much money time spent proving water wet, convince people refused believe first place current rise England driven largely unvaccinated children sent back school masks. 9/5 10/16 age groups significant increases infection levels [were 2-11 Poopy like diarrhea feeling bad? Sorry wanted clarification. handle garbage collection? think fit, I'll waiting. definitely get quickly qualify though. elaborate significance this? covid tests?   Sputnik likely version stolen AstraZeneca. certainly best vaccine world, probably works. 

But Russia's main problem catastrophic healthcare system low trust towards authorities - low vaccine uptake plenty fake vaccinations. Huh, message changed data came in... sounds exactly like science work. 

And yes vaccines effective. vast majority deaths unvaxxed assholes. Also, anywhere close 70% vaccinated country cunts keep refusing get vaccinated going maskless everywhere like go way work text ahead 2 hours late. people would rather believe easy lie hard truth. anyone said that? projecting different argument made. 

It's entirely possible 3 4 doses standard moving forward, like many vaccines. needed yearly like flu shots. Either way move natural immunity become prevalent, virus circulate like common cold flu minor issues. 

Masks inefficient mediocre stopgap work unless entire community commits regular mask use distancing, need paired together work effectively, that' something vast majority population going accept.  need study this... seems like there's substantial protection infection all, great several reasons even CDC cares much opposed hospitalizations. went got one not. That's said two things. Hospitalization rates continue go people get exposed one way another comment spoke case numbers, hospitalizations.

I found hospitalizations though:  Mainland China contained dozen small Delta outbreaks now. entirely doable right public health response. Sad see someone credentials public health harm words. Sorry husband still in. hope gets released soon. terms used German speaking countries. Ireland, testing never included option. vaccinated recovered people allowed in. Damn right. 

J&amp;J march, getting Moderna sunday.  can’t seriously advocate forcing multiple booster shots forever Stupidity/ignorancr one worlds dangerous diseases.

Imagine world without greedy people power, transphobes/racist people etc.


If people political power we're dumb we'd living happily Masks great non-invasive. Vaccines good can’t boost forever side effects.  really use UK example. government ideologically opposed implementing even basic measures like masks, despite NHS chiefs calling due much pressure under.

Ireland much better example since government hesitate implement restrictions needed, still continuing open despite rising case numbers. fuckin shit? god, implications! already modified vaccination meant general months ago. this? Especially boosters aren’t “officially” recommended general public? wonder everyone confused. Yes sure. People trying make like UK terrible right want go back wearing masks restrictions hospitalisation rates stay low good considering finally got back mostly normal. We're never going able stop people testing positive virus - key preventing serious illness. proposing regular 6 month boosters forever? insanity environment zero tolerance communicable disease, testing vaccinated daily basis viable course action. Vaccinated people believing can’t carriers turns super spreaders.  CVS got morning (originally J&amp;J) Pfizer, straight website. redone yesterday afternoon 8am MDT morning. definitely makes difference sense kids get vaccinated, there's really argument continuing impose mask mandates restrictions

This something many people sides restrictions argument get completely wrong. looking individual perspective. need protect X group. never brought in. prevent health service overwhelmed. vaccination vulnerable achieved that, would've dropped all. vaccination whole population doesn't, stay case.

I saying happen, benchmark everyone vaccinated make sense since never pandemic about.  study peer reviewed double blind study? Still talking Parkland.

Although similar vain, parent one Sandy Hook victims Alex Jones listener. podcast can't remember right now. pass vaccines instead candy? means vaccines effective preventing hospitalizations. However, regions US rest world still low vaccination rates probably see increases hospitalizations fall/winter. initially confused hospitalization rate chart, colors UK California curves got swapped compared case rate chart. suggest low confidence comes social media, though think discredit social media barometer confidence foolish. comes from, think, inconsistency expectations vaccine delivered result. Context (2 day averages Th. Fri.):

10/1: 2,597 new cases

10/8: 4,205

10/15: 8,297 average 4,149 day

10/22: 7,505 average 3,752 day

So, looks little better. Hope holds. According map based NYT, 3 counties MI medium, high, 10 extreme. 3 10 counties rural counties. 82 counties Michigan. Many people view vaccine mask mandates oppressive government. 

this claim need demonstrate far, done so. worth, situation seem fall umbrella who's recommended booster, least US. I'm situation intend get one near-term. Maybe line information regarding lasting immune system memory changes (which seem likely), I'm gonna rush get going side effects feeling like going die back April worth small benefit booster would likely me.

What bot?    also cause Denmark lifted lot restrictions? hospitalizations ICUs  90.7% efficacy means improved chance contracting Covid 90.7% compared placebo group. vaccine efficacy 90% means 90% reduction “from number cases would expect [trial participants had] vaccinated.  

A simple example, person 100% chance contracting disease, vaccine 90.7% efficacy chance contracting would 9.3%. “I think plan list things happen.” let’s shut flights UK.  I'm assuming severe COVID anything mild asymptomatic infection.   labeled “good news”? definitely good news honest evolved time. Pfizer finished adults booster trial published results yesterday.

VE double vaccinated 65% at, believe 5 months. booster 95.6% compared previously vaccinated, meaning confidence intervals 93.4%-99.5% compared unvaccinated that’s time period Delta spreading far wide.  charge 95. probably need booster confirmed prior infection got two shots mRNA vaccine. far, data I've come across suggests people situation tend strong, long lasting immunity. direct misinformation. Hundreds kids died COVID US. chance small, orders magnitude higher short bus ride, even full year. Agreed, made acceptance wrong conclusions happen much faster prone conspiracy. lived NM LA seen many similarities were, definitely pleasantly surprised.  Vaccines kids soon approved, like soon. feel like day I'm reminding people science done wildly unexpected things, gather data proof entirely expected ""no shit Sherlock"" stuff, too, show work, also sometimes find seemed obvious quite right entirely wrong. case work show already knew. good, someone build research perhaps figure ways mitigate problems, usually finding regions lower expected outcomes studying prevented expected outcomes. Thank you! I’ll take look. reading CDC website sons underlying conditions could affect severity. def getting vaccine. Apparently I’m one house without underlying condition :(     could seen result coming? I'm shocked. Unlike Alberta, March even kids 5-12 gotten shot, thus increasing immunity general population. Comments like make really convinced point people opposed lifting restrictions ever ""own dumb cons lol"" can't ignore pandemic away.

False, can. Especially vaccines make essentially deaths UK currently among vaccinated. vaccines solve everything.

...great job ignoring base rate fallacy. Congrats!

Look around. People care anymore, places high vaccinations that's totally fine basically cold vaccinated people. That's social end pandemic, probably get used that. Still careful! taunt covid like here. virus seems take kind talk *personally*. plan making vague references calling disease name claiming I'm good it. I've gotten superstitious like that. :) That's kids think. recognize lives literally worth millions dollars COVID infection, even 1/20,000 chance fatal life-changing, still taking hundreds dollars worth life expectancy off.

Carrots understand good.  Florida accidentally reached near herd immunity. Oregon willing kill 2.7 times people could done that. experts say likely 10% transmissible original Delta IMO seem much.  make sense, letting make sense yourself. telling 1 death every 700,000 people per day significant number? would blindly ignoring data think so. we're comparing previous poster said car crash analogy, odds dying car crash (in U.S.) 1 8,393. let's go ahead add restrictions disease majority vaccinated even though 90 times less likely die car crash.

Being vaccinated mean GET virus, means body knows KICK BUTT.

Don't confuse two  article pro-vax aproaches vaccination realistic perspective. prepares next step tries explain next step possible.

The vaccine (and come shock many people) meant prevent infections,that merely positive side effect first months. would nice vaccine able prevent infections forever simply case article explains doesnt neccesarily problem.

The idea is,and countries already adopted idea beeing slow boosters,to get everyone vaccinated once. first vaccination reduces infections important thing trains immune system handle future infections better.

After overcoming inevitable first infection help training got vaccine immune system keep learning (hopefully) eventually able deal future infections without need booster shots.

Booster shots meant prevent infection seems unrealistic aproach long run. would vaccinate whole population every 6 months immune system works general (though situations). immune system doesnt prevent infections,it deals infections there. vaccins meant for,to give immune system headstart dealing first infection.

I noticed people unrealistic expectations vaccins also people dont fully see endgame pandemic. 6 months boosters keep titters high endgame,and probably also desireable medical point vieuw (the human body slowly breaks titters reason,as article also briefly mentions).

Maybe explained better general public could help convince people become vaccinated. vaccine meant stop infections,its merely meant give immune system headstart inevitable first infection.

If aproach works reality yet seen,it could something else tried. preferred endgame dealing virus remember this. Heinz actually made it. living like permanently way live

Oh please. schools force kids wear uniforms. different that. harming kids, restricting free movement. mask, shackles. people say wanted compromise, I'd okay mask mandates applying indoors. point is, permanent, suggesting scaremongering, framing though violent hardship hyperbolic. Give rest.  Vaccinated people obviously immortal, dying Covid itself. 

Also, NHS afford ""diversity inclusion"" officers 70K salary clearly short cash.  Karma spreading hundreds millions anti vaccine messages using paid trolls  Noooooooooo. go office next week really want tomorrow. splitting hairs. get damn shot, stop enabling refuse it.  Sir, Wendy's. Direct spillover infected bats among likelier scenarios. that, spillover intermediary species reasonable option. Lots possibilities open food route one many, even one likely. Hospitals always fill up, besides UK counts covid death death within 28 days positive test. Lots them, especially among vaccinated people, going actually caused Covid. Rising cases matter, every time do, hospital rates design rise week later defund service years, struggle. deliberately obtuse say nothing Covid. There's massive backlog due last waves hospitalisations rising.

Vulnerable vaccinated people still die full health service means capacity cancer surgery backlogs huge waiting times ambulances etc = likely die accidents, strokes heart attacks. Hoping best Half cases kids right now, passing parents grandparents, resulting highest death toll since March. Getting vaccinated would big impact. That's good point think of. within days. Cdc director signs state sign-offs need happen start. guess weekend Monday never happen. country mask now. think anyone would accept this? point know covid low risk kids. already stopped masking would never go back it.

I 2 Pfizer well. zero effects either dose, except sore arm dose 1 nothing dose 2.

So way I'm curious see Moderna - get it. small way, yeah get it. mean, *literally* living historic event thats involving lots death uncertainty.

Again, agree views, surprising going certain demographics. Look, way medical care handled I. us probably finding vet puts hairless monkey tends standard problems.

Why allow weaponized propaganda leak domestic audience? Perhaps fine anti-human ethos kill foreigners nonsense, heads may roll publishing Russian too.  got Pfizer booster yesterday! considering Moderna, ultimately went vaccine side effects manageable data looked good enough.
Edit: first two shots Pfizer, get know sure half dose Moderna would less effective full dose Moderna.

When vast unvaccinated population, like example South, breeding ground virus spread mutate.    ethical situation changed too. original vaccine trials, treatment preventative COVID. could ethically run double blind trial placebo.

You’re right. posted memes Facebook dumb Americans /s disagree, decent portion population vaccinated, feedback effect. Israeli infection numbers came mid summer (the ones poopooed) probably quite realistic, want believe time. vaccinated still quite vulnerable waning immunity. virus jumping around unvaccinated higher rate vaccinated still low enough rate. Obviously really really hard truly quantify confounding variables, think becoming quite clear can't perpetually hang hat ""it's groups"".    founding fathers' idea freedom meant ""freedom oppression government"".

That's vaccine efficacy works. 95% figure mean 5% risk getting covid, means 5% risk getting covid *compared unvaccinated person*. Well, good, there's still three types mutate constantly.  believe technical term ""KWIJIBO"" Unvaxxed minded people shown unlikely take symptoms seriously much concern community large. unless truly out, much going mobile unmasked that! 30 year old + vaccinated people know still taking precautions. Unvaccinated people tend think invincible Covid “ flu” don’t take precautions. entirely political point. evidence there, billions people across globe successfully safely vaccinated, point getting vaccinated wearing mask want prove point, ""tough guy,"" get back another group.  country often even working, yet claim know better vaccines, immunology, medicine... etc Interesting take. thing would discuss Israel numbers. vaccination rate longer ""fairly high"" comparison countries also high vaccination rates (not even top 20).

It seems vaccinate quick aggressively, get good decrease fast take people ""out circulation"", especially restrictions, nature thing finds vaccinated weaker immunity, especially lower restriction environments.

Marylander, us. want blue crabs ourselves.  Well, definition that's true. waning severe disease much much less (although still worse rapid older immunocopromised groups) waning infection.

And answer question, studies mRNA vaccines CDC, FDA, WHO, etc looking peer review saying there's decline actively circulating antibodies begins day 29 post vaccination. makes sense, body going keep pumping antibodies there's nothing fight. But, vaccination body trained appropriately attack virus need to. ...couldn't get much worse last winter?  “Sure, computer might stop working, that’s rare.“

I laugh given I’ve 3 14 desktops servers work die past week. Due physical problems. Holy hell patience vaccinated mean GET virus, means body knows KICK BUTT


Being vaccinated means less likely get virus, less likely get seriously sick catch it. sure people need latch over-simplified concepts like said, even accurate. may watched run last week A'dam marathon. :)   think that's best hope... I'd prefer move on. completely agree idea that, currently, way slow disease seemingly regular boost regime. hypocritical ask us implement NPIs masking control spread, simultaneously telling us infection irrelevant.

I sure I've heard message meaningful way. I've heard important keep masking **because** infection wanes profound way.

That said, feel like we're going come grips reality people getting ""boosted"" way often even vaccine advocates comfortable with. want stop spread infections. Otherwise virus continue evolve we'll playing whack-a-mole forever.  hear one high-school dropout saying ""did research"" I'm going blow gasket. Really Janice, find time perform virology experiments waitressing IHOP raising 5 kids? It’s idiots Twitter. It’s nightly news making huge deal “breakthrough” infections acting like failure vaccine. nightly news wouldn’t give context it’s say vaccines offered 90% protection. 

And yes Biden. Fauci would give context either mic. Biden mic December June articulating vaccine won’t stop getting virus? doubt it. get vaccine you’ll basically safe. Fauci CDC talk back spring boosters ALREADY developed then? 

Even HR office pretty big company wrote emails encouraging us get vaccine spring verbiage safe “you still get virus won’t get really sick” 

The way people talk vaccines TOTALLY different 6 months ago  That's unexpectedly quick study like that! Young people given vaccine last, six months later booster would pretty soon. Seems like would getting started now. find original? right something mean it. got vaccine still retain right so. childish. article- ""Men much likely die COVID-19 women. true globally – death rate 50% higher men. Notably, **this gap appear explained either differences number confirmed cases pre-existing conditions**."" Based data report, women actually confirmed cases compared men, less likely die.

The article suggests one possibility women likely hospitality/healthcare/service jobs, may mean tested more. would mean mild asymptomatic cases captured women often men. Fullly vaccinated (69%) Men smoke though, smoking reduces obesity nicotine appetite suppressant. Men smoke though, smoking reduces obesity nicotine appetite suppressant. Mountains new data show otherwise. study kind 2015 might well ancient history. That's issue. fine. take start experience side effects. Well yeah, talking specific strain seen 18 months. strains still tracked spreading wildly moment. Imagine vaccinated.🤔 post spreading fear. trashy Probably attended Donald Trump U.  due low vax rates sputnik working people following health protocols? (Article opening me.) Waiting everyone world gets first nice sentiment logistically doesn’t help anyone. could give booster dose someone world really wanted first dose didn’t access, would. It’s logistically feasible. Right US seems less demand vaccines rather get booster lower chance spreading illness community let go waste. Delta sagat ay.4 bison?  least Netherlands overreact forbidding people leave houses, like Spain, France Italy did.  said, ""highly vaxxed state"". Well good you. Sounds like may reached point described (though would defer medical professionals see whether think system overburdened). lot states position. recent surges:

A guy Texas treatable gallstone pancratitis sat ER 7 hours hospital hospital 5 states turned away full. finally located hospital could take him, organs started failing helicopter flight boy Florida appendix burst sat 6 hours ER waiting room: man Alabama died cardiac event turned away 43 hospital: Ohio, hospitals near capacity. early september, actually situation hospital one county full.

So maybe things fine you, fine sound like state good, sounds like moved removing restrictions. That's great, I'm sure sound angry states good situation able yet.  Lead Paragraphs:

Good stuff. Aaaannnnd still replies comments. 🤣 #triggered Hi need advice,

I recentally took covid test 2 days ago came back positive, however took one earlier today result came back negative. take tests go 2nd result? actually PATHETIC. scheduled Moderna booster dose. give correct info first 2 doses - way schedule.

Given experience - called confirm going. Pharmacist said - CDC card? said ""Yes"".

She said - Please read last dose info. gave Pfizer.

Then said: ""We sorry. cannot provide Moderna booster. change appointment Pfizer booster"".

What hell? CDC literally said could this. ( Pfizer + Moderna) need lie get booster shot want? large workforce Texas, prohibits vaccine mandates. may factor don’t understand still articles say this. Like fucking shit, found year ago, yet keep saying bullshit. also majority vaccinated No-one talking absolute numbers here. 

What else mean? He's specifically talking absolute means states **majority unvaccinated minorities.** Boo-hoo. attitude medical care disease prevention reads like thing lift spirits mysterious deity sky come immediately cure illness.

Grow up. Antiquated systems make mistakes new ones, they're harder work less intuitive user interfaces less functionality. Anyway, sound like computer error me, sounds like human quality assurance check last week revealed problems way OHA gathering data COVID-19 death records case reports. ask fuck Reddit went bit nuts. year two ago people saying needed $15 minimum wage employers cheap. Now, there's constantly shit jobs available $18-21 hour college education people still complaining nOwHeRe nEaR lIvInG wAgE PAY EMPLOYEES MORE. Like idk, could live ok wage, especially starting point still probably like 85% vaccinated... drug companies developing two hurdles. First off, takes time get clinical trials. Second, know provide immunity greater original shots. Yes I'm claiming discount official sources say safe effective. Thats part consideration.

And goes ways, disagree scientist disagrees consensus? everyone differing opinion peddler misinformation. clearly disagreements this, booster discussion FDA shows differences opinion valid points. admitting people smarter better something makes feel bad.

We're nation coddled, fragile egos. know people voted tell did. Anecdotes evidence. risk spread shown much lower personal experience shown statistically significant common.

Like said, I'd fine testing everyone daily reduce spread get us endemic eradication, trying use personal experience evidence people getting vaccinated. definitely important debunk bad ideas support good ones, regardless background person holds ideas. regards people vax hesitant, I’m equal opportunity. However, also important take account trauma engaging people, background informs opinion. big example opioid epidemic hit depressed former industrial towns. “drugs bad, stop it” approach didn’t work well understanding economic health systems issues contributed issue, using knowledge fix problem. Yeah offered 2nd J&amp;J shot want Moderna I'm holding that. clinical trials test everyone, symptoms not.

Are talking pivotal clinical trials J&amp;J, PFizer, Moderna?

I every study protocol pulled right now, ENSEMBLE enrollment, trigger nasal swab testing symptoms positive test collected elsewhere. participant population tested covid specified intevals capture symptomatic asymptomatic infections.

pls tell information pivotal trials, participants regularly tested participants infection regardless symptom history pretty mad. go website literally home page big red box. None whatsoever. said, sample size one, ymmv. I'm sure understanding.

Will percentage people vulnerable populations die suffer serious illness infected viruses? Yes.

Could lower percentage bubbling others perpetuity? course.           
Are 0 side-effect costs that? no.

As understand 94% covid-19 deaths age 50 majority percentage health complications often related lifestyle. want talk saving lives covid real conversation health, exercise, diet, reduction work-related stress, issue overworking, on. one wants bring uncomfortable obvious truth.

In post-vaccine world risk death severe illness covid-19 well numerous risks everyone accepts daily. I'm sure average vaccinated individual far likely die maimed vehicular accident harmed covid-19. government, time, run anti-intellectuals, anti-vaxxers, climate change deniers, conspiracy buffs. (It's *just* US problem, worst last year.) Multiple world leaders downplaying potential severity virus, fudging numbers favor self-aggrandizement truth, intentionally hamstringing efforts scientists medical personnel contain it.

We allowed system empower people put greed narcissism welfare world things live it.  R0 tell whole story, however; measles G 11 days, Delta looks something like 4-5, maybe lower. Cases Chile rising (2086 today). good news deaths staying low. according keep mask mandates distancing forever and/or reach Covid Zero? nobody accept it.  here. he's 1st place cited researcher, therefore can't trusted! /s

In honesty, I'm curious know cited researcher world. Absolutely correct. would add that, there's argument maintaining high antibody levels, need come say is, balanced risk illness degree severity. Given efficacy vaccines, I'm sure really call ""false"" sense security. Absent idiotic family, everyone know vaccinated, everyone aware still get sick, every one less likely wear mask except situations they're absolutely forced to. I'm way. understand still get sick, odds serious illness low willing take risk order joy actually able communicate someone clearly, hear heard, exchange smile stranger.  joke, know books/resources help parents this? gloss advice currently given immunologists public health experts. Alex Jones spread Sandy Hook conspiracy theory held liable Texas court Also got J&amp;J back April, scheduled Moderna booster next Tuesday. 

Very relieved getting Moderna booster, many problems J&amp;J got rolled communication around piss poor. Noone, dude displays what's wrong 99% internet. reading shit exaggerating already exaggerated headlines. Fair. age chart shows 1/50,000 rate 20s age groups, includes non-causal events. next page talk casualty claimed probable (which strange remember reading background rate 1/300,000).

Reading whole thing again, we're looking youngest group (which lower rate) half 30 days since third shot. long myocarditis reporting take? studies shown similar side effects second dose, none (or would expected had) m/p events. possible rate actually lower measured accurately yet?

1/50,000 definitely measured number, though smaller 1/20,000 studies shown second dose. sometimes like think infection like Starcraft Zerg swarm. Get couple little zerglings (low exposure, low viral load), body trouble fighting off. Get sizeable swarm (infected person coughs direction) got problems.

The vaccine basically builds defenses swarm. means deal bigger groups Zerg defenses overwhelmed get sick. mean impenetrable defenses though. Plus, people, instead building solid, stable defenses, bodies create line marines call day (i.e. weak immune response).

So, truly want prevent infection, takes make sure swarm encounter small possible. means hand washing, proper distancing, mask situations warrant it. kinda racist grade minorities curve comes things like this? nonsense! Maybe try another pharmacy get later slot? They’ve studied variant ones booster isn’t that. doesn’t seem necessary point specifically target variants. original vaccines highly effective variants. issue waning immunity new variants terms effectiveness. Yeah watching people toilet paper like gold, can’t imagine reaction people today asked/ordered ration items like WW2. Damn, I've always wondered Russia's real numbers are. imagine bad things must actually be, projected be, taking step point pandemic. conversation non professional setting. right believe say want, outdated harmful ideas. Check article linked earlier comment chain, though. 50% medical students residents study believed one similar ideas without scientific basis polled. Better general populace (in study, think 75% nonmedical public believed ideas), still highly concerning prevalent. aka....we know going do..... Awesome - thank ya! appear so, death rate spiked like everywhere else. people causing surge truly unvaccinated, make difference hospitals. really is. point hundred thousand people voluntarily died they're consuming much misinformation.

Nonetheless, they're pretty good terms deaths per capita less 4 death per million past week. Portugal 5 deaths per million per week. point, getting third doses 65+ group probably far important countries trying get holdouts get vaccinated.  expert says this, expert says that...

i see benefit getting symptomatic covid all. getting little poke arm way better smell taste weeks.   Whenever look vaccines, see source source source saying vaccines safe effective. Yeah, early pandemic, know X yet, said Y, explain that! CVS also bookable easy mix match. Feeling hesitant getting booster. scheduled flu shot weekend keep questioning really need it. work doctor's office part would rather get covid vaccine keep getting booster. Well it’s good question. long last? Also percentage children experience symptoms all? Hint it’s 90% really need figure political divide surrounding vaccines.

Democrats enthusiastic covid-19 vaccine, naturally Republicans need contrary that. understand republican party anti-whatever-democrats-want-to-do makes sense (I saying REPUBLICANS, rather leadership, representatives media apparatuses behave) girlfriend’s family fully vaccinated contracted delta variant. friend fully vaccinated, works restaurant, contracted delta variant. employees work restaurant fully vaccinated told “they’ve gotten delta variant vaccinated”. Apparently people down-voted suggesting Apple test vaccinated employees daily, don’t like safety. 50+ years trusting government. That's enough data you? r/woosh Websites major pharmacies bookable 8am eastern today. pick whichever brand want, may flexible location depending brands stock patience. work school masks 8 months.

Well sound angry me, I'm quite sure why. read previous post, think pretty clear position able get back normal two conditions met: 1) next vaccine rollouts ready next months, 2) hospitals overrun.

Thanks advance! where? Sounds like something needs reported.  sure actually happening, would expected infection gives perfect immunity. end result would ~100% unvaccinated catching COVID cases there, (say) 20% vaccinated caught cases eventually died out.

Oh awesome, gotten yet? Mine later afternoon I've seen posts people's appointments getting cancelled, hope happen here--even though know even next week does! England, 3rd leading cause death August. According vaccine surveillance report 42, around 80% deaths vaccinated recent time frames. 

Without vaccine, COVID would far away leading cause death, still remaining one main causes death even vaccinated people. annoying plainly see people avoiding medical treatments simply b/c quasi-mandated. childish rebellion. saw Prof Peter Hotez make good point Twitter, safety efficacy data massively available sticking vaccine, we'll know Israel (for Pfizer) third dose begins wane.

I'm still tempted Moderna also male 30 (myocarditis risk group) leaning towards another Pfizer shot. I'm pretty sure recent statistics (where got 94% think) show lower overall efficacy Delta, used higher even Alpha. Booster data showing high efficacy. Right line original 2 dose efficacy Delta came along. dont believe 2 doses 3 4 weeks apart enough. lot vaccines require 3 shots. think need make full vaccination 3 doses like Israel. Make sure least wait 6 months antibodies come I'd say stick brand got. Personal opinion brand take grain salt. got 3 Pfizer.  original comment gross though, implies disagreement = lack intellect. know extent people disagree.

And creating fake profile struggling waitress make point intellectual superiority weird downright exposes smugness. Really baffling.  think people, large, desire well-known loved, see popstars athletes actors, less people think achieve intellectual field. society anf media system showed much reverence scientists mathematicians engineers, think we'd bigger group young people wanting see every time we're fed opinion celebrity matter far beyond scope expertise.

Ask actor anything acting, musician music, model fashion - get seat table comes science medicine. yet time see headlines like ""Tom Cruise gives interview pandemic"".

I've heard said ""we entertaining death"" establishments supposed real serious business replaced entertainment.   News came out. Would get moderna booster now? I'm still fence. first doses pfizer.

Also, studies show one get antibodies getting booster. Long COVID vaccinated individuals common.  Yes data! evidence booster, evidence booster compared full dose booster Moderna Pfizer Older immunocompromised people still risk, even vaccinated. saw general statistic older vaccinated people risk level unvaccinated children -- think death infection. Although COVID endemic, still respond case counts get high, even impossible push case counts zero. current guidance 6 months second dose booster fall broad risk categories. probably nothing fear vaccinated people still transmit covid (in limited capacity) could potentially get older family sick. There's really harm getting booster  I'm still fence. learn anything new? rates long covid vaccinated people?

Is data actually driving ""cases matter"" position?  Maybe Delta around earlier trials done? Basically graduates School Hard Knocks convinced generations higher education hoax. every time expert unravels part tightly-wound fairy tale worldview, delusions cause angry, nonsensical responses.  developing world, hundreds millions people unable get vaccine protect ravages Covid-19, millions already become infected wealthy nations donate billions doses working, public health experts say. solution, many believe, countries something big American mRNA vaccine makers say feasible: Manufacture gold-standard mRNA shots themselves. got J&amp;J back March bet I'm getting mRNA booster.

The virus also good time largely thanks unvaccinated, mutating every often spreads makes copies itself. know mutations lead: maybe something worse delta variant, maybe something bad all. 

tl;dr 1) circumstances unvaccinated, chance spread life. 2) Teenage Mutant Ninja Covid. 

If legitimately can't get vaccine reason, that's fine. 

If skipping scared, think conspiracy, hundred dumb shit reasons, part problem.

Edit: Looked comment history. part problem. Goodbye. Time get booster season pass Colorado Springs shooting high score. roughly population Denver county, El Paso county (Colorado Springs) double case rate Denver, Denver’s isn’t super low anything.  Aaaannnnd still replies comments. 🤣 #triggered Yeah unfortunately us pharmacy side can't anything what's site. One time covid testing machines went close website took couple days update testing guy telling us wear masks early part pandemic? still think weird general visitors wear whatever dirty fuck outside clothing shoes want onto floor, carrying god knows areas people area recovering in... think want visit someone recovering hospital wearing shoe covers, clothing covers, mask regardless. clarify, cause confusion, get 3 different vaccines booster shot, want get either Pfizer Moderna one effective.

The Moderna *booster* shot *not* original 2 Moderna shots, difference Moderna booster shot 1/2 50% dosage original Moderna shot.

Everything else same.

The Pfizer booster shot same, original shot anyone would gotten first second shot.

Hope helps.     Wish could get 11yo press arm fence vaccination.     Well, humans made computers. So… kidding.

A bit flip rare shouldn’t really considered here. random bit flip due cosmic radiation isn’t causes “computer issues” like this. Boeing software issues crashed two jets weren’t caused bit flips, caused terrible management decisions. Facebook went dark week two ago wasn’t bit flip, guy typed wrong thing window somewhere shut entire network. software prevented this, least popped dialog box saying “are sure want get fired?”.

I think taking issue originally attempts blame computers many things fact simply poor management decisions, human factors issues, bad programming bad design. user error, 9/10 times user error fault software user. society toddlers made fake one they've used invent fantasy around  names? booster dose Moderna half-dose original two vaccines.

For got additional dose Moderna (e.g., immunocompromised people), exactly vaccine/dose first two. Seriously, ""freedom"" ends rights begin.  Yeah article debunks nothing. horse already left barn back Agreed. making mistakes, learning. side coin, think everything perfect, never going improve.    Honestly don’t think Fouci. 

I think would lot credible least 3 him. lot work. 

The thing he’s even caught contradicting himself. bad. Really bad. it’s people latching to. 

If 3 him, would lot easier trust them, even didn’t entirely agree.  Better call store.

I'm reading reports COVID subs people told pharmacies ready roll mixed boosting they're turned away getting mixed boosters today, *even though* websites let schedule appointment. scientists charge determining variants issue.   90.7% efficacy children even contracting covid, death rate. Less children getting covid means even less hospitalizations deaths. It’s positive thing soon 2-4 approved, kids getting vaccine. 

Edit: response someone arguing children even need vaccinated.  Thanks. I’m Canada boosters yet AFAIK, got second shot July. Health fine never covid. jurisdiction requires proof vax go restaurants, etc., using forged documents get around this, makes wary.  dude. really don’t want experience that’s every six months. right?! never thought I'd see parents fight hard allow kids get sick. pure crazy  \*should\* slam dunk based data, people like Cody Meissner advisory panel, shocked vote closer be. Let's hope rationality logic prevail us want best protection available kids get access it. That's demonstrably false. See: literally everything that's published topic. receipt says 5mL ""qty: 0.25"" sounds like half dose tell sure.   really argument comparing flu we're actually seeing flu-like numbers. 7 day average daily covid deaths U.S. currently around 1,500. That's 10x flu typically time year. shame doesnt take care avoid misinformation then. memory:

- misinformed people saying masks unnecessary avoid mask shortages hospitals.

- misinformed people saying zero evidence virus escaped lab despite evidence did.

- misinformed people giving herd immunity requirements varied based felt politically achievable rather minimum vaccine coverage understood time.

- misinformed people agreeing celebrities taking horse medicine despite aware were, obviously, taking human (if ineffective) medicine.

People say misinformation dont seem suits them. seems binary thing. cant also regularly deliberately engaging it. FB smoke/vape break? Delta++, polymorphism destructors!  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

But read quite get point, want point holdout factor several non-white groups unethical testing, straight-up lies perpetrated government certain sects medical community. limited forced infection sterility. definitely hear certain groups today distrust Big Medicine communities got passed great/grandparent youth today.

Thanks! womp womp womp... Cuntry  averaging many different regions, idea they're regard mitigation policies, stat pretty hard understand. think useful know local state number cases time risk hospitalization per infection. They're almost certainly releasing new one delta even did, well next year.

The Pfizer booster putting people 97-99% *against symptomatic covid*... there's nowhere go specific boosters, they're really interested disruption changing over. measles vaccine basically sterilizing, though. Meaning almost completely eliminates infection, thereby stopping spread tracks.

The covid vaccines much leakier, obviously. yikes, study, kids severe adverse reaction shot (5) severe covid (0) Pretty easy, listen people charge public health people get paid via clicks views. Cool, that’s thought. Curious side effects like mixing. day heavy flu like j&amp;j. unvaccinated carrying virus, means viral load likely larger vaxxed, would make contagious. vaccinated, catch Covid viral load would likely smaller theres, that’s necessarily outcome. Either way, wouldn’t want expose anyone isn’t vaccinated can’t be.  cousin spoke 20 parents 40. covid last year suppose alpha strain yes vaccinated way. going florida visit family set alarm bells me. asked delay two weeks get dose vaccine immediately. could feel wall going up. ask many times.

Meaning state Pfizer 1st 2 doses, system allows schedule Pfizer booster.

This completely comparable actual boosters Moderna booster halved compared study.  also probably accurate say mixing matching shown effective. I'm point adults take precautions kids.

Which would result reduced spread control experimental groups adults.

Here's made numbers help make sense you.

All 4 groups 15k.

Infections among group:

Control Kids: 200

Control Adults: 100

Experimental Kids: 20

Experimental Adults: 5

So, kids yuckier adults spread control group, see 2x gap experimental group efficacy higher adults kids.

There's lots plausible explanations efficacy lower, ""kids spread disease like crazy"" one them.  Well shock.  Omg appreciate post. think I'm looking for. know one study full dose, still. Thank you!!!!!

I seriously told someone I'd prolly flip coin 5 hours. Go buy cigar celebrate smoker. 

Mental health issues (any), smoking pot, drinking 3-5 drinks nights (you go standard updated- whatever gets 0.08... officially binge drinker, alcohol use disorder), none either?

And know there's verification right? check box saying qualify. It‘s possible American Revolution doesn’t succeed without smallpox vaccination Washington forced army get.

Now we're talking something agreed signed up. join military literally give life government term service. several instances Americans sacrifice individual liberties betterment society.

Individual liberty foundation concept nation. Tell what, present copy ""social contract"" signed maybe I'll change tune.  half-dose Moderna booster kicking ass like full-dose 2nd shot. Except hospitalizations deaths rising quickly cases there. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Man took trip VAERS data report potential vaccine side effect happens within certain amount time vaccination. 

One report 84 year old man died, primary symptom ""gunshot wound chest"". aggregate kind junk bullshit get lot 'vaccine injuries'. 

Also self-reported magnetization ones arm note scared go doctor this.. Walgreens seems good go to, got mine three hours ago. Pharmacy worker said lot booster traffic today. 24.9 bmi? Eat big meal re-weigh lol Science may fluid, mean experts questioned held accountable actions. already forget epidemiologists advising travel restrictions months first confirmed cases China? virologists saying there's proof masks effective means protection airborne virus? politicians made half-hearted efforts sustain people's livelihoods lockdown era later swayed promises return normal keep? probably mainly seasonality. Respiratory viruses increase prevalence every fall.  got Moderna booster (50mcg) three hours ago Walgreens Huntsville Alabama.

I two Moderna doses six months ago, effects sore arm. far I'm zero effects time, how's everyone else's experience going? higher time last year. higher months ago. We're still riding second biggest wave we've far! metric chose COVID high far low gonna get. Yeah exactly. Like, mistake lie. Updating recommendations learning definitely lie. really think boils convenient excuse follow guidance. tried tell could dislike Fauci want, he's sole source information this. Somehow kept steering back towards Fauci Biden saying that, usually something well year ago. want real science concensus, want say ""liberal "" leaders wrong can't trust anything except echo chambers. include CDC FDA continue contradict themselves? 

The day CDC recommended kids wear masks even they're vaccinated. still restricted age group risk factors, right? 2 week provide full immunity starts increasing first days. stay 0 2 weeks jump full protection. got mine today. reaction 2nd hopefully stays way. It‘s possible American Revolution doesn’t succeed without smallpox vaccination Washington forced army get. several instances Americans sacrifice individual liberties betterment society.

Thanks help!  anyone seen anything specific safety data? could find:
""Further, COVID-19 vaccine well tolerated, side effects generally comparable observed participants 16 25 years age.""

Is anything specific side effects observed many participants? article said added children trial observe safety vaccine 1/3 received second dose less two weeks ago. 

Also, NYT said article weeks clinical trial children intended draw meaningful conclusions vaccine’s ability prevent disease hospitalizations. Instead, researchers looked antibody levels, comparing conferred high protection adults. Regulators expected compare immune responses vaccine efficacy data adult population.""

So 90.7% number ""meaningful conclusion"" since based vaccine's ability prevent disease? changed last two weeks made go ""the trial intended draw meaningful conclusions vaccine's ability prevent disease"" ""here's conclusion vaccine's ability prevent disease""?

I trying find straightforward data real numbers efficacy safety based trial children coming much.  that's i'm seeing too. Mind kids COVID tend fare much better adults part, disregard 0-20 segment might get better picture. ""Time move on"" works willing let lot people die dying previously. potentially cripple hospital system.

That's every single nation facing - pandemic gone away, get worse many places head toward northern hemisphere winter. received 0.25, looking booster half dose. full series Moderna 0.5. 

So JnJ 0.25 Moderna booster.  Bullshit. It’s 90% effective now, exactly studied. obligation im moment address questions vaccine every confidence research done address relevant questions. Quit pretending result flawed it’s addressing whatever tertiary thing mind. here, woo!! Finally, second dose.  People *views* everything. police showing door syringe gun, that's vaccine oppression. choose give job rather follow rules, still remote work opportunities you.

Right situation varies state state sometimes city city. I'm sure cases actual government oppression mixed (less extreme example, effectively terms enforcement law) national truth. vast majority job losses ultimately individual's choice, even see vaccinated choice make. boosters approved 50, yes. least rural Colorado, already get one (I one Tuesday) that's surely original 100. Yes, that's science works, speculate, test, use verified data speculate. fine speculate make clear are, did. You’re arguing semantics word mistake. there’s bit flip due random electromagnetic radiation, causes computer give wrong answer, that’s still making mistake. take 2 weeks provide immunity. Even booster? screwed either way. Ironic  watched idiocracy explains lot.  Uk actually creating new, worse variant soon they’ll isolated quarantined island year.    Russia already around 800k excess deaths, close US absolute numbers despite less half population. current situation worse ever. surprising exceeds US peaks. grim. that's population unwilling vaccinate even wear masks. believe Moderna boosters currently 50 100. source otherwise, I'd definitely interested seeing it.  Sounds like speculation evidence-based.  doesn't. point adults take precautions kids. comparison adults children. ""fundamentally misunderstand"" anything. Eastern Europe Russia seeing new wave too. spiking extreme rates - 2x cases last week Poland. spreads like fire despite half population vaccinated (only half still).    holding least 10% infections many different regions, weeks now, previous variant done prevalent Delta OG, definitely got fitness, likely viral load like OG previous variants. Got mix match (j+j Moderna) booster scheduled Wednesday!! hope don’t many bad side effects ticket early screening Last Night Soho night. Whats going population reasonably reached conclusion case numbers largely irrelevant highly vaccinated population.

I envious them.   reminder there’s something like 25,000 people living Indian reservations Minnesota. Yep, try conversation get shut “anti-vaxxer” idiot won’t “follow science.” Since science become something can’t discuss, question, explore, test, observe? people admit still don’t know lot virus yet, question narrative vaccine way, immediately delegitimized shut down. vaccinated, coworkers vaccinated, family, etc. questions able conversation explore science without accused terrible person. makes sad now, can’t talk other. It’s bunch petulant children screaming “You can’t tell do!!!!”    Needle anxiety/phobia/panic may source delay surprising number people.  waiting nasal vaccine.   boils failure education. question kind gave pause. know what, I'm actually sure. feel like find communicate I've learned hard way. parents best example, lucky enough find examples helped see real parent like (even trying teach me).

The simplest way put is, every decision make parent, asking yourself: what's going help make kid best version be? (Note: *not* ""the best version *myself* be."")

It might sound shallow, promise not. Sometimes means teaching (which three step process: ""I do, do, do"") sometimes means letting go develop independence. Building practical competence, social integrity, critical thinking, emotional maturity incredibly nuanced. parent going perfect it, least communicating values give kids fighting chance.

And guarantee they're learning current education system.

Actually, book subtopic mentioned might order book parenting itself. I'll think one! Clearly there’s something going there. high case plateau begin with, they’re spiking top that. Doesn’t add we’re seeing everywhere else world. Unfortunately, new variant even outpace Delta seems like logical explanation 😕.

Hope isn’t something rest world starts getting hit December January.  far (about 1.5 hours appointment) heard anything via phone/email telling otherwise. Hoping show ""Oops, well ACTUALLY..."" sorta thing.

Glad hear got appointment! neither boosters. thoughts well. work full time job public facing office well second part time job public facing area. also several parties coming go figured might well get booster can. question, need since I'm early 30s generally healthy. initial claim pre - delta 

""Our data CDC today suggests vaccinated people carry virus, get sick, clinical trials, also real-world data.""

This true Alpha dominant. vaccines never stopped someone carrying virus, claimed Pfizer part Pfizer measured study - measured symptomatic reduction. someone question claim (which people did) would justification so! government said beginning pandemic masks likely protect degree (by much unclear since data available point) urged people buy currently needed health professionals people contact vulnerable people.

In US, tell people buy something save elderly immunocompromised, people rush line order stockpile evidenced toilet paper, meat, eggs etc. government released vaccines everyone simply asked people wait elderly front line workers vaccinated first....EVERYONE would rushed lined vaccination. allowed needed vaccinations go first, like kinda socialist country, people decided want it. barrel roll! actually lost cause, would say. culture ignorance winning. Plan futures wisely.  Anthony Fauci hero role played multiple public health crises career, especially HIV epidemic, nothing take away him, somewhat ironic.

 
Fauci arguably net negative COVID era role eroding public trust spreading misinformation crucial pandemic topics \[1\]:

 
The early **dismissal masks**. story complicated, clearly simply matter evolving science. Slate's writers put ""The Noble Lies thing beyond doubt, however: One two statements \[on masks\] accurately reflect evidence Fauci saw it. high-profile mixed messages short time frame, without substantive new data justify change, generated confusion backlash politicians, experts, general public.

His knowingly false (by words!) **estimates herd immunity threshold**. part revisions related new data, [as Donald McNeil wrote New York Fauci deliberately withholding real Fauci acknowledged slowly deliberately moving goal posts. so, said, partly based new science, partly gut feeling country finally ready hear really thinks.

Other times, admits concerned consequences communicating truth, rather disseminating knowledge. example, early 2021, [he said switching ""first shots first"" telling people \[two shots\] … say, ‘Oops, changed mind’?” Fauci said. “I think would messaging challenge, say least.”

I mean ... he's right, paying attention reading March 2021, becoming increasingly harder take anything says face value anymore.

TL;DR: Hero scientist undermines Americans' trust experts COVID. 
\[1\] hard say certainty, difficult assess important reining Trump. difficult discriminate waning immunity reduced efficacy vs. delta. Sure, make educated guesses immunity children progress, there's reasonably wide gap scientific research educated guesses. lucky. None pharmacies nearby Moderna boosters, ones appointments next week. reason Pfizer rules area. I'm waiting one grocery chain update site hoping may availability weekend. People different. bad. much so, spend lot away. travel lot business anyway property Florida, restrictions returned August, started staying here. plan stay crazy done California. Unfortunately, return periodically dread it. Many friends thing, sooner did. kind went first 15 months, majority community vaccinated, restrictions unnecessary (in opinion). 

The school issue big one one dealing long time. unnecessary shut 18 months. communities reopened long California issues. also opposed mask schools. believe developmentally harmful children. largely unaffected covid parents likely vaccinated. wearing masks. 

You mention impoverished communities. Imagine minimum near minimum wage worker this. Many lost jobs.

It easy talk cost benefit analysis restrictions. professionals supposed us. Unfortunately, ones California failed. disagree policies politics Florida, see public health response produced much better result California. far balanced resulted community rebound quickly less assistance. Yes, resulted deaths, dramatically so. fact, vaccinations became available, per capita death rate much worse California. Unfortunately, vaccines became available politics Florida slowed vaccination. 

At point, someone gets covid dies it, likely unvaccinated. choice made. wear mask abide restriction protect them. want protection, need get vaccinated. well kids generally spreading viruses like crazy. 

This statement shows fundamental misunderstanding efficacy calculated.

That ""spreading like crazy"" would happen control experimental groups. wasn’t anti vaxx. brother. We're living exciting times! think good options safe, might important statement mixing matching.

Using existing data, one extrapolate, immune response might stronger Moderna. what's gonna magic difference changing within next weeks? Even government saying could 100k daily cases. Half-term might cause mini dip weather's getting colder, rainier darker people dining meeting inside. Holy crap dude. wasn’t complaining anything. didn’t call pharmacy start chewing people there. waited appointments available booked appointment. Get yourself.   doctor play one TV suspect cautious worried. vaccinated suggestion go get test 3-5 days exposure ... maybe stay holed today away people, go get rapid test tomorrow Sunday sure. Keep eye symptoms otherwise, careful. 

You may want schedule telehealth visit option live double-check everything. Talking trained medical worker way better listening :)

I hope friend better soon. I'm sure Canadians fringe object, however seem employed company.

I've mostly heard people praising corporate measures, come facilities feel safer.

Customers also want feel safe dealing company.

The company shutdown manufacturing week sanitize one employee PCR tested positive. cases occurred since.

My employer also gives time-off get vaccinated, recover it, well generous time-off vacation begin with. Part-time employees well.   seems unlikely given recent data sets. Source? I'm guessing based fact mixing never went formal trials. lmao. Oh right, that's word it. Yes agree. don’t lead headline like mislead people it’s 90% effective won’t months. 

Be honest people Literally reason given friend. ""He lied masks lost credibility."" Like... still latch onto something March 2020 pretend nothing changed since then. Sure it’s months might worth False equivalence. never asked vaccines onboarding recent job. Everybody acts like vaccines work, vaccinated unvaccinated, begin with. vaccine works get shot protected! typical course vaccines take effective way, they? natural immunity seat table discussion? farce. Surging/not surging really great metric measure unless pretty much got herd immunity - amount traffic bay area sees, they're going surge least little bit along connected areas breakthrough/vulnerable/unvaccinated cases.

A high vaccination rate probably greatly reduced size surge, can't really know would looked like lower vaccination rate. record, took information context. quoted CDC, blame messaging public awful.

You absolutely take context. mention comparing delta alpha. even said, ""The CDC director initially said data shows vaccinated people can't spread disease,"" **implying previous statement wrong somebody questioning would right.** fact one statement made **before** emergence delta variant made **after** **HUGELY** important context completely omitted. Plan B masking Covid passes mass events. lockdowns. Everyone wants avoid lockdowns. keep bumbling along way are, Plan B effective lockdown will. mad lockdown people couldnt minor behavioral changes whilst get winter, get antivirals rolled easily accessible vaccinate teens. discussing secondary concern isn’t within scope trial, it’s material issue context.

the primary function vaccine protect inoculated child serious illness death, without putting unacceptable risk problematic side effects. today confirm things.

Now question whether child vaccinated might still asymptomatic carrier explored, along whole host secondary questions. questions take answer time required conduct follow-on studies. used boost get through. 


Team Mix Match go! (J&amp;J+Moderna) Besides mandates, y'all think main driver people getting first dose?

I saw former housemate co-worker got assume first yesterday I'm curious finally made it. ever anti-vaxxer knowing assume apathetic. often need booster shots?  working people hurting working people prove free solve problem, makes everything worse.

I think point along lines foundational dynamic get over. something lost time makes sense. Source. almost certain transmissible wouldn’t say anything. think must challenging separate subvariant delta that’s sequencing. founding fathers public gun fights other. founding fathers committed genocide. founding fathers owned humans engaged sex trafficking. 

Women expected subservient husbands. white male property owners could vote, natives, women, blacks. 

The idea founding fathers experts freedom human rights myth. vaccines still remain 90 percent well preventing severe illness however always main goal. problem would say us still 70 million unvaccinated could definitely spark yet another surge.

This especially case around 2000, dot-com ""geniuses"" #1 cool guys. recall hearing mid-to-late 2000s backlash forming; idea far would go. However, what's happening long roots, seems likely used opportunity raise support anything; useful issue whipping resentment. like wild boar hunts Texas. Rent helicopter group rednecks shooting doors. Hell, could probably get antivaxxers pay privilege means hunting.   Transient ischemic attack?  got Moderna’d  90.7% great, also wonder seems higher prior studies adults (I think 94%?) Could lower dosage give strong reaction adult dosage does?

Either way, I'm looking forward getting kids ASAP.  corporate issue. Walgreens higher ups give OK allow mix match Walgreens pharmacists give working getting booster immediately fine general, thing Israeli data breakthroughs pronounced 65+ weaker immune systems general large margin.

COVID protection seems combination of...

1. Robust antibody response. (Which clearly wanes time effective short term)
2. Rapidly responding strong immune systems trained recognize (T/B-Cells)
3. First second option responding faster whatever dominant variant (Delta case, much higher viral load).

Thus, data points idea younger healthier populations 3 vaccines overcome current variants protect breakthroughs successfully 1 2 effect, likely still keep virus bay even 2 only. Breakthroughs still seem rare among crowd, even 1 wanes. elderly immunocompromised 1 able 2 produce effects 3 time stop faster replicating virulent Delta variant, hence breakthroughs.

Personally, I'm young mind boosters (I'm scheduled one today, least theory), think still fully clear much risk transmission younger vs older population yet. Evidence points weaker immune systems vulnerable breakthroughs worse outcomes. vaccine still notably reduces risk literally potential covid problems, including death, hospitalization, prolonged sickness, long Covid. also likely still reduces sickness transmissible windows significantly amount vaccinated. thought well know women stronger immune systems, related genes X chromossome. Women also autoimmune diseases ratio 2:1 men, that. Women got 2 X chromossomes, men one. Endemic means stay, like influenza.  idiots downvoting Yeah. Lots people aren’t experts simply contrarians like bang mistakes fail acknowledge successes, many many failures. 

Anyone who’s position expertise public gets derided like this. Hell I’m sure I’m guilty well so. stuff Fauci utterly mind blowing.

Walgreens seems willing combination - letting know. Well, lack confidence comes social media, valid it? certainly get medical advice social media. LOL I'm doubting guy good intentions, ain't working charity.  cares point biggest problem Russia unfortunately vaccine hesitancy. Even doctors tell patients vaccine number reasons, really shocker. work vaccines do. depend immune system mount maintain defense. also 100%, vaccines. virus overwhelm immune system response get virus, fighting chance antibodies have.

Natural immunity coronavirus seems wane quickly. Coronaviruses notorious that. engineered vaccine attempt improve natural immunity, medications are. span 3 weeks we've gone VRBPAC really wanting even recommend booster anyone 65 CDC saying may change definition ""fully vaccinated"" cover people received booster.

I understand recommendations change information becomes available, communication awful. anything gets communicated publicly asking ""how confident this?"" ""how likely change near future?"" incorporate communication.  ""Based information now, recommending X. However, situation fluid significant chance data may indicate \[something else\]. happen, change recommendation Y."" look like idiot (justifiably) 180 every weeks. really needs protocols place soon hospitals near limits admittance unvaccinated adults needs drop significantly, ICU resources need scrutinized. Keeping someone ECMO machine ventilator they're likely brain dead giving care patient stands higher chance surviving patient admitted earlier insane.  Besides mandates, y'all think main driver people getting first dose?

People lazy. brother waited last month literally lazy go since takes time day. 
  
I also co-worker similar, recently got vaccinated. anti-vac, get it, explain waited decided go get it, one day. 
  
I think people seem forget like 6 months since vaccine became available general public. like years something mother also sick. tested us, test came back positive covid. specificity rate test took 99.9% means 1/1000 positive results false. Since there's 3 us 3000 would inclined trust test results. know families say patient unable make decisions themselves. happening when, one article examples, patient agreed wanted put ventilator, patient's wife agree done? 

If conscious making decisions me. even happen?? I’m crazy wanting booster shot? covid vaccine rollout felt slight cold symptoms, got shots felt 5x worse actual virus. Im super good shape don’t want go vaccine awful. Trying go full Alberta, see. Yup! waste breathe ""arguing"" people lost reason long ago never ability begin with. 
AMA, sign it, GTFO, get $150,000+ bill. covid vaccines first released loads memes making fun mixing different vaccines. standard advice.

To clear, understanding FDA recommendation mix-and-match conclusion along lines ""uh, sure, see not"". Although unofficially, J&amp;J appears worse vaccine, mixing mRNA probably makes seems lack confidence vaccines make people cautious *mandating* everyone get them.

The concerns effectiveness, safety. vaccines less effective makes high uptake *more* important, less. (Although hopefully 3-dose effectiveness hold... we'll wait see that.) mom dad able get third shot (Moderna 3) early mom's oncologist recommended get booster early along members household. 

Anyway dad (healthy, 73 years old) virtually side effects first shot, mild soreness general malaise second, third kicked ass. laid days blanket, shivering sweating. 

FWIW booster ""full"" ""half"" dose got month ago. fair, large segment population uneducated morons would cut noses spite faces push comes shove. Mass psychosis.  get thousands even millions likes, talk. It’s misleading cited top line number, 90% doesn’t tell whole story. duration protection helps make decisions risk-benefit

Would vaccine provides 5 month orevention infection valuable? depends. type conspiracy happened early 1900s pandemics vaccines, well, large numbers, bug humanity, blame can't primarily placed internet. many humans earth we'd still easily wide spread conspiracy misinformation. seen recommendations get simultaneously, I, personally, adverse interactions. recovery similar second shot. Mild immune response day after. actual number covid deaths currently compared risks accept. Categorizing ""super low"" make sense. majority vaccinated. Sputnik exactly az clone. Sputnik V uses two different vectors, Sputnik light J&amp;J equivalent.

But given Russia's low vaccination rates, hard draw conclusions. could take look San Marino conclude Sputnik V works well delta, small sample size makes difficult draw conclusions too...

Regardless merits Sputnik V, though, production second dose seems lagging much going solve Russia's covid mess. father took 4 tests hospital.

You Covid-19 yet. That's great. assume rapid test. False negatives happen often enough. Keep mind. 

Unvaccinated people dying every day. Maybe get survive. Maybe get survive yet weeks, months, years problems thanks long covid. Maybe get die. Maybe *never* get it. true every vaccinated unvaccinated person alike.

However, unvaccinated means *more susceptible* getting Covid. means likely die get seriously I'll, *but also means* likely spread others, unvaccinated vaccinated alike, unvaccinated. Maybe spread young children immunocompromised family friends exposed virus. maybe person immunocompromised themselves. want risk killing someone life get vaccinated? could co-worker. co-worker's spouse child. mail delivery person. Someone store town. 

The virus also good time largely thanks unvaccinated, mutating every often spreads makes copies itself. know mutations lead: maybe something worse delta variant, maybe something bad all. 

tl;dr 1) circumstances unvaccinated, chance spread life. 2) Teenage Mutant Ninja Covid. 

If legitimately can't get vaccine reason, that's fine. 

If skipping scared, think conspiracy, hundred dumb shit reasons, part problem.  antivax sick father took covid test last week; showed positive.

If you’re healthy recently received booster, I’d say you’re likely okay visit them, nothing certain, could still catch mild infection, point consider friends family. annoying see number unvaccinated deaths article time period.

But people make claim contrary prevailing consensus based new evidence. even cause consensus shift, like myocarditis risk, transmission.

For record, took information context. quoted CDC, blame messaging public awful. news unvaccinated Minnesota thirty times likely die vaccinated. add, Fauci advising Presidents infectious diseases long time. first appointed current position head NIAID 1984, AIDS crisis blowing up. heavily criticized AIDS activists 1980s/early 1990s government's slow response HIV/AIDS, ""his work community eventually acknowledged. Kramer, spent years hating Fauci treatment HIV/AIDS epidemic, eventually called ""the true great hero"" among government officials AIDS crisis."" (from Wikipedia Fauci).

If seen video Trump press conferences back Spring 2020, Fauci might seen background facepalm. couldn’t paid enough live AZ pandemic. response pandemic embarrassing. People previous threads saying half dose.  Anyone getting moderna booster flu shot time? Anyone getting moderna booster flu shot time?     Wait, there's article?   get booster shot?

I’m 27, received doses moderna 2nd dose back early March. guess qualify underlying conditions I’m overweight high blood pressure. I’ve read moderna provides robust immunity vaccines I’m debating whether get not. I’m immunocompromised anything. need advice. Freaking little. 

Background: contracted COVID Labor Day weekend. fully vaxxed March. 

Currently: also vaccinated friend started showing symptoms morning, found hour ago tested positive. cut hair Wednesday afternoon. 

Should worried? odds contract soon? Cherry picking implies ignoring data goes trying prove. tests recent enough proof waning immunity simply yet. UK trouble idk would say country. guys 40-50k cases 100-200 deaths daily. country deaths 4000 cases.... Got Moderna morning J&amp;J March. excited didn’t sleep last night Many covidiots seem believe COVID exists, think vaccines evil disease serious. Many perfectly willing get monoclonal antibodies, fine pill. Yeah publish research results Facebook memes, independent thinkers verify share them? What's risk interacting unvaccinated people? brother law sister law refusing get vaccine. risk create loved ones seeing them? see see family can't yet get vaccinated, niece nephew?

I fully vaccinated. choosing put risk COVID, I'm going fight them, want inadvertently contribute risk anyone else know poor decisions.  CDC literally announced approval. Pharmacy companies update scheduling software update standing orders staffing administer vaccines. ""I want attitude"" ridiculous wait literally day allow things happen. Healthcare professionals bombarded right now. pharmacist administering vaccines daily since started. Let us get everything right made available you. going Reddit whining ""can't make appointments all"" literally approved ridiculous seem confusing two concepts:

1. Making claim contrary prevailing consensus
2. prevailing consensus shifting light new evidence

The people worried #1 absence know get arrogant like that. 

It's 2021, 700,000 Americans died, I'm argument Internet someone taking information context defend argument fundamentally misrepresents concept scientific consensus. Shit like killing people I'm 100% sick it.  really. 95% efficacy basically means vax people 95% lower risk getting Covid symptoms. way “getting covid” defined “a positive test” PLUS “atleast one symptom (even mild)”. 95% included asymptomatic cases per think logically. covid positive patient sneezes next droplets enter nose, virus enter system. Due vax even viral load low, might diagnosed positive even you’re asymptomatic. bunch asymptomatic ppl technically part 95% number don’t symptoms. vax world stops virus entering system (physically impossible), stops/ limits replicating proper immune response."
