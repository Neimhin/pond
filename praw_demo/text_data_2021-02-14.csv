*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Thanks. Look. Israel promised share health data citizens pfizer. Israel national health scheme works there. us even wanted couldn’t due fact many health companies private one make share anything. 
Pfizer agreed vaccinate Israel first desperately wanted data.
Its simple. US gives Israel country. included aid last stimulus package. know earmarked for?  Actually, false. Same, hope sub dies best way possible Stophavinganopinion lmao Christmas Trees, shopping person, gift exchanges, traveling holidays, family gatherings, ugly sweater parties, liquor stores, fireworks, bing drinking, New Year’s Eve party, nothing.... None vaccines. military defense deal. 

In words...false. ""You Indo-Iranian living west"". 

Your nationalism towards origin country would weird considering living western country would also weird cringe.

I re-iterating whatever said. First second shot? also prevents transmission.

Kinda sucks 5-10% vaccinated people vaccine effective go back completely normal virus still spread vaccinated people.

Basically, I'm working remotely come back office November. lease expiring next month. I'd like move uncle save rent months.

 However, health insurance tied current state, I'm sure. I'm pretty sure need resident state reason. I've thought getting PO Box here. Anyone figure something like might work? US $0 vaccines. 10% figures thrown around based self reporting that’s heavily biased long haulers far likely participate survey first place. It’s probably closer 1% truly random sample. Yes kinda are. see, one else thought “Jews greedy” reading this. you.  Measles crazy virulent vaccine definitely limits spread Spot on.

I've seen way much CCP positive ass kissing sub saying something negative China get downvoted. Yeah, it’s really tough know 4-5 people covid also opted vaccinated given chance. fact don’t know anyone declined pushed vaccine doses. folks work healthcare settings, could see might choose get vaccine potentially exposed variant. outperform...I don’t get you’re complaining about. things say shouod happen...are happening “You west must identity crisis”

Hows weather fantasy land? Gay frogs raining down? G-d bless Americans, everyone. False Pretty proactive total understatement. detest China open origins pandemic, definitely applaud handled initial outbreak. terrified unreal seeing videos people arrested brought quarentine centers, hospits built mere days, doorways wielded shut keep people divert flow traffic hallways, entire citites businesses fumigated God knows what, people arrested wearing masks.. people went hell back want believe control earned able return normalcy. unfortunately also believe way China handled virus possible America.. can't even tell people wear mask without getting yelled at, could imagine people would react getting dragged quarentine centers locked homes penalty law? Sure we've got large amount military enforce stuff people would fight back fast would unreal. wife Colombia December 2019, got mildly sick something, lost sense smell taste. know COVID, odd. Oof. bad move considering covid deniers probably use ""proof"" somehow How? second/third successful vaccination program. Look almost every country earth Definitely larger trend, reasonable concern point variant mutation becomes significantly resistant mRNA vaccines. think variants cause short stagnation fall new cases based vaccine rollout B117 affected countries' trends. said possible larger number -- likely severe cases noticed Chinese doctors early -- meant disease could hit estimated 1,000-plus people Wuhan December.

1k+ city 11M still ""early stage"" infection, matter title wants make scary. also supported number cases detected cities limited hundreds lockdown. includes mild cases since contact tracing done hypothetically, even testing (at least thousands one case). Almost cities built field hospitals larger wave, never put use. Beijing used quarantine international travelers later on.

Of course, covid become really scary stop spreading early stage. get respect get point. I’ve vaccine promoter family far convinced 4 family members get root misinformation videos would keep sending remenant.tv bullshit sources. 

It would interesting hear someone come say want numbers XYZ number say start lifting mask mandates Wrong, USA second/third successful vaccination program. We'll see grows. many immune advantage. Hospitalizations nearing spring summer peaks. Hopefully go even lower previous dips! Haha people awful, even sub see lot comments taking virus seriously saying fuck anyone everyone who's lost someone this. second best vaccination program world. complaining about?

אגב, אני בטוח שאתה כבר יודע שיש לפלסטינים ממשלה שלהם ומתחסנים בספוטניק של רוסיה. That's mean. wore mask 2019 circumstances get weird looks. Cool. Palestinians. china traced one case elevator transmission. One guy sneezed elevator. left. neighbor another floor came it. 

Bam neighbor got covid. never met sick guy. didn’t lie beginning.

Fauci said February last year “masks necessary majority American population *right now*.” 

Which accurate, bc wasn’t widespread Coronavirus USA time. 

That situation changed became active community spread USA. 

Also, time, didn’t know coronavirus airborne assumed spread similar means flu. 

The recommendations changed situation/understanding virus changed. live Sydney. man glad see 63k new cases US today. 2 days ago 104k. active cases curve declined, whereas daily new cases curve drop significantly. Hopefully things get even better now. redcoat you? Ah yes, rational logical pro-maskers... recent news coming France push new incest laws, might good thing. lasts less 10 days rate. Absolutely criminal. hasn’t confidenced yet? Two days? Fuck presume 'Three day Lockdown' going three day lockdown? radiologist Trinity medical Center Minot, ND national news talking ND worse place country COVID fear mongering people ICU 100% capacity truth 16% beds covid related.

A majority staff dealing 8 months people ignoring REAL health issues news told afraid, stay inside, avoid hospitals capacity.

So yes... Covid little mild annoyance... Due media. אירוני או לא? Same... also get feeling new administration trying play strategy make sense given past administration did, makes sense. Wrong right, Trump committed us strategy built partially obtaining herd immunity letting infection spread undeterred parts country lacked political lock-down. Regardless opinion it, happened. Biden needs play table, rather employ strategies make sense light past actions regard virus. agree, vaccine rollout depends state. federal level rules. Texas, guidelines 1B broad “precondition” counts. believe 1/3rd state’s population fall 1A 1B, means it’s going real risk people get vaccinated. Lockdown vaccines done?

UK done priority groups April still 21 million adults that, second doses too. Still awesome progress it'll like June first pass (plus 3 weeks build immunity) August/September adults doses. Still brilliant progress! hope someone love dies virus over. 100% infected, hit organ failure. Ez win gg 'awkward', deliberate ignorance.

People love cry terror something bad happens, someone useful, issues become memory past. Us today new cases 63k. 2 days ago 104k. Glad see vaccine ruling several countries might be, isn’t why. We’re better almost every country universal healthcare. two countries higher vaccinations per capita (referring full two dose regimen), UK would make 3 weren’t delaying second doses. Overall isn’t good argument universal healthcare. 

But good arguments. reality already pretty good sense vaccine reduce transmission considerably. Like 65 90%... Also doubt they're going lift mask mandates cases really drop down.

President Trump, Republican politicians, Fox commentators, corporations funded disinformation wanted employees work die continually lie public? It’s true don’t know things progress, policy makers need plan ahead much can.

I used visit British Columbia times year, miss terribly. borders open up, I’ll look forward drive north again. I’m trying make light situation, got third fourth paragraph fucking laughed. can’t convince we’re fucked simulation like plague inc anymore, whole pandemic surreal point. Wait summer think 65.000 cases big number Also unacceptable. Innocent proven guilty mean says.  gives lot information. title CBC article bit sensationalist, say least. 

""These concerns initially raised January, British government's New Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group presented initial data, suggesting cases B.1.1.7 likely deadlier non-variant cases, noted ""data accrue coming weeks, time analyses become definitive."" 

We still know. No. quality data works. would like voluntarily. government's business right forcefully. Ebola also easy catch, done much despite 50% mortality rate. NJ pretty good test case. basically opened eligibility half state 2 3 weeks ago it’s hard get appointment unless you’re tech savvy. I’ve able get like 20-30 appointments people obsessively following Facebook Twitter pages announce appointments come lot people it’s hard get appointments. way save lives give oldest first country.

Apparently US 7 variants Mutation, havent seen spike yet, doubt see one all. first days vaccine starts administered general population, hard think schedule appointment, due possible high demand?

If that's vaccinations per capita, fully vaccinated people per capita would even lower.

Use *your* critical thinking skills. exchange, one immigrant every shot! אני מצטער בכנות  definition people move states immediately buy place “locals” people whose family lived area generations rent whatever reason “outsiders” somehow. I’m pretty sure one alive agrees made definition. point, countries defeated virus say new cases. New Zealand day it, Singapore say it, Australia say extent. NEVER meant undetectable cases.

Even countries, community cases still flare back up. between, periods ""no new cases"".

NZ weeks could confidently say "" new cases"" would truth. China periods new cases.

I completely transparent fact consider worst case vaccination timeline. figures serve help build firm basis discussing timelines certainty “normality” must return. Yes, also said Covid would disappear news completely election over, are.... China admitted many months ago cases far higher counted, internal investigations says numbers much higher.

WTF difference make 5x 10x 10,000x ?

So true may still detectable, infectious COVID bits slick/glass/metal surface 28 days, surface would remain total darkness, undisturbed, without changes temperature humidity. Which, let's real, going happen things. real issue is:

[“Japan cautious vaccines, historically issues potential side effects,” said Haruka Sakamoto, public health researcher University Tokyo. “The government involved several lawsuits related issue, adds deep explained better do) NZ went lockdown March attempt flatten curve prevent hospitals going capacity. lifted lockdown April one since. I’m opening bars restrictions  Another reason study done one year ago exist outside America EU... Even though deliveries reduced, basically everything still imported EU Canada. recent list countries EU exported vaccines significant too: Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Japan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Oman, Panama, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom United States. People 20's 30's still carry heightened chance hospitalization death.

This true. No, it’s bleak. It’s great vaccinations rolling out. need vigilant assumption won’t new wave cases deaths come current one bit laughable. sound like joy.

That sounds like depressing, dehumanizing dystopia. one time...yes. US hotspot anymore though based 14 day trends Oh please god Eligible meaning 1a&amp;b people 16? ^in ^a ^few ^years seem ignore lot good news though. It’s bleak disagree whole-heartedly. government ""step in"" confine innocent virus going around. neither job business.

WW2 false equivalency. threat complete loss freedom Nazi empire, course people ok making sacrifices ensure continued freedom way life. threat death made people things, threat lost liberty. Now, ones threatening people's liberty government.

The 911 stuff also bullshit. Nobody ok either.

You never convince ok shit. Higher transmission thought due higher affinity virus receptor comment rational. 

The downvoting ludicrous. New Zealand focusing know based data have. called science. What's important make sure everyone get shot fully protected. anti-vaxxers keep dying every year, big deal. yeah man. like almost month long deal tired matter much slept. unreal. slowly went away got better. zero symptoms tho so. Idk. kinda doubt covid also riding bus several times day time knows, symptoms map thing. [Here] March telling people wear mask. Why? Bangladesh got million population 160 million much lower gdp per capita. 

It would look good give much larger doses already rich country. see controversial. 

By planning wedding (or funeral, sport event, etc...) country eradicated COVID assuming real risk entire country (or least city) go lockdown/shutdown mode even 1 person virus detected.

That's social contract Kiwis agreed to. want deal hassle? plan wedding everyone vaccinated, fiance/fiancee gonna break engagement wedding months/years now. fucking straw man! 

Wow. 


You're gonna great bud!  Maybe citizens pay tax dollars support military then? כוס אמא של ביבי canadian perspective meddling anything official level - Indian perspective - Canadians allowed Khalistanis institutional capture Sikh institutions Canada - khalistani separatist leaders' photos places Canadian gurudwaras sort Gurus. Certain politicians struggle call AI 182 bomber terrorist.

Within India Sikh separatist movement dead gone, largely largest victims separatists Sikhs - military action ended also led Sikhs - simple ""Hindu vs Sikh"" thing canadian khalistanis like believe. Canada thriving till date children Khalistanis, disproportionately emigrated time, raised healthy diet anti-Indian-ism, earn dollars main funders separatist drama happens Indian punjab.

If canadian government continues policy appeasement feigned ignorance step stop - eventually become issue. What? here. ... situations, goggles. lot easier say *did* whole wedding thing. important us people there. get pay big wedding even wanted. Yay nonrefundable deposits. 

I know coming nice place, advice helpful. Reddit tragedy comparing apples oranges here. injection large dose antigen via vaccine vs rather small dose live virus. There's really comparison here. virus waves evading immune system (through downregulation type IFN responses). vaccine induce immune response. antibodies present start, risk reinfection high. Antibodies coming bit later going necessarily help COVID-19 (as disease) hyperinflammatory disease largely caused body's response virus, virus itself. severe patients also highest level neutralizing antibodies also come fastest. Months? Pretty sure gonna need back up. already use combo vaccines. still guess wrong regularly could opened sooner, governments enjoyed newfound power bit much. implying Trump point time interest COVID? Also revealed: ONE TRICK Fauci HATES! Nonsensical. Agreed. hard enough get 80 year old grandpa cancer vaccine. helped non english speaking mom grandpa get vaccinated. easy. agreed able own. called many places able get appointment. ended refreshing site like trying get PS5.  100% guaranteed everyone going get covid, either ......right, nobody said 100% effective. 4 100k-120k people, FYI. 2 days I'll 7 days 2nd jab middle fingering COVID , hopefully forever. 
My second birthday! tax money buys Israeli taxs buy reason UK done giving first dose everyone “by autumn”? EU countries saying give second doses everyone end June, even much lower supply moment? expected delivery speed increase point UK? thought vaccines would mean international travel would open again? Except 4 people idk hope stays way you! know lots ppl lost sense smell taste &amp; slowly regained .. kinda wondering happen condition. interesting though anyone asked Coronavirus question? loves us, ask go away? I'm sure got sense people East Asian countries afraid virus. took seriously. doubt degree fear, everywhere ex. hoarding, harder acknowledge learn successes take stance mass-fear.  even remember wedding day.

SA rest original strain. second shot beat pretty good well 12 hours 12 hours either shoulder tiring anything bad. would second, course. mean, Australia 2 new locally acquired cases today.

We went full, normal, drug approval process (ostensibly, build community trust vaccine). dont trouble, yet started vaccinating (expected commence circa 28 February). Except Uighur Muslim concentration camp Disney films Mulan there.  son, 1A worker, fine first, severe chills day half second. rapidly felt better. lot states requring health insurances cover telemedicine appointments. may able get therapy doctor much away offer telemedicine appointments.  believe you. people commenting might bots know name place lockdown instituted concern hospital capacity? don’t remember where, another article said plotted time first vaccination, rates dropped less 1%. 

My understanding waiting till 10 days first vaccination compare rates improves rates tremendously. say wear rush buy them?  recall top head. That's what's happening reality though. Also would think understand lockdown I'm sure, got tested one negative.  Obesity isn’t nearly factor age diabetes are. Exactly $0 US aid goes healthcare sector. USA entire red list reminder grateful food buy full stores, job go to, family still alive healthy. posts reminded uncertainty felt days it’s still humbling. None felt like anything resembling certainty. Cool, thank you. 4 people actually doses vaccine still tested positive. “I don’t believe bc 0 anecdotal evidence happening, someone show [anecdotal] proof?” I’ve gotten 2 doses Pfizer vaccine.

Zero side effects. sore arm day doses.

I walked 30,000 steps day got 2nd dose felt nothing.

It’s approximately 3 days since 2nd dose. Still feel fine. really expect able get vaccine June. able states guessing that’s nice thought, I’m sure true many mental health professionals, I’m supposed therapy haven’t able months therapist longer works apparently it’s super easy right find replacement...lots burning out. think last December ( haha December 2019) USA red list, wtf. know sure. almost certainly effective much longer, scientists want lower guard without 100% sure. never eradicated, becomes another cold "" flu "" type illness due vaccine natural ways, matter cause kill you. end, suspect becomes that, sooner later  issue nothing abortion/my agenda. 

My issue adding born death statistics.

Edit add: statistic born = deaths often used anti-choice activists problematic past, totally unrelated becomes conveluted add born death statistics. ..... probably flu never go away, said that’s case... everyone bothered get shot. Hence, endemic. like covid be. Yep. make people feel like vaccines useless well guess what?

Discriminatory, dehumanizing - overwhelmingly disproportionate, like entire history measures governments enacted combat virus one study 1.2 million people died? Bullshit. Biontech's partnership Pfizer business decision. Trump locking pre-orders smart. EU move quick enough hard enough it. Let's get one thing straight, China. I'm pointing rubbish spouting.

Again, sequences talking wouldn't. rona, let’s rebuild civilization, people Obviously you’re New Jersey. There’s 26 year olds posting fucking Facebook getting vaccinated “work hospital” aka...am secretary work home since March. maliciousness blame China taking little action allowed pandemic spread already global anyone noticed anything.  Source - gut feeling based fear sensationalized media titles time. I’ve enough sodding house. utter shitshow terms COVID cases deaths. supposed help countries can’t help ourselves? faster get control US, faster help everybody else. shouldn’t worst country world deaths covid cases try help citizens first helping countries better off? Hurry up, must set permanent self-isolation containers make sure renew Netflix subscription surprising one specific virus it. given existing viruses, 7 billion people years time probable one mutates. Ok cool. Source? next line types? First oh noes antibodies gone months terrible completely blocked middle school biology!!!

Now it’s....you still spread vaccinated somehow completely different literally every virus vaccine ever developed human history.

What next?  ""SO MANY BUSINESS SUFFER"" said whilst painting everyone unsympathetic racist... I'm seeing things opening quicker less people dying UK since leaving EU. Maybe people wanted stay really care UK. never unavoidable, we’re talking virus, wildfire put out. stay us, probably evolve weaker strains time (as every virus does) and, coupled effective treatment protocols mass vaccinations, normalized. goal, zerocovid complete eradication virus pure fantasy. way get completely rid SARS-CoV-2 get rid humans planet aways going somewhere pocket, really goal pushing for. Agreed. California best example think of. Lots whining posturing lockdown little actual impact behaviors. Sorry folks Starbucks latte chai tea essential. STFH. article hardly discusses vaccination programs poor countries, talks vaccination efficiency league table. Astra Zeneca bad, Sinovac bad (quoting unqualified professional citing wrong numbers support claim), Sputnik ""accepted desperation"". ""Ohh, 'dogs'. Sure, like dags. like caravans more."" also found funny. Like seriously, 15m people 66m lives saved short span time, mention whatsoever. Even sub barely broke 1k upvotes. Pfizer offered 500M additional doses top 200M (300M) already ordered, France blocked made EU buy Sanofi vaccines instead. long time enough vaccines.

The EU finally ordered full 300M another 300M top, almost originally proposed number. Leave EU right thing running alternatives.

(Of course, given EU signed ""best effort"" contracts, anyone's guess _when_ deliveries arrive.) Probably Chinese data publish it. Update: got bad body aches, dizziness, fatigue second dose. Definitely positive effects covid prior Aww, sorry little Reddit man. hope big bad molecules don’t turn us 5 years! knows fucking horrors could cause!  vaccine it’s effective variant. Yet refuse vaccinate Palestinians  NZ already signed deals 20 million vaccine doses 4 different vaccines, including 7 million doses AZ. approved Pfizer vaccine far, others. 

June 2020 unacceptable response China. idea stonewalling virology abhorrent selfish. represent know. Tell us. ears, waiting tell world. China refusing release sequences China's eyes worthless, worth releasing.  China withholding sequences. must know. tell us why. reply observed, abhorrent. world blind blind.

And again, request, now, 8 months later, asks sequences. think important world. sent delegation discuss issue. 

Look China's press question sequences, China thinks pull political sidestep. China paints corner. rational objective nation state caught China's smokescreen irrelevance. China better think powerful. dishonesty come thank you. China's failure reply makes pariah state. That's stupid outcome China hiding sequences. Stop dramatic. think replied wrong comment then? poster said ""here USA barely vaccinated anyone"". studies aren’t yet. patient, they’re coming.  people stop getting covid.  French always rioting 1-day work week. collectively refuse vaccine, win never leave house. VIVA LA FRANCE! sure read person's post?

""here USA barely vaccinated anyone. Wtf government doing?""

Its true. 50 million doses barely anyone. country remotely comparable size anything like numbers US is. US health system joke, find astounding American act like current vaccination program far bad. many countries little zero progress vaccination program far.

Just bigger country, mean there's suddenly unlimited supply vaccines. naïve.

I'm saying US amazingly better, person literally said ""barely vaccinated anyone"" lol. planet even suggest that?! Australia paying quarantine costs defence forces budget.

Training exercises benefit military forces. Ok totally understand point view :) trying mold negative positive :) vaccine superior protection. danger anectotical bullshit. Take first vaccine can. get bein’ downvote-y mention it. us would miss soul experience, let loose, plug energy, freely connect people. reason believe millions died China. way could contained. regular flue affect human brain seek extra socializing (for flue spreading purposes), guess new virus could taken hints affect brainwork well. Thailand likely best country world handling covid. Due number planes coming directly wuhan year ago, horribly hard hit, wasn't.

My theory cleanliness really helped avoid lot worst Indeed. Many places estimating actual cases 5 10x higher recorded first wave.  I, Canadian - know, country mercy pharmaceutical companies

And Ursula Sea Witch. forget incompetent unelected aristocrat. worst treating wrong. putting people vents vents worst thing most. Since vents gone away almost one dying actually insane getting downvoted lol. really cannot understand mindset someone agrees China handles anything. choice matter. country, hairdressers closed since October, contacts outside household limited one ""cuddle contact"". yet suspicious number people seem haircut recently.

The idea government makes rules overly strict order arrive desired number contacts third population ignores them.

Same international travel. drive across border. government going do, place dragon's teeth thousand roads country? course, want potentially catch transfer deadly disease, travel year. Many people care. study rubbish. nothing tell us infectious virus. Let’s hope so. enough data age group I'm aware country denies people 40s.

If fear get covid comorbidities anything else, would take it. Personally I'll take first one I'll get offered. Everyone job okay first dose took two days second sick. I'm fond masks either, prevent listening good music friends ? remember seeing story COVID found Madrid sewage samples March April 2019.

Unless samples handled class 4 containment facility whole analysis life would think lot likely one infected person lab cross contaminated them. Nice story European union purchased 2 milliards vaccines doses least 6 different provider, Sanofi 300 millions dose EU one pre-command Sanofi, also united state example. 

I suppose everyone need scapegoat. serious concerns stuff (and italy cases october spain stuff august). 

At point, occams racor would point towards contamination samples pulling storage opposed magic infections months first wave pandemic somehow kill anybody. masked music festival?

Virtue-signalling? sham investigation!!!! article: ""The Wuhan Institute Virology open books patient details first 70 people fell sick COVID-19 denied. information patient zero,” Ms Markson said."" Uh, private company allowed export vaccines compensate manufacturing issues - that's literally export ban.

You hide many forms - Trump via executive order, UK hidden ""contract"" one seen far.

Then get waving ""oh spent lot money"", like EU spend money xD

Just it, stop virtue signaling. Yeah, Americans talk things like people countries here. Maybe latin America genetic weakness. read comments would think fringe position all, people constantly arguing fringe position. that's kind straw man. like upset black supremacy. I've met way people upset I've never met black supremacist ever. Even online. course aggrieved enjoy fighting fake things constantly bringing up. annoying actual thing pretending oppressed by. fake fight ghost problem. Yes. covid symptoms safe. Wear mask. Unfortunately, flu different beast. mutates rapidly previous antibodies (whether infection vaccination) work new strains. 

There flu vaccines works target parts virus mutate rapidly, early-stage clinical trials caveats. China goverment, would never support vaccines quit working, course action beyond that? Social distancing, lockdowns, masking forever? That’s sustainable. mounting evidence shows vaccinated prevents transmission real world, like viral load study - we're going see bet week. vaccine insanely effective virus, also still assist herd immunity, would almost make sense.

I think science important, think dot i's cross t's, I'll opinionated - pandemic toast. stark difference vaccinated non vaccinated populations deaths even severe cases covid, paint picture vaccine provide herd immunity. 

I know fear asymptomatic/presymptomatic spread beaten us - thing, vaccinated population level showing symptoms (yet). 

Look, imagine I'll convince that, begrudge fear, middle pandemic understandably many people... Hyper cautious, I'll say - think next week two, evidence overwhelming, also start feeling way do. I’m still dubious numbers China releases. handle now? Maybe - that’s also they’re authoritarian state kind stuff generally easier, population fear vanishing break rule. reaction shot 1 2. person lucky work. I've never side effects shots. Weird I'm cool it. Summer season effective actually. look Latin America Amazon Area.

The applies younger population. Latin American countries populations old deaths per capita extremely high.

The lockdown measures general population adhering rules credited. EU said back summer 2020 would expect doses produced EU fulfil EU contracts first would outrage. UK USA allowed manufacturers set supply chains meet contracts (such AZ factories UK EU).

Why would EU say that? private companies, operate global market, state owned companies. USA UK new China? EU signed contracts expected delivery times vaccine amounts.

The reality EU done - slapped export bans like UK USA, worse reason EU even bad situation it’s delays try get best deal possible (e.g AZ 3-4 months get factory set EU operating full capacity). spent long haggling price EU factories would probably operating capacity start year like UK ones dealt teething problems Q4 2020.

Haggling? Brexit media preached? LOL

The delays due liability clauses contracts, UK USA waved away, EU demanded accountability. personally can't wait return normality. year feels like 3 4 years. wife (special ed teacher) finally got appointment invite last night March 1st. really feels like we're home stretch now. Could snow storms contributing / contribute sharp fall cases? Yeah fucking vax efforts majority people stay home day big snow, virus little bodies infect. Blessing curse ig? think deserve get vaccines paid developed west do? - genuine question I'm trying go Three weeks wrong people?

This brain works:

When Western country reports real cases much higher: ""We know much new virus, many asymptomatic, can't test everyone short notice""

When China reports real cases much higher: ""This CPC coverup"" exactly. Many municipalities doses sitting unused cold storage right now. That's failure. think u/TheOwlMarble makes good point. got second dose (Moderna) time fiance (Pfizer) us spent anniversary vaccine-sick bed lol Fever, chills, myalgias, whole bit. like that, gone.

SARS1 pandemic joke Yes smallpox disease eradicated. kills 30% infected people children got died rate. 

It disease ever eradicated took heroic effort across generations.  love drama all. It’s fucking weird Exactly this. Even within states large cities supply rules. Pfizer Monday morning fear reminder. UK exported complete vaccines COVID yet (this might start happening next couple months) due smaller manufacturing operation Germany Belgium.

My point precisely.

Thank you, “But… fuck US.” sick medical issue doctors hospitals take care them. mental health issue take care other.  Thank You. guess know enough amount parameters action time makes hard.

But would different seasonal influenza? one person gets flu one season person got vaccinated, likely get bad illness following year assuming get vaccinated year?

Maybe two different compare...  I've using spray kinds --they alcohol based less sticky. confidence intervals indeed enormous, 100% claim always built newspaper level statistics, proper science. think something like 10 severe cases control group statistical power weak say least.

I mostly giving possible mechanism show could well happen theory. reality think extremely complicated lots effects adding up. gonna provide vaccine Palestinians curious ?  many American teachers, access vaccine seems depend less frontline educator it

Completely true. state already started vaccinating educators. Nearly option receive first shot/jab end month. Mine next week. sister lives next state state decided want vaccinate teachers. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can't complain kids receiving virtual instruction going vaccinate teachers. would honestly choose different workplace try keep masks long term.  Russian propaganda. used read Zero Hedge back 2005 majority things reported turned true. bit mor deadly new info CDC Alaska 17%. That’s ahead every state, getting 25%? CDC behind? It’s confusing. Don’t beat UNLESS workplace (a university) requires it, well might; they've extremely strict entire time. Well, cases dropping globally. quite possible understand what's happening. Eh, haven’t really watched CNN since obvious bias Bernie / Hilary primary. Lost lot cred then, haven’t really missed em UK exported complete vaccines COVID yet (this might start happening next couple months) due smaller manufacturing operation Germany Belgium.

What exported UK components make vaccines lipids Pfizer used European production. nobody seriously suggested banning vaccine exports EU UK. Anyone ignored understand vaccines made. Might ever changing depending availability. Probably paid less ---- could, extent (ie ""pick"" vaccine.

Not lot either imagine, but. fair, known missed infections may closer 1/2 level immunity. Thailand young population. Actually bit older USA.

I last year. definitely lockdown combined excellent mask use, plus little luck beginning. Well first used vaccine invented Germany.

Developing vaccine emphatically hard part. Producing scale **shared** American company.

No, BioNTech *partnered* American company capable producing vaccine scale. Pfizer reason many people received vaccine have.

If BioNTech partnered Pfizer, would *not* used vaccine right now, longshot. 37 years compared around 42 Europe North Asia.


If look covid statistics 5 years insignificant. even everyone vaccinated covid, would good keep wearing masks prevent 

Yeah, sorry, no. Sounds like old parking lot study determined takes statistically significant longer amount time someone leave parking spot another car waiting it. Who's we?  Difference CNN (reasonably) held higher standard within last decade. Malaysia temperature even humid probably meant per year, seeing second part sentence contradicts first.

""300-350k people die nursing homes every day, almost 1000 per day.""

Trying numbers yield 300000/365 = 821 deaths matches second part sentence. even make sense. CNN garbo. Yeah know. confirming again? Heaven rich good? go NZ understand not. Chicagoland large portions Lake's Michigan Beach inaccessible servants (us). gated communities go repairman only. east coast, ocean line accessible parks peasants. rest taken. good? I’m convinced mid December 2019. Fever, congestion, One worst coughs started dry became phlegmy time went wouldn’t go away weeks... finally got free antibody test community came back negative probably it’s 14 months. maybe really didn’t it. Since vents gone away almost one dying

You maybe tell someone then. colleagues must heard news, ~12k people dying every day worldwide (about 2.5k country). Cases falling falling fast. Vaccines seem work distribution going decently well, least lot places. many people freaking tf vArIeNtS? interview ABC News’ “This Week,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, confirmed U.K. variant B117’s virulence, study reportedly found 30-70% deadly. U.K. studied it. find transmits efficiently person person, really accounted big surge U.K.,” Fauci said. “But recent studies also indicate also bit deadly…It makes people sick it’s likely lead serious complications. 1/4 population vaccinated. Much different scenario. small tick, thats all. UK also biggest donator Covax committing around £550m. Thailand clean personal hygiene lacks behind Japan, Korea, Singapore etc. Thais normally relaxed comes complying covid measures....most ppl fully cooperate.

I think young population though...  see 11% anti-maskers here. Already did, Germany hard lock closing borders too.

There literally nothing else Netflix Chill, everything closed. Produced license. Biontech gets paid arrangement - know right?  add that, we've seen people (including husband's doctor!) suggest even everyone vaccinated covid, would good keep wearing masks prevent flu. never end unless people decide stop wearing them. isn’t CNN, it’s pretty much / big news sources Thailand bad, certainly ""cleaner"" countries got hit hard this. Maybe heat may helped. Perhaps that's what's keeping things control Vietnam Cambodia well?  resident developing country, would prefer dying, thanks. Especially first world promised us vaccines hoarded them. well yes Work fluency English first.  J&amp;j sold cost. side. hate idea seeing people masks wedding. outdoors? case, masks seem particularly unnecessary. know amino acid involved ACE2 receptor site apparently common cellular entry point. would guess amino related that. america bad git upd00ds plz   right direct fatalities, still argue hit population casualty, maybe better phrased: negative side effect.

It one off, problem, -20% level continues years (lets hope won't), would mean eventually 20% teachers fired jobless. 20% less kids need 20% less teachers. many consequences.

Usually though, like wars, baby boom makes loss population. Training exercises... happens every couple years. quit

The USA quitting become China's puppet completely reasonable form protest. rage quitting quit game opponent clearly cheating? thought cdc said there's need isolate vaccinated symptoms even exposed, led believe can't asymptomatic COVID. headline kinda seems disprove that? anyone know enough clarify? literally stepped outside months. Nice ad hominem attack though think it’s fine require planes people aren’t going go requiring entry places co vent upon vaccine status difference EU countries invest anything infrastructure needed mass produce vaccine. 
What happened EU pre purchased vaccines, member states invested infrastructure. basically EU focused purchasing vaccine, member states thought EU would also assure vaccines mass produced short notice.  

That's example happened UK. government pre purchased vaccine, also invested heavily infrastucture. viral codes, virus evolved, tell truth origin virus. China hiding codes rest world.  Every nation planet knows behavior reckless every human planet. Everyone China wants virus fully known competing laboratories companies explore stop prevent category virus ever blowing again. China single responsibility tell world. 

Don't expect China that. want discover right vax. efforts past produced vaxes 50% 76% effective. That's failure. could licensees vax that's 90 95% effective. Ask yourselves, happened.

Will China share earliest facts? 

I'm going walk around world. Let know 10 years that. ""Person chooses year life millions dead."" I’m trying pet venomous snakes shark tank dive year Latest “it’s month I’ve gotten second vaccination shot. leave house?” “Well, no, says Dr weirdo, eye doctor Phoenix” I'd imagine politicians try push mask mandates post-pandemic would hard time keeping office. vast work last year months 20% reduced hours, meant losing month income.

Was loss? Yes. Even though also free time (which use), still usual expenses: renting house (there 20% reduction there), gas, electricity, food, etc. tell also dip bit savings.

So yes, loss. We're literally 10x better Europe Canada Ridiculously hard. Late night early morning people awake best bet shocking China convict condemn 500 data points origin virus. actually think USA hoarding vaccines they're made American soil. They're made private sector companies all. 

Here's thing, US championed free-market global system given corporations unprecedented wealth power, equal even exceeding sovereign nations many cases. There's good (innovation, markets scale) bad (environmental ruin, crushing smaller competition) comes this. got two-way street. one able nationalize often-ruinous free-market forces gave corporations much power first place. going nationalize it, least allow IP patents free all.

At end day, USA still going Pfizer's #1 customer matter what. again, private sector company, people globe shares. set system rewards mega-corporations expense rest planet, seize control suits best. US play rules game. Read headline article thread posting in? Reported Corona data show impressive reduction new cases deaths. subreddit asking questions regarding Covid?

I want know marination salt kill Coronavirus?
I.e. buy marinated frozen fish danger infection? Anti-maskers need understand likely contributed someone's death. Contact tracing data around world consistently shows schools lower risk transmission many workplaces. Canada getting vaccines EU? Come USA better that!

Sounds like Canada country needs better Let get straight, mean tell China Russia lied numbers? pretty cool :) life placebo Hah, little Biden. already everything place already ramping vaccinations, continued so. 

If think new president make significant effect 3 weeks process that's put together 8 months, bit crazy. pandemic come control Biden helm, work Trump's administration.

The US administered 1/3 vaccine doses worldwide, program resounding success, try convince anyone that's Biden's doing. Perhaps would help told virus that...your attitude make laugh. virus virus does, strangely enough, doesn’t respond people declaring ‘its fair, supposed now’... EU failed getting vax rolled quickly

No vaccines = rollout. really simple. EU received less 5% vaccines total population. Whereas UK received much 70% vaccines total population. ""Worrying signs"" leave NZ want - getting home hard, though.

It mandatory isolate quarantine facility; home. certainly separate families - starters, kid tests positive, chances least close contact infected thus required isolate too.

But want turn two weeks free four/five star hotel meals included? Ah Sweden. Love whatever want do! bad choice given current situation there’s reason giving elders vaccine better option ‘no vaccine’ I'm optimistic pandemic. much restrictions. people saying masks every flu season. ""WORRYING SIGNS"" know what? Knock wood, I'm feeling optimistic. According daily cases US plummeting. ebb flow virus, hard drop-off since mid-January. vaccine rollout picking steam, single-dose J&amp;J vaccine going game-changer gets approved. get better out. Nobody getting de-vaccinated. 

I've made far, hold months. nice think everybody world team regarding ending pandemic. one benefits prolonging it. Except maybe people run Zoom, think political pull keep global pandemic going. talk whether open schools, whether double masks, think going become irrelevant sooner rather later. dunno, things general suck now. I'm feeling better long time. probably need be. also probably open back approved people somewhat younger 16. 500%? sure hope so! post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

We're supposed locked forever!!! can't immune virus!!! good point, however even AZ completely fails deliver anything delivered till now, EU able vaccinate every adult Moderna Pfizer alone autumn. EU messed up, speed pick eventually. could vaccine work well group people make severe cases, e.g. immunocompromised.

Say 6% population immunocompromised, (hypothetically) increases risk severe covid 33%. Let's assume vaccine useless 100% useful everyone else. get 94% efficiency covid 92% severe covid.

Something like happening fact rather expected, since getting severe covid probably correlates strongly responding well vaccine. Please see [our answers frequently asked questions [questions regarding COVID-19 comments containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

So, falling cases, deaths hospitalisations data? read Guardian mother works airport. mention speculation transmitted flight crew clothing. seen direct contact, COULD variant surface something. remember China tracing outbreak surface frozen food containers imported overseas. variant MIGHT turn extremely contagious indirectly. I'm glad always continue disinfect everything coming house. 0.4% old variants appears pretty optimistic estimate.

Some counties Germany already report 0.3% covid deaths among inhabitants (e.g. Görlitz: 0.346%). appear even close herd immunity, lots new cases reported every day Görlitz weeks lockdown.

So real IFR old variants probably closer 1%, least countries lots old people like Germany. better US, example, median age younger. US isn't. Spain isnt. Mauritius ans Cape Verde are.

Logic. Unlokely, early days. course not.

It's can't see people think future restrictions like put place permanently good thing, especially anything stop people dying this. much younger population most, alone would explain it. Vaccines people hopefully mean that.

Vaccines pipeline definitely don't. People know without good immune systems reaction. wise young people still something like 196 cases/100k/week, compared 142 UK 59 Germany. Australia really aced COVID response far tell. Early lockdown economic aid, returned almost normal daily life waiting vaccines. Enough make want move this... described freezer. Exactly, anyone applying realize need loans. Plenty studies done millennials able afford payments glut boomer houses coming younger generation arent interested in. kinds ""new mortgage products"" hitting street.

They'll still pretend like they're giving financial rectal exam though. know make enough, fall emotional rollercoaster trap they, reason, want people waiting approval. 

Even August 2019, called underwriter's bluff fucking hoop jumping asking docs already CAUSE BUSY WORKING. know, pay eventual mortgage would have? one banks reps kept asking thing ""cause underwriter wants now"" already particularly time sensitive day work, said ""I guess closing already scheduled canceled, cause told able play game week make sure asked last week. Oh well, bye.""

Surprise, found docs I'd already sent cancel shit. needed loan books. need loans cause Fed feed monster ink ledgers. suggest do? vaccines work, things improve, honestly expect people do? course, people want others die, also want live lives, social distance decades. That’s fair enough, don’t see keep mentioning EU army thread Covid vaccines. far, overwhelming majority cases ""wild"" variant. high risk B.1.1.7 variant. cases falling current lockdown, too.

Other variants present there, rare, they'd like keep way. sounds scary, Heilongjiang case, woman infected one person used elevators afterwards, downstairs apartment neighbor. 71 person headline really sensationalized. read study.

What happened was, one woman infects downstairs neighbor used elevator. ONE PERSON. Bad luck. happens.

*BUT* neighbor's mom visiting overnight. Mom later goes home boyfriend. days later, Mom Mom's Boyfriend go party. Party Host sons ends covid. Party Host hospitalized, transferred different hospital. 20 people catch Party Host first hospital. 28 people get second hospital. yes, technically outbreak ended infecting 71 people total. one person caught elevator.

So lesson still catching covid elevator ride rare. Extended family visits home high risk. Parties high risk. Health care workers unfortunately higher risk work environment. know already. downstairs neighbor visitors, NONE like 70 people would've infected.

Don't freak elevator buttons. wash hands people household. people keep getting sick dying expect people ignore fact? classic dishonest media article. Fauci responding idea would wear years, repeat word ""months"" emphasis instead 2 3 times... 5 times. CDC full shit. Airborne transmission confirmed studies widely accepted countries. Yes, exactly, finally someone gets it. America First! 

Screw countries possibility produces vaccines own.

But seriousness... Canada getting vaccines EU? Come USA better that!  That’s point appointments made doesn’t mean everyone able seen super soon. impossible stretch LOT would change then. I’ve seen tons people unable get second dose indefinitely first already strength reaction strength immunity? None I've seen documented, no. highly effective vaccine regardless. vaccines ineffective, honestly think keep restrictions end time? evidence knows hell they’re talking about. Yes, people might still want travel anyways. could international students going / returning new semester, well UK citizens overseas need get home. really isn’t choice cases, still take flight.  there’s correlation? Auckland August extended, far worse outbreak appears much worse position testing contact tracing. don’t people go NZ today happened one time quite concerning. Yikes. I'm young healthy I'm little worried second shot better alternative. Three weeks get first one. It’s like people already vaccinated going get free trip this. They’ll paying help keep struggling economies going.

And works businesses senior citizens frequenting?

That's right, young people yet vaccinated. means social interactions among group would increase, causing new rise cases, cause longer restrictions group able get shot yet.

Vaccine passports bad idea, vaccine readily available everyone. then, restrictions managed way entire population based case counts hospital occupancy rates. they're 80 though?

I mean still sucks, look bigger picture too. said. vaccinate again. never ending fight.

It’s vaccine nationalism counter productive. Said young privileged guy bothered restrictions can't party every week way would like to. Dont bother, comments folks right wing political motive. 

Last March ""let Granny die economy "" March ""well people immunity, end restrictions asap"" get 3 doses, 150% protection breath kill COVID contact! hyperimmune syndrome likely would’ve seen now. millions doses active pandemic. isn’t happening noticeable scale likely isn’t happening. we’re seeing fact opposite: massive reductions severe symptomatic illness astonishing drop death. still fully protected without showing side effects. people feel like worked immune response it. know make difference felt way last week got reaction 36 hours second dose. You’d think China would’ve better prepared something like considering original SARS Cov virus emerged China 2003.

In long interaction awareness Arabs, 40's forward, ignorant, bazaari's, also known Arab ""street"". mean little describing policy consequences. people like Arafat followers, never missed chance miss chance. Handed pearls, rejected political outcome never came pass never come pass. spite that, Palestine needs vax. 

Is fair say current administration, like one recently US, fail protect citizens political viewpoint, discounts value life itself? answer that.

Nobody addressing Palestine get drugs. offered truth; commit develop massive offshore gas field, already proven Russians. use collateral get vaccine. Palestine pay amount using field collateral. 

Here another chance miss chance. believe? Palestinian religionists going pass chance vax save people?

Or instead, shall call two posts ""rage"". smell bazaar. someone MA, kinda controversial, especially allowing healthy adults ahead essential workers like teachers. also likely delay drop 65, happen certain % 75+ vaccinated post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

I would love support restaurant shut followed orders. 

I probably never ever go gym again. hrm..... replied wrong spot. sub sub masks aspects. Sorry imply that. simply implies vaccines exported Biontech Moderna since January. 

EU officials already delved customs records find evidence AZ exporting EU, found nothing. Shhh 

This different US hospital data less 5% population second dose? US fell cliff too.

Also, average age falling hospital show anything? anything could show serious variant.

And another note, ""second dose begins""...what percentage population received second dose beginning drop? many past 2 weeks (looks like 0%)...I feel like guy grasping correlation here.

Both deaths new cases show real precipitous decline sync less-vaccinated countries like US UK. would EU give advance warning going block exports? That’s exactly USA UK (not UK blocking exports) would EU same?

Because every contract EU breached, vaccines rolling EU. EU give notice happens within borders, UK give advance warning - knew EU receiving orders made UK AZ claimed going fail delivery - **with 8 WEEKS NOTICE** - 70% order.

The outrage big pharma resonating Europeans, realized fucked big pharma seeing vaccines materials moving EU vaccines delivered. Every contract fulfilled, yet EU contracts missing deadlines deliveries, overall breach contractual obligations - hiding behind production problems, **when reality favoring contracts others**.

Somehow export controls, production yields started improve EU deliveries lol

Somehow **BioNTech longer exclusive deal Pfizer**, partened Sanofi pharmaceutical companies make BioNTech vaccines.

Enough fucking around EU, play games UK USA, behold, showing results. would guessed enforcing private companies export controls forced partner deals would yield proof due liability vaccines cost impact?

Yes, google delays liability - plenty articles FT, EU delayed signing contracts, delayed AZ setting factories led reduction available vaccines.

This bullshit lol, AZ flinch say deliver due delay, give notification would fail deliver ** 70 MILLION 100 MILLION ORDER 8 WEEKS NOTICE**, like realize would fail deliver 50% order lol I’m surprised.

This sub attractive target foreign disinformation campaigns. posts aren’t enough evidence themselves, daily threads got practically normal US e lect ion. 

The new normal crowd annoying. one wants pandemic continue. Everyone wants everything go back prepandemic, perhaps exception you’re sick public wear mask. Novavax trial indicated previous infection offered minimal protection B.1.351. supported largest European outbreak Ischgl, also large outbreak March. import Astrazeneka UK?

And like researchers released data, noting existence data mean I'm making validity judgement data. No. early. Later EU Canada. difference export ban. right here. lmao.

 
What I'm asking vaccine limits effects virus able break through. is, vaccine ""work"" person, least prevent severe symptoms and/or causing death. disappointed disgusted country, ""United"" States America, handled pandemic. feel truly sorry her, others like her. could done much better. Wtf?! Yeah, anti-China/Russia vaccines, US/UK ones. Trump signed executive order 8th December. Two months ago, one year. EU right ban export too. mean that’s better supply one wanting It'll end time covid 21 2022 reckon. two ""Brazil"" variants: B.1.1.28 (Rio) P.1 (Manaus). P.1 studied knowledge. Ahem... yo. 

&lt;cries option due refrigeration constraints government ordered fraction might need year (assuming due cost???)

Anyone else got ""extras""... contact Bahamian government please. Oh comment removed. Glad know mods took down. Maybe read something said 5%. Yes correct that. that's eligible book date yet. parts state group 1b others still 1a. part state open 1b. South Jersey open 1b. Yep hard quantify. However cases far prevalent among young currently vaccinated, elderly choice (i.e. long term care) isolating home. hopefully much overlap.

Everyone complains ""super spreader events"" people hanging beach such, increase spread also increases immunity among groups people generally younger. actually false. reason Canada struggling right PM made massive deals, countries getting later. Add Pfizer cut shipments anywhere 80-100% last 4 weeks could make upgrades plant Belgium (I think Belgium) could increase capacity 700m doses year. time Moderna also greatly reduced shipments us last month told far know.

TL;DR: US reason Canada struggling. Disagree completely, richer countries funded vaccination research distribution, get first. Disadvantaged not, want shot third world country, period. Sorry, get mad, choose, would choose life someone else ""Vietnam confirmed 40 coronavirus cases Hanoi northern Hai Duong Province Monday evening, putting tally new wave 677.

Two patients Hanoi 24-year-old woman Ba Dinh District 43-year-old Japanese man Somerset West Point hotel Tay Ho District, associated deceased Japanese man stayed hotel found dead confirmed Covid-19 patient Monday morning. cause death yet determined.

The two close contact deceased man meeting Feb. 2, according Hanoi Center Disease Control (CDC). treated National Hospital Tropical Diseases, according Ministry Health.

The deceased man quarantined two weeks upon entering HCMC Japan, time tested negative coronavirus twice. flew Hanoi February 1 found dead February 13.

Health Minister Nguyen Thanh Long said likely infected Hanoi.

Chu Xuan Dung, Hanoi's vice chairman, Monday ordered local authorities close street restaurants, coffee shops historical religious sites Tuesday prevent Covid-19 spread.

The 38 patients Hai Duong, close contacts previously confirmed coronavirus cases. treated local field hospitals.

Hai Duong, epicenter new coronavirus outbreak swept 13 cities provinces since late last month, would undergo social distancing starting Tuesday 15 days stem spread virus.

Minister Long said Monday meeting extinguishing outbreaks province, home two million people, difficult contact tracing testing carried fast enough.

Long said infection sources still lurk inside community despite authorities collected tested around 90,000 people, people getting infected faster could traced, tested isolated.

Mismanagement inside quarantine zones also issue, sheer number people inside zones combined improper quarantine procedures means cross-infections inside zones themselves, said.

As result, Long requested Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc put large centralized quarantine zones Hai Duong management army instead civilians.

Vietnam's total Covid-19 infection tally 2,269, including 690 active cases. Around 150,000 quarantine nationwide, either hospitals, quarantine zones home."" Positivity rate one metric. still decent one detect undercounting. starts climbing know likely missing cases. 

Infection levels still close highs back April July like woods yet, way better 5 weeks ago. love Ohio, read article. Dewine said teachers would start receiving vaccines February 1st. changed it, certain districts got week pushed back date several counties. article says districts going back deadline, March 1st, getting first dose week next. means fully vaccinated mid April. someone first dose mean safe building, need doses plus three weeks. Shame Dewine trying force teachers back unsafe situation fully vaccinated. March first goal, teachers prioritized first group, healthcare workers work home wait. They're restricting exports they're still exporting ingredients necessary vaccine production like lipids. Inform yourself. mean one openly admitted lying masks? Biden upheld it. sister NP Fort Worth agrees everything saying. think yes, least there’s nothing I’m aware CDC guidelines saying shouldn’t. already message doctor see there’s reason shouldn’t get second dose.

I got vaccine last minute, there’s free clinic upstairs building work, extra doses end day Friday got one. literally idea expect dose 1 prior infection (nothing paperwork warned dose 1 could worse before). Hopefully get info pcp whether still get dose 2. multiple models calculate R0 number chose one used. one certainly picked data wanted. Yes, crime. sweet fuck asking anyone knew any, Ill look global markets need vaccine different US hospital data less 5% population second dose? US fell cliff too. Reminds vaccine website go everyday listing many doses distributed/given. single comma anywhere risk factors. India higher population 60 US Nobody dismissing far see, legitimately scary shit insane thinking July ok?

No. rate things going, July better time last year.

Your friend wants stay inside there's vaccine 1-2 year olds? would mean another year two inside, that's generous. friend crazy. good newborns get sick, *kids* much less risk even get covid, that's *if*. July, pretty big ""if"" US vaccine rollout.

Also remember kids benefit happy fullfiled parents. Keeping inside years without risks mental health, kids. Unbelievable, unbelievable. yet, final stages weeks now. Could come day. still decent amount social distancing mask wearing. 

People forget herd immunity behavior dependent. people talk 70-90% herd immunity mean assuming behavioral interventions. place herd immunity threshold much lower. stable long term possible anti-social society 40-50% herd immunity threshold. 1 already publically announced Chinese cooperative.

Peter Daszak? He's one three listed article, conflict interest ridiculous every way: he's personal friends with, person technically employed, people he's investigating. He's public support them, called allegations lab leaks conspiracy theories Guardian Lancet.

Hopefully future countries go India Chinese genociders Canada approved AstraZeneca yet though? mean still possibility Earth flat? would accused hiding information. can’t win BiONTech need special ingredients US UK. 

Read FAQ. Ah yes, land Etizoilam. going make drug avail US? entire population vaccinated, probably never be, even years decades out, significant % population never take it. Polls show 35-50% people ""eager"" take another 20-30% ""wait see"" ""only required"". 100% even 70% vaccination artificial goal we'll never get to.

More important % population immune, already 35%, another 15% puts us 50%, somewhere around 60-70% enough immunity stop spread. vaccinating 1% every two days I'm optimistic 3-4 weeks we'll turning corner. Source? really think confirmation bias, source I'll gladly change tune. cant wait go visit Japan, always dream go  supposed get another dose? thought people covid supposed get one dose? side effects pretty common

They're immune system ramping up.

The EU supplying countries. Pfizer, private company, is. EU even sort contract Pfizer November 2020 smaller ""speedboat"" countries began July 2020. role EU plays preventing exports. opinions, wish would keep scientific proof. talks people assume it’s opinion. numbers it. many observed many developed symptomatic covid. data want? way put oxygen mask help neighbor oxygen mask. 

At least that's keep telling safety briefings airplane. Clinical trials != phase 1 trials, headline makes sound like way phase 3. I'd rather die Covid legacy leave world intact human rights. straw-man question, though: world without human rights affects every single person, Covid kills small minority. What's more, ways protect vulnerable people without ripping fabric society. Almost undoubtedly 

If test asymptomatic people rhe start , assume large number people asymptomaticaly. 

We also know spreading around world February 

When ""all over"" mass testing see actually find far people thus making CFR fall significantly thought AZ vaccine work new variants failure use many big words :/// hope we'll still able wear mandates lifted without getting guff it. I've really enjoyed wearing them. Well wouldn’t wanna take chances. SA variant already US. Shouldve back 2019 Hospitals going overrun point. Cases needed keep increasing happen, cases dramatically decreasing + vaccines + millions already infected + ridiculously cold weather discouraging people gathering buys time people get vaccinated get infected, main reason lockdowns (avoiding overrun hospitals) longer valid.

I'm still wearing mask indoor public places like grocery stores gas stations, I'll get vaccinated can, I'm done locking point. SA strain dominant time soon many countries - transmittable relatively speaking. Better retweet American teenager though, fucked. numbers, 65 get appointment. dad 73 there's basically news get one except ""after 75+ group"". time tell. Thankfully ticketmaster fiasco, really think it'll happen US. got reamed majority suggesting it. all, significant majority. 

Other countries, maybe. Yeah sure, also US joined WW late?

Who ungrateful now? Fantastic news. Measures like become imperative reopen travel across world. Vaccines pre-boarding testing make international travel safe again. Screw guy. Fauci national hero! NERVTAG update dated 11th February last week, confident increased fatalities Kent variant report weeks  definitely Oxford one South Africa stopped using. ineffective, ineffective mild disease. still works decently serious disease. mRNA vaccines like Pfizer seem work well it.

Failing see correlation here, maybe it’s DrUgS ruining feeble little brain can’t understand Dr. Dirtata, Reddit PhD virology epidemiology trying tell /: keep seeing reported data control group, faith based science point? Great tarpon fishing, also hump Islamorada awesome experience. Sailfish, Blackfin galore. keys wide open well, restrictions 38 mil gotten first dose, ~250 mil eligible. 

Assume 70-80% eligible people actually get vaccine (175-200M), consider people *eventually* get won’t super motivated sign get around 150M people w/ strong demand.

Subtract 38M already vaccinated= ~112M left w/ strong demand.

Assume Pfizer Moderna avg 1M 1st doses per day, would put us ~3.5 months away give first doses people.

Add J&amp;J vaccine, you’re looking anywhere 2–3 months demand vaccine dried up, depending many doses produce. ""Won"" Nah, weird all... standard geopolitics.

Why ties investigators never mentioned findings became public? one concerned ties reported findings West want hear. West simply looking excuse ignore scientific findings continue accuse China crime zero evidence. bet saying lot 2024. here. Oh fuck’s sake! Again1/3rd get vaccine, exactly get Tcell protection then? talking apples vs oranges.  learn change?

That's completely irrelevant, I'm trying get approval medicine EU. attempting upload data EMA online portal, I'd probably learned attempting upload said data, spend 5 minutes researching upload data would incredibly irresponsible right incompetent.

There’s always but. Jesus Christ, actually cared health virus 99% survival rate, wouldn’t asking dumbass questions like also temporary... like we're going wearing forever. think notion ""get it"" time perfectly valid.

I'm glad acceptable acknowledge plethora second order effects we'll experiencing years come. Call like, EU could made similar contracts didnt. EU trying penny pinch cost vaccine, $500 dose still would worth it.

There’s varying levels sports events too. talking arenas stadiums large cities, talking every kind sports venue? really necessary attendees half-full minor league baseball game April vaccinated? spectators high school sports? line?

Meanwhile workers need work. teacher shouldnt get vaccine now. obsessed hugging men? question China play western European rules. what!? America went still going nightmare own. 45% nation profound inability recognize scientific reality. China cheated time Opium trade.

He's sitting around spitballing colleagues. far know, think know least take vaccine. Unfortunately necessary vaccine voluntary. could theory deny vaccine get one want would greatly hinder vaccine rollout. Already 40% people registered vaccines show (this number probably improved though).

In practice, hard figure vaccine getting. pretty obvious trends location, age group on. state able calculate 41% 65 based latest numbers (it breaks numbers age group). limited 65+, healthcare essential workers would assume slightly higher states open groups lower even stricter states maybe average. spike holidays Wisconsin. Relative November would categorize enormous. small spike I'm curious, anyone filed workers comp claim got norovirus work made ill maybe even lost working time? suspect not. pretty common schools kids sick spreads like wildfire kids staff.

I imagine norovirus claim would denied would also denied reason. hospital run efficiently staff hospital, working home? Honest question. Vaccinating employees could represent opportunity return full continuity service quicker. thought. makes standard one?

Surely standard whichever country chooses use. UK standard schedule 12 weeks.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide pretty amazing. theory got pretty widespread amount immunity exposure, especially population centers, probably least 35% higher. Add 10-15% vaccinated we're getting 50%. think virus running people infect. Yes UK give advance warning. UK's agreement AZ gives UK first 100 million doses produced factories UK, funded UK govt. AZ well aware 3 months EU even signed deal meaning never impression UK factories could utilised EU, least well 2021. Therefore planned use factories EU meet contracts, however, due delays EU signing contract ability meet delivery schedules impacted.

If EU give notice expect outrage try block exports notice, especially exports company unrelated one EU disagreement with. Also said previously, added bonus try torch peace agreement time without even informing Irish govt.

"" Every contract fulfilled, yet EU contracts missing deadlines deliveries, overall breach contractual obligations - hiding behind production problems, **when reality favoring contracts others**. ""

This shows uninformed are. UK's first deliveries AZ due Q4 2020 (same amount time contract signed EU's first). first set deliveries supposed 30 million doses. end Q4, UK less 0.5 million. EU getting 40% contracted number doses much worse UK getting less 2%. UK, Canada etc. also suffering similar reductions EU Pfizer. overall completely uninformed topic.

"" Yes, google delays liability - plenty articles FT, etc. "" aren't. may say liability part entire reason claimed. provide link many.

"" bullshit lol, AZ flinch say deliver due delay, give notification would fail deliver **70 MILLION 100 MILLION ORDER 8 WEEKS NOTICE**, like realize would fail deliver 50% order lol - worry not, contract published production improved somehow. ""

No not. Yes inform EU late prove anything bullshit. UK factories also teething issues required working severely reduced initial deliveries sorted 2021 due extra 3 months. EU 3 months delays still impact. Production improved marginally, claiming publication contract real impact delusional. Production also going improve issues worked EU media claimed extra 8 million huge win despite still meaning missing 50%.

Overall argument based anger misinformation. started asking UK USA face outrage blocked exports (not UK done that) explained got angry. see informing companies customers intentions deserve outrage get. within borders mean act impunity face criticism global market. understand mature enough worth continuing. also basic misunderstanding facts delusion EU facing shortages reduced deliveries. simply case seems driving part anger.

Fed reading bullshit sub. widespread infection 11 months providing people antibodies vaccinations nearing 2M per day see getting worse? thought pfizer one.

This Oxford one Really? seems kind neutral. like moved argument exclusively children versus original post. science you.  Children 5, masks. Beyond community spread, mask up. things may required domestically probably big events like concerts conventions, makes sense. Theres going vaccine Gestapo pulling street show vaccine papers link says side effects noticably worse flu vaccine: rates side effects COVID vaccine: Notably, 2nd dose: 15% headache, 35 chills, 60% fatigue. can't find similar stats flu vaccine, unfortunately. can't imagine close that.

Anecdotally, whole work place get flu vaccine one ever calls work next day. lot people calling work vaccine second dose. that's point....you asked guy meant implementation explained it. even something months away, people still afraid implemented soon situation Governor Hee Haw big things Missouri. Let’s make distinction here. rando spouting numbers Twitter notoriety exposure, would agree you. However, it’s actual profession disseminate data coronavirus.

If you’re talking media spinning doom scenarios, yeah agree. previously infected, vaccinated.  never said lockdowns ‘made’ abusive ‘made’ already horrific situation thousand times worse. right, that's better fit. least agree here. think read novavax trial actually 2/3rds vaccine 1/3 placebo reason. line rising alcohol consumption. think lot mistrust stigma rooted time period Trump admin. instance, although Fauci didn’t cave much, health official US Dr. Deborah Birx **did** 

And consequently got flack appears contradictory statements made. India playing vaccine diplomacy pretty well. questing why? Don’t touch face. wear mask eye protection also stop touching mouth /eyes. Also hand sanitizer. thought main factor Attitudes like reason become global pandemic.

The reason became global pandemic highly contagious, novel coronavirus us existing immunity to. Yes, trusted Brits would play fairly like Swiss. Big mistake. hope, repeat it. transmission verified airborne. know, China want us think man-made virus (which probably isn't), opening records scrutiny. one time agree ""nothing hide"" mindset.

Because make conspiracy nuts think man-made pathogen. still less annoying 2% population die science yet know many long term effects. would rather put physical psychological discomfort return health care strangers well.

Masks easier live lockdowns kept herd immunity. Also still allowed medical fragile. Vaccines perfect, 1 20 still got sick studies. got kin cancer &amp; autoimmune disease plan masking even area gets lots people vaccinated never know person anti vaccine &amp; refused. willing go unmasked friends &amp; family know got vaccinated turn comes. completely made source. Get grip. three J&amp;J, Moderna Pfizer manage scale manufacturing planned, we'll likely enough every adult wants vaccine, quite enough every adult.  


Moderna expecting ship 100M April 1 another 100M July 1, probably \~130M April 30. Pfizer expecting ship 120M April 1 another 80M June 1, probably \~160M April 30. J&amp;J expecting ship 100M doses July 1, ship Q2, probably somewhere 40-50M range April 30 we're lucky. Pfizer/Moderna two-shot J&amp;J one, adds vaccines 50+(120+160)/2 = 190M adults. \~255M adults US, would enough 75% adults - around upper limit we're currently expecting initial vaccine adoption. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another x-factor: Pfizer Moderna currently trials children 12+ - likely finish time spring. that's case, another 25M children become eligible vaccine. Supply Novavax coming online around time could help ease potential spike demand. I’m glad loved ones got mRNA vaccines start giving junk. Rules thee me... remember we're ""aLl tOgEtHeR"" reasonable, still price. 

Liability equates risk, risk priced product. sit go, let's agree price say ""you take risk"", ""no you"" back forth pharma company said ""Ok"".

And, panning want money back, makes sense ordering tyres. I'm fan UK government, look ""no regrets"" policy took. recognised going losing money, know where, wanted fast possible, it, recognising cost peanuts compared cost 3 months deaths, economic pain.

And still account AZ, cost price, EU took risk. hell take 3 months negotiate, gave absolutely nothing terms EU leverage. Thanks info. Yes. civil (and sometimes religious) ceremony end day.

This space people consider COVID-19 serious threat, would rather deny existence screw others covidiocy. Attitudes like reason become global pandemic.

Sorry doesnt work way, instead painting UK villains, maybe asking EU commission doing. Rather fixing CDC saying vaccinated doesn’t need prerequisite returning classroom.

I happier asked die good economy Biden Trump. Yes hope idea people adopt done.

Feel cold coming on, mask respect others. Spousal abuse normal response situation, including pandemic. Nah Pfizer vaccines UK drop sky lol study involved vaccinated people revealed natural immunity lasts long time.

This small study suggests previous infections might help stimulate robust antibody response vaccine designed create robust antibody response. humble opinion, believe jumping conclusions implications response regards long-term immunity. strawman, false dichotomy. prioritize sending J&amp;J vaccine areas hard reach difficult storage/shipping requirements mRNA vaccines. Isolated rural communities need vaccines too. Many virtual academy teachers also teach person classes well. teach person school everyday. agree walnut Hills though. Customarily, people cover faces western world.

You aware customs completely arbitrary, right? change time?

And I'm even arguing need ""change"" customs. entire argument whole time wearing mask huge sacrifice we're making. nothing need write songs make movies future.

It's absolute minimum expected global pandemic. vaccine card says got Pfizer vaccine. informational hand given also says Pfizer. word biontech written anywhere it. 

Don’t know matters much it’s gonna happen. Customers willing pay it. research Goggles, huh? country 130M+ people that's virtually nothing. Mexico disastrous vaccine rollout far. Slowest response. I’ve heard Brexit bad Britain short term, potentially beneficial long term. someone knowledge shed light this? honestly know due enough data want bet life let's put way. important part ~~100%~~ 85% effective preventing severe cases 100% effective hospitalization deaths.

ftfy Yikes, that's nowhere near representative sample, even tests heavily targeted toward suspected cases exposed individuals. GOOD That’s extremely deviant voyeuristic behavior. Good thing you’re charge anything! wearing mask couple years ago kids dying flu? care them? minimize deaths. amount time could spend isolation would make hit wife.

Thats point, no, won't. tens thousands new strains, reinfections right back square use industrial might help world.

I doubt that, considering matters early stages pandemic, still counts as, coronavirus currently costing US 16 trillion dollars

That cost go longer rest world remains unvaccinated, idea strategy make ""cost"" go down, won't. economic costs mount everyone controlled 750 billion jack shit offset it.

Its enough send $2000-$2500 checks every single inhabitant prolonged lockdown would effective trying vaccinate everything open time, extremely healthy population much better lockdowns.

A healthy population achievable danger new variants gone, strategy lead that. good source AZ one wont provide protection severe illness SA variant others will?

That's completely fabricated mind. EU exports vaccines UK. Yes, fact. Why? believe this? Nah, dude. upholding government higher standards ignorant. Lol wut, source?  Thank much, hate toxic positivity around masks. hate COVID restrictions - distancing, temperature checks, masks, it.  Ah, see never kids before. nobody kids would make statement made.

That said, say issue leaving on, losing keeping clean. take eat play recess school disappear void. SMH... why! post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Oh nasal vaccine pseudo-science crap. UK ordered something like half billion vaccines. I'd hope divert surplus cousins like guys :) Wow what? Exactly, trumps gone, Covid gone, else going report on? Reading sub sure feel way, especially talk masking distancing vaccination. see stupid recommendation would undermine confidence recommendations? current rules indoor weddings Pennsylvania? Yeah, figured would try something like that. minor inconvenience unless like eating time sure, bring whole family dinner dine-in restaurants  Sweden. Hopefully see COVID black death. disease people mild symptoms extremely people infected expected die. Nothing throw away future children for. Tell take then.. Relevant username. great list articles topic reinfection here:  one many hundreds thousands people currently separated partner due COVID restrictions, I'd like clarify overwhelming sentiment I've seen, personally feel, sadness disappointment. 

We trying claim worse anyone else, asking pity. However, almost year since majority travel bans came place now, many means year since got physically partner. Several countries put exemptions place couples, providing couples give proof relationship still follow whatever testing quarantine requirement place, part couples forced apart barely acknowledged entire time.

Now, fair enough kind light hope end tunnel, stands timeline restrictions might end, anything, restrictions seem coming place every day. urge people, chance, look Love Tourism movement. group 40k members Facebook solid group users #LoveIsNotTourism hashtag Twitter. 

Again, one asking pity claiming worst situation world, year traumatic enough most, separated person love most, lowest moments, horrific. Read again. state government employee. decide go back normal. Vaccines give normal, government give normal. TAKE it.

So show responsibility protest show civil disobidience! Armchair scientist speaking slightly turn: 4x reduction viral load sounds great, difference 2 points cycle threshold reported study. sounds less great. People PCR positive cycle thresholds vary lot. one study (different population) top 33 66th percentiles cycle thresholds six points apart, 66th percentile 64x virus 33rd percentile. 4x less virus help global level, you’re around someone 64x producer (and that’s top third like top 1 percent) it’s still going bad. concrete don’t think 4x less virus means 4x less spread although expect help some. 

Not virologist I’m open correction that’s understanding field. making money president fair say well compensated...

As rest points boils ""Fauci unique, everyone else wrong!1!"" correct. responding someone asked point wrong specifics. think harder fake, probably via use international databases backup whatever end presenting customs/immigration called brainwashed cult behavior, NPC.

P.S. Notice correct use punctuation, idiot. 72% efficacy year ago single shot vaccine require special handling would heralded dream - hoping 50%

&amp;#x200B;

The fact mRNA vaccines darn good detract fact solid vaccine lot promise - likely lot good world. Even finish vaccinating quickly, vaccination widespread enough elsewhere people would want travel say vaccination mandatory enter. surprised becomes standard international travel practice anyway. UK funded development costs front risk licensed sold cost. Maybe take easy UK. one better articles production vaccines I've read, got 4 minutes spare click link. I'm talking about. *all* hate wearing them. people I'm talking ones wear We're going need high profile national figures making push ""new normal"" actually world COVID exists due vaccines mild annoyance virus, that's totally fine. 

The ""Zero COVID, Matter What"" crowd needs sit stop trying influence public policy. exactly. means ""oh time eat dick"" mine  History remembers results. people listened dingleberry that's recorded. think going hard impossible convince people JJ vaccine. People spent last months shitting Chinese vaccine based % efficacy alone, whilst ignoring fact vaccines prevent serious/deadly cases.

How convince public low efficacy actually okay, people would otherwise rightfully pissed could using Chinese vaccine weeks preventing deaths... Bit awkward situation? registration-wall hard paywall.  Regardless, work without registering use incognito mode browser. fails, use archive link: still fucking amazing number. Like enough get less vulnerable populations vaccinated really fast. Dunno, definitely case before:

* Approximately [100k Australia born USA (so, **1 \~3000** Americans moved Australia)
* Approximately 100k [Australia-born USA (so, **1 \~250** Australians moved US)

In words, Australians 10x likely move US way around. that's even counting fact moving Australia easier moving America! issue political pressure science support certain things pandemic. Dissenting thoughts even open discussion hypotheses legitimate scientists smothered ridiculed media establishment. 

Examples: Hydroxychloroquine, Covid origin, Mask efficacy 2300 die Saturday? world still shutdown? world hell living least I’m illiterate, lmao. It’s shame you’re downvoted... Lol. Ya got nothing.

Your lack knowledge subject, point called vaccine junk shows lack credibility. Probably shouldn’t sprouting clearly idea talking about.

But confidently wrong it! hail science! signed contract Ursula decided wait till November make decision reason. Anyone asking schools open asking schools open minimal safety measures place since despite anyone says reality schools open minimal safety measures place beyond safety theater. appreciate response hope readers well. clear, got vaccine chance. worry long term stuff likely won’t come in, well, long term. I’m saying understand people afraid. explain sped due near unlimited resources thrown mRNA vaccine tech studied much longer 10 months. Mods deleting many posts ccp, corruption thing reddit Oh 100%. anyone suggesting lift mask mandates year US? Sure, fell building, miss ground would still flying us day. Seems epidemiological equivalent ""he smelt it, dealt it."" never said hellhole. going information gave me. events, mask wearing hospital situation normal pues ni siquiera merecía el berrinche infantil que estás haciendo, pero aquí estás desgarrándote las vestiduras porque alguien le gusta el neoliberalismo versión cacas. least wasn’t eulogy Hard objectives? Nobody today going say, ""Masks gone July 31,"" or, ""When daily deaths reach X cases reach Y, throw mask trash."" still months point. understand anybody would expect guidance change cases still away places start mask mandates. seem closer end beginning, throwing people virus going delay normalcy everybody wants back. dastardly villian. It’s like people saw one tweet Pfizer exec Trump tried take (undue) credit vaccine thought “Trump suck” never read single article Yeah except part going get lot non-compliance... course! implied things could get worse :)

Sorry clear agree guy work exposed positive former coworker concert (let sentence sink in), whole family got months later still get it. Dude must kind natural immunity, he's exposed less 6 people close quarters get infected, spread us work knew first exposure.

Problem is, guy's 1 million (and may generous) case convinced many coworkers serious started parents grandparents drop dead covid. miracle outbreak department. arms current vaccines calling yourself. Illiteracy undermines credibility. Lol, yes. got that. enough yet. takes time resources make them. That's problem everyone, everywhere facing. really vaccine issue. issue everything. constructive point because, mentioned, really anyone's fault. passionate Donald Trump hater ever put ear corrupt correct. However, typical Donald Trump fashion, Donald Trump happen right totally missed opportunity tackle problem fix WHO. solution fix problem usual Donald Trump ""solution""; short sighted, idiotic clearly thought through.

The World needs WHO. organization needs around handle cross border health issues help coordinate broad health issues problems. corrupt trustworthy, US allies need clean bring back fold credible health organization. world wide health organization option. American can't go alone neither anyone else. pandemic made clear. So, Donald Trump genius spotting saying something, failed leader proper thing fix issue. would expect since Donald Trump can't fix anything. so. ask got numbers?

It’s called science, truth that’s repeatable. pick c every answer long life unless go politics. UN predicted several tens millions deaths starvation alone across globe developing nations. preventable cancer deaths deaths despair (suicides substance-related deaths) predicted impacted next 10-15 years. I’m glad you’re thinking US 2020 numbers.

Also, nice lie causes death. Heart disease cancer COVID. oppse them? mean one wants this...that made clear. to, mean want to. think correct first comment: adviser's job ""inform president knew virus"", also ""write instructions"" policy recommendations. Fauci's work latter area certainly deserving award.

That said, getting tragically bad policy recommendations absolve president portion responsibility. all, chose recommendations take. [Western listen West’s best scientists. could listen China’s best scientists. would introduce well-known source political could listen Hong Kong‘s best scientists—who somewhat outside Western Chinese distortion fields. Bureaucratically still doesn’t really work. Intellectually, let’s try see policy recommendations [on January 27, 20200], Dr. Leung thinks internal Chinese quarantine late. rest world, recommendation simple draconian measures limiting population mobility,” says Dr. Leung, Hong Kong’s top guy, virologist virus-fighter, “should taken immediately.” Ok using logic reason compare well countries Sweden then. actual infection mark probably 500Million 1 Billion real vaccines, none junk. save millions lives. It’s likely J J save most, likely go arms current vaccines.

What calling junk work horse pandemic. 

But please, tell us junk. It’s amusing. Yep.
“Coronaviruses general thought transmitted respiratory droplets, contact infected secretions, fecal-oral transmission...” quote link.

Droplet transmission airborne transmission. article helpful explaining US might exporting means they're producing locally taking doses produced EU.

""Producing locally"" ""importing EU"" mutually exclusive. article sources say US seems indeed importing Europe top production. checking sub thread ever since joined 10 days ago. I’m eligible, I’m gonna share feelings stuff.

So lots comments piqued interest. One talking feel sympathy anti-lockdowners anti-maskers. issue word anti-maskers broad definition. example, pro-lockdown people say anybody questioning effectiveness lockdowns mask mandates tries point negative effects either COVID denier anti-masker. one hand, question efficacy mask mandates (or question degree still know masks work). hand, question claims masks zero cost measure acknowledge negative effects masks. people, may seen anti-maskers, others, may seen pro-maskers. Imo, anti-maskers, reasonable anti-maskers, crazy anti-maskers. mask mandates short term, couple months. Plus, pro-vaccine reasonable reasons hate masks (i.e. : don’t believe masks stay older people/at risk people (except straight refuse vaccine) vaccinated), muh freedumbs dumb reasons.

Thanks coming TED talk. They've already loosened restrictions, suggestion make sense. ""New normal"" going happen anywhere country. yet Reddit constantly compare US New Zealand terms covid response despite obvious differences. care. Extremely weak justification. better approach seems use short term disability pay. short term disability, would need doctor determine sick go work. better jobs it. think California one state managed short term disability plan though cover self employed.

Well come tell governor Florida I’m teacher. 

My neighbor paperwork hospital. works home everyday, years. got vaccine. Teachers next group. problem amazing insight enough mRNA vaccines go around, know breakthrough vaccines incredible.

The choice J&amp;J NOTHING knows many months. I'll take 100% protection death 0% protection. understand based timeline.

The technology two decades making. Furthermore, main reasons clinical trials take long are:

1. Finding enough people volunteer phase

2. Waiting enough said volunteers get infected reasonable analysis made. 


In case vaccine, never wait find enough volunteers field next phase. ample numbers volunteers fill cohorts including special cases. .Additionally, contagiousness virus allowed us rapidly reach numbers reasonable establishing efficacy. time line shorter normal due short cuts taken FDA/researchers/etc. due enough people finish things. 

As safety, never better understanding safety vaccines. Starting clinical trial stage trials great job involving minorities, women, etc. groups important often under-represented clinical trials and, result, end often higher rates unexpected adverse reactions. Going beyond this, VSafe program given FDA unprecedented level near real-time visibility adverse reactions individual population level. level monitoring, visibility, etc. absolutely unprecedented. FDA data millions millions injections daily adverse reaction updates. Okay. still junk compared real vaccines, lmao.

Shawn Southwick King, estranged wife, initially pushed back speculation King died COVID-19.
""It infection, sepsis,"" told Entertainment Tonight in January. 

""He finally ready go, tell that. know, never wanted go, sweet little body just, hit many times many things, heard word COVID, hearts sunk,"" said Shawn.
She continued ""he beat it, take toll unrelated infection finally took him, boy, gonna go easily."" believe case *every* angle. Uhh Hoping vaccinate athletes games. pretty simple. hate wearing them. sucks. continue wear safe enough. That's it. much younger however vulnerable family members live me. wear mask school wear home fear passing family- since August. reached point could say fuck job move on. deaths COVID exceeded number deaths heart disease cancer America made covid number one cause death country dude It’s year several several months extremely vague there’s nothing indicate won’t keep pushing it. no, I’m gonna sit back start demanding/expecting exit strategy. vaccines. Time plan get us mitigation back normal. That’s stuff think deserve hear - doom gloom. IMHO, best could avoided getting fired skin ass. would’ve canned aggressively opposed Trump. Trump would’ve replaced batshit crazy loyalist, Fauci thought would result even deaths. 

I don’t think would’ve strength walk horrible tightrope 10 months. sounds miserable. guy damn saint. Absolutely. Especially consider got shots extra days build immune response.

There 1-3 day spike catch (from people can't get tested right now) overall drive cases ever slightly. Like see source that. numbers crunched (let know new info come update it).  


 US Vaccine Rollout Schedule:

* Dec - March: 220 million doses (120 Pfizer 100 Moderna - 110 million Americans
* April - May: 80M Pfizer doses 
* April - June: 100 million doses Moderna April - June: 110 million doses Novavax, goes well June-July: 100M Pfizer doses 
* July: 100M Moderna doses Feb-June: 100 million J&amp;J doses - 100 million Americans  * End March (220M doses; 110M people vaccinated) w/o J&amp;J

  * End July (600M doses; 300M people vaccinated) **w/o** J&amp;J/Novavax
  * USA 265 million Americans 16 years older 2018) mean 17k president Total population doesn’t account differences density, co-living behavior. can’t pick one factor disease humans vector -outside minks destroyed. Well said. It’s true. Imagine producing anything valuable life calling life changing (and saving) work done countless people smarter “junk”. Smells like someone knew covid19 way stated entertain ideas people call *conspiracy theory*... going happen. least, *shouldn't* happen. feel bad athletes, can't happen, since many countries get vaccine 2022 (which another rant entirely). Mexico 3 times population Canada, though, vaccination rate far very, bad. 

As Mexican living America Canadian friends, really hope Canada Mexico get together soon. 

Canada's victim past policies force rely countries vaccine supply; doubt they'll catch surpass US supply. 

As far Mexico.... president's response covid almost makes Trump look like superhero, includes preparing infrastructure knew going necessary vaccinate almost 130million people. Despite large well-developed metropolitan areas are, still largely developing nation going need help getting people vaccinated. that's even touching issue anti-science sentiment religious areas.


I TON faith Canada getting people vaccinated ASAP Mexico finishing 2023. like international travel, makes sense. think people worried would applied go restaurants sports stadiums. 

I obviously cannot wait get vaccine, part life returning normal means less government overreach. told wear mask day one, would you? No, sent entire world endless hysteria social interactions shunned upon maximizing infections death getting rid masks soon improve ""social wellbeing?"" Masks gone soon enough. US appears beginning end this, getting rid masks today makes longer painful. serious? I'll sure tell teachers soldiers. Cannon fodder. expect married one... way would wear pants, shorts. reading this. great day. Seriously.. Like get it, pandemic SUCKS. understand vaccine news along dropping numbers feels good terrible year put head sand assume we're end going make hurt much realize end this. worry mental health constantly post every bad news article ""this clicks"" ""we're beat might well ramp news machine"". truly believe things going get better get worse kinda positive thinking costs going ramp up, third wave.. us anticipating atleast easily able accept continue living without throw hope wind. fits suspicion Wuhan tried blame scapegoat instead considering nonstigmatized source. 

If historically typical pattern government ignores infectious epidemic, lies explodes, uses extreme measures shaming clean disease neglected. Buddy calling moron lmao. literally said **agree you. wear mask, I'm anti-mask**. I'm side everything besides fact everyone wearing mask immediately categorized pariah/social outcast. Since kind generalization ever good society? Holy shit literally say face ""I'm pro-mask, wear mask"", *still* can't grasp debate regarding masks rather, moron, many brain cells lose anyway.   Yes.

There really 3 different systems involved call taste: 

1) smell

2) flavour receptors (that pick sweet, salty, bitter, sour savoury/umami different parts tongue)

3) heat/touch receptors react burn chilli, cool mint fizz soda.

So definitely affected separately.  Smell definitely common issue.  I’ve seen reports people smell can’t feel burn chilli.  haven’t read anything specifically flavour loss haven’t looking.  thinking physiologically, I’d expect since flavour receptors focused different parts tongue, could affect focused one 5 flavours. really you.  Yes. fucking close. hold couple months, people. screw up! 300-350k every year day? Also, - globally? Good practice provide sources well. start sending countries we've finished vaccinating population, thanks. 25% Israel fully vaccinated. Another 20% one shot. Omg shocking totally predicted comments since LA never dropped 1k cases day damn that's going long way ship Racist, apartheid Israel withheld vaccine hundreds thousands oppressed human beings another act barbarism currupt, gangster zionist state. Keep mind rate vaccinations also increasing week week! Measles? could totally wrong. Israel good vaccinating people compared US?  sure start pandemic many talked national mask mandate, Federal property. 

I wonder brought more. people realize past weeks President can't actually that? cruel coincidence timing all. Would love see alternate timeline competent administration place. think culture US makes extremely difficult regardless who's office, trumps negligence probably led least 100k deaths. god you’re deranged! even combo AZ ZA based weak data there’s chance person room COVID breathed since COVID airborne People underestimate seriousness flu overestimate seriousness COVID people 60. something like flu mean necessarily joke. I've said I'm anti-mask several times... also said personally wear masks. genuinely understand hostile. point I'm going categorize someone wear mask infidel shit. I'm sure wearing mask help, I'm going act like thing helps though, going act life death someone wear them. 

The thing disagree idea anti-maskers treated pariahs. Jesus like want mad people. US americans stupid. It’s called tautology. people living area generations ones land Poverty that. wealthier people India tend pretty chunky. caginess around ""when"" I'm worried public policy related positions privately advising may another year this... guess personally see harm saying ""4-5 months"", also think that's near upper limit public's tolerance continue anyway additional incentive put reasonable, concrete date there. Wouldn’t UK figured out? Maybe virus hangs air longer? would hope so. That's immune system responding antigen would helpful forthcoming it. could mean two people room away we'd consider direct interaction.  can’t take anymore either unfortunately feelings won’t prevent getting spreading virus. vaccine staying home reliably. It’s 66%. big difference point concentration concentration along one largest land borders world, spanning several thousand km.

Either way, healthcare system much advanced (and public) compared US. find nationalism cringe

Ofcourse won't. Indian living west afterall. Identity crisis finest. Elaborate please  People always forget around 1/3 1/5 Americans already virus. They'll keep going long possibly can. troubling messaging coming media doom-mongers like Osterholm. frustrating. Mmm active fragilewhiteredditors nonewnormalban, how's weather Hong Kong?  story makes laugh: 90-year-old grandfather strolled local health department (small town Oklahoma) asking sign vaccine since isn’t computer literate. told get help family member. said family problems, guessed grandma “would die,” stormed off. Thank goodness someone called back, grandparents got first vaccine right then. #Gumption :: Cue pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel spew nothing positive results vaccines brought :: arent heavily upvoted? bad you’re guzzling 64oz-sized big gulps hopium people going stop wearing masks, state local govs going roll back restrictions, new variants going flourish we’ll back square one April. /s sold protecting everyone. strategy US flawed. First masks shut everything (except big business). masks random shutdowns. clear end goals, testing place, ppe wasn’t available etc.

Give everyone wants vaccine chance get one. call day. US maintains 2M doses per day isn’t far away. It’s thing. bitcoin GME bunch lucky idiots made killing producing nothing value. Don’t mistake luck competence.  bars closed part. can't go out, fun. meet women dating apps, one wants go out. do, one date meet park, sit six feet apart wear masks. ready shit done know least 10 people gotten shot one person mild fever body pain day two. rest us sore arms couple days. Speaking non anecdotally 9 percent people reported major symptoms. highest reported body pain/fatigue around like 2-3%. things like fever/chills much lower around 1 % iirc That’s Jared Kushner sold/gave Israel and/or UAE.  Hospitalization deaths dropping hard. 50+ deaths day ~30 Yikes Wearing mask crowded spaces absolutely socially acceptable EXCEPT sick try get others sick seriously immunocompromised. Afaik little it, even 1% cases This. It’s like nyc steroids try fight everything fail, kill dont see living world like this.

I 100% dead serious that.   US clear beginning, middle, end-game strategies day one. Messaging confusing based fact. First people told wear masks, masks suggested, made mandatory places. people kept moving around country. 

I would suggest contuing vaccine rollout everyone wants gotten it, say restrictions lifted.

Give clear end date goal. Agreed getting nose low bar that’s done, fit becomes important 

When go out, carefully fit, make sure clean shaven, n95 surgical top scientists article say directly. article junk. me. It’s one else cared. Also CDC already said 3 months vaccinated + 2 weeks don’t qtine xposure Okie dokie C’mon. economic impact felt decades. guys enter fall/winter. 

They pay price living country law enforcement enter private home without warrant order enforce lockdown. Vote Sikhs matter more. sane community little population would want separate India Pakistan. would turned dust. Covid Tracking Update: nearly 2,300. 7 day average cases 3,400. 7 day average deaths 16. highly likely, don’t yet know sure whether vaccine prevents transmission. difficult wrap head around. Ah yes, COVID Kim. rather unpopular 100 percent. Honestly, miss days could go 2+ weeks barely even check news.  agree this. don’t advocate permanent mask mandates restrictions. There’s point prevalence low enough vaccination rate high enough go back normal, that’s realistically going take least 4-5 months. Canadian PM, Justin Trudeau still sitting thumb give dang Canadians didn’t kill older people extreme numbers, could probably ignore altogether last year. 

In countries heavily impacted SARS MERS, pneumonia unknown reason cases thoroughly tested make sure ignored. weak virus ignored, long cause severe infection lung, discovered. Wuhan, around Xmas senior patients diagnosed pneumonia unknown reason. Bad news doom get clicks. That’s all. vast majority Canada's population lives along border. either way, New Jersey size area population Israel they're American average 15/100. Get it. got letter next line people vulnerable, even though young.

There's known long term effects vaccines they're quite new, there's lot knowledge vaccines applied these, conclusion they're safe. doubt, remember experts approved use, approved safety concerns. hard pass thanks asking Canada Western allies get vaccines from? People Republican states hardly bothered follow restrictions first place. people aren’t hospital Boy Scout troop sleepover. Even hospitals aren’t overwhelmed, removing restrictions early (such April, likely) result thousands otherwise preventable hospitalizations deaths. Freedom Safety.

I would rather die live cage (or government). median average. say average *age*, life expectancy. sooooo check urself. Righto. STFU conspiracy theory crap. Shutting questioning like trying really dangerous. nothing wrong trying understand data. parents in-laws got nothing sore arms them. Unless doctor says to, would get it. sent government location will?

Terrifying. empty platitudes indeed...  FAR worse U.S. sister working primary care office one person color works accepted vaccine. 100% decline rate among group terrify us. I'm glad mentioned unrealistically pessimistic scenarios, agree.

You explicitly say it, bet realize entire eligible population need vaccinated put behind us. vaccinated right folks, could done 15%. Realistically, probably around 25-30% population truly need vaccinated lower Covid common cold low impact influenza number annual deaths.

So that's 99 million highest end. gonna soon. Lockdown really applies Level 3 4. last Level 3 Auckland ended 30 August. Making fatality rate 500% lower then!  I'm VT we're expecting around foot snow day I'm supposed get second dose. I'm pretty pissed weather gods right now! anyone successfully rescheduled vaccination due inclement weather? I'm hoping they'd able push back day two - I'm really excited process complete feel much, much safer. could make combo vaccine effective wide variety strains since combine multiple mRNA strands one shot. They’re already planning pan coronavirus vaccine would effective every single coronavirus there. It’s game over, least respiratory viruses. know Kwikset lock? Maybe separated border crossing laws, genius. still confused headline reading five times. *citation needed. Sad general public regarded political bargaining chip lives expendable ‘working’ vaccine exists Thanks, cry sympathy statement actively want continue living, know many people would care.

I'm afraid living, partially around deal consequences partially would much rather rolled dice lived lockdown last year. However seem couple months end I'm making plans found commune anymore. That's happened family. grandmother 89 understand technology all, mom make appoint her. Eastern nations concept respect normalized wearing mask sick infect others. formed basis initial policies West, mask wearing normalized. One could easily hypothesize masks would also protect wearer specifically covid19, data exist make claim.  Literally countries exporting vaccines EU, India, China Russia.

The two, UK USA export bans vaccines, produce themselves, still get vaccines Europe. Black Death still around, killing people. I'm old enough remember SARS well lived close one major outbreaks, followed developments closely years afterward.

What like live close one major outbreaks? anything like worry way late many.

Yeah... governments still completely ignoring this, sigh. immune system result 500 million year long battle hosts parasites. bit complicated kwikset door lock.   comment linking marginalrevolution.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

People believe population large tolerate another year restrictions like ones denial. lot want Khalistan, independent Punjab state India, see Indian part India.

Fake news. spread falsehoods. generally like Dr. Topol, Tweet January 19th age 3rd monster surge. 4th surge, B.1.1.7 superspreader strain, starting next weeks. We're ready.  That's nowhere near much factor think. 

Firstly, Australia's population overwhelmingly packed major 5 cities relatively dense regions - see Victoria's second wave last year see virus spreads rapidly (until managed). Australia really different major states America - huge cities rural areas - practice, Australia pretty typical density.

Secondly, virus care size ocean. Australian's travel overseas regularly (over 10 million year) typically almost 10 million tourists year well. difference surrounded ocean all, difference shut *pivotal* border travel, state developed hotel quarantine system, organised federal government, isolate returning travellers 14 days. simple that. 

We thousands people week returning Australia, handful cases slip quickly traced stopped. Remember, America bordered two countries, border closed. Closed borders quarantine system difference, ocean. find much larger percentage US Indians middle upper class Hindu families stronger ties Republic India whilst people Indian descent commonwealth countries diverse religious, ethnic backgrounds may even links India post-partition think good guess people died hospitalized Covid vaccine. Also, guess auto accidents even deaths. Costco's 6 months hardware stores typically R/P variants painters such. think saying “gone” 2 months bit overly optimistic, think situation significantly improved timeframe. takes ~5-6 weeks person get full immunity, general public won’t access vaccine April, good portion population still vulnerable. It’ll probably also take couple months point reach 60-70%+ immunity point really crush virus. 

However...in 2 months, large portion vulnerable population protected, said. might see cases plateau, still see deaths hospitalizations drop considerably - already observed Israel. point, there’ll mainstream push away restrictions, IMO. We’re already seeing happen states.  That's great, asymptomatic Covid? B117 variant US showing, limited variant tracking, R(t) 1.2-1.4. tracks assumption 50% transmissible overall national R(t) 0.85. 


It's causing cases rise right now, can't \*that\* prevalent here.  rate vaccinating, able reduce 1.4 1 within 10 weeks worst (faster closer 1.2, and/or Johnson Johnson vaccine kicks us notch).  like would stay 1.4 9 weeks, 6 days. getting lower every day add immunity. 


So there's much window left B117 surge, every day see drops reverse themselves, window narrows even further. race, actually part forfeit, one look pace win.  Yeah, hard enough enforce masks rules it. 

Masks mandates go away eventually first thing chopping block.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* talking vaccines. 

r/lostredditors According COVID briefings estimating Summer early fall go back ""normal"".

If vaccinate people faster could happen sooner. long hospitals aren’t overwhelmed, matter Covid doesn’t go away? world learn live virus. No, 95% effective mRNA vaccine flu, correctly predict every single strain circulating every season also able predict mutations going pop up. Nope, gonna happen. 

AGAIN, mRNA *not* magic bullet 95% efficacy every single virus known man. general think there's going much hesitancy US people see friends family getting on. going hear specific number get certain percentage people vaccinated immunity ensure numbers fly back up. can't say cases go good. Mazel tov love Israel. 13 use reddit. Wait years vaccines. 

What Japanese?  getting information? I’m aware cases receiving vaccine caused death anyone. None deaths linked caused vaccine according sources find. fact vaccines prioritized old people. sadly old people die wide variety reasons. die soon getting vaccine mean caused it. vaccines. Finland. don’t blame . everything seems low income people , misstrust especially governments r/lostredditors I'm trying educate idiot.

Seems smart enough understand answer question. matter everyone vaccinated right away, need know risk levels are. instance, young children. won’t vaccinated 2022 2023, safe see vaccinated people meantime? Or, rest US literally plucking air lmao. I've it. take horrible 12 hours results EU shipping majority vaccine production rest world.

This comment prompted rebuttal. not, say practicing vaccine nationalism. Good thing least large countries that. Denver's wages better msot midwestern cities(it's midwest itself, though) Front Range worth expense living midwest cheaper either coast. There's reason CO outward flow destination west coast(cheaper wages high enough make better outcomes COL adjustment) midwest(better economic opportunities much better weather despite expensive) funerals! people aren’t supposed die now! /s Yes per capita. Try looking data stop making things Quit trying make mRNA magic bullet stop flu does- mutating often predicting yearly strains next season's vaccine difficult. Again, vaccine platform that's problem- VIRUS. Yeah, considering sociopath President lied disease, major party day refuses believe masks distancing limits spread virus, disease agency whose lab contaminated ruined early test kits, we're great. 
  
It reminds line, ""Other that, play, Mrs. Lincoln?""  
  
We're still losing 2500 people day disease. Compare South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, Vietnam, Australia we're 3rd world nation. Costco selling N95's bulk $3 apiece KN95's $1 apiece. Actually no, lockdowns are.

Given median age poorer countries tends significantly Covid threatening enough matter.

It's literally none factor. Interesting... could fomite transmission case. understanding tend rare. Like jail accused breaking laws? money bail? saw report dated declared pandemic, maybe Jan?, mentioned nothing COVID, showed hospitalizations winter flu-like sickness skyrocketed winter, like 10-fold increase expected average. saved that, suppose would easy enough find information. isn’t semantic debate. terms scientific definitions. either use defined you’re using incorrectly. 

There’s debate. 🙄

You’re simply wrong. Golly gee, ya think worldwide plague might making problems worse? Maybe enough wanna read about? survey saying uk residents dont believe rich countries taking vaccines specifically earmarked poor countries, vaccines bought rich countries diverted

 
Literally nothing said contradicts already stated. UK reason use supply fix EU's fucks ups.  Non mRNA vaccine also lot less effective COVID. I’d bet good money 95% effective mRNA vaccine flu. Apologies, completely agree rarely manually, hipster/foodie/whatever-you-call-it places pretty good it(10+min) appreciate someone ordering drink 21st century. shakers turned manager wrong. Yes, mean relative immunity sick. one said that. ways eliminate virus (several countries done unlike rest world restrictions) least open safely. governments care enough citizens that. thing care getting reelected. know basic laundry infection controls.

Not like virus transmitted via formites don’t live NY vacation spring break. traveling back home 3/12 got news Broadway closed. seen show night before. remember checking phone intermission night (3/11) email college classes online break notice. two days really hit me. Let's forget set place: AstraZeneca notified EU receive 70% vaccines, UK allowing vaccines moved UK.

So good EU tight leash this.

It's odd USA UK practice vaccine nationalism, one complains, EU puts export measure combat fraud, people countries complain? Wtf?  governments actually needs done this. Better late never. 18-24 month pandemic drastically changed way people lived worked going lasting societal changes.

Just like kind big event history. society changed September 11th, similar thing going happen here. sucked - past tense. worst behind us, end restrictions handful weeks away. source? Nope, don’t think all. fact, it’s one thing we’ve well with. That's true all. Flu mutates rapidly brand-new variants every year. Yearly flu vaccines guessing game strains circulating- that's efficacy averages 40%. Scientists often wrong (and/or correctly predict circulating viruses, mutate further). nothing vaccine platform used. mRNA magic bullet stop flu mutating. problem impairment, distraction drinking.  Trolling allowed subreddit That's really impressive knowing little month ago 300,000 cases.  Well aren’t 50 million people living Wuhan.

So would rather surprising. waiting trials Sanofi produce 100 million doses Pfizer, sure split evenly throught EU mostly France. No. family particular came nothing, many know. dad came country literally 20$ name. worked decades comfortable life extensive retirement account life insurance. know another guy came US illegally network smuggler ships. went originally India port Middle East, travelled across Africa land, set sail west African coast aiming Central America. got another boat somewhere South America (I can’t remember) hit Florida. told one boats filled water, Hispanic fishermen saved peoples lives. 

The point Indians got west easily thru daddy’s money sitting first class. nice day vaccinating 2m per day last 3 days. gonna go higher.

BTW 3m per day flu shots year. Ivermectin? It’s going summer joy regardless. Rona cancelled. Fucking bootlicking comments. People praising China lie entire world transmission, cause, case numbers actual fact pandemic spreading population.

As China restrict regional travel promote international travel already knowledge disease. 

As lie spread false numbers way save face. Ah yes praise locking citizens properly. Great jobs hero's. CCP paid internet influencers thread.

They responsible spread. Answers needed origins. Thanks! Great explanation, thanks taking time. 

Either way I'll take get obviously vaccine horse race pinnacle scientific achievement pretty fascinating. new superpower - dry palms stress :)  thought SC pretty light restrictions? Thats concerning sign... Regardless one's opinion, still early year; countries properly ramping vaccinations up. idea things going look like come Summer, I, Canadian - know, country mercy pharmaceutical companies - optimistic I'll able receive vaccination and, regardless vaccination becomes requirement, travel.  thought vaccines effective new strains included variants development. 🤷🏻‍♀️ still seems like astronomical number, welcome news. Without pandemic Trump panicking amount people think mandatory quarantine relatively harmless virus shocking That's click them. come comments. Ebola 50% mortality rate. 

COVID basically harmless people. waiting reaction. Nothing, see. Facebook Instagram would comments one wrote Trusting anyone appointed previous administration bad idea, (this guy said president trump “healthier was”), time, *was* essentially true masks wouldn’t help general population (since wasn’t community spread yet) *was* much important doctors masks. 

I agree though message clearly intended dissuade Americans buying masks, surgeon general clearly bending truth get desired outcome general public.  Nearly 12% US population least one dose 4.4% both. 

I'm sure getting figure less 1% Ok. many people died covid? many died vaccine? lol keep mentioning increased military spending, ""joined EU military"". point trying make this? People deep use anything proof. 

She get it. Bill Gate's kids getting vaccine?

She get it. See, Bill Gate's whole family it. doesnt either here... can’t change doses. ran large, successful phase 3 trial dosage. y’all like this? could stand reason higher viral load leads severe disease.  shouldn't. tactic pro-birthers use fluff death rate add abortion procedures list deaths dramatic effect. fact. numbers often wrong, HUGE percentage women abortion procedures keep going septic miscarriage. Deaths coming quite quickly last couple weeks? 3427 7 day average 27th Jan 2600 (down almost 25%)

The decline start 2 weeks cases though pretty standard tail usually bit longer they're referring to. Saying make Biden look better helluva stretch. job teach google Yeah. like 3 4 regular malls glued together now. Better going mall Vegas. live middle America masks social distance still waiting first wave. Says person source. She’s medical student clinical portion education, she’s alongside frontline healthcare workers across multiple disciplines, including emergency medicine. yep. I'm pretty sure company gives high quality fakes opposed real ones. don’t need “passport” fun lol Give couple years, maybe decade, you’ll basking warm Toronto sun India easily manufacturer vaccines pace greater use. use diplomatic reasons. China also vaccine EAU Canada. say 500% ?
if usa high china 4 times population, way hell 500% . LEAST 1000%

and lying regarding death numbers?

the thing people learn this. make changes doesnt happen again. ppe needed china give it. companies need distribute factories companies safety world. relying 1 country deliver ppe was/is huge mistake. Oh, thought Bajoran, Hebrew makes sense. live sheltered life. wedding dayyyy US: Hoarding vaccines around world.


Also US: Look 130 countries even started vacinnating guess lesson learned far seems pretty easy overwhelm hospital system. I'd say notable. Deaths going down. likely take full month reflect current trend.  viral load higher variant make fomite transmission likely. Probably didn’t graduate near top class. visit people, restaurants, stores choose to. allowed. all. FaceTime, texting, social media keep us connected. don't. I'm really freaking tired home family, I'm thrilled grandmother able get vaccine leave room. sound like selfish brat. Jeez, that's nuts.. Probably recognize anymore. vague terminology 'over'

Obviously people covid 2022 clue definition agree said, overarching defense production act type campaign.

Like work biopharm many years. approached lend assistance vaccine roll (from GMP manufacturing quality perspective), wouldnt flinch. havnt heard anyone getting recruited. diseases work important, killed 500,000 americans last 11 months. Yes, fact contagious lethal worrisome. Vaccines best chance avoid another year mess. Go Grandpa!!! Remindme! 2 March 2021 Flu mostly transmitted droplets fomites (touching common surfaces), hence “keep 6 feet wash hands” advice came beginning. 

There mountain evidence Covid isn’t spread droplets, rather aerosols, flu basically non-existent year covid still spreading. understand correctly, still spread children able receive vaccine, correct? make virus? brain hurts you’re experiencing need see someone see them. 

Most good therapists would understand told hold you. 

New old. It’s exacerbated feelings loneliness, grief, loss, etc. 

As someone whose seen therapist long time deal stuff suspect sometimes year much easier mental health lot others need senior centers them. live alone, aide could take roll China afford give vaccine can. US can't people dying left right. separatists. vast majority Sikhs 95%+ happy part India. Oh no. Anyway. blaming scapegoat base conclusion limited evidence? vide version suggested wet market lab, hybrid theory. China could cooperated, transparent. Yeah, mixed bag sure figures I've heard we've 30 million confirmed infections, true total probably closer 100 million. 

We've administered 51 million doses, 30 million people first dose, another 10 million doses.

So thats ~110 million strong immunity plus another 30 million partial immunity get full immunity soon. 

Also believe takes ~5 weeks infection death (for people die. factor too. 

It takes 4-6 weeks first injection protected Covid, another ~5 weeks infection death, ideally see major drops death rate March April. I'm Bihari, whole family lives US. love Modi he's India. hard-line BJP supporters even though live India. politicians using nationalism spike support power, caring consequences. live India know I’m isn’t much Canada damn neighbors south..

""Seriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS! effective preventing general public catching #Coronavirus, healthcare providers can’t get care sick patients, puts communities risk!""

(Of course, correct second part, first part concerns me.) Covid never gone, within months enough immunity population vaccines infections pose level risk flu. There's major huge difference ""int'l travel instances requiring one vaccine already do"", ""dude stops movie theater asks vaccine papers"". 2nd acute incursion daily life unfortunate historical precedents (yellow fever New Orleans 1800s immunity passports), major civil liberties concerns- that's taking off. 1st realistic. studies coming suggest otherwise okay.

Sources?

This work anyone way feel completely understandable.

That's going work. people ignore buy whatever N95/KN95/etc. equivalents get hands on. going last. Now, asking ""will covid completely gone"", no, it'll nuisance like flu every often, eventually world move on, like Spanish flu (which far worse btw).

So, need upset :) Yeah SC issue. trying help reenactors states organize covid-safe living history programs got bunch flak people 'irresponsible' ever step foot China realise 'police state' propaganda bullshit. fact police like friendly neighborhood friend muderous thugs guns like US. clarify, I'm person originally talking to. sniped comment second one. Might change anything, want clear previous ""agenda"" might seen me. 

My point they're *fatalities*. Average number births, projected births, never 100% accurate. 20% huge deviation, know normal, mean anyone died. 

The quote give indicates overall number abortions *not* increase. I'd argue good, people appear terminating often usual, expressing concern (which totally valid). 

Looping back: 

The pandemic kill 20% babies. People chose less babies, think agree, agree including reduction ""toll"" pandemic. 

It's similar problem with, example, comorbidities. Let's say get COVID exacerbates issue had, disease caused virus direct cause death. countries counting caused COVID19. People less babies, COVID19 virus/disease specifically stopping babies, causing caution. No, wasn't.

He could done exactly ended done....telling people use cloth. People sew turned huge number cloth masks. guess don’t believe virus eliminated countries already widespread. I’m fine that! Let’s give vaccines many people possible go back living, accepting small amount extra risk. time, Covid may become another cold virus. Better yet, remove US troops countries entirely? family dead already. Covid, it, 2 years would pretty nice.

How fucked head want vaccines go likely die (by HUGE HUGE HUGE margin). Like... wrong you? 

You need help. I’m sorry hear this! wonder fiancé FMIL actually leave personal choice guest. Yeah, fantastic 2 vaccines high efficacy. yes, already mentioned, platform easily adapted different vaccine candidates. I'm dissing technology. can't blindly assume future mRNA vaccines automatically high efficacy they're using technology. surprise Pfizer Moderna vaccines similar efficacy- they're using vaccine platform make mRNA viral spike protein.

I've actually worked vaccine trials lab mRNA technology developed. I've seen mRNA candidates fail. believe data make blind assumptions generalize- that's vaccinology works. catch every last case centralize quarantine.

So far one candidate phase III trials demonstrated non-inferiority versus seasonal flu vaccine. I'd encouraged if/when data showing works significantly BETTER current vaccines. Pre-print data Oxford Lancet couple weeks back showing 76% efficacy one shot 22 days, 82% second shot 12 weeks. Data UK, Brazil, South Africa (though it’s shown miserable SA variant), around 20k participants. It’s slower kick mRNA ones, credit first they’ve really set high bar. [The flu vaccine 2018 30-60% one kicked stink job. Oxford/AZ shot fine original UK strains, based current data.

Oxford/AZ sources: leader like Jacinda.

Go look stats housing affordability, domestic violence child poverty vaccine Us getting Europe? we're testing higher rates summer well vaccine market right widespread government approvals highly effective, even compared common vaccines prevent resurgences horrible diseases, many worse Covid. mRNA technology blows every vaccine history water, Oxford vaccine compared...yeah, like silver medalist Olympics...you're still podium. Cultures different. That's okay. need force cultural shift people take open beverage containers cars them. That's kind low priority issue. three days, government chips lost income Follow twitter notifications best way finding appointments especially parents aren’t county isn’t restricting appointments residents/workers trump definitely censored content (likely outright edited suppressed) US states like Florida New York currently involved scandals.

What even talking about? get old people vaccinated time monsoon season rolls around good position Vaccine hesitancy going interesting next months worldwide. ""I believe Science!"" Brigade, actually much science digested. mostly believing scientists actual data. humans easily distrusted people already trust authority.

Feel free correct I'm wrong able find actual data trials. Maybe considered commercially sensitive? think clarification needs REALLLLLLLLLY cold weather. Cold weather awful virus cuz people huddle around doors go parties places instead beach park whatever. cold people leaving houses period, great. Maps. That's history origin virus.

Just maps.  youre posting data point please provide source Drinking driving illegal Europe, far know, able take drinks seem make problem worse. 

The US problem drinking driving, much like guns solution strictly take away. systemic issue needs dealt cultural level. saying ""you can't take booze leave"" stop people getting car drunk. like saying ""you're supposed shoot people"" stop someone so. 

You need education, strong cultural direction shift, proper awareness. Obviously strong legal response someone cross boundary important too. People trusted things, need taught first. they? decided. :(  Antivax != Vaccine hesitant lol.

It's sad point. almost like one worst hit place huge population needs lot vaccines quickly.

Really makes think. 🤔 Mexico getting lot manufacturing. uncle works consultant manufacturing plants. Says costs production Mexico extremely competitive, shipping US also much easier. Interesting. wonder means could potentially used treatment well. i.e. someone tests positive, give vaccine?

Obviously would need studied (and maybe biology experts explain if/why bad idea outright), given supply limited, might potentially save lot lives widespread vaccination achieved. tasteless. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Sorry, dead man vaccines promised government way out, longer go back that. end year one way another. vaccines likely still effective even they’re people going start this. That, along every time reproduces inside someone. Prolonged covid infection immunosuppressed patients one theories virus accumulated many mutations first place. single country Europe sent direct stimulus checks. also didn’t leading immunologist advising people wear masks. Please tell you’re satirical. Florida wide open, weather great, cases dropping too. Haha. USA fault producing vaccinating citizens now? Jesus Christ US never win sometimes Neck beards? mean vaccine may longer effective 3+ months? parents 70 Texas still can't get appointment. doubt it, US least pretty much everything back normal time summer. nice try  ""Coronials"". There's trend name generations play previous ones, least people like ""This really stupid name. Let's call us something else instead."" Hence Millenials ""Gen-Y"" ""Echo Boomers"" became ""Millenials"", generation called ""Gen-Z"" ""Zoomers"". online shopping grocery store. Definitely can't work home. employees required wear masks since beginning. strongly suggested customers wear masks, required mask mandate went effect. Even though required, many customers wear masks offering free mask allowed say anything it. company want us get hurt angry customers refuse wear masks. happened companies states. 

I staff comes house couple times week help tasks daily living. also attend day program week. day program shut twice extended period time Covid. staff still come house, supposed wear masks. day program meeting, also wear masks get temperature checked entering class. 

Now restrictions lifted, worried mask requirements lifted staff day program. know staff eager ditch masks day program instructor. course, main staff mask fit well never covers nose. wearing mask might make difference. don’t know expecting “Google it” wrong. Sorry dude. EU going come united strong. Southern Europe already hates fiscal Germany. schengen area means jack shit that’s one less incentive play ball. Mama Merkel what’s best Germany countries suffer lot allies want US troops country, bigger military aid defending deterring attacks present. We're occupying troops present.

Not great amount, certain factories moving anyway continue pace mass exodus none countries established supply chain. way guess owns many factories companies moving longer buy onlne there.

Good you, make difference. Come back tell years time still same, be.

The rest comment quite hard comprehend, maybe taken breather infected 4000 deaths

Yes case realize study, like others China done show actual case numbers quite bit higher, hardly surprising really novel coronavirus particularly hard spot,. known health care system wuhan brink collapsing. Pretty hard keep accurate numbers dont mass build hospitals days deal 90000 infected

No, build isolate infected, quickest way stopping community spread. worked 450000 infected 6000 deaths hospitals.

Hence massive ongoing community spread. Countries isolated patients possible infected magnitudes less infections didn't, like example, uncontrolled spread. Strange works. Cool, thank you. damned, trust man lies public? bound whenever feels best interest.  guys hate news like There's lot insane people sub.

Sorta. definitely deadly spreads easily, little effect efficacy vaccines. Whereas SA variant shown reduce efficacy many vaccines. Yep. time take care first rest world. government’s top priority needs serving citizens time crisis. countries europe, australia, nz. 

Pull head out. Pfizer plants Europe. I'm sure US getting supply there. There's also Pfizer plant Michigan. Let’s hope people don’t get tired lockdowns vaccines continue help They're spiking individually, 8x increase UK variant month Florida iirc, drowned OG substantial lead fall. Hard know end causing much problem, still worth continuing watch. as? Legitimatly can’t stand politicization either side it’s completely fabricated shit. Stirring pot bullhsit tribal left versus right, non partisan scientific vaccine rollout success harmful

We celebrating even win partisan presidents still work successfully solve emergencies actually Uh.....literally scores them? want risk death severe long-term health consequences, mean. mean, I'd reshuffle residents who'd prefer live longer (especially longer expected remaining lifespan) choose go nursing homes stricter rules safety, would probably die soon anyways hence want looser restrictions, go ones special restrictions. whatever reason, people power decide go route.

But really, people can't use messaging apps stuff? decide learn stuff? expensive? funds raise money help communications people nursing homes, I'm sure people would supportive. like +10000 deaths? Lol. Теперь посмотри на Россию. It’s month since people vaccinated. Isn’t little early? Sundays Mondays generally lowest number cases. we're ~80k Tuesday I'll take huge win think absolutely reasonable. bit bullet, right things kept COVID bay. valid pain pay price, also reduce wedding funeral whatnot.

Who cares rest world shown clearly can't handle shit all, skipped leg day government, mofokers. mean insane. gonna 12 degrees Houston, HOUSTON!! UK isn’t banning exports vaccine it?  EU tried ban exports EU UK way round backtracked We’re vaccinating 2 million per day. Cases, deaths, hospitalizations trending down. Focus know, prepared, don’t panic hey. that's us! (130 countries) Dude disaster half million dead bodies stacked corner. personally know ICU nurse Chicago would take issue assertion mild annoyance things worst self-centered. People 20's 30's still carry heightened chance hospitalization death. significantly less people received priority vaccinations, matter?

The rest non sequitur... could use reasoning argue risk locked first place, locked healthcare workers received vaccine, whatever bullshit ""muh economy"" argument want make. *Your* alternative essentially creates new class haves have-nots realize collectively dumb idea move on. 

Either safe us all, stay together. ok quarantining Ebola patients? Well let tell COVID far contagious Ebola killed 500K Americans Ebola killed grand total one person US. support quarantining Ebola patients better support quarantining COVID patients also. course want time families. I'd certainly take extra years parents, much Trump-loving idiots. However can't go look young essential workers' faces tell I'd rather parents get years fine essential workers, literally keeping society running, getting long term significant health conditions leave disabled life. course death one many negative health outcomes, certainly want condemn small sliver essential workers lose 60+ years life, much larger sliver 60+ years life significantly reduced quality long term health conditions. yeah, want minimize QALYs lost, yeah means reducing long term health conditions, death.

And course nursing homes would still eventually get vaccines supply issues resolved. course take care everyone country, that's good society does. resources scarce, must prioritize. feel ya! 70 yr old dad gets second shot march 2nd. cannot happier. parents far people ive worried this. like anyone wants vaccine able get one July. personally think sooner. 600 million doses Pfizer Moderna end July. expect Johnson Johnson approved end month begin rollout next month. Johnson Johnson 100 million doses hand since one shot vaccine, believe general public able get vacinated pretty quickly. think April May open vaccine everyone. “Not nothing”


Interesting problem solving Bullshit. Pure refined bullshit. seriously advocating welding people homes? United States would uprising hands word got government anything like that. would cause many countless deaths. would increase IFR 0.4% 0.7% perfect, pretty good, right? opposed disaster that’s portrayed? Pretty much. course eye doctor pretty much told go catch Covid saw day. thought great everything opening young healthy people (of considered one) take advantage it. went say young healthy people catch Covid could reach herd immunity. thanks! betting vaccine instead. probably is. fiance's family millionares. fact NZ island fairly remote part world play role, island we'd still stringent land border measures place, like air water travel. recent cases put border guard back around Auckland make sure folks passing essential travel returning home.

Most kiwis confident leadership communicate clearly explain they're taking actions bang work needs done. needed land border would one. we're island, isn't. Definitely nothing..or lying South African variant unfortunately gotta least make effort click link. 494,000 excess deaths 485,000 actual confirmed deaths. might also explain number higher? sounds like fundamentally understand lockdown implemented. They're implemented hospitals go capacity prevent death rates increasing. Conspiracy theory lmao Yeah guess ICU full capacity multiple months now... Either lockdown zero effect getting lockdown seniors If, IF, vaccines *least* reduce severity transmissibility new variants, keep R0 value low end pandemic. 

Also, I've reading, vaccine provide better immunity actually getting virus. Correct I'm wrong, believe due way mRNA vaccines target virus. I've still got hope near end, prepared worst. 

Thankfully Moderna already working booster treated US FDA like flu shot. Quick approval without need long trials. Another ray hope. 13 Chinese variants. That’s insane. ^

When account people already formed immunity exposure outlandish say might low enough numbers shed masks sometime summer There's quite different levels overweight.

Could like Bezos saying net worth dollar.

Could LTC facility weight loss. Y'all avocado toast. want Gen Y. Says rolling rolling abbreviated believe Switzerland approved normal channels. And? mean manufacturing? US hand countries first? anything positive, unfortunately. Simplifying bit vaccines work showing immune system inactive, exceptionally weakened form whatever vaccinated immune system knows attack immediately sees again. already infected that's really going help anything since immune system already fighting infection. Paid US tax payers. amazing. Well said. Either way, social end pandemic coming. Yup, issue family. heard Massachusetts letting whoever brings someone 75+ get vaccinated also gets vaccinated regardless age/job/preexisting conditions. think that's genius idea everywhere. mean you’d probably go country’s subreddit you’ll see covid sticky, specify countries regions assume they’re vastly different. there’s degree truth person saying, someone lives “poor” country covid isn’t major issue. I'm merely saying decide worth weighing question let them.

Who saying this? nowhere close true unless lies daily vaccinations told. 

To date we've vaccinated people nearing 3m vaccinations per week. roughly 50m adults UK. Simple maths 50m-15m = 35m ... 35m/3m = roughly 12 weeks. even ramp more, hit 50m threshold 15 May. 

Maybe quote people get full vaccinations Autumn, I'm fully expecting jab 1 June bit miffed then. article pretty old speed things. Newer China admitted failure admitting failure.

In China, game politics decades been, ""The head sticks gets hit."" Nobody lower echelons admit anything, there's always lower echelon, way top. China never lifetimes free political society.

Can't fail something started using fullest third party production problems. also important note tech lobby vested interest pushing mask mandates post-widespread vaccination, since easier tech platforms like Zoom compete lower-bandwidth social interactions sterilized masked rather spontaneity serendipity maskless life. That’s problem. problem vast majority vaccines produced EU going **outside EU**. US, UK, China (!!!), bunch countries.

I wouldn’t surprised facility Marburg, Germany alone produced doses whole EU getting. Redditors dumb shit. read China title that's enough information them. dad try screw life long friend &amp; business partner Paul Allen Microsoft? buying stock ill cancer!!)? 
Is also conspiracy theory?

Or changed public image philanthropist right incident, Also conspiracy theory?

What vaccination experiments India South Africa? Also conspiracy?

How attempts force world use Internet Explorer, Also conspiracy?

Or dad invested Moderna already March 2019, also conspiracy?

Your dad dark business shark, there's nothing funny it. healthy 20 yr old sister got twice. Barely symptoms first time. Second time full symptoms. Even precautions still necessary get vulnerable vaccinated, non-SoCal West Coast going ""it's piece cloth""ing way miserable, sterile, dystopian bare life long time come, ""it can't hurt"" long technically allowing businesses operate full capacity, albeit dystopian mitigations. I'm seriously considering dropping highly prestigious philosophy PhD program move one back-to-normal-after-vaccine states rather come back whatever retrofitted version ""in-person"" decide shove people's throats. regulation partial monopolzation goverment real free market real competition. still goverment problem. 

Its like saying USA example private health care. not, USA market free, pay high taxes. vaccine rollout portrayed disaster. kind news get enough attention, should, happens start scheduling surgeries, exams.. Return normal life. sure point is. vaccines getting rolled out, slowly since less stock. 

Also remember European countries sticking 2-jab strategy vaccine makers suggest. countries would around 10% played fast loose like UK. disagree regards border. Though think UK apples apples comparison NZ. 

Try Ireland instead! Though far smaller island, still population similar New Zealand's(roughly 5 mil each). Ireland's main city, Dublin, 1.1 million people it, compared Auckland's 1.4 million. According wikipedia, population top 3 NZ cities 2 million(using 2018 census), Ireland's top 3 cities clock 1.5 million(using 2016 census). Sufficet say, New Zealand denser urban population despite bigger, multiple islands.

But think island main factor helped New Zealand. Rather, fact got slightly later countries, we're reasonably remote location, like mentioned. New Zealand getting first cases around time virus overloading hospitals Italy. gave us opportunity. easier us government squander that. 

And didn't. NZ looked data countries, applied could themselves, learned couldn't. able stamp COVID successfully, bought time resources strengthen border, testing, contact tracing capabilities countries using time resources instead treat honestly ghastly number COVID patients.

That's many kiwis talked confident government abilities.

Because resources government put place, hours 3 cases confirmed, top work school places cases, knew basically every place people visited contagious symptomatic, minute, publicly available. 

Today, finished genome sequencing positive cases, found UK variant, cross referenced cass currently MIQ facilities, could find match.

And continue try track cases came far they've spread order contain it, without making promises statements future lockdown decisions information need give us properly informed call.   criticising U.S., reply pointless. Maybe black death y'all making be. depends individual countries course, Norway example mass vaccination centers open 1-2 days week due slow deliveries. deliveries pick march (worst case scenario 3-4 times vaccines per month now) easily move vaccinating 7 days week increased hours. Smaller municipalities 50000 people confirmed capacity vaccinate 3000-4000 day really question getting enough doses. Yes, knew mindset already. Thanks posting Internet. proof vaccine numbers

Please remove sub speak best us, yet don’t live here. don’t want rich Americans. house prices already high New Zealanders afford - simply cannot extend wealth gap further. Cooking enough kill it. wash hands handling worried. Chinese propaganda account?

It's fairly obvious china desire hide numbers. still claim 4,636 people died. laughable. surprised EU gets everyone done Autumn, countries havent really started yet. Hopefully EU states setting infrastructure ready mass vaccination centres preparation getting vaccines through. Good, glad agree. video last April.

Since then, learned one Italian study saliva virus concentrations, one Austrian study likely infectious doses, one US NIH study survival real saliva.

The rest completely unrealistic absurd conclusions.

So apart studies, still clue transmission works.

If that's muster figure transmission, guess lockdowns well deserved. nothing know. Testing still limited authorities completely clear look for. missed many mild cases. Fucking childish mentality. Well, natural selection never hurt anybody true irrelevant. time machine? can't go back march 2020 Yeah, problem West let guard last summer opportunity control result virus got deeply society anything use.

On hand, contrary China, outbreaks West literally everywhere, concentrated region. Scientists worked currently approved vaccines: 😶👍 That's true. However also considered ""we know vaccines reduce transmission"" still message that's spread media large. experts sufficient amount data yet, that's fair enough thing say. interpret needing extra cautious forever. see right looking like vaccines reduce transmission rates, public large comes believe time (before next flu season), I'm sure politicians citizens would want push mask mandates hard. Maybe I'm giving people much benefit doubt. live area like know general sentiment folks are. definitely interesting see unfolds regardless. Right. strategy shut locally 3 days start cases prevent hospitals overwhelmed rather waiting cases high shut nationally weeks. saying ""lockdowns barely help cases high"" great argument New Zealand taking correct approach here. That’s good know. don’t Costco membership I’ll get ahold someone does.  think good handle actual mortality contrasting current reported covid excess mortality actual. Currently showing undercounts approx 1.6 times reported, add new  doubt, timetable likely imho. wouldn’t be. Shh people don’t like Trump US one infected many animals course 100000 years nice side effect causing cancer. Fragments still dna. point interview? sh*t control big Pharma new imperialists? n95s Good numbers right? FIL supposed get today. We’re also supposed get 12-15” snow he’s snow blowing every hour he’s ready American here, going completely fucked zombie apocalypse. Like way worse we’re getting fucked COVID, cause zombies. think bit misunderstanding. Kariko works Biontec, responsible mrna vaccine. thinking Moderna, president company admitted reading research paper inspired it. say impact gross understatement. might well today's Jonas Salk. Pretty sure Israel isnt occupying Finland dude. hope take wearing masks feeling well us future. pop mask feel mildy sick caugh sneeze there. help covid flu. WTF conspiracy theory ? EU (Like lot countries) bought lot differents vaccines various range provider time possible know one successfull. 

Some provider successfull, others not. Dang knew 80 people got it? TIL:  They've shut locally every time case pops up. disingenuous thing lying that. also start earlier countries (level 4: nationwide lockdown started 25th March) got lucky. Low population density easy close borders play part. 

What happened march 2020 determine policies 2021. Lockdowns might work keep cases low they're high barely help. Politicians tell ""it's people breaking rules!!"" nobody NZ. Continually overpromising underdelivering. Actual doctors Manaus reports people ground healthcare twitter elsewhere, saying yes they're seeing reinfection mostly asymptomatic much milder. However seeing plenty infections get covid first wave. Different sections city well. Also Iquitos, thing. helpful increasing production next year variants contagious? nice see someone 2 brain cells thread. interesting contrast counting asymptomatic cases publicly China officials. Yes, been. States advance knowledge vaccine amounts plan accordingly. huge logistical issues solved new administration, proof vaccine numbers China full denial mode virus even originated despite wuhan ground zero waaaay said ""Hi WHO, got deadly uncontrollable virus spreading wuhan. Kindly tell world careful"". previous administration put claim going 20 million doses end 2020. built ridiculous expectations get close rollout called failure. 

Don't build unreasonable expectations. get away calling 58 story building 68 story one business world, viruses believe hype. appear transmitted food.  article seems focus lot whether wave wave. issue infection expected variants, wave wave. variants ultimately result containing virus. wider spreads, chances variants. So, live one places restrictions lifting rightly wrongly, keep acting still danger. Help prevent new outbreaks. No, time frames viable virus. RNA detectable many weeks. hahahahahahaha People realize whole point lockdowns overrun hospitals. 

Once free reign, many people without enough hospitals shit spiral control people choose stay home fear. 

Not doomsdayist here, personally see us woods mostly coming summer. thoroughly entertained everyone going 'fuck we're going choose live normally matter happens' realizing there's logical reason trying flatten curve first place. Writes rubbish gets upset downvotes, sub. point virus becomes less less threat draws closer closer, unspoken assumption ""new normal"" default position grows cemented hope return old normal becomes fringe position. least certain West Coast cities. Almost everything said complete tosh, excelled silver became undesirable, China refused export opium. best thing could happen NZ would another one two years isolation. time, rich people went last year live normal life made arrangements nearly permanent. rich huge boost economy long run. becayse high risk means high levels south Africa variant.

In case makes little sense me. worry variants yet know much ones know about. countries much genome sequencing, idea what's happening within borders. Haha false claims. UK received still receives vaccines EU. pretend happen 

If I'm stating false claims. back claims make sure valid argument instead spreading nonsense. refusing vaccine poor countries get it? Even reefers skylights.

What UK food shortages import EU anymore using ourselves? Vaccines produced EU going UK due contracts one thing. it’s essential one thing. think EU citizens accept food exported experiencing shortages locally. 

How UK react that?

A worrying future ahead sure. light know today, EU done same, vaccine left USA, UK Israel European citizens vaccinated.

I get people got outraged EU set place export controls. Idk would necessarily call data weak, relatively small sample size. conclusive evidence, data give serious indication efficacy AZ SA variant much lower might simply work all. Again, conclusive saw little reason optimism. anyone believe China released Chinese made disease world. days ago mean Jan 11 that’s correct. EU giving second shot sooner ramping speed, EU deliveries Q2 year wouldn’t surprised EU finished giving second shot us distribution doesn’t bottleneck Imagine Pretty sad Alaska's News Source can't even spell Alaskans correctly. Interesting thing learnt. 500,000 teachers UK. could vaccinated one day...

Personally trust science interesting quickly could end arguement. No, surgery units, entering isolation room, usually wear otherwise. may different nations. mRNA based vaccines American owned

Pfizer/Biontech American owned. think explanation bad, difference small shouldnt yet rule statistical fluctuation. dont know confidence intervals really are, could difference isnt statistically significant.

It kinda show articles biontech giving 100% efficacy severe disease possibly bit premature. No, data. government's mode control involves level keeping people dark. Thanks fact checking that’s 1/1,000 population every day. second statistic user uses clearly US would suggest first supposed well, 300,000 nursing home deaths per day obviously, comically wrong. \*flu Secondary schools terrible. Primary schools pretty good. fits know covid transmissibility broader scale. EU approved mechanisms ban exports, far aware used yet.

That correct. healthcare workers wearing masks before? everything china done bad china sued damages, like american way sue sue could doctor assume something needed aspirin late 2020? teacher feel bit unfair. Fact secondary students proven significant vector transmission. Students advised wear face masks can't teach face mask daily basis room, maskless 6 hours day selection 800 students weekly basis. September January 32 students teach tested positive, I've lost track number teachers got it, I'd put around 25%. fully support vaccine roll public health perspective going work absolute hell, wife classed extremely vulnerable thankfully vaccinated everyone around getting sick really worrying teachers died profession excluding healthcare workers. job put position vulnerable apart police.

Again, Palestine never missing chance miss chance. Every Arab state interested helping either fully withdrawn partially withdrawn. mental block what's good real world. So, Palestine begs vaccine fly jet pick needs take every resident dinner year.  unethical part government, let's never miss chance miss chance. older generation die without injection will, might, will, save lives. 

Worse, Palestine act immediately, rapidly spreading UK variant carries virulence announced 50% (40-70) higher, means even citizens broader age range, like 40-45 100, become infected, suffer more, ratio infected continue die.

The world medical emergency. Palestine thinks way handle ignore financial reality, powerful hammer, beg, beg, beg. Ouch. see Arab world Islamic world except Iran wants total destruction Israel...a spiritual sister Palestine, faded, faded away.

If lived Palestine believed honest elections, would do? agree often see myth repeated us ‘worst country world deaths’. look per capita, you’re not. even top five.

The US badly, one’s denying problem US using vaccines manufactured bought, actually come  would point like know whether lockdowns good idea?

what months/years scientifically know fact lockdowns zero efficiency?

then never lockdowns again?

i think would amazing


ps: lockdowns placeholder type measure hospitals area shut covid wards right winter. prepared threw away. Yeah looks like US almost 5 million cases early-mid see study done using data states, great variety geographical location. 1912 samples December 13-16, 2019 2% samples containing COVID-19 antibodies. 5477 samples December 30, 2019 1.2% samples containing COVID-19 antibodies.

That's 1.4% samples.

US population 330,000,000 x 0.0014 = says takes 1-3 weeks develop antibodies. Let's use average 2 weeks.

Going data almost 5 million cases Covid 19 US early-mid December 2019. info? China gave information 92 patients across China symptoms typical Covid patient October November 2019. unable verify whether patients ever Covid. antibody tests administered individuals came back negative. shown typical antibody test previously infected Covid patient come back negative one year testing, yet slightest bit hesitant jump conclusion anyway. feeling wouldn’t reasonable jump conclusion unless least *some* evidence *some* known Covid cases December also came back negative Covid. would easy this. either never bothered this, found evidence inconsistent claiming. first vaccinations would border staff nurses Eh, public messaging build confidence go whole approval process. Good within Govt inside knowledge. Astra Zeneca vaccine, whose development funded uk taxpayers sold *at cost* (the vaccine true) vaccine sent India. It’s also vaccine used WHO’s Covax program, get vaccines world’s poorest people.

But yeah, UK nothing help anyone else. There’s plenty people Reddit locked years pandemic loving everyone miserable them. 

They can’t handle going back get VarIANts?!!??

And also probably write articles like “it’s month since 28 year old friend vaccinated. see masked outside 28ft distance? quite yet!!”  А я бы назвал. Thank India! Wonder don’t hear much countries supplying COVID vaccines rest world? Wonder who’s supplying Pfizer / AstraZeneca / Moderna rest world? data wasn’t really weak, high statistical significance bar data passed showing AZ 10% effective SA variant french wanted buy product instead buying biontech, already promising test results.

Not conspiracy theory there. fact it’s 66% effective SA strain might mean vaccinations done UK useless Long run. Meaning redone. UK export ban; funded helped set supply line country one vaccines. least nationalistic vaccines: UK licensed Oxford/AZ vaccine cost entire world provided funding COVAX entire EU.

The EU approved mechanisms ban exports, far aware used yet. Amen brother. ending, curled one right there. Surreal, think best word. 

We read it, strong interest viruses epidemics everything, scared me. (I said living near time, checked year actually was, moved away. back visit). 

I'd gone parents visit newcomers church arrived Hong Kong. must Easter weekend. remember worried gone Toronto, since close, concerned someone SARS getting bus. remember thinking family must safe let leave airport coming hot spot. nice, kid cute. 

Kid also spiked fever next day. 

And found no, really screening quarantining anyone coming Hong Kong airport (sound familiar?), Chinese family go quarantine put notice might too. 

Then major power outage, whole neighbourhood got together pass time. go church neighbourhood, none people exposed sick kid Hong Kong. remember questioning wisdom move potentially going quarantine, one. 

In end, sick kid regular cold, fine. way could known time. 

SARS scary--absolutely terrifying time. first time life we'd seen respiratory virus like that. spread incredibly fast, transmitted doorknobs fecal plumes, killed frequently well. Seeing local doctors wearing hazmat suits like I'd seen documentaries Ebola really help. 

You asked anything like now, no, terms restrictions, lock downs masks. surrealness beginning? Oh yes, much so. sense world sleepwalking danger crazy land trying prepare. think Canada would much better SARS experience, apparently went pants-on-head instead. seemed like beginning expressly *ignoring* word SARS--SARS scared people badly, suspected using ""covid"" people panic outright. still sure right answer. Also irony calling young people self centered many sacrificed year lives keep older generation alive gives fucks them

This discourse also going Europe still nonsensical. ""Young people"" sacrificed ""old people"" ""young people"" need vaccine first people world college students elderly? Middle aged people financial burdens families (but admittedly interest parties) get fucked? joined effort BioNtech Pfizer. US government financed zero dollars. government funding came Germany. Germany screwed building factories early enough signing stupid contracts.  totally fine. EU done same. Everything post almost seems like dimension traveler.

My ancestors family business ruined due opium, cringe really hard see people defending colonialism/imperialism hard.  Regarding mutations occuring:

Are less protected infection vaccines effective mutations?

I'm wondering since Covid last year I'm hoping protect better mutations keep mutating... will. I'm forced danger. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

We’re year they’re implementing policy. way complain state wasting vaccines. States control supply, state getting shot arms, fine job. I'd really like someone real knowledge situation acknowledge cases dropping, tell us why.

Also, new UK variant pretty much every country, world numbers still dropping. Better America worse many others, go r/australia see bad get  feel like I'm fool possible? 2% people severe disease without sypmtoms? half kilo hummus Pfizer took idea, developed it, trialed it, brought market. steps inconsequential. sick people wearing masks would explicitly said that. fact they're open new normal entails suggests much impalatable that; i.e. least year mask mandates healthy people. Already Biden let slip 100 days going 265 *more* days tacked afterward. capacity administer vaccines much higher we're currently doing. We're going able give vaccine basically fast get it.

My office vaccine 65s, ran supply day, we're now, primary care offices across country. local mass vaccination clinics handle thousands day running minimum capacity, due lack vaccines.

Basically production bottleneck vaccine distribution point. don’t think US issues, least regarding vaccine distribution. super fast US. six months, CDC recommending two tests travel. I'm sure ""new normal"" would prevent living many great things ""before"" though. good, existing indicator new normal would Japan's way dealing viruses : anyone sick wearing mask public places. Also high sanitary procedures public spaces. need Sinovac, Cansino, Gameleya on. need all.

Because World World. read unlikely yet still possible. fish meant eaten without cooking. Ну то есть пиздят. wonder (from political Party cannot name Mods) actually started wearing masks now. new leader seems sending better message previous leader, politicizing it, reminding people masks common sense work one thing help everyone else.

Crazy ideas new leader, know. Awsome, good every computere helps, well done. I'm sure ignoring advice. 

The say OK give 65s. Swedes say they'd OK give 65s to, given they've got access vaccines stronger evidence effectiveness 65s, they're using age group instead. ~~question~~ answer indicates know science virus. 

Again, sequences withholding? Pff. 

The final phase vaccine production bottling. Vaccine beer. 

This extreme important produce billions doses pro year. imagine, BioNTech followed Moderna produces vaccine self instead ask Pfizer provide ""bottling"" facility(I simplifying bit situation). Good decision Sweden. [""very soon"" said boris MHRA started review 2 weeks ago could see something week maybe? virus start China, early sequences point someplace else. point source particular virus. 

The world needs information China refuses hand WHO. Everyone able see knows. probably release information without purpose. everyone know can't anything information. well developed field, virology, wrote, experts either know know other. read others' scientific papers. would want point. Making sure im around aware risks. Imagine countries thinking like that...

Just short reminder. used vaccine invented US, Germany. Rec 4 ship it? REC 5 guesz, although REC 1 set apartment building.... maybe REC -  I'd argue, crowdsourced platform, aimed helping others growing exposure, appropriate sub 12k subscribers ;)

But guess decision made post shadow banned literally stepped outside months. Nice ad hominem attack though

...you step outside. less one per cent health board area (Lothian). That's 99% uptake everyone offered vaccine.

I understand lagging bit behind areas -takeup lower amongst ethnic minorities, examples. Edinburgh one whitest places Britain. anyone know ingredients look hand sanitizer makes lather like soap get sticky? I'm trying find one both. official ban, Matt Hancock forced Oxford team inexperienced vaccine manufacturing company, make sure UK get vaccines first. may actually backfired, AstraZeneca failed deliver promised numbers UK &amp; EU. string?

Your question indicates know science virus. 

Virus evolves, always. Read headlines, UK, South Africa, Brazil, California, plenty more. mean, evolve? virus series RNA sequences; living; matter replicates randomly, influenced pretty much random environment.  sequences carry markers history, like carry ancestors, many generations before, carried.

So, looking genetic sequences, everyone know lot you, scientifically.

This virus history. back time, one see virus matched time. So, duck eaten started this, virus show sequences duck. came top secret biochemical warfare lab, unusual sequences would present. 

Understanding caused transmission human critical understanding done, topics explored scientific experts worldwide. duck, whatever scientists dream create early warning info, like testing randomly ducks eaten, maybe. world virology allied fields. top secret lab, that's another issue. would explosive separate subject. virologists would look identify stop replication asap, blows up. 

Does help?  No, vaccinating enough people will. Mandating covid passport everyone vaccinated lead infighting.

I suppose would great ending pandemic US, forcing everyone customer facing job fight get vaccinated asap keep job teenagers want vaccine party Karen needs vaccine first get haircut. think Bill Gates daughter would wear CZ glass ring?  masks go away NYS? Yes, people think. Without serious education efforts, people aware what's around them.

I best stay touch reality, know several teammates pandemic weird year. want know one vegetable Fauci says must avoid. difference last admin one night day terms vaccine. previous one [passed purchase vaccine, [outside nursing homes lacked distribution fell [17 million short set vaccinated 20 million people end 2020, [CDC could tell us much vaccine actually going early days new administration. steaming pile crap could addressed much better federal side things.

Barring winter storm that's going hit lot country coming days/week, numbers vaccines administered daily continue climb, especially J&amp;J's vaccine approval suspected soon.

It's stark contrast month ago. real significant barrier remains US done COVID awful past year companies able make enough vaccine. ""Они"" кто? Минздрав? Потому что в статистику включают точные числа, а 80%, 90% это оценочное (нельзя просто помножить количество смертей на этот процент и сказать, что это все COVID). 94% drop symptomatic infections also mean individuals longer spread virus others? data show individuals develop symptoms potentially still spread virus non-vaccinated individuals? know UK vaccine export ban. 

That seems mighty hypocritical US giving much $600 week extra unemployment pandemic.

Which another untargeted, blunt instrument used insufficient existing unemployment support infrastructure. cases, $600/wk enough cover expenses, others even come close paying bills, live high CoL area.

Most developed countries unemployment system that, least initially, pays percentage recent income. way, suddenly get laid off, immediately make drastic changes life time find new That's aside point though, hardly country given direct stimulus payments.

And point countries done direct stimulus payments necessary better ways manage impact pandemic. Case point, I've able work home well paying job. going vacation restaurants caused save money 2020 2019. direct stimulus payment would've gone straight savings account would've helped nothing. that's actually happened. wife accidental American (born US non-US parents, left 1 yr old, still US citizen), actually got $1200 check (and get $600 one, cross-Atlantic mail takes time). helped one.

Zoonotic viral recombination happen different strains virus infect host.

The recombination event results significant change genome virus, unpredictable results. One possibility new virus retain ability infect host animal (eg humans) cause severe immune response due parts viral proteins meant animal (eg mink).

Viral recombinations like got H1N1 pandemic (swine flu, pigs), H5N1 pandemic (bird flu, avians) many outbreaks deadly infectious diseases.

Even worse, Viral recombination events betacoronaviruses occur mostly spike protein, target vaccines, also major factor virus’ severity.

If mink-version virus infects human human-version, viral recombination event occurs shuffles genome, may see new strain increased severity existing vaccines work against.

So saying ignore rules make pandemic worse, get vaccinated sooner?

_Goes whirlwind tour Spain Italy_ explained many times. EU said back summer 2020 would expect doses produced EU fulfil EU contracts first would outrage. UK USA allowed manufacturers set supply chains meet contracts (such AZ factories UK EU).

However EU talk implementing late game would screw everyone else involved. What’s worse reason EU even bad situation it’s delays try get best deal possible (e.g AZ 3-4 months get factory set EU operating full capacity). spent long haggling price EU factories would probably operating capacity start year like UK ones dealt teething problems Q4 2020. That's article saying. fact, every single country initial outbreak pushed pushed earlier months. know Italy November 2019 latest. cover months well since know late simulations meant simulate real world. Cases started dropping US significant vaccination happened. wave burning naturally every previous wave done; vaccine making happen bit faster. That’s virus works bud Move west coast. They’ve truly lost mind covid, anywhere else country. Let sun shine in. Interesting. announced human human transmission January 14th 2020. Many claimed controlled China therefore China informed world January 14th human human transmission. that, released genome less weeks. also informed w show mysterious new virus outbreak end December, days outbreak first identified. Also, I'm curious know countries restricted international travel found cases seem think China exceptional that. Actually countries success without brutality China.

Yes warnings avoid small, enclosed spaces much possible. Elevators also poor ventilation generally rely fan blow air around space. perfect condition spread virus. Stay away saying China throw blame truly lies, CCP. really hope wrong, see coming from.
I hope UK remains close EU (I wanted us stay EU).

The EU immune shift right, happening several parts continent.

As future bleak hopeful. think low point relationship post Brexit sooner rather later learn work together partners. mean, 2 countries started vaccinations yet NZ Aus, instead handling virus vaccines go normal thorough drug approval process doses prioritised countries can't afford wait, like US It’s likely Boris Johnson made number overly optimistic predictions progress dealing Covid set targets government hasn’t able meet. seems learnt lesson this. think time government downplaying expectations hoping everyone impressed exceed targets.  literally true everywhere earth.

There's third coming up, EU EU.

This mean EU cares sign decent contract, though. Plus taking little extra time Australia chance countries provide larger scale data allow vaccine companies prioritise doses needed. , generally every teacher teach online **and person** students

Not true all. mean government incompetent lay conspiracy theories. They're shit. lie possibly need booster shots. UK much way domestic vaccine production facilities government threw whole bunch money *making domestic vaccine production facilities*. Sensible get jabs quick Winter threatens, sure long take though! Agreed - general public would go stores masks required half vaccines uk BioNtech. US even attempted something like that, we'd multiple January sixth situations across country. case they'd right. solution draconian never okay. ways curb without that, ask Australia New Zealand. British government led Covid 19 run rampant country sell half-baked half-tested vaccine, half board MHRA consists AstraZeneca shareholders.

Let sink in. 2 cases many million?

95% 100%.

Nothing see folks. really does.  Melbourne patient use nebuliser hotel quarantine actually aerosolise virus.  Infected 2 hotel quarantine workers 2 guests rooms floor.

So there’s definitely important practical difference.

If true aerosol, hotel quarantine wouldn’t work (not without negative pressure rooms).  Contact tracing wouldn’t work anywhere near well does. it’d constantly spread apartment/office buildings like wildfire (rather occasional location-related outbreak).

There’s hard line droplet aerosol, it’s continuum.  covid clearly droplet end range. days, declared December end, virus much control, population less. China declared mid June world chaos. kind population, trust information. guess people dumb enough trust that. mind. bad flu season could’ve winter 2019? 10 trips Yes, AstraZeneca took idea Oxford brought market. _that_ one ""the UK vaccine"".

I think everyone talking masks must living states without real restrictions, cause it’s big deal am. Bars restaurants close 10, nearby places reopened indoor dining months, etc.

Err, no. F2F teachers. That’s point. may well avoidable remote learning, we’ll never know. I’d rather stake life coworker’s life wager. think what's confusing folks lot complicated test question transmission test symptomatic disease vaccine trials.

If want test whether people get sick, get pay attention symptoms, report feel ill, come treatment, etc. count got sick placebo vaccine groups voila, done. That's clinical trials did, basically.

But test whether people less contagious, figure whether they're getting people sick. that?

Well, one thing measure viral load, lot studies actually **assuming** lower viral loads means less contagiousness. reasonable assumption, nearly direct measure headlines like ""Vaccine reduces spread risk"" might suggest. twitter thread pointed also makes assumption jumps: string together measure viral load reduction, combine estimate contagiousness function viral load.

They'll also test whether people getting sick asymptomatically, good test reasonable alternative hypothesis (that vaccine making people asymptomatic still capable spreading). much closer real test transmission risk view, still quite ideal tell directly vaccinated asymptomatic carriers lower probability passing others would without vaccine.

**So TL;DR people understand estimating transmission effects vaccines going require lots pieces indirect evidence** might harder general public understand. much closer proper ""scientific theory"" sense built upon many interlocking pieces, whereas efficacy vaccines stopping disease much empirically straightforward question (""What percentage people got it?""). comments news. real. it’s simple. Pfizer relatively difficult vaccine administer storage timing requirements. addition -70C storage temperature, time limits soon must administered thawed drawn up.

Of course, trials trial sites followed storage handling instructions flawlessly. real world mass-vaccination program, things happen.

So it’s reassuring see real-world numbers within 1% published efficacy trial. *very* smart! Unavoidable. Even remote-”learning”. robust alternative pharma logistical system within country probably get involved. Well crap. Would nice warning week ago. I've steady dose ibuprofen acetaminophen several days due inflamed disk. Got second vaccine dose recently well medicated.

Had problems aches fever vaccine, makes sense. Hope I'm screwed this. meant new normal they'd spell describing sounds reasonable term ""new normal"" actually suggests. fact they're explicitly saying might ""new normal"" suggests something sneakier depressing going on. Fine, want call sharing, let's make ""commercial arrangement"" Canada countries let vaccines produced US protect vulnerable! endless lockdowns demanded Reddit

I see spent pandemic time building straw men? really feels like manufacturing enemy head feel helpless virus want something tangible crosshairs. want over. whole point article letting companies honor contracts planned, much ado nothing really. EU controlling exported territory prerogative. playing fair humanely possible ensuring get shafted process. Exactly. work military animals example, get ton shots. That's ""new normal"". That's regular normal. Mask policy, herd immunity threshold, flip flop school reopenings, there’s probably I’ve stopped listening him.

It’s much even care done that; it’s doesn’t acknowledge previous decisions. mask one worst. Even official story basically “I lied strategic” Woooo!!!

Let's THIS! Kn95 pretty expensive replace everyday. Go away, Trump. Even kids school alot still neglected, still abused home, system still anything it, bullied usually victim trouble, full isolation, people still get together, kids still playdates. mean worst thing I'm physically seeing much paper work give kindergarten aged child. think problem lies deeper remote stuff. enjoy involved teaching kids. people would hone school. kids isolated whole time nothing do. cope mental stress homeschooling. people complain also half people hold parties get inebriated friends funny kids. What's damaging? Curious pick Gladys premier state accounts 80-90% cases deaths? greedy landlord

Assumption. deal extraordinary hardship sick woman paying rent couple months

More like year, probably lot one Go sell property first time homeowner

Can't pay bills? Sell stuff. Would offer advice lady can't pay rent? doubt concern trolling seriously.

Person brings realistic problem today's world call trolling. Nice.

Garbage post. primarily using AZ complete vaccination everyone even might enough. million dollars mean took money. Eh, I'm landlord, I'm glad exist. There's nothing inherently parasitic relationship. building want rent out, want able rent apartment.

Not sure think alternative is. could live world without landlords, would mean either multiunit rental housing shitty government housing nobody wants live in. eyesore. impede children's learning recognize faces. 

There plenty cultures people keep faces covered times (such Middle Eastern countries countries high levels pollution), whole lives, children problems recognizing faces. Working children pandemic, I've actually impressed smile mask 7month old baby, she'll smile right back me. long kids still seeing faces parents, grandparents, etc, they're still getting plenty exposure recognizing faces. They're huge environmental issue given people wearing disposable ones.

Walk around literally anywhere besides hospital. came Target. Literally 90% people wearing cloth masks. surprised actually using *fewer* masks hospital. rounded time last year, would go 10 masks morning. Now, get one whole day. effectiveness, zero, probably lot less advertised. 

The ""advertisements"" rigorous, peer reviewed scientific studies, I'm sure said change minds people believing this. viral clinic, diagnose dozens COVID patients one week, single person got infected March now. we've wearing face shields N95s. Initially, even N95s, wearing goggles/face shields cloth masks. cause needless divisiveness serve tribal totem medical precaution.

They're divisive distrust data saying *work.* clearly medical precaution, wearing 100% time hospital. cause ""needless divisiveness"" ""tribal totem"" denialist chooses ignore dozens studies support efficacy. mask *mandates* work? That's nuanced question, people still gathering privately wearing masks, leading spread virus. Instagram account, looking stories show good picture 5 minutes. people *do* wear masks, work. misrepresentation. Fauci trying stave mask shortages back March 2020 demand hospitals exploding, rightfully said give people protection think does.

He since also clarified people wearing ton fear mongering sub. Vaccine required many jobs, schools, travel pandemic new conspiracy. 12% US 1 dose, 4.4% two. So, clear, course *an* impact, that's true since first shot, can't reason cases halved month. Additionally, look Israel, far ahead us vaccinations, they're seeing modest drop, less ours, fair say take really make mark. *Due restrictions* Gotcha, made wrong assumption media want lose thing keeping alive. dont see harder uncontrolled border. put police borders road. borders Australia hundreds roads, tough deal it. Entire countries underwent lockdowns, everyone stopped traveling, economy put pause, people affected places wear masks.

So clearly, overall, people ***do*** care. Even small, vocal minority not.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, could avoid next time nasty virus pops up, nip bud kills thousands (let alone per day), would better.

That's good is. effective vaccine? committed Astrazeneca looks like getting approved national authority TGA. logistics modelled record 2020 flu vaccination going mainly pharmacies doctors like mRNA ones. think stay closed vaccination completed. wear whole box masks want 


You cannot mandate anyone else wear them
After Covid definitely relate wanting wear mask. can't stand wearing pants public.  think us Canadians feel? wanting wear mask one thing. wanting people wear another. 

If people choose wear mask longer required business. 

The mask counterjerk little nutty sometimes. coming, every day step closer, matter pessimists might say. Keep head won't. Croatian politicians care citizens much care maintaining good relationship rest EU.  see point vaccine certificate proof immunity; especially people 1st dose early there's guarantee long effective for. would need requirement either antibody test and/or booster shot X amount weeks prior travelling. Like martial laws. /s That's weird attack considering model better job anyone else, professional amateur.  Yes, problem that, indeed. problem people would want wear after, would force viewpoints others want get rid masks afterwards (which unfortunately might plenty) NZ locked knew varient was. rightly assumed UK SA could risk waiting reason locked unknown origin source.

By way, I'm saying landlords evil anything like that. I'm simply saying manage exist dent fact housing artificially constrained.

Incidentally, true United States, worldwide obviously figure speech. Maybe said ‘indefinitely’ didn’t think anyone would pedantic enough assume meant ‘literally forever’. required law.

The whole, ""But mah freedom!"" falls apart even superficial inspections. live land laws. Slow news day huh Priorities guess. They’re insincere going lot others feel way That's point. intended generalize huge number most. think it’s 50% effective SA variant, currently concerning variant there. believe it’s higher efficacy UK variant. Africa needs anywhere

That's frustration we're presently facing. (Aside lack resources afford nationwide vaccinations.)

The rest world worried ""South African variant"" nobody worried South Africa. 0. lecture whomever want. internet dude.

ahahaha , got deleted fair fauci quoting British scientists fantastic chance. evidence deadly slim. PM announced deadly lot scientists surprised announced results preliminary. absurd. last paragraph contradicts itself. US would Moderna vaccines, would probably pushed JNJ bit faster.

I guess fail see would bad. Fauci charge, no.... won’t hell EU allowing that's messed imo EU countries like Belgium higher death per capita USA, criminal people still listen Fauci, yeah would like add reason Canada struggling right US allowing vaccines made US go elsewhere  don’t claim know works article seems imply English professors humanities draw salary university (which know true) medical ones don’t (which true news me). talk like EU management - private endeavor private company, stated contract vaccines EU would produced.

People talk like EU UK government body that's handling this. No. AstraZeneca plants.

The difference AstraZeneca said 2 plants UK would producing EU, reality UK allow vaccines go UK.

AstraZeneca access information, yet disclose EU, ""best effort"" taking one contract side breach other.  small sample size. See comment Wow I'm sorry happened. believe vaccines need two three weeks time effective. dad got second shot Thursday fully vaccinated two weeks dose still get sick needs take precautions 
I wish best parents recovery data pretty weak. tested young people, showed little ability prevent serious death death. showed effective preventing mild disease, isn’t care about. recommended used even ZA variant Oh god, believe?

How many people need vaccinated? hospitals need be? low deaths need be? go back normal?

These questions able least start answered still aren't. think would agree that, countries taking care theirselves first naturally they’re going do. think US state effective way close border. many roads many people cross state lines daily.

I drove near NYC 9/11 effectively controlled access lower Manhattan island roads. blocking Texas something would impossible. Thanks, can’t unsee that. Lol never going end, it? Previous infection appears offer strong protection reinfection, even variants. true vaccines (with possible exception Astrazeneca South Africa variant).  summer Australia now. sumemr Europe, life back normal Europe, too. they've proven resistant variants

Isn't mostly luck? part virus picked expose antibodies, whether mutations affected part.

As understand it, everyone picked portions spike, grounds spike mutates virus ought become less effective. approach worked degree. AZ seem affective UK variant, example. **The Judgement Day** Avoid anything aloe, anything really besides alcohol, water, stabilizers. moisturizer anything like that. vaccines infection 30% US level immunity now, low end

Definitely low end. CDC estimated 30% population end November. Also, 30% essential susceptible portion population unreasonable think lot people getting mild asymptomatic.

Fauci talked recently 70% herd immunity, virus outbreaks general, hit inflection point around 30% virus can't really spread logarithmically anymore, thus R value plummeting 1 now. addition, speculation regards covid specifically, viruses tend evolve become less deadly contagious time, adaptation survival. Israel forcibly vaccinating Palestinians wishes PA. They’re government vaccines. Well appear collective attitude flu. vaccine mandatory, people encouraged take half people do. also effective, 39% last year 29% year (in US). Deaths flu heavily skewed towards old health conditions like Covid. flu vaccine, natural immunity, treatments, lived level illness death many years restrictions imposed society. second EU official said exports since end January concerned vaccines produced Pfizer Inc BioNTech Moderna Inc. 

This seems important. implies export mechanism set AZ also exporting, stopped. see problem allowing Pfizer Moderna export long fulfilling contract. anyone still think US vaccine issues?

Oh didn’t realize engaged kicker, given China far open data virus, literally everything say virus degree suspect. idea actual infection rate was, many people died virus. 

As US, reason, virus became political early on, meant entire response clocked think layer American political nonsense. again, right Americans everything showing signs slowing time soon, basic facts like sheer amount unhealthy people poor provision healthcare go undiscussed.  fact apply statement anywhere US last 60 years speaks volumes. Almost one dying? planet live on? really hope said done, America engage proper national mourning.

Welp. descriptive statistics also hypothesis testing check difference significant? American already survived countriess' strain COVID, protected variants like seasonal flu, one catch different year (but different cycle/permutation, case)? article you.

By Carl Zimmer Feb. 14, 2021 Updated 1:45 p.m. ET Americans anxiously watch variants first identified United Kingdom South Africa spread United States, scientists finding number new variants originated here. concerning, many variants seem evolving direction — potentially becoming contagious threats own.

In study posted Sunday, team researchers reported seven growing lineages novel coronavirus, spotted states across country. evolved mutation genetic letter.

“There’s clearly something going mutation,” said Jeremy Kamil, virologist Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport co-author new study.

It’s unclear whether makes variants contagious. mutation appears gene influences virus enters human cells, scientists highly suspicious.

“I think there’s clear signature evolutionary benefit,” Dr. Kamil said.

The history life full examples so-called convergent evolution, different lineages follow path. Birds gained wings evolved feathered dinosaurs, example, bats evolved furry, shrew-like mammals. cases, natural selection gave rise pair flat surfaces could flapped generate lift — enabling bats birds alike take sky fill ecological niche animals could not.

Charles Darwin first recognized convergent evolution studying living animals. recent years, virologists found viruses evolve convergently, too. H.I.V., example, arose several species viruses shifted monkeys apes humans. Many lineages H.I.V. gained mutations adapted species.

As coronavirus branches new variants, researchers observing Darwin’s theory evolution action, day day out.

Dr. Kamil stumbled across new variants sequencing samples coronavirus tests Louisiana. end January, observed unfamiliar mutation number samples.

The mutation altered proteins stud surface coronavirus. Known spike proteins, folded chains 1,200 molecular building blocks called amino acids. Dr. Kamil’s viruses shared mutation changed 677th amino acid.

Investigating mutant viruses, Dr. Kamil realized belonged lineage. earliest virus lineage dated back Dec. 1. later weeks, grew common.

On evening discovery, Dr. Kamil uploaded genomes viruses online database used scientists across world. next morning, got email Daryl Domman University New Mexico. colleagues found variant state, 677 mutation. samples dated back October.

The scientists wondered whether lineage discovered one 677 mutation. Probing database, Dr. Kamil colleagues found six lineages independently gained mutation own.

It’s difficult answer even basic questions prevalence seven lineages United States sequences genomes less 1 percent coronavirus test samples. researchers found samples lineages scattered across much country. can’t tell mutations first arose.

“I’d quite hesitant give origin location lineages moment,” said Emma Hodcroft, epidemiologist University Bern co-author new study.

It’s also hard say whether increase variants actually result contagious. might become common simply travel holiday season. might exploded superspreader events bars factories.

Still, scientists worried mutation could plausibly affect easily virus gets human cells.

An infection begins coronavirus uses tip spike protein latch onto surface human cell. unleashes harpoon-like arms spike’s base, pulling cell delivering genes.

Before virus carry invasion, however, spike protein bump human protein surface cell. contact, spike becomes free twist, exposing harpoon tips.

The 677 mutation alters spike protein next spot proteins nick virus, conceivably making easier spike activated.

Jason McLellan, structural biologist University Texas Austin involved study, called “an important advance.” cautioned way coronavirus unleashed harpoons still fairly mysterious.

“It’s tough know substitutions doing,” said. “It really needs followed additional experimental data.”

Dr. Kamil colleagues starting experiments, hoping see whether mutation indeed make difference infections. experiments bear suspicions, 677 mutation join small, dangerous club.

Convergent evolution transformed spots spike protein well. 501st amino acid mutated number lineages, example, including contagious variants first observed United Kingdom South Africa. Experiments revealed 501 mutation alters tip spike. change allows virus latch onto cells tightly, infect effectively.

Scientists anticipate coronaviruses converge mutations give advantage — viruses also immune system. Vaughn Cooper, evolutionary biologist University Pittsburgh co-author new study, said lab experiments alone wouldn’t able reveal extent threat.

To really understand mutations doing, said, scientists need analyze much bigger sampling coronaviruses gathered across country. right now, look relatively meager number genomes collected patchwork state university labs.

“It’s ridiculous country coming national strategy surveillance,” Dr. Cooper said.

Correction: Feb. 14, 2021 earlier version article misstated name scientist. Daryl Domman, Darrell Dinwiddie. Anyone Texas know best time check HEB website? Trying get appointment 77 year old uncle. 

I’m frustrated 49 year old cousin (also Texas) managed somehow con way getting vaccine. shouldn’t mad, shots arms good, wish easy uncle. totally true. strange sounds south Jersey teachers able vaccinated.  live north Jersey can't get vaccinated sister south Jersey first dose. Fucking hell. UK USA got vaccines EU? fuckers productions even exporting ZERO vaccines. actual fuck?! Don’t worry. won’t happen, still dozen bubbas everywhere go harassing voluntarily wearing mask I’m sick flu season appreciate CT giving vaccine older populations first, incredibly frustrating hear people age received state priority position (they've working home administrative position health care since March).

I'm personally working in-person one day week I'm saying I'm priority either, know many teachers need this. I'm anticipating restrictions slowly change ""advisories"" bit they're totally dropped. Fingers crossed process start happening soon cases telemetry well summer dip end Feb. J&amp;J comes line, that's game. Curious though - law prevents shipping unapproved vaccines? feel like could go ahead ship J&amp;J vaccines place ready injection day approved. guess would security risk whatever reason deem unsafe/ineffective... You’re wrong - think they’re addressing Indian government going way this. Building international goodwill smart move part could pay 10x later on. 

Ya need friends come up. So, UK USA restricts exports. one gives shit. EU would everyone would lose mind. standard schedule shorter one used original trial. like wearing mask, much less sacrifice people work unable see loved ones, wear masks longer ease restrictions sooner, would good trade off.  He’s legend Though think way person conveyed message comes dick-ish; really landlords hurting bad people lost jobs. Especially number 1 source income property that’s affected covid. 
I think American government really problem. Landlords renters shouldn’t worry losing everything unimaginable circumstances like pandemic happens. Especially since, like someone stated above, government bail outs huge companies indeed thing spend trillions military every year dumb article. Teachers Phase 1c rollout part groups vaccinated yet Missouri's vaccine rollout dogshit. writing garbage like keeping teachers safe easy – consistent. Across US availability vaccines teachers workers American schools become something lottery, available areas, many others even public schools reopened. 

is terrible supposed available *any* areas yet, still vaccinating high risk medical populations. tells writer 0 prior research writing this, simply care. Poor credibility. whole article used incite fear generate clicks. Ignore move on. positivity rate depends heavily entirely type quantity testing done, testing place. places required, places not, sometimes targeted population, sometimes self-selected, higher lower different times holidays, etc. completely useless metric. ultimately hoping countries default China may take control critical infrastructure like seaports, airports, power plants, military bases, furthering goal projecting power. go again... trained seals clap hero premier 'beat' Covid. Croatia didn’t buy Pfizer/Moderna/AstraZeneca? Croatia Hungary approve russian chinese vaccines emergency mechanisms, bypassing EU? EMA never, least, timely enough, approve those. every version story hear there's another one teacher reports they're getting pay work 10 hours week. Given teachers acting I'd say enjoying limited work pay. expected deliveries extremely limited, perhaps less 15 million Q2. sure great vaccine, much better nothing. Serum Institute promised billion doses end 2021, 200 million would go Oxford agreed license vaccine Serum Institute pledge would deliver world’s poorest people cost. Serum recently applied World Health Organization certification, would allow start exporting doses sold Covax, international health group negotiated vaccine purchases less wealthy countries, soon end January. Institute promised Covax 200 million doses.

So think distribution major issue. scale production massive. India administers humanity-scale polio vaccination drives every year. talking using similar model covid immensity Indian campaign hard grasp. 700,000 vaccination booths every campaign led 2.5 million vaccinators, 2 million vaccine carrier bags, kept cool 6.3 million ice packs. one national polio round, 200 million homes visited 170 million children think one reason vaccine diplomacy, another reason less interest among Indians taking vaccine. still causing hospitalizations people aren’t immune. wouldn’t give flying fuck herd immunity everyone actually going get vaccine. cares antibodies? 

T cells bro. response robust. Read it. soon vaccination one take medications map looked it.

Most experts gave vague ""after vaccination"". Surely mean 1 minute injection? Otherwise, much difference would make compared someone taking painkiller one minute injection? read someone mentioning 30 minutes longer after. get another vague recommendation - ""days"". know anymore.

After first dose, took Tylenol 28 hours injection arm sore became unbearable. plan hold painkillers long bear still see precise information it.  make sense. moratoria stating people can't evicted non-payment rent. way get evicted payment issues pandemic (so March) evicted reasons non-payment rent (criminal activity, example). 


The articles talking situation pretty thin details. actually kicked improperly, could sue get considerable amount. 


Just example, state, landlord even mentions right back balances could sent collections even *talks* eviction due non-payment rent **future** moratoria lapse, tenant get 3 months rent landlord plus damages legal fees. Governments local national required vaccinations immunizations schools, travel certain jobs long, long time... sure people think never happened before. uh, all? asking previous poster qualify poorer countries get first, that's all. see particularly care address part, use excuse talk bad US? typical response.... Cringe RemindMe! 30 days Plummeting case hospitalization numbers ramping vaccinations helps sentiment change too. Covid reactions spurs constant thing, situations ebb flow. study seem show effects COVID, small study.

Also, article directly says ""There increasing evidence restrictive measures aimed curbing pandemic significantly impacting childrens' mental health, researchers acknowledge."". Even admit lot harm children mentally, who've virus. even evidence superspreader events? feel like everytime Twitter claims there’s gonna one data never adds single event spiking cases. seems fearmongering buzzword me. France help Americans proved could win own. noble Capets held power France many years. government helped America longer exists several times over. They're eyesore. impede children's learning recognize faces. They're huge environmental issue given people wearing disposable ones.

 effectiveness, zero, probably lot less advertised. cause needless divisiveness serve tribal totem medical precaution. I've read bunch numbers. weeks ago said 2 million doses already ready go, later said 5 million. think manufacturing waiting approval. heard 100 million doses ready different time frames... heard ""by spring"" (whatever means), ""by April"" (1st 30th?), also ""by June"" (pretty different).

It would surprise see something like 5 million doses front 0.5-1.0 million per day ramping months. would fantastic news. Remember vaccine requires one shot easy distribute. One reason got academics. I've done work work essentially worthless publication. journal publish negative results that's nice. ends happening idea, work, keep info self put desk. Five years later someone else idea waste time discovering work.

The publish parish mentality awful. Yeah people expecting vaccine requires -70C br distributed countries without reliable power supply much. Lmao. Regular LA/Killed vaccines best bet mass vaccinations countries Yes young favored elderly. young future, progressive politicians charitable young people want return favors society, elderly lobby favor corporations wealthy elite. It’s sickening it’s time set priorities straight. Despite cases slowly coming back double digits, still worry regarding new UK strain recently detected Croatia. 200,000 vaccine doses said administered end February Russian Chinese vaccines becoming likely rolled out. Nocommasweb.site time ! dip.

People dropping mandates “opening up” already.

This going much worse been. That’s true.   US irrelevant. stated distraction, point. Stay focused. China bad guy. understand game bureaucracy there, wherever are?  Ask Chinese younger friends explain ""The nail stands gets hit."" Shea stadium allowed fans come May, problem selling every Mets game season. Quit fueling guy, it’s post history China; probably loves China. Ahahaha shit cracking efficacy definitely reduced, compared normal strain (and maybe uk variant?) something better nothing, especially able acquire vaccine types useful timeframe. agree masks. agree stop selfish. really evidence wearing masks harm kids, able show it. Except numbers looking promising Antibodies. Yeah, better! got caught pants last 100 years! Yep would nice able distinguish worry, speculation, facts. Well yeah ones trying implement right now. I’ll months gets implemented people beginning say nonsensical things like ""if there's even chance"" passing along infection wear mask. worth time. Go back South Dakota. "" Canada's Assaulted Men's Helpline"" leads recording bunch women laughing vociferously. studies emerging say vaccinated cuts significantly transmission.


[Vaccine reduces spread risk even 2nd shot, Israeli study showing Oxford vaccine slows virus spread Moderna vaccine blocks (87-93%) infections &amp; 91% (89-94%) France reason US citizens king. So? Riveting retort. Not. proper response, evidence, resort name calling laughing. Disagree. countries aware novel virus started spread thing China fully aware intentionally lying/covering prevent PR problem.

Many countries grossly incompetent handling , especially US Trump Admin. again, blatant lying starting. probably STILL lying. seem fail understand scientific method research work, information gathered, advice approach changes. Also, alot bad advice stupid politics coming White House. Everyone spent last 6 months praising though. real 2 week lockdown like France would zero cases today. There's giant difference needed international travel needed everyday life.

And yes, many people called latter all, think good thing people all.  Genuine question. people know whether they’re getting covaxin covisheild? understanding far could get either can’t choose? (Barring Chattisgarh guess) Less effective relatively according preliminary data, I’ve read someone’s comment SA resuming Vaccination vaccine Lol. clear lot people really thought hard vaccinations before. Immunizations required schools certain international travel jobs, many years. people accepted normal. proposed Covid many worried thing. No. export ban aka binding contract. 

Canada paid lot early. Disaster. 

US later EU paid comparable price. Full success. Production capacity expected increasing going forward. US 600 million mRNA doses July would 100 million currently eligible population won’t take vaccine. doesn’t factor J&amp;J. think there's going Super Bowl Valentine's wave.
 
You can't get infected already got infected Halloween Thanksgiving Christmas New Years parties. ""experts musing"" major problem whole pandemic

Yes, suggest drink bleach.  mean 'minimally significantly'? really that, think hatred towards late guidance telling people fully vaccinated still wear masks, quarantine, that. one who’s normal denying work, we’ve come far remarkable amount time get vaccine, several, told life pretty much same. 

I think vaccines administered get risk people vaccinated reach threshold “anyone wants get it” time conversation had. But, I’m fully vaccinated peers too, cookout zero masks zero social distancing. Everything I’ve read talks implementing future kind eliminates concern mentioned. countries talking vaccines readily available? Crazy -13. wearing mask selfish. like drunk driving. They'll immune enough get it. survive. think data available, areas offered vaccines 65+ health care ""essential"" workers (the definition varies). think they're tracking doses group. guess.

There 50 million people 65+ country 18 million health care workers. sure many people work grocery, first responder, roles, also younger people certain health conditions allowed too. guess I'd say 60-70% people vaccinated 65+ that's complete guess. China engaged academically intense exercise find source. blocking info? Passivity whatever political structural reason unhelpful. information got identified every time one sick showed hospital. China 21st Century. local hut medicine. pathology lab, least US, collects analyzes samples. China's. would absurd say town what, 50 million, first rate medical technology routines?

And that's irrespective China's prior idea wet markets fun historical, esoteric delicious. China gambled lost. cares. question samples. China answer ""What samples?"" China needs fire retrain virology leadership. 

Showing China is, acting first step.  can't suppress virological truth. know game get them. know unwilling ""get real"". 

No rational scientist throws hands says, ""We're done looking we're more."" attitude seems like masked fear Achilles heel. 

Something happened virus started replicating humans, China claims idea was. perfectly ok China dark inception. stupid. reason be, that's intellectually defensible nowhere else look? ignorance fear inception, nail getting hit. that's gone. 

There another virological event leading epidemic gone wild, that's real world. China well people huge price. that's point, either. exercise use unique time find case #1, 2, apparently thinks value discovery.

Everyone wants info table. hand, China's science framed Party rules. Look experts, general statements top. Listen searched response got. objectively. all, check understanding reason reasoning, examining China's argument, can't find anything, know, WHO's reason search first place. People paranoid ""big government"" tracking forcing things. Like realize ""regulation"" already happening lives, blind it. anti-vaxx q-anon crazies love compare Jews germany WWII. think show proof vaccination one step towards holocaust them. Wrong please research Oh no! 

Anyway... Oh, resorting name-calling make feel better, hmm? Fine, go ahead makes feel good.

Anyway...

An article several professors: one's opinion piece, still valid: Look, China freaked SARS, every Asian country sans Japan is. became apparent thing is, freaked addressed properly. reason response slower SARS 1 COVID 19 less death sentence.

We shit handling West even became apparent is, China brigade conspirists exaggerating article deflecting country's shit response.  I’m fine 70% 80% vaccination goal, line sand removing restrictions. determined large part case, hospitalization, death rates. That's kinda point trials, make sufficiently large hopefully diverse enough give us enough assurances efficacy safety approve ""real world"". Trial subjects really real. contracts would stipulate plants countries would get doses when. US contracted initial doses produced US anyway. Canadas initial doses example always going coming Belgium plant anyway export ban affect example VT opens 70-74 age group tomorrow. one oldest states expect open 65-69 March. professions eligible patient care/healthcare. medical conditions priority 65+ done. Scared?   People still struggling get appointments. friends mom Wisconsin needs vaccine doctors surgery otherwise wait 3-4 weeks surgery get vaccine. She’s multiple lists tried smaller pharmacies still can’t get appointment. Unfortunately situation similar mathematics. number papers published increased exponentially (in 2020, 111,628 publications; 2000, 71,630 publications; 1980, 43,383 publications, info mathscinet) however quality definitely decreased. know people publishing like 4x year, crazy. writing essentially paper 4x. thought UT moved teachers list bargaining chip get teachers back schools. Maybe that’s SLC only? Singapore. government staffers actively reading watching forms news every day make sure there's BS.

Gossip/sensational publications short leashes. India’s vaccinations per 1,000 people aren’t high health officials wants be...

That true, life back normal even without vaccines astonishingly, hospital beds still lying empty. surge India never came, despite protests marches sorts. Honestly, people concerned taking non covid denier people really calling mask mandates over? could see reasonable discussion summer got last hump. interesting people's opinion Fauci/lockdowns/covid general changed quickly subreddit. Clearly group influences individual opinions quite lot Wrong well Wrong yet people thought whole seriousness true via mix China conspiracy theories. thing people didn’t think serious becoming known even though us knew hiding severity virus slowly coming out. Especially deaths spread it. completely overblown. read articles 100% speculation designed get clicks. desperate bad news since vaccines working well  ever quickly copy successful nations - sod science! mild cases causing permanent lung damage? I’m sorry, comment thoughtless totally lacking empathy. shouldn’t written did; reading back made realize that. 


I decently severe COVID November. I’m also masked fully compliant idea got it. feel like lot people commenting haven’t COVID don’t respect terrifying be. mistook one them. shouldn’t said anything anyway, unkind. YEEEEES!!!! continue shop businesses force mask mandates watch way acted pandemic over. 

If care money this, never cent money **ever again.** Janet Yellen: ""Back full employment 2022...""

That head scratcher. wonder thinks lowering income threshold stimulus checks good idea. That's correct Pfizer Many things cause pneumonia besides covid. No, would like EU take leading role security. moment lot depends American UK military.

I believe reliable partners anymore. EU relied support lot.

If military won’t anymore. sure especially USA glad save lot money. though? Netherlands requires two tests entry example, US banned tourists Europe (you need green card residency), Spain banned non European tourists without residency card, etc.

It seems like nightmare. planning go back UK Christmas suddenly introduced test requirements Spain lucky UK entered lockdown, complete isolation ""new variants"".

Unless count travelling within region, can't see people would going. China absolutely samples, there’s way hell ever show international community. haven’t already destroyed now. Also thing lot people don’t even know yet part reason virus deadly possible long term effects recovery. put like last year beginning/middle pandemic. wonder world catch via America general people shocked. India cares, vaccines. truth unfortunately. 

Majority white _voters_ sociopathic levels cruel hateful. Like voting policy anymore: spite hate. news addicted doom gloom. read articles, none real evidence speculation. stuff picked good news comes vaccines major snow storm something.

Lol, fair point. Thanks insight. understanding sent press release, study be/has submitted peer review I'm pretty young, 102+ fever body aches could bed sleep 12 hours. slowed normal 24 ""Worrying signs new variant might appear point future could potentially reduce efficacy one specific vaccine"" I'd like go Japan winter personally. planning going last summer but, know. majority people stopped taking seriously around time summer protests, point became clear restrictions ""sometimes necessary"" rather strictly necessary. get pick choose matters public health, consistent objective. becomes okay one group people follow rules, people stop believing ""We're together"" message.   way around.

Specifically, OP comment “who dropped ball?” comment germane. 

The revocation US virologists scientist china well documented, rational removal. 

I’m fine moderation, let us acknowledge US pulled scientists field specifically China/Wuhan shut pandemic prevention efforts bipartisan one reason. 

Connecting actions cause topic. That's shockingly low.  you.

This classic NYT fear mongering Immigration restricted Europe, nightmare get visas wife. actually course action. stones ignore previous statement fire logical fallacy. cryptic bullshit following it. think part say true, given anti-science approach tackling pandemic, made people feel uneasy. That's really reality it. sure one, saw article saw another article someone Covid five months strains mutated time them. notable mutations seeing E484K, N501Y co-evolved. Lmao  mean Australia hasn’t started community transmission. Doesn’t mean set back. US simply catchup deaths left negligence previous administration. mean, he's wrong. That's pretty much certain parts China did. would never fly Western country, though. UK government concerned variants potentially antibody evading adaptations emerging locally imported. Places identified seen mass asymptomatic testing.

It seems likely apart schools, proper opening able happen not-fit-for-purpose contact tracing system able keep variants control. must worse India/Africa, besides higher resistances gonna like oh geez yet another person thinking they're funny quoting username...and saw yours. upvote, friend. Thanks :) want order maintain reserve currency status. dollar also backed belief continue worth something. we're another distant country everyone, Fed printing may actually stop go full Weimar. surprise anybody?

That’s insane city 25 million people high population density Well first used vaccine invented Germany. \*\*shared\*\* American company. factories producing EU also \*\*sharing\*\* vaccine countries.

Cuz healthy people vast majority people. It’s absurd freak possible negative effects minority people. I'm hurt :( Boy wish either American, Chinese Russian, whatever want whoever want. guess country decides publicly meddle irrelevant shit despite being... Canada  Think would liked roll tanks take UK manufactured AZ doses force. fuck fauci quazy eugenics deciding able buy masks not. makes sense honestly didnt see hospitals going home depot hardware stores buy n95's. thats medical field buys supplies. Yeah happen. Even cases, even though participants got Covid, vaccines reduced severity illness. studies like this. Phizer gave us huge amount doses, probably paid for, return deliver Phizer world incredible results. health care system universal, digital, widespread entire country, rich enough operation. 

I hate Netanyahu, defenitly made good call choosing path (and still never vote him). going first country crisis, IMO worth paying extra for.  Thanks, anecdotal evidence better considering doesn’t seem data this. Hope stay safe healthy :) confirm. grandpa die month ago Mexico ""pneumonia"". Tried see could get test died, never happened. relative around test positive week two later. Places lockdown still suffered major economic impact, know, deadly pandemic. Mortality rate nearly doubled (+70%) UK variant probably others mutations. What's threshold? Thanks reply reassuring words. best yours. seems refs split.

I live that. First Mortality rate nearly doubled (+70%) UK variant probably others mutations. What's threshold? United Kingdom large country I'd argue competitive American vaccination effort, I'm sure could playful jokes ""cheated"" smaller population starting earlier. find every country's effort profoundly unimpressive. Obviously Israel, United Arab Emirates, Seychelles excellent job, much smaller populations much smaller area. That's say impressive, countries like Luxembourg Singapore league them, consider countries comparable United States regard.

I think countries compare United States, could talk Canada, China, United Kingdom, Japan, Russia, India, Australia, probably others coming right now. people might count European Union whole. personally feel United States incredible job, distribution actual vaccines. mRNA based vaccines American owned, Moderna's developed here, they've proven resistant variants.

I've often compared distribution vaccines moon landing level achievement, think entire pandemic little comparable space race. United States get first object orbit first man space, landed moon first. Similarly, United States handle early stages pandemic well- Even could debate ""well"" would look like day- looking like we'll crossing finish line lot sooner rest. bizarre weirdly traditional. odd pattern. do. We're decently - much better used - still well enough. keep pressing better, job's done. reading theory four coronaviruses endemic humans probably launched pandemics hundreds thousands years ago. problem quarantining done. school closed in-person learning we’ve open; it’s kids get COVID, teachers quarantine, don’t staff stay open. Thankfully, process getting vaccinated — one dose done awaiting second. soon. year terrible everyone involved. Do- WANT stronger immune response then, even might unpleasant? 

This one seems kept date. confirm, LA area large Chinese population n95 gone middle February 2020, earlier. tf cares want vaccines reopen. I've also trying look it, Hebrew, find it. Sadly expected. Journalism Israel kind meh, one full job. hope full study would released soon, without cooperation Phizer. Second doses ramping up. think 20 million point would probably like 3 weeks? lead time second doses. enough factory shuts supply snag.

Europe delay shipments couple weeks think Biontech factory expanded mid January.

I think they're safe. Also reserved second doses. imagine bunch ensure next week's injection, too. Given everything, stock hand take care next 4-5 injections gives lead time case anything bad happens supply. Like major snow storm something. Thats would start Trump's election year media ready literally destroy society get rid wife person teaching NJ since September. students special needs wear masks. lie get vaccine appointment NJ kept moving teachers list. Somehow one rage quit isn’t petulant child? mental gymnastic another level. I'm sure India give vaccines population vaccinated. likely exact answer got every country. professor cannot explain drop cases sure it’s herd immunity? Sounds fishy. Hang there. cavalry coming, vaccines going dig us mess. light end tunnel here! gotta stick around see it! Israel required international law give Palestinians vaccines. 

This covered 4th Geneva Convention:  check sears website n95s made US nothing bad say Chinese people. Canadian Chinese people. Believe me. CCP government problem with. always get bad side effects regular flu vaccine. feel sick 2 days getting it. bad getting real flu. I'm pointing pushing specific narrative reinforced zero information. mutagenic analyses done regress viruses back lab equal components definitive. 

Also, several Chinese scientists expelled Canada stealing largest, guarded lab country. lab specialized coronavirus research. 

Just yell, call names, say I'm dumb going change fact information provided China stunted, jaded, missing, piecemeal, points thinly veiled attempt hide truth. 

Sorry - I'm expecting tell I'm stupid, call bunch names, accuse stuff do. Even actually 70% deadly, really doubt is, wouldn’t significant young person. Look IFR age group you’ll see nothing ""believe."" raw data look people making statements data.  Please travel yet. may still cases summer, child vaccine approvals coming late year early 2022. responsible; child care for. ""Won't win one."" 

We actually could win one. Health systems know too. getting vaccine mandatory. I've asked friends work heath systems voluntary well. I'm healthcare worker who's refused get vaccine. wife, kids anti-vaxxers either. vaccines. getting covid vaccine. It’s meant defray liability employers. employers taking actions make COVID virtual certainty job (they are), appropriate solution increase employers premiums, deny claims. 

This class people forced go work didn’t go hungry. want talk practicalities let’s recognize people families already backed corner desperate. America little safety nets every issue arises posses possibility severe unrest. 2/14, 7 day moving average new cases actually dropped 63% since peaked 1/11. That's 255K 93K. 

We right path big way must stay course right things, even receiving vaccine. rocket science. breathing thing chief. even barely affects grow up, even chance pass along well worth mask on. Non-sterilizing immunity default assumption, prove otherwise since would extraordinary case find so. 

But since (redo get rid Amp link): recent link showing reduction transmission, zero.

There's another section says EU. quite clear UK excluded section written.

And whether idea good faith argumentation. US going complete entire first round vaccination using exclusively mRNA. already hit 50 million+ vaccinated least one shot 100% mRNA. hoping get vaccinated JandJ approved would much rather superior efficacy mRNA vaccines. adenovirus vectors (AZ, JandJ, Sputnik) effective. One dropped vial, one rip one bio hazard suit, one bit clumsiness

That's pretty charitable view lab security China. WIV getting scrutiny security mean ""oops somebody forgot shower"" like ""a top researcher reprimanded selling lab animals nearby Anyone know FDA going review J&amp;J?  say dismiss it, OP offering anything value saying could've happened writing way suggests that's actually happened. lot scenarios could've happened mentioned.

Tbh cost really matter much rich countries like US Australia. 20, 30, 40 dollars dose pretty tiny compared economic output. absurdly good value money compared massive economic costs imposed restrictions longer, lower consumer confidence medical costs. article pretty alarming title, relevant content inside one sentence claiming three scientists links Chinese government, without giving details all. Quality journalism.

Peter Daszak probably concerning, given head EcoHealth alliance, non-profit partnered WIV fund coronavirus research. 3, would incentive avoid investigating lab leak theory.

As two, could find link Peter Ben Embarek China worked Beijing office 2009-2011, advising Chinese govt food safety. exactly I’d call damning link. Marion Koopmans, seems adviser Guangdong CDC since 2007 based information LinkedIn, however degree involvement pretty unclear. primary employment research activity seems bulk work Europe Middle East.

I’d welcome entertain info, article really doesn’t much substance behind fiery title. Another example lockdowns done generally harm good US be. Canada target also fully vaccinated end summer (despite currently reading Canada's vaccination rate). UK well (in fact ahead projections moment).

Does anyone know EU target month is? Australia started yet small enough population leftover US production alone likely sufficient fully vaccinate year. First infographic clearly shows UK part EU vaccination powerhouse.

Second page exactly 23rd May 2020 way COVID vaccines even something, *anything* indicates 70% COVID vaccines exported produced EU. right clear full rubbish. No, I'm advocating that. Lots countries managed control without going far China, example Vietnam.

This black white either thing. large, West failed protect people going major consequences terms ideology Western moral superiority. lot countries looking US shaking heads. end sight not? vaccines effective enough not? going go 2022 not?  Lmao stop calling Pfizer vaccine already?
I know headline still wrong. UK variant 70% deadly- bad that? young female read article stating variant might deadly me. live idiots go bars. wear mask apartment transmissible- shower such. deal 70%- death rate that? many tests? deleted anything. question? That's exactly reason hesitant recommend masks outside medical settings back early part pandemic. Who's talking two separate circles? one circle, living life. choose cower home part it, choice.

Still waiting study. 7 day average new cases America dropped 65% month continues fall day. There’s people saying cancel every restriction, they’re majority. majority people saying stop printing fear mongering bullshit. I’m fine following guidelines months, please stop telling sky falling need quadruple mask another 2 years. I’m sick it. 

Every jurisdiction seeing cases fall cliff despite super scary variants 1000% scary original model. get it, stay vigilant little longer, fucking say that. can’t wait never hear names Fauci Osterholm ever again. mean government requiring it. 

Like hosting party want catering employees vaccinated. government overreach. 

Or choose go doctor's office doctors vaccinated. 

Private parties choosing business government overreach. need evidence every hypothesis. Bat caves, frozen food, mink farms, gain function research -- they're unlikely something still happened.

Viruses getting labs nothing new. happens time less dangerous pathogens even viruses escaping labs infecting general population new.

There's good reason dismiss lab leak straight away. doesn’t matter whether seven variants contagious. matters contagious survive spread evade vaccines spread vaccinated population. end sight though? keep seeing vaccines essentially useless long virus keeps mutating we’re going keep going back square one over. used pretty optimistic things would get better summer, I’m quickly losing hope. Since happily deleted comments (or mods did) I'd like ask give actual answer. political condition really fucked right now. government trying suppress voice common people farmers. showing pure image rest world time destroying image. Except India’s vaccinations per 1,000 people aren’t high health officials wants be... play vital role production Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine.

I'm sure difference everyday life private functions are. Private functions part everyday life? took long disgusted country's selfishness? **Can vaccinated people spread virus?**

Any answer get either ""yes"" ""no"" wrong, now. ""maybe, probably not"", going way long time.

In order answer question scientifically, would require ""challenge study"" vaccinated unvaccinated people deliberately exposed virus see transmission occurs.

The ethical concerns deliberate exposure prevent us performing studies humans. reason vaccine trials took long, can't deliberately infect people see need hospitalization die.

However, studies hamsters, results looked pretty bad. able spread it. hamsters greet touching noses like time. Humans really (do you?). similar studies monkeys results look really good.

Also, notice reputable person talking subject always says ""may able spread"", ""maybe"", ""we know if"". that's small chance vaccinated people able spread virus. big chance. Doctors, scientists, regulators careful language subject, would argue they're careful. said, say ""vaccinated people cannot spread virus"", find situations vaccinated people spread virus, would end worse hedge while. least me, way they're framing seems pretty reasonable, put shoes.

**Additional Thoughts/Cool likely cheaper vaccine made redditor.

But wait, many words change make whole sculpture really different, work sculpture anymore? Really many they're right spots, right? variants suck viruses; rare mistake would make instructions *better*.

**Which vaccine get?**

When someone asks favorite beer is, answer always same.

It's one front me.

So get first vaccine can, differences pretty minor.

**Booster questions think about, answers**

(note: there's difference ""boost"" ""booster"" needs understood.)

(also, what's term mixture sequences, heterogenous? doubt term overthinking?)

(also also, I'm convinced we're definitely going need boosters, fun think about.)

Could booster shot replace second dose prime/boost regimen?

Should booster shot use one sequence mRNA (or identical spike proteins), both/multiple?

For future vaccines, sequence/spike prime/boost different? four spikes/sequences, would make sense two each, four each?

How much trust mutation modeling here? anticipate future mutations include them? good enough yet?

Do need give non-booster doses people recovered infection?

Could ""stretch"" doses mRNA booster priming vaccine that's easier manufacture, maybe less effective (like ChAdOx1), boost mRNA booster? Could better faster prime current mRNA sequence boost updated ChAdOx1? vaccines reduce infections, someone gets infection getting vaccinated, fewer reduced symptoms. currently seems also true post vaccination infection known variants. pretty sure reduction indication they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure reduce spread people truly asymptomatic barely spread virus, people mild symptoms spread slightly more, people go develop severe symptoms spread virus really well. 

In words: reduction symptoms least correlated reduction ability spread virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections symptoms get infected. Therefore, vaccines reduce spread.

If people develop immunity via clearing infection, subsequent variant exposed broaden immune response, likely without disease (symptoms). they'll good broad immunity variety variants, seems likely indication catch spread virus well future. thing happens someone vaccinated exposed new variant. immunity broadened strengthened subsequent exposure, likely without symptoms. remember, many people less likely spread virus, pretty unlikely reduced level spread sufficient sustain virus way seen past year. variant becomes somewhat widespread, it'll hit resistance pretty quickly. become widespread, Yay!

I'm totally willing mind changed new information though, take gospel. (Just gigantic asshole it, please. I've block one person.)

Tips clarifying terms/language/understanding appreciated. miss something could help people? Please let know!

You’ll disappointed keys think they’re comparable Hawaii, IMO I've pretty bad colds life, lol. Haha US , course 😂 figures. individualism arent you? Guess part reason badly virus first place....

 ps - long virus uncontrollable part world , rest world remains vulnerable, whether vaccinated stronger , vaccine resistant strains begin emerge 🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️ teach face-to-face Purdue. course teach difficult adapt online format. students quarantine positive COVID19. Sure would nice could start vaccinating soon. That's travel another country. equivalent. No, eligible. I’ve also seen lots people know work remotely educators also get vaccine early. know it’s complicated, I’m saying rules murky over. Love support teachers tho, y’all deserve soooo much general.

United States Perhaps confused read entire context comment thread. think misinterpreting. chance government mandates vaccine passport enter grocery store conduct normal business. 

That said possible mandate international travel, health care settings school. already require vaccines. 

Or private individuals choose business unvaccinated. 

For example, family hiring live aid elderly relative hiring someone unvaccinated? government overreach, private party vs private party. dunno, sure shit social distancing years end. They're going motions 'just case'. reality platforms (not adeno) emerge approved quicker 'go to' boosters/variants. ""especially since everything know points non-sterilizing immunity""

Then section discriminates UK, among facilities line AZ breach contract, they'd sued, happening. EU know they'd lose.

This realm possibility, EU moment, since would counter productive, suddenly production yields improved contract came public lol - interesting no?

Bottom line this: vaccine nationalism alive well, USA UK export bans place they're allowing private companies manage production fulfill contracts countries. good EU placed export controls, keep check EU orders start show - enough fuckery big pharma. person teenager living parents different. think people would problem forced quarantine facility? Ramp vaccine production, taking account percentage population either refuse take vaccine, population can't take vaccine approved yet (under 16's) 130 countries either extremely poor greatly controlled pandemic. absolutely budget vaccines delay mainly incompetence government.

SINGAPORE: Singapore reported nine new COVID-19 cases noon Monday (Feb 15), imported infections.

All new cases placed stay-home notice upon arrival, said Ministry Health (MOH) update. 

No locally transmitted cases reported community foreign worker dormitories. third consecutive day community COVID-19 cases. 

A permanent resident returned India among nine imported cases, dependant's pass holder work pass holder arrived United Arab Emirates.

Two imported cases work permit holders arrived Bangladesh Indonesia, one domestic worker.

The remaining four infections short-term visit pass holders. Three arrived India Nigeria visit family members Singaporeans permanent residents, case arrived Indonesia job placement.

They tested serving stay-home notice.

MOH said 20 COVID-19 cases discharged hospitals community isolation facilities. total 59,641 fully recovered infection.

There 36 COVID-19 patients still hospital, stable improving, one person critical condition intensive care unit.

Another 103 cases isolated cared community facilities. people mild symptoms clinically well still test positive COVID-19. Well since confident, please point anything contradictory I've someone diagnosed cancer, would assume cancer?

I can't tell everyone trolling moronic. think said almost exact opposite said.

Are aware there's middle ground? know something false mean automatically true. evidence one way another, stance know. see article? 130 countries administered ZERO vaccines last 2 months. enough go around. Source samples provide wastewater blood donation requested even? Good thing China monitoring SARS viruses else may noticed pandemic brewing, considering US EU sure didn't. good analyzing samples many months narrative already cemented. bad US look samples earlier late 2019.... told friend planning state trip July (from Florida Pennsylvania). me, husband, family vaccinated. Friend said itd soon 1 year old can't get vaccine. I've inside since birth. July 1.5 years since indoor dining, seeing friends, ect. insane thinking July ok? think reasonable. Also, would adjust trip according case numbers something happens. Thing child may able get vaccine years approved little kids. January 19, people experience mutant people U.K. England dominant strain there. studied extensively tell us although it’s associated greater degree transmissibility person person, person-by-person basis, appear virulent actually means doesn’t make sicker,” Dr. Fauci said. 

He contradicts often. quarantine always longer 3 days

Really? think so. Forcing people reset temporarily every case ridiculous. 

Why? infintely better US let people die. Fauci, unfortunately, wholly bought idea lies/exaggerations public health officials worthwhile tools modify public behaviour.

He fully admitted regards masks herd immunity. would surprising here. 

He thinks people safer think variants deadly - regardless whether actually true.

It's terrible philosophy going lead less trust science, conspiracy theories, clearly believes it.  [This Israeli vaccine mic drop moment. go, folks. That's vaccines do. link list public statements NERVTAG found It’s Nervtag. Look statements past. Hard take serious point. know lot people done this, moved back near family warmer nicer areas 6-12 months re-evaluate things open back up. work home, work anywhere... Yeah, keep seeing word ""heterogeneity"", relation talking about. IIRC, herd immunity models assume perfect mixing various populations getting Covid cases, reality there's much mixing people getting bulk Covid cases (essential workers) everyone else Seems like Trump right. really thought sub coming senses. Guess happened run authoritarian morons once. 👏 AstraZeneca vaccines gonna thrown around like hot potatoes country country. know complete farce. Look every instance there’s “outbreak.” quarantine always longer 3 days. Forcing people reset temporarily every case ridiculous. remember Covid became real personally good friend battled last summer. walls closing felt vulnerable. Now, opposite happening vaccines, end seems real personally family friends get it. 

It’s hard imagine plan future, it’ll come. hang on. real lockdown NYC months ago. There’s truth idea places US lockdown lockdown. 

Some people think limit Covid = lockdown way would put is, major trend happening really understand lot better. Cases dropping rapidly across country, we're back October.

Was December/January one-time spike? sudden increase testing around holidays dropping off? getting closer 50%+ immunity? cold weather many parts country keep people away one another? combination factors?

It probably little early vaccinations affecting cases vaccinations among elderly generally lower cases higher illness. Or, could say health care essential workers contributing spread immune vaccinated stopping.

What shocks surprises trend seemingly almost attention ""experts"" media. heard new increase high point along way along dire warnings increased lockdowns restrictions, cases free fall silence. Positivity rates remain high (above 3% everywhere US), despite total caseloads plummeting. point positivity rate less effective indicator was, example, last spring? Seasonal colds flus historic lows. Allergies less challenging winter....at point, low prevalence conditions would test negative impact positivity rate? Would demand testing better indicator point (dropping quickly)?  We’ve opened schools live, problem. Clear protocols, everyone abides. We’ve zero outbreaks last three months. It’s manageable Uhm...Cuba is, alwsys, pulling weight some. 

So much even though I'm US, I'm willing travel Cuba get vaccine there. That's entirely different argument. individual person, 1% chance much all. Even 0.1% rate could lot people infected literally entire population.

No, 20 year olds ""heightened rate"" anything. one lowest, chance serious problems low. Multiple countries Europe debates covid zero strategy pursue. simply wrong. described situation exact way. Could said better. downsized office, roughly 80 people admin office....now 4 offices 8 desks reserved day. However it’s somehow even depressing going seeing 5-6 people unsustainable? economy completely open months restrictions except letting people country, still quarantine. already zero COVID, 3 days again. It’s really not. export ban, US contracted doses produced anyway. export ban puts weight criminal law behind purchases. exec gets bribed UAE divert doses, he’s risking breach contract, company would financially responsible, he’s risking going jail. seems early call significant setback. They've one two small outbreaks last year every time short lockdown averted going community spread. soon say one way another whether follow pattern. *Nobody get you.* 

The pandemic end, likely year. “new normal changes” probably going extremely minor, like curbside pickup permanent option maybe you’ll see one two masks public people choose so. 

This idea anyone looking keep restrictions around permanently stance sub made up. Nobody real world trying this. it’s effecting badly, log off. fucking way used analogy, please read back wrote loud hahaha

If someone diagnosed cancer, would assume cancer? there's proof *don't* cancer, must automatically mean definitely cancer? completely anti-thetical evidence based approach proving hypothesis, god help go Uni Unpopular opinion here, actually like Zoom meetings.

It's much easier multitask bullshit meeting could hashed email instead, rather in-person look like paying attention. Yeah leave Mexican government going crap. However combination vaccination cards required stuff access privately purchased vaccines come rescue Mexican population. improve anyone's image. India manufacturers vaccines large quantities. business diplomacy paywall. Link think effects vary dramatically person person. first dose didn’t feel anything, meanwhile roommate flu symptoms lasting night. I’ve heard lot people second dose hits lot harder, prepared case Considering we've vaccinated 30 million people 30 days think production bottleneck people getting vaccines. dispensation infrastructure. sounds sort racist though nothing employers keep employees payroll though?

Correct. vaccinated 1/12 sister not.  got sick virus developed symptoms positive test result several days ago. I’m confident vaccine received gave level protection, still got infected nonetheless Russia die covid, covid dies Russia thought 10 mil ready go March 1, 100 mil end June.

Clearly messaging place J&amp;J doses lol. already are.. saying uk version 70% deadly that’s different trying “one state solution” Yikes. covid stay long run still think China one countries able detect something like early on. 

Their authoritarian style helps lot, whatever people may think CCP, technocrats, believe science, think fuck-up SARS probably also improved abilities/procedures/protocols detect new viruses. I'm sure, knew number, I'd probably far conscientious future actions. you?

I'm sure agree things stay abstract. Clear &amp; truthful information seems always beneficial route, opinion.  yes do, days ago first viral load studies associated real world vaccinations look viral load pfizer see lots discussion around topic last days Especially vaccine. get vaccine risk group chance mask goes trash. It’s worth keeping mind **first** doses, though. Second doses delayed, although makes sense logistical perspective, might backfire reduced immunity leading mutations, example. Let’s hope doesn’t happen... True containment anything 3,300 daily cases US.

Considering fact everyone ever get vaccinated considering transmissible disease is, seems unlikely ""containment"" happen time foreseeable future. virus far folded human population point.

However, that's reason despair since think we'll hit point disease prevalence low enough (under 10k/day) we'll stop counting cases hospitalizations deaths way we're today. Sure, people still fall ill even die COVID, disrupt society meaningful way. 

Once pandemic phase disease (almost certainly end year developed world), think we'll much better job living influenza. flu really tough nut crack humans centuries. general public cared much potentially.

Apologies rambling... love shit. Let’s say well Biden he’s able accomplish month office. guy who, INAUGURATION SPEECH, said people died COVID WW2. (Trumps fault know) but.. Trump inherited Obama’s successes.. Biden own. America fucking joke. part America actually ever closed lol saying side effects. I'm saying exposed shortly (or even before) getting vaccine, going level protection someone who's exposed 14 days second dose. BioNtech Also vaccinated people stop masking create big muddle exposure uncertainty, we'll see lot unmasked people sure they've vaccinated like wearing masks get away it.  It’s going happen. lack vaccinations countries means get mutations. Potentially making vaccinations useless. vaccinate everyone world speed USA doing, get rid it. get disagree scientific facts, get wrong. good day. I’ll let know go downhill head ER.

Relax, friend . Viruses new, even Coronaviruses. human body resilient, fact stronger virus. Add science we’ll beat it, continue beat  things stay abstract. many times indirectly killed someone going supermarket flu? Feels reals, amirite?!? largest single funder covax, yes. I've also heard people covid strong reaction / side effects first dose. Bruh, check blood sugar Kool-Aid drinking. Really makes wonder much Trump dismantling pandemic preparedness unit made difference catching thing early? J/J hit 60m end April target

That's target? Omg feel much better. Idk assumed it'd like ~10-15mil per month May bunch May. Probably news production delays awhile back. No, US domestic vaccine production capacity pandemic preparedness developed Bush Obama. Trump cut finding several projects, CDC advance teams, certainly *expand* capacity way aware of.

Case point, Medicago, Canadian company, built main production facility North Carolina *in 2010* received funding US pandemic preparedness programs. Canadian facility funded started construction last year… oops.

Trump inherited one best prepared countries pandemic, think US's performance pandemic reflects that. I'm sure Trump apologists find excuses, data pretty stark.

Trump's Executive Order necessary he'd actually ordered vaccine either, even know much helped. Biden rescinded though, expect stay place least couple months.

The rate vaccinations rolling probably testament ""American industry"" general, Biden administration's commitment effective governance, legacy preparedness stretching back decade. Given reality think really fair look vaccination numbers assume US's numbers reflect fantastic government policy Canada's numbers reflect poor government policy.

Alternatively, could argue Canada failing secure domestic production vaccines instead relying US, Eurpoe, India poor policy. mean, discuss that, would include Israel responsible Gaza West Bank(as per Oslo Accords) thr fact Israel offer vaccines Palestinian government rejected them.

Yes, assumption even age distribution probably quite hold. figure right ballpark. And, someone else pointed out, preferentially selecting elderly people, would make figure lot higher. dark without early facts. powerful minds around world scores years expertise. political game played. China acting like petulant child. still solid political agenda regarding science. US new process. assume undermined, disassembled, abandoned last US administration.

China wins momentary point, loses game. Figuring better masks important early easy.  People take early fumbling mixed messaging seriously actually time people supposed staying home.  Yet crap spouted trump (it disappear, warm weather kills it, cases drop nothing, get we’re good treating it’s almost like nothing) way egregious frequency scope. Highly unlikely considering closely related SARS Cov 2 Chinese bat coronaviruses. Got mine, fuck talking joke, getting herself. reinforces said, then. said sick, wear mask, mentioned China South Korea specifically fairly typical practices post-SARS times. data show airborne time long held belief sick people wear masks stop spread respiratory illnesses. Things change data scrutiny. We've got em everywhere. wonder gamed simulations would've happened done xyz. seems radically different paltry vaccines given December half January.  Europe able get case rates low numbers summer, unable stamp second wave, ended big bigger first wave spring

The second wave much bigger first wave, based official numbers. first wave cumulative case count 300K EU countries even tiny EU countries going cumulative 1M case count right read history books  US earlier Jan 2020 many community cases connection anyone China. People getting infected unknown sources. Jan people picked really responsible initial outbreaks. 

We see test properly weeks months past Jan 2020. infections already well underway point.

Also, initial outbreak could less infectious, less deadly China strain. really European strain devastated US really caught attention. Well, shoot, let go take chances test subject legal recourse something happens inject molecule God knows 5 years could potentially open to!

That's sound logic right there! 

I feel safe taking product company killed 11 children Nigeria permanently disabled hundreds one non approved vaccines took upon inject children with. 

No permission consent parents, got sued $6B, paid crooked AG $75M, case vanished. that's *one* case.

And company gets ""immunity"" prosecution lawsuits current vaccine.

Riiiiiiiiiight. follow general data trend... must circulated early November maybe October ... means international community then...  What? Palestinians. Tell ask UAE Morocco KSA, Bahrain, good Arabs. Iran offers free weapons offers zero vaccine.

The Palestinians bid offshore gas money pay everyone $10,000 plus give free vax. rich. But, today, one say.

The gift 5000 doses treated like dirt, enough, give us more. else what? threat plea? 

If Palestinians tapped offshore gas, estimated every man, woman child would earn one hundred thousand dollars per year, every year decades. now, want whatever think option, poverty, apparently unappreciative free gift non Arab country. need video call doctor taking Covid test? worried people faking tests skewing numbers? sort political reason? never happier considered obese yeah goes quickly “unsure worst case” “this worst case actual fact this” Holy fuck reality living in? Absolute insane comment Transparency accountability much apparently enough doses fully vaccinate every American June chances seem good average person get around please right real lesson China, looking entire past 12 months one peak over, aggressively try stamp new outbreaks. Unlike US, Italy Europe able get case rates low numbers summer, unable stamp second wave, ended big bigger first wave spring. Say NOW


Why even troops Australia??? Everyone says thier family members putting ground. certainly changed family's opinion ""going back normal"" ""lockdowns"". change mind too. Why? Lol. Stop ridiculous conspiracies. agree. New York, huge amount people essential workers stay home. hardly lockdown. Almost everyone know worked pandemic. oddly personal attack matter genuine curiosity. Yeah sure, Easter meme again. people never learn Debbie downer it’s open season mean everyone anyone able vaccinated then. likely several months, like fall closer full vaccination. definitely makes sense though, otherwise would open go straight another lockdown 1-2 months later continue cycle. think anywhere near amount guess underestimated us shitshow put last 12+ months... vaccines ineffective.

Everything seems think thst everyone going go ""fuck mode"", start burying family members. family said thing... ""We can't stop living"", ""we can't lock forever"", ""but mah mental health"". uncle first cousin proved fact stop living. Funny everyone singing different tune now. grant government power strip away individual choice :/ 16/18 years old ~250 million latter. Well shit want 20s back Thankyou, don’t know question got downvoted hell simply asking advice haha recovered faster developed economies. Unemployment 4.9%, lower majority OECD economies despite lack tourism.

We spent last fall/winter without covid confident ability continue manage it.

People irrationally afraid state score higher every freedom index countries decided let hundred thousands die. Social distancing won’t long. Cases across board vaccines rolling faster faster day. yeah, year ago weeks Super Bowl wave coming Taiwan detected covid January 2019 warning it. even restricted travelling period. brushed Taiwan report wasn’t recognised country. course spread bigger anticipated December. 11 month passed since first case detected Taiwan. fewer old people per capita developed nations.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Cringe. Im sure they'll ok...after British German colonialism, natural resource theft, wars, duplicitous puppets diamonds, gold, nickle uranium kill them, Im pretty sure they'll fine.

Their DNA bloodline continent far longer europe existed far europe gone.

A virus 98% survival rate going kill all..im sure they've seen *far* worse.

Contact europeans impact death rate Covid ever will. like say this, sure hope so! I'm optimistic. Context? Wats dat? I've vaccinated still feel weird around strangers closed spaces christmas novel virus horizon.

Knock wood... Same, lol. Except I'm enthusiastically burning them. I'd rather buy state reinstates mandates form reminder cluttering house. United States I’d imagine everything open summer. Americans didn’t care virus year ago sure hell don’t care now. vaccines hit like 50%+ states opened regardless federal government figures say.  changing professional opinion ac changing situation lying? hospitals short medical supplies? That's problem! They/the government better prepared (this ""superpower"" world it?) surprised particular user decided suddenly post article negative 2020 title, also happens paywalled? *New Zealand entered chat* How? Social media caused global pandemic novel zoonotic virus? Lol sorry, I’m really sure you’re trying say. world, variants definitely potential problem That's ridiculous. even make sense. problem reopening schools. Schools shouldnt open, thus dont deserve vaccine. workers whose jobs cannot done distance get vaccined first. live schools operating remotely. Australia winter comparison wonder... Fauci apologist

Jesus Christ US doomed. Right, differences due governmental failings. Unless invested deep Calvinism believe people get government deserve therefore guilty definition. covid pre-destination, will. People US told ""stay home,"" given means actually support action. I'm sorry, condemning victims covid fate like blaming victims autocratic regime it. last thing want country foreign nations giving millions dollars top scientists get government. 

What nightmare would be. 

Hopefully he's allowed donate money US based scientific research. Hint, lottery tickets.

J J better vaccine great number ways. Medically excellent vaccines, ignorant opinion junk. watch Fauci fraud. Kay Mullis inventor PCR test called untrustworthy personal gain. admit winter wave lot worse expected, US going hit 250k cases per day again. sure live virtually ended I’m at. mask wearing public life completely normal. exactly feel. We'll bounce back soon though.  indefinite though. Fauci said continue wearing masks ""Several Months"". Last time checked, several months thing indefinite. Sorry thats soon enough you.

I believe downswing thing light end tunnel framing oppressive, indefinite trampling rights makes seem like impatient, petulant child. Florida recorded like 3000 cases today wanting hear ever =/= wanting government think ever again. want take preventive action, want dominate news cycle every single day.

I want hear Dr. Fauci CDC constantly over, mean want Dr. Fauci drop face earth CDC disband. want thing quietly background. mean, one who's convinced America hellhole lot COVID cases. I'm telling absolutely fine outside hospitals. need get social media.

We'll back old normal soon enough. Social media took old world, end result. wrong. United States 7-day average going drop 90k today, outlets barely finished pressing send “below 100k” stories Among others, 92 low middle income countries participating COVAX well close EU partners exempt controls begin with, i.e. appear list even said, probably many exports (in number doses) going poorer countries moment.)  You, like wife teaching age 62, totally deserve get it. Uhhh right idea, guess, letting bunch randos think right question scientific data could get hand pretty quick. Bottom line: fine, skeptical, know place. wrong? *You might want tell Uni students lockdown scepticism remote learning huge advantage. seem think is.*

I've met Seattle last year, country. They're much enjoying it. secret get campus college pricks get set rules rent place favorite city US Mexico. folks complaining usually ones foolishly decided keep living campus even though classes remote.

*Sounds like even though life normal, many people not. many people young vulnerable.*

I'd say ~80% US able enjoy 2020 thanks freedoms we've had. Would nice reached zero COVID? Yes. second best option. pity folks Europe living hardcore lockdowns. think he's corrupt greedy. However, think made catastrophically bad errors judgement regarding communications early on. 

I active china_flu subreddit (when main Coronavirus sub) back December/January last year. remember watching things unfold like slow-moving train wreck. saw China mandating masks, taking extremely aggressive approach virus. assumed we'd here....may us started buying supplies. 

I, along everyone else sub, totally horrified Fauci CDC flat said people wearing masks. knew respiratory infection already, also knew SARS masks effective.

The entire argument protecting supply healthcare workers bs. hospitals using entirely separate supply chains. tried donating masks early nobody would even accept first unless came approved medical vendors.

This guidance set stage entire anti-mask movement gain footing. genuinely think Fauci said ""yes, masks work, limited supplies""...and came plan rationing them, would anti mask movement all.

He also wishy washy possible overall guidance. ""mayyybee wash hands, maybe probably keep little distance people"". never said single, definitive ""Do this, shit hit fan."" 

Lack clear, definitive guidance every state/municipality rolled half-assed lockdown measures full holes never actually worked. Sueing non profit vaccine company world pandemic might go well. gets paid, nice bonus him. 100% deserves it, lead America pandemic Trump couldn't. so. Workers Comp paying work-related illnesses decades. Proving causation difficult, far impossible. many illnesses known predominantly, cases exclusively, work related. whole idea comp employers get limited liability exchange forgoing civil courts agreeing carry insurance. good reason exclude work-related illness arrangement. Nate taken lot heat twitter agree Osterholm/Fauci/Walensky party line willing question wisdom Teachers hate call child care providers. job.  No, actually. doesn’t make sense want aim impossible goal making sure nobody ever gets sick. Especially comes cost record-breaking increases suicides, overdoses, cancer deaths due delayed diagnosis/treatment, homicides, starvations, etc. bullshit.  landlord. Fixed house, made sure well keeped place someone live. Always fix things broke. time trouble made less $200 per month. tenets happy well looked after. friends done same.  Obviously clue world really works. wife, teacher MN elevated risks, gets second shot next week. massive relief. MN setting aside vaccines educators child care workers, nearly enough go around. *Every* stage?  wonder extreme cold weather throughout country help drive cases even people able gather all. absolutely junk compared real vaccines, lmao. would think personally invested J&amp;J much hardon sub subpar vaccine option. 

Let’s say offer two lottery tickets. prize identical, one gives 95% chance winning gives 72% chance. one right mind going pick second one. Yes, 72% still great number it’s best choice, it’s dogshit compared 95%. I’m sure hard morons understand someone says don’t want J&amp;J vaccine.

TL;DR: shut fuck sit down. situation New Mexico right now. That's science *is* ...... point say masks ""don't work"" like people keep purporting. 

He said stage pandemic, known asymptomatic spread big factor well large proportion population infected, masks unnecessary asymptomatic members public business.

Which happened fair call time, information available them. 

I'm sick idiots replaying ""gotcha"" moment. revise advice situation changed data came in? Yes. course conversation right premature. 

I’m thinking mid-Q3, everyone wants vaccine would already gotten maybe people willing discuss starting phase out. make political? mean? 

Masks decent intervention keep economy open possible. plenty places mask compliance high, like impossible thing group people do. like telling people avoid sex, putting something face around people outside household. KF94s comfortable, spend $30 pack next months.

Our choices basically nothing lot death, put masks keep almost everything open death, lock everyone completely minimize death. three options sort economic emotional cost, think people would agree masks least damaging those.

The group wants mitigation seems feel economy rebound 100% even death virus around us. That's people sheltering place going act mask mandates go away soon. anything, lead additional economic pain people avoid essential economic activities due risk around unmasked people. Well, Japanese producing vaccine, ready end year earliest. resources pull Operation Warp Speed UK/Russian equivalents. stored properly, wet newspaper last forever *more saying freedom important health safety others.*

I'm Governor President Fauci, get decide freedoms people have. I'm merely explaining I've almost every freedom desire past year, Australians enjoyed 2020.

*We turn TV, see countries daily deaths higher us*

Total mortality increased 15% last year US. ideal, also plague-like numbers. Sucks families involved, end world.

*contract they’re national lockdown Number 3 realise life bit better.*

We 1 lockdown US, primarily applies places like Israel UK third lockdown. depends fast approved vaccines produced used.

BTW Novavax already working bivalent vax use current vax plus one targeting variant discovered South vaccine proven safe &amp; effective easier get approval modification this. FDA EU setting rules trials variant booster vaccines like this, something similar process flu vax need 30,000 trial paticipants. COVID-19 cause sepsis never give pockets lined cash social lives completely destroyed. controlled democratically rich equal. great people give back care others, rich like Sackler family greedy sociopaths. plenty rich like Ray Dalio advocate reduction unhealthy extremes wealth equality still supporting capitalism. pretty standard vaccines mutate, common flu vaccine. Science real. Support science! don’t know, recently finally watched clip Bill Gates Colbert prediction “pandemic 2” creeped tf out. Unfortunately, recent announcements paint less optimistic picture.

[Supply start \~2M doses doses end Also use surgical masks face shields see patients. dont enough n95s use unfortunately. North Carolina students going back school teachers vaccinated yet. mention need two doses immune take least month assuming get now, look like they'll even able apply 24th Nah, Mexico also getting shipments well. mother March antibodies still found January. did. Try reading again. vaccines need still problem. could could done much faster case. Blaming spread/case numbers noncompliance doesn’t cut anymore. accurate, numbers Florida California would different. friend told last night blood disorder developed getting vaccine. told already got whatever happens, happens.

Rage Well bring reply? Good him. deserves lifelong body work. nothing else deserves putting Trump grace patience us would able do. mention death threats family endure. country 'has' produce vaccine - interests otherwise whim nation state directly purchasing from. know anyone western country disapproving others using russian Chinese vaccines - every step towards global vaccination helps. Yup. ""definitely going forward planned"", according govt. shall see. probably vaccine probably we're tracking closer natural herd immunity. LAPD doesn’t even power stop vagrants terrorizing people absolute global embarrassment. really hope human species 90% general population anti-science. sound normal me.

My kids go school. nephew goes uni. normal stress free childhood, adolescence young adulthood. might want tell Uni students lockdown scepticism remote learning huge advantage. seem think is.

My elderly vulnerable mum completely normal life. mask. whatever likes.

Sounds like even though *your* life normal, many people not. many people young vulnerable. never convert rubles head. there's thing good billionaire Criticism ""vaccines work, let's rely natural immunity"". correct, take far. hope currently would put athletes essential workers am. would political nightmare supported. Also tourism international student parts economy simply evaporated. can’t read article it’s paywall still firmly believe poverty job losses lockdowns eventually kill much young healthy people COVID actually disease elderly infirm.  rubles? Right Justin Trudeau's main export supporting American progressive policies course won’t exactly match numbers still don’t support conspiracy theory feds intentionally “hiding cases” 

Not cases end deaths that’s moot point US vaccination program excellent continuously improving. dont think US vaccine issues all. 65+ people know gotten 1st shots. dont expect anyone 50 getting vaccinated outside frontline healthcare yet.  time people realized virus problem countries (March 2020 so), already pretty widespread. makes eliminating much harder. NZ started hundred cases.

Also, Australia NZ islands, makes lot easier control border. Despite huge advantage, still new outbreaks (and new draconian lockdowns) regular basis. way place like US would able maintain zero covid. Yeah, think target at-risk, agree sentiment defined point masks go away... hospitalization risks associated highly infectious disease high even people 50 comfortable, I'd extra pissed people prioritized vaccination ran around maskless got sick (not personally, I've vaccinated). 

However, think need frank discussion when, barring extraordinary circumstances around variants new disease something along lines. I'm sure many people 50 would agree another year even elevated risk themselves, think wrong look data make value judgement. set reasonable set metrics returning normal, let's work toward that. groundhog day-esque bullshit ""two weeks"" ""100 days"" getting old, patience wearing thin. hidden? city. lol gr8 b8 m8 looked NY Times app today (not sure I’m still subscribing...)

Exactly, garbage pandemic brought toward bottom list. However, “over” book safely get rid masks. kinda get it. USA response absolute shitshow till want something better countries. making lot vaccines getting peoples arms. 

They want successful countries pointing could done thing without mountain dead bodies. want feel good progress making. celebrate quick, still week see anything Super Bowl parties, even states lifted restrictions. 

Then Mardi Gras, Spring Break, St. Patrick's Day, Easter. Even Valentine's Day Lent might lead spread. Mass testing, enforced quarantine nothing “totalitarian genocidal dictatorship”. CCP horrible things doesn’t mean clusterfuck COVID responses western countries better China’s COVID response. It’s like Canada stopped producing vaccines though they’re producing Covid vaccines. still need vaccines many illnesses. every country switched production covid vaccines would mean people would die illnesses. possibility we’re seeing transmission less common means people don’t need direct contact."" said Verrall, Associate Minister Research, Science Innovation Minister Seniors.

Hey pal, simply reported state’s numbers didn’t advocate anything. flipped protocols, complete all-caps shouting. brought topic up, me. 

I don’t time shouters can’t discuss things rationally, last time I’ll bother reading posts. Bye! Watch out, we's got poet ova hea! great make live average 1-2 years otherwise would. Instead saving others still decades life left them. Yeah, no. second get second jab mask going garbage. old people 60 vaccine? okay vaccinated without worrying effect them? Ive read articles negative side effects old people Im skeptical getting grandparents vaccinated. plan get father sister vaccinated grandparents still protected inside house. News flash Canada still one countries able vaccinate scale.
Unfortunately delayed several weeks. 

Amazing fact since Canada domestic vaccine industry would impossible create one year could create 40-80 million doses. 
let alone gamble vaccine chose produce year ago human trials. Spain water sample highly doubted. could end massive problem, longer delayed chances get variant jumps vaccines. Really sure US government stepped manufacture 24/7. Unless following science anymore. way could possibly happen goal posts move though

Imagine if, throughout time, goalposts never moved science. almost like, learn, evolve, etc. saying we're making right moves, can't assume something stated one point time, can't change another point time. goalposts always moved ""science."" Good news everyone... /Prof. Fansworth solid info appears schools begin return 8th March, we'll know info later month. bad, you’re right thanks controbutingto dragging out. think issue comes ""support"" one supporting Lockdowns...they viewed necessary evil, evil none less.

That's frustration comes in. Lockdowns rather glorified sub last year instead viewed necessary evil.

That highly offensive us work ""locked down"" industries even industries related them, minimizes damage they've caused.

Now minimize damage virus caused, without Lockdowns would much worse even virus killed half million people US alone. lot people portraying Lockdowns = good, virus = bad reality Lockdown = really bad, virus = probably worse without Lockdown. Yea live Indiana, one worst states entire country whose government RAPIDLY running everything ground. aha obviously interact lot israelis. blunt, sarcastic, silly totally standard.
It's like /r/wallstreetbets became country, lot hummus Deep cut.  Extrapolating US rate vaccination past week, would take year vaccinate entire population. illustrate important rates climb 2, 3, 4 million per day.

If consider eligible population (~250m estimate), would take Oct 29.

I’m trying negative, I’m excited see numbers progressively shift sooner things pick up. unrealistically pessimistic scenarios. Barely inconvenience. Could thought regular flu. mild symptoms large amount asymptotic. Wouldn’t need everyone hunker fear getting plague boils otherwise put commission. Masks dehumanizing. makes zero sense force healthy people wear something signals ""Danger, unclean! Stay away!"" DUH believe count anyone died infected covid covid death regardless likelihood would died anyway someone extremely mild symptoms covid-19 advanced stage cancer gets counted covid death (or heart condition covid heart attack)

I don’t think true. COVID causes heart issues, patients heart attacks least sometimes counted COVID deaths COVID caused/accelerated heart attack. someone gets hit car also COVID, wouldn’t counted COVID death. 33 close contacts school single day last week new Year 9 would moving class class form class. help Mexico populist foolfor president completely anti-mask &amp; constantly traveling around country. first press conference contracting Covid, insisted wearing mask doctors told can't infect anyone. Aye, girlfriend mental health, got scheduled health care provider past week. cancelled last-minute rescheduled March. :( can't teach, saying goes. NOPE palestine  iirc, US one top nations terms % population vaccinated. Well yeah one’s way me! Looking comments it’s embarrassing many people spewing defending blatant CCP propaganda. are, genuinely hope you’re part sort 50 cent army, gullible. Worth mentioning flu tests notoriously inaccurate. 30-50% false negative rate, honestly could flu. NZ started vaccinating manufacturers prioritised countries outbreaks despite getting orders early. Australia position. may lying, significant immune responses definitely real seem pretty common vaccine data. rough spell second dose, 101+ fever, joint aches, gnarly headache. colleague autoimmune condition awful couple days first dose. Totally worth course, it’s important realistic things people know expect instead surprised feeling like something dangerous happening. mean, right. one communicating end game strategy right now, extraordinarily frustrating. going end everyone throwing collective hands air saying ""fuck it"" they're careful. say someone believes mask-up people offered vaccine. Teachers working butts off, still doesn’t make remote learning developmentally appropriate younger kids.

Some kids fine. not. I’m forgetting. certainly trending down, rate, even shift case graphs several weeks. ask china like cherry picking info dont understand could say that.. however waaay infectious, dangerous. small fire less dangerous large one, small one spreads quickly.. think  not, reasonable protect elderly risk. vaccinated safe young healthy people even sick may even vaccinated well wear masks? protecting? young healthy people coronavirus basically flu? Give already goal posts moving This. US vaccinating super quick, great, vaccinations properly ramping up; we're well-vaccinated, things open up. Wow, isolated incidents. proves everything ! ! !   kinda expected that, especially us dirty dirty americans. kind viruses spread quickly do. secured pre-purchase agreements access enough vaccines cover 4 times population, 4 different vaccines case work. manufacturers decide needs prioritised shipments countries outbreaks. NZ thus bottom list. one literally data back claim Brain cancer live ten minute drive border Washington, literally would go groceries, play sports, whole world there. Lockdown extremely painful border communities border families. kinda pathetic sub banned word ""d00m3r"". allowed call conspiracy theorists spreading disinformation. Schools close can’t staff due staff sick. exceptionally high risk situation lot people one room, particularly age group commonly spreads disease. want schools open remain so, teachers must priority vaccinate. think misleading, Trump Chinese Communist Party? like ""we send man moon"" level event.  Honestly, much politicizing this, anit mask... page, vaccines would celebrated hard core researchers would damn international heroes heroines.  

No taxes life! 

Instead, probably sometimes fear lives nut jobs there. Fuck that. Thanks taking time answer! Even though can't fully relate, seem like fully valid reasons. I'm guessing it'll hard find right balance next months/years. No. screen family.

I work health care. see 150-100 patients day. masks screening resulted zero work transmission Covid.

A lot us kind rolling eyes Covid petrified population. Rates going down. Masks work. you’re sick stay home get tested. Pretty easy. Ah, see. China doesn’t samples could show virus might December. samples available ones show Wuhan cluster December. It’s bad didn’t hang onto whatever collected 92 suspected Covid infections October November 2019 necessarily Wuhan. matter, masking sold protecting others, specifically elderly risk. group vaccinated (or offered vaccine) safe longer need younger healthy population mask. disrespect police even little - go bye bye! Well yes, zero Covid impossible point, I'm curious know believe initial 4 week lockdown ended countries literally 0 Covid?  Found grandparents Michigan able get first doses trouble getting appointments. relieved Israel owe limited vaccine supply population isn’t even country? countries expected book?

Please explain. want know. like countries, Israeli governments provides vaccine places adminstering vaccine within borders vaccine comes Biontech (which worked collaboration Pfizer Coronavirus vaccine). government works deals many vaccines Pfizer/Biontech they'd like secure delivered distribution Israel. Also, territory population distribution significantly different Canada’s. Coupled storage requirements Pfizer Moderna, makes much significant logistical challenge Canada compared countries, except maybe Russia. differences among mRNA vaccines, beyond part spike protein produce.

For sequence used Pfizer vaccine, here's codes order ([full CAP make sure RNA looks like regular mRNA
* known successful optimized 5’ untranslated region (UTR)
* codon optimized signal peptide send Spike protein right place (amino acids copied 100% original virus)
* codon optimized version original spike, two ‘Proline’ substitutions make sure protein appears right form
* known successful optimized 3’ untranslated region
* poly-A tail ‘linker’ there

So there's room changes. [next Moderna BioNTech/Pfizer vaccines use modified mRNA, although think don’t use exact modification. many ways, Moderna BioNTech vaccines alike. Sadly Moderna published RNA sequence vaccine, can’t compare directly.

In practise, see [the Pfizer/BioNTech, efficacy said reach 95%, Moderna reaches 94.1% AstraZeneca Moderna also reported 100% rate protection severe effects COVID-19. Pfizer, meanwhile, said 10 severe cases COVID-19 reported phase III trial – nine placebo group; one vaccine group.

The effectiveness 2 doses symptomatic COVID-19 pretty much same, sample small confidently say really difference regarding severe COVID-19. However, Moderna's vaccine significantly effective one dose (80.2% vs 52%), higher dosing could responsible well.

All all, expect difference percentage points effectiveness symptomatic COVID-19, perhaps wider one severe COVID-19 (and factors like duration protection, need several months data say). Especially ealier circulating strain less severe. I'd probably far conscientious future actions

In Good Place Chidi thinks gone Hell simple fact preferred drink almond milk rather regular milk. thinks simple choice condemned thousands poverty illness. running joke powers afterlife really care minor infraction contrast much bigger problem, indecisiveness, routinely pissed loved ones ultimately gets killed.

The secret life figuring actually ignore. Sounds callous really get one crack life far know. Prioritize you. dropping masks mandate anyway? functioning economy (well, functioning pandemic times) mask wearing? 

20 bus passengers still 20 bus tickets sold whether wear mask not. going shopping. Go Pfizer Moderna! /whoosh הכל בזכות ביבי wear pants go public places? Where’s $1400 check! /s Surprising downvotes comments. It’s almost like people unhappy government didn’t courage enact policies needed citizens didn’t fortitude go hard yards stop spread.

Happy downvoted oblivion cause I’m happy part solution spread problem.

Many Americans screaming stop steal trying stop spread. Due ignorance may making wrong assumption. 

I assumed new variant B.1.1.7 grows operates totally independent original strain, helped spread earlier versions. (or Virus (1.0) already mutating cross exposure? 2.0 Borg 2.0 1.0 mingle, longer separate path 1.0)

When look back, things late January March/April 2020 slow spread, including widespread wearing mask. 

“I assumed” lack defensive measures allowed Covid 1.0 grab foothold handful places across America, spread regionally it’s pace.

Now seems clear unprepared early 2020.

1.0 always going spreading every state regardless did, would soon branch hundreds hotspots across State.

By March 2021, CDC predicts COVID B.1.1.7 (or 2.0) become dominant strand America. Meaning even fully prepared, failed miserably stopping 2.0 spreading across America 1.0.

COVID 2.0 believed hit US late November. time 90% cutback sporting events, church meetings, office working reduction, significantly reduced air travel, reduced restaurant dinning, limited school attendance , gym attendance. concerts, conventions, etc...etc....All meant little far preventing COVID 2.0 quickly developing national footprint. 

I know precautions prevented larger case, hospitalizations death numbers. seems little effect stopping geographic spread.

The question:

Can draw conclusion ability slow coronavirus national exposure based fast 2.0 got 38 state? Israel relatively small population 8.6 million people, comparatively small area, put together solid vaccine rollout due part health care infrastructure willingness spend top dollar vaccines.

They providing Pfizer anonymous data vaccine effectiveness well. job one coworker said mild fever getting it. None rhe rest us bad reaction dose 1 2. must confess said coworker tendency get ""sick"" quite often, especially Mondays... Definitely! Please show statistics :) stop talking dude. already proven idea talking about. could earlier strain less side effects, different BIG one love now. less transmission got people rather wildfire. videos January 2020 people spitting doctors authorities Wuhan. thought meant yes right. Even lockdown different response previous leaks community. find similar one August coolstore whereas we've others didnt require change levels. Given learned UK varient taking extra precautuon one. Im hopeful short sharp get back it. fact none - there’s reason think different! Fuck masks. I’m going wear one regardless tells should. RemindMe! 6 months ""Most restrictions still place, goalposts moved again"" That's Biden promised. said wants million people day vaccinated, basically already happening. possible return safely 30-40 kids classroom, even 20 tight classrooms. schools extra classroom space put kids into. Schools extra staff watch them. want bare bones logistics social distancing shown me, far schools haven't. Kinda, also kinda opposite. Trump trying “tough china” shutting money even looked like went China relationships. recalling virologists/scientists Wuhan/China could pretend aid money providing china Administration cutting. shut fuck up, man. mask mandate federal buildings negligible. Trump already secured enough vaccine entire country months ago. Biden's plan 95% Trump's. Biden also promised crush COVID quickly seems like paying attention. completely false Spanish flu significantly higher mortality rate covid. mild. Stay home like. us can't take anymore. Worried Covid? make sure it! Simple that. stop covid pls.  
 
10/10 advice. like, die. Dumbass. could see restrictions largely packed 3-4 months keep seeing exponential reduction cases deaths like this

And I'm damn ready got first Moderna dose go back second next month least two countries able test samples taken December 2019 possible Covid patients, China, hasn’t found samples able test yet. seems like could change protocols sorts samples must taken infections present long health authorities must hang onto them. sounds like data China might missing might able find anything more, either samples never taken, taken time later discarded. Bro literal geneva convention states occupied territory needs healthcare provided occupying force. Lions ever decent team see we're gonna get pandemic half country gonna get vaccine

I think governments let get vaccine infect eachother get natural immunity point since kind people generally need treatment okay probably level. infectious yet causing cytokine storms yet, would likely chalk bad upper respiratory infection start wondering early pandemic. Ideally we'll get better data version study soon! saw joe rogan podcast w eric weinstein, get it. Americans try part, it’s also year patchwork rules vary state county.

On plus side, we’re almost there, everyone wants vaccine gotten one move back normal. sustain 2M/day J&amp;J vaccine releases, it’s matter months sounds horrifying. Covid bad, risk disease far better living totalitarian, genocidal dictatorship. going say “congrats fuck you” remembered isn’t r/wallstreetbets. Anyhow, congrats. No, coronavirus never change behaviour drastically Seeing hopsitals average country overwhelmed, removing 50% current hospitalizations means get close overwhelmed. Looking forward 100% restrictions removed April! Unless following science anymore. way could possibly happen goal posts move though, right? OH GOD, MEAN CHINA LIED??? CCP NEVER LIE, RACIST SAY DISHONEST!! QUICK, MODS!! BAN THIS! Anti ccp rhetoric shall tolerated!!!

MODS QUICK THERES ANTI CHINA SENTIMENT AIR. CHINA NEVER BAD!! 

PLEASE IM SHAKING RN CHINA NEVER LIES Let’s see long term effects vaccine Similarly, got really sick spring 2019. symptoms match know covid causes. started feeling sick Disneyland. sick quite while, 3 weeks probably. finally went urgent care know was. test flu(which came back negative) told get allergy pills. sick long mother though. felt ""sick"" roughly three weeks said. definitely 100 percent long time. think “don’t plan flying next couple years” —it gives impression even vaccine scared covid years come, that’s all, thread focused vaccines = flying traveling, etc. Managed get first Moderna shot last week. Almost 50 diabetes heart issues. fall Phase 1B Texas, though convince people call state rep. think are? ??? point despite dumb things like fire Melbourne's policy worked. Would worked US? knows, certainly countries botched response probably would done well using Australia's strategy; one deny good one. someone plz tell almost everyone Israel vaccine? doesn’t help eliminate “Jews greedy” stereotype. I’m questioning, bigot. melting pot world. politicians telling populace hoax wear masks. Overall shit show. saying everyone, country, horrible. paper, see below, compares viral loads “2,897 unvaccinated people 2,897 age- sex-matched people received first two doses Pfizer vaccine” finds 4x reduction viral load 1 U/Tfenrir link)

Not sure different study one mention. fact age sex match two groups seems like address concerns. Uncomfortable facts still facts, way beneficial change made. *It is*, mentality agree with.

I online survey took various consumption metrics outputs individual environmental impact. put things perspective led changing certain behaviors try environmentally friendly. beneficial learn information, like would also find beneficial learn information examples.

If want maintain ""ignorance bliss"" mentality, perfectly fine. personally, would like know impact actions improve behavior. know politicized US agree stupid know much matters. despite idiots US average rate mask-wearing higher global average averages south asia, europe latin america (source IHME) feel honesty Israel's reporting? Netanyahu piece shit, trump supporting, corrupt no-good-nick. 

Do think he'd doctor national numbers? Yep Dude shut hell up. Jesus. normal feel bad vaccine. appropriate immune response fever fever related symptoms, like inflammation fatigue, shortly vaccination. got second Friday day post-vaccine got 100, every joint ached felt fatigued. girlfriend got 101.8 felt worse immune response. expected proof functional immune system power science! way makes pretty much same.

But pretty much same. Different lipid coating dosing amounts, storage temps, dosing schedules meaningful differences. COVID hospitalizations 65 unfortunately it’s going take month two get risk population vaccinated getting married May 2022 hoping same. Biggest issue venue allowing dance floor weddings happening right now, signed May 2022 (on anniversary date) hopes types restrictions lifted then. Hopefully that’s case. Fingers crossed too! will. ate getting there. Cases going down. tons reasons optimistic!

 see reason rush, especially masks, far fewer societal costs. Let's spread misinformation. mRNA vaccines interact DNA way. get cells go ribosomes pumps millions spike proteins train immune system.

Once mRNA breaks like 15 minutes less, spike proteins remain. Large parts US back normal Australia (everything open, without ever-present threat new lockdown) fewer deaths per capita UK. 

I live one restrictive parts US would still take UK Australia day. sure anyone downvoting asking good question. Take upvote catch BMI scale needs adjusted ethnicity. Basically Asian people need much lower BMI score equal cardiometabolic risk 25 BMI white researchers discovered cardiometabolic risk factors white person BMI 25 appeared much lower BMIs patients groups: 22.9 African-Americans, 21.5 Hispanics, 20.9 Chinese 19.6 South Asians. controlling lifestyle factors smoking, alcohol intake, exercise diet, found 21 percent whites cardiometabolic risk factors normal BMIs, whereas 39 percent Hispanic-Americans 44 percent South Asians normal weight higher risk chronic diseases usually associated redditors hav short memory, China made research months ago, testing antibodies, authorities declared might 5 Times bigger confirmed cases, so?????????? even new. duly noted, correct. wonder explains reinfections?

It's simple. becoming increasingly clear vast, vast majority people got covid-19 point past 11 months practically immune reinfection, likely remain immune long time. would *very* conservatively estimate *at least* 90% (but almost certainly higher) people got covid-19 form lasting immunity.

This mean reinfections happen. reinfections rare, almost certainly something worry about. personal perspective, also herd immunity perspective. sound obvious, reinfection has, say, 5% percent chance happening, happen 1 20 times, unrealistic many people personally know someone got re-infected (note: suspect chance reinfection much lower that, used 5% easy visualize). 

The answer question reinfection binary. ""even covid-19 still going immune"", ""everyone immune"". answer like ""almost people immune"" (which close, quite ""everyone immune""; definitely significant difference two).

In words: virus behaves like viruses know of. would breath fresh air people stopped pretending ""alien planet"", speak, extraordinary properties compared viruses.

Look, people terrible numbers; especially percentages, large numbers, exponential growth, on. pandemic made painfully clear again. understand people see news items reinfections get impression something they, personally, worry about, huge problem general. almost certainly not. reinfection something happened significant minority (say, 20-30% people), would know now. indoor outdoor gatherings prohibited unless everyone attendance vaccinated. Masks required everywhere everyone US vaccinated (not counting refuse). Vaccinated people still spread CDC said continue wear masks. ok good know ty unfortunately, trying always mean succeed. i've struggling anxiety many years know full well need take action. do. sometimes, though, effort alone ain't enough. disagree point made, dude replied explained position satisfying way. access actually using two different things. Anyways. Sad thing good amount people need humility ones believe vaccines work. deaths start getting blamed biden biden takes heat stop ""Hot Taek"" altert! reply ""China Russia bad"" comment, whole family good percentage country vaccinated two. vaccines work, science behind sound side effects worth mentioning.

With said, comments seem show sort bias towards countries suggesting USA things properly, even try change opinion. Thinking USA ""kinda everything"" regarding vaccines untrue insulting everyone involved battle. people treat like already carrier immune? 

You catch Covid once, vaccine doesn’t prevent spreading others completely. majority population vaccinated keeping masks around responsible thing do.  don’t think common flu. longer sticks around, less intense get eventually start resembling common cold. Israel Palestine analogous US Mexico. perfect analogy either would closer US tribal lands. poor nations get it, unfortunately rich states get done first send whats left them. Put mask helping others. 100% study. unlikely scaled upto billions stay 100%. stay relatively close. great, thank you. 4x reduction viral load 1 dose great. look forward seeing results 2nd dose. election three months ago Hungary, dark horse EU everyone EU hates. Nothingburger.

For fuck's sake CNN. said people country X stupid I'd called bigot. apparently Americans fair game. I'm immune I'm carrier. wear mask? credibility Right election
Lol obvious what’s going mean people covid get vaccine experience negative side effects due pronounced immune response? Cases typically worse *per capita* areas less mask usage. Per capita matter.

 Here's study showing link masks reduced I'm seeing I. thread sounds like thinly veiled anti-mask sentiments. know want believe open interpretation opinion, reason face masks standard practice dealing respiratory illnesses literal decades. Great study long term side effects vaccine They've specifically said fomite transmission unlikely looking contact close colleagues airline staff.

I think issue aerosol transmission easy pindown either. Perhaps used particular corridor, toilet, whatever, straight someone else.

We previous central city case genetics said Person passed ot Person B, ever area ascertained. Well yes, less agree one reasonable / knowledgable claiming eradicate virus. But, lot people reasonable knowledgeable.

How many times heard things like ""if hard lockdown 4 weeks virus would go away would done this"" ""it's safe go back normal cases get zero"" ""we pursue zero-covid strategy""? utter nonsense people still say frequently sub.  I’m going bother even trying reason you. You’re coronavirus sub obviously troll. could stopped quickly like many countries, leaders refuse lead enforce safety measures happens. ""reals"" restrictions placed overwhelm hospitals, therefore remove restrictions second longer worry that. month 2 elderly risk vaccinated.
  
That's reals talking about, right? checking. anything less would based feels. Seriously, vaccine rollout amazing. days ago, UK total vaccinations entire EU, combined.

Just shows either good British program was, poor EUs was. state? high density extremely older population mean xenophobic? Again: hospitalisations deaths stubbornly high despite vaccinated nearly totality 55?
Something add results. PA part Israel.   confused nothing. Moderna complete study it, recognize trend. 38 million people recieved one doses + 14 million people recieved second doses = 52 million doses administered there's species jellyfish that's immortal

 Notorious tax avoiders well data actually extremely valuable world including america.

The issue getting vaccines Americans never money. bottle neck creating vaccines, we've thrown ton money point diminishing returns. Yes comment anything useful? Example:

Say 10,000 people unvaccinated - 1,000 symptomatic 100 people severe disease.

Now 10,000 people vaccinated, 60 symptomatic 8 severe disease.

Rates way obviously wrong COVID, picked easy round numbers unless I'm moron Vaccine Effectiveness right. asked would position know briefing December, Esper replied, “Yes. I’m aware that.” Okay answer question: Netanyahu nothing this. Yes Currently around 109,000,000 confirmed total COVID cases.

I think could argument number could closer 500,000,000 even 1 billion outright. think initial surges lot people got sick never tested testing infrastructure set yet.

So rough estimates say things start returning normal around fall 2021. could months earlier many people already sort immunity now. recent data transmission every party wearing mask? know there's general studies show mask mandates reduced numbers, strict mask wearing enforced indoor setting(ie grocery store one even tries get anti-maskers mask up)? sunk cost fallacy preventing escape. Okay hope feel better soon. concerned deaths Pfizer vaccine? realize compared amount people vaccinated deaths obviously much warrant panic, still, worried parents taking older category like ones passed hot take want thoughts on: massive drop hospitalizations deaths big increase vaccinations happening continue happen, COVID USA largely gone 2 months. 

Thoughts? way earlier say that? US third israel Seychelles number fully vaccinated. Either way, it’s bad place be. 

There always hiccups setbacks government bad action vaccination. We’re still well considering. UK UK production themselves? even allowed AstraZeneca make production problems EU plants.

The answer simple: there's vaccines UK, vaccines rest. ones rest managed standards.

Yet ones UK? That's different story right? yet 100k cases day. Wtf Hey anxiety disorder cured meant moreso done good job providing ""universal"" healthcare way make morons scream ""socialism"" due national insurance system set up. wasn’t catching misspelling. I’m saying aid misnomer. 

What money earmarked public. there’s internal corruption Israel, that’s they’re problem. They've got universal healthcare semi-private national insurers point. hope every fiber everyone thinks like wrong. No, saying tone article asinine. Many people living dystopia right now. wedding 100 person cap doesn’t compare people dealing with. Well coming country allow AstraZeneca move vaccines UK, literal export ban vaccines.

Why people complained that? think got covid man feel sick can’t taste can’t smell

I feel like dogshit 3 weeks ago. things look like 3 weeks? 6? stats since spring, folding two cheap Dells GTX 1060 1070 moved DC PA problems changing states health insurance. Either way, could contact HR see there’s restrictions plan. Kind hard compare country 9,000,000 330,000,000 Yeah couldn’t show sooner weld people inside houses oki still find hard square news reports fact UK South Africa seen cases falling steadily since early January. idea variants make virus harder control year ago, respond measures (formal informal) worked year ago, even though people staying home less were.

I know UK lockdown (though hit peak couple days lockdown began, that), variant continued spiral control even lockdown? 

I'm usually pessimistic fatalistic everything, get it.

Anyway moot, since people never going take many precautions cases falling they're rising. assume they're going mix mingle more, try step vaccinations, try proactive, work -- much based voluntary behavior. Good article failed address data indicated it’s 30% lethal. don’t understand people continue walk back study shows may possible. Yup. Hopefully they’ll reopen everything even still tens thousands cases per day amongst young. 50 million people ""barely anyone""? why? immune system target N protein would make difference whether learned infection vaccine?

Why can’t simple?! NY system divided confusing state, county cities vaccination programs talking other. go state site shows state sites county sites way around. find convenient site available slots likely check 2 5 different sites. people driving 4 hrs get site closer one available nearer run different level government. also people giving checking state site thinking available knowing available. post would appropriate r/COVIDProjects hangover pill would sweet 20’s! Covid big deal, widespread ban in-person socializing well shutting large sectors economy *an even bigger deal*.

It’s possible lockdown skeptic think reopen everything without thinking covid “just big deal”. clearly understand difference positivity RATE number cases. I’d assume 52 millions would mean total injections(because person needs two doses vaccine). data says 38 mill gotten least one dose, extra 14 million would mean 14 million gotten two doses Go back sleep vaccines accelerated social end. people know vaccine months available all. get mine risk vaccinated, I'm *totally* done. needs stop. money public misspell something fine. need try twist fact US included billions dollars last stimulus Israel fact US gives money country US ask cooperation access data return. thousand variants start raising alarm bells every time find new one people going tune out. different original. point know good amount mutations scary would feel like would best comment variants find particular mutations. nothing *wrong* reporting though guess Gotcha, thanks. That’s exterior. People act prickly, generally pretty nice unless army doctors case morons assholes. am! Sometimes
Lol South Carolina travel possible far Virginia Florida sounds like many exposed COVID prior first vaccine, ramped rate immune response via vaccine prevented progressing.  Itd like school fire drill time actual fire started wasnt large. point either stop fear isolation etc. completely break become basically emotionally dead well stop caring.

I approaching latter fast. mist depressed dead inside ever life continues much longer, point living. EU’s decision implement export controls coronavirus vaccines “highly problematic,” according experts. Yes, let's forget there's export ban vaccines US. Basically they're getting vaccines made Europe.

So that's true, they're taking care themselves, EU, Índia, China Russia export vaccines global scale.

That's get comparisons, UK USA exports bans, compared rest? Like, vaccine nationalism immunizes countries faster others, shit. planning force it? view least incentivize it. 1400 cash vaccine would save many lives. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Vaccinations scaling up, vaccinations scale significantly, work put federal government yield fruit especially supply becomes available. Positivity rate way too. haven’t seen Colorado. Tolls private highways lanes expensive nobody uses them. feel you. Read room, NZ. Better start studying Chinese. United States stopped ""in together"" Summer major news organizations spent Spring insisting everyone needed cooperate decided protestors aligning political views need wear masks stand six feet apart. know lot people adamant justified ignore restrictions protest happened, that's majority Americans decided care restrictions anymore.

You cannot tell people they're monsters follow rules, say following rules makes heroes, spend entire Summer praising people breaking rules expect everyone consider valid. literally matter protests we're talking health consequences, viral particles know signs say.

Hey, I'd really interested seeing contract, always interesting, contracts tend secretive, reason AZ/EU contract got published sides started making claims it, got high stakes political. right? Dunno, ultimately, think feel to. would difficult worse AZ/EU one.

The contract English Law bind states. binds AZ, said, one's willing break UK contract. I've reason doubt contract say give UK first 100 million doses. 

And AZ tried ignore contract, I'd imagine UK government would go court get injunction force performance contract. half decent contract, we'd go say - hey, claim also, contract rubbish, promises nothing. third states similar policy based interpretation federal guidance.

There's nothing either sources says states instituted policy NYS did.

There's much misinformation this. reality vast majority nursing home deaths happened well policy changed NYS covid deaths per capita nursing homes better states. Happy wear mask however long deem helpful. open bars restaurants remove curfews? That’s I’m saying. got fever times: 101, 102.6 second shot allergic reaction injection site arm swelled super painful. Better believe taking anti-inflammatory drugs. Actually, forced Oxford university join amateur AstraZeneca, instead cooperating Merck might bit professional like Pfizer. HMG demanded British company get shit together. UK put contract AZ first 100million produced UK would used UK.

So, seen contract? Contrary EU, UK publish UK hoarding vaccines every one used?

It uses capacities abroad get vaccines. Regarding fact biggest pandemic since acentury also countries, countries could tempted enact sovereignty imposing export limits even bans like UK ignore secret contract English law. Brits would UK also supplies EU ingredients vaccine production.

Actually not, facility Croda fortunately sits Alabama. Croda contract Pfizer argued, contracts must never broken. supply coming Michigan facility going United States first quarter 2021,” Gottlieb said interview CNBC.


Also, I’m saying US main reason Canada struggling. Canada played mostly investing European manufacturing US manufacturing. EU manufacturing lagging behind. worried Trump might ban vaccines leaving US. 


US manufacturing going amazingly great could’ve helped supply Canada. Canada decided trust Europe struggling help themselves. Totally agree general assessment. May, daily vaccination rate EU 4 5 times current rate. 16% 2-3 weeks impossible. Beginning April realistic, please create high expectations.

\-----------------------------

Only order show believe impossible (and fuel flames), calculation, using example Denmark:

Population 5.8M

16%=928k

Denmark stands 404k. 524k needed 2 3 weeks, 175k 262k per week.

For last 3 weeks following weekly numbers:

Week 4: 65k

Week 5: 62k

Week 6: 67k 100% WRONG

&amp;#x200B;

they bring outside air 

CONSTANTLY

the tanked oxygen solve problems, pressurization systems constantly pump fresh, outside air fuselage.** control interior pressure, allow old, stinky air exit, motorized door called **outflow valve** located near tail aircraft. It’s size briefcase located side bottom fuselage. Larger aircraft often two outflow valves. valves are automatically controlled aircraft’s pressurization system. higher pressure needed inside cabin, door closes. reduce cabin pressure, door slowly opens, allowing air escape. It’s one simplest systems aircraft. think point might track record comparable Fauci's even track record. never responsible public information affect hundreds millions lives you? you, hard yourselves. Yes, plenty mouth breathers US, every country them.

People like Fauci restore faith humanity. risked everything defend science, guy! surviving 4+ hours airplane without sip water pretty rough. usually I'm sleeping even transatlantic even wake feeling like I'm dried need quick water break! Many countries reached herd immunity 30-50% population infected. Others bit lower enough vaccinations get threshold warmer summer temperatures. many counties increasing numbers daily cases. 

The countries least impacted Covid, Taiwan, New Zealand, Vietnam, cautious reopening get majority people vaccinated. Yup - I’m trial. also getting crossover everyone get vaccine another round (or placebo).

I think one great potential variants. South Africa present little lower J&amp;J regular Covid. seem meaningful far actions. like going sanction US drop NATO anything like that. seem far interested treating Russia big bad playing right along US. 4000 deaths found. Source: live Ohio. kinda like reddit then.  mean guess depends mean over. meant virus going exist still end year. state country point know. 4 people +100k receive vaccine Oregon lot better promised 95% protection. Immunity line trotted every armchair detective single respected epidemeologist ever single peak year now.

You wrong, wrong spread bs, nonsense based wishful thinking.

This trough peak, bunch fools think think go gather spread yet another wave.  KF94 KN95. Good man keep AntiUK stuff doing, may suggest find friends enemies, brexit need bring masses together hate nothing. wait see combination flood doses fact many people desired vaccines early already gotten them. 100% relate. wish never wear pants public again. uncomfortable restrictive. South Africa due start official vaccination rollout end week. present decline driven public health measures, anything, vaccines. yet, anyway. Oh, ok. That's lot human guinea pigs!  I'd feel pretty safe negative test symptoms 7 days exposure.

I believe 7-8 days recommended time testing. Hospital infection main reason new infection cases Wuhan lockdown, quarantine. China, hospitals main cities usually crowded. early days even crowded people slightest symptoms. Imagine many people fever city 11M? That's field hospitals built testing organized communities avoid unnecessary hospital visits.

""Quarantine"" means one person per room, except special cases like infants need accompanied mothers. even turned AC prevent aerosol transmission. Usually close contacts (up 2 levels) quarantined. Others ""lockdown"", means strictly stay home occasionally go grocery PPE. Usually grocery delivered community travel long.

Field hospitals people tested positive. Among early cases, especially young, sudden deterioration observed lead bad outcome. debate among experts, eventually decided go way since make sure mild cases close monitoring. proven important, cities, IFR extremely low, since positive cases, even mild fever, hospitalized taken care best medical resources available. Thanks clarification. I'm interested enough look deeply would assumed Russia bit true. know Serbia?

I've always wanted visit Balkans definitely doable, especially J&amp;J vaccine cleared people eligible coming weeks. Interesting!  Yes people know experienced covid March 2020 received vaccine Feb 2021. 1st dose, strong ""flu-like"" side effects. seems interesting severe cases didn’t drop much symptomatic cases Might well lift international requirements then. think got wires crossed came getting and/or digesting bombardment information speculation getting novel coronavirus. remember reading, viruses like influenza common cold mutate often many variants vaccine flu cold feasible. Viruses like SARS, MERS, COVID-19 rapidly mutate point vaccine possible, although people get infected likely mutate, preventative measures important. vaccine SARS-like type virus researched prior COVID-19 priority demand SARS MERS contained, vaccine COVID-19 came quickly; existing research already billions funding thrown it. enough data yet sure. Indeed, big question whether prevent severe illness prevent normal disease. Maccabi study points way, really need actually read know. can't find anywhere! Like said, 52 million means 52 million total shots injected arms. 38 got first dose, 14 million received doses fully vaccinated. 38 + 14 = total, 52 million.

Problem IP, production raw materials. That's EU pressured BioNTech partner Sanofi European pharmaceutical companies, Pfizer alone reliable.

The EU something stop screwed, impose limits EU contracts back track, that's done - take companies European court force comply would take much time.

Yet power control borders, like USA UK doing.

Too many vaccines raw materials made Europe us fucked big pharma, make change minds. big pharma complaining media working, EU people fed shit aware they're fucked over. must missed mask plane pre-Covid. ;) Western nationalism . one west benith I’m going get drama you, COVID lingers air frankly doesn’t make difference whether it’s technically aerosolized  Nationlism bad .

Morons. Article without NYT paywall:

“As Americans anxiously watch spread coronavirus variants first identified Britain South Africa, scientists finding number new variants seem originated United States — many may pose kind extra-contagious threat.

In study posted Sunday, team researchers reported seven growing lineages coronavirus, spotted states across country. gained mutation exact spot genes.

“There’s clearly something going mutation,” said Jeremy Kamil, virologist Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center co-author new study.

It’s clear yet whether shared mutation makes variants contagious, appears gene influences virus enters human cells, scientists highly suspicious.

“I think there’s clear signature evolutionary benefit,” Dr. Kamil said.

It’s unusual different genetic lineages independently evolve direction. Charles Darwin recognized convergent evolution animals. Virologists found happens viruses, too. coronavirus branches new variants, researchers observing Darwin’s theory evolution action every day.

It’s difficult answer even basic questions prevalent new variants United States country sequences genomes less 1 percent coronavirus test samples. researchers found examples scattered across much country, can’t tell first arose.

It’s also hard say whether variants spreading contagious, reason, like holiday travel superspreader events.

Scientists say mutation could plausibly affect easily virus gets human cells. Jason McLellan, structural biologist University Texas Austin involved study, cautioned way coronavirus unleashes harpoons still fairly mysterious.

“It’s tough know substitutions doing,” said mutations. “It really needs followed additional experimental data.” It’s blatant though. fact goes virtually unchallenged shows there’s likely China bots not. downvoted people stopped living reality. Maybe folks may think peasant remark unfounded, someone state government think so, opening centers underserved communities. Sorry say bit scandal going rich people highly populated areas traveling less populated areas get vaccine. internet info, story covered new York Times. Sputnik’s results weren’t bad that’s option would take it. ""supply issues"" result misguided policies last year: underfunded government procurement effort coupled ban vaccine purchases private insurers. taking limited supply given, possible make supply go “first doses first” approach — is, prioritizing first doses delaying second shot three four weeks (the period studied clinical trials) 12 weeks — would allow people get vaccinated quickly, example. “Fractional” dosing, giving half-doses, would instantly increase vaccine supply used successfully previous epidemics. And, course, authorize vaccines, including Johnson &amp; Johnson’s AstraZeneca’s (despite one disappointing trial latter South Africa), Novavax vaccine. take closer look Sputnik, Russian formula, shown strong results clinical trials. Finally, get shots arms could ease prioritization rules, streamline mean months CCP denying human human transmission whistleblower (who’s missing) let world know. 

Winner, China Every country bought doses regardless success clinical trials results, understand trying say. EU also upfronted money, like many countries. EU also funded vaccine development.

Man EU pulled AstraZeneca breached contract, hopefully sued.  people demand consider absurd level safety. would rather things open people choice: want “stay safe” isolate mask disinfect, prefer freedom get lives back. Right we’re held hostage. may work you, it’s depressing dystopian hell me. provides enough protection covid spreading like crazy serious damage maybe enough stop mild symptoms. new leadership helps, trump lost interest covid last June. clearly didn’t understand them. US #3 world fully vaccinated people PER CAPITA. country? good news! Cold weather may helping, one going outside, Midwest sever cold weather snap. Vaccines helping too. see. herd immunity people, want eradication natural infection?

Yeah mean there's lot weirdos, I'm going point I'm making argument, since least one power believes eradication. suspect albeit might wrong don’t testing capacity test people regularly asymptomatic cases like clinical trials. testing people come suspecting covid cause symptoms maybe exposed. leader country control ties national health press relations? Lol... again, requires knowing strains going circulate mutations going occur. Scientists psychics.

Comparing flu coronavirus (or even respiratory viruses) apples oranges. Even taking recent SARS-CoV-2 mutations consideration, pandemic coronaviruses (SARS, MERS, SARS-CoV-2) highly conserved. That's simply true flu. 

Yes, might possible create pan-coronavirus vaccine, given sequence conservation different strains. assume could case respiratory viruses simply myopic. Interesting. hope recovered quickly. asymptomatic part? claim mRNA vaccines least mostly protective month 1st shot. knows... I've provided multiple sources.

Maybe time people started putting shutting up. Again, objectively BAD leader, healthy question validity data output asked censored/doctored read favorably leader's performance. 

I know say joking, nothing Jewish religion.  Uh EU one largest trade blocks world, borders, exporting fuck ton vaccines - one largest, largest, vaccine exporter.

USA, UK received vaccines made EU. Israel received vaccines made EU.

Basically EU seeing contracts filled place, vaccines moving EU EU contracts seem falling behind. goddamn right better push pharmaceutical balls export control get shit together start fulfill what's contracts.

It's like 3 contracts matter, USA, Israel UK. fulfill contracts signed them. Atleast ban users delete comments echo chamber approve them. . 

Your username tells . Good see proudly applying badge . Oh man reminds people found jewish high school, heard enough conspiracies! know it’s Sunday Worldometer posted fewer 65,000 cases US today. That’s fucking awesome. cancelled weddings funerals too. keep telling grandmother stand outside hospital hopes someone eventually pity invite inside vaccine lol Many predictions don’t. He’s Ding’s level ain’t great get good idea reveals republicans question simply would never impeach republican president. It’ll banned, it’S ArOuNd YoU” they’re lithium* studies coming suggest otherwise okay. vaccines going problems South Africa variant look things. think good job variants including Brazilian one. new study confirms well Despite media pushed. die respiratory illness contracting 85 age group accounts ~1/3 deaths makes 2% population.  r/lostredditors Atlanta creates Covid superspreader event! Read friends. agree getting fucked contracts move turn around screw contracts help. companies need release IPs. it, recoup potential profit lost booster variation shots.   Well know, us Joos man space lasers need vaccinated that. that, world domination!!!!! happened aunt works hospital. finally received first shot (three weeks ago) started side effects past 24 hours shot. lost sense smell couple days later. mom urged get checked positive. took recover surprisingly bit harder time covid would expected given pretty healthy, think bad timing. hope parents feel better speedy recovery. aunt could picked covid anywhere though, work hospital tbh never socially distanced all. finally went back work last week might coming time second dose soon. Israel. can’t believe people even debating this. Israel given 3 times many vaccine jabs UK per capita. It’s close. Israel obviously going first country vaccinate every adult wants vaccine. Pfizer said tested vaccine works variants. Moderna too. vaccines seem effective variants though. Lol people thread specific, small group people trying push selfish narrative people take absolutely basic precautions ensure people safe. give provocation fear-mongering US reverting ""new normal"", even though epidemiologists clearly pushing cases lower enough low enough amount spread monitor little hospitalizations deaths virus.

I understand frustration, stoop level okay deaths others. keep informing people good masking, social distancing, isolating necessary terms saving lives getting us quickly possible. Keep good fight. people links India matter ? problem EU counting global movement vaccines, orders would managed pharmaceutical companies, imposed government contracts executive orders.

Who would thought vaccines made UK would UK supply only? AstraZeneca placed contract vaccines made two UK plants would used EU production, they're allowed move UK?

If clearer beginning, AstraZeneca pieces shit overlaped contracts, I'm pretty sure EU would demanded different things, specially movement vaccines EU.

But wanted play ""lead example"" card, see Trump issue executive order banning vaccine exports AZ claiming can't move vaccines UK due contract UK.

EU naive, reality EU fucked hard AstraZeneca, can't count USA UK. Secret Jewish Space Lazers used. Come Narendra, guys even play Cricket. Well, well :D

Indians passionate hysterical cricket, engage Cricket whatever wish ;) 2million+ vaccines day pretty fucking good. climbing daily. Literally Google Yes first 12/22 1/12 (Pfizer) doubt country gets 90% vaccinated. many people don’t want matter country in. Luckily, don’t need 90% adults vaccinated things return normal.  Haha, obviously never seen Chinese interact police.  specific, I've heard friends medicine death might attributable covid person infected counted. need direct pathological link. 

In case I'm sure deaths general population covid related methodology almost certain deaths would happened anyway causes counted covid.

I'm sure margin error acceptable, effect may multiplied studying vaccinated populations Indeed. variants running time. Dave Blake good mathematical breakdown this: different counties differently Texas? day two ago replied someone Texas 40 said received vaccine weeks ago overweight. Curious hear people’s opinion here. hanging inside 5 people last Sunday one tested positive Friday (rapid test) experiencing symptoms Friday morning. far 4 people tested negative rapid tests Friday Today. None us experiencing symptoms got pcr tests last two days waiting results. took two pcr tests Saturday Sunday need negative test go back work. thinking getting third test make sure wasn’t sick go back work. necessary. test negative two times 6 7 days exposure enough confidently say don’t virus right? Especially everyone else tests negative aren’t showing symptoms week later. Summarized another news new phase II study Moderna shows half-doses (50 μg) appear good full doses (100 ug) generating correlates protection neutralizing antibodies.

Excerpt randomized, controlled phase 2 trial, SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate mRNA-1273, administered two-dose vaccination regimen 50 100 μg, exhibited robust immune responses acceptable safety profile healthy adults aged 18 years older. Local systemic adverse reactions mostly mild-to-moderate severity, ≤4 days median duration less commonly reported older compared younger adults. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike binding neutralizing antibodies induced doses mRNA-1273 within 28 days first vaccination, rose substantially peak titers 14 days second vaccination, exceeding levels convalescent sera COVID-19 patients. antibodies remained elevated last time point assessed 57 days. Neutralizing responses met criteria seroconversion within 28 days first vaccination majority participants, rates 100% observed 14 28 days second vaccination. formal statistical testing done, binding neutralizing antibody responses generally comparable participants received 100 μg mRNA-1273 50 μg dose time points across age groups. Overall, results randomized, placebo-controlled trial extend previous immunogenicity safety results mRNA-1273 phase 1 study expanded cohort including participants older 55 years age [16, [These data] confirm robust immune response generated 50 100 ug dose levels.

“As good as” may right wording given excerpt says “robust immune response,” perhaps administer smaller doses get people vaccinated faster. mild asymptomatic. Next. count America’s excess deaths besides confirmed death toll would imagine still reign supreme EU country right, bloc first takes care exports little bit. 

India country exported quantity. China may join soon, Sinovac shipped large numbers.

I defending attacking, merely stating fact EU locked export controls threatened vaccine makers publicly.  two doeses mRNA vaccine? Well obviously #notmedical advice.

The data scarce answer exact question. However, would say prognosis still better didn’t vaccine. Anecdotally, outbreak nursing home right people getting vaccine. Almost everyone got Covid one died people went hospital. 

A Covid infection race virus immune system. Even slight head start give body edge. Plus, level immunity resisted get infection much higher level get seriously sick infection.

Anyways, best luck. lol. Oh can. choose I'm giving making facts demanding people prove wrong talking South Australia lockdown caused thought dealing super infectious variant. contact traced one guy pizza shop infectious person working making pizzas. guy claimed bought pizza meaning transmitted box. contact tracer smelled bullshit reinterviewed guy got admit he'd worked two shifts shop. meant normal close contact transmission ended lockdown early. barbaric letting hundreds thousands countrymen die like UK US?

""Letting"". also ignoring fact one knows China's true COVID numbers, especially considering fact case death curves seen anywhere else world country entire world deal 2nd/3rd wave infections. Even isolated island nations like Australia, Taiwan, NZ dealt outbreaks. China clearly hiding data.  sure soon

*narrator voice*: soon Shocker. I'd still argue count babies *might* born fatalities. Primarily idea many, they'd belong to, whether they'd made it, forth. 

It's like trying count money might received never did. ""lose money"" never it. Alternatively: 

Imagine work commission, go house-to-house various maintenance. make minimum salary, bulk commissions. 

Now imagine one month 20% less jobs do. specific thing took houses away, nothing stopped people wanting come, chose various reasons. ""lose"" money, make much hoped. 

COVID-19 specifically killing 20% babies, people avoiding so. babies easily accountable reasons born, death, they're fatalities. count chickens hatch jazz. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Crazy VAERS reports 600+ deaths US thousands severe adverse reactions. general statement many cases covid covid deaths reported within weeks vacinating half nation concern. virus 99.97 % survivable makes say ""Thanks man stairs got mine, elderly people got theirs"". Respect Bravery dead replaced self righteous cowardice. 'the article' says prefer article ""a corrupt incompetent"" government? even think write? Trump/Brexit crowd thinks total bull shit give year life. Agree not..I know. vaccinated allow travel I'm still young enough enjoy myself, happily stabbed. exactly US doing. mean sense implying actually understand works, given purchasing Covid vaccines plan, switch production capacity instead (partly) rely purchase standard vaccines? Surely another country countries could furnish vaccines. hate say it, true. changes made vaccination orders, deliveries, roll plan.

I happy see new administration taken office anyone, pure spin. others throats, spent summer shelving pingas sea tens thousands people world's best DJs. Yes. 50 million doses administered far US. lol.

They can't support stance stance. lot nice people sub never want talk pandemic lockdowns ever things settle down. Man, reading old Daily Discussion threads crazy. almost year since started, 5 days year daily discussion threads.

Looking back, didnt know anything virus, everyone assumed would 6 months.

March 13(day US changed): 21(first daily discussion thread): Couldn’t make policy something like “either fully vaccinated wear mask”? That's right, 2 countries totally different response similar outcomes. 95% efficacy Pfizer Moderna data plus fact took 3 days create initial version vaccines. tells rapidly adapted novel virus including flu, far better current shitty flu vaccine available today. I’ve invested half portfolio Moderna Pfizer based belief alone. keep waiting learn google Except people Manaus poor take packet buses live tiny houses many people unfortunately easy believe virus spread fast hope correct. Still waiting source. Well have. people realize SARS virus? told anyone 10 years ago SARS come back frequent flu, would imagine end humanity. Moreso hate idea vaccinate yearly hope people catch it, people still catch flu kills lot is, COVID could mean lot seasonal deaths. feels like whole world tried nothing gave up. That's whole ""well live it"" frustrating. People partying spreading COVID mutating. might gotten vaccines many people bought propaganda. latest mutations suggest got deadly, makes us think it'll get better? Also hardly anyone catches small pox, anything mmr, polio, etc, we've gotten before, unreasonable expect get point vaccinate regularly otherwise never think it.

To fair, eradicate really strong too, hardly anything eradicated, worry things like small pox. can't eradicate COVID could always lay dormant animal populations can't see can't everything point. right - I’m hip w wearing mask sick can’t stay home. tho  There’s lot money making everyone stay home order stuff Amazon big companies, watching TV news streaming video day. Meanwhile, NZ gets three cases goes back lockdown. SMH Trump: actively hampers govt response virus. Refuses wear mask discourages others wearing them.

Biden: Actually encourages others wear masks. Mandates mask wearing federal property. Puts full resources assuring vaccine delivered quickly.

Gee wonder coverage one favorable? 🤔 dangerous equate cells could become humans lives actually lost. politics aside, dangerous way frame statistic say children born (due covid, reason) casualty. end polarizing data end situations like people getting murdered miscarriage.

It's fact say birth rate dropped 20%
It's fact 20% people died could lived. Take back. Take back *right now.* like one most. comment backhanded/ sarcastic, agree 100%. בסדר אז Thanks full text. wish article actually said amino acid mutation in... state said they’ll probably get opening 1C (the group people 16-64 high risk medical conditions) May I’ve got countdown phone set May 20. There’s less 100 days left now! Although I’m still crossing fingers get sooner fly across country visit specialist early April I’m really looking forward getting plane near Easter... Agreed. vaccinating like crazy; catch Spring/Summer, borders 100% open back us. thx  painful. Whatever, readers got already. need work, feel like anymore. think I'm wrong want. wait see? Really? Exactly makes believe that? feeling? DATA?

I know mRNA works. fact, postdoctoral advisor one scientists developed technology. Yes, much plug-and-play platform quickly adapted different vaccine candidates, guarantee every mRNA vaccine work. people suggest get n95s? places go grocery pharmacy (cvs Walgreens) haven’t seen single n95. commenters saying Costco don’t Costco membership Fair point. think J J gets rolling we’ll really see speed I've playing Plague, Inc, since kicked up. Weirdly cathartic, also morbid suppose. 

Not one buggers want go simulation route. promise. greatly enjoyed delaying symptoms basically ""EVERY SINGLE SYMPTOM TIME! ::disco party::"" predicted. mean there's shortage? That's still true. 

Just we're far better countries mean things perfect. Vaccine eugenics though essence science denial shutting people asking legitimate reasonable questions raising questions might undermine pre-determined binary outcome (e.g. “pro mask” “anti mask.” actual science shows mask effectiveness varies widely depending various factors).

That ain’t pro-science. Science rational inquiry. you’re right; shutting rational inquiry indeed toxic society. don’t. Right manufacturing distribution critical.Nobody denying America credit used cheap vaccine developed Oxford America.
Pfizer developed German biotech company,Only Moderna developed US. We're relatively great, vaccines need still problem. could could done much faster case. said choose younger older person dying choose old person. either/or. choose old people die choose die.  Bartenders? definitely depends state. Mine sucks can't find vaccine anywhere. states smooth rollout. hit miss. saw things like too, can't remember anything really precise now. 

It's interesting (and guess bit ominous, do?) think much information passes front us every day seems banal unimportant time, take considerable significance later. obviously people think China doctor super smart human tell difference covid-19 vs normal flu less 100-1000 cases. Thats like less 0.001% 0.01% 11M population Wuhan. didnt think Wuhan probably many flu cases every year. 

If leader would call citywide pandemic lockdown less 0.01% strange unknown flu cases? find hilarious, people accusing China couldnt sooner. Like soon? 50 cases? assuming even proper test kit back 2019. know. part fear never end. Certain people *celebrating* idea ""masks going away anytime soon."" Man I've feeling optimistic outdoor wedding June lately, fiance FMIL really pushing everyone wear masks times day of.

Vitamin C reduced time 50% reduction symptoms approximately one day. 

""Patients received usual care without supplementation achieved 50% reduction symptoms mean (SD) 6.7 (4.4) days compared 5.5 (3.7) days ascorbic acid group...""

I surprised see generous dose vitamin C; however, understanding absorb higher percentage dose dose smaller, 1000mg less. 

""8000 mg ascorbic acid (to divided 2-3 times per day meals), (2) 50 mg zinc gluconate bedtime""

Regarding zinc study authors wrote, 

"" addition, studies SARS, coronavirus, shown zinc inhibit ribonucleic acid However, biologic activity zinc viruses may require ionophores, pyrithione, block viral ""

My understanding RNA polymerase needed virus replicate, zinc inhibits it. However need get higher normal amounts zinc cells. requires substance called ""zinc ionophore.""

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Small sample size.  need go phase three larger scale like clinical trials done. obvious paid chinese commenter cant call hard compare two, JnJ different conditions trials:- country resistant variant dominant (SA) another slightly resistant variant dominant (UK), whereas mRNA trials happened variants wide circulation- different definitions constituted mild/moderate/severe disease, endpoints going look different regardless- one dose vs two

JnJ 72 percent effective US, definition mild disease \*only\* one symptom + positive PCR. Moderate 2 symptoms + positive PCR (so headache fever, would automatically make moderate case, despite fact us would consider still mild).

I would take JnJ vs Moderna Pfizer month now, question, given \*all\* prevented severe disease hospitalizations trials. get boosted later anyways. really care much getting truly mild case. 


Of course, academic, 1) get choose, least long 2) US, much likely get Moderna Pfizer anyways within next months JnJ supply ramp considerably. parents got second shot 3 weeks ago. hugged first time year today, birthday! realize worried I'd whole year almost cried relief getting shots. hope parents get vaccine quickly stay healthy! look worst hit countries COVID there's common traits among them: large percentage seniors (65+) and/or large number obese/diabetics.

Older populations correlated development. specific case terrible developed nations getting first rounds vaccines first. I'm saying country bad yet start vaccinating general population. Generally speaking accurate. Though recent game started Scandinavia ended Greenland within weeks. shocked. 

The fact that, run, ended Madagascar I'd hit even 50% world coverage? knew I'd already. watched TV popped bubbles over. gripping games, kind genuinely nice (considering playing heightened difficulty, *easy* lot *easier* could been). Thanks! Yeah, figures. I'm taking either considered. I've bad viruses pain life, survive days vaccine response. Yuck. pleasant though... saved money know this, I'll pass along. That's trying tell them, seem dubious it'll people vaccinated June. managed convince table mask discussion later. idk bummed out. US vaccinating 2.2 million per day now, probably hit 3m daily March. They're going done like three months. gangrenous fuck high-quality fake vaccine? words even make sense together. Yeah don’t really know people expecting Two weeks ago closed Perth 5 days due single case, first since April. Clubs opened midnight weekend, people seated masks counting midnight standing dancing quite sight socials... Sounds like support lockdowns then. *And can't teach, teach gym.*

To honest though, teachers deserve top priority they're basically babysitters schools kids run around spread germs. Many teachers flat scared blame them. that's figured. I've seen people throw conspiracy theory I've never seen anyone back kind evidence. Apologies, top level comment used term ""casualties"" misread. That's responding to. 

To rephrase correct wording: 

""I would argue babies never conceived literally thought casualties."" thousand citizens knew risk should’ve returned earlier small price pay returning normalcy. Thank you! big concern left pandemic, Dr. Blake's resolved fairly adequately. I'm optimistic April everything afterwards. thank waking re-read article makes total sense. swear older get dumber feel. Thanks 130 countries enough senior population and/or obesity COVID terrible US. privilege allows US first vaccinating also reason one hardest hit countries. also support what's necessary keep ICU capacity high enough fair takes like 1-2 days pass law like that. take weeks countries 10 months ago. gonna miserable 3-6 months it?

Aha... can't blame EU that.

Says who? course blame clearly wrong call. US/UK quibble prices far better make money back reopening economies faster, EU made wrong call. Wasting time demanding ideal contract emergency idiotic EU pushed way queue it. false. 

To say population live fear government brutality wrong. average population fact trusts government much. you’ve done anything wrong plotting kill someone create trouble, government won’t come you.

If say, uighurs fear government brutality, yes that’s true case. anyone would downvote insane. Lol US started ordering vaccines March (300 million J&amp;J), orders companies April (Moderna) May (300M AZ). EU's first order looks 400 million doses June. Actually updated findings say seeing based additional data may 30% lethal, actually closer 70%. Sure, don’t know sure, direction data trending good. Chinese GDP 80 times US GDP?  shit. Taiwan warning since early 2019 jack shit! two possibilities:

1. vaccine effective mostly effective variants. likely possibility studies support this, least Pfizer/Moderna. scenario go back normal life quickly.
2. vaccines ineffective new variants. Unless mortality rate dramatically increases due mutations, scenario also go back normal life quickly can't live lock forever. 

Either way, going end year, likely summer number people give fuck quickly approaches 0. points process? 

I'm day 6 post Pfizer dose 1 I'm praying dry air causing vague cold symptoms. Stuffiness. consistent low grade temp entire time. I'm beyond paranoid caught covid know it, everyone's telling shot causing it, far it? hear people side effects day 3. 

Running humidifier, hoping helps. I'm usually sick winter long, year believe due masking distancing. probably normal February know it. 

To complicate things, autoimmune nightmare 🥴 get low grade temps pretty much daily. 

My anxiety let rest. super high risk already autoimmune stuff. 😫 Lol, I’m 64 hardly consider old. worry neither Covid vaccine.

I longer buy onlne there. youre pr reps. people forget. people crisis management now. people stabilize come back china. world knows saw. lot hate animosity them. know happened. people come tell truth censor them, says all. world knows china did. buzz away hyping up, make mistakes, even year later, people know come back china. make mistakes. 

sars slipped by, this. many deaths, many economies ruined. businesses bankrupt. mental health issues forced take vaccines. 

people never forget. chinas day come. downplay want. whole world saw know. many different channels/media groups/forum truth come spread. crisis management time things stabilize, light shined china. companies remove factories china. dont worry enough leaked info spread china. saw videos. 90,000 infected 4000 deaths, asz. dont mass build hospitals days deal 90000 infected. 450000 infected 6000 deaths hospitals. Yup. I’m one them.

Ah yes, leading, top doctor United States, “stupid” little goblin. remember videos patients trying pull masks healthcare workers faces China. feel you. Cancelling living save lives gets old while. USA's obviously going export/donate excess vaccines clear almost everyone wants one one. going dump billion spare doses trash. stated seeing good reason take covid vaccine here, saying know heard higher percentage risk negative effects virus 70 reduce transmission, 
My post removed threatened ban disinformation, statements called ridiculous.
In regards first claim I'll happily admit cannot sure that. 
As claiming stop transmission, Dr Fauci clearly stated interview heard today ""the vaccine protects effects virus, stop transmission"" 
Mods, please fact check calling claims ridiculous, claims incorrect better leave disproved allowing others may also hold beliefs educated. Exactly. Lockdown skeptic equate Covid denier. Florida's multiple lockdowns prevent hospitals going capacity. millions prediction based lockdowns would lead hospitals capacity. work 211 big concern many older people. /s tag Makes sense. wish bean counters used logic tallying Covid deaths. Fauci reconfirmed April open season vaccine. follow restrictions people refuse get vaccinated. completely them.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Well people voluntarily quarantine government step in. People clearly dumb enough 500k death doesn’t even change behavior, clearly crisis crisis government need step people learn trade temporary freedom greater good. US people perfectly ok WW2, people also ok loss privacy 911. Yet facing something even deadlier WW2 people like “what freedumb”? see term ""fatalities"" used article, instead using ""not born"" accurate. Fatalities = alive dead due whatever cause. seem case described article. Therefore think reading objection ""moo"" reports people losing immunity time. keeps dragging, patients could round 2. mean say take booze car. meant alcohol related issues, like gun related issues, product cultural social outlooks behaviors. 

The mere presence alcohol not, itself, problem. state decides allow pick booze drive thru, presence booze that's problem. social cultural outlooks may may end making problem. 

All told, I'm inclined agree extent. need randomly start forcing people different people booze cars *might* drink chose. I'm saying issue booze *could* drink car. chose completely different issue (and likely one they'd end regardless law). 

It's low priority issue, like legal system exactly known good triage. Stuff tends go comes in, little stuff best moved fast big stuff time ends floor. Good thing never mentioned anything restrictions... I'd hate one denial.

The 'population large' pretty much continue always has. Going along get along. However, agree growing percentage people tolerate another year restrictions. New Zealand’s approach seems imply think eliminating virus possible. I'd guess pantry meets conditions perfectly. jurisdiction live incredibly politically homogeneous. going difficult pull masks = (D) = good / ending mask mandates = (R) = evil framework long time come. probably right US fear region living really looking new normal.  factually false. proven longer wait provide higher immunity. news seeing vaccination shortage Philippines know gonna get lmao Eh, great terrible. Rec 4. It’s here. parents got day fine. safe. exhibit symptoms viral load body significantly reduced, think we're splitting hairs

How splitting hairs? know asymptomatic people transmit virus easily. share links showing lower viral loads vaccinated. Problem people get symptoms socialise more, probably counteracts benefits lower viral loads.


Until good evidence vaccines prevent transmission real world, splitting hairs. Viable month room Reddit USA based rather obvious Americans concerned ethics. totally lacking cash resources vaccinate people

This entirely true IMO. enough vaccine production capacity serve entire world time. EU export restrictions. 

You spreading fabricated information lies. 

The export restrictions setup UK US. said 92, presented team, emerge clusters ...

As presented by... Chinese government. saw CCP wanted see. shills bots complain impossible China vindicate judged like this, that's true, China allow timely open investigation. must known would look obstructed investigation year, went ahead anyway. guess why. negative votes nothing prove point China petulant child malevolent? Pick one. ...kissing-ass, big-time !!?? 👳‍♂️👳‍♂️👳‍♂️ yes, Germany also adopted ""America First"" mindset forced German company work together European pharmaceutical company instead?

That entire point. work together share knowledge, progress also vaccines...

The vaccine way important old people young people... make sure, countries without large pharmaceutical companies vaccinate older population first? Covid kill young people much died may mistaken causes. Also mutation called D614G started pandemic west original strain. Biden said year healthcare workers, general public. hospitals require masks rest year pretty realistic. said, joined effort. giving Pfizer credit? ""You think abuse home bad? abusive homes even phone call 911?"" Yeah really help me. think bit misunderstanding nature technological innovation. Kariko holds couple patents 10,000 patents relating mRNA technology worldwide. Go read NZ Singapore news. give regular updates cases. days zero new community cases. days imported.

Are claiming NZ Singapore lying? I'm curious broad limited affect is?

For example, seem lost/altered flavoring specific drink mix, everything else seems fine. I've even different brand flavor taste fine

What I'm getting significant number people experiencing loss taste/smell, typical depth loss? taste? something specific?  Neat. Every speck hope gets buried avalanche worse news.  Yep. Media won’t like covering things result end emergency culture. good ratings.    five fuckin days, that’s sure  trying justify export ban hidden behind virtue funding vaccine - something EU also did, part AstraZeneca, part BioNTech.

Selling vaccine cost AstraZeneca decision, trade getting vaccine game new plants new IP (yeah let's naive virtue signal again).

Basically settled deal EU can't fulfill part production control government - imagine XXI century private endeavors controlled governments. communism what? *shared* anyone. BioNTech engaged Pfizer manufacture vaccine relatively small medical research company ability manufacture required quantities. commercial arrangement.

As far know vaccine shared various manufacturers produced cost Oxford one. College professors evidence training virology touted experts. Anonymous social media users posed high-level intelligence officials. China Iran Russia United States, governments amplified claims motives.

The Associated Press collaborated Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab nine-month investigation identify people organizations behind viral misinformation origins coronavirus.

Their claims explosive. evidence weak. superspreaders. yup

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  You’re free choose. it’s realistic option people society whole. There’s point risk destroying entire society everything makes life worth living becomes worse damage Covid. Maybe we’re yet, point massively distant future. people living like tolerable assumption ends soon. probably slowed testing, largely given up. slow stop testing, rventually cases.    That's true, EU largest vaccine manufacturer developer. Many countries funded infrastructures, provided qualified workforce companies establish Europe anywhere else (yes, public education).

Even vaccines BioNTech received funds EU Germany, AstraZeneca.

And yes, EU pre pruchased vaccines like pretty much countries, that's UK innovation, that's vaccine procurement works.

Also private companies, country controlling production set limits companies fulfill obligations.

USA acting like old China banning exports hoarding private companies stock. UK slapped contract clause allow AstraZeneca move vaccines country. Pfizer's Belgian plant supplying EU, UK, Canada, Israel others. Moderna's Swiss plant supplying US mainly atm also supplying EU, UK Canada smaller amounts ramp up.

India using supply vaccine improve image worldwide. reason hear Europe talking fact supplying countries worldwide enough vaccines atm attempt EU try gain PR saying sending vaccines abroad would met anger within member states Countries like Africa sure. far know Britain, France, Japan, Italy require thing. Yeah get way - reality is, stop reading CNN. Coronavirus takes one thing: fear driving clicks horrible journalism.

BTW: don’t believe fake news conservative. hate CNN’s irresponsible journalism. saw pattern before. couple weeks lockdown restrictions, governors saw numbers decline immediate re-opened lime beaten.

1/4 nowhere close enough safely re-open. going prolong problem. UK Government funded development Oxford Vaccine signed deal Astrazeneca requirement produce cost (the one this) rest world could chance afford it. licensed produce billions factories around world notably India producing billion doses year alone mostly destined poorer countries. Plus second highest donator Covax US see UK considerably support vaccination effort around world. “US” vaccination program. state plan. Different phase definitions, resources, priorities budgets. much better others. live affects timing vaccination. countries Africa perhaps, places like France Britain Japan. I'd personally definitely take it. 

The reasons take South Africa variant. taking good idea, would need a) small study finding efficacy range -40% +60% replicated bigger data, b) SA variant overtaking area, c) reason able receive another vaccine booster, b happen. 

Personally, I'm country UK variant spreading now, stopping spread make difference normal summer no. AstraZeneca effective that. Pfizer shipments increasing fast enough summer, least early summer.

SA variant rare now, it'll quite dominant. (late summer/fall probably) lots mRNA vaccines studies work boosters. personal expectation received AZ, need additional protection SA variant, single dose mRNA could work, although that's pretty much guess. I've seen evidence taking AZ would permanently preclude taking another vaccine think case. can't watch another funeral stream loved one. Wouldn’t prudent literally stop running stories people?

Even it’s point misrepresentation information etc

Almost stories unintentionally introduce people ideology could cling to

If makes sense still virus. There’s still lot work done,” governor said. “But emergency behind us.”

""Mission Accomplished,"" Governor. I'm gonna put tinfoil hat moment, wager guess virus artificially created modified. Bio terror. Okay, tinfoil hat off. I’m Beijing don’t want lab leak idea get traction whatever reason, start discrediting narrative? Find evidence older spread cases. 

If I’m I’m presented cases found diverse areas earlier times... back tracking verifying people? China even allowing fact checking?

China willing direct narratives past. find whole thing bit sham.

Like I’m oil company spill get limit direct present info investigators... even investigation? US allowing private companies manage production stock fulfill contract obligations countries.

They're fault, hypocrisy. China, Russia, usually acts matters controlling private endeavors, exported vaccines US. hard since there's export ban US exported zero vaccines.

Canada receiving vaccines Europe, that's ridiculous is. say fully correct.

China home viral pandemics. historical fact. zero blame. avian highways bring many world's birds vast lakes China. viruses discovered China. originate there. birds brought them. remember Bird Flu.

Apparently, wants earliest sequences. surprise me, China first world country, earliest sequences easily available, preserved. Again, China's first encounter pandemic. second China's first world engagement. US, every major hospital pathology lab. operated, know (but friend manager large lab, information needed you, could post within 24-48 hours)./

I believe December mid late November already crisis wet market. Crisis meaning people dying quickly. Videos show people dying, dead. China amazing things. New hospitals overnight. Quarantine areas, etc. point.

You know talk virology lab near wet market. know story, true not, lab assistant removed infected bird sold wet market vendor. animal named guilty animal, fruit bat, people told eat it. Confusion, yes. along, China Tuva, China collecting samples, samples sequences. would irrational believe China disposed samples.

In mind, China needs share sequences related early samples. China Wuhan way modern information.

I unaware details seeks. disappointed believe leader dishonest truth describing probable outcome world exploding epidemic China. 

The call virologists around world China transparent became shout December. know viral epidemic means; means pandemic. Pandemic required infection China. acted horrifically rest world waited without going full defensive mode waiting say ""now"".

What's happening think cannot define sequences wants sign tissue samples. China responding saying, can't help you. disingenuous. world trust China. China's obligation poll records, looking November deaths Wuhan match know signatures COVID19. deaths, search pathology labs documentation possession samples.

WHO apparently claims 500. 

It surprising China produced report. sequences may valuable scholars world attempt deduce actually happened, epidemic broke prior warning, nothing. One day nothing, next day, explosion cases, many within week two. 

There alternative find earliest sequences see virus started humans.

China losing opportunity world leader here. China wants credibility. doubt team group functionaries. skilled virologists China. 

In closing, China, would want write book inception virus. would written history. career would guaranteed. 

At time, world suspicious. China make case, saying, know, sequences. human effort. Everyone wants get case #1, doubt get there, China help get very, close case.

Thank rational reply. UK export ban.

The UK-based Astrazenica facilities currently going full tilt, amounts somewhere bit north 2million doses week present. barely keeping domestic demand - capacity also assist EU's later order.

The UK spent lot money effort building complete domestic vaccine supply chain (ironically trust Trump rather EU). likely scope exports soon UK-based Novavax Valneva facilities ramp production. Thanks vaccinations, UK turning one safest places world. Exactly this. 

My mother shingles baby, 15 years later virus attacked pancreas caused type 1 diabetes. knows what’s Covid do. grandparents vaccinated two weeks second dose, yes go it! Otherwise, would prudent wait take precautions go (masking, distancing, meeting outdoors) compare neighbors?  UK allow AstraZeneca move vaccines UK, allow time soon. That's export ban, disguised ""contract obligations"", know, virtue signaling.

Basically allow private company manage production stock. Look 7 day trend daily cases UK. plummeting, UK longer risk zone matter weeks. No, no. can’t facts.

It people simply didn’t like Trump. Yes, must it. This. Good lord, Americans supposed compassion countries expense people? don’t deserve compassion, others?

We half million dead millions mangled.

I doubt America help vaccinate world stops bleeding home. think America “too selfish”, believe America help variety reasons including return normalcy international businesses.  glad starting research whether masks mandates conduce risk compensation. behavioral impact different interventions seriously understudied even though NPIs trying get people act certain way. 

[Risk compensation face mask mandates COVID-19 compensation face mask mandates COVID19 pandemic Abstract Face masks important component controlling COVID-19, policy orders wear masks common. However, behavioral responses seldom additive, exchanging one protective behavior another could undermine COVID-19 policy response. use SafeGraph smart device location data variation date US states counties issued face mask mandates set natural experiments investigate risk compensation behavior. **We compare time home number visits public locations face mask orders conditional multiple statistical controls. find face mask orders lead risk compensation behavior.** Americans subject mask orders spend 11–24 fewer minutes home average increase visits commercial locations—most notably restaurants, high-risk location. unclear would lead net increase decrease transmission. However, clear mask orders would important part economic recovery people otherwise overestimate risk visiting public places.  Let's forget orders came delivery times, order sizes. AZ came EU capacity figures, plants used, find can't deliver plants working properly ones were, UK, used fulfill orders.

This fuckery book. Basically AZ fucked EU commitment fulfilled, EU could doubled BioNTech force partner pharmaceutical companies Pfizer - weeks ago. Дело ваше.  people decide en masse stop wearing them. sense it’s really people, officials.  UK manufacturing Pfizer vaccine multiple sites too. right Ox/AZ one much easier manufacture large scales probably see increase. Makes sense. don’t see surfaces can’t contender here. 

Most humans stopped wiping surfaces, virus evolved exploit weakness defense. 

For anyone stopped hand washing careful around high touch surfaces... reconsider. TV stops talking Covid, presumably. folks second Pfizer dose last week 9th Feb. Yesterday, five days later, mom 100 Fahrenheit fever chills. took acetaminophen felt better night. Could delayed side effect? able find sourse indicating time line reactions. Thank Isn’t vaccination endgame? Same, shame guy deep echo chamber respect world renowned virologist. least trillion! partially agree... buuut explain ungodly peak first wave New York April last year? Italy? lot explain. teach person drive order get drivers license.

You teach persons immune system recognize eliminate virus, get vaccination certificate! still major proof that.

Sigh. Yes, do. anti-vaxx facebook group post something? Stop bringing stuff here. can't talk people phone then?  Fauci completely untrustworthy. done time time even admitted sometimes things tells public manipulate them, give straight truth. 

I guess prepare downvotes fact. masks early pandemic, estimates herd immunity percentage statements UK variant. wouldn’t call leading infectious disease expert country “baseless.” Think I’m gonna choose believe guy Reddit. idea people open space quarantine facilities already covid-19.

People cough test negative put room instead. 

I'm sure Slovakia mismanaged organisation somewhat fact countries would implement perfectly.

In perfect world countries would prepare ample quarantine facilities pandemic shortage rooms. dream farsightedness... Definitely getting some, world’s second handsome guy. Excellent, thank Covid ""airborne"" medical definition. 75% figure guess studies test people recovered vaccinated within 15-30 days signs protection. however studies showing someone recovered month ago protected. vaccinations. variants south africa brazil show far evasion protection natural infection vaccination. seems collector's quality group idiots region country represent. 

Dear anti-maskers, us favor move states refuse vaccinations. see survival smarter, implied Darwin, full action. wish ill, case hope karma whatever exists helps group cases covid people smart enough listen actual medical experts. Isn’t effective. It’s still effective, little less. Aaaaay chairitos 😂 patent product, exclusivity. ""product"" encompasses IP, clinical data, regulatory submissions/statuses, approvals, designations, trademarks, etc - that's what's jointly owned. patent means (probably) prevent others creating product without involved. Exactly! meaningful issue, enough production everyone (yet). can't distinguish a) series inputs makes given outcome likely b) attempt moralize excuse said outcome?

People likely shitty things work, lose access friends, stuck home already unhealthy environment. obvious selection We'll see comparable data countries soon enough, suppose. would imagine average age hospitalized people dropping significant, can't explain pointing hospitalizations dropping across board. God forbid moving vaccines USA. likely made obsolete variants. make booster it, we'll get screwed Brits again.

Which makes even questionable worthwhile European factories make could make Janssen instead. criticism plan. rationale based sheer numbers - 150,000 teachers, 760,000 seniors age 65. Last week state started vaccinating 80, week anyone 75 eligible. Teachers started getting vaccine last week January. tried late stage capitalism perhaps MLM? That’s totally sane rational reaction sub positive influence upvoting Shared interesting way saying completely funded put capitol risk. supply might issue. Put comma title. 800,000. Fuck sake. providing source quote, bearing anything, case someone wondering derived from. consider 3-4% “high”? didn’t see anything article - direct payment Fauci personally? would think/hope would donate “winnings” sort health org... right. need give landlord signed copy declaration (though need CDC's declaration, long appropriate information there).  know stack ""behind"" VT seem poorly terms getting doses allocated arms. %of allocation distributed higher Illinois. 20% state population 65+. Even VT vaccinated 0 healthcare workers, STILL enough 65+ another 5 weeks (if everyone 65+ wanted take it).

VT 2 factors open 65+ yet. 1. VT currently open category doses coming serve category. (VT cancel appointments need call around looking one, state website show appointments available near soon eligible) 2. uptake really high. Healthcare workers 90% ish uptake believe, 75+ believe 75%+ uptake. agree saying, that's OP saying. UK gave IP Oxford vaccine *for free* anyone could produce it, sell *at cost* (e.g. AZ India). Furthermore UK actually export ban, Aztrazeneca giving first 100 mil vaccines produced UK, UK. that, they'll distributed needed. That's contract, nothing export ban.  carries legal weight people wearing masks **right now** people wearing masks **right now**

From weather standpoint, cold heck, masks another way cover face. Three masks two scarves. Full burrito mode. Right, ok sacrificing 500k people freedom, get it. Yup, India made pandemic population enough infections achieve herd immunity. Probably around 50% warmer climate makes bit difficult spread. took one Advil 9 hours second dose completely miserable. fever 102.8, aches, chills. I'm pretty sure immune system already worked job. Hey, believe free wear want regard. want keep wearing masks, it. I'm going give problem. go trying lobby rest us oblige via executive order law.  see, can't distinguish causes moral justification reddit. allowed. Lol people hardly even give away AZ vaccines now, even 3rd world countries playing hot potato among other. Hopefully Pfizer Moderna ramp production quickly. would place lift mask mandates? barely 15% population vaccinated national perspective, many places still well 10% many places, good percentage vulnerable still vaccinated. state, populated counties barely 3% vaccinated, large number 75+ still can't get vaccine yet.

Wearing mask months kill anyone literally figuratively. wearing literally will. guess? again, hospitalizations dropping rapidly US too, without widespread vaccination want see juxtaposed countries see vaccine responsible not. begging vaccine Georgia couple months ""Governor"" pretty much told teachers go fuck themselves. Complete shame Friendly reminder Japan testing you’re basically half dead already. tested 6846 people Greater Tokyo area yesterday. 30 million people live there. 

Source testing data: Yessir paywall: Seems questionable. better option vaccinate elderly first schools virtual anyway? Kid also spiked fever next day.

Damn... must scary. Glad turned cold. Yeah, kind mafioso tactics employed EU well. apparently we're that. FDA reviewing right now. vaccine advisory board meet discuss findings review Feb. 26 People wearing N95 similar masks. eating drinking available short flights. heard people say ""going literally killing someone's grandma."" worth it, 3 times going many times. How? covax deliveries yet start. comfortable helps hide face. I'd wished could wear mask inside stores long time now, usually would kick wearing mask thought going rob place. Hopefully changes least allowed wear around flu allergy seasons. 

Is strange people? know tons people fell love masks continue wearing about. Definitely strict now, walking around stores parks - things like that. 

I've especially loved fitted KN95 go jogs winter. I'd never even thought wearing mask before, damn amazing keeping face warm preventing dreaded lung-freeze. graph weird potentially misleading Y-axis, I'll give that. understanding currently people vaccinated Israel seniors, Covid hospitalizations dropping dramatically cohort, would seem statistically significant, no? Jesus even Mexico dunking Canada.

Source:American living Canada. No. really updates No, going soon accounts. sure arguing with? NZ government they’ve stated explicitly, going zero always bridge vaccine better treatments.

See endgame: Landlords parasites. exploitive unethical. Fuck landlords. great side note, refer vaccine 'BioNTech'? Pfizer helping production. Hours recycled air time deep cleans turn around. could go wrong? don’t wait manageable level today.

You wait project stay manageable level even upward pressure transmission rates caused reopening.

Depending fast country’s vaccination program open now, could minor difference huge one. Thanks replying, indeed, heard friends Fall terms scheduled assumption covid well controlled. Hopefully vaccination programs ramp enough make happen hard say EU, China Russia also exporting vaccines?

All Pfizer vaccines going countries come EU, USA UK export ban vaccines. born US tax dollars went vaccine. course expect get vaccinated first. think Moderna developed? 

It developed NIH. think funds NIH funded vaccine? getting old people think vaccine poofed existence created vacuum. demand feel entitled results outcome. trying times unprecedented uncertainty, know people loaded mass graves society collapsing. We’re together. Come get tires changed. TLDR: Transmissions happen, despite multiple airline-funded studies say otherwise. mean? choose get vaccine they've chosen risk hospitalized. Even sub-herd immunity, sufficient vaccination natural immunity mean hospitals unlikely become overwhelmed COVID patients next winter. societal risk I'm fine people choosing make choices, even same. Well, fair, mostly give first shot vaccine. lot expert said could lead mutations. Yeah unfortunately would die covid-19 leaving world behind human rights violations place.

We talking ""world without human rights"" talking countries suspending one right months people would otherwise infect millions.

Remember, governments right start like New Zealand, Australia Taiwan, talking putting hundreds people quarantine save tens thousands lives.

Maybe ways protect vulnerable people yet see work country.

""ripping fabric society"" seriously, weeks quarantine, get it. think like prison, think like going camping rainy season electricity wifi, give comfort need adapt new environment still get use phone, video chat watch Netflix. think find unique perspective. great deal human communication comes facial language, component removed, person naturally feel cut off. Right, welcome maintain mask norms suits you, I'll ditching mine vaccination becomes generally available. Archived link: I'm gonna thank something happened even born, done earn that? I'm French way. I'm originally spaniard, country also helped US war independence got invaded century later US whose government wanted capture colonies. I'm sorry can't write someone holds simplistic views world, almost like talking 3 year old Descartes. tarpon fly high bucket list sure. Bonefish permit well. 

And yea keys before, Florida lot including recently. Wide open, restrictions all. someone explain friend formite transmission is? active planned studies know?

I fear window opportunity investigate closing vaccinated. Step shoes people allergies, diabetics, asthmatics, everyone else living incurable medical conditions could kill them, talk ""inconveniences"" goverment prioritizing political operators form party.

There, FTFY Vaccines already required lot things long time.

You needed go school well college. remember one ""forced"" get attending college.

Jobs also required them, especially ones hospitals require international travel.

Countries also required certain vaccines long time order travel them.

In short none new, likely notice got vaccines child already required ones. give free vaccine south asian country (accept Pakistan). Quite opposite, actually. Body language, facial expressions (particularly eyes, though tell people smiling mask moves bit), tone voice carry significant amount information. enough complete social interactions.

Do **you** issues reading social cues need every cue navigate social situations? main issue coming supply getting enough people get vaccine quickly enough. Iowa here. measure lifted last week. looks normal there...I hate going store now. hate break you, India produces 70% vaccines world, buddy. India's responsibility.

Trump good scapegoat, apparently Biden seem mind executive order... sad EU turn Russia China help, is.

I'm pretty sure reflect future deals. think whole Astrazeneca debacle people starting doubt trials. Consider Europe greenlit AZ 65s despite trials showing safe effective. People losing trust due media coverage politics It’s definitely possible vaccines aren’t 100% effective. still catch covid therefore still transmit it. risk obvious greatly reduced. punish breach. AZ exporting anything EU gets doses promised. It’s ridiculous it’s toxic. Like, “people?” guess could argue it’s media it’s Fauci whatever moving goal posts, even don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone say *forever.* Late year return normalcy extreme I’ve seen get anyone credible, unless we’re using toddler idea forever, one saying we’re working perceived oppression. mean, least government collecting property taxes building. idea government would tell can't collect rent property, ""oh yeah, fuck you, still need pay me"" beyond ridiculous.

Starting March said there’s need wear mask, last month said 2 masks effective one (this increases airflow sides mask ruins whole point). Except fact ton vaccine. vaccine leveling yeah wouldn’t bode well missed huge part ... Mexican can’t wait government allow vaccinated Americans country

You know bad things Mexico right covid. agree definitely still need masks can’t burn yet. won’t mind wearing one going store something like that, can’t measure inconvenience time something takes put on. Humans social creatures part reading cues body language, face important part that. can’t disregard say it’s big deal someone spend entire day one surrounded them. Interactions feel less personal way that’s big deal. aren’t woods yet I’m saying it’s time ditch them, minimizing social impact isn’t helpful either. trying avoid making ignorant, sweeping generalizations people know nothing makes bad guy, it. Anyone downvoting needs re-evaluate life decisions.

Thanks replying, though. Another one block list. sad opinion worth time read further. Doctor, hurts go like this! people saying mandatory masks healthy people every flu season. It’s minor sense put it, I’m going keep wearing mask it’s right thing do, pain ass wear day, it’s mildly uncomfortable, dehumanizes everyone see. no, it’s huge deal, annoying.  mean, least government collecting property taxes building. idea government would tell can't collect rent property, ""oh yeah, fuck you, still need pay me"" beyond ridiculous.

That's different behavior we've seen government pandemic though. willingness people foist costs onto one group something collective expense astonishing/disgusting. issues

Ventilation every row shared seven rows so. There's curtain air every seat. 

There much less ventilation ground. Whether connected ground power apu, amazing fresh bleed air coming in. 

There's humidity speak of, afaik boosts spread.

Comfort issues long haul flights, especially better masks. 

Airports. source new normal talking about? There's certainly people want to-go cocktails teleworking options. seriously sub dramatic sometimes. COVID won’t kill OP apparently comma would.

That's understood reasons countries besides US allow exports vaccines. relative backs Oxford vaccine 'even variants need ""reason"" support position. That's why. Via infectious material surfaces. Another good option theory would curovac MRNA require freezing. However also heard phase one numbers AZ/J&amp;J range really move needle opinion. one moves needle require sort freezing nvax far. Statistically, is. Regardless, Israel decided deserved it. Yeah seems like moral panic. I'm sure tons people voluntarily wear mask things like they're sick prevent pollen allergies. idea there's conspiracy force everyone wear masks forever fear mongering. case hospitalization numbers

We still 80,000+ new cases 2,000+ new deaths per day US.

And people less worried numbers half that. would enforced? one CCP-style “hard lockdown” dystopian fantasies? come point people sit idly by. 1,420 cases Illinois! numbers going down. Let's go Chicago! :D Literally 70% adult Americans overweight obese. add lean Americans medical issues we're probably well 80%. yeah, talking ""pre-existing conditions"" like least 4/5 country stupid. also easier make Pfizer vaccine grow cell cultures long advance? Forgive ignorance stupid question. And? costs? paying 2020, getting paid 2020? There's good chance clue talking about, ""lmao"". 

How much property own?

Just someone pays taxes make automatically rich, especially pandemic people often can't/don't pay rent. Emoluments? Careful cut edge. downplay death children please. even thought long term effects 1/3rd current child population long term health problems? think already taxed healthcare system able handle long term palliative care boomers permanently damaged youth? mean sticking landlords kind makes look like bad guy here, whatever yo. thinking I'm sad bitter makes feel better standing side exploitation, means, it. always money. thing we've consumed articles screaming ""Stay $#%&amp; home"" exposure covid feels like personal failure. Like fault ""doing enough"". Got grocery store? gotten delivered. Got friend's house? stayed home. stuff like makes people feel like getting covid somehow ""their fault"" simply virus taking course vaccine really move needle covax nvax. clean pretty well that. people actively flu controversial imo. poilte. show vaccine passports virus. COVID different especially low IFR younger adults. 

Doing vaccine passports get concerts sets dangerous precedent future imo. bet he’s also going attacked right probably use money enjoyment charitable cause publicly. I’m sure would done anyways privately. income classified unearned income. literally, technically, earn income. Nobody gives fuck greedy landlord enough property pay 120K property tax every year deal extraordinary hardship sick woman paying rent couple months. Go sell property first time homeowner stop hoarding properties unearned investment income driving prices want people take concern trolling seriously. Got actual sources chairito? ""The crisis likely end year make money scared."" Well, one valid criticisms cognitive behavioural therapy believes anyone think away problem, disregarding minimizing real problems poverty. exactly issue here. one issues trial US 15% people age 65 although UK one much higher want say close 30 percent worldwide sales largely mitigates. generally done really good job trials though said like bad thing lol teacher Florida teach brick mortar -since August. telling don’t deserve get it? Umm New Zealand’s unemployment rate went economy bounced back strongly even economists revise negative outlook. Even though international tourism one New Zealand’s main industry, economy still performed well Covid doesn’t really negatively impact thanks short lockdowns. That's probably true, too. GA forced teachers back teachers passed away Covid....but still arent able get vaccinated. someone makes statement online, allowed responded to. yeah, want understand, matters me.

I'm planning harass people masks, masks normal. 

You pretty aggressive. Id rather give million dollars guy knowingly lied Americans said masks weren’t necessary. business? know Reddit hates ""both sides"" talk, really think true case. 

Republicans took big dislike masks, reactive laws politics meant Democrats make God's gift suffering humanity. Thus total mask refusal one hand hand people wear mask alone cars even double masks. Much world thought poorly US pandemic, going make worse. Feels reals. united states cut company's NIH research grant last April ties Wuhan Institute. conflict interest open since beginning. weird even picked recuse was. Facts hurt. Wearing masks saves lives. Lol studies India. cuz need open separate hubs rural villages pay people come get it. would faster cheaper central hub admin vaccines. rural people can't afford come big central hubs vaccines Tapper good interviews, asks great questions holds speakers task. said, teachers option distance learning. Many healthy individuals also died covid-19 complications. end much sight. Mass vaccination always light end tunnel, that's fast approaching. get last this. Even then, ""normal"" switch that's flipped March 19 March 20 say ""ok over."" also live Chicago (I'm making assumption here), think crazy think people actually *like* wearing masks. make seem like people wearing masks downright giddy it. think early vaccines impact? Dude claiming paying 120K property taxes lmao. fucking math. Laws need change, states strict anti-mask laws temporarily suspended. people wore masks pre-mandate we're technically committing felony states. believe that’s preliminary research point yet actual recommendation Dr. Türeci Dr. Şahin get like every science award there, going riot them.  new variants scary regards possibility vaccines may effective them. ending, clearly see looking good faith discussion. looking insult belittle feel differently you. Way contribute division. great day! *just* though. flip flopping lot lately. One week says start returning normal spring another says may semblance normal fall. want work 😩 I'm smart enough figure out, guarantee someone study. I'm clever, clever. That’s told everyone use hand sanitizer year ago. check news sources countries provide vaccines. US. They’re holding themselves. trump showed asshole consequences Biden filled suit. love shared history India Brazil (where live) helping fight generic medicines heavy patents. Unfortunately, current Brazilian goverment betrayed India international discussion patents stuff related covid19.... Moderna delivers nothing. I’m sure midterms deliver. hope Q2. Q1 moderna failing fully. 

AZ useless: SA strain wide spreading jn Europe. Forget it, forget. 

Curevac condition good trial outcome produce deliver lot. BioNTech us best hope. Production good scalability. 

Novavax quite interesting. US company rather chance Q3, ie. US fully vaccinated. 

J&amp;J op. Protection weak count herd immunity. worry, someone jump claim ""the science changed!"" Even though didn't. Science always told us resperatory diseases spread indoors, especially schools, masks great form protection. studies looked/looking long term effects young kids? EU invest billion euros factory US find out? so? Trump fund AIDS research something? deserves nothing jail cell. That's what's discussed. issue people trying say masks major inconvenience mask compliance requires great sacrifices. regard specific branch conversation referencing, poster took offense pandemic response fared poorly large part weak national mask compliance. kids young, statistical likelihood. Millions Americans going shit without ever wearing mask...  Deleting comments taking responsibility. Taking responsibility standing corrected necessary. deleting history. Sorry that's people know looking it. others may disagree know large pool really is. people looking something allow get normalcy. vaccine really that. people would pursued vaccine already virus, probably quite mild symptomatic, really care getting vaccine. especially case get antibodies checked antibodies. two cousins virus mild told me, ""f vaccine"" Remember lied everyone mask effectiveness order preserve masks healthcare workers, result eroded people’s trust health officials caused widespread confusion skepticism masks persists day? Pepperidge farm remembers: 


“If look masks buy drug store, leakage around really much protect you. People start saying, 'Should start wearing mask?' Now, United States, absolutely reason whatsoever wear mask."" - Dr. Anthony Fauci, February 2020


“There’s reason walking around mask. you’re middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet, it’s providing perfect protection people think is. And, often, unintended consequences — people keep fiddling mask keep touching face.” - Dr. Anthony Fauci, March 2020 Bowflex definitely still around. like people stop spending money home gyms end never using.

Not though. get muscle mass praying Tauon That's heck leap logic based said, I'm sure went way.  🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ minor physically financially. 

It minor mentally socially. statement March meant allow limited mask supplies directed toward healthcare facilities virus prevalent that’s sick people (and virus) exist highest density, could protect critical line defense: healthcare workers.

Two masks effective long wear properly-fitting masks.

I’m saddened many people still don’t grasp seemingly self-evident points. we'll agree disagree. states getting rid entry rules continue next two three months. point pandemic likely largely US restrictions rapidly thrown out. Nobody wants confirm this, based published rumors contentious point never price. reason negotiations dragged long liability question vaccines produced profit. There's nothing large corporations afraid liability.

In words, EU's stance rather reasonable - ""hey, gave money upfront, going make preordained profit here. mRNA tech pan out, want money back.""

Pfizer Moderna eager commit preliminary results Phase III trials started coming out. find totally dehumanizing too. child also visibly depressed wear them. make idea sense self autonomy. She’s young old enough understand choice. that’s part frustrates her. also feel hypocritical telling controls body making conceal everything eyes. It’s awful parent. honest. I’m sure feelings enrage many people. 

I think making wear masks walking street also stupid hell. I’m sure much longer I’m gonna force that. really matter. Everyone getting vaccinated that's thing matters. fact UK good job vaccine roll overrides mistakes made. 95% effective vaccine Creepy way phrase think domestic travel while. Lots states entry rules already, different variants mutations, need get control else even worse months!  lockdowns turned ineffective, would like see political careers destroyed people end jail prolonged lockdowns. would shape voting causes donate going forward also. outside that, wouldn’t come much. 

There great updates also lot fear mongering sometimes seems never ending. disaster. Australians going trapped island indefinitely. happen surprisingly soon probably month. I'll get worried vaccines available nobody take them. Paywall, anyone got link? Yeah like get politician would strategic lying let’s equate “defending science” 🙄 Glad companies trying make flying safe again!  Yep. Got now. Son unos genios de verdad es increíble, asombra como se les olvida respirar.

Son un orgullo la nación, bravo, bravísimo. Apparently least partly lipid nanoparticles: reactogenicity mRNA vaccines Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna likely largely due bubble fat used package mRNA. bubbles, called lipid nanoparticles, seem stimulate immune system animals even empty. past, vaccine makers sometimes added second ingredient vaccine, called adjuvant, enhance immune response. lipid nanoparticle, originally designed protect mRNA smuggle inside cells, happened act adjuvant well. “It’s like three-in-one package,” Fuller says.  Ah OK. see. Israel also wanted trump win re-election.... bhai india mai kam pad rhi hai lekin pehle mexico ko dedo 

modi hai mumkin hai let's forget landlords create NOTHING. simply live sweat, blood, tears Hardwork tenants mercy society creates artificial shortages housing. create economic value, constrain it.

What horrible hot take is.

Of course landlords create something. 22 million apartments country buildings 5 units. units simply get built without landlords willing invest time capital so.

You would think people purport care environment housing costs shit people actually building multi-unit housing combats suburban sprawl increasing housing prices. goal posts shift “bend curve” “no one get sick”? you’re teacher might get sick... like might get sick flu season. agree completely disagree. US stated exports can't occur current contracts filled. think months we'll start see vaccines shipped abroad US.

A lot countries protective supply. Earlier pandemic lot Asian countries paused exports PPE desired level domestic supply. EU army lawyers making sure vaccines produced go right member states, many countries pushing build production facilities inside borders protect interests.

The US anything countries also doing. I’m sure terrifying me.


Not knowing lot virus beginning afraid getting sick.


or


Knowing everything know today close getting vaccinated getting sick. many countries even states entry rules. airlines need follow suit! wants quarantine hotel get quick test done airport? possible things reduce mandates advising unvaccinated people keep masking distancing dropping entirely mean worried getting enough Pfizer Novavax may backup. mean hope Canada already fully vaccinated Canada keep Novavax donate rest COVAX something. “Israel's largest health fund Clalit looked positive tests 600,000 vaccinated people number unvaccinated people, matched age health status.” Thank good news!! Geez! Show much Canada paid made deal.

""Ottawa announced agreements Moderna Pfizer-BioNTech Aug. 5; Novavax Janssen, subsidiary Johnson &amp; Johnson, Aug. 31; Sanofi/GSK Sept. 22; AstraZeneca, manufacturing vaccine developed University Oxford, Sept. 25; Medicago Oct. 23.""

August earliest, consider early?

By June US dumped $3bn vaccine research like said started procurement March.

The UK put 5X per capita funding vaccine research compared EU.

The EU commission grossly negligent, blame US UK commissions failings repeat things proof. Canada fucked begging vaccines around world. M'mask. Public health disease mitigation. includes mental health social well being. replying quote, literally calling Oxford vaccine second best, though see could misunderstood. think vaccinating people important thing. Love partnership ExpresSpa United. added convenience extra layer safety makes traveling lot better! getting voted right. Also see statements school reopenings. go way back beginning saying worry much virus effecting americans. track record better dude's. 3 cases receive Pfizer vaccine? know? forced go back work crowded casino thousands different people visiting everyday. different? teachers get vaccine don’t? I’m personally fine getting right away think oldest get first. add I’m really trying sound like I’m snarky. don’t see hot topic right 21, 2020 - Fauci explains Americans need worry COVID 19

This 2 months US declared pandemic. I'm sure wrong 17, 2020 - Fauci explains masks ineffective risk getting COVID minusculely low

I agree wrong masks. understanding trying save PPE healthcare workers want run masks general public. elaborated upfront importance masks prevent spread. month US declared pandemic though, risk time still 9, 2020 - Fauci explains taking cruise could fun safe thing healthy

This still US declared pandemic 1 known outbreak cruise ship aware of. message ok young healthy seem base 17, 2020 - Fauci explains New York handled pandemic correctly

I'm sure issue 24, 2020 - Fauci sits baseball game without mask without social distancing

This seems like stretch. He's outdoors 2 close friends takes mask briefly? though, think links conflict Fauci's overall message since pandemic declared wearing mask (or 2) practice social distancing. I'd hardly say ""he's wrong every stage pandemic"" instead feel he's mostly right. trials? ? needs pull bootstraps. fault try hard enough born wealthy family. anyone know what's difference that, old, yellow book? thing he's chatted shit pandemic, yeah he's hero. lmfao get real man. think difference usually norovirus couple days many ""damages"" pay out. Workers comp gets involved seriously injured affecting ability work. sick even need go doctor, get better there's many damages could claim. guess ""pain suffering"" couple days sick assume that'd tossed quickly RECEIPTS know couples remain apart COVID? Ones one died COVID.

Buck up, least still alive. won't.... efficacy high enough move needle given much better vaccines there. 80 percent worth one shot v two trade-off imo many elderly people technical knowhow get appointment. I've helped elderly relatives, I'm concerned people kind support system getting left behind. Cases hospitalizations declining Florida California. Period.

Can point immunity waning time? recent study flies face that. Lied masks Yes why. likely approved 65 guess. using quote minister, referring second best option Yeah one thing politcians want crash economy, bankrupt businesses, close schools keep people locked in. Tipico argumento chairo lmao AstraZeneca trial dosing intervals large enough numbers use. head-to-head control group statistically significant 12 week gap. They're asserting ""exploratory analysis."" literally *no* trial data different dosing intervals would work 65+.

Same assertion protects severe illness vs. South African variant/emerging strain. trial result. 

For nation position Australia, choices racing community epidemics, makes *no* sense use AstraZeneca. wonder 65 thing US anything many age group already offered Pfizer Moderna point. appeared Novavax allowed potential trial users easy chance get different vaccine. know Novavax really pressing get US trial done fast current US rollout hinders further. Nope. CureVac provide lot Q2. bit Q1. Problem phase III. Anyone know solid info indicating aspirin anti inflammatory second vaccine decrease effective is? Waking what? definitely unknown territory far workers comp goes. Insurance companies always deny things first though even super obvious workplace injuries, it'll interesting see happens this. could get hold pieces N95 masks something equivalent. Healthcare works face face directly covid patients like January December nobody batted eye. Cause it’s job. go teachers. Everyone else go work this. feel bad kids today. Remote learning young age cause irreversible damage. careful Australia. heard that’s racist Mexicans. fuck done deserve million quid. Thank you! saw post r/india , basically sub angsty teens hating anything india. Yes. ""semblance"" scares me. add VT population skews older take longer finish older age groups. I'd say we're pretty poorly vaccine supply adequate. really states fault still problem. Considering vaccination schedule NZ, wait long time still. That's scientific sub reddit! Largely completely lol share one cause english quite articles french:

* Trajectories matter, fact nursing homes vaccinated. ¿Que se siente que la mayoría de nuestro país se vea como lo que odias?

Nunca voy entender este tipo de delirios de superioridad. true, India done much president done country’s covid 19 crisis. already rolling back Northeast Never mind, see Thanks finding this! haven’t heard mutations yet, that’ll interesting find functional advantages. reading realized hadn’t read second data set, apologize. also, different numbers? pandemic requires cooperation level US simply have. China worked, really model example.

You'll notice authoritarian government's exactly contain virus either, China's case actually unique.

Of course, nobody fully trusts China real 0 cases either.

Answers dichotomy. US total shitshow, China definitely right either. real question is, would US needed tackle pandemic successfully? Cant really vaccinate population cant get vaccines.... Read news decry jumping assertions.

The US outbreak would never reached severity sheer incompetence Trump admin. fan biden least administration acting way Covid emergency requires Yeah guy who’s entire life work studying pandemics doesn’t clue. He’s widely considered one one worlds preeminent experts pandemics I’m sure know better. say you’re conspiracy theorist completely make scenario lacking shred evidence. 

Usually, educated people come conclusions based evidence. It’s kooky conspiracy theorists unfortunate people born low iq go gut, evidence damned. 

The evidence suggests second group. Joke's you, skipped right 2029. Good read, thanks! Seems like concerned supply chain logistics manufacture / distribution / installation large scale microfluidizer type equipment particular. 

I'm expert microfluidizer manufacturing, initial assertion still stands recruit folks build supply chains foresee bottlenecks. site count one hand many places manufacture devices. opinion: So? arent Pluto. They're still made earth earthbound materials earthlings. 

My concern bottlenecks within bottlenecks (specialized equipment) companies reliant one individuals specific skills know-how. Getting knowledge others would likely take time hold process everyone else.

I heard story years ago quality assurance person, working major filter company line filters fitted housing literally one 70 something year old man less alone decades. expect world mostly normal world

*the United States America correct. apologies. 9 people/organizations figured, two connection Russia Igor Nikunin failed political candidate Michael Chossudovsky, runs Canadian website Global Research presumably Russian name, guess.

Russia appears exactly 8 times entire text.

So 1 2 9. Sounds like majority huh. Free Palestine. EU using approach UK, funding factories country consumption. difference got game late, factories still early teething problems yet producing volumes eventually hoped for.

They slow partly thought careful conservative, treated like trades deal. Sometimes criticised UK reckless, think could move fast without cutting corners. happening consequence choices. others screwing them. UK plan vaccinate teachers ahead anybody else. sure need priority us low risk anyway. Lol could say moment sound incredibly callous, even though correct non-transmission-inhibiting vaccine scenario precautionary measures place would missing then.

I think know risk groups risk severe long term effects virus. mutations Q677P data suggest variant deadly lmao, estimated infection rates matched mortality second wave first wave. 

Even transmissible still debate tbh, definitely transmissable nowhere near 70% number first reported. US: Total COVID-19 vaccine doses administered per 100 people,
Feb 14, 2021

Alaska: US: Share people received least one dose of
COVID-19 vaccine, Feb 14, 2021

Alaska: 17.28

So 17% Alaska's population received least one dose, 8% received 2 doses. Efficacy word. [IATA Travel Pass likely future version Yellow Book. IATA Timatic already forms basis airline operations comes entry requirements passport app need integrate that. easy option airlines largest consumers technology. Well got work permit italy hard all. Ironically everything building written Arabic probably 100 people waiting outside. Plenty north africans either working getting money sit around harass locals post 94% efficiency spelling. end pandemic countries Cool. Adults handling anyway, think less add Ireland list too. Ireland officially restricted use AZ 65s said mRNA vaccines prioritised. parents Ireland age category, honest, think terrible strategy – locked home stands, see no-one go nowhere, and, according current estimates, they're still going get vaccine coming weeks, substantial delay vis vis AZ. Given choice, I'd prefer mRNA vaccine, seem bit better AZ anyway. Preparation cheating.  Fact is, 80+% must vaccinated 90+% efficacy ""herd immunity"". 
Without achieving herd threshold, many engage much riskier behavior resulting even transmissions. 
ie. 8 10 individuals vaccinated one protected exposure vector thing accelerate. ice cold take saw another sub it’s vaccines masks, nay! What’s really happening cases aren’t declining tests aren’t picking nEw sTrAiNs! 🙄 Yeah well state usurped vaccines means distribution, state efficiently. give single damn intend can't get commercial basis, much faster.

Had possible pay one, I'd vaccinated already See say came Chinese lab, everyone assumes mean China purposefully released it. all. least. China brilliant scientific research sector. 

But researchers people. People make mistakes. England researcher made mistake Small Pox 1970s led someone's infection death decades virus eradicated. 

And ""characteristics match would expected arise wild."" Yes, course do, again, China trying pull mad scientist bs, probably trying induce mutation develop cures based that. 

One dropped vial, one rip one bio hazard suit, one bit clumsiness. That's took.

India good prescription drugs come from, IYKWIM. without trait, would died thousands years ago. we're endgame Possibly unpopular opinion: country dealt virus longer problem, care virus anymore. Can't restrict life year expect care burning Republic Kenzakoya 0.5 GDP per capita. felt like imagine winning lottery would feel. teaching face face full classroom since October. students wearing masks, CDC guidelines followed. scared going school every single day. governor hide places value education value educators. Teachers aren’t even close eligible state. able get vaccine last week Walgreens neighboring state teachers eligible, relief felt indescribable. Goverment mafia. basically saying goverment bad create goverment Yes know lol. obviously factors play. Never said reason cases falling Yes, US resources country world. excuses ineptitude. great news. USA got decimated virus finally seems turning corner. sooner help themselves, sooner begin helping others. even immunity still pass CV people. That's vaccinations work. good know Reddit hivemind still reads headlines never articles downvotes accordingly.

We're fighting novel coronavirus mutating (as widely expected) we're fighting rampant stupidity. human race fucked. Yeah, giving Biden credit US vaccination program stupid US ahead every single EU country Trump left office. meant like ngos picking people rafts last years data transmission? want eat raw fish coronavirus concern?? Illinois dropping since Thanksgiving. minions board NJ checking in, vaccines teachers yet winning race vaccines vs variants? Karen? Well like 5 people live there....so 😆 love keep exporting jobs, vaccination campaign completely halted. Europe.... Nope soon numbers dip come droves. Seriously, NPR ashamed So... 1 dose 2 doses Pfizer vaccine? would interesting see drop single dose.  tropical disease vaccines way crazier terms side effects. Yep. I'm living one. South Korea way behind. US soldiers got vaccine, that's it. BUY DIP HOLD felt 24 hours two shots. Slightly worse second first shot. pleasant, nothing worry either. Ah! would make difference. Absolutely. agree we're selfish species, generally speaking. Oh know ... buy time. 😊

Nah, look number cases Amazon region. it’s 8 days since SuperBowl, Florida’s cases still downward trajectory. watching cases dive deaths stay up. making bit suspicious. Latin American countries Cuba Uruguay didn’t many deaths per capita. also Asian countries deaths per capita, Indonesia Philippines. Also, deaths per capita Wuhan 300 per million least.

Southeast South Asian countries better responses Western nations, that’s all. Western countries New Zealand, Norway Australia good responses well. Isn’t crazy people think a) Covid hoax b) vaccine also hoax. No. would nothing “this time”. still statistically insignificant, already know it’s possible spread like reason “alarmed”. Wait what?? worked treatment plant lab one stores samples even state data environmental regulators send records representative inspects labs time time.  found article also fascinating Phuket trying sort vaccines:  Thanks great explanation, makes sense. that's daily positivity rate 1-2%, yeah? So, 1,984,000,000. Sorry hear that. different state state district district. school 68% students back managing group normally possible, masks, also trying make online effective (things like making home- safe lab kits available pickup) students/ families chose option challenging- worth we're tired see social media stuff blasting us lazy. Parents near suing last year try get mask requirement schools removed since state made local mask enforcement illegal. Nope Roamer virus need able vaccinate kids get herd immunity. 

We need get herd immunity get back normal.

Kids approved summer/fall then, adults done lots supply. expect approved kids fully vaccinated fall (assuming trails go fine) present simplistic wrong argument. We've always work. state dictated schools go remote spring worked 95 days straight without taking single day make work best could. I'v teaching person since August simulataneously handling groups students fully remote. Withdraw WHO! Go form multinational health organisation Yeah I’m basically trying get math? 1% chance die- higher?? 70% seems like lot. chairos people. lol course. folks Oxford even. find CNN BBC reporting Isn’t US approach day 1 though? US doesn’t allow exports all. hospitalizations/deaths manageable level majority elderly/at risk folks vaccinated, time FULL reopening.

back normal, everything open. Seems completely baseless fear mongering. can't make assumptions downplay Covid also can't make assumptions make worse fearmonger people Nebraska. in-person whole school year. wife teacher hasn’t even given timeline expect receive first doses. Meanwhile, state Iowa, mostly virtual, many wife’s friends also teachers receiving already received first doses. It’s completely fucked. unforgiving loans attached. Hold phone... There's Nigerian variant now??? two officials said doses new deal could delivered June.  second cautious, pointing difficulties Moderna faced delivering 10 million doses EU first quarter 2021.

I guess depends definition ""some"" anything better nothing. Getting approval add another 5 doses vial going big step forward. You’ve listening wrong people ever thought whole thing would less 1-2 years. dying painfully virus? help balance scale pain? locked couple billions Canada hasn’t even approved AstraZeneca vaccine yet Americans 16 amount 210 million people, administered 52 million shots rate 2 million shots per day. feels like know people gotten least one shot encompassed healthcare, teachers, public transport people need most. Somehow case.

If count different active priority groups, get 20 25% (over 15% randos 65+). also includes leakage non-priority people somehow gotten shot government workers dubious importance. could first shot every member ""high-risk quarter"" two weeks fully vaccinated little 3. I'd willing bet still thousands teachers able get single dose time next month every member ever professional sports team option. vast majority Chinese people government putting odds CCP puts odds them. It’s like foreigner saying nothing personally, it’s government want overthrow replace.  People subjecting kids requirements line risks face. now, makes sense given high cost face. second vaccines available everyone wants it, able make choices, kids included (even vaccine much out).

People using possibility continued infection post vaccination adults among kids spectre irresponsible view. Sorry generalized bit far include amongst them. Many schools full time year get shots. one them. We've fully person since first day school stopped, lucky enough get shot first week February. 
Also, according articles ""several districts"" refusing go back person. one school within large district that's saying can't make work safely. also said go back district agrees three foot social distancing guidelines, that's hardly unreasonable. Akron still saying go back, extending weeks ensure staff vaccinated. Again, that's unreasonable. government prioritized getting safety measures place schools vaccine, schools could opened sooner. People work schools clue amount protocols takes school person safely. reason could money allowed us hire staff keep class sizes smaller, install sanitizing stations school, strict temp checks, mask wearing, social distancing, increasing technology schools learning engaging socially distanced. last school ohio worked even hot water, class sizes insane. vaccine necessary first step, schools following promise go back time, simple that. According Phase 1/2 reports, safety profiles good, see Seeing lot fun math here. case death drops entirely connected distance holiday season. Less people gathering, less people traveling. That’s it. nowhere near herd immunity. bottleneck funding, production capacity. 50% distribution would decided private interests. Eventually wont true anymore work. michael mina genius. i’ll read later find time except quarantine asymptomatic cases 

By contacts humble opinion, four reasons cases dropping US.

1. Weather. America seen major winter weather lately. People self-isolating due extreme cold.
2. Less testing. Many testing centers transformed vaccination sites. Fewer people seeking tests, fewer tests administered.
3. Natural seasonality. coming winter peak. 
4. Dumb luck. reprieve temporary, soon weather warms cases increase.

Vaccines natural immunity might role play, point enough attribute drastic decline cases. biggest contributing factor human behavior. We’re still several months away that, get comfortable we’re right now. Currently diner thought would super quiet. almost 70% capacity indoors. Almost every booth full. Mom still wanted sit anyways

New Jersey regulations supposed half situation sounds different companies. Fortunately, vaccination Turkey well underway. Besides, know effect transmission severity is. might less, might same, might more. time research tell. Well live dorm private room. I’m thinking moving single would still use public shower (but people now) public bathroom. really worth moving then? Either way, use public shower bathroom. usually wear mask go room, come bathroom/sink usage. move without share big bathroom sinks. live Sweden, face-to-face since forever.. big problems really. hard talk reddit, people seem understand negatively affected lockdowns, affected people. (everyone) buy Test Kits normal Drug Store, well Vending Machine!

Price 4.000¥/ 35€ EU probably vaccinate 450 million Biontech, Moderna AZ alone. Hopefully J&amp;J Curevac deliver doses Q2 well. NERVTAG's research, linked Op-Toe, very, mixed results across range different hospitals. think early officials making statements like Fauci's. Oh sorry, employees. work myself, get paid work do. coworkers, situation similar them. websites track notable US events state? Beyond numbers, looking timeline tracks things like closures, lock timing, re-openings, etc. false thousand variants future variants come assure one rushed vaccines protect see coming reported going everyday. People say want endless lockdowns afraid losing ability WFH. longer goes see true selfishness people, wanting protect caring much effects actions others. Whether wearing masks uncomfortable, wanting places open fear losing ability work homes. 100% it’s flip side coin people dooming variants vaccines effective Yep... suck, going happen nothing it.  teacher friends NJ, in-person teachers definitely gotten first shot. one friends school psychologist hundreds kids, see person whole time. yet eligible vaccine. guess teachers get it, probably administrators due overinflated sense self-importance government access, at-school personnel, like social workers, go fuck themselves. article mean ""standard schedule"" thought AZ study showed 82% efficacy 12 week schedule UK adopted?

The article seems going interpretation ""standard schedule"" is. vaccine updated SA variant I'm sure, sooner better. He's saying people painfully dying virus midst national lockdown evictable works hard make living nobody gives breaks. said “people defensive now” I’m responding that. That’s comment sections work. Uh, realize communicating people subset behavior right? 

Please tell know that. said ""because previous 1.7 billion vaccines produced annually stopped existing, right,"" elevated non-COVID vaccines level COVID vaccines. point new plants specifically COVID vaccines put multiple countries, retrofitted, almost certainly resulting distribution that's different existing infrastructure whole. Using tetanus vaccines support ""the EU makes 70% COVID vaccines"" gross misrepresentation data used A) almost 12 months old B) related COVID vaccine specifically. Happily no, know extreme. put mask kids. mention anything school mask only. hard keep on. Anoyying hell think worth overall. Well they've plummeting month, NYT can't report every day. district currently trying force teachers back middle March, likely couple weeks teachers could fully vaccinated.

Aside issues reopening, strikes particularly moronic spend year school reopen could wait another couple weeks far safely.

But lot parents loudly insisting schools need reopen ASAP. Yeah theory it’s dropping doesn’t really make sense me. chance Covid starting burn media/pharmaceutical companies don’t want admit it? curious. Cool. Still going eh? Behaviour? I'm collection text screen.    literally came 5 days ago.. Trump's executive order binding, symbolic effort ""America First."" Like many things administration, appearances rather actual results. average age way lower western nations.  helps mitigate negative impact uncontrolled spread huge degree. Brazil Child administered vaccines Mexico. countries able achieve rely Pfizer Moderna initial supplies, there's that.
Don't let facts ruin opinions though, mainstream media Mexico make look like every country Mexico tremendous success rolling vaccine. Reality says otherwise. Kay nothing article attacking person - keep up!

Considering behavior, could see projection. It’s great, vaccines, it’s end world. chances dying still incredibly low healthy young person. comments. vaccine effective B.1.1.7, Nelly strain become dominant US soon; boosters developed. Except countries contracts pharmaceutical companies get contracts delivered certain date factories sudden. gives EU right suddenly stop honouring contracts? pharmaceutical companies would set elsewhere EU said last year can't export say reason ""masks"". says changes people's behavior general, masks, distancing, staying home, etc. that's perfectly reasonable take. reason *isn't* vaccines, early that, either behavior, herd immunity, seasonality, combination three. AZ vaccine absolutely zero 
(As data show) mild/moderate good sign vs severe. Thats SA using AZ vaccine.

The UK requiring incoming passengers effected countries quarantine government approved hotel 14 days 10k fine comply. correct move. would suspect main vaccine using (AZ) ineffective SA variant. Note said 'suspect' one really knows available data pointing wrong way. People defensive almost year it’s non stop doom gloom here. Even light good news tons people chiming telling us it’s actually good news going like years. Everyone it. wear mask go continue so, virus reaches flu deaths per year that’s it. I’ll take chances variants whatever comes I’m living like another year. much China pay social
Media work showed public information European Federation Pharmaceutical Industries Associations (EFPIA).

What showed far besides bitching moaning? Right.

I'm still waiting, lazy, go get figures show European Federation Pharmaceutical Industries Associations (EFPIA) spreading false information. process already started. end March, suspect half country mask mandates. 

When protest season starts, remaining areas forced fall one one. LOL, attacking person - keep up! Definitely adds belief validity comments. Keeping mind insulted called name. that's ok. Keep yelling. know, vaccine produced Belgium Belgian government foresight get early sign deal Pfizer ensuring citizens got X percentage produced vaccine?

Oh yes, European commission intervened told countries like Belgium allowed deals vaccines EU negotiating for. took 3 **months** longer finally changed mind joined European military

An EU military would effective vaccine program... much good. wars would they'd even ordered Russia going picking slag world remember

The world remember UK sold IP vaccine ensured sold countries cost price throughout pandemic. world remember UKs vaccine India producing 'pick slag[sic]'. Tell me, Biotech Pfzier vaccine, much per dose exactly? come EU also mandate must sold makes understand UK truly never commited Europe it

Delusional. mean, possibility along. don’t think anything said chance permanent damage going variants. I’m wrong, let know. 

OP asking specifically death, healthy young people, chance still low even 70% increase. Fragile people like reminded pandemic, want ignore go back ""the times"". click every potentially positive Covid headline come across. Desperate good news. thought would others like me? Maybe news doesn’t realize us searching good news. 15 million people OFFERED vaccine people actually vaccinated could lower I've lived Brazil, US Europe. Brazilians crazy good personal hygiene compared others. say anything Tetanus shots, one mentioned it, please share figures tatanus shot production yields Europe then. Would teachers motivated go back work essential workers gave standing ovations everyday?

Teachers turning whiniest bunch whole pandemic. even children they're supposed teach. absence answers, authorities U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) World Health Organization say use antipyretics fever-reducing medications recommended time vaccination. **They approved days vaccination.**

I’ve highlighted important bit. Pain relievers fine take day two get shot side effects making uncomfortable. don’t take right shot precaution. understand correctly Moderna looking delivering doses promised June AZ probably even deliver previously suggested quantities. looking like EU vaccinated mainly Pfizer Moderna, possible additions J&amp;J Curevac approved available decent quantities. come India real number 8 lakh. Like, dude, argument claiming deleted still publically viewable.

I honestly know sort drugs taking, kind want now; seeing going fantastic lengths semblence conversation. Thanksgiving Christmas boosted numbers, seems massive drop expected infections ran course. see cases continue drop next months. scientific investigation. Impartiality moot.

So suppose trust tobacco related researched funded tobacco companies? need criminal investigation conflicts interest. There’s whole brand vaccine join pipeline March (J&amp;J) that’s taken account. companies making current vaccines building capacity well. I'm going sound really stupid lol mean fill finish. like packaging vaccine? Given Modi spent years US terror watch list, much say many freakin covid variants jeez Vaccine production might non-zero game, vaccine distribution is. Pfizer deciding priorize country others, giving US doses quicklier anticipated upholding compromises us (Chile) probably consequence political pressure. I'm asking stop America First doctrine, I'm asking stop judging poor countries taking Chinese Russian vaccines. Sorry, fair point, thinking Northeast live, huge snowstorm weeks ago.

But still think snow isn’t main reason decline, since numbers dropping everywhere US, places current snow.

For example, NY State, snowstorm-related dip clearly fewer cases started. productivity higher, output less wasted time commuting less wasted time sitting office finished deliverables, massive reduction money spent office space. thinking along lines white sapphire organization compromised Take precautions risk group, fine Telepathic transmission show document crossing international border.... like 1984 times million. control supply goes. governor vaccinating cities people vote him.

Yeah, that's AstraZaneca went silent EU contract published, ""best effort clause"" hold well ""best effort"" fulfill one contract detriment others - that's best effort, that's taking sides.

Why think UK made contract public alleged ""security reasons""?

If went court AZ show contracts, conflict interests would fucked. Suddenly plants improved yield production vaccines delivered EU negotiate well here.

Oh agree 100% - light know today EU made pretty clear - vaccine leaves European soil EU orders met. vaccines infection 30% US level immunity now, low end. June number lest 50%.

By end summer almost everyone wants vaccine one.

Masks literally everyone public spaces flu season? Get Well, EU made contract public attitude AstraZaneca suddenly changed stopped talking media - reality probably signed contracts overlap taking sides contracts - imo clearly what's happening here.

UK refused made contract public ""security reasons"".

At point EU concerned citizens global opinion EU is. trying get global goodwill points lead example screwed territory - enough enough. problem. long doctor feels safe take condition, fine Potentially exposure, likely late test positive. should. Hopefully states join pointlessly drag out. Pennsylvania complete shitshow. There’s ton doses sitting around, way make appointments without navigating arcane user-unfriendly computer system. big chunk people eligible first round entirely unable navigate system get doses. sell pharma company then?? vaccine stop next wave. still think early credit vaccine huge drop. even tentative end date metric getting harder. life need goals work toward feel like I’m stalling. COVID goals seems. Even vaccinations it’s going enough stop restrictions. always new strain we’ll put goalposts Jupiter “out abundance caution.” guess adjust wearing mask everywhere public rest life point (even sick) public government leaders never want give up.

Pfizer supplied 40 thousands. way. I’m gonna go ahead get thankyou advice! long gets airport employees, hotel quarantine staff first line medical staff first, might increase barrier virus needs jump affect general population. US/UK quibble prices 

Neither EU, blind propaganda realize delays mainly due **liability clauses** pharmaceutical companies, UK USA waved away. EU hand demanded accountability. vaccines clear liability EU ones sold cost.

So paddle ""quibble prices"" narrative, UK USA waved responsibility potential damage make money back reopening economies faster

For happen need majority population vaccinated, **which EU demanded accountability big pharma**, people assured compensated case something goes wrong health due vaccination. district absolutely true, broadly state schools open 5 days week whole time. Juggling both, especially time many do, whole lot harder one many us burning online call us lazy say we're person we've already told thousands us district alone jobs come fall. they're talking about, sure not? try white America time. think Professor right cautious saw happened Brazil.

I think depends definition herd immunity. scientific definition state R less 1. Using definition India reached herd immunity mid September. say cases never rise India number outbreaks. know reproduction number changes human behaviour seasons. know immunity wain virus undergo antigenic drift. surveys show different levels immunity different communities, country, urban slums. would also imply different reproduction numbers communities.

So yes would say India reached herd immunity, changing seasons, change behaviour immune population lead outbreaks.

If talking herd immunity resulting eradication, really achieved mass vaccination possible. also included best effort clauses contract though. long astrazeneca reasonable best effort okay. 
The EU negotiate well here. see they're trying shift blame astrazeneca, mostly fault. 
They even admitted underestimated difficult would build supply chain. 
I understand wanted liability included contract given pandemic, moved lot faster astrazeneca would enough time build production capacity. 
The people making decisions EU level seem amateurs. would nice able say study found x doesn’t work. Sounds awful. multiple huge snowstorms throughout country ( parts get snow anyway) past month coming. Never said causing trend likely one many contributors CNN definitely higher standard hasn’t years. American mainstream news garbage CNN Fox tier sensationalist crap. bought price, different cartels mafias arise anarchistic capitalistic society. utopia come true novels. really think people would happily follow restrictions forever? 

The way could see if, OP’s caveat #2 states, virus mortality *dramatically* increases. Even scary “up 70%!!1!” cited SA variant still tiny, tiny number x 1.7 = still tiny number people, especially under-50 crowd. That’s enough keep people living like forever.

The world far, far riskier place thousands years, somehow society went forward. We’d acclimate increased risk Covid move forward. isn’t alternative. suggesting release made release related easing lockdown?

I'm confused exactly point suggesting data releasing amount cases, amount deaths, R number, vaccine numbers made that's whole new level conspiracy theory. vaccine owned BioNTech, German.

We need stop bleeding home first. EU signed contract based Astrazaneca production capacity expected delivery times.

The EU know would export ban UK plants, deal made 4 plants assured production 2 EU 2 UK.

The EU could ordered January 2021 care, AZ claimed could deliver doses production place it. say move vaccines UK.

So yeah, over, hope get sued ground. bad, sure got Russia then. Could maybe explain little cases falling even snow storm. 

Also bad weather also means less outdoor activity, great. 

Before snow hit hiking popular me. would imagine social activity taking place inside rather happening all. I’m ok sacrifice life away freedom. find stupid people sacrifice peoples lives “freedumb”. Serious illness covid remains very, low among young people, along it, potential permanent damage “long covid”. seen zero quality evidence says otherwise. uses chimpanzee cold virus deliver DNA protects spike protein. use chimp virus, body develops immunity cannot reused. mRNA use delivery vector boosters easier Good, hopefully you’ll stop worthless druggie soon! age 60 roughly cut people 1% chance dying (according recent info could find), assuming that's correct (and think bit high) UK variant chance would mean roughly 57 year old would 1% chance dying. 

55 years - 0.4% (regular)

55 years - 0.68% (UK)

so yeah still big worry unless age range website that? Alright, fine. Keep mask mandates right now. get point fully vaccinated actively decided so, face condoms must go completely. Hell, might able ditch time, cannot ubiquitous sight point. live Oregon Gov.

And say mRNA already explored EU... Like, there's whole industry R&amp;D revolving around vaccines vaccine powerhouse much benefits... Woah...

You agree all!

By way many vaccines usa uk exported far? Missouri, coming Florida. anyone data proportion 65+ vaccinated US? understanding anyone category wants vaccine least get appointment point already gotten it, wanting see close done age group makes 80% deaths. many vaccines exported US? best allies? Canada? UK? EU? You’re sad human being, seek mental help please Agreed. What's alternative: honor system? somebody think poor landlords? collapse New cases deaths occurred despite many, most, people seeing family Thanksgiving Christmas.

You’ve got backwards. enormous spike January holidays. current drop cases reflects difference current levels socialization amount seeing holidays. Kafka documentarian bought whole lotta AZ. something doses bought something like 400M doses. Yeah state (Ohio) Health Director, Amy Acton, got lot heat early March April things beginning saying likely known cases thousand time likely 10% real infections. Turns right right things chased Y'allqueda India laws saying ignore patent laws life saving medicines? hopefully manufacture lot vaccines. list currently eligible vaccine nothing indicating manufacturing industry workers eligible basis job. job-based eligibilities are: 

*- Patient-facing Healthcare Personnel*

*- ...working congregate living facility youth...and direct close contact provide in-person care residents* 

*- First responders...regularly called scene emergency give medical aid.* 

The categories purely age-based. friend must qualified basis another criterion.  UK also needs components EU seem affect asshole attitude, no, good gesture EU. Fauci keeps throwing numbers 70%, 80%, 90% vaccination, completely unrealistic point even know says it, distracts everyone practical realistic goals. Maybe thinks says 90% magically millions people decide get vaccinated case

Honestly think close turning corner. never contagious virus like spread control year much precedent. can't spread growth forever. pathetic people really don’t clue what’s coming trust corrupt goverment think vaccine took 6 months make protect oh sad One option vaccines fail: Better universal rollout tweaking monoclonal antibodies get applied automatically anyone 60 certain risk factors. vaccines fail likely monoclonal antibodies well. ""Akin lottery"" hope winning? Yeah basically. truly understand mask hatred. 

It's pretty much influence operation. privacy obsessed paranoid people sure upset thing hide face government surveillance cameras.  Bingo. Masks annoying. Long term usage straight detrimental society reasons stated. Source that, fool. I’m sure understand saying super scary Well matter what, eventually going burn anyway running people infect. took painful way get there. essentially vaccinating everyone teachers. DNR officers; school research officers. Yep, August. Well circulating outside China November 2019, position China and... also 100% culpable incompetent covering up. China. think big concern lot people regards vaccine passport implementation vaccine available all. example, travel US required vaccine right now, 5-10% people could take advantage there's nothing someone speed process getting vaccine. 

if implemented late year ""anyone wants vaccine get one"" would different Yes! bouncing back forth quarantine hard year. Moderna delivering almost nothing, Spain gotten week AZ Moderna doubt source this? whole mask thing gotten completely control. ""Where recorded worker teleworking not?""

In HR imagine, like many organizations across country right now. Simply put, regularly working in-person setting, wait.

I work college part way offered us. imagine organization one facing issue. part vaccine rolled across every state not?

CT lauded one best rollouts administrative telework staff hospitals able get vaccine yet they're priority compared others need more. Glad you. We’ve, unfortunately, lost several teachers Midwestern US Covid. Bibi far-right measure. Literally one ever called left wing.  hate them, least annoying restrictions. Eventually must also go. control data kind meaningless. Juxtapose US UK let’s see difference. it’s purpose pandemic response, totally. provides lot useful services though. course it’s soon. fools arguing otherwise. need hug man? reason emphasized pre-existing conditions, COVID alone killed them, ergo risk general population that's forced wear masks inhibit development facial recognition/communication. moms teacher denied shot NJ they’re hybrid she’s school students M-F least 4 hours. I’m thinking lot teachers getting lying medical conditions qualify 😩. understand logic behind it, fills rage smokers put people schools. can. Indiana same. Restaurant workers, too, we’ve open full capacity since May. It’s absurd. Don’t worry, though, school resource officers given priority somehow virus doesn’t stop school them. First off, said SPOILED doses, poisoned doses. Big difference, see like warp reality desire. 

Second, I'm saying ""they would"" give - meaning, they're capable it. anyone followed Israeli abuses Palestinians last many decades know that, indeed, *capable* it. Warp reality however like, way is. not? WHO's collaboration China continue. I’m looking see drug addicted loser nothing play video games, relies tax dollars stimulus And? drop ocean EUs budget. Say $20/vaccine, EU would give away 1million would still $20 million, single Eurofighter plane $100 million. difficult following guidelines? always choice. 
Just need get point mask 0 AZ spike protein covid engineered onto adenovirus monkeys. vector viral vaccine really traditional vaccines people think think say influenza childhood vaccines usually killed weakened viruses bacteria (or parts bacteria). can't give covid. flu infect people elephants? Donald Trump right. general, outside US, political scale leans left. country's right wing basically left left-center US look policies. saying every single kid ever died flu? COVID less severe flu children. Unless saying kids social distance wear masks rest lives?
   risk complications healthy children higher flu compared COVID-19. However, infants children underlying medical conditions increased risk flu COVID-19.
   Would great people would actually get them. Vaccination terribly slow Mexico might well non existent.

If could go border get shot would. OK, agree least headed better path 5 weeks ago. Well nice thing many vaccines targeting feature ( spike ) one parts actually make infectious. part mutates much virus likely less virulent. 

Also, MRNA vaccines rapidly updated needed take account virus mutations.

There reasons still cautious concerned let fear rule mind here. Reported cases dropped like rock day Biden became president. coincidence, sure. may true, key words stuck around background seasonal flu.

Same case this. Spanish flu became seasonal thing people stopped wearing masks distancing. COVID work way. People go around wearing masks distancing Roaring 20's. Fucking Americans god damned ""preexisting conditions."" Y'all realize country world uses exscue right? read past first headline, Sanofi also developing mRNA vaccine. using production plants built year Sanofi's mRNA candidate. Converting mRNA vaccine line different mRNA vaccine line easy. Converting attenuated virus vaccine line mRNA vaccine line not.

Likewise, Novartis exploring RNA technology cancer treatment years now. production line likely going use existing mRNA research small scale production equipment. point still stands expensive time consuming part setting new mRNA vaccine production lines RNA specific equipment. existing facility equipment yet, main thing save retrofitting instead building scratch cross-train workers instead training scratch.  state even started 65+ yet, let alone teachers that. last question: still asymptomatic spread, would really matter virus killed host? already spread next person.

Also, I'd say require intelligent design. three options: 1. Less deadly, 2. change, 3. deadly. impossible third option happens, spreads higher risk we'll see mutations, whether good bad. might totally help, know schools across United States Canada planning Q3 covid exist. know schools Canada even considered abroad study classes. However, I'm told none set stone alot plans rely hope whether covid rates globally die time Q3 comes around. think general consensus requiring vaccines international travel decision country, annoying, insurmountable hurdle (eventually vaccine availability widespread). ton precedent this, all. thing schools workplaces requiring vaccines.

I think lot worry around requiring ""vaccine passports"" thinking may needed things like concerts, sporting events, businesses, etc. That's becomes grey area - there's precedent that. Private business require things use businesses, think medical info ever part US. personally see happening US, empathize concern.

I understand people want everyone vaccinated, please remember making something mandatory make skeptical person likely take it. would probably create black market vaccine cards shit. That's extrapolating steps ahead though. That's correct. co-owned. BioNTech supplied candidate vaccines Pfizer lab clinical testing. They're jointly marketing care less nationalist angle precise say read “man gets 800000 vaccine doses” thoroughly confused moment Basically this. Canada also ordered 9 doses per citizen wide array companies know made deals would approved first. overflow doses countries can't afford them. probably case (to lesser extent per capita doses) many countries. takes time implement solutions integrate current platforms. It’s airlines; it’s medical industry, it’s employers, border controls, it’s getting travelers comfortable technology. Waiting vaccines widespread trying rush point, bit silly. Public health devolved matter Scotland Wales distinct NHS England. Scottish Welsh governments responsible administration health service respective countries, whereas British government oversees England’s health service. headline skynew.com.au says Nancy Pelosi conspired Nov 6 riot/coup guess trying get people kill her? going stoop posting kidnapped aliens next? 

This skynews.com.au drivel belong here. That’s plan too. Virginia family New York haven’t met 1 year old yet. planning going week 4th July she’ll 18 months. vaccinated (if not, I’d shocked honestly) we’ll push back later July. Edited add: there’s way I’m waiting vaccinated too. infecting estimated 500 million people worldwide 1918 1919 (a third global population), H1N1 strain caused Spanish flu receded background stuck around regular seasonal flu. every often, direct descendants 1918 flu combined bird flu swine flu create powerful new pandemic strains, exactly happened 1957, 1968 2009. later flu outbreaks, created part 1918 virus, claimed millions additional lives.

Stop spouting things obviously idea about.  mean? UK USA reason speak Russian. 

We appreciate rare gesture gratitude. wish every news report like this. bullshit, facts data. thinking wrong. fact, exact opposite. selfishness led uncontrolled spread lead herd immunity. immunity bought 250000 American lives. work means really hard maintain social distancing, especially evaluations flip pages test booklet student points specific picture. wish teachers prioritized high

I mean imply SLPs, guidance counselors, etc. getting it! genuinely glad are; wish teachers included too.

As kindergarten teacher, distancing also completely impossible me, students cannot zip coats, tie shoes, open milks, plus kids deal frustration throwing masks floor. I've already exposed quarantine once; best following precautions much reasonably getting tested regularly feel safe.

I hope right much longer. right path big way must stay course right things, even receiving vaccine.

We're path carelessness some. implementation  trying figure myself. Sounds dumb, counts ""hard surface"" context? Clearly metal glass, sure. bag frozen peas? Someone would pretty hard pressed (no pun intended) call frozen bag peas ""hard surface"" microscopic perspective plastic bag packaging probably surface finish/adhesion/whatever as, say, plastic cutting board. really know TBH kinda gone ""if fluids soak in, hard surface"" defining example would - disposable shopping bag ""hard surface"" reusable shopping bag - sort surface adhesion argument, actually way verifying good idea pretty much give everything once-over disinfection low-effort peace mind thing. applies claim baseless. countless insane theories there, means possibility mask skeptics would skeptical regardless officials said considered. think least decade governments going high alert, monitoring outbreak attempting contact tracing anyone comes country sick anything. caused incredible amount damage, chance make sure doesn’t happen taken, we’ll likely see relatively extreme action taken things wouldn’t done prior pandemic- expect another major Ebola outbreak would treated differently west, example. Eventually major government damagingly overreact something turn essentially nothing, which, addition fading memory pandemic, lead governments less hyperactive NPI front. hope basic measures scientific advances enough take care new pandemic begins next time- suspicion human society already managed times. Welll, kind of: 


 Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova announced 31 percent excess mortality rate 2020 due covid-19, words 111,000 deaths. official death toll sent daily still 80,000 dead. It’s probably early get numbers death. mean say “two weeks second dose full infection” mean encounter virus point respond? Typically would develop symptoms 5 days later, could hospitalized 5 days that, progress ICU three days later may die another week that.

Someone dies Covid vaccine group right even one would probably gotten infected prior second dose. I've sub practically year never heard anyone ever say lockdown forever. first step solving problem identifying problem. People like care helping others, want sound important. logic back Febuary 2020 NZ used natural advantages sat around done nothing wait vaccine everyone said may come years? think US model thinking of.

New Zealand's original lockdown worked exactly supposed do. Incusions virus always going happen. One caused 17 day lockdown Auckland August several others contained without change restrictions. benefits Covid free within country far outweigh dealing incursions especially low numbers especially vaccine country far earlier anyone thought possible year ago. obviously. quarantine determined within 6 feet 15 minutes students tested positive. students quarantined year, though. Students quarantined sit near positive student classroom lunch. finally put students groups based know hang outside school. fully person, option virtual. one virtual student January, whole class back. normal year 21 students would feel like nice sized class. year doesn’t. large room students even 2 feet apart.

This supposed reply post. don’t know move there! I’m sorry. Yeah real goal, would obviously still transmission even high levels immunity population, mention new people born. Louis ck entered chat Russia already vaccinating anyone willing, including foreigners. America slow? grocery store worker spending 8 hours 20 teenagers room poor ventilation, they're something very, wrong. Actually you’re wrong  many deals vaccines, vaccine nationalism roadblock us getting since mainly produced EU States. Stop conservative bs Trudeau. UK US export ingredients vaccines EU.

To get high supply. words, receive vaccines them. bad faith argument. difference seeing others faces seeing others dicks. That’s says article. sort sentiment Reddit, even last spring summer. fairness UK one countries advanced strain detection reporting Anyone Netherlands know we’re expected go back normal? Seems like speed vaccinations months US/UK. one worst “news” sites I’ve ever seen. It’s clickbait bullshit old people would post Facebook ""correlation causation"" apply here. entire point medical experts healthcare authorities  people trust them. get caught lying ass lose trust. I'm sort omnipotent mind reader, can't get everyone's head. yeah, erode public trust spewing horseshit....that's bad! Furthermore, people actually died it. Probably thousands.  would base opinion anything people Twitter University employee government employee He's college football coach public university run South Carolina. College sports big time $$$ USA. Yep, it’s called logic. Idiot Phase 4 pretty much one little step way fully restored. vaccine took less 3 days make. easy modify variants.

Delete comment. wasn’t referring vaccine immunity. study involved vaccinated people revealed natural immunity lasts long time. Well, people usually saying ""mental health completely ignored face lockdowns great lasting detriment"". people called grandma killers think infection rates going actually question appears first glance. infection rate saying super high would completely agree you. decision-making calculus vaccines use changes. like would advocate Australia use AZ extremely low prevalence virus basically zero pretty much completely naive population terms immunity need high efficacy vaccine okay wait longer opinion. demanded. right. epic fail EU. right. 

But next pandemic factories EU work EU fulfilling binding contracts EU Realistically, opposite true. Masks typically banned stores hinder identification. you’re empathetic one specific type pain? makes look shitty dude. 

If break leg there’s end sight, complaining losing ability walk temporarily isn’t invalid. It’s like that. 

Someone acknowledge better others still shifty situation sad. already enough doses vaccinate every single US adult shipped April 30

Wait, source that? One word: Tory's Idk guess. He's gov employee? Looked up. Football coach? Lol. Til ~~apes~~ zombies start use guns. mask one worst. Even official story basically “I lied strategic” 

That's myth. official story regret anything said context time said it, correct. told task force meetings serious problem lack PPEs masks health providers putting harm's way every day take care sick people,"" Fauci told became clear infection could spread asymptomatic carriers know they're infected, made clear strongly recommend masks,"" also, soon became clear enough protective equipment cloth masks homemade masks good masks would buy surgical supply stores,"" Fauci added. Mask protect around you. So, yes, public people demand wear one. 


As someone service industry, tell put pants on, like big human. masks. Every time politely tell customer Mask-up (for fucks sake) pull nose, die little inside. Every time another human ask adult put mask society dies little bit. current slate leaders power, they'll go right back cutting public health funding pay corporate tax cuts. way! Guess I’m driving. That's really ridiculous statement, saying thing Novavax elsewhere. think we're going end near future Pfizer Moderna - anyone would've received Johnson Johnson Novavax April/May/June/July hang wait? 


I get mRNA vaccines scaling likely large percentage US vaccinations really see limitations ""strategy""?! many vaccinations delays timeline changes vs using get approved manufactured ASAP? many infections likely avoid using everything soon can? feel bad average landlord maybe 3-4 properties, mortgages can’t pay bills rent isn’t paid. don’t feel bad guy owns much property property taxes 120,000 per year. country? stated Sweden, I’ve made clear I’m US. luck, loved ones sacrificial lambs, then. flu pandemic every year. We've always work. 

[Kids' [number kids dropped say otherwise. Running circles faster faster mean anything productive happening. knock personally I'm sure sole person charge decision go remote. is.

Teaching kids cannot done remotely. science clear safe enough in-person schooling. held hostage special interests enough power even muzzle CDC director. It’s probably deadly it’s transmissible. contributed explanation that, reply nonsensical. left Chicago late last year. restrictions looking now? I'm empathetic people never get even moment SO, virtually not, ever again. Otherwise, said repeatedly, know hurts, ending sight, still get communicate them. Count freaking blessings. tl;dr crowd, characteristics B117 increased infectiousness death rate, E484K mutation seen escape antibodies South Africa. IMHO concerning thing seeing E484K mutation pop different strains across different countries. kind pressure put virus mutate way, well beyond random chance now. /s ? joke, right? Satire? Germany alone paid 0.5 bln. Fuck literally searched almost.. dumb I? There's difference natural immunity (your original point) vaccine induced immunity (your shifted goalpost).

T CD8+ cell response COVID-19**  appears heterogeneity immune response patients. studies reported CD8+ cells patients severe COVID-19 reduced cytokine production following vitro stimulation, shown evidence possibly exhausted cells; contrast, studies reported overaggressive CD8+ cell response highly activated CD8+ cells increased cytotoxic response patients COVID-19 \[14\].  still unclear heterogeneity CD8+ cell response relates disease features, could driven by, example, patient immunotypes \[17,19\] nature interaction respiratory epithelial cells cytotoxic cells level response.  chemokine receptor genes (including CCR9, CXCR6, XCR1) locus controlling ABO blood type identified associated severe disease; however, whether genes directly indirectly related cell responses COVID-19 remains unknown \[14\].  higher proportion CD8+ cell responses observed patients developed mild disease, suggesting potential protective role CD8+ cell responses \[11\].

Yet people seem think money fame? Makes damn sense me.

[Yeah, donate AIDS victims incompetence killed.

Giving Fauci award defending science absurd given wrote editorials directly contradicted science, leading fear panic AIDS spreads. Usually one asserts claim burned proof know. That's amazing news. 78% ton. Neither Covid 19 headline reads. lockdowns created impossible situation people victims domestic abuse... full stop. need stop arguing whether lockdowns destructive, they’re destructive, argument over. think mean plane ticket... *Can't complain kids receiving virtual instruction going vaccinate teachers.*

Fully agreed. Lets make sure 100% in-person schooling reopens second last teacher school chance get vaccinated. ifs, buts, go back old normal. award 1/9th Swinney's pay. Oh, totally agree teachers (especially littles) also hard impossible maintain distancing! I'm middile school, bit easier kids generally control bodily fluids, even constantly remind kids pull masks up. ""eradication natural infection"" common false belief among people. understand infections = mutations, horrifying death toll I’m sorry you’ve lost loved one. people however empathetic people missing SO. 

Your pain doesn’t cancel pain others. think epidemiologist types less people social behavior science, frankly public health/epidemiology types Twitter don’t exactly strike empathetic average person. exactly done help control pandemic??? Agreed. Lockdowns without police/military enforcement don’t work. People break rules there’s consequences. Even yell loudspeaker better nothing.

And US people debating mask works. 🤦‍♂️ Alright, researched it. correct, law stating exports cannot occur. false impression Trump signed Defense Production Act stop vaccines exported. They're one countries complete genome sequences COVID positive cases. They're sequencing something like 30% cases, they're going first find new variants like this. US we're sequencing something like 0.3%--no that's typo, really piddly amount. Yeah, window phase 3 trials closing quickly - hard ethically justify giving thousands placebo blind trial working vaccines already exist. remember using n95 two weeks, remember shitheads supposedly care trust public health officials actively undermine next year... go post history, I'm guessing we'll find plenty undermining trust. joke. else would prioritize teachers get back schools? Would fair vaccinate one working remotely risk, either age, health, contact w/ public? Overall message waht? guidelines clarity brought and, local healthcare centers better communication protocol panel FDA allowed preannounce anything, J&amp;J expectations approval higher 80% (there slight discussion TWIV past weekend). It'll especially useful rural mobile clinic settings outreach, Pfizer use toughest. areas vaccine compliance hardest reach, J&amp;J best single shot / easiest storage platform.

Here Arizona we're struggling get Pfizer doses anywhere state run areas; CDC preferencing Moderna counties pharmacies. CoronavirusAZ sub we're expecting next several weeks; guess J&amp;J think that's going lower risk phase 2-3 driver get shot done. probably means award lol. get agree overarching point significant housing shortage US. disagree argument landlords parasites prey tenants. know two people property getting raped right system. tenants except one two stopped paying course landlords still expected pay taxes, utilities upkeep everything else. fairness, February number cases hundreds, says ""Now, United States"" - means that...at time need overreact wear masks everywhere. clearly changed around April.

Hi second quote also true - ""it’s providing perfect protection people think is"" - 100% right too. People thinking masks protect perfectly buy bunch keep going every day, would depleted stores masks helped one bit. masks help little bit, small part solution. Distancing primary part trying drive home...

In science, go information have, change opinion information gets better. that.

I believe malice doing. Perhaps naivety assuming administration would handle things better, man working killer diseases longer us Reddit alive. get info uk allow AZ exports? ban restrictions infact UK one major Donor covax. I'm close enough 65 I'll wait get jab, join done. oppose lockdowns, demand relief expenses surprising. Remember early wave hit North America people getting turned away testing weren’t enough tests; tests weren’t reliable; criteria testing tight order conserve tests?

The reported numbers don’t necessarily make sense something nefarious, due logistics. get sick don’t bother getting tested (unless symptoms get serious need hospitalization think oh crap), official numbers don’t get reflected. housing supply artificially constrained, would need landlords.

I mean, that's simply true. Even imagined world land free, building housing costs money. We've seen various times country. There's lots places land borderline free people still rent, lot think carefully it, given artificial shortage, landlords nothing extract value time manage help sustain housing shortage. Landlords value extraction machines.

You're referring landowners group, landlords. anything, landlords, subset landowning class encourage housing creation landowners general. Landlords generally stake new housing creation. looking invest building new apartments increase supply available housing. landowners rent - incentive increase housing supply - ones constraining housing supply. shirt pants argument stupid face cannot believe it’s made good faith. Blindly saying ""correlation causation"" without contributing anything reddit moment. Yeah... basically saying : UK done they'll give remains others - altruism lol

Canada getting vaccines Europe. Well, Lonza league beneath Pfizer. Moderna like Biontech, half company, half university research institute. mask counterjerk gone pretty insane levels recently. 

Like wanting wear mask, ever wanting see them, every someone likening creepy sexual fetish. feel sad, whine it. 

People like think talking kind problem ""whining"".

No one asked read article problem care about, who's real whiner? 👍👍👍 think pandemic over, major governments world try make sure even worse pandemic never happens? 1 year restrictions areas covid fatigue max. Backlash going pro lockdown politicians they’re started ease restrictions result. Flu vaccine recommended vulnurable people. easy store mandatory get enough ill people. Also flu vaccine never marketed saying eradicate virus. prevents dying know. example coronavirus vaccine protect us year, everybody stop something we'll focus create vaccine every year. need lot money this, also need money store it. every country capable storing vaccine. also know much virus stronger it'll continue infect us. People comparing polio vaccine find weird. Polio vaccine eradicating virus, really easy create labs. know, patented. People continuing live lives see potential outbreak, using vaccine. case current vaccine. Way early say that. many variables there's point guessing.

We know need do. Mask social distance, get damn vaccine turn. We'll beat thing sooner later. Yeah, Asians Canadians know Canadians ignorant hell too. Seriously though, worry people like might stir fights people reason ethnicities.. throwing ring, discussion's sake:

another benefit mass vaccination also reducing original ""% expected get sick"" value long-run, well (Post-intervention, persons became fully vaccinated).

Using example above: Lets say new ""%expected get infected"" value 50 100k. 

50 * .05 = 2.5ppl 100k becoming ill.

So compounding benefit gained every additional cohort receives vaccine. ""We still causal explanations. know India nation far herd immunity,"" says Bhramar Mukherjee, professor biostatistics epidemiology University Michigan closely tracking pandemic. Herd immunity happens large portion community becomes immune disease vaccination mass spread disease.

...

There region country deemed attained herd immunity, though small pockets may exist,"" Dr K Srinath Reddy But... England high risk country? Schools closed 2.5 weeks ago, cases summer like 250/day. think justifies multi-million dollar upgrades suggest?

If believe windows, maybe better class open air, leave roof completely makes sense agree need follow science. odd they're holding much reserve. expect supply issues future? 20m reserved sounds like enough cover people got first dose already, even though people got first dose today. think ""just time"" model risky here, holding half doses reserve seems like may conservative.

I'm expert this, though, concerned citizen interest (and tiny bit schooling) logistics. curiosity getting here. Joke her...now dad track every move. /s wife teaching person since September. give small bottle hand sanitizer one N95 mask. going her, nice. completely making up. India 112 deaths per million, less 1/10th hardest hit countries. Even counting half deaths, absolutely impossible 500 million cases. 35% population infected might happened handful worst hit countries, ""most nations"". Trump list? nightly never going end, it? Well I'm glad okay, /u/i-eat-my-own-poop thought federal government holding onto reserve doses. Turns weren't. States reserving.

Why reserving? ensure people got first dose get second dose time. 

Keep kind trials done specific manner. know give second dose 3-4 weeks first get good result. sure wait 10 even 20 weeks like Brits things work out. delay dose regime render vaccine significantly less effective even give chance virus adapt it.

We follow science. Smallpox eradicated You’re right shouldn’t focus it’s garbage fringe position, it’s absolutely straw man—I’ve seen lot people arguing thing push absolute eradication everything short failure. They’re public health authorities politicians “important” people exist. I’ve interacted reddit person. They’re annoying, that’s people get worked it. may lying...? tf you? thought stopped reserving second doses back.. really we're doing? Why? Yeah actually getting shots arms gonna huge lift, especially live near urban area. speaking friend earlier. Many people “good” everything starting realize mental health trash it’s time something it. every state, many states people going decide socially over. think mask mandates going end slowly surely even mandates many people still don’t mask zero repercussions. without mandate, imagine still mask. Coupled advice doesn’t matter you’re fully vaccinated still see family/friends, distance, mask etc people realizing least part bullshit aren’t going comply. covered #2 :) remember videos. Here. 2021 similar 2020 Europe.

Just focus plans towards 2022. Wa wa wee wa Everyone's different, case, really hard time imagining lot potential guests comfortable dance floor they've chance get vaccinated themselves. cutting close June. people going learn hard lesson. different state, there's central authority hard get answers.

We vaccinating lot people, individuals, still tough navigate. Still preferable what’s happening US UK. hope realize developing nations used drugs ivermectin greatly reduced death rates don’t privilege use drugs cost $3k per treatment virtually nothing. developed nations blocking cheap treatments work. India includes ivermectin tons vitamins covid treatment kit covid nearly extinct India. wife spent lockdown becoming certified nurse immuniser last June - HOPE might get this. starts next week😎😎😎 Gosh, seriously hope we've 2 months... get saying, planning started well vaccines actually ready. 63000. you’re gonna come like that, least get number right every place senior center though even community center. also closed staff cut due pandemic. plenty seniors aides. can. need crank supply distribution. there’s issue many want shot can’t get won’t able quite while. husband decided delay again. originally scheduled Summer 2020, rescheduled Summer 2021, realization having, pushed Summer 2022.

We paperwork done legal marriage purposes. matter big party celebrate, want patient celebration want. think speaking realistic truth here.

My problem line reasoning (in general) friends said FIRST MONTH pandemic.

“Nothing do... can’t stay locked forever... life... people aren’t going to... etc.”

As bonus... friends talk “moving goalposts” (regarding vaccines returning normal). 

Moving goalposts? never started playing game. Eventually. 

We still beginning start end. ""if laws physics holding us back, we'd much along!"" Small studies basically worthless kill anyone even smells like whistleblower Expert clarified facts accused NewYork Times twisted said, left China-haters silent. family twice formally still Zooms out-of-town relatives occasionally. skip many possible. mean deadly per infected absolute numbers? infective even mortality rate kill people absolute numbers. Super frustrating part vaccine close state (almost elementary teachers received heavily getting last set groups). would think, awesome -- lets hold weeks get everyone vaccinated (or least first dose -- understand qualifiers). plan (return hybrid mid-March), informed last week students returning next week. 

If held mid-March date, almost every single staff member would least first dose. now, something like 70% staff returning without single dose. seems silly. Also, frustrating find subs (hard experience fall in-person) every staff member actually get appointment (because appointments weekends according state). 

If endpoint sight, I'd least understand return. frustrating close. hope works out. love Zoom meetings never want go back in-person office. second office starts discussing coming back, I’m telling supervisor don’t want to. 

That said, hate socializing Zoom passion. Zoom happy hours, game nights, karaoke, whatever...they go die fire. I’m organization Zoom meetings last two months since last 
surge. They’re planning “reassess” next month. don’t go way go plan week around it. don’t side gig (Instacart) work, go meeting, take batch going Zoom meeting day. hate Zoom there’s expectation pressure attend, whereas things person pre-COVID, people understood gave flexibility couldn’t come. ""experts musing"" major problem whole pandemic half said musings wildly innaccurate one wants focus bad things they've wrong on.

To get conclusion, make pretty wild assumptions? Namely virus would constantly evolve dangerous?

This Plague Inc....theres intelligent design behind doing, replicates sometimes replicates different....a lot differences either advantages disadvantages, meaning advantageous variants spread.

Why would massive deadly variant one preferred evolution perspective? would hamstring ability spread right?  know common sense means? double standards that. many EU countries looked wastewater? start? US look earlier samples mid 2019 found cases late 2019? come took places long analyze data? CoNvEnIeNt. 

We conclude based information first identified cases Europe. 6 months ago question people sub adamant possible are. Heightened relative baseline hospitalization rate infectious disease, think that's hard infer said. Even assume half cases asymptomatic, would put 1:200 immunologically naive 20 year olds hospital soon let tear through. risk 2x 20 year olds, tell perceive high. I'm already vaccinated, would absolutely pissed started dropping restrictions high risk, leisurely activities vaccinations available me. Absolutely, people vaccinated better, decrease infection rate Hey bot account, one accounts literally responded comment word word 😂🤣😂 know ""news"" men? Canada every province runs health care system premiers provinces love score political points telling feds stick offer help besides money. Huh far remember R number 0 September last year start wave... right original wave started. anything remove comment post removal warning. Lmaoo literally gotta hold May/June. weather gets nicer lot people get vaccinated/more people get vaccinated life returning normal I’m calling it. goal posts reason moved point. husband's district, disorganized. teachers vaccinated not. teachers vaccinated even though still teaching remotely comfortable coming classroom. husband teaching hybrid months idea he's gonna get vaccine. He's also tested twice since returning classroom (I think went back October November?). handled well IMO. selfish thinking vaccine passports government overreach?

I basically called grandma killer another sub saying shouldn’t carry ID card around 24/7 participate society, people can’t get health reasons shouldn’t carry doctor’s note wherever go. look dates, isn’t true. districts went first week feb. others second. Walnut Hills isn’t going back ALL. 

If schools zero intention adhering agreement state, shouldn’t taken shots. Period. End story. Districts hybrid full time year could taken early shots, state clearly trying target big urban districts (aka districts person education) early rounds. People higher risk dying could used shots.

And isn’t 3 weeks. Pfizer 1-2 weeks 2nd shot get 95%, that’s every teacher know gotten. pfizer protection 3 weeks first shot basically AZ shots. 

It’s utter crap. would love that. instinct someone works supply chain inventory throughput. vaccines likely go faster flu ones inventory won’t able built quickly support surges. 

All exciting problems though! Tons vaccines apparent abundance demand. Meanwhile, less 3% populated counties Michigan vaccinated. stand 6 feet apart aren’t able partner group work play together, exactly think social interaction actually happening schools? think seeing another kid 6 feet away counts social interaction??? Implications 
A) AZ useless vaccine (wrong) ineffective SA (very minimal evidence best), 
B) uk vaccinations AZ (wrong), 
C) new variants automatically require new vaccine (wrong) 
D) issue countries belief hold pfizer/moderna better vaccines mrna issues (wrong)  That's makes difference, personal hygiene. can't scrub away virus body using soap water, weird bacteria lives armpits. Yes, washing hands frequently reduce transmission, that's one way virus spread. Try triggered term ""new normal.""  Even though Allies World War II, new normal afterwards. Women joined workforce home ownership became norm due G.I. Bill widepread desire settle down. always legacy lockdown. hard predict, remote working option may become normalized, might wearing mask public West feeling sick. UBI probably closer reality. isn’t included contact tracing questions health department. ask student work healthcare. one keeping numbers teachers, point, know colleagues haven’t. anecdotally, yes. Actual data, no. suspect that’s intentional support “it’s community spread, school” mantra. mean, six months ago vaccines. think anything meaningful taken away article. general, yeah, prior post suggested case, whatever reason, seeing instances vaccine help people infected getting vaccine.

My question general question vaccines, specifically based observation. Nobody giving free pass. Covid policies creating circumstances likelihood abuse happening much higher reducing opportunities victim receive support escape. simultaneously accept criminals responsible actions also aware government policy create circumstances less likely happen. CNN ""the media?"" EU fantastic job. financed vaccine completely fucked everything else. politicians bragging 70% vaccination till end February, saying ""maybe fall"". Lol. Everything sucks. Yep, under-rated aspect, next week cold largely passed people get shots in, bump good margin. older people Looks like may able host Olympics summer all. That’s call “learning live it”.... let kill many possible. Great work! sure new variants play available illegal access.

Convenient, no? least agree can't use basis concluding Europe first? Officially think I'm woods vaccine second dose side effects. soreness redness arm, that's it. three days. ran total 26 miles days too. think downsizing offices hybrid approach way go.

Most people working established teams, relationships built office. started new job since March 2020, tougher make connections people.

And everyone's home situation different. separate home office like working home anyone whose ""office"" bedroom, kitchen table extra room. hit 3M/day flu shots peak administration times, near massive push currently covid vaccines. Especially J&amp;J hits, pretty easily hit 3M/day march sometime. ""binding"" contracts fact export ban.

I think, next time, last pandemic Earth, everybody gets fire back, EU country sign binding contracts. They’re already producing much vaccine spike Indianna teachers getting sick covid since opening August? starts narratives?

It’s snowball effect: one person starts talking people people people narrative enough air people arguing it.

Some examples are: masks work? Hydrochloroquine. new normal food. Reopen protests.

The point sow chaos. know Russia others it, know target forums like Reddit. much anyone’s guess. Serum Institute India started producing AstraZeneca vaccine last July. took huge gamble vaccine would actually work eventually approved foe use. gamble paid massive head start countries terms production. know live USA already imported variants developed similar variants own. 

Look convergent evolution. south African strain unique simply took natural evolutionary path adapt better attach human cells. UK, SA CA strains followed similar path could happen country well even SA strain kept out. Unlike mRNA, AZ vector can't reused updated vector longer available. soon practical, I'm going take zoom burn back yard! kids going die, they're much likely die (or get really sick) flu pneumonia given years (or statistically accident somewhere). talking Thea Fischer. Nice jump strawman though... biggest question is: get go public without mask? problem wearing mask wear 2 go out, say miss seeing people’s faces most. quote me? noticed reason act like 21% people previous exposure anti bodies makes 0 difference transmission rate. say ""no close heard immunity""

Which would false. Yet virus 20% infectious told endlessly nightmare is. SA chose stop using it, based small study done. study showed AZ vaccine prevent transmission virus, no-one study required hospitalisation died. study didn't, however, include older adults, research needed. currently, younger adults balance AZ vaccine still beneficial. countries covid strain SA mutation, proven effective preventing transmission illness. feel like Karikó owed Nobel prize basic science behind vaccines take life back normal. boss said managers, largely dictate kind telework/at office dynamic pandemic over. thinking team roughly 50/50 mix keep everything fresh. definitely benefits downsides each.

Once ""news"" becomes commodity that's sold hot new show HBO, rapidly loses credibility. Police? Neighbors? Churches? Neighbourhood watches? Family? Friends? states, lottery everyone. 65+ high risk people vaccinated, still going problems. people get vaccinated better, sure. that's likely people let guard down, despite restrictions, high risk individuals still vaccinated. much mink evidence, scientists conducted virus origin investigation mink? lot us, know limit.

We prefer limit safely.....we accept getting limit point safe to. Statewide blood testing COVID-19 found 2% Virginians antibodies virus mid-August 2020. prompted UVA researchers conclude herd immunity Virginia “currently plausible means ending COVID-19 2.8 times Virginians antibodies identified state’s PCR testing, according UVA researchers. ratio lower many estimates predicting much country’s population may already COVID-19 antibodies.

Welp, this’ll fun thought people going get spread it, well, got spread it. can't get again. things good moderation. 11 months Zoom Zoom done moderation. longer vaccination EU lasts, less want donate poor people poor countries. Q2 EU able vaccinate around 50% people(roughly 450m dose), would protest form donating. 

To donate, earn. locked economy earning possible. Period working fine whole last year. perfect example endless lockdowns demanded Reddit viable policy. Alongside increased domestic/sexual abuse we’re seeing vast increases anxiety, depression, alcoholism, many children falling behind education point never catch up, children self harming, businesses failing, job losses, ultimately removal majority things make life actually worth living people. gets worse day vaccine rollout progressives argument preferable Covid become increasingly unconvincing. Yeah. Take odds piece equipment we’ve sent orbit experienced failure. 

A 1 999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999 chance still possibility. Abusers reason rates going up. choose inflict harm families. choice get help (therapy, medication, healing trauma, etc.). abusers don’t get free pass COVID.  “Sorry babe, know stressed COVID!” UK manufacture AZ moment, production initially slow. UK used AZ, it'd third total vaccinations. literally unsustainable OP's 2nd option comes pass, understand right? vaccines chasing virus forever, essentially wait less fatal us develop treatments.

That'd require years distancing shutting industries....yeah global depression probably great addon shit basket COVID. Government country? smoked weed really long time, promise. I'm high, really. 

There seem lower demand testing now, agree idea may fewer things making people test right now. days lower testing numbers, positivity shoot up? Like, people really need tested, see much higher positivity? convinced idea while, mostly numbers Illinois, switched while. 

I really thought positivity rate *the* metric watch, seems like sideways indicator. believe many scientists predicted virus would become less deadly evolves. happened virus? UK, US number cases? joking wife sort this. like 11 months real thing US, getting infected NOW? made 11 months, clearly believe covid real, otherwise probably would infected before. go far, close mass vaccination, get infected? drove whole Nebraska get gay married Council Bluffs, IA. hours seeing corn, corn, corn, corn, dead corn, corn, soybeans!, corn, corn, corn, corn... etc. US massive comorbidity issues beyond age. ""you people"" doctors nurses thread sick tire PEOPLE! guy well known EU propoganda poster. hope they're passionate nationalist actually paid influence opinions.

 Even thread ""pretend"" find US UK received vaccines Europe knew already. comment existed pretend outraged. continue posting misinformation export bans rubbishing non eu vaccines. People told user there's export ban. keep writing insinuate UK US behaving evilly.

You always spot EU nationalists refuse even call pfizer vaccine. must Biontech..

Horrible vaccine situation overtaken nationalism geopoliticng Abusers reason rates going up. choose inflict harm families. choice get help (therapy, medication, healing trauma, etc.). abusers don’t get free pass COVID.  “Sorry babe, know stressed COVID!” Oh give fucking break. sick people refuse acknowledge pandemic eleven months this. Seriously, I'm done death cultists.  Sorry New Zealand one said that. Also mutants 1000s times yes. mutations nothing note  US UK EU domestic vaccination production.

We received 1,200,000 doses.

Gibraltar received 24,000 really ? think massive disparity failing bad. 

Bahrain 242,000 doses

Seychelles received whopping 51,000 doses.

Maldives another whopping 25,000

Chile received 1,900,000 right us beat. lot probably long.

Serbia 900,000 doses 

Israel rock star sure UAE term doeses received percentage populations vaccinated 5 million plus hell perhaps willing pay offer data pharmaceutical companies get first priority countries not. 

What countries common ? way less population Canada. ya easier get high percentages population vaccinated. still near top list numbers vaccines received hell beating Russia bit slow sin delivery's.

We far back line. ""Pandemic 2024!"" realize 50% hospitalized 65, right. need source that?  cares? viruses mutating news you, probably lock basement rest time  think able handle 3 zoom parties said bye bye Clearly none ever travelled somewhere need proof yellow fever vaccination lol. thing long time various diseases throughout history way back February 2020 wrote lancet, much less known virus. quickly strongly came call conspiracy theory suspicious retrospect. several peer reviewed journal papers since point Washing hands great all, going hand washes problem. Open door, inadvertently touch face... number possibilities. paranoid shown little significance transmission. transmissible contact, well... sigh. asymptomatic infection?
what transmission?
how vaccine perform? fact vaccinated less 3k people last 4 days combined, government joke can't believe many people praise best could happened México. Imagine listen Osterholm. 😬 thinking rationally. worry continue plans. literally put card wallet already carry every time leave house... already I'm proud got vaccinated. Literally zero effort. Forget even wallet. imagine comment going grain thread, worker's compensation designed pay something like covid-19. meant workplace injuries, global pandemic spreading everywhere.

Most tens millions people U.S. gotten covid-19 could claim get work, would way anyone know. would bankrupt worker's comp, meant this. **no** clue caused spike cases El Paso October/November, would curious find **if** could variant. holiday spike could attributed Labor Day. said another comment, weeks ago media blasting China blocking investigators even getting in. turned administrative/visa issues, course media allow reach front page.

Other members team notably said cooperative investigation. important look full story jump conclusions, lesson I'd say us sub since beginning aware of. Thank terror, thank disillusionment. Answer Question. Moderna produces EU exports countries. Declaration Independence let terrify you. There's nothing wrong cautious still things optimistic about. get vaccines arms US residents every day, current US approved vaccines appear effective UK strain. actually done though? think he's really changed much anything. Yeah, friends teachers DC area, VA MD vaccinating teachers. matter book appointment though, scheduling huge fiasco that's individuals figure out, local health departments.

I live CA teachers eligible vaccinated, there's supply go around depending county in. also much info people have. texted friends, eligible get vaccine know following news closely (obsessively lol) me. ridiculous disorganized vaccine distribution is. know that, seems like people keep moving goalposts stop, saying ""several months"" etc. We're getting vaccines along plenty already got virus, summer. Dude, whole profile dedicated pushing pro-China narrative - even defending treatment people who've (temporarily) disappeared government. Quick question (turing test shills) happened Beijing Jun 4, 1989

Dude, profile four years old, regularly post r/birdstakingthetrain r/WanderingInn r/Undertale. want talk Tiananmen, I'm it. I'd rather talk subject hand rather trying suss Chinese spy handwaive arguments? haven’t heard anything government mandating I’m seeing news media talk we’re getting closer vaccine available general population, makes think it’s coming. ""people live long"" supposed think life expectancy? Tajjksh? don’t think case think people working healthcare really excuse Yep. Got buddy caught December. Super cautious works school athletic trainer. thinks got student treated Friday night game tested positive Monday. following Friday feeling like shit. 

Yet spent night girlfriend Wednesday started feeling bit sick / coughing... fine. Didn’t even test positive let alone show symptoms. 

It’s bizarre. You’re point wrong, also accounting good politics this. conclusions would make sense vaccine delivery random. highly concentrated age group. look data age group see differences. make health authorities going approve without trial cloud anti-vector immunity ?

There better options contend all. Novovax probably best bet since technology already used vaccinate multiple strains HPV once. mRNA approaches obviously deal all. expect two platforms speed approval main sources booster shots. Dude. Get thick skull. virus large mostly lethal people nursing homes doesnt justify locking entire population world inside year. losing someone close doesn’t justify damage lockdown inflicts rest society innumerable ways. extremely selfish everyone else starting realize it. world doesn’t revolve around doesn’t revolve around people risk complications covid. Deal it. ""WHO: COVID-19 didn’t leak lab. Also WHO: Maybe did"" -- Bulletin Atomic source level headed discussion possibility lab leak? See comment hits -50 Whoever tagged Good News ashamed supporting tyranny. Maybe true.  I'm saying Chinese government obfuscation blatant lying made things worse. afford vaccines. talking vaccine becomes generally available. People defensive now. asked right guy you’re ere replying shocking me, know better. yet another example lockdowns COVID restrictions done much harm general population good. I'm guessing testing missing new variant. We'll find soon hopefully. typed full, automoderator deleted submit asterix, tr*mp supporter American friend. government proposed this? cat well bag Chinese detected virus. People around globe around Dec. even Nov. would want import UK instead accepting technology transfer produce domestically ? I'm Chile. received 4 millions doses Chinese Sinovac vaccines (2 millions already vaccinated 10% population). Six millions way, got 40 thousands Pfizer far zero AZ, despite contracts. Peru received 600 thousand doses Sinopharm, Argentina million Sputnik. Brazil vaccinated 4 millions Sinovac (still drop ocean). Bolivia got 300 thousands Russia, similar numbers got Venezuela. Etc.

This hard data, easily verifiable. EU exporting vaccines massive scale, responsible 70% global vaccine production.

Source please. yet.

They ever case. I'm looking information antibodies protect south african mutation cell response that's ineffective. both. info this? unfortunate son ... Let guard one minute ... Perhaps does. pedantically correcting random person internet's ""mistake"". willing take vaccine carry around passport 24/7 two different things. enough people reach herd immunity, masks, social distancing, travel restrictions out. Period. someone ACTUALLY disease, might something there. fuck no, get punish everyone MIGHT it. lockdowns restrictions crap. 

And yes, absolutely believe people's human rights important safety. 110%. No, human rights limits. disgusting viewpoint, dumbass meme sound argument. Buy dose, donate dose. standard start. government actually talking implementing something like everyday life? 

I always assumed people talking meant international travel private functions. Labeled good news lmao, okay guys Rabies tetanus much longer incubation times obvious indicators tell someone seek medical attention. probably right lot people hitting window, thats likely luck anything intentional. people waking up. Shills Corona game through!

Cause answer toooo

Vaccines! Fuck yeah! Comin save motherfuckin day yeah! Ooooooh. understand now. dumb. Well person lied forms. clear NY eligible. young people sacrificing teenagers. late 20s/30s/early 40s almost risk virus plenty financial responsibility. 60+ year olds. I'm asking get vaccine first. I'm asking people realize group selfless actions pandemic selfish old people fucking grateful. Really. serious game now. Steering conversation China’s handling allowing access critical data back EU US practices textbook whataboutism. Well, somewhat selfish. People refuse take vaccines know better science harming rest us. vaccine passport really different demanding someone license drive. 

That said, required “everything” - course not. movies, sports, air travel, concerts, etc - hell yes demand people take vaccines. Splintered level? Canada essentially entirely different system province. NHS splintered way think could call ""N"" HS. hiding behind anything. even remotely binding EU knows otherwise would taking legal action. aren't.

They **yet**. Let's wait blows see go, lot people die criminal act, think go unnoticed. Somehow public release contract, production AZ improved! UK 0 vaccine production facilities 18 months ago. 3 operational 2 built.

And EU exporting vaccines massive scale, responsible 70% global vaccine production. get point, Pfizer closed operations Europe export controls? Also, comparing production AZ vaccine mRNA vaccines? Except he's not.


It resistant, fear mongering. Yes execution ""quarantine facilities"" abysmal many places. Slovakia, people reported put rooms strangers due lack space etc... 

A ""makeshift facility like sports stadium"" perfect place spread virus. amount mask wearing effect one enclosed volume hundreds people. US export Pfizer. EU production bottleneck, that's hear small amounts. relevant creating chaos? US quite bad tell, therefore, go first. going somewhere: ""because poor"" calculating likelihood reinfection Exactly.

Neighbours, friends family can't meet. Church closed. forgot school well. Police busy really important stuff enforcing curfews checking one picnicking park. Thanks helping explain point Asking evidence claims “scientists bad”

Indeed, asking evidence claims science know, Oxford &amp; AstraZeneca think otherwise. Thanks clarification!  Maybe cat well bag time warning. 

That could different. Calling things whataboutism apply even worse. typing word Trump scary you? pathetic you? I’m person X still haven’t caught covid. *shrug* life’s fair, guess. headline redundant enough. Try this: Turkey detects new, previously unknown, unique, never seen mutation first time"" Whether deadly not, difference must negligible. existed since least September UK massive change number deaths. Oh one: get fucking vaccine rolled faster. many super rich countries list? That's happens *coronavirus* discussed r/thebachelor lol wtf going Part reason emphasis elderly ones filling hospitals. needs easing healthcare system regroup. Another surge soon could catastrophic. think depend live. absolutely places country run people vaccinate long then, places like NYC may take little longer. say June 30th, well believe correct. However, aspect China's history would ever make anything say believable? Particularly relating finance, science, disease management. 

I apologize, extreme control information, suppression criticism, lax standards shown time time (construction, food management, healthcare delivery etc), reinforce providing fulsome information. 

Again, questioning, theorizing conspiracy completely unreasonable - thing I'm postulating occrred west, multiple times, far deadlier pathogens. 

When run regime absolutely allow questioning position - outcome going get. Except does. Hiding behind ""best effort"" fulfilling doses countries best effort, taking sides.

There's hiding behind anything. even remotely binding EU knows otherwise would taking legal action. Sure would, easy build shack made tin foil barrel start cook vaccines, right? need specialized equipment qualified labor - hell could hire cooks make vaccines!

The UK 0 vaccine production facilities 18 months ago. 3 operational 2 built. family ever sort backlash Trump crowd? someone telling ""go back came from""? feel that? perhaps tell Modi produces pretty much crowds. plan continue quarantine vaccinated, know transmission decreased vaccinated. It’s still based luck. I’m risk, I’m taking extreme precautions. I’ve pretty careful, indoor dining anything stupid like that, still go inside grocery stores weekly, go restaurants grab takeout every weeks. chances getting infected times pretty low, certainly zero, even mask attempting avoid wearing chin diapers course vaccine enough. vaccine + immunity previous infection certainly helping. desparation There's going AZ booster. unproven anti-vector immunity problem adenovirus based vaccines. thing JandJ Sputnik. set contracts time. might child-like understanding business mean that's way world works.  
 
If EU said ""you produce ordered here"" companies would've set somewhere else. gained EU vaccines, order time. Simple. it’s dirty word one wants say. “Partial Herd Immunity”

Those going taking precautions likely gotten point stopped spreading among others going out. Coupled vaccination nursing homes. Whenever hear ""Zoom X"" ""Virtual Y"" cringe. course. That's cornerstone fuck fuck ups built upon. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Unless you’re China vaccines don’t work, wait another vaccine? then, one eventually becomes ineffective... you’re talking locking forever play Whack-A-Mole. 

Do really think people happily stay home, never return work, school, restaurants, bars, concerts, sporting events, travel, etc., etc. that? No. Good Literally NY Times: Croda one suppliers.

That’s suspicious impedes efforts identify patient zero. ""The trusted name news"" CNN accurate ""fair balanced"" FOX. Well pfizer moderna vaccines bought directly manufacturing companies. 
India supplying Oxford /AstraZeneca manufactured Serum Institute India branded “Covishield” 
This vaccine diplomacy result foreign policy commitments licensing Oxford/AstraZeneca Except clear evidence cover up. China clearly trying cover stuff year (we saw last winter). nothing hide would gone lengths conceal situation? many previous False articles saying variants won’t problem need worry, variants won’t become deadly transmissible etc. it’s unlikely even though hundreds thousands mutations last year great news. Mexican media they're making look like vaccination fiasco government blame ""not buying"" vaccines time. enough go around. 100 countries ZERO vaccines far. would expect us export hundreds millions vaccines starting early summer. 

We haven’t even vaccinated elderly yet. live Delhi people wear masks driving using public transport. Everywhere else one wears masks all
 Yet cases freefall

Those businesses Zoom, Peloton Bowflex. rising state ahead rest country 2020. March June mark starts new seasons, India needs careful months. AZ breaching contract EU. contract specifies ""reasonable best efforts"", require breach prior contract UK. contract specify UK factories used fulfil it. Quite reverse: makes clear EU wanted EU vaccines produced EU. also makes clear AZ cared distribution world-wide, EU understood sole priority.

Bottom line AZ breach contract, they'd sued, happening. EU know they'd lose.

This UK. UK stopping anyone making vaccine exporting it. export ban. making sure specific vaccines bought paid for, belong them, stay country use citizens. property rights export bans. isn’t surprising all.

And cut stupid shit end. Go live somewhere ""freedumb"" let know is. ""anti masker"" per se answer question... studies like this. studies masks really studies anecdotes like one published article said BLM protests lead spike cases everyone wearing masks, scientific. mom moderna aa well. issue. Feel better. said drinking lots water helped. sister NJ teacher got shot already. Experts:   
Don,t wear masks... Un wait ...    
It's transmissible ... Um, well actually is...   
It's airborne ... D'oh!  would EU give advance warning going block exports? That’s exactly USA UK (not UK blocking exports) would EU same? It’s USA UK face outrage various companies could plan around original question. choose implement export bans notice you’re going face backpack. add trying torch GFA without even informing RoI it’s going get pretty large.
Are childish think informing companies somehow beneath you’d rather countries acted petty manner screw companies reason?

It wasn’t cause delay yes part it. Got proof due liability vaccines cost impact? Either way it’s irrelevant though didn’t feel need list causes. EU delayed signing contracts, delayed AZ setting factories led reduction available vaccines. Reasons EU delaying them, outcome delays. Correct. like Florida nearly whole time. keep hearing people say can't isolating thing anymore etc guess reality altered Florida. life pretty much back normal here. Come Friday night every restaurant, bar, etc packed. They’ve talking months now. vaccines rolled out. need hurry agree global standard companies implement it. Lockdowns places meant takeout, starbucks, leaving visit friends, etc. Essential literally meant things keep alive, like grocery stores pharmacies limits could go those. think anywhere US came close lockdowns China places Europe. parents adults, make decisions risks willing accept. think read big reason India supply manufactured far surpassed distribution abilities, would take time work - manufacture vaccine.

I could wrong, authority subject.  Bye Bye Forever Zoom parties anyone?  Thank god. house quarantining nearly month two separate instances coming contact positive case. Finally got cleared PCR today disruption life... would take mild annoyance, please. Curious would look charge $300 per test specifically prescribed doctor. mask usage fantastic, expected since masks new concept them, havent taken measures. sure hope Lol, anyone thinks China ever, now, ever tell truth idiot Gottlieb interesting bit interview. Say variants double prevalence every week pretty fast. start 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.4%, etc. actually takes 6-7 weeks get 10%. current pace vaccinations that's something like 60-70 million shots given lot. words, we're winning race currently pace vaccinations. do. It’s called living Florida. self-published study, headline boils one piece evidence: Eighty-four percent remote students reported exhaustion, headaches, insomnia stress-related ailments, compared 82 percent students classroom days 78 percent students classroom full time. Careful now, criticising Daniel means secret agent Merducks council.  fairly sure mortality rates gone elsewhere advancements illness managed. that's true, rate staying UK despite gains would sign variant deadly. see there.

Hope you’re right. hope that's true, making lot assumptions here. new paths infection, things opening up, there's nothing say burn infection cycles. naive population might larger think. bothers term real world. know common terminology field. see trials ""real world"". found statements release regional health authorities media also ProMED regularly read local office China. playing semantics. would say cause rise domestic violence, pandemic / lockdowns? guys makes shit fly. He’s addicted lights. I’ve saying since started get voted every time...

Not compromised also straight useless, publish articles stating fucking obvious usually weeks everyone else. give enhanced unemployment normal unemployment USA generally 50% unemployment first world nations current enhanced unemployment probably full wage replacement right now.

The stimulus bribe honestly fuck I'm cool it. Want put life hold year? Fine, cut checks. 'feel' there's good reason true? understand concept provide evidence claim?

I definitive perspective follows; data currently substantial enough determine higher rate mortality Kent variant. citing study pretense proves incorrect, doesn't, co-author stated data insufficient make conclusion currently requires investigation. makes Fauci's (which original point) claims unsubstantial.

This means must wait research done matter proper conclusion made topic variant's mortality rate. Says asymptomatic spreader ... due respect, I've there, done that.

How sad No? ridiculous say something's false proven. someone cancer that's yet diagnosed, would say they're cancer free? Obviously making conclusions little data irresponsible.

Do jack shit reading comprehension intentionally straw manning? I've never said deadly. pointed data suggest is, response incorrectly said otherwise. definitely is, there's literally data one way other, wont know analysis complete. Oh yeah 100% agree. totally thought N95s finally caught that's news me. I'm amazed thankful this, also frustrated reported media. heard new high every day way up, we're back 3-4 months ago silence. good news folks?

Agree almost points, also keep mind overlap vaccinated previously infected. drop total immune bit PARENTS KEEP EATING INDOORS, tell there's like 5% chance getting disease inside restaurant, someone please send study get stop going out, can't find legitimist ones quick search mind linking study would love read It. expect vaccine activate strong response immune system

Ok even phase 1 trials yet. Definitely going need source analysis. buy Retin-a latisse India. Good stuff. don’t believe networks fake news reports sometimes? couldn’t imagine default belief journalist tells something, it’s true. curious see this. current groups something like 20% population. open another 50% (i.e. remaining eligible adults) obviously 2-3 times hard get appointment.

I old enough remember 1970's rationed gasoline based last letter/digit license plate. Wonder try something like that. Absent significant increase doses, people wait.

However, J&amp;J vaccine ships saying, would change everything. would nearly double number doses available, J&amp;J vaccine requires one shot. would make vaccine available pharmacies strip malls country. get NJ vaccine wherever want. friends’ parents got AC live Hunterdon County. OP posts several times day imaginary “people” get them, force wear mask die, force live restrictions forever ever. It’s whiny overly dramatic. 

I get frustrated, thread getting extremely victim-complexy. used subscribe pretty hard, since get frustrated, eventually realized there’s grand conspiracy keep us miserable. pandemic end, probably year. need suck deal awhile longer. “People” conspiring make pandemic last forever. Yes, antibodies, encouraging, unfortunately data definitively say whether protected reinfection (especially new viral variants emerging) long immunity last. Sorry can't give definitive answer. kinds answers take years solidify. actually really like idea remote work flexibility, want obliterate idea office business culture. Nah. We're still here. also freaked parties Lightening Stanley Cup. I’m sure infections total meltdown... Nothing variant variant except continue effective: Vaccinate People. struck deal Chinese put almost eggs one basket. know basket Canada good terms extradition Chinese employee Huawei US detained small group Canadians well. Wouldn’t know it, Chinese reneged deal. Fucking obviously... progressive thought making individuals pay shot outrageous... economy fall apart faster anyone else’s, right front eyes, locks downs. strong immune response tetanus booster vaccine. Knocked full day. EU, Curevac approved.

Eventually. absolutely true! Arizona teacher - getting second dose today. would prove nothing sort. Cases falling cold weather, still falling now.  fair...you worry much. remark must clarified. notable varients (discovered UK, SA, Brazil) having/had effect infection rates India know of? what's sub going full 'scientists bad'? like we're coming 500000 confirmed deaths US still winter anything. 

The absolute selfishness it, vaccines deployed, end sight, people would rather get many infected over. see problem. Currently Pfizer extent Moderna mainly used vaccinate elderly, AstraZeneca given medical personnel. high-priority groups like vaccine doses wasted.

While AZ's vaccine likely provide good protection elderly well, data arguably weak currently hurt take safe approach. hopeful US fairly well vaccinated end summer time politically possible push vaccines countries. right, 440 million Europeans shat US summer long.

Anyway, US banned vaccine exports EU supplying distant places like, uh, Canada. go tell _them_ shove it? Yeah, here's one: Ending lockdown. mean Cartel received 800000 vaccines. real heroe comment section... way dealt Covid changed minds causes much mistrust? 
I doubting you, interested perceived outside media. UK restricted exports middlemen destined resale.

The reason we're exporting vaccines bought UK production. another country done first we'd exporting (and feeling silly). still little concerned two children, one aged 5 12. Neither get vaccinated. assuming herd immunity actually kick work(so many conflicting reports still negative full doom gloom). know concept herd immunity works, unable immunized pertussis lived. goal immunize 70% total population hitting adults? want able take kids museum feel like gonna die. premise improved behavior driving cases down. may play factor - know got little less comfortable going store groceries reverted pickup third spike. Plus we're past holiday surge. hard believe that's it. I'd add partial herd effects 30% prior infection, modest effect 5% adult population fully vaccinated (two shots), maybe seasonality. twitter thread, can't post it, Michael Mina interesting comparisons seasonality CoVs concludes maybe fall primetime annually Sars-CoV-2. Whatever is, hope keeps going. 
I agree posters ""summer"" pessimistic wide availability - I'd put May J&amp;J coming line Novavax next up. like think truth Pfizer Moderna decided upon two-dose regimen testing data collected. think tested single dose. think assumptions two doses better one would boost efficacy duration I'm sure assumptions tested.

If look carefully data, efficacy one shot 90%+ higher, one explanation.

So well may one dose enough excellent efficacy mean going change anything, stick what's tested. bad would obviously enormous benefits could stick one dose, vaccination would go twice fast. reduces us cattle one suggested otherwise. fact always plan. going export/ donate vaccines US's population vaccinated.

Anyways sorry :) population Wyoming many died covid US mean BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine. That's mostly produced EU. exported EU. Fully developed EU. Mostly funded EU members. bought EU. truly American vaccine Pfizer later partnered expertise vaccine developer released market produced ASAP. Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine production mostly located EU. development done American company, like stated.

Moderna, that's fully American vaccine. Pfizer/BioNTech almost entirely EU (or German) vaccine.

But maybe even important: wtf matter. Vaccine nationalism stupid. brought point, corrected. Amen.

...

""2 masks common sense"" - Dr Anthony Fauci thought every single percent non effectiveness vaccination immunity disorder get immunized even virus otherwise mechanism make sense me.  China ultimately gain covering up? wait that? That's crux here- probably wait April fine. seems unnecessary right spend millions plexiglass, cleaners theatre, scrambling guess find another building find teachers make classes smaller. Nah, pretty sure covered scenario #2 absolutely get panicked mutations article shitty. 

That said, variant mutation vaccines tested (L452R). early paper coronavirus identified L452R mutation one dodged antibodies. 

Source: even rate shots going out? We’ve got huge percentage must vulnerable vaccinated. Maybe we’ll case hotspots. doubt we’ll see anything even close death saw around holidays 1/13th population, 1/960th infections.

All stay indoors month, over.

Here half-intelligent country's infection chart look graph showing country simply give lot good information virus time. immediately clear virus spread great understanding outdoor vs indoor, masked vs mask, thinking way early on. excessive closures point part view ""do whatever think might even slightly slow virus figure later."" park closures part that.

you need understand extent totally new unknown thing still is, leaders expected act based minmal information basically Canadian vaccines coming from? EU. seems like real ally currently rely on. Even deliveries reduced. EU got hit delays, Canada still receiving basically vaccines one western ally. ""It says the average death rate is 0.8%, though 2017 2019 the death rate is listed 0.9%.

If deadly, numbers saying otherwise? chryon graphic screen actual facts real numbers.. People lasting ICUs significantly people hospitalized before. Hospitalizations 50% matter days deaths drop significantly. another possibility heard speculated about. 

Having incompletely inoculated population coexisting pandemic still spreading give virus opportunities mutate strains evade vaccine.

I heard experts podcast musing could trying tamp covid next three decades. think it, avoid dismal future? best half Americans get flu shot year? Covid politicized right wing nut jobs even wear mask. We've got nations like Tanzania expressing zero interest vaccinating people.

And virus live minks infect house way, going end year, likely summer number people give fuck quickly approaches 0.

And yet, sat empty hospital ship multiple empty field hospitals. Trump might suck all, Cuomo really better refused work federal government/cooperate Trump/accept resources would made horrific nursing home mandate unnecessary.

Also, nursing home mandates involved shady dealings states well. PA, Secretary Health Rachel Levine pulled mother nursing home put hotel hours nursing home mandate went effect here, showing knew well policy straight dangerous - good news Levine though, Biden picked Assistant Secretary Health.

Also, western countries trying tsk tsk developing countries taking Russian Chinese vaccines shitty. get caution part. getting second dose soon figured I’m vaccinated is, visits still allowed. response admin Nobody read article Fauci first recommend lockdowns? far tell answer [March 15, even pretty equivocal.

It's estimated point, US [1.17 active Covid infections. Every state West Virginia confirmed cases. Fauci (and Western ""experts"") much, much late acknowledging insufficiency test-and-trace. taking painkillers hours getting vaccine? we're talking pricing. places US permissive zoning (Houston example) none housing basically free.

We're talking pricing; we're talking access affordable housing one build equity in. Pricing inequalities come entirely different - adjacent group structural flaws inefficiencies built housing markets take assuming everyone wants home. Lots people rent want tied piece land. Lots people want apartment-style amenities (pool, fitness center, etc.) less available condo-style buildings. Lots people want pay entire purchase price live nicer unit could otherwise afford.

You helping make point expounded on. amenities available communities homeowners housing artificially constrained? landlords build things us? can't means sustainable personal societal future instead giving equity rent-seeking landlords? even making assumptions people \*want\* housing, ""wants"" conditioned decades even centuries desire conditioned control shelter housing access? (i.e. hold power wealth use wealth constrain supplies sustainable goods order gain profit)

Also, economic VALUE created landlords, given \*fact\* artificial constraining supply.

Re: ""dint"" - know Google voice doesn't.

You're also making assumptions multi-family housing condos little claim landlords create economic value; extract value. look variables, impossible deny unless one wants lay smokescreen full arguments (with due respect) gaslight fact artificial constrains make landlords possible - that's always case. value create housing profit - i.e.value THEMSELVES.. Wow racism Yeah totally good news. time summer arrives, guys enjoy sunshine beach Gotta hear sides issue “He didn’t land went heaven” - Grandma. things make even safer beyond wearing mask. Wash hair hour two ahead appointment wet hair. Less time inside better. skip blow dry end. data doesn’t quite match media hysteria SA variant. SA experienced consistent decline deaths fatalities 5 consecutive weeks, without formally rolled vaccination programme. much misinformation New York's nursing home policy.

The policy stated nursing home residents hospitalized whose symptoms improved go back nursing homes even though continued test positive. People continue test positive 90+ days stop contageous.

There's evidence policy lead increase nursing home deaths New York's complete up-to-date nursing home death numbers better per capita states. entirely false. see point making plans something is, optimistically, couple months away. much change then. 


When time comes full restrictions lifted, argument. today tomorrow. boo hoo pet theory, personally. vast majority people know confirmed positive cases likely got large group gatherings they'd recently attended (church, parties, weddings, etc). recovered kept going lives like it's, course, unreasonable assume actually help prevent spread now. least degree.

Meanwhile, people know careful doubling get vaccinated. show per capita cases deaths state, would extremely hard pressed find states mask mandates didn't. would fail test would I.

That's I'm going try hardest get early possible vaccine appointments become widely available. want unvaccinated time masks start coming early.

Edit: Lmao another front page thread right CDC warning people early remove mask mandates. literally already fucking happening. That's crazy. Where'd pull mid April from?

[Official word 100M end vaccine-wise they're quite well country income. vaccine coming hopefully sometime year see 2022. also 30M doses sputnik purchased countries starting talk testing exemptions vaccinated, widespread yet. imagine get common people vaccinated, work places (obviously, check specifics wherever headed). like looked asia thought idiot using mask everywhere able see person's face means lot social interactions. 99% Political theater.  One sides exists entirely make enemy other. stand everything propose matter ridiculous. [100M end Thank reply!!! Peace Huge difference ‘may provide great degree protection, need study more’ vs ‘does provide’. said, Covid developing strain entirely avoids immunity, year started spread, virus behaves like flu. Rather we’ve known coronaviruses - stable, you’ve one level immunity keep future infections mild ever get again. “Everything like 2019 except masks limited closures public events.” That’s half true elders hospitals workers wake everyday feeling free.

In Australia, masks pretty much non existent outside Sydney Victoria. clubs fully open public transport lovely nonsocial distancing feel. hosted football game 250% many people Super Bowl. hug grandparents feel safe going store.

The thing different 2019 isn’t weekly news backpacker drowning also sign venues contact tracing. Anything add? :^) f would make rule saying need permission wear mask?

If people want wear mask, able to. seems like common sense. Cuomo likely laying low whole nursing home controversy news cycle. Well maybe get new eyes.

The average case count dropping 4000 every day since January 8, I've checking every day waiting see decline slow down. hasn't. That's end sight. decline.

18.3% adult Americans- almost one six- gotten first dose looking like foreseeable supply issues get second get rest country them. We're almost 2,000,000 doses day. That's end sight. immunizations.

Fauci saying Johnson Johnson going approved imminently, that's United States. countries AstraZeneca, Sputnik V, Sinovac, more. That's end sight. vaccines.

Pessimism point denial. We're finally stage pandemic good news keeps coming people seem clawing thin straws trying disprove facts get way misery. nauseating obnoxious. wonder many people care anymore. teacher unions U.S. point time want kids thinking worrying covid-19. much normalcy afford them.

Edit: changed better sub visit much, much better “well one died.”

Says American literally care 500k died. Well, that's original comment advocated, seen anywhere. frankly, public health officials recommend this, it? like wearing mask, really understand hubris bucking public health guidelines people 'know better' know. Hence wonder far go even cuomo/newsom/bowser willing lift restrictions. Yanks, school shootings also 'normal' believe stopped now. going J&amp;J Ah yes, thing morons use literally anything.

The faster ends faster ditch masks. Heard Belgium got hammered real bad, poor buggers. get vaccines yet? Pfizer Moderna deliver doses US April J&amp;J driver June.  natural immunity fact people better job mask wearing/social distancing holiday season. know Cuomo already starting lift stuff, Sports venues set open 10% next week  Health Ministry said Sunday two Israelis ***who recently recovered*** coronavirus reinfected variant first identified South Africa, making total three cases. 

People recently recovered coronavirus usually strong SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. wonder anyone information regarding  severity level prior infection. Hopefully scientists making excellent progress variant specific combo vaccines! Potential definite though.

If vaccine prevent hospitalizations deaths, useful tool normalcy MRNA ones. We're hoping start first doses end month. Even though they've said that... I'm still holding breath. Reminds guy 'Clerks'. ""Whaddaya mean there's ice?! mean gotta drink coffee hot!"" think article apolitical allowed. Kinda shitty person aren’t ya. make stupid comparisons? also fewer gun deaths. POSSIBLE? US waiting global crisis pass. US prediction fully open July 4th largely open memorial day. Let's wait see happens.

Government's typically times crisis. true vaccines yes? never medicated young son gets shots reason. MRNA technology save millions lives Corona taken. statement seems... harsh say sounds like lie? true we’ve entered entirely new phase Covid, strain reinfect ~1b people who’ve it, vast majority likely never vaccinated.  I'm hoping June maybe even May we're lucky :)

Come J&amp;J! We're talking forced readmission covid patients whose symptoms improved. policy. people longer contageous result measurable increase nursing home deaths. It’s every one articles ones saying “this life now” months months people comment section saying wearing masks 2024 social distancing end 2022 etc etc. think bit seeing excitement people ready fight someone says otherwise. makes think I'm worried? No, certainly ""pandemic"", probably still around there. scheduled test tomorrow contacted manager told quarantine 2/25/21 found [this pretty optimistic. “... dataset still small, statistical analysis current vaccination data consistent strong decline (i.e. effective end) pandemic within ~40-70 days.” Clearly Buddha, thinking. learned let go emotions, worldly possessions, feelings overnight like did. We're done buddy. sure venue read (Maybe RNZ?) close contacts childs school 50 number. 

It hinges number contacts outcome testing said. China started wearing masks soon thing. US, people dumb shit. hate bad look international community. pandemic really exposed true colors. Amen ..! hate schrader valve arms beeps every five minutes laser link Guys I'm getting first dose tomorrow!!! I'm excited nervous side effects. words wisdom? mean, federal money even talking about?

These states ran political party trying stop federal government giving states federal money covid.... 

That would sort like threatening thing want. pretty concerned this.

Those know pretty concerned it. hopium junkies around parts lost denial. Naw, almost over. Party summer ahead!!!! way. US done amazing job Federal level OWS distribution, finally local governments good job administration..

From vaccine perspective best case scenario could possible imagine wildest dreams No, states picking orders, essential workers getting vaccinated some, others. Teachers vaccinated states others. states vaccinating 65+ yet 75 +. Access much matters. vaccination sites nearby, low income person may means get there. Furthermore, vaccination sites low income areas, people areas able grab slots, limiting access limited mobility. flaw sign systems. confusing part. Canada apparently benefit Indias agricultural reform  matter? Seems like information useful shaming people/making feel terrible takes practice. gotta try stop calm anxiety overcomes you.

I’m saying would work everyone Pretty good countries can't open freezer door  deleted account spring well. becoming way toxic virtue signaling covid upcoming election US... take anymore. mental health improved almost immediately Yeah, 100% took back well. Pretty proud humanity coming something good true. Oxford Astra zenica often COVID that? symptomatic asymptomatic cases, many actually suffering 90+ days infection? 50s deadline end April! Oh jee can't wait see media shit say ""but der durrrr da varient!"" expect EU BioNtech factories supply US. Honestly know government allowing this. EU take care first. Countries like India China 1/100th daily death rate US parts EU pursue vaccine diplomacy.

I also wish major countries like Australia, Canada Japan could stepped bit licensed Oxford vaccine whatever preventively built factory 6 months ago. Perhaps felt need first wave hit hard.

And worth despite seeming high vaccination rates US, parent in-laws 70s still got called get first vaccine shots eagerly waiting. Add autoimmune disease high risk group still turn take 4-6 weeks best case. Fortunately I'm able work home till happens.  Purely anecdotal, sister Covid felt bad couple days getting vaccine need switch order... sue recoup federal money, rather make federal money conditional complying federal standards voluntary basis.

That's goober repeatedly. one shot strategy. lot liquor stores Colorado, comment meant much generally.  USA contributed COVAX UK.

Source. USA last weeks announced even asking UK let’s countries like Belgium, death toll higher major country keep vaccines actually made country

What talking about? UK gets AZ vaccines made Belgium. UK gets keep first 100m produced UK, different fact EU gets keep first 300m produced Belgium. UK's fault EU late sign asking

Actually, UK asked. EU simply demanded made legal threats amounted nothing know got leg stand on. They've completely shut since contract would big problem slow UK roll little

Why slow rollout 26 EU countries worse affected UK Belgium? singling Britain? EU countries better share burden? Hungary sending Russian vaccines makes understand UK truly never committed Europe it.

So committed tried trigger Article 16. India Russia going picking slag

The Serium Institute India producing 1.3bn AZ vaccines year, **at cost**, UK gone way ensure anyone produce vaccine so, insisting Lots lost soft power USA UK.

Not UK. UK done countries anyone. made genomics capability available world track mutations. gave vaccine away cost. donated Gavi COVAX anyone.

Bad UK. Evil UK. selfish. potentially semantic point. body reintroduced virus immunity, still 'catch' again, guess, depending body reacts, people categorize differently. exposed covid, immune system kicked high gear took care intrusion point exhibit symptoms viral load body significantly reduced, think we're splitting hairs.

I think increasingly common misconception vaccine main benefit prevent symptomatic - main benefit trains body detecting virus early mounting strong enough immune response effectively fights virus prevents proliferation body.

That causes prevention symptoms, also prevents effective spreader virus, leads things like herd immunity. anything laying simply here's British Medical Journal , here's [Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration's finding]( bottom BMJ link see scale determine ""very frail"". language carefully hedged basically every health authority shit bed highly public ways last year none want reputation tattered, black white Norway vaccinating people expected months weeks live people dying mild reactions fever diarrhea

If could use Israeli model convince raging American idiots universal healthcare good idea. I'm dodging, I'm telling truth want hear lol  fact larger trial weighted toward compromised. Israel started giving vaccines at-risk basis. I.e people serious conditions (and health workers) first. elderly, etc. divided everyone age at-risk brackets. 

It's last week everyone wants one register for, receive vaccine. study fact weighted *more* towards people would otherwise much greater risks. 

Hospital numbers still great (go-go ignored quarantine) deaths serious health effects way  don’t understand question. 

There several variants currently spreading United States. mechanism would make think particular variant shouldn’t spreading? racist shit Indians toilet access disingenuous.

Got link? parents confusing 5g tracking injections globalist socialism lasers. USA population 130 million. be?

Where getting numbers from, US numbers bit low. US population 330 million long continue guys really believe everybody get vaccine easily? prevents serious disease, virus still continue mutate? COVID like flu? live it. one thing Trump’s America first logical country first attitude. basic obligation American government people. doesn’t mean won’t give vaccines countries give least substantial amount Americans vaccine distribute elsewhere  NZ island size Colorado, know people try compare two areas remotely similar anyway shape form. expect state US lockdown 3 cases would locked since March Nice dodge You’re 5 days exposure get test reasonably accurate. can’t don’t want quarantine would definitely get tested. One things pandemic taught medical science delay thinking might problem knowing fact problem much larger average layperson might think. think it’s generally agreed minimally significantly reduces transmission. It’s incredibly hard design study test though. 

Said differently... everything know viruses vaccines form significant widespread transmission would rare Judging comments thread. Keep rolling dice man. Eventually everyone comes snake eyes roll enough. hate many people compelled find country “blame” origin virus. It’s helpful know originated, unknown cases found China Italy anywhere else December, doesn’t make country faulty another country. It’s completely different story known cases Covid-19 found reported. Didnt actual gun reform Christchurch shooting? Unlike US mass shooting daily even hear anymore.

What’s changed fundamentally? hospitals empty? Life go back normal we’ve able contain spread. course, chronic issues could affect whether get vaccines, might good idea speak doctor first. Otherwise, really issue getting shots. anything, they’re ones need urgently anyone else household. 

Anecdotally: healthy woman 20s felt quite rough couple days vaccine. parents 65, didn’t even get sore arm. credit, Trump authorized Warp Speed. Pretty much right thing presidency.

Indubitably though, I'm pretty sure party power, would've come something analogous. Unfortunately cockroaches probably survive lol got Serbia, Russia believe. also deleted spewed lot anti-covid/mask stuff social media, actually caught it. guess bit embarrassed.

I aware existed. Israel’s population half size US healthcare worker population alone... healthcare workers got priority vaccine US world.

FUCK ISREALI GOVERNMENT [This reference young'uns   Luckily mRNA tech likely work exceptionally well flu too, won’t bother masks flu either. Nothing done. opposition strong enough yet. dufus owns media brainwash people pleases fact they've done poorly things erase they've done good here.vyou praise praise needed criticize cricitism needed. Well it’s never going fully go away. It’ll control. 

The fact virus spreads asymptomatically transmitted animals good indicator it’ll endemic like flu. we’ll need vaccine every year. Yeah read story. People living/working buildings air vents going room room, heat AC pushing air through.
We really need get low cost virus killing air/furnace filters deployed asap exactly Never mind. I’m gonna start argument again. find funny ppl still think good comparison. also conveniently forget poor countries far younger population thus care lot less COVID first place. developing nations effectively back normal already. That’s...I guess that’s one way it. dad hadn’t managed get appointment mom searching week, expect would done similar. Old people best sometimes. Haha understand mostly combination fact roughly 1/3 population covid less immune, vaccines. making vaccinations useless.

Not all. That's boosters for. Yeah Q677H mutation known affect hACE2 antibody neutralization. First identified India seems gaining traction here. Although, right bonds could worrying N439K mutation 4x affinity ACE2, bringing measles level infectivity. finding N501Y, higher binding ACE2 leads higher chance death good...Would surprising given recent events. Crossing fingers know count many tests done day chart it, right? outperform countries, yep. Last saw US top ten per capita vaccines distributed.

I replying comment logic sounded like arguing per capita measurements bad, think are. It’s actually based first 2 voters. 2 downvotes, almost everyone else follow suit downvote. two upvotes same. 

I can’t tell many times I’ve deleted heavily downvoted comment reposted, get heavily upvoted. It’s called hacking hive mind. bad countries buying poop Sputnik/Chinese vaccines. (Because money going pockets politicians.) Like would risk vaccine even work might severe side effects?

I'll wait private sector get hands Pfizer. Pay price get everyone vaccinated.

When be, that's question. second Pfizer shot 11 days ago. side effects either dose except sore arm injection site couple days tiredness usual night a
couple days. would go away? 80 Auckland funerals postponed today due change Covid-19 alert levels Funeral Directors Association warning puts lot last minute stress grieving families.

Brides grooms-to-be also anxiously faced making big call whether postpone nuptials change alert levels - prevents gatherings 10 Auckland 100 rest country - comes force.

The government restrictions initially place midnight Wednesday could potentially extended. doubt efficacy mods masochists I've stated ridiculous (I'm saying certainty I'm correct) maybe instead removal show evidence disproving statements, spreading disinformation, stated stop transmission, rather lessen effect virus taken Haha serves right, stuffed fat fucking face like become unattractive unhealthy blob. Oh… made sad. yelled jesus telling truth too. 
Most people admit morbid curiosity bad news distantly effects them. posting country much larger proportion population prison modern country, right?

Hint: american, I'm right. far, far likely coincidence COVID-19. normal year dozens different virus strains different symptoms circulating, SARS-COV-2 started spreading november 2019 US, would've caused outbreak much quickly. Also, student coming back China tell much - there's 1.4 billion people China less 1% live Wuhan. Also, infected mother would've probably infected many students super spreader event. Finally, COVID-19 symptoms rarely last 3 months. flu disappear Pfizer Moderna make mRNA vaccine flu, least bother get shot. We’re end pretty much respiratory diseases thanks mRNA tech. literally last pandemic human history. Yeah, could still good enough reduce death severe illness. far know strain/vaccine combo that's become least effective due mutation. Economic aid catch term everything specifically military. goes security. USA bad posts get internet points! Need ear?  “NOOO CAN’T CRITICIZE APARTHEID STATE NOOOOOOO!”  works laundry facility. contact passengers crew. first question ask is: vaccinated group randomly chosen? not, efficacy false claim. randomly chosen, doubt, serious moral issue. new tsa machines, need take shit, walk through. need take laptop either. like back 90s agree win. humanity survived black plague killed 30-50% people caught it.

But still going suck. least Moderna vaccine advice you’re protected least 2 weeks second shot cases takes 6 weeks build sufficient immunity. Read comment. We've poured shit ton economy well. guess they’re can, can’t force governors make rules. 

In Texas, vaccine rollout unmitigated disaster 1/3rd state falling “prioritized” categories central distribution sign up, it’s literally 10s hundreds separate lists.

You read media headlines think “they give aid Israel country” Israelis vaccinating American money? Take walk. think many us suspected around longer first cases. EU China two strains seems suggest around long enough mutate. 2 strains pop relatively time seems little unlikely.

The mission also found infections across region first detected. seems suggest originate Wuhan, could generally spreading virus across region.

A year ago, wrote reddit suspected also infecting US first detected cases. time found cases, unable determine infected links contact anyone China. Meaning spreading community quite time.

Finally getting past nonsense lab leaks. I'm debate Israeli/Palestinian relations sub suffice say US blockade Mexico occupied territory Canada. That’s awesome Yeah, 3 months talking 3 euros difference, liability structure brand new type vaccines aimed used population, track record safety long term effects....

...Naaaaah prices lol AstraZeneca wrong? giving EU produced vaccines EU AFAIK. Phizer one exporting. grandma would’ve loved it. fact probably would’ve harsher Two completely different things.

That's symptom.

However, see quite advocating permanent mask mandates (during flu season) sub, strongly disagree with. think people able begin schedule first dose April. Current wait times range 2 weeks 2 months, however. I'd expect people fully vaccinated time around July. Well duh went unknown disease global pandemic Yes agree. youre planning going step behind virus.

You want step behind virus. cost countries lives money.

Even variant transmissibility WT eventually spread vaccine effective. Think back Jan 2020 virus China. Would OK worrying country yet?  insanity. wish half confident things actually know about. I'll take small observational study study 1000 alex. must trolling. see, said tainted vaccines, poisoned vaccines. sure what’s confusing you. think people frequenting/brigading subreddit ones. Though varies greatly thread. US lot issue right now, however, vaccines one them. Never unless people take freedom back. always another 'wave' another 'scary variant' 

We're reaching 2000 cases day population 17 million yet politicians audicity call situation 'concerning' 

A short lockdown October/December turned lockdown summer. wont indias democracy isnt fueled slave labour Today, government said wont relaxation restrictions mid April earliest. 

We got Lockdown November... dijiste ninguna ""verdad"".

Es ironico que en otro mensaje acuses de aires de superioridad ahora te estés considerando dueño de la ""verdad"" por un comentario escueto en el que dijiste nada export ban, contract, executive order, law, licensing, quotas, matter.

Or think export ban politician comes public shouts top lungs : ""WE DECLARE THERE'S EXPORT BAN"" looool

I know special, get there. Emergency Use Authorization thing approval.  No. many doses administered. currently still unknown effective South African variant, [ known prevents severe cases Use credit card local restaurant it. Though one day week make sure everyone orders day. Yes, see post example please provide source claim? 6000 people died...

Cool bro. big deal. Bwahahahahahahaa read said? 

Every single time talk Republicans plug opinion, guess it’s ok don’t long talking Democrats J&amp;J easy administer, single shot vaccines also great way smother spread keep nasty variations better contained. Cut routes transmission honest God containment measures needed. No, I’m saying Israel purposely poisoning Palestinians tainted Covid-19 vaccines.

Can’t keep track bullshit apparently contrast gig, grocery EMT workers able use excuse? already approval. Jajaja mames, proyectaste un chingo de inseguridades que traes adentro asumiendo un vergo de cosas sobre un mensaje que evidentemente (por el LOL) era una broma.

Yo tampoco voy entender ese complejo de hacerse las víctimas. 

Te ofrezco una disculpa por especificar que mi comentario era una broma (pensé que el ""lol"" era suficiente) abrirte tantas heridas, es de todo lo que puedo responsabilizar. Lo demás chécalo en terapia. media convinced everyone chance dying way higher actually is.

Under 40s really worried like are. could find, another source?  choose proactive fight believe right good. people like make things difficult be. Imagine everyone attitude, nothing would ever change. According Kyriakides, least 700 million vaccine doses available end September, ""which enough 70 percent EU population.""

Most important part article tbh. Seems includes three approved vaccines also hopefully increase downsides masks. Masks increase mental health social well-being. Masks decrease mental health social well-being 0%. anything even support claim won’t year? qualifier that? SA experienced 5 weeks consistent decline infections fatalities vaccine rollout due begin end week. believe single-dose J&amp;J vaccine favoured.

This variant described mild moderate, different mutations worldwide. present statistics suggest SA variant particularly deadly, bearing mind public health measures driving decline infections SA administration vaccines.

TLDR: South African here. evidence yet variant worse mutation, whether known yet discovered. According trials, largest reduction symptom onset around day 10-12. Subtracting 5 days infection onset would indicate protection symptomatic infection mostly ramps around days 5-7 first dose. sorts data points less consistent this. Older people might take longer, however.

The 50% 80% values see averages data entire time period doses. instance 0% protection days 0-10 90% days 11-21 get number around 50%. again, that's day symptom onset, day infection surely correct timeline (but directly measurable). ""Well job makers, woman dead weight.""

Probably people go sleep night. Ironic, decent reading comprehension would realize isn’t junk.

Yet are. Quite relied NY model. Ok liked Fauci started, Im also glad something Biden. hes starting REEAALLY get nerves. Marge! vaccine Camp Grenada? EU revoke AZ contract sue them, they're unreliable caused harm anything else. think it’s going replace AZ, effective South African variant difficult handle Pfizer AstraZeneca f$cks EU. easy. 

A company may choose cooperate EU fight EU. AZ exiled EU. This. Thank much saying this. fiance long distance relationship cannot see due travel bans put place, lives exemptions place couples. True one might argue ""it could worse"", really horrific, especially barely seems light hope end tunnel. hope best case scenario take thing one day time. 85% 28 days. 49 days one needed Hate burst bubble, maybe need get Reddit then. 99.9% posts opinions average Joe. case original poster agreed then? said first, agreed.

And makes think I'm sick preventive measures. I've advocated entire pandemic beyond, family we're vaccinated comfortable everyone safe. say things thoughts opinions know nothing about.

What makes think lift restrictions everyone vaccinated? What's threat then? super random. biggest thing watch hydration (weigh yourself, keep glass water glass electrolytes drink whichever tastes better keep weight same; one pound = one point), watch blood oxygen (pulse oximeter). im going wearing masks forever lol, like it. Well ever used gorilla glue hair spray? Limiting spread contracting go hand hand, one tell probably late already spread around. actually care stopping spreading whatever prevent getting it, gotten probably exposed people. Well give Myanmar, Mexico 2nd best customer. Jumping queue, UK made deals 3 months EU signed contract, spent money domestic production capacity got ready production.

The UK put contract AZ first 100million produced UK would used UK.

How UK hoarding vaccines every one used?

The UK also supplies EU ingredients vaccine production.

You sound like know little this, EU vaccine commission chance? hard lockdown New Zealand essential services open, called Level 4, 4 weeks back March 2020. it’s mostly couple weeks Level 3 contactless businesses allowed open, Auckland couple weeks Level 3 August Feb 2021. that’s considerably shorter lot countries months restriction helped local businesses greatly. incidence strain Israel? Australia manufacturing Oxford vaccine locally. first production run started two days ago 1 million doses week made necessary whole population vaccinated without relying imports. local vaccine manufacturer started preparing make Oxford vaccine back August.

 top 20 million Pfizer, first arrived yesterday, 55 million doses novavax order. expectation excess doses plan donate poorer countries pacific asia. Eventually? Perhaps. now, though. naturally transmissible. Bend curve wind dying home hospital crowded 

Now we're beyond want people get sick go hospital first place 

Make sense? idea quickly production distribution going continue ramp up. could easily see 10% weekly increases dosing continue. not. guess could make two models based two different assumptions. receive new info share it.

The UK variant talk fear mongering.

An RNA virus constantly mutates. group needs care mutations like medical researchers. Unless mutation clearly changes viruses behavior. established UK variant. known active outbreak especially severe flu certain school, would say questionable best highly immoral worst demand anyone go work place regardless. case flu season, case know damn well quite likely catch relatively deadly disease specific places, like health care workers hospitals care homes. means protect people now, give teachers vaccination demanding go there. Sorry, dont like french people It’s like context matters something idk I'm states, 50m people already vaccinated? case. AZ gives false feeling protection thus us quite dangerous. case must replaced reliable BioNTech Moderna Curevac. 

Moderna delivers US. cares? Fauci cushy job doesn’t need really even care media attention. firmly believe trying best educate people, he’s also caught deliberately misleading people. betterment, least thought. 

Osterholm polar opposite. guy using background try turn next Dr Drew Dr Oz. Covid goes away, media career. He’s borderline fraud shit says. know he’s nailed every wave, he’s also completely wrong 50 waves called didn’t happen. People likely respond couple doom predictions right. Yeah, well fucking make million doom predictions, couple right. could sit predict demise every single stock NYSE. assuredly get right. doesn’t mean listen financial advice. means opposite. 

I wish best Fauci done. Whether stays position retires long career, wish well. Osterholm hand, wouldn’t even tiny bit sad podcasting career dies immediately. He’s hack who’s capitalizing peoples’ fear. opinion, see masks mandates lifted several left states (NY, CA, WA, etc.) CDC health metrics state safe so, see happening summer. 

Like not, governors want risk decisions like face backlash several people could've ""prevented unnecessary deaths"". Literally one asking schools open without requiring masks testing/quarantine. would much better boost Biontech production. matter time new variants spread Europe reduce Novavax efficacy. eh... I'd still rather pfizer moderna, POINT - though data could change that. Reasoning:  
  \-Higher efficacy variants  
  \-I'm worried potential long term covid affects getting severe covid. Statistically speaking, seems people ending long covid symptoms end hospital. Even [asymptomatic patients potential lung zero data currently published, find least, vaccines affect frustrating.   


All said, would still 100% take whatever vaccine offered, first chance. always anyone information vaccinated patients nothing worry terms would thrilled change mind. Obviously Monday usually see lowest totals trend clear. think could really expect serious variant wave concern pessimistic onlookers would begun seeing reversal now. worst think see mini wave ends looking like plateau. ""burden really"" wear mask. masks useless especially use cases. could actually help stop spread disease businesses better ventilation closed space, would require people spend lot money thus, would unprofitable instilling employees fear wear n+1 masks.

Why person risk need vaccine first place? Sounds like p-hacking me. thousands random posts predicting stuff. Finding one happened right prove prescience.

I’m sorry lack reading comprehension. news made sensitive inter acting spouse, don’t need right much anymore. changes real. Im exited refine side. entire planet ever lockdown single, preventable disease worker's comp existed?

Seems like rules change unprecedented circumstances. even expensive, here's one capable -70C 15K USD: mexican government wanted to, would already necessary infrastructure vaccines. Ugly Ive noticed last couple weeks people sub tend mock people trying keep family safe. wearing two masks get vaccine makes feel better, nothing wrong that. forever, time yes. I'm sure job continue 2022 Cuomo seems like person genuinely psychologically incapable introspection self-doubt. He's like Trump immediately deflects possible criticism critique ""you're unfair, know talking about, someone else's fault..."" mindset literal child. Court cases made law culture shift long works. 

You review attempts homosexual marriages passed individual states failed. Furthermore, Supreme Court ruling, many states outright banned same-sex free open western society people could show faces society eyes allowed house all.

I love hearing narrative. free government oppressing us forcing us wear masks.

Guess what? pay taxes (if make enough money). wear clothes go out. need driver's license drive. can't drive drunk. can't assault people.

We're country rule law. Wearing mask easy keeps people safe. 

I miss sub filled anti-maskers anti-vaxxers. Since we've never, ever communicated before, basing ad hominem attack me? Sweeping generalizations almost never helpful.

I personally work six months pandemic. Nevertheless, hope making things better, have:

* Donated local food bank incredible need
* Personally contributed flipping presidency Biden, live Georgia
* Personally contributed flipping Senate blue, voted Ossoff Warnock Georgia
* Written letters representatives, indicating need codify candidates releasing tax returns, issues
* Planned donate publicize candidacy whomever runs Brian Kemp

What else, specifically, would like change America's political environment, maintaining job, caring family, including elderly father spouse, lost parent last week? medical condition prevents marching, know making suggestions.

It sounds like venting based negative stereotype Americans, lot us post Reddit try change things. uphill battle power, people work hold positions protect interests. Still, people like Stacey Abrams Fair Fight Action making extraordinary difference, support publicizing donating efforts. Like many folks, much able circumstances. companies free ban mask wearing change operation protect workers covid? sacrifice workers say “You must caught somewhere else”? Uh huh. FREE PALESTINE!! 'Nuff said, thx.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Clearly incorrect since suits dismissed point. guys need glory holes Cringe qualifications claiming something like that? 100% Certainty doesn’t exist. empirical data long history using vaccines supports sharp reduction spread.

Proof vaccination whole medical history, slippery slope toward day. 

And vaccinated people worry - lockdowns primarily saving people, one sick person. someone turns vaccine gets sick, seek medical care require forms support. could get person agree advance forego things, maybe would work unlikely ever work real world. ant-vaxxer remains drain society, maintain restrictions bunch dumbasses thought knew better. don’t many kn95’s wear either cloth mask surgical mask extend life kn95 many vaccine reluctant good options might fear one vaccine technology another (wrong may be) reported side effects. Anything advances US herd immunity good thing. Get many possible vaccinated fast possible variants can't run amok chance develop new ones could problem. can't infect, can't mutate :) Zero covid forever solution. pretty great way get forever solution (herd immunity vaccination).

Most countries suffered endless lockdowns countless deaths. NZ went zero covid route lived normal part, deaths. time they'll vaccinate population got though mess minimal damage done. don’t. One does, doesn’t. Thank you. Bad faith way describe it. favor genocides. IDK go watch YouTube see confirms anti conservative bias narrative. EU export controls. Thus EU allows exported not. Rule 34 That’s guys don’t know science works .

So said that? two weeks later turns evidence suggests masks actually help, I’m changing mind gonna start wearing one anyone half brain well.

Sorry trumps people don’t one .  Nope. 

Check back 2 weeks. think ivermectin basis working either haven’t read single study you’re anti science. There’s meta analysis right critical care team highest recovery rate whole country passed multiple rounds peer review showing ivermectin helps stages disease. 

Go tell country hands kits nearly eradicated virus. city Mexico that’s handing months lowest death rates spread per capita region. think missed whole Farmers Protest India exactly people vs corps. 100% agree entire post stupidity, though mention airlines actually flush air cabin circulate new air constantly part covid procedures.

Just wanted share information little comforting learning flew back. Almost lots money cure ignorance. Wow, good news relative. Yeah, that's thing. contract. Two parties agree.

Now, EU willing pay price dedicated supply, I'd imagine pharma companies would happily figure much lose potential sales rest world, price EU.

Of course EU would move fast, because, seen, wait 3 months, get them.

It seem come move fast, pay price. AstraZenca anyway selling Covid vaccine cost IIRC. Imagine shock.

People revolt take away bread games. matter time untill first economic fallout going hit. hope late still escape tyranny. real totalitarian governments form. control pandemic bud...

You educate citizens government (and lets fair, one stupid ass government educate) best manage existence pandemic, vaccine exists. 

And Fauci rockstar space. similar reports Sweden, Germany, Austria Italy, AZ vaccinations either halted hospital staff reluctant get AZ shot. Canada give honorary citizenship yet?? It'll fluctuate. thread everyone mixes. Notice 14 downvotes. always forget Reddit firmly favor Genocide Palestinians. mean, *I always forget!!* We're generally good people, too, ... fucking annoying. Pfizer Moderna comes ""we got this"" response. EEA nation stupid buy thought, reason, EU would us covered guess not. disappointmening mess. feels right, said it. EU spent 3 months discussing liability, prices lol Yeah, hell wants take COVID test every time step airplane go cruise go restaurant concert movies name it?

Unless to, things going much hassle I'm trying relax vacation, example. want worry quarantine somewhere test positive COVID I'm vacation. Life risk itself. well past time people begin accept this. said? sub overrun people looking angry something. blame US anything? I'm criticizing US, pointing fact parameters measurable time. Duh? forget this? really hard read anti mask comments assume entirely political theater/entitlement. One word: autocorrect. French really like British success story - ready dis every opportunity. needed babysitter services, schools since October 

Oh idea Town going vaccinate us never claimed people distrust Fauci, guess making relevant argument hard you. Defending statement mean agree it.)

Yeah, that's said ""suggests."" comparing pants good comparison. Pants permanent modesty issue. really hard copy manufacturing process drugs.

That's usually point contention patents; drug process make it. Ok, said? Y'all different topic entirely. led believe happen. defending Cuomo all, virtually every state nursing home policy onset pandemic? sure that's accurate. year things looking like greatly improved summer. Hoping safe least start gathering friends family then. problem pretty soon at-risk groups fully vaccinated deaths hospitalizations go level flu past diseases even *consider* wearing masks for. people coastal cities going continue push mask mandates ""case counts"" even cases longer translate bad outcomes like hospitalizations deaths, due vaccines. American here. nearly normal year starting April. thing closed concert venues conferences. Otherwise year like except masks public spaces. worth nothing risk death lot different risk hospitalization serious complications. 


The risk death dozens times higher older people younger. risk hospitalizations serious illness times likely. shit knock feet really try avoid getting it, even probably die. Buck there, dickhat. Separated couples allowed sad too. Everyone reason sad fucking pandemic. Wish one hand shit other. See gets filled first. 900k people jobs still come back, sinking like rock. Wear one high quality mask. case, make sure KN95 fits well call day. try combine high quality masks lower ones, likely reduce fit. 

Masks worth wearing: KN95, KF94, N95.  think people morons understanding literal words wrote, I'm putting back up. I'm criticizing US, pointing fact parameters measurable time. There’s way know since US manufactures many vaccines export many. unfair advantage provides compared wealthy country can’t even obtain decent amount (say, like Canada), completely obscures downstream successes failures I’m saying problem US vaccine rollout, I’m saying won’t really able evaluate years later, all. beauty Twitter *you* create feed view.

If pissing off, change follow.  2 extra seconds. absurdly minor. wearing pants bigger inconvenience people cant wear mask beyond me. No, right public health issue. forever (and likely much longer). 


Once public health emergency over, care feel need mask not. local community rampant spread, exhausting tell adults part solution. 


I'm sorry came country forced religious headwear you, temporary situation find in. mean, every nation ""thrown back lockdown"". US ""lockdown"" since April 2020, able travel almost everything except concerts. yeah - places like New Zealand desperately need vaccinations stop endless lockdown cycle. What’s wrong getting test? I'm sure many looking it. really many finished yet, long-term requires lot time pass. housing artificially constrained via zoning means, everyone could home, shelter. would need build rental housing.

Again, we're talking pricing. places US permissive zoning (Houston example) none housing basically free.

And assuming everyone wants home. Lots people rent want tied piece land. Lots people want apartment-style amenities (pool, fitness center, etc.) less available condo-style buildings. Lots people want pay entire purchase price live nicer unit could otherwise way, I'm saying landlords evil anything like that. I'm simply saying manage exist dent fact housing artificially constrained.

*dint, dent

I'm anti-condo, relying condo-style housing solve problems lack multifamily units strikes fools' errand. There's way many problems condos realistic. literally says can't ship vaccines outside UK - what's interpretation wonder?

Banned vaccine money? Wtf talking about?

God forbid expect private company deliver contract obligations factories, right?

You're place, talk UK facilities share UK resources, say there's vaccine export ban xD?

You're contradicting yourself.

Here's story: UK exported single vaccine, allow AZ use factories EU orders, enforcing export ban. would argue though culture didn’t “rapidly” change examples cited. Court cases made law culture shift long works. 

Going free open western society people could show faces society eyes allowed house all. trend hope see continue even July levels unacceptable. fuck said? Yes, protect eyes. Also prevents touching eyes. 

There many articles wearing goggles extra protection. Again, evidence show deadly say deadly, matter coming Fraudi Johnson, evidence speak I've hearing pilots, people afford to, flying private jet right now. mask regulations deal passengers.

So sounds like airline trying get people left, come back. No. think little bit sore proven wrong. see ""likes"" posts? people feel way. whole bunch people trust Fauci masks. one comment, one thread, one message board. think millions think same? (PS Defending statement mean agree it. Take intro debate class). I'd hope so, media convinced 20 year olds get COVID 20% chance dying 60% chance disability, get What? Lol I’m serious, vaccines literally right don’t want end getting sick I’m close getting one. Plus dad, live with, nearly 60 I’d rather safe possible especially him. Acquired immunity, vaccination resolved infection; seasonality; NPI; reduced testing.

This last one is, view, probably due reduced perceived utility testing, infection shifted lowest-risk population, fewest symptoms, still effective outpatient therapy, testing less perceived advantage patient point. People would get tests older, either eagerly getting vaccinated keeping heads masks up, appointment comes up.

These factors contributing variously various locations, possible know dominant factor, would greater knowledge significantly affect public health policy time.

But question tsunami rolled us US, nowhere near bad would without tremendous sacrifices many people (willing no), better days ahead. Praise be. minor? masks difficult wearing pants walking? finish adult trial, get approved adults, apply trial kids. iirc kid trials 4 year increments - 15 12, 11 8, on. phase must successful allow testing younger group ensure safety. bad , or? Ah something important, best keep alive?

So come airline important person's life? Well there's difference ""average"" ""last.""

&amp;#x200B;

The average American get April. last groups get May. Ivermectin scientific baais working, theres new health crisis brazil due people stupidly taking medication lroof working. rockin' economy, like. I'm vegetarian vegan whatever stretch, maybe fur farms? Idk.  herd immunity unachievable? 

Do believe case, masks adopted society?

The thing is, question ‘is physical psychological discomfort worth it?’ function time. discomfort worth months? Yes. discomfort worth years? someone low risk family low risk ... it’s worth it. 

So I’m sorry someone boat ‘high risk’ think mask discomfort worth sacrifice years. don’t, think death pain *small percentage* may suffer worth it. Hi there! “severe” side effects first shot (101.5 fever, sore arm, headache, basically flu minus respiratory symptoms). went away within 48 hours I’m grateful gotten shot!

There’s solid chance won’t side effect all. prepared fact may feel like crap day two. suggest taking day next day work possible, unless work home. Warm showers/baths, cool compress head, bed rest helped - basically way I’d treat case flu. might help get stuff ready case need it. know yet, one family works airport. Oh worry know, live WA state. locked restrictions long humanly possible how’s going? would people fight back, judicial system would intervene order cessation government actions nature. courts rescinded fair number pandemic restrictions ruled violation people's rights.

World meter shows basically plateau (though down) since January 9. 26k one week, 34k next. It’s huge drop they’ve ping ponging range 6 weeks. 

Look cases chart death chart side side. two American companies developed produced viable vaccines: uuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhh virus opportunity mutate every time infects somebody. would happen almost virus. hope Pfizer vaccine widely used one AstaZeneca 63% effective. sounds like story created draw opinion away lab source. smaller dose idea proposed previously ~~Minced~~ Slaoui . Edit: autocorrect Moncef seem keen, probably part due reason regulators go half dose AZ UK, despite producing equal better results 

The issues would smaller sample size base decision relative rest larger p3 trial approach half doses introduces additional logistical complications e.g working received half dose hasn't. oughta know. There's use afraid there's nothing else except continue we've last year keep vaccinating people.

At point might well start afraid Sun becomes red giant engulfs Earth. “soooo move” people critical thinking skills. I’m like literally ever moved life? 

It’s expensive hell better money saved up. Moving costs, first last months rent, security deposits, application/administration fees, utility fees.

Not mention actually job offer lined up. “cheap” places live usually don’t bustling economies full good jobs. Especially work really niche market. Ever moved states without job lined up? have, stressful scary.

And people must literally loner hermits cannot understand many people want move away family, friends, place literally home entire lives. interesting thing though many parts world seen similar decrease time, think getting at. Covid cases worldwide absolute freefall since exact point time. 

Take Arizona example, live. We've done absolutely nothing covid since August last year. Everything fully open since then. yet whatever reason, change whatsoever public policy seemingly nothing negative movement public attitude, 7 day average roughly 2500/day, almost 10k/day early January. bizarrely identical roughly 75% decrease UK exact timeframe, WILDLY different governmental response involved. It's... weird, say least. barbaric letting hundreds thousands countrymen die like UK US?

Not defending China, West emerge much moral authority intact. Academic science failed Karikó. contacted 2015, saw moved private sector, common path researchers university stops offering support. glad see landed feet. now, watch awe, like rest world, technology helped developed leads one spectacular victories history science - vaccine deadly pandemic developed less one year.

So, vaccination day emotional one. lipid-encapsulated mRNA molecules went arm, reminisced Kati Drew, lab circa 2000. thought: right, Kati. right. Huh? making sense. would lower everyone. hard argue people get Contrary that, I'd feel bad fully vaccinated partner want go trips without me. 

Don't get wrong, I'm enjoying earned (she's healthcare worker) encourage so, doubt she'll want go anniversary trip herself.

Just thinking loud, suppose. I'm happy absolutely anyone vaccinated. better. tens millions vaccinated people? Really great thread : steps *appear* reduce risk Covid form “Covid absolutism” — attempts reduce even tiniest risk Covid — ultimately backfire cause increased spread Covid knock effects. Banning students campus taking outdoor walks, example, lead increased instances indoor gatherings students go stir crazy indoors — dramatically risky event. 

We shame scoff joggers without mask thirty feet away us *want* virus map cleanly onto associations dangers — familiar safe dangerous strangers what’s causing problem. People turn around hang friends indoors mask mutual trust — wonder virus keeps spreading.

We need public health plans messaging account human behavior need avoid Covid absolutism — shaming someone distanced park mask likely helping us may even actively hurting us long run. need common understanding thing spreads it’s important certain activities virus around — think sort also lot people infested Covid absolutism form denial virus really spreads (primarily indoors aerosols extended contact people.) Buddy, thread saying even 1% Americans vaccinated. You’re clearly living reality yourself. Thank thoughtful rapid response?? Really? Doesn’t work? know? Please kindly share experience / please kindly advise. magic bullet, either. efficacy several universal vaccine candidates assessed, appears many vaccines may also provide short-term efficacy. Thus, instead one-time replacement seasonal vaccine, new strategies may serve replace efficacious vaccine."" Florida Humoral immunity wanes bit well understood manner covid, I'm sure useful seroprevalence studies necessarily continue producing antibodies months. what's question? lives older people valuable lives younger people. seems direct answer comment late round. person responded would love able wear one sick without people thinking plague. would totally fine wearing mask whenever cold help prevent spreading germs. Sure, nephew constantly unclips seat belt thinks funny. mean stop kids wear seatbelts kids annoying? Someone salty EU?

No country making vaccines, private pharmaceutical companies operations (and funding) countries.

Btw many vaccines UK USA exported far? COVID-19 symptoms even subsided, Peterson's landlord filed eviction St. Charles County circuit court. one courts area eviction proceedings still moving forward, without blanket moratorium.

According article moratorium evictions lives. read federal orders, fill form meet criteria file becomes effective I'm guessing people know that. guess we're happy sacrificing elderly help others. EU pride people want stick around. Distributing rural spaces might be. buying equipment limiting vaccinacion large centers easier/cheaper many thinks. Gdp per capita figure irrelevant. let's say Malta Cyprus perform Pfizer vax; Mexico, Brazil etc 100 times (at least urban, suburban settings, rural areas bit tricky even US). Equipments going cost hundred million dollars whole country. Mexican economy 1.3 trillion dollars, single week lockdown would cost whole supply chain investment. were. Hope get back control. chance get vaccines anytime soon?

Minnesota breaks distribution age currently 44% 1+ dose state 65+ (""Who's Getting Vaccinated"" Didn’t walk back schools reopenings? advisory board meets 26th.

Also means entire population would get covid 19 test theory. saying 1/3rd want get vaccine Darwin's playground, sound like lot people dying prove it. Personally interactions strangers bit clipped because, know, want spend much time close proximity strangers fear getting spreading covid. that's me.

Also think bit weird think depressing, dehumanizing, isolating see someone's full face. you. I'm inside head that's certainly bit a...unique perspective. can't stand Fauci anymore. summer hung every word. Right? people want lied bad turn favorite biased news stations, run 24/7 guys. want advice actual health professionals, prepared love say. It’s job tell scientific truth. know, facts stubborn things. think correct. necessarily scale though, possible test subset population extrapolate results. would also beneficial giving information true length immunity COVID infection. You’re proving point. 

The worst epidemic 100 years killed 500,000 people. elderly. 

For perspective, heart disease kills 600,000 every year. 

You use common sense burden vs benefit analysis, similar court would use. 

Hypothetically, Ebola somehow becomes contagious COVID, fuck ya I’m ok mandatory quarantines. Half world would likely die. 

But coronavirus. burden lockdown quarantines worth benefit. 

Why don’t give government power ban fast food heart disease kills WAY people coronavirus? Human communication involves recognizing people parsing/expressing non-verbal messages. face *very* expressive removing going make us feel way distant. 

I feel like explained. antisocial?

I'm pro-mask like meet interact people normal times, bewildering people find everyone covering faces minor, whole slew communication recognition practically eliminated...

Maybe Redditor thing, sure what's y'all. That’s heterogeneity spread models saying would happen awhile now, people don’t like models sounds suspiciously like herd immunity dirty word pre-vaccine like we're going wearing forever.

bro still take shoes airport dude tried put bomb shoe 20 years ago. Nothing permanent temporary government program 30-70% HUGE range. Like ummm narrow bit? hate mask. agree we're ready get rid mandates. till everyone gets vaccine opportunity. I'll burning mask :) Reddit full tech savvy people, people work work hands dont even know reddit Good. I'm starting feel like people worry following rules jumping line. someone give vaccine take it, 100% accountability recourse get sick local government can't vaccinate also expects teaching person. like elections held weekend rather Tuesday, vaccinating days week would increase access cannot make weekday clinic due job/housing/childcare issues. even gotten close vaccinating 75+ age group here, let alone teachers. nationwide numbers look promising, actuality feels like lot places we're getting vaccines people need most. live VA married teacher. official policy VA vaccinating teachers, places execution clusterf*ck reality.

I agree \*either\* statements! Minnesota 35% 65+ least one dose now, they're prioritizing teachers addition healthcare think pretty much correct assumption. hope we're north 50% end February. doom gloom confused reality. 

Nope. Often people completely ignore reality often substitute efforts doom gloom. Sure, doom, it’s pretty fringe.

It extremely common here. fringe. objectively minor inconvenience. takes like 2 seconds put unless running marathon really impact breathing. people making fuss wearing mask histrionic really deserve empathy.

There might rare medical issue prevents small amount people wearing mask, somehow doubt tens millions anti-maskers medical issue like that. refund people test positive. -70C cakewalk even Mexico.  anti-vax, shoulda said it. Stop “foreign substance” bullshit - it’s medicine. government requires licenses ensures basic understanding safety protect drivers. principal applies - vaccines required protect society whole. 

If don’t like licenses, currently require vaccines attend schools colleges. Extending areas COVID makes excellent sense. citizen wants selfish get shot, let choice, let ruin things everyone else.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* cannot comprehend sentiment almost think joking. like wearing mask?  know it’s representative sample guy NY basically saying goes testing center like every week because. Additionally see places requiring there. random guy middle South Dakota probably gonna drive hour nearest testing facility fun. Even he’s mildly sick probably not, wouldn’t want sick .

But yeah sit front grocery stores offer people $20 test you’ll get low positive rate guess. What’s point though? Lots people probably comfortable voicing opinions get viciously attacked even suggesting something goes mob. still learning that's fresh data really reasonable question assumption made.

If seasonality major driver would explain places like California Florida similar numbers certain respects despite wildly different philosophies.

That would also suggest that, short full lock down, probably less control virus think short vaccines. hardpressed find **something** people agree on. explain major issue? 

If mask uncomfortable slips regularly, sounds like poorly fitted mask.

I also read people autism physical issues wearing mask. physical sensation mask face drives distraction. Unfortunately, kind thing commonplace vaccine supply. think people would problem forced stay quarantine facility weeks people problem properly quarantining home weeks.

That quarantine facility closed. always people trying 937 cases 9 deaths total. think want see another advertisment this. wear one want. wearing one, outside times year need go public sick hell. Queue conspiracy theorists.... would boosters?

What becomes basically flu shot get every year? haven’t prove flu vaccination go big events?

If risk overflow hospital capacity even worry it? Why? friend dad’s started wearing large red “V” vaccinated coat ala scarlet letter. really wish joking, he’s kind eccentric dude. really something I’d encourage, thought funny enough share. That's Wuhan Institute Virology, virus found first. up” already.

Opening up? Who’s closed down? country, pretty much whatever you’d like. Restaurants open dine-in, people weddings, stores packed. It’s irresponsible I’m avoiding possible, country never *really* locked down. 

But no, many people infected already, warmer weather coming vaccines picking speed, genuinely can’t see things getting worse here. schools still closed, seems many states already reopened schools prioritized teachers done anything make sure teachers vaccinated *before* go back in-person learning. situation seems fucked up. Masks minor inconvenience have. understand people arms them.

I'm totally disagreeing I'm fine wearing mask longer, real pain ass younger kids trying make sure clean, wearable mask try get lose constantly. biggest issue them. Serum also part Covax effort people like Bill Gates put money.

I know sure, India playing diplomacy doses Serum owes anyway  yeah Canada although really small production number remember correctly starting run months. think expanding early 2022 though. Yeah opportunities South Central America Christmas travel absolutely seem made big impact, although I'm sure vaccines part well. 

Avoid unnecessary travel, get vaccinated solid takeaways. expect next.  cases extremely rare. fear monger spread misinformation please. trial enrolled kids, would say would good option kids not. can't they? possible reason upset people use masks? listing UN health agency comes days panel provided interim recommendations vaccine, saying two doses interval around 8 12 weeks given adults, used countries South African variant coronavirus well. established emergency use listing (EUL) process help poorer countries without regulatory resources quickly approve medicines new diseases like COVID-19, otherwise could lead delays. COVAX Facility, co-led GAVI, World Health Organization, Coalition Epidemic Preparedness Innovations U.N. Children’s Fund, said doses would cover average 3.3% total populations 145 participating countries. think agreement Canada actually production there. also imagine lots opportunities South Central America. prove effective panic now?

The Oxford vaccine 10% effective South African strain according like still salty AZ delay? knowledge, every country experienced similar delays, worse.

Yet many countries export bans allow private companies manage production? 

No, communist China Russia... actually exporting vaccines lol... guys... yeah.. that's right, USA UK. allow private companies export vaccines, talking contracts shit xD Development economics says need consistent loans help stay growth curve fall back due depreciation made claims. possible conversation one country without whataboutism everyone else does. We'd better place people thought like me. least wearing masks.

We could South Korea even Japan (which share pandemic-related issues). But, nope, let's aim 500,000 confirmed dead tomorrow. Yeehaw! brainworm detected Going make thing wear feel ill. are.

Thanks though. vaccines work. vaccines provide sterilizing immunity.

I think it’s highly troubling people like can’t wait inflict restrictions lives certain persons. vaccinated leave others alone mind business. think says something consciousness whole certain people relishing idea people longer able participate member society personal beliefs preclude taking vaccine. 

Get vaccinated, move on, mind business gods sake. Ya chinas vaccine approved dozens countries Indian here. mention it, friend. We're together. Fauci highest paid government official?

This I'm pointing out: currently EU - largest vaccine producer - China, Russia India, ones exporting vaccines global scale.

While UK USA export bans, still get vaccines Europe. One hiding behind Trump executive order (which Biden revoke, though chance it), UK ""contratual obligation"" refuse comment share information about. Two effective export bans. could months vaccinate ‘at risk’ people. legitimately put ‘hard border’ lock people country then? It’s ludicrous suggestion.

Australia year thing, adequate facilities processes safely facilitate Australians entering Australia substantially minimising risk rest community. It’s failure government haven’t able so. Lmao india well known reputation exporting cheap generic drugs. People know ignorant I'll bite. Explain he's wrong, please detailed possible. Ok India isn’t exactly good guy international politics. Good instance and, I’ve seen, pharma general. Still, cautious anointing India good guy overall. doubt it. We’ve variants Vietnam well still cases day. vaccines coming end month, one really cares since everything basically normal. That's actually true. Modi respect supporters India things India different US. BJP party India also support parties India, face much backlash. got overwhelming support 2019 general elections see many people like voted him. mostly faces criticism opposition, job opposition. live republican state faced type backlash. Nearly children die this. restrictions end? start now? wait longer? even useless vaccines widespread. Again, Pfizer Moderna doses available time. horrible crisis, every vaccine greatly reduce hospitalization death needed war-like effort beat virus. groups decline vaccines, given next group priority list. I'm afraid two things. Unforseen logistical issues arise frighteningly large cohort people going get one. Either due fear vaccine, political nonsense, sheer laziness. UK much fear new strains?

Vaccines prove effective panic now? easy, look happened US. People can't sign confusing locations supplies loaned across states shortages. don’t care know I’m sick, I’m wearing mask pandemic over, sick something. people used think anyone wearing mask bubonic plague like, swine flu. I’m hoping becomes normalized wear one whenever someone isn’t feeling well, even it’s common cold. Yes people know. uncle got vaccine, printed veil. got made Bharat Biotech.

Vaccines prove effective panic now? ? going address people actively infected outliers harbor virus months. I’m saying kill suspect incubators evolution thing.

So...how exactly propose ""address"" people?  ""I'm saying kill people"" - clearly thought occurred you, mentioned all. 

I think understand disturbing line thinking is. might say something masks think wearing mask daily interactions dehumanizing.

Me? treat people masks way would (prepandemic). Because, know, people people, right? Every contract fulfilled, yet EU contracts missing deadlines deliveries, overall breach contractual obligations - hiding behind production problems, reality favoring contracts others.

Seems like still salty AZ delay? knowledge, every country experienced similar delays, worse.

The UK originally planned get 20 million doses September 2020. revised 4 million January 2021. UK received 540,000 doses 4 January 2021, 13.5% revised order 2.27% original.

Main difference UK ordered 3 months ahead outrage big pharma resonating Europeans, realized fucked big pharma seeing vaccines materials moving EU vaccines delivered.

The EU also signed contracts Pfizer November 2020, many countries ordered July. protected people economy. worked them. they're properly vaccinated, I'm sure they'll open cases, that's different population protected. selling point! Let's get vaccinated put behind us. makes sense, gives feeling idea talking about. vaccines create potent immunity far antibodies surviving normal infection does. AZ vaccine even protect SA variant surviving previous infection would protect even less. Lol that's cuz india forces pharma companies list drugs generic prices  yeah armchair experts getting loud annoying, anyone bothered read shitty article call caution rather panic. scientist worth salt make director level spouting baseless claims. fauci nothing gain making shit Honestly, Matpat interview made stop trusting Fauci. Someone caliber stuff like that. pharmacist gave vaccine mentioned take Tylenol ibuprofen getting it. Altogether seems varying opinions it.

Sorry, even becomes acceptable that's going happen. so, broadcasting everyone probably sick, behave such. Bay Area much lower caseload much pandemic, we've also much strict lockdowns restrictions (I live San Francisco). manager work moved San Diego quarantine said like totally different world.... went 90%+ people Bay Area wearing masks public maybe 50% San Diego walk.

Very different attitudes there, socially politically seems. nearly different as, like, Georgia Florida though. apple worm it, unacceptable. I’m going go drink puddle baboon diarrhea instead. late recant. I'm Indian.. know country. OK. claim it’s second best vaccine, know that’s flat lie? Everyone talked thread talked they're also wearing masks can. Literally every one. control group real-world use vaccine. AJAJAJAJA comerlaaaaa sarcastic - stand everything said. Thanks! talking time danger, asymptomatic rates, infection rates known all. Nobody advising wear masks back unless best guess might help data support need masks general public.

You keep reaching taking comments context want, recommend getting educated matter instead.

Here's info matter since idiots like Trump also tried take Fauci context like Fauci, along several US health leaders, initially advised people wear masks, Fauci later said concerned wouldn’t enough protective equipment health care workers. also early pandemic public health experts fully knew contagious disease Fauci explained time, “we aware 40 45% people asymptomatic, aware substantial proportion people get infected get infected people without symptoms. makes overwhelmingly important everyone wear “So when people say, ‘Well, change stance? emphasizing masks much back you didn't -- and fact even said shortage masks?’ Well data very, clear,” “We need put nonsense behind us ‘well, they keep changing minds,’ ” Fauci Fauci’s comments, occasionally sought reassure Americans early days virus, consistently advised follow CDC guidelines things could Well 74.3% population 18+ technically could hit herd immunity every adult vaccinated right?

I really hope vaccines ready kids fall. following trials there. Funny way saying ""I'm racist fuck"" think 35% Americans completely isolating? current weather conditions, good KN95 epic! Keeps sinuses drying freezing, etc. whether protects COVID. Can't understand self-respecting virus would want crap anyway... understanding interview FDA approval may come somewhat sooner (assumption previously time March). making impact, expecting provide [110M 

It may major player first wave states, think it'll player, simply delays probably happen one three likely approved point time \[if U.S. enough, donate purchased doses countries, course may end happening regardless\]. you. weird people insist wearing fedoras weird people insist wearing masks COVID long gone. another link appears working reason cases going several fold. really know hit is. 35% people almost completely isolating others. vaccination considered reason cases falling. likely combination people traveling Halloween New Year's travel pattern stopping well possibly seasonal effect well people gone lot already getting virus natural immunity. Natural immunity perfect quite strong this. others start get back society 35% largely isolating, cases rapidly spread again.

Having said believe worst Sure lasting health effects still thing. issue efficacy 72% better 0%! Well many want schools going ""like normal"". used teach Kindergarten tell every school worked in, social distancing would impossible class rooms sizes tiny, working tiny children also means would super hard socially distance like close you, would hard keep masks long. So, thank goodness teaching year, were, would want vaccine. would super high exposure rate around little kids! boundaries typically packed sardine classroom sizes. One Kindergarten kiddos brought H1N1 pregnant second, literally almost died it. actually still blood pressure issues it....so teaching year, would quit risking teaching Kindergarten. 

Also, helps workforce schools open consistently. open since August go hybrid schedules high numbers schools. Teachers take sick time quarantine, one wants come sub pandemic little kids already kinda gross, combine classes even kids one room, leads kids getting higher community spread, and/or go virtual due lack staff, parents get mad either call sick...or parents get sick call sick...... So, opinion, vaccinating teachers keep kids school consistently therefore help lots workforce stay jobs consistently....all opinion though! Counting days til Music Box Logan Theater open dip.

This WAY ""just dip"". numbers dropped substantially consistently 5 weeks now. going much worse been.

More people getting vaccines productions ramping case free fall, still think going get ""much worse been""? Probably not, get upvotes threads go king I'm really not, would take safe vaccine offered me, would likely cut chances severe case. Well native english speaker. aware sharing hippy connotation US. companies share results, resources sometimes even workers.

If everything simply business deal say, earth US allow exports vaccines (as country world btw.) ? Ok firstly I'm US can't comment - I'm UK similar issue PPE spring 2020 - eventually start producing locally UK government criticised ends earth PPE needed - blame Peru India lack PPE - sure point Technically export bans. UK signed contract AZ gives exclusive rights first 100 million vaccines produced 2 factories, believe government invested into. Here's article UK consider retaliation export controls EU began theirs. US similar arrangement Pfizer, Moderna AZ, accepted money Operation Warp Speed. US receives exclusive rights certain amount vaccines exchange money. ""Pfizer joined Operation Warp Speed July 22 received $1.95 billion U.S. Department Health Human Services, supporting large-scale manufacturing distribution 100 million doses vaccine. option would allow 500 million additional doses well.""

Trump signed executive order December, would prioritize domestic orders instead exports, mostly symbolic country signed contracts produce vaccines within US. time, EU considered safer option. still assumption “herd immunity % goal” still haven’t come solid number. 75? 85? 95? one knows yet. Also stated cases falling less 10% citizens double vaccinated. Look data trends scientist putting together shit news spewing I'm confused ability someone like mom work remotely someone better suited classroom works classroom, like teacher's aid. There's reason work. reason knew took test son's class quarantine. Zero symptoms actual infection (had super mild post-Covid stuff, brain fog fatigue). assume entire household since son definitely did... single person showed symptom. Cases risen ands fallen relation mask mandates masking rates 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ said who?

The remotely similar ""data"" found says imbecile Calderon.

As far Fauci’s personal incompetence, lying Teachers important economy. Lack childcare hurting many people workforce. insane people see teachers priority Go ahead delete parent comment. Take responsibility error judgement. People seriously idiots can't imagine successful policy successful much moderate comment expected, truthfully. 

Adding new disposable item already massive amount disposable items use daily increase amount debris landfills, worse, outside landfills. 

N95 use medical setting trained personnel following proper donning/doffing protocol equal random people wearing cloth masks 3 months without washing them. Like said, mask mandate effectiveness demonstrated rigorously mask effectiveness laboratory setting. Larry King die covid covid complications person since June 15th, way vaccine rolled here, I'll lucky September. prioritize smokers person educators, really show little give shit teachers. Nah, days usually take mask sneeze elbow tissue. usually cough mask unless like super wet cough. since mask controls particles stuff could spread cold flu talking people whatever, mind wearing couple days public So, demand first 100M doses vaccine they're making?

Distinction without difference. thought technology biontech target bankrolled Pfizer. it’s pfizer vaccine Haha US bad, funny original. /s

Idk us working inoculating citizens first think export bad thing. basically bank-rolled whole moderna vaccine much help Pfizer ramp up. shit-ton ordered I’m sure we’re done vaccinating citizens, we’ll donate rest - don’t, much salty you’d like. 

We got hit pretty bad COVID (and everyone seemed fine making fun too) excuse focus taking fire house first focusing neighbors. Um defending science would communicating facts public rather strategic lying masks/herd immunity thresholds/etc., lie domain politicians, scientists... Why? could better? circumstances hard  Could fucking condescending? Donated charity understanding doses ready go point UK approve countries move. bet fun parties. THIS. Everyone talks safely reopening. includes vaccinating teachers. sister high-risk, teaching person since September, eligible vaccine yet. It’s fucking nuts. 

This simplest step largest improvement toward normalcy in-person learning, biggest factor safely vaccinating teachers. It’s purely stupid vaccinate teachers. Poor baby can't handle differing opinions. Fuck off, Doug Ford! Stop selfish! killing Grandma! No. would mean test completed, payment for. know reason why, implemented way ineffective, really going matter. looks good perspective politics, going help health Canadians one bit. AZ? No, thank you.   Oxford groupies resorting lying again. y’all emotionally invested vaccine? done fast enough make difference U.S. good countries elsewhere Americas though vaccine deliveries much slower. what?

He bears much (more I’d argue) responsibility former administration incompetent response. deserve millions kind public service. Fauci figurehead. money went Pfizer/Moderna guys inventing amazing vaccine human history, possibly revolutionary innovation since invention penicillin, presuming able effective viruses well. think issues getting vaccines EU. fact issue motivated get production lines setup 'in house'. Summary you: 

Canada paid lot early. Gets nothing. 

EU paid lot research, little vaccines bit late. Gets nothing. 

US paid lot research, little vaccine late. Gets everything.

By way, US paid zero Biontech/Pfizer, mostly vaccinated BNT162b2 vaccine developed EU money EU Germany. 

The similar story UK. 

To vaccinated binding contract export ban.

Never ever. 

EU must protect first people, ergo future contracts binding 100% protected export ban. Thank UK US lesson. Double standard. 

Where argumentation masks available spring 2020? U.S. produce locally? hold government accountable?

Dude, okay, get it. America first good right, please stop wondering people criticizing behavior. lady walked back school reopenings thanks pressure teachers unions Lol wasn’t expecting reply. guess shut thread isn’t business qualifications discuss personal matter. apologies happened million dollars Obama got along Nobel Prize? Kiwi here. I've completely normal year save weeks. say going zero worked pretty well. novavax available? Months-long delays would cost lives delay economic recovery.

This understandable SA given inefficacy SA variant, countries would better using AZ (if needed) re-vaccinating later IMO. ""lacking empathy"" Shaft! places never really shut first place. hell not? Certainly far better country US China w.r. intenational policies it? Yeah except one really enforcing mask mandates. won’t get 20 cops jumping wearing mask walk right past TSA. Nah, dude. Landlords profit system set marginalize poor. Sure, government housing bad, could much better. Things overall could much better, people stuck defending things are. really see point Canada getting vaccine they're going get fall blunt. production capability really matter company survive supplying production facilities really matter. Canada start getting doses like May move needle. otherwise might well wait US UK finish get Pfizer Moderna vaccines. South Dakota fine. deserves though  Yes, big pharma US evil want profit people use taxpayer dollars develop drugs sell obscene prices esp poor countries.

India always looked people vs corps.  Yes no. large partisan divide going cause danger continues hold. something like 90% Democrats wanting vaccine 50% Republicans wanting vaccine US. That's going create pretty big problem road. hope Republican uptake gets like 65 70% least. Okay hope right Last read seemed like aiming fall time frame unfortunately soon enough many people. Unfortunately, Canada almost vaccine production capacity least give ability produce own. need boosters future they'll well prepared least that. could done much better.

But won't. little reddit post much effort willing change anything. know makes disappointed disgusted? Watching americans tell us fucking awful country fuck make better. gotta sit listen shit hoping elect someone looking bomb fuck us. Idaho done roughly 25% eligible 65+.  LMFAOO brother think see winner, deleted acc. Im glad safe (not snark) Wow. 100% even gotten dramatically better there’s reason assume won’t keep getting better. average eyesight isn’t needed read numbers, idiot incredible news. Demand still outstripping supply U.S. states. point time there's thing many approved vaccines. trust Lord Fauci since kindness heart. 

Oh, wear three masks safe stay ahead curve never flattened...  many COVID cases symptomatic, mild symptoms, look like diseases, surprise safeguards SARS-like virus catch it. SARS faster far deadly progression, that's people lookout for.

The thing finally made people wake take notice COVID extent ease spread; that's something really notice already taken hold.

It's also big part many countries dropped ball even watching happened Wuhan. COVID case fatality rate of, what, 1/20th SARS? infects order magnitude people. virus wins playing long game, time realize that's what's happening late stop it. Well, yellow booklet, cover says ""World Health Organization"" ""International Certificates Vaccination"". I'd say ""some sort vaccine passport"". :-)

Glad hear might get something little useful travel though, states agree it. absolutely unfair, although administrator told shit gets bad, go help things like man doors temp checks, check in, etc. Yeah sure, better technology. exactly point? course does, anti-vax / anti-mask crowd presence rise exponentially past couple weeks. They’ll upvote anything confirms bias, sources required articles get published every single day? know already? known weeks?? news!! ""Welp"" number plumneting every month, many polls say different things issue Cool, I've updated previous comment bunch links. 

No one trying dox to. Pointing bunch times pushed heavily flawed narrative, obsessively even doxing. need look meaning word. 

And dismiss Canada link shows pushing clear narrative. Sorry, keep yelling. Maybe actually leave comment people see pushing? 100 percent. trying cheer family good news honest would rather pessimistic pleasantly surprised. get 100 percent. That’s almost always life one instance I’m bit optimist. Corona never end ignoring possibility permanent damage long covid. 500,000 dead Americans, event war history country, still think Fauci's edicts wrong? uneducated opinion deadly virus would been, taken appropriate precautions. science, barcolounger politics. Ahh forgetting people reddit seem know better scientists. Two millions big deal. Friend mine got fever hia vaccine. He's alright Looks like they're legit vaccinating industry teachers.

not really surprising. indiana like south midwest. two weeks^TM gets upvoted fuck lol delhi surge Oct Nov. died that. 0-2 deaths daily nowadays. Same... think tipping point quite people, too. see masked outside 28ft distance? quite yet

Whenever see stuff like I'm convinced people want see individuals anyway. Actions speak way, way louder words. It’s definitely *most* restrictive, definitely restrictions walked back first keeping mask mandates place - restrictions like mask mandates, social distancing requirements, stay home orders, lockdowns, gathering limits .... mask mandates *are* least restrictive easiest keep place.

However, sub needs start little honest masks, especially love pull line “*ugh, they’re suuuuuuuch minor inconvenience don’t get problemmmm*”. addition obvious reasons comfort level (I don’t care don’t mind them, others do), masks take away act communicating others. much human interaction communication facial expression, smiling, touch ... things aren’t possible mask mandates. It’s like saying phone call level intimacy sitting face face - words audio same, communication isn’t. tell every single person moment share people going forward involve half faces covered take half experience away, yes ... “just annoying”. one really knows. details never released public. experience like? coronavirus subreddit huge. lot active beginning, still million people subscribed. 

If can, go back early daily threads. They’re wild. straight month “Hey guys, wife nurse says hospitals empty?! says can’t talk it. think there’s something this?” mild moderate symptoms evidence suggest work severe symptoms preventing hospitlisations. still that's still win win. main aim keeping people hospital.

Also Novavax reported significantly reduced efficiency well 85% UK variant 60% South african variant. J&amp;J also reduced efficiency. Moderna/pfizer whilst said lab studies suggest works still working new vaccine designed new variants would naive think still offer 95% protection. South African variant seems cause lower efficiency vaccines albeit AZ. likely regardless vaccine we'll still need booster shots kind like flu never backed claim all. showed date garbage infographic that's completely irrelevant COVID vaccine production. vaccines fully effective variant, MRNA vaccines seem almost completely effective variants consistently predicted actual numbers. Estimating x2 every 6 days. actual numbers x4 every 6 days large error. model messed badly know detail. did.
Being programmer suspect actual bug software. That's pretty extreme view, imo. ""If there's even chance could pass on"" could used keep masks school/the public sphere years.

US, see similar 'new wave' rapid transmission coming months, vaccinate high enough rates, fast enough, relatively poor job testing (my local hospital wants $800 test!), we're terrible contact tracing (near enough nonexistent area), half us think masks political statement. So... gonna get run new strains, again. believe state variant! vaccine.

One things know China vs Russia China's external propaganda game anywhere remotely level. China devotes majority propaganda apparatus towards domestic propaganda propaganda foreign outlets Chinese. academics looked Chinese foreign language propaganda platforms like Twitter, find people poor grasp English tweeting low effort tweets audience propaganda accounts. What's more, attempts seem getting worse time, better.

Two things -

One, vaccinated old people first (second?). I'd willing discard theory though, may enough vaccinated soon enough effect big now.

Two, lots old people already got recovered died. Something makes wonder ""last long lockdown mode"" younger people. Removing funding doesnt solve it. Neither xenophobe ridiculous expect domestic businesses require vaccinations customers restrictions lifted. tens thousands people packing indoor arena we're well past point gauging risk according individual's immunity. virus still spreading among gotten vaccinated many past infectious immunity. going end like flu, small pox. 22% efficacy mild/moderate disease SA variant. better approved US, especially UK/SA variants dominant strain soon. good Moderna, Pfizer, J&amp;J US *cough* Macron time, number living lives normally whole time gotten yet (or hid rest family), seems like always someone infect following precautions. lmfao HANG THERE. get this. last forever. hope :D I'm literally watching segment CNN right story Unfortunately that's world works. Rich countries money anf thus get first access vaccines whilst poorer countries lack money resources wait. Majority world still started vaccinations yet Every couple weeks? average couple per week. two third day back in-person learning. allow citizens die nations lacked foresight get contracts place earlier? personal, business. countries penny pinching, UK government threw shit tonne money Oxford vaccine.

In case, I'm happy ""the record,"" spanish exonerated flu proven come alternate locations 1919 - China shown involved release real (unbiased, unjaded, uncorrupt) investigation executed. Close! We’re likely running spreaders. people refuse wear mask caught it, they’re spreading anymore. damage it’s passed. 

The potential victim pool still huge. types comparisons always pointless. You’re trying find much signal noise. Like state dropping like crazy it’s going hard see evidence localized increases. think people freaking we’re top would wager infection definitely spread bars celebrations. source info Canada end summer?

Number 7 horrible number 'first world' country. Belgium even worse slightly older country well. It'll probably reach already. Thanks. applies section 5.4. 

Yes, talks manufacturing, we're talking keep saying UK export ban, keeps true.

Well propaganda strong came AstraZeneca Plc announced large delivery cuts EU, told EU officials could ship doses factories Britain obligations contract British government, EU officials told Reuters said export ban place COVID-19 vaccines, repeatedly declined comment whether contract AstraZeneca prevents shipment doses export bans, allow vaccines go UK. LOL

How many vaccines UK exported, curiosity? Eh, [most studies nowadays showing pretty long immunities natural infection. Zoom hangouts ended April May friend group. unless you’re hanging discord playing game, people either see person don’t talk. I’m gamer, there’s factors preventing seeing others right now, I’ve turned loner. course. straight beginning, probably could save many citizens. However think would saved countries. outbreak seriously taken hit face. EU countries signed fall. signed deals early august.   According county (in California), family member addition student tests positive, it’s community transmission, school transmission. course spread schools small use metrics. upset EU exporting COVID vaccines, number MMR tetanus vaccines make kind irrelevant. RNA vaccines new beast almost hard retrofit old plant simply build new one, unreasonable think distribution production shifted somewhat due plants built instead retrofitted. reaction second HPV shot definitely worse. Bad headache shooting pain arm 24 hours. first covid shot lead pretty sore arm two days. think disagreeing with? people sub ""old man shouts cloud"" level agitation. /s right? Right? What's alarming people seem totally content well. Like how?!

I feel like tide turning though based sentiments recently shared sub I'm hopeful people come senses realize absurd way we're currently living is. going complain article least summarize correctly.

The expert states four factors, one, causing drop opinion.

I dont mind people questioning experts least we're right: staying apart, wearing masks, traveling, mixing others indoors,"" Dr. Tom Frieden, former director US Centers Disease Control Prevention, said Sunday. reputable scientists backing not-from-china stories?

We top immunologists Stanford asking investigation lab leak afaik Weibo talking external origins surprise point? 

They basically confirmed already indicated based data countries Italy France found virus blood samples back Fall 2019. also bought paid them. bought Pfizer, bought Astrazeneca, bought Jensen, bought Sinovac. got 40000 Pfizer ""reviewed distribution process"". got Sinovac. course used Sinovac. like guys using vaccines geopolitical reasons. snowstorm weeks ago. It’s affecting anything anymore. And, yes, caused temporary dip reported cases, that’s what’s causing general trend Pretty sure infection rate went 70+%, mortality. Redditoids always saying stupid shit can't help angry everything. AZ effective South African strain. US looking using AZ fill gaps, dropped information came out. Oh man, live NJ. Grocery workers face face since start even considered high priority. believe that? Lmao joke indication children died it—a substantial number, flu lock for—who preexisting conditions? course, I’ll try remember reply update doctor says. I’d recommend talking doctors though! Asking second opinion here. currently junior student Singapore, looking go exchange programme California Fall 2021. SG vaccination program aims enough vaccines end Q3, number doses administered received widely available. odds program greenlit? looking forward summer programme 2020 well cancelled. hoping Fall 2021 programme, else prep work would wasted &amp; traveled throughout college. 6000 people died Wisconsin covid. 

Let’s assume there’s generous 100% undercount covid deaths. That’s 12000 people. 

At generous 0.0067 death rate. 1.7 million people covid 5.8 million people. vaccinated people risking it. So.... nonzero number ""cases"" 2021, nobody travel ever? Even though cases dropping dramatically now, rolling millions effective vaccine doses every day? I’d say bulk issue infrastructure wasn’t build top level, causing delays over. Per example, could filtered telework? Sure, that’s top bunch possible filters. Even best times going things missed, many systems cranked little time framework build off. can’t go add checkbox. recorded whether employee teleworking not? methods verification? much change priority? approval processes making change? Etc etc. 

And we’ve seen results following rules rigorously already: NY doses discarded stringent rules allowed take shots, benefit. never understood NY got number 1 percent begin with. basically setup front Walmart start pulling general population start testing. think civility bot would get UK placed order vaccines 3 months slow EU did, think they're gonna go? wife boat, can’t find anything getting one shot. find anything would kind reply share please? Trumps president anymore drop childish gimmicks him, love god? AZ vaccine can't give covid either. much China pay per post? thought work South Africa variant? problem invetiable change fact problem. never said anyone's fault, reply irrelevant. Can’t handle differing opinions you. open minded think huh That""s old news. UK/SA variants dominant strain soon

I've heard UK variant might be, heard SA variant. No. That's thing that's possible. would read into/project onto statement feelings started today? I've felt way long time. I've able, I've donating local food bank, knowing need ever before. This, despite furloughed six months due pandemic.

You assumed lot someone never met comment, assumption 100% incorrect. know people Reddit, know circumstances either, maybe try little less quick judge. yeah even ""best"" scenario tenured still uphill battle. tenured tracked hell postdoc/adjunct option kinda funny, ""he laughs last"" kind way. really piss Trump! Actually, #1, you’re correct MRNA variants reactive infection vs Astra Zeneca variant traditional vaccine yet, tens thousands teachers still offered vaccine. drill numbers, two weeks away gotten first shot every single person currently eligible vaccine, assuming 100% update. factor actual uptake, every teacher wants shot one days ago. said slower first, April back pace 100MM June post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Israel's PM right wing. Stop politicising covid. Yes casedemic bad. recording huge numbers deaths breaking records anything lockdown. Everything's fine ICU hospital bedspace occupancy highest history NHS close schools. world also flat, toothfairy real, santa claus exists I'm pub catch friends. Pssssst nobody wants hear part. Could specific? think American policies exist outside America, first thing comes mind CIA. Saudi Arabia evil 😡

/s sarcasm btw  vaccines cost lot India's, like 10x really thinking seasonality playing major factor across globe right now. Perhaps impacted seasonality last year initial year transmission, sure would explain what's happening now. coronaviruses peak Jan/Feb almost disappear fall. might get interesting. 

Or, everyone planet started ""good"" time. I'm talking vaccine production capacity, ranges lot pharmaceutical companies developed COVID vaccines, BioNTech, others still developing yet manufacturing point new plants specifically COVID vaccines put multiple countries, retrofitted

What seeing plants exist, many countries infrastructure place, yet somehow trying imply EU capacity production rendered useless countries develop plants? really understand this. BioNTech buying new plants, capacity produce 750 million vaccines, TOP EU capacity... like, EU companies can't develop/acquire new infrastructures? tetanus vaccines support ""the EU makes 70% COVID vaccines"" gross misrepresentation data used A) almost 12 months old B) related COVID vaccine specifically.

Nah trying funny get outlier example Tetanus vaccines, try imply part EU production capacity technology pointless COVID efforts - plain stupid. assuming knowledge infrastructure place useless, there's capacity development summer 2021, Sanofi perform late-stage manufacturing supply 125 million doses COVID-19 vaccine European Union

[What fuck? company making vaccine yet approved suddenly make vaccines BioNTech? this? Witch facility Marburg converted fully stream first half 2021 annual production capacity 750 million doses inoculation.

[What hell? There's new facilities think virus clearly control, states start fully reopening, residents states slow reopen demand quicker reopening process.

once people get taste normalcy (bars open, music festivals, concerts, masks etc.) especially summer, people country demand reopening. Good. Cases went almost every day September 12 November 25. believe reported every single one days. Chicken pox parties bad idea... past, parents participated “chickenpox parties” intentionally expose unvaccinated children child chickenpox hopes would get disease. **CDC strongly recommends hosting participating events. Chickenpox serious lead severe complications death, even healthy children.** way tell advance severe child’s symptoms be. worth taking chance exposing child someone disease. read transmission infection vaccination. vaccination incubate produce transmissible Covid question Spanish Flu lot deadly COVID, within timeframe. virus that's fraction deadly 100 years later—and better widespread health standards around—should certainly eradicated within timeframe. later powers-that-be dragging out, lockdowns like done much harm general population COVID would own. recently today - look date. gathering data got results. would think Aug time frame things much worse data seems accurate. mind deadline September. People going another year remote learning. Look comment history attacking user? real life? Quality matter. plenty people wanting quite awhile regardless location. i'm 100% sure asking, i'll answer two think make be.

1. vaccine cannot give covid, vaccine cannot transmit it. 

2. Even vaccinated, still possible infected third party transmit it. chances appear significantly reduced possible. exact chance known directly measurable without things like human challenge studies. We're wearing masks right collective risk understand high. collective risk shrinks, become personal choice. absolutes life, one either. Yeah, question. interplay Oslo accords Geneva Convention crux international law question here.

I pretend know answer. Same, planning trip months Nope. sub turning way much r/lockdownskeptism. Easing restrictions soon mean may never get back normal. Please wait government, includes smartest doctors world, gives go ahead things normal. say Florida, that's political decision, backed science. India's gone back normal even without vaccine,I think get vaccine here. Funnily many cases either, infection rates steadily falling even though people wearing masks less mingling freely. never going social distancing India anyway. guys worried passport vaccines? swear people sub act Orwellian. already need big amounts identification traveling overseas, what’s difference one little piece more? vaccine free US It’ll widely available everyone there’s excuse want travel. 
As Mexican can’t wait government allow vaccinated Americans country  holidays, new cases 'collapse' like said. peaked January. find number that's changed percent multiplying original risk 1 + decimal amount change. original IFR college aged kids 0.0035%. 0.0035%\*1.7 0.006%.

Although important keep mind ""up 70%"" means 70% maximum, necessarily likely number. mutates vaccine doesn’t work I'm VT school SLP getting second dose afternoon. feel guilty since majority teachers school older me. However, like I'm going pass either, nature work means really hard maintain social distancing, especially evaluations flip pages test booklet student points specific picture. wish teachers prioritized higher, plus side vaccinations seem going reasonably well, hopefully much longer people get it. Yeah, Google around bit find 100-200 articles Canada vaccination projections one better writeups actually published couple days ago right wing media outlet:  REAL reason probably already reached herd immunity large population centers. far 50 million people vaccinated (February 15th). 

The actual number cases things get tricky. current number positive cases 27.7 million. think safe assume catching covid-19 surviving confers immunity set period (months years.... nobody knows sure). However, CDC estimates upwards 100 million people US could already covid-19. 

If ballpark assume total number people exposed/vaccinated around 100 million (I'm factoring fact people already covid also got vaccinated) see herd immunity reached cases dropping. I'm originally Utah, NV, I'm glad hear this. make sense? Trump must livid. problem covid novel every existing adult. immunity it. Well every virus novel 1 year old. like 100 bugs come immune systems fight off. Well according UK it’s thanks effort India this. thank uk. Forgetting time allowing exports. already anticipate reactions extreme right wing bois... principal one county high schools literally put yardsticks floor classroom, desk desk, show can't miracle space social distance. Parents care. School board started care outlined financial liability would one teacher hospitalized. No, I’m saying Israel purposely poisoning Palestinians tainted Covid-19 vaccines. Unless evidence support statement, shouldn’t saying even implying social media. That’s spreading misinformation, rules sub. Yeah get teachers getting special treatment... 65 year old going work every day grocery store since pandemic started deserves get vaccinated 35 year old healthy teacher. Give break. Several worlds largest economies already said it’s happening. policy legs it’s really bizarre keeps brought celebrated solution people. Covid19-projections happen Japan lot Asian countries (ie countries wild monkeys). France UK obviously wild monkeys roaming around. 14Million 2 doses
38Million 1 2 doses

`14*2+(38-14)=52`

52Million doses ***administered*** studies conclusively say one way I'm aware of. likely transmission reduced, however may still possible. sure. Getting Moderna doses good trade somewhat less AZ doses. EU might completely done vaccinations summer, sure decent way herd immunity late spring. kebak variant Okay, yep, you’re absolutely fine. virus might transmissible slightly deadly, 70% increase small percentage still small percentage. Basically it’s business 2020 usual. 

I support bubble too, you’re good. Sounds like you’re everything right.  Oh? honestly reading much should, kept seeing AZ shot would need updated booster would make everything OK? booster really made AZ? path herd immunity calculator? keep seeing vaccines essentially useless

Get eyes checked then, biggest load shit I've read day.  I'm afraid state going super long drawn micromanaged ""phased reopening"" people keep saying even things open, people wouldn’t go anyway, probably haven’t left houses while. Yes possibly data seems reduces transmission know much. hate masks passion. wear them, never like them. Israel-based Dan David Foundation Monday named President Joe Biden chief medical adviser winner one three prizes said earned recognition lifetime leadership HIV research AIDS relief, well advocacy vaccines COVID-19.

Let's honest, end site. Even mass vaccinations goal posts moved still significant restrictions. Outside couple states, restrictions going continue long, long time. heard supposed go away Easter. People begin trust Australian skynews again. companies scum. Unsuccessful South Africa due South African variant.

Countries across world vaccinate anyone next year one variant likely reached us yet. top that, victims cut social support systems find much difficult leave home..

As cases fall, restrictions need well. 80 year old dying COVID tragic- suffering victims victims lockdown matter too. Thanks. Good know. available illegal access. Similarly US given blood donation samples mid early 2019. CDC analyzing late 2019. Double standards that... people set building fire get veto changes so... Yeah, that's dumb.

early pandemic, zips targeted mass testing. 

they tested every resident they've got solid demographic info.

those neighborhoods ""100%"" vaccinated 3-4 weeks. Ironically Mexico called NYT hoarding vaccines. Go figure. you’re telling near-weekly stories come showing Palestinian oppression Israel, well video footage I’ve seen eyes continually decade now, fabricated? Fake? certainly seems case numbers rate goes point. govt officials skewing numbers rates less testing. Fact still remains get test idea true numbers infections. ice covered roads days week..I'm sure numbers continue going down. effort reduce variant spread. South African variant seen resistant vaccines. would say bit extreme. full fucking year plan. 

I accept production supply bottlenecks makes sense new vaccine.

Areas country realizing enough people administer vaccine....a full year..how fuck up? guess tests short supply, asked same, contact, traveled China Iran, no... eh aspirin.

I still script doctor wrote. Fucking bs. also regular situation. visiting body going China tour nice new facilities locations. largest, devastating global pandemic faced society almost 100 years. treat ""fact finding expedition"" disingenuous, also trivializes massive, long-lasting, endemic impacts society. 

Your option of: meh, going visit, adds creedance idea nothing political theater, designed quell suspicion way information regarding virus provided world China.

I personally hate AZ countries option, afford time logistically financially variant appear work yet prevalent world-wide. us less developed countries take get better, hopefully affordable options available. Ineffective vs SA variant. Everyone got AZ vaccine get another shot sometime near future. u/j33 u/zmobie_slayre I'm replying you... yes ALMOST ONE DYING. 

6 million people die day starvation that's 16,500/day one considers global catastrophe... we're borrowing trillions dollars solve issue. understand cant claim one issue disavow another... I'm using scale.

When closed gyms leave McDonalds open clear sign shutdown nothing ""health""

110million people contracted disease worldwide 2.5mil died median age death 78 years old 1.87 underlining conditions. deaths healthy people age 75 make 9%. 

So let reiterate 225,000 people die corona were'nt already knocking deaths door.

Out nearly 8,000,000,000 people living earth 225,000 died. approximately killing 0.0000281% population percentage doesnt even include 140,000,000 born time.

Stats Facts dont lie. Almost one dying article mentions split elevator use one serves odd floors even, likely explaining reason odd numbered floor infections tying means infection elevator. media - ""new strains kill us all!"" Awesome! \m/ Yeah life goes on, it’s ridiculous stay years. child needs exposed greater world well immune development , within reason. Stop spreading misinformation. cheapest easiest produce still gives protection standards vaccines would. every country going able pay expensives ones AZ cost.  fact said it’s possible thing makes think it’s possible.

Otherwise, looks pretty possible still I’ve seen anything coverups lies. developed countries unemployment system that, least initially, pays percentage recent income.

Including US CDC info completely agree number points. mean realistic timeline, rather basic example.

I think still strive vaccinate many can, we’ll see works out.

One thing remember lot people don’t know even covid, get shot. Others want make sure get vaccine sure they’re better protected variants.

But overall agree number conservatively like 70% 250m great job outreach programs. Probably 60’s end 2021 accurate polling. Can't live one day without bars gyms bro People done. gave year they're giving more. pessimism, even scientists going dismissed more. Dude don’t think rights go spread disease killed half million people. Killing people wrong shouldn’t it, face consequences. Self quarantine right thing it, don’t face consequences. agree people shouldn’t jailed don’t quarantine, must enforcement. human rights limits. Also believe human rights peoples lives don’t get offended people call belief dumb, call is. 20% people die nursing homes... 2.8 million deaths US per year statistically 560k nursing homes approximately one every 2 minutes. it’s even better plan! Waiting young child vaccinated seems bit extreme point. Whatever model using seems working fine though. 

When 1 amount cases country going 1 amount cases country going down. get problem. US 16% now. Many EU countries 2-3 weeks too. weeks behind US terms delivery. Speed picking June-July EU massive quantities delivered. link?

Whatever investigators get link China, UK, AU, USA, etc.. compromised.

I keep saying people can't seem grasp this: investigation China. criminal investigation investigation wrong-doing.

It scientific investigation. Impartiality moot.

You treating like criminal investigation. Separate desire find someone blame, desire figure virus. wife second dose 2 weeks ago got nothing moderately sore arm. please, prepare mild discomfort! well known EU vaccine nationalist I've seen consistently post this. misinforomation. UK ""restrict exports"". export ban. Simply first 100m AZ contractually delivered UK, that's it. stated openly contract, US also stated intentions. EU stated would prohibit export people would simply made arrangements elsewhere. make distinction first place? Real question. lot people talk thread astroturfing botting. accused bot bad take. would point be? thread seriously important enough changing flow would make kind meaningful difference real world? seems like silly thing target true. Hungary Slovenia exactly bastions democracy covid-19...

Putting opposition leader quarantine facility going help government. wifi 4g quarantine facility, opposition leader easily criticize government inside smart phone.

I quite low trust government Belgium precisely enforce quarantines locked way late. let 20k people die good reason ruined economy want take responsibility (and destroyed strategic mask reserve 2018).

In Belgium abuse power (mayors rounding teenagers hanging around) public reaction corrected abuse swiftly.

I'm civil rights democracy feel pandemic lot discussion let delays necessary measures causing way many people die. Discussion important cannot let paralyse us right thing timely fashion.

It bit similar ongoing battle climate change. clear happening needs done yet governments hold endless discussions best course action keep postponing transition co2 neutral economy even though advantages. Like Germany building coal power plants? happen? Belgium also decided build gas power plants! 2021 closing gas power plants! Tens thousands people die air pollution alone. civilly discussing this, criminals getting away mass murder profit.  ...there always options. Mechanisms institutions usually protect women children men unavailable due lockdowns Thanks. also driving air travel VA vaccinating teachers. sure talking disagree, mostly government running show. I’m expecting maybe January. They’ve lying asses along way, changing predictions left right. state Maryland probably number 1 highly motivated state something like guess. I’m gonna waiting next January doses antivaxxers south sitting shelves months end, prediction think it’s plausible too. sure going look it. definitely go doctor’s advice though! reported Reddit “promoting hate” comment? eclipses, full moons... AZ great vaccine begin with. shame many countries fighting something bad. depends live - who's getting it?

I live Quebec (Canada), first doses gone people living seniors' homes health care workers. Pretty much everybody 80 who's gotten healthcare worker place direct contact covid patients (although there's controversy go place place - hospital sees covid patients, admin staff etc get vaccinated even direct contact). varies place place. Yeah thats asking. we're gonna start vaccinating everyone August like hope there’s fact STILL can’t get N95 mask average consumer ENTIRE YEAR realized would need increase domestic production. Total failure, America. wondering well, I’m surprised one else brought up. Basically saying you’re still going get unlikely know it, therefore still likely spread it? There’s way know since US manufactures many vaccines export many. unfair advantage provides compared wealthy country can’t even obtain decent amount (say, like Canada), completely obscures downstream successes failures system.

I’m saying problem US vaccine rollout, I’m saying won’t really able evaluate years later, all. Ok I'll bite. actual fuck talking about?

Being happy government helping vaccine distribution weird? I’m saying US shouldn’t give Canada vaccines start disturbing substantial portion American population received vaccine. America hasn’t reached point yet. Yes obligation world first obligation government country. It’s really naive think otherwise. highly doubt Canada would started giving away vaccines ahead America especially early stages pandemic you, worldwide hysteria overreaction. Lmao telling ""truths"" saying stop worrying. dumb fuck. young ones, good shape. know already. Bottom line, much better today year ago today. do.  best weigh two risks individual, can't possibly make rational choice without information. I’m struggling lately too. pervasive anxiety nobody likes anymore, something really struggled cut social life. past weeks especially hard... it’s absolutely dangerously cold live, can’t even go walk around nature anymore, I’m trapped house. acquaintance group social media gotten super weird last year, much animosity political stuff basically. don’t feel like trust many people anymore. 

The virus hitting close home - I’ve got friend COVID ventilator, don’t know make it. guy early 40s, really fit, athletic healthy.

I really lucky husband kid trapped me, least there’s people give hug. Yes, waiting two weeks second shot! I’m vaccinated (healthcare) parents got last dose. Husband vaccinated yet. I’ll go visit second week up, we’re careful wait gets vaccinated well (in case rare chance would spread covid unknowingly). Anecdotally, know large family close everyone ages got covid, except one woman vaccinated.

Are sure woman get covid?

Or mean say whole family came covid symptoms, woman exhibit symptoms.

A misconception vaccine can't catch covid virus. still can. main benefit vaccine prevent getting medium serious symptoms. agree NZ good, perfect. recommend look Taiwan Macau, places handle aggressive public health response without lockdowns.  least get vaccine save lives keep people hospital. states guidelines cdc right now. using them. Whether high income low income, way low income may many doctors sites, matter. High risk groups getting vaccine 65+. yeah, states following using cdc says. 65+, frontline health care. six weeks five British variant. think there’s not-so-insignificant group people sub cheer pandemic

This may well say others. doubt anyone openly cheering it, feeling defensive someone different policy position phenocopy feeling disgust someone wants pandemic succeed.

The sheer absurdity statement clue-in measuring something real, think measuring. bad news case famine. U can't eat ur neighbour American samples taken back 2019 Chinese samples taken recently. US like 340 million Anecdotal, late 2019 partner sick something remarkably similar symptoms COVID19 told doctor (during process arranging medical leave work) virus would get weeks. Yes. made explanation thing evidence.

More deadly. transmissible... Give rest. least 3? article lists 3, period. means 7 10 aren't. 1 already publically announced Chinese cooperative. don’t data back fuck maybe it’ll scare people. Exactly brother Wuhan November 19 conference.  Stayed across market.  recall anything ordinary Chinese city. wife got sick week return. That's crazy, daily case numbers flat, falling. 

It seems like US least realized lockdowns work. wonder Europe catch up. Thank finding isn’t data, article data. Forgive don’t believe everything that’s written internet. try search couldn’t find anything articles. NY opened flood gates multiple different groups group certain % vaccinated here. 75+ group extra two days 65+ group opened. That's CDC changed guidelines everyone thought getting flood second doses federal government going released (it didn't.)

For us, also health care workers, grocery store workers, police, firefighters, teachers, MTA, government workers, taxi drivers, restaurant workers, people preexisting conditions fighting spots. (Though, ones getting unions necessarily fighting availability since unions setting up.) That's 10 million people fighting 320k weekly appointments.

I think 75+ people stand chance get vaccinated competing people way tech savy. Minister Ardern, announced new lockdown measures Sunday health officials investigated new outbreak, Monday told RNZ National right take precautions, confirmed indeed cases infectious variant. lockdown first New Zealand six months represents significant setback nation’s largely successful efforts control virus. New Zealand closed international borders introduced strict social distancing rules early pandemic, thereby dramatically reducing spread infection. friend’s sister’s mother-in-law Finland allegedly died complications taking Pfizer vaccine- 66 apparently fine health. dont know details find more. wonder it’s possible may allergic reaction???! saying severely allergic people avoid it? (I’m still 100% taking it.) yeah, nothing positive coverage. course was. early intel came internet channels last Jan Feb suggested much. care virus point, ideally government should. India improve image, largest pharmaceutical industry world always going world's major supplier. over. dad still letting much. letting much I've vaccinated. Immunity seems hold UK Brazil variants, evidence South Africa variant show reduced immunity. Americas less affected anyone else world. Also, people currently virus, mutations happening likely new variants emerge.  That’s standard mortgage broker bullshit

Mine demanded paper bank wanting see deposit history 7 years 3 days closing. bank told get fucked. said wanted know kept money checking account

Have read study? co-author stated enough data statistically significant interpretations made matter mortality. Thank you! Got it. I've seen discussions various exposure levels different groups have, perhaps virus sort ""burned through"" part population never taken virus serious.

Person X wear mask, packs bar others like him, gets it, still give damn, spreads willy nilly.

Person relatively locked down, masked public, social distanced, that. Person might still get someone like Person X work, Person get likely quarantine keep passing on. don’t believe National Institute Allergy Infectious Disease? Pfizer lied! claimed 95% efficient saught FDA approval!! simulation jwiwnOwnciajwbdin2u 


/s Many states opened people BMI 30 above, pretty dang close average US Saved google. questions feel free google yourself. rates much higher vaccines rougher side effects. least much higher common vaccines. Long time ago last year, US exporting anything long vaccinated population. remember seeing big bump provisional Moderna supply Europe around June, suppose moment exports US supposed kick in.

US best COVID handling overall, planned vaccines well, starting early. headline incorrect. lines vaccines first day summer. We're going wrapping demand around time jabbing stragglers fence sitters waited.

The media falling drive anxiety clicks. Slowly surely calling data Fauci’s? It’s National Institute that’s quoted article. read it? Sure, was. we’re discussing vaccine rollout. Perhaps we're running victims practicing poor defenses ... Time move ranch insane mean many got start running people. state 10 million shit like 12% vaccinated last week amount people covid getting tipping point Trump signed executive order 8th december. Hahahahahahahahahahaha america bad wanted updoot much presssed arrow instead wrong sub? article US, comments are, none article saying. vaccines tested regarding ability stop recipient becoming ill seriously ill virus. signs vaccines MAY prevent carrying passing someone else, complete data yet. Regardless, following local national guidance leaving home / visiting people. Dude finite amount time planet want enjoy it, education staggered, social life stopped former job back home went business.

Once family friends vaccinated I'm going continue living life, mean I'll throwing 100 person parties? No, say vaccinated people meet fellow immunized friends stupid. still think China one countries able detect something like early on.

They population 1 billion. 
Noticing hundred cases hard big. tried CVS well? see they’re 65+ Texas well. Even though locations say fully booked, you’re persistent keep refreshing page get lucky, that’s got appointment dad. Give data!! well protected UK variant degree less protected SA maybe Brazil variant. Correlation causation... vote republican, bullshit 100% agree this. upsetting hope gov. something it. ""finally"" odd word context no? Colds definitely minor annoyance. weird completely ignoring it. see numbers too. US daily new cases back mid-October falling.

After months beating drum ""new cases"" ""new deaths"" every day things got worse, things getting better suddenly silence. maddening. Oxford business manufacturing vaccines. Vaccines, even close. vaccines effective known variants (with possible exception Astrazeneca SA variant). Daily cases world (including UK South Africa) falling extremely quickly despite presence variants. live US terrifying. No. People distancing wearing masks (properly) quite getting sick. low positivity rate shows ignored.

My personal guess weather anything. Perhaps we're running victims practicing poor defenses ... Well sorta... statewide mask mandate state Virginia example. choose comply consequences refused entry public place. compared vaccinated Israel similar set unvaccinated people compared rate infection. don’t think are? People commonly get reactions flu shot, allergic reactions time vaccine medicine isn’t unheard of. reactions I’ve heard pretty close experience flu shot(sore arm, tired, slight fever, headache). certainly looking like decent effort fullfil contract. AZ seems give shit Europe perfectly agree. I'm 70 wife several health problems put risk dying catches virus. pretty much isolating year mind isolating 3 months get mRNA vaccine. AZ convincing, especially consider new variants bound reduce efficacy even further. *  w r l  n e * can’t find anything US restricting exports. done? furthermore evidence suggest mild case vaccine include lung damage. vaccine greatly reduces severity infection. Severe infection vaccination going even rarer. China's negligence? role all? totally honest... former point. data, fauci shown always answers. don’t think he’s liar part conspiracy anything...just all-knowing, often disagreement scientists. ""The group concluded ""realistic possibility"" virus become deadly, far certain."" 


Yeah evidence available, I'm gonna stick fact IFR shifted regardless strain dominant. receiving doses ordered Pfizer Moderna, taking would stealing people's shit, good idea want trusted organization. EU exporting AZ, someone pointed lower comments, either production setup exports mind first place, EU ensures get doses ordered exporting anything. Yep correlation causation. distressing news outlets literally make facts conclusions publish fact. viruses tend evolve become less deadly contagious time, adaptation survival

TEND... However, current strains deadly. Well know. getting vaccines starters. instead lying public admit messed securing enough. Again, something better nothing + lying . UK US export ingredients vaccines EU.

The UK sends lipids Pfizer factory Belgium.

Sending lipids make 5 million vaccines week getting back 500,000 finished vaccines good deal. EU gains 4.5 million vaccines this.

If EU blocked export finished vaccines, UK would send lipids th US Pfizer plants. deal - send enough lipids make 5 million vaccines week get 500,000 finished vaccines back. EU would position vaccines all. seems like kind information would good know medicine given out. after.  cdc change way recorded like need two positive tests clinical diagnosis considered positive? Might want double check logic would agree they've done good job balance. noted though, never many cases countries last March. even countries handled things comparatively well, like Germany, eventually buckled weight uncontrolled transmission. happy NZ successful overall, like implied every country fare well failed due incompetence and/or negligence. complain state prioritized giving vaccines schools agree least hybrid immediately announce going stay fully virtual rest year *after* staff receives first shot. hyper-focus masks, people tend forget behaviors. guess feel mask shield invulnerability worry washing hands, taking extra time public places, etc. really wish advice given people common sense. dare speak negative CCP here!? still perhaps 30% population self lock year. Among high risk individuals could create small 4th surge still high community transmission relax soon.

However, doubt people relax good chunk vaccinated. lol that's trash take ever heard one. hospitalizations rising there's magical undetectable COVID strain there? seeing stories ""mysterious illness that's COVID causing hospitals stay full"". anger involved. Early evidence suggests variant coronavirus emerged UK may deadly, Prime Minister Boris Johnson Ughh don’t news articles every give data? bold claim could related many factors including herd immunity increasing natural infection (is bound happen), WHOs guidelines set PCR cycle count lower. anyone find data please share me! Seems pretty pointless now. virus widespread year, vaccine rollout going well. implementing policy try keep something already there, effective way deal with. NHS also splintered based England, Scotland, Wales NI. N Dakota confirmed infections 1% population per week peak, reality may closer 3%. 

Point bet 10% population infected peak month. goes long way towards level immunity. I’m sorry losses, I’ve going similar feel way. wish strength get this. know you’re stranger I’m familiar pain probably feel, I’m sending love. straight faced try say virus 70% deadly?..... coming lockdownskep cultist I'm confused... model produces R number, ""they ignore r-rate higher model said"" makes sense. 

The UK government messed called lockdowns. R number made public fine throughout. 

In September amount cases started rise 0 went 0 briefly BoJo messed hastily reduced lockdown R number still 0.9 political play everybody Christmas.

Then massive wave happened R number correlating increase cases throughout whole thing.

There problem R number political policies put place BoJo. - interesting whenever China questioned, automatically ""conspiracy theory.""

Literally less week ago people raving China letting investigators top comments smugly saying ""we knew along"" visa issue literally one thirteen member got resolved like two days. 

It's whenever China's questioned automatically conspiracy theory. there's fuck-load conspiracy theories crop approximately fast they're debunked, happening pretty much entire time pandemic ongoing. Positivity rate dumbest metric opinion. people symptoms longer care getting tested, it’s gonna stay high. way many confounders. least deaths hospitalizations don’t many although there’s few. find difference transmission disease severity. Dude. answer question, bot? bot... 
 

Pretty sad delete can't/won't reply fact 'cracking down' someone speaking truth....

""Yep, even whisker unbiased reality get labeled 'd\*\*\*\*r sh\*\*\*le living fear' faster could type sentence.""

Just curious, what's problem truth? can't imagine like real crisis lol. Whataboutism new pandemic. dunno he's saying true not, I'm say keyboard warriors, stating fact: I'm done summer locking down, I've really goddam strict now. worth anymore point.  shame many countries fighting something bad.

Well either governments world wrong understand something spewing idiocy idea talking about. wonder option likely. speak hospital part large healthcare network. getting ready vaccine show staff told make sure cell phone number date system. vaccine became available waited got text message giving link make appointment. texts went first front line ICU ED clinical staff. next round went clinical staff, non-clinical staff. two latter categories would almost impossible measure everyone's individual risk. non-clinical staff work registration desk see 100's people per day someone working home set foot clinical setting last year. Maybe small independent hospital everyone knows (does exist anymore?) someone could draw equitable plan. large systems likely used software run programs. point article comments theory one disprove China actively preventing collection evidence, extremely suspicious Praise trump fighting political left headwinds getting done us. Amen depending industry. trying break marketing. Mostly need NY, Boston, Chicago, LA. 

If someone lumber, need rural areas, pay likely would keep influx people make cash offers.  Yeah that. get caught stealing they'll cut fingers, smuggle drugs death sentence. They're especially tougher tourists Well said, this. guy absolute tool.

I'm certainly favour Tory government all, think majority handling pandemic terrible. think give credit due acknowledge UK currently rest world vaccine support nation (along genomics point out). need downvote fair question. 

Ohio ""found"" 10,000 deaths week adding slowly. added 1000 deaths one day days ago example. Ohio state this. Health departments swamped December catching up. 

Deaths dropping past week so. Common sense tr*mp supporter goes together like socks sand México, vaccinating like 3k people per day. 


Hopefully starts ramping soon likely not. Unfortunately case NYC :( Im thinking people stopped selfish sure last sentence. governments least 1 month head start. Thr Pfizer vaccine particular hard distribute poorer countries due cold storage requirements think people scared getting hopes up, they’re hesitant optimistic expecting things come crashing again. Sure think people clinging doom whatever fucked reason, lot people know don’t want disappointed. hope see light end tunnel! seem increase covid fatality rate UK compared Spring, makes skeptical.

This would good comparison, lot changed since spring. I'm pretty sure we've gotten better treating COVID time, resources available due year production ramping up, medical professionals probably largely vaccinated least immune contracting work.

I know, I'm guessing. But, think NHS would bit effective treating COVID now, compared then. lol one people referenced ""life, liberty, pursuit happiness"" which... constitution Seriously. naive, overly-simplistic understanding situation Europeans seem kind hilarious. ""It's made here, therefore immediately please"". No, really. belongs company makes purchase completed, companies work contracts. EU allowed work they'd set somewhere else fulfil contracts instead. mean EU cancel people's contracts seize all. Finally addressed public.

Basically EU, India, China Russia exporting world, USA UK export 0 vaccines still get stock EU.  Unconfirmed reports happening mean widespread something everyday people worry point quickening pace coronavirus vaccine administration, say it’s natural seasonal ebb respiratory viruses others chalk social distancing every explanation appended two significant caveats: country still bad place, continuing notch 90,000 new cases every day, recent progress could still imperiled, either new fast-spreading virus variants relaxed social distancing measures. mink news scary optimistic. Thank you, caffeine makes eyes jitter comma really helps. It'll rationalized cause death. can't stop people getting sick dying, covid different point?

You're estimating much people trying move normal again. making proteins mRNA ribosomes day, every day. Using non-nucleus derived mRNA going stress out.

I'm sure altered base, though. Imagine someone showing article year ago (when virus known widepsread lockdown begun) saying year super exciting news. wtf kind logic [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Yes it’s bum timing. Hopefully symptoms don’t get severe. Thanks kind words. best family :) commute two hours day too, getting time back sleep morning walk dog cook dinner night blessing. totally misread that, based commenter replied saying yes, could work treatment know exposed, waiting symptoms means likely already progressed far vaccination help. get info YouTube comments? 1 year old small infection fatality risk it’s irrational worry it, everyone exactly stoic calculating comes assessing risk children.  EU binding contract deliver X number doses exports. exactly exported.

Seriously right start EU could done easily. Pfizer would found somewhere EU could export countries. 

The EU never Pfizer produced EU. Really EU. Agreed. sort Zoom baby showers, weddings, happy hours... water depress me. I’d rather wait it’s safe real thing. 

Also, find hilarious beginning quarantine known “Joe Exotic” phase. seen several places appears ubiquitous. American government can't really much point simple truth people going forever, regardless virus doing.

If scenario comes pass, see us shift treatments keeping vulnerable people segregated get economic activity working. ***All*** last year. Back April saying double every 6 days that's model predicted. numbers clearly doubled every 2-4 days. lock soon enough.

On run xmas peak ignore r-rate higher model said. Result even higher peak early year. Zoom happy hours, game nights, karaoke, whatever...they go die fire.

That agree with, although necessary evil case something like weekly D&amp;D game friends college. live far enough apart would impractical play in-person regularity. “change into” ""common sense"" ""tr\*mp supporter""? OK American friend! Statewide blood testing COVID-19 found 2% Virginians antibodies virus **as mid-August 2020**.

Was article old recently republished? Maybe, even given change cases numbers snd - would lead probably best estimate 15%-20%. numbers still indicate VA path herd immunity slow vaccination rollout lend optimistic support higher claims either. know is, numbers increasing lately one point UVA model projected us 500k-1.2M total cases Feb-July. hope it’s less EU already ordered least 200 million doses Curevac though. binding contract EU? one broken, right? one worry unlike previous cases, source hard know. feeling going get lucky again, nipped bud. begin vaccinating border workers Sat get one may looking potentially less leaky border within month so. obviously conditional preliminary indications good transmission reduction, bearing out.  Yes, problems good one. really think J&amp;J one hits much easily ship pharmacies/offices freezers it'll really take off. conservative expectation 4 weeks away J&amp;J really getting going, mid march (especially increased moderna/pfizer supply), really rolling. end April pretty incredible complete vaccinations. That’s sad airlines get bailed don’t manage money buy back stock give ceos fat bonuses pathetic That's they're saying many cities tenant protections prevent ""no-fault"" evictions. means landlord cannot kick reason one talks US variant US immune variants. US went though worst period cases country. know variant worse everyone afraid us, variants started first. 

We stay locked forever, point going get vaccinated hope best. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article [It’s surprising It’s certainly staying home year. Cuba alway well set Pharma. Perhaps assuade AZ leaving Europe claim is, day. people think it, less we're probably underestimating. Wuhan December-March, much time barely tests certainly much pubic awareness symptoms etc, absolutely believe might 500 infections per detected case. hit 5-10% entire country confirmed positives, 2-3x might realistic. unlikely half US already infected. Yes absolutely consider cost.

It highly effective, quite par Pfizer Moderna there. (Depending variant)

The price per dose AZ 1.78 Euros, next closest dose Sanofi/GSK 7.56 Euros. Moderna $18, Pfizer-BioNTech 12 Euros.

No wonder India, etc mass-producing AZ vaccine, cheapest many times. J&amp;J would actually better older people. 6X% preventing illness, 100% preventing death trials. makes older people better vaccine go less less likely working (so less places could infect others less strain economy) end unknown long term effect mild/moderate illness, less time impact (ie they'd probably die something else first). Canada - run short Pfizer vaccine deploying first dose many frontline/at-risk personnel. wife frontline nurse, whose second dose delayed supply shortage. people even administered two different vaccines this! frustrating experiment world, sure. Thank information - good know we're dealing similar issues hopefully collective experiences improve rollout prevent spread virus well preventing wastage proven solutions. Good luck generic - hope helps country's family's situations. safe get haircut indoors ? Yea sure agree  ""I don’t think US vaccine issues"" denying obvious? sounds like that's saying, too.. Never have. expect massive reopening sometime memorial day July 4th. point pandemic whimper. probably sort real announcement anything like going happen. believe cases low enough go back normal basically able live normal probably stop enforcing stuff. Normal far I'm concerned. I've traveling, seeing friends, going gym, visiting restaurants, etc since April 2020. Insane. every EU citizen wants vaccine gets single dose exported. 90 95% normal know. Getting last 5 10% going tricky Total mortality went \~15% US last year, 15% families usual suffered death family. best year, also complete disaster portrayed media. suspicion schools person graduation spring nursing homes basically reopen everyone vaccinated. One issues many staff getting vaccines. changes going little bit tricky figure reopening case loads come down. it? impression fighting whether school person not. universities basically locked down. I've seen accounts healthcare workers sound pretty traumatic. elderly vulnerable get participate normal life US moment? allocating 100% vaccine week teachers attempt get done ASAP. hope you’re right pretty surprised saw videos wearing masks going about. looks like australia living life almost normally. far Australia concerned win-win. want use can. want use AstraZeneca facility used things sell vaccines Pacific rim region elsewhere. Even variant newly reported cases keep dropping every day. Maybe would dropping even faster without doesn’t like variant going stop us beating Covid. virus evolves, humans. year. think: newborn 11-month old babies alive? ones mothers survived pandemic. Flashy Bribe Israelis asked? agree somewhat continued restrictions. going one day calendar wake restrictions gone. Granted, every country handle somewhat differently US, States mostly decide lift certain restrictions, see complete ""normal"" year. tired Fauci. Last week said 80% Americans get vaccinated (80% happening), 'could' consider reducing restrictions. Note key word 'could'. Give break. someone smarter tell far we’re away game changing treatment ? Like, could see pill prevents severe cases example year already ? LOL added comas didn’t see till went get link. recent bc go time. even emailed contact found footer, asking add commas. website (now commas) *That’s half true elders hospitals workers wake everyday feeling free.*

True, bad year doctors, nurses people retirement homes.

* hug grandparents feel safe going store.*

Sure, can't leave country without asking government permission. Victoria also suffer 7-month strict lockdown. last year. Planning fly Mexico spring break. fly Mexico?

As grandparents - mine getting second dose vaccine week I'll hanging usual.

* clubs fully open*

I'm nightclub person, even Seattle still options: go private party someone's house (officially illegal, one cares) fly Florida party there. possible since late April, minor inconvenience. “State funded” said ""no one asking schools open without requiring masks **or testing**"". pointing true statement. generally don’t believe collectivism better individualism

And we're worse COVID every country. sense something greater good benefit fellow Americans, rampant selfishness entitlement. desperate make UK bad guys you? even von der Leyen admits EU fucked maybe admit too? Denial river Africa lol! Ugh again. Hopefully SA booster shot gets developed soon. anyone idea booster approved distributed? terrible already hear things dad going say Israel Fauci league lockdown hurt American economy like we're public health emergency anything. Daily reminder ""normal"" tier CA, lowest tier basically impossible unless rural county get artificially round numbers down.

It's time Newsom make plan normal, IMO. I'm afraid might though.... Cause Q said so. US Arctic blast keeping people inside right guess decided there’s need fearmonger moment. here's deal... plans reopen. What's going happen one day we're going go back pretty much full normal rapidly. discussion phased normal. That's bunch bs. going pretty much course couple weeks go lots restrictions full normal. Watch... plan plan needed. going decide cases sufficiently low we're good reopen relatively low risk. 67% said borders reopened vaccines rolled out. dealing international companies while, use commas, use decimals, use spaces, use nothing. Many swap comma decimal. Unfortunately there's common accepted separator. Lifting mask mandates accompanied lifting pants mandates.

No way nose/mouth exposed less dangerous airing penis warm humid day.

If like it: look away.

But single anti-masker going speak that, I'm convinced anti-mask thing politics.  That’s I’m account population. I’m total deaths. Let’s use 20 countries worse Europe want. many areas country, public masking pretty much visible remnant pandemic. Arizona live, people wearing masks, would idea day day life virus. mean guess besides fact still go office, that's company safe, there's nothing actually stopping opening office. Anyway, could part - many people/places, masks actually already last thing go, first. Always money. There's reason top comment. thoughts incredibly problematic reason nothing changed.

I think nearly much power think (or let's honest, should). 800,000

jfc  We're still ways away that. California, live thus pay attention, we've come \*way\* we're still higher winter surge.

If California's R(t) continues hover around 0.8ish, 2-4 weeks away populous continues starting drop tiers. seemed completely impossible month ago. worry, Montana, we're self-sufficient level headed, need mask mandate........or new governor claims. dumpster fire burns bright treasure state. immune escape potential less either P1 South African variant. probably cause relatively small number reinfections major source concern time. good reason. 130 countries planet even started vaccinating yet much Europe way behind schedule.

This leaves time mutations, idea mean.

I'm giving masks effective hibernation time soon, I'm way list first shot. agree everything said. seems like even though end sight plans goals end. example, residents staff grandmas nursing home received 2nd doses plans let building visitors yet. high school still unsure person graduation end May. Sometimes seems like don’t want get closer end even though it’s coming fast. ... exempted pay $75 annual fee. poisoning vaccines

Yeah, that's one dude guy saying prompted J&amp;J release June date press release discussed article.

Sorry, study used far beyond current discussion debate US.

Australia needs really high efficacy vaccine get back 100% normal 90% normal Australians virus. US many European countries, natural immunity, may somewhat slack lower efficacy vaccine. did, 3 days registration process website started working semi-properly driving insane. 

Im Jalisco, city started yet... Governor says allocated 58k doses, municipalities random guess depending people 60 living each, I'm sure going today work get doses.

My boyfriend's mother got call today get ready (in Mexico City), 63 last name starts B gives clue... Alcaldía allocated doses think close.

I understand political decision going straight big cities HATE IT, also think science oriented oh well... patience. large safety thing school attack years ago, means mask never normal school, add guy charge Sweden's viral response pushing mask usage Sweden imagine supply limitations Even I'm Twitter, fuckers still find way worm life. Making MRNA vaccines significantly harder normal vaccines IIRC. Come on. can’t possibly dense grasp massive difference Sweden US - including total population, population density, multigenerational households, high numbers single person households, compliance recommendations, ability work home, etc.

Everything normal right point parents saying goodbye ipad quarantined ER? owe kids truth--certainly there's line fear-mongering honest risk assessment. Nice Why?. wana hide year? Lmao, feel know boy Cuomo hot water covering COVID deaths due nursing home policy? Oh people excusing “national” requirement somewhat US seems pretty good (no seriously). get first dose insist scheduling second dose. AFAIK we've pretty good success getting people get shots.

But need one country like India encourage super-covid we're going pay price. Thanks global nature worlds economy, that's going stay there. days happens.

I wish world would unite bit harder ensuring stuff like happen. 

This low hanging fruit terms effort relative benefit. Pourquoi ? companies free ban mask wearing change operation protect workers covid? sacrifice workers say “You must caught somewhere else”?

It's impossible prove infectious diseases generally covered work comp. Probably lot people flaunting rules weeks ago back home due Arctic blast across US right now. NYT biggest reason - day tell people trust government, vaccines, scientists believe last forever.  write similar analogy think I'm at...trip 8 point! know... think least hear dingleberry guy entire planet ever lockdown single, preventable disease worker's comp existed?

That's irrelevant infectious diseases generally covered workplace liability. like rules change unprecedented circumstances.

Perhaps can't change retroactively mandate enforcement without giving paying work comp premiums change adapt. coping mechanism. People start convince positives bad things order keep going. Nothing inherently bad unless trying force logic others. 

It's important understand, remember comes next. next, lot people going get shock back reality normal returns. People expected never go back normal. Nah, 21.50pm. senior. graduated high school 2000s. Response facial cues generational, hard wired human nature nightmare end already...... UK importing vaccine EU instead accepting technology transfer BioNTech? Shiiiiieeeeeet, many billions USA invest European factories? many billions UK invest European factories? Cause getting vaccines made Europe LOL

They signed contract apparently paid enough. article Fauci says previous infection provide protection S.A. variant.

I believe without details that's literally said. one, Reddit not, ever wanted demanded endless lockdowns. 

What always wanted shortest period lockdown necessary.

Due people incapable unwilling accept seriousness virus various governments' unwillingness enact enforce strict lockdowns ***and then*** reasonable protective measures, we've endure fucking year half-assed lockdowns. 

A ***FULL*** lockdown, actually adhered actually enforced, period two months eradicate virus whichever area locked down. No, mean literally everyone literally stuck homes two months. means indoor dining, every single person work home work home. Everyone can't work home job absolutely must done government pay wages. Protective equipment measures businesses need stay open. Restaurants delivery take out, grocery stores allow curbside pickup. 

You get blame someone's shitty behavior lockdowns. COVID make people abuse assault others, chose it. 

Children catch up, bring bullshit never catch up. Furthermore, entire year, there's enough time improve remote learning younger children. 

The overwhelming majority failed businesses lost jobs need happen. government could paid wages prevent layoffs issued halts mortgage lease payments. 

But no. people said hoax, said affect anyone 80, wear mask, pay people stay home. 

We could stopped thing tracks done ***actual*** lockdown last March, April, May, June, literally time including now. chose to, fuck want freedom. 

Instead two months really shitty lockdown we've year fake lockdown people like you. cause thing whine. Bloomberg tracker says states atleast 13 doses given per 100 people. starts seeing effects this? already? bans UK though sides, whataboutism, logical fallacy false equivalence. One side wants people safe, side putting self-determination safety others. clearly right side ethically good everybody. 

There even transmissible viruses, possibly masks precautions.  we're recommending double masks. primary reason improving fit masking.

Anthrax Small Pox designer pathogens. lab release accident already existing human pathogen. build one lab first, nowhere near simple people seem think. Natural evolution still way better are.

And there's simpler conspiracy theory broad daylight progenitor bats passed intermediate species (probably something like mink economically important China, pangolins probably distraction) farmed animals created bioreactor evolve virus something eventually managed hop humans working farm. someone else worse doesn’t mean others aren’t still suffering   Marburg factory paid EU money. 

But factory deliver vaccines UK too. China. Now. 

But never ever. Build factory wait binding contracts EU fulfilled. pandemic, bro. going manufacture equipment

Mexico one manufacturers Well, according article quote Fauci, another strain COVID protect infected South African South Africa, people got infected original virus, recovered, got reinfected … South African variant — tells us prior infection protect reinfection, least particular variant,” Fauci added.

Now, clearly he's expert here, details, that's big jump go ""people reinfected"" ""does protect reinfection."" using logic, people reinfected *same* strand COVID know *does* provide protection, either they're leaving major information he's jumping conclusions push agenda. Yes, “social well being” part bit impacted. worth it? That’s debate always. 

That said I’m trying say CDC hopefully issue guidelines based purely minimizing disease costs. None us would like society resulted policy. compromise minimizing disease, mental health, social needs. 

I course fall different point compromise you, we’re compromising. goal always keep hospitals going capacity. Mid April? Pretty sure estimates 100M June April. Mexico produces necessary ultra-freezers. issue infrastructure, deliveries made. player US. End story. used South America Caribbean worldwide perspective that's good thing US perspective might well stop trial. New Zealand's economy grew last year.

US not, still not.

Just compare unemployment numbers, numbers mortgages rent payments arrers, whilst printing money entire time.

The US huge amount inflation coming, whilst still yet see growth.

Therefore, wrong embarassing.  idea talking about.

We long history government housing country, spread across 50 states communities kinds. almost universally disaster. idea government step build multiunit housing need equal parts ignorance fantasy. Long Covid mutations. media governments talking about, sure could miss that. Yes huge change deaths UK, start November 48k deaths Covid, 117k deaths. 30k deaths month January, coincides spread variant December country lockdown, lockdown November start January. people saying government full lizards. cares?

There’s way ever mandated say otherwise fearmongering. Maybe symbolic award (like cool plaque) would still better choice giving raw money. teachers given vaccines. virtual academy teachers, central Ohio. Спасибо. 4 masks better ! Lmao gaslighting. drama queen. ""new normal"" terrified of? People moving suburbs creating wider urban centers? WFH? Long term pandemic going effect ability party bar hop go movie theater, need wear mask everywhere rest life. 

If nearing death predictions come true, come back comment I'll donate life savings family. Grocery store clerks don’t option, teachers? Schools need reopen. Spanish suck dick lmao personal beef ever present PA announcements every store reminding us we're apparently ADHD cases let guard run announcement every 2 minutes. Even parking lot. support Fauci. He's smart man reasonable polite. people complaining need realize lot comes Fauci act government lead America Trump president. understand complaints Fauci, single handedly convince America serious president said not, certain “miracle drugs” dangerous used, correct politicized information CDC pressure agree previous admin.

People already forgetting many took Trumps statements face value, Fauci time one people government giving evidence based analysis real time, even analysis changed information coming in, know, like science does.  Look Florida lol, Twitter thread doesn'r represent everyone Give break. landlord owns property crafts civil agreement tenant.

She’s young old enough understand choice. that’s part frustrates her. also feel hypocritical telling controls body making conceal everything eyes.

We strong laws--stronger mask mandates--dictating wear go out. Hopefully sense autonomy ruined ""forced"" wear shirt pants goes out. Agreed. point wearing mask second nature certain extent. We've masked work since last March.

What want things better 16 year old daughter. want prom next year ( one year ). want quit dreading every email school confirmed case wonder going back quarantine. want quit worrying older parents father-in-law. want able go shopping without eyeball everyone else store. want regular Boy Scout campout take temperatures twice day remind mask constantly. I'm tired hoops jump work getting contractors onsite. I'm tired seeing friends family announce covid Facebook worry ... especially since gone. I'd like watch crowd scene movie first thing notice one wearing mask setting defenses edge.

If wearing mask 2022 thing keep disappear sign up! made 11 months (and, luck willing, 2nd vaccine shot) without getting it. don’t know managed that. Due work, around couple dozen people every day, specific type work (lot in-person training) means I’m super close contact people. us handle literal COVID + samples every day. I’ve least three close contact situations found well fact. I’ve careful worn masks whatnot, risk calculators tell gotten couple times over. I’m 90% sure I’ve never it, tested virus antibodies multiple times. It’s based luck. Countries successfully managed COVID used type messaging coincidence. housing supply artificially constrained, would need landlords. think carefully it, given artificial shortage, landlords nothing extract value time manage help *sustain* housing shortage. Landlords value extraction machines. Preach Since wear KN95 brief periods time, switch week. Lol love seeing antivax nut jobs try reason. 

Hurrrrrrrrr microchips!!!

Shouldn’t also complaining chemtrails lol. first article tells got COVID-19 December bills started pile up. 

Then read see several months behind rent. 

Right wrong, see judge might grant this. Tenant's perspective unfair exhausting illness final straw. Landlord's perspective hey, always last line get paid? Three months ""several months"", five is. feel bad her, five months lot months, sounds like landlord understanding, least three months behind pre-illness landlord evicted yet. might 7 months behind.

One qualifications CDC eviction ban ""Tenant must make effort pay least part rent."" I'm sure several people particularly NYC decided 2020 rent free since April. Landlords can't forgive rent forever. Since woman show trial, judge sees lot missed payments. 

Unfortunately going day reckoning soon. CDC can't hold rent payments forever eventually everybody 3 months behind going get booted time.

I feel bad lady I'd rather give GoFundMe tell landlord eat zeros. part means live free secure country. sick shit summer.  Everyone constantly complaining White House ""muzzling"" yet MSNBC, CNN internet news every single day.  appears cover fashion magazine.  wanted everyone think treated terribly used revel limelight.  constant intentional misleading made completely change view him. Thank you. Compared restrictions like closing cause serious economic harm, masks relatively downsides. 

I understand push first things go. Reddit, thank god, History.  opposed totally sane knife crime found elsewhere. Nah. one getting sick never goalpost. Oh shit, new one - countries invest billion infrastructures countries allowed get vaccines countries?

Shiiiiieeeeeet, many billions USA invest European factories? many billions UK invest European factories? Cause getting vaccines made Europe LOL ""forcing"" people tell obey rules? Similar resistance happens seat belts also masks 1918 flu. conflict happened businesses, too, private property respect private businesses asking safe making sense. 

Some people resist thing whenever people ask something, matter sensible reasonable rule request going be. 

The people act like bigger thing probably also fear bogeyman, fake invisible, fear real invisible (viruses, respiratory droplets potentially carry virus). 

There even transmissible viruses, possibly masks precautions.  we're recommending double masks. 

I wear mask car drive place place like touch mask face lot. demanded doses factories paid for. someone else set factory UK soil companies wanted produce vaccine foreign buyers UK separate facilities, could. Forever? European situation quite different US one. US general people care much hospitalized assume be. assume get virus quarantine 10 days lose income. would perfectly content US sent 100m JNJ doses EU. Would better used there. We'll already enough doses vaccinate every single US adult shipped April 30 daughter wear masks without Disney characters them. Like flat refuses. surgical disposable ones her. I'm fully vaccinated still love wearing masks. fun match outfits. daughter ripped mask floor bathroom. Fun times. Now, who's arguing strawman?

There options besides literally zero COVID letting COVID run amuck. Unless think places like Taiwan, China, Japan, Norway, Iceland, Hong Kong, Finland, Denmark, Singapore, letting people die.

Furthermore, NZ locking harshly UK variant; small amount regular COVID prompted kind reaction. Fauci needs permission Congress accept emolument. Perhaps granted that? worker's comp ever paid contracting flu, airborne diseases people could gotten work? would different? also suing companies sickness going thing. People sick Fauci constantly lying lockdown measures arbitrary. prevents hospitalization, that's matters. get picky, European countries shortages would take jab think learn lesson: trust Brits cut UK wherever possible always tries find abuse loopholes. Pretty sure Serum compensated way government restaurants indication, little time open bar inhibitions drop real fast.  depends country. everywhere that's situation. bluest areas surplus probably June July. Red areas surplus probably month. We're already starting see slots coming available week people would want get vaccinated. Theyre still free business. dont handle well, either shouldnt given special government treatment absorbed government 100 million doses delivered US mid April 🎉🎉 highest paid government employee America. Frieden Brianna Keller 1 PM ET hour (CNN). Frieden says ""there distinct drop cases early November, followed Thanksgiving Christmas spikes.""

That, course, even close true! US case count rising quickly early November! slope curve may HIGHEST early November! bit drop immediately Thanksgiving --- 100% patently false drop early November.

Of course, CNN host correct him. I'd genuinely shocked surplus vaccines people unwilling take month. said two, might shocked me. would recommend party favors. way could least pretty colors look better photos, God awful crunchy paper ones. assume everyone takes herd immunity reached number - yes.

Polls shown 50% willing take know NY data, long term care, 80% residents took ~50% staff. general public likely fall 2 numbers. Im guessing 150m-200m adults take (out ~260m 16+). high end puts us 60% immunity via vaccine. Exactly, look numbers N. Dakota state highest percentage population confirmed cases, peaked 1409 cases/day Nov 18th &amp; yesterday 63 cases/day &amp; Bloomberg vaccine tracker says 13% population least 1 shot.

The 7 day average co \^ THIS, I've noticed sub. :( informed. found outbreak media. that's know whether it'll kill you. reason shut world first need play game Russian Roulette it. someone who's higher risk category, can't say catch chill it. first sentence ridiculous thing I've ever heard. 

You child molester.

That claim made, using logic, true, made claim. proven capacity matters, claim made.

So child molester proven otherwise, claim made. 

Now, would think nonsense solid evidence child molester, hey... according you, claim true proven, so.. stay away kids. New Zealand Australia manage this. 

People repatriated Wuhan January put quarantine facilities. one talking ""detained will"" back then. exactly larger scale. Thanks!  extremely popular opinion here. You’ve picked correct circlejerk. _the vaccines_. **A** vaccine. garbage AZ one. mean, extent sure, apply evenly science whole. thing's definitely proven correct. Answer last question. happened Beijin June 4th, 1989. Reinfections rare, likely done good. Congratulations! Seasonality, partial herd immunity, result Christmas travel peaks. People care. I've gotten dumped downvoted local sub saying need prioritize teachers. usually prescription. Gotta fear monger matters: Rejected claims office employees, front-line workers, airline staff suggest hard prove infection occurred returning workplace prior widespread vaccination could present danger — less safety net — previously thought. they're saying: Chicago attorney Jose Rivero told Journal 30 workers' compensation claims made clients, including 10 cases employee died, denied. Mack Babcock, attorney Colorado meatpacker employee died contracting coronavirus, said handful claims pursued firm denied insurers companies. Checks Czechs?  Far less extreme measures taken example Hungary, Slovenia, yet see government hand powers back. 

There already is/was democracy Wuhan. I’m putting incoming travellers mandatory quarantine hotels (travelling choice), forcing people homes quarantine facilities one step away government enacting similar strategies round people don’t like. completely mercy point. Opposition leader cough, like example buys medicine someone else, grounds arrest (sorry forcefully quarantine him, they, government, clear him). something think happen. China benevolent government, best China, inhabitants per se. 

This obviously turns big ethical dilemma, someone quite high level trust government (Western European country fwiw), wouldn’t trust much power. conspiracy provide perfectly reasonable alternative occurred West past box Anthrax Small Pox? masks

You mean thing people wearing since latest last summer saw nationwide spike afterwards?

Or “well *enough* people wearing them” “we wearing properly” line cases going up. 30% population already virus. infections heavily concentrated people social connections. Also, 12-13% population vaccinated. numbers quite enough full herd immunity, enough significantly slow spread virus, especially combined seasonal effects. government blame, fuck fault less 1 million doses administered last 2 months? think article pointing policies considered charge reopening schools somewhere nonsensical impossible implement. think left handed attempt encourage officials re-open schools criticizing current policies. seem understand quarantine. sending people island fend themselves.

It's putting people hotel makeshift converted facility like sports stadium assigning personnel take care keep eye vitals.

They still need distance wear masks within facility.

As soon someone showing serious symptoms transported hospital, often much sooner stayed home.

The number people regular flu common colds low due distancing mask wearing.

In reality people broke leg went hospital chance getting infected dying covid-19 well. friend lost family member way Belgium. Whatabout whatabout whatabout.  rediculous want evidence claim? hypothesis ""Is Kent variant deadlier?"", single bit evidence tantamounts statistically insignificant conclusion, mean hypothesis correct. requires study. making conclusions little data irresponsible. That's ridiculous thing heard, really?

Even co-author paper keep pointing states data collected statistically significant draw meaningful conclusion requires study. I'll repeat again, data insufficient may well data proves. frustrating, know totally agree.

I guess know lot vaccine distribution, hospitals setting mass vaccinations anyone employee ID something? imagine system put place regardless differentiating telework employees on-ground employees difficult. 

I love hearing people got prioritized efficiency sake sake needs. Like said, know lot distribution anything could totally base, still totally make sense - especially system appointments made one way another. virus infect people travelling trains reach new threshold herd immunity loosened restrictions

In Delhi trains open long time Back spring summer studies predicted herd immunity would require 10-20% population infected epidemiological studies showed massive variations many people infected person Covid. idea people susceptible getting infected infecting people, perhaps job involves lot human interaction refuse wear mask, get infected first immunity protects rest population.

Those estimates seemed explain Europe’s Northeastern US’ summer pause cases, proved obviously inaccurate many places saw massive resurgences fall. might swung far way assuming need something like 70% immunity slow pandemic down. 

When look city like Los Angeles see massive disparities case rates different neighborhoods racial groups makes sense virus devastated communities overcrowded housing lots essential workers much population remaining infect would wealthier people work home. people harder infect aren’t likely infect many others infected (especially holidays over), restrictions continue place makes sense case rates would coming down.

I’m surprised article doesn’t mention this. would worried new variants cases weren’t dropping rapidly right now. point it’s hard imagine variants becoming prevalent enough turn around meaningful degree vaccinations become widespread another surge possible. clinical trials confirmed safe effective dosage is. Covid19 mutating, makes 100% accuracy effectiveness impossible. way slow mutation lockdown vaccinate stops infecting people. Yes, read paper feel there’s good reasons true. based said there’s “not enough data made” definitive perspective. nah still think china nothing cheap labor workers rice farmers, truly 3rd world country. 

what science technologies talking about, US numba one! first case identified November 2019

You know Chinese provide team access blood donation wastewater samples December 2019? kinds samples lead discoveries Europe. allowing analysis China allow legitimate conclusion elsewhere first. Still EU could supply 3rd world countries small amount vaccinate important ones - healthcare workers Checking Vermont. vaccine teachers (or essential workers all) state going age people 70 make appointments week. However, school guidance counselors, school psychologists, SLPs count healthcare workers many vaccinated. frustrating see teacher friends states get fully vaccinated even gone school person yet I've working person teacher since September zero hope getting school year. Yeah, got comparing openness Western Europe China? Step back take look arguement: attempting say China open rest world. 

There 3 million Uighurs would like word you. countless political prisoners would like word you. hundreds thousands dead prisoners whose organs would like word you. 

Why Earth world accept China's word anything spent last 50 years duplicitous, shielding reality geopolitical operations rest world? 

Whose number one attacker US government's Firewall? Get high horse admit China made reputation itself, refusal allow investigation go without hinderance adds skepticism. 

Also, make sure I'm wasting time, I've found shills can't answer question, apologies plenty reddit attempt derail discussion, answer this: happened Beijing June 4th, 1989? Even 800K vaccines, know government isnt going able much anything. guys vaccinating slow rate said 70% population vaccinated 2177. shame inept government dealing this. Biden Trudeau already discussing that. Canadian officials vetted Michigan plant delivery Canada. Novavax building plant Canada well. Hopefully, US helping neighbors soon. US 2 potential vaccines approved soon help worldwide supply.  True. reason company really annoys most. talking employ. Absolutely reddit comrade. Await votes. UK? idea. Fauci  side effects second dose end day bad. people handle sickness/pain better others. US covid cases dropping fast? 37 days, went averaging 260,000 cases 91,130 cases per day. say “during” “due to”. Peleton one companies IPO'd within past year lol Canada incredibly similar healthcare system vaccinating rate.

The reason UK successful powerhouse life sciences, genomic research pharmaceutical manufacturing. Actually US EU currently ban large vaccine exports hear Pfizer batches reaching developing countries (but also Canada, Japan, Korea, AUS, NZ...) rather small amounts time?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* current Government rational. change mind every week. It’s hard good relationship way. WOULD good keep wearing masks prevent flu.

Covid unique it’s contagious symptoms, wear masks whether sick not. flu, would wear mask sick, courtesy others. Like Japan. Lol, specifically comment time. see this. I'm seeing *Atlantic* articles ""Le NeW NorMaL""- I'm seeing articles pandemic ending. I'm seeingo states drop basically every restriction, states beginning reopenings *now* times*, Aus. dropped wildly enforced mask mandates ""recommended"", ads state health dept. vaccines indeed get us back ""normal"", etc. Beating pandem. going back fun things air. I'm seeing indication ""new"" normal (I cringe typing that) *default* position, much less popular one. Moderna, I’m 27M different, approved noish, regulating organization US. 

But main thing saying it’s shameful ridiculous issues obtaining something simple n95 mask US, still ongoing supply issue long. Well, commute used hour way zoning (Tesla drives time) LOVING getting 10 hours week back. let time finish MBA *and* time gym once. Different strokes man People? Who? would willing bet virologists medical professionals would recommend this, doesn’t mean anyone going requiring every flu season. 

“People” get you. know yet. enough evidence, yet. 
We'll wait see, best keep staying safe much possible case deadly; mean, worst case scenario practice safe masking social distancing behaviour variants turn deadly, nothing lost, right?  
I'm going erring side caution one; worth life, husband's life, want risky safety precautions. statement convinced me. Like, ""Don't buy masks work NEED them."" Ok, work hell need them? “Not conspiracy theorist”. 

Theorizes conspiracy... “Right United States, people walking around masks.”

He told public wear masks March. didn’t say don’t go buy them, explicitly told people wear them. countries best interest run masks world. cannot trust someone lies me. Well I’m MBA legit works internal corporate finance tell current companies revenues time high, client service suffered all, friends companies said workplaces going flexible forever remote working. think overestimate important office is, frankly, underestimating many companies realize many expenses trim downsizing offices. 

Thankfully don’t see offices going away entirely, collaboration / group creative process centered jobs certainly suffer without them. really love office setting I’m sure plenty ways get fill. No, isn’t. infected person represents millions chances mutate. infected human ""generation"" virus, steadily growing grumpier ""New virions block"" wouldnt know good music encoded genomes... failing notice stopped relevant months ago investigation lab done impartial third party far know. team Italy considering first case identified November 2019 now? US moved first cases December 2019? saying started kind important see first cases traveling. Perhaps one ended Southeast Asian country medical infrastructure even test SARS like viruses? Again, conspiracy evidence.

And please.. three ten investigators linked Chinese institutions. perhaps makes sense team familiar local institutions. Seven members links China whatsoever. really say recognizing Taiwan either un organization UN recognize Taiwan neither (all?) major countries. Indigenous woman Canada hanging little bags herbs doorknobs thwart covid...she fast tracked vaccine...pathetic. US UK paying much higher price per dose EU first refusal rights.

Please share sources information.

AstraZaneca selling cost, EU demand, came market lol one get? solid evidence Vitamin bio-available form administered Covid-19 patients significantly reduces hospitalization. Covid patients "" acute respiratory infection."" Treated individuals 2% hospitalization untreated 50% hospitalization. study still small (76 individuals, 50 treated) definitely enough data expand treatment study. Death democracy?

Give break. Democracy survived 2 world wars Spanish flu.

Suspending civil rights 3 months implementing quarantine travelers would killed democracy. fear mongering.

Quarantine jail. People repatriated Wuhan put quarantine facilities one questioning end democracy.

Giving government much control lives would lead abuse power. perfectly able roll back over. able roll back people died, health ruined left indebted. Damn Australia pissed got called war crimes Afghanistan, lol. know nothing ever “definitively proven” science. That’s kind whole point. live Indiana, we’ve face face since August. governor giving us priority vaccines. fomite transmission possibility.

Well... fuck. holy crap major hate boner china lolol.

why didnt question US shredding records front workers faces? read counted infections first dose, many positives likely infected vaccine time become effective. There's actually zero evidence yet possibilities, intermediate animal host like Pangolin. also conspiracy theory? first sentence ridiculous thing I've ever heard. That's absolutely science works. fact, I've personally spent thousands hours trying prove thing false, definitely allowed assume false. that's important.

And glossed it, I'll repeat. specifically said there's data, provided evidence suggest otherwise. moved goal-post wanting peer-reviewed data. ""because"" covid...it's simply bottom barrel men making conscious decision cowardly abuse woman. Yeah didn’t take account mom like that, absolutely get hears information people clearly got information unsourced Facebook post fuels concern takes quick Google search debunk information 1.6M doses day, take 8 months cover 75% population. amount doses day continues rise. Nobody wants forever, ton things weather gets nicer.

Check see decreasing deaths cases trend occurring now. Slightly misleading title!! 


Almost immediately article says variants **MAY** 70% deadlier. seem definitive proof this, yet.  get first shot 2 hours! actually work nature center, run school field trips, local school asked wanted jump them. also got call last week county saying could pick date. state absolutely terrible vaccinating, know multiple people working 100% remote hospitals vaccination.

That's vaccine rollout slow US one avail. limited facilities handle it, always ones prepared run large vaccination effort.

It’s “business” specifically, would nice see put money toward helping people, tbh almost definitely will.  read UK might surplus vaccines since purchased 300 million+ doses, bets coming back positive expected, likely going start sending extra countries. 

Good them. 

I hope countries (Canada, US) too. course, got really really good chance everything life going back less way was, roll little while. can't always get want. Exactly. 

I'm means ""COVID denier"" truther whatever wanna call them, feel like lot people (not all, lot) warped sense personal risk COVID. yeah, demographics determinative - even healthy babies died this, tragic - know much disease impacts time last year. always risk death COVID? Yeah, that's true existing general. people, even pre-existing conditions, die. even get ""long COVID"" which, IMO, also oversold (but that's another comment deserving downvotes lol).

Obviously I'm advocating germ-swapping free-for-all, feel like public health messaging around covid-19 really dropped ball explaining 0-50 year olds main concern limiting spread, contract they're rolling dice death. IDK. Small rant. put mask? last paragraph last comment lead conclusion? want merely acknowledge it’s harmful set guidelines lift it. 

I personally would want lifted now, need acknowledge they’ve made cost analysis. never said anything like I’ve seen. also generally propertionate increase cases. Indeed. no, allow AZ export vaccines, ban there. Right?

How many vaccines UK exported way?  defending Fauci specifically comments timeframe made pretty much every countries. 

In January every country Europe said need worry COVID. 

In February every country Europe said masks ineffective threat COVID low. mistake *every* country made (well except Asian countries wear masks sick anyway). mistake clear data wearing non-medical (i.e. non N95) face mask would help. data started show fact slow spread messaging changed. also certain level political pressure well due many countries enough face masks healthcare workers concerned would create shortage. 

In March every country Europe restrictions travel. least start March. shit got real though suddenly COVID big deal Europe lockdowns began. 

I can't answer regards New York American. 

The picture Fauci baseball game disingenuous though. asked throw first pitch two people sitting next people regularly around anyway. like crowd 50 strangers wear mask all. 

That's part problem new virus though. Everyone, even medical professionals, working blind. learn advice changes. sucks times thought correct changes night adjust changes that's is. 

While Fauci (and pretty much everyone else) got stuff wrong think history shows kind person want charge pandemic response. 

I feel attacks Fauci specifically strange unfair. guy 80 years old, given whole life public healthcare. could easily made hundred times current salary private industry wanted decades ago made name back 70s 80s stayed public healthcare. Yet people seem think money fame? Makes damn sense me. physically loving person, express love touch. get hug people frequently enough causes pain depression. 

Since March last year physical contact ***twice***. December 25th December 26th. 

I seen friends since March. seen coworkers since March. party, eat, played video games others since March. coworkers used play games work every single day. 

I'm one 3 4 people go \~200 person office getting see one two people day glass wall better one. month ago went sit couch use play games thought might help. sobbed 10 minutes. 

Around October November organizing things saw bottle bleach lingered little bit long.

Fuck ""lockdown affected them"" bullshit. 

I would vastly preferred one strict, short term lockdowns used countries basically eradicated COVID year long faux lockdown. 

I never wanted endless lockdown. wanted short one people actually followed. Gaslighting gone specific type abuse involving lying, anytime someone lies, weather report slightly off. People allowed express fucking miss SO. It’s “whining,” goddamn empathy. 

It absolutely heartbreaking spend nearly entire year unexpectedly away someone love. Yea, feel like inevitable SA strain become dominant Europe next months current dominant virus converge become like SA 
strain(what appears happening UK).

I honestly don’t understand people oblivious this. Feels like we’re literally time last year original outbreak. sub become full whiney antimask children Recommendations restrictions; they're advice. follow them. Well there's something say; looking annual flu curve, comparing COVID curve, makes seem course pandemic inevitable. Nevertheless that's case. likely curve could whole lot ""spikier"" without NPI. curve *didn't happen* Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan--the virus ""simply take course"" there; hardly took course all. 

Why not? would argue reason today, almost cases, 70% people AU still like borders closed. contrast, Alaska, daily incidence 22/100k, declared emergency removed travel restrictions, less 8% population fully vaccinated. 

So me, hard look Australia New Zealand, versus Alaska, judge individuals authorities great influence course contagion. I'm saying Aussie results even possible Americans, given behave, geography, saying personal responsibility obviously enters equation. Solar eclipses ""take course,"" pandemics take course people help set them. two states already dropping mask mandates? whole region US basically fully open months... I’m making argument happen moral standpoint promise many states shut matter what. They're going prominent used be, plenty them, constitute majority means. 

Unfortunately, online, outsized voice social media platforms. fucking weird encounter, tbh. mate, EU allows - there's executive order, there's ""hidden contract"".

Simply export bans Europe.

Canada getting vaccines Europe, USA literally glued lol

You need wake stop eating propaganda. say bad thing, maybe can't countries oh wait that's capitalism Well, that's exactly response I'd expect satirist. Source please “Gaslighting” devolved “internet strangers said something don’t agree makes angry!” anything happy told one conspiring happiness, people like feel persecuted guess. 

No one comments shit like ever actually truly gaslit, much horrifying experience lot people online think is. think average American able get vaccine? I’ve seen April thrown around. I’d basically one last groups eligible. types rules one reasons people largely stopped caring virus
Lucky Oceania don’t much cases anyway part? convalescent blood studies showing antibodies recoveries less effective SA mutation particular e484k mutation wild type, peoples even respond all. likely still see protection cells, data people obviously less protected e484k mutation UK one course hurt. end world. really really really good chance seeing again.

You feel sad, whine it. bad grand scheme things. What's point alive allowed actually ya know, live? makes think ending mask mandate today ignoring social wellbeing? vaccine shouldn’t option all. wasn’t even aware argument. really credible scientist backed it. 500,000 dead Americans can't wrong..... counting J&amp;J vaccine hold Variants? 

Still single dose vaccine eff. 70ish % game changer sure using goalposts? huge difference Antibodies waning vs Cell immunity. point study reveals natural immunity lasts long time. gofundme people want restrictions end, people act like want us wearing mask store lol problem media focuses efficacy preventing PCR-positive status. world suffer clinical diagnosis, extreme strain hospital system, massive excess deaths due severe disease. people educated different vaccines actually accomplishes, would far less skeptical towards J&amp;J AZ. Pay play I'm sure understand exactly saying.

The factory Marbourg almost certainly got EU money, company relying global supply chain. EU demanded output factory perhaps could restructured, perhaps could guaranteed output certain portion factory EU money earmarked for. didn't, would unreasonable change rules stage forcing company break existing contracts. evidence claim? Yeah Dr Fauci, Boris Johnson Scottish leaders talking Parliament, aren’t listening thesuppplugg? Come on. say save embarrassment. Tried sex wife covid. Kept going limp whenever 'over-exerting' myself. Yes, Pfizer good. bit shocked. 

I see bad even midsize company like Moderna: producing may 25% BioNTech/Pfizer. may get lot Trump. Yeah except it’s vaccine lmao CDC hasn’t set expectations end recommendation seemingly things. Like lifting quarantine requirements vaccinated. public wants hard objectives instead whim . 

And care social well-being now. might say, well still feel like masks important, considering that, haven’t even heard say something like . “no one”? Mental health talked constantly lockdowns. likely going happen. Pfizer really upping game. mostly going Pfizer Moderna. see z approved US all. Frankly think even mildly question whether J&amp;J although guess would 80% likely approved. case Novavax probably get approval get shipped countries. definitely going businesses ban masks least make take walk door facial recognition. downvoted ? fuck wrong sub? It’s gotten anti mask it’s insane I’m sure couples appreciate alive. still definitely hurts separated someone love long. 

You perspective still feel sadness situation. Ya that's guys asking for. awesome, reminds trying score concert tickets ticket Master. Empty platitude

Like Cuomo winning Emmy Obama winning nobel prize. read, nothing mentions trials Fauci disagrees article.  mean... people going second guess everything while. years we’ll back acting like barn animals 🤣 result eroded people’s trust health officials caused widespread confusion skepticism masks persists day?

Correlation causation. There's reason assume people skeptical masks anyway, since numerous myths spread. Scottish gov stated Parliament weeks ago... didn’t take time cite sources they’re kinda source... First off, moving goal post. discussing natural immunity.

Your ... huge amount people already contracted virus time without knowing and/or never got tested it.

Your Israeli study found robust immune response recovered COVID-19 patients vaccinated...

You're comparing apples apples. 
There plenty studies suggest immunity wanes time. [one even states: Post-infection Immunity: Data post-infection immunity limited suggests antibodies wane time. SARS-CoV-2 cellular immunity detected COVID-19 Reinfection:Data limited suggests reinfection unlikely within 3 months infection. fuck ever advocated endless lockdown?

Honestly sub dramatic conspiratorial. 

Sure disagreements get locked long, literally one advocating ""endless"". keep going seem like Fauci apologist know effective would be. asked explicit times wrong provided understanding trying save PPE healthcare workers want run masks general public. elaborated upfront importance masks prevent spread.

I told Trump worst man world trying keep public calm avoid mass panic. told transparency mattered.

Also, whole New York defense falls apart know would go see massive resurgence cases lied many people nursing homes. true handled correctly. 100% accurate.

It hard take narrative holidays drove major spike cases seriously even casual look state case curves. think making good strides advocating mental health awareness, name issue, lockdowns happened. one seems care. Cigarettes? /s nothing point making.  Nothing changed since December. distancing became issue first rounds vaccine given. 

Cincinnati, Cleveland, Akron. three large districts. doubts Columbus actually going back March 1st older kids. 

He’s even asking go back full time, hybrid, much easier social distance smaller classes. Useless article. many people reinfected considering ""reinfected?"" details here. It'll probably matter spend 1,750 GBP ""absolute joke"". mom got first shot yesterday. Seamless process Long Island. slight soreness arm outside - far good. 

I’m happy relieved she’ll vaccinated come mid March. you’re saying OnlyFans OnlyWay? ""pathetic"" microbiologists immunologists contact guy information. Thanks that! learned lot. Believe say ***REALLY*** want correct that; think that's going case though. Even J&amp;J ramps ahead schedule, looking closer June unless Moderna Pfizer exceed manufacturing plans, get approval larger vials, dead space needles find way clinics, etc. I'll go dance streets quite content wrong, think 100% doses full vaccination U.S. adults likely \~4-6 weeks that. 

If AstraZeneca gets approval soon, could eating proverbial hat, given dosing commitments U.S.. know what's going happen there; regulators thrilled them. Yes, also bit perspective. Life fair, sure appreciate have, even everything think have. important part 100% effective preventing severe cases deaths. vaccines AZ largely prevent severe illness think. Hopefully able get bunch soon South Africa needs anywhere. J&amp;J Novavax help Even prevent illness incredibly well. guess that’s, offense, probably educated topic I. wife educator entire department received rounds vaccine. amazing keeping face warm preventing dreaded lung-freeze

An epic side benefit I've found true last week... reads Reddit. qualifications needed? /s heard July 4th date people vaccinated go apeshit. gorge potato salad sack races whatever. NO! WEARING TWO MASKS! don’t know you’re downvoted simply saying hate restrictions. hate them, too. Hating doesn’t equal ignoring them.  N95 masks work...not farce. supply contract.

You've admitted wrong. realise that? No, I'm talking revised numbers available now. They're still better states. think issue much Israel supported Trump entirety stupidity. Hang i’ve defending science whole time Cuomo fan, envy governor federal government intentionally ignore COVID political move make specific governor look bad. build state-level CDC scratch two weeks recipe success.

Vote primary get better candidate in. Saturday 2700 deaths Saturday 2900. going drop single digits span week. Like cases going gradual decline two weeks now. still ways go least heading right direction. Also like overlooked yesterday despite fewest number deaths two half months know downvoted. IOC one corrupt international agencies world. NYC Cuomo governor mayor Well good thing it’s you. used extensively throughout US western nations effective is.

That’s reality, won’t change despite feelings. Sorry, care truth, preferred narrative. also didn’t say poisoned doses, said tainted doses. couldn’t remember wrote exactly, comment rightly deleted spreading misinformation. 

Why even imply Israel would ever consider something like that, there’s evidence indication effect? What’s point spreading misinformation inciting hate?

In event, don’t see point continuing argue you. dumb eyes read 8 million, thank  Interesting evolution. Fauci pro science - he’s stuck working Trump anti science - trump Israel huge supporters - fauci gets award Israel yet continues hypocrisy. yet get disappointed “homeland.” SA variant slightly different shape seems make antibodies immune system creates longer bind it. mean body protection, lower effectiveness protection. 


It's still early process studying it, far seems like vaccines strong enough response still good work variant.  Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine \*may\* lot problems it, even that's based one study pretty small narrow scope, give yet. 


But United States currently relying OxfordAZ vaccine, really matter New York.  point, appear SA variant going able gain foothold United States spread dangerously high levels vaccine could squash it. mostly talked facts make opinionated statements like ones made above. guess that's ""sweeping rug"". Here's link case eliminate WT UK version vaccine enough effectiveness SA variant going give evolutionary advantage SA variant dominant strain spreads. Hopefully Many states allowing essential workers, like OP, get vaccinated people nearly 60 like dad OP likely get vaccine dad can. Getting company fulfil contract easy bit. seem able negotiate decent contract anyone fulfil, forced otherwise. us americans long term memory wet newspaper will, say ""look, many people died all, overblown!"", they'll double herd immunity, mitigations forever strategy anything ever happens again. Especially places there's lot pressure anti-lockdown crowd there's good chance they'll sit back let next pandemic blow they're going let ""tricked"" killing economy something insignificant again. prices. need wear non-sealed mask top sealed one. Yea... covered nursing home Roughly third states policy. NY's nursing home deaths actually better per capita states. One thing better doesn’t make something else junk.

This highly effective vaccine far better many regards existing vaccines. I’ve spending lot time cooped lady totally understand happening.  opinion based on? people dedicate lives livelihoods researching diseases best fight them. experts, therefor allow experts dictate best help beat disease. random redditor sick preventative measures help lower death toll. vaccines US using effectiveness SA variant unlike AZ one. question enough eradicate it. think open one. Certainly 95% efficacy vs original type high enough eradicate US give enough people vaccine.

Interestingly UK implemented 14 day quarantine goverment approved hotel travelers coming countries impacted variants. wonder US same. Maybe, maybe get think vaccine got get effective. South Korea one countries long said well nvax. certainly trend starting look way especially countries consider moving away AZ. Lmao that’s funny EU said two factories producing AstraZeneca’s vaccine Britain supply EU contract company. **AstraZeneca said British government prevented exports vaccine** citing supply either dumb, playing dumb, lol Uuuuh UPS delivering package. mailman does.

Pls quit semantics. reply laughably moronic. claim I'm skeptical result eroded people’s trust health officials caused widespread confusion skepticism masks persists day

I already quoted twice, yet still think arguing something else. Oh see saying. read comment wrong first time. think page. 
But definitely seen people w/ school thought. interested see point view comes from.

You could use reasoning justify mask mandates Swine Flu. think endgame island avoid BS rest world.

They afford slow vaccinations really cases, although need soon. sensory issues still wear mask. Every take feeling makes gag, passes put back on. could probably expect hospitalizations deaths crater 3-5 weeks vulnerable 30% population given second dose. issue doses flux terms giving people two one, populations get it, on, can't really point specific date time. know expect general gradual improvement coming months. there's going one day wake over, rather start occupy less less resources long period time. right everything falling sort hard say attribute much trend vaccines much seasonal behavioral. number cases would expect last crater probably reach zero ever. much burden really wear masks

How much burden really get vaccinated going care vaccine use.

Oh... care. accept reality.

I initially ""disappointed"" country's option AZ, also understand beggars cant choosers. cost huge factor, think storage requirements really limits options.

So gimme AZ (hopefully... eventually... maybe?) maybe we'll get something better next year? Also, ""rich"" countries taking better options, less likely they'll spreading covid variants covered us (yes know still spread vaccinated even ""good"" options, bound still less so). infectious disease expert? not, would opinion keeping restrictions hold weight whatsoever? concern Moderna Pfizer vaccines.  submission linking yahoo.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Maybe party favors bikinis? Im always wondering thought process people treat wearing mask huge life-deterring inconvenience

Your breath feels tad warmer, huge bloody deal become dominant SA. become dominant elsewhere? Even doesn't, UK variant already mutating (Bristol variant) acquire mutations SA variant. People still denial, that's future dominant variant. think people worried get summer, deaths hospitalizations flu levels mask mandates still place ""it can't hurt."" Bring conspiracy theories. can't know much money making property taxes lol. funny everyone seems think landlords rich. Imagine downvoting someone prefers objectively better vaccines. Probably salty nerds jealous others received real vaccines, lmao. Fauci cited ""recent studies"" point anything particular. I'm ruling possibility time I'm seeing evidence claim. might meant causes deaths since people get it, based purely wording, looks like misleading statement.

I'm sure dozens interviews releases every day get mixed sometimes, would nice Twitter something could say ""In interview misspoke,"" ""In interview referring study,"" stuff like that. sure ethanol assumed now. bring pants burn? hate wear public!!! don’t need source lmao. barely test variants country, starting tbh. county already SA variant cases community transmission.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Infrastructure yes, vaccines think so. Even Germany (where Biontech is) can't get enough vaccines (yet). It’s number death, it’s effectiveness quarantine. ample evidence enforced quarantine significantly reduce death, reduce burden hospitals, improve economy. Basically one hand sacrifice weeks freedom save hundreds thousands lives, hand sacrifice hundreds thousands lives, mental health doctors nurses, economy ensure freedom, it’s pretty obvious one correct choice here. Almost nothing better nothing. EU getting pfizer vaccines investment well moderna shots received 950 million dollar grant US yet getting AZ vaccines anytime soon. Awesome. one getting wonder pay extra security needed defend empty-headed, loud-mouth morons threatening him. sounds.... biased.

I say surely still find number articles opinions sides -- like Brexit vote -- short term outlook proved right wrong. (Hint... claiming good idea proven wrong)

It's going well. So, obviously, ""Leave"" die-hards one place run right now, namely ""okay shit looks really bad I'm going stick guns, portray 'short term bad, long term good'.""

There's really reason think loss markets uk producers loss workers whose jobs britons can't want dois going magically get solved domestic demand domestic labor, 3 years 20. necessarily. pandemic. People's SOs die time, easily, last time would seen long fucking time ago. no, simple waiting period well. Death thoughts mortality loom us well. woven relationships much anyone else's. 

People can't allow others express feel pain embarrassingly emotionally infantile need grow fuck up. Everyone suffering pandemic way, fucking valid. Everyone allowed feel feel. correct, bad. looking death chart posted link. indeed seem plateauing. 100% correct cases fallen pretty steeply.

I've edited comment reflect error.

Regardless, still believe human behavior, less testing seasonality virus leading contributor decline cases.

I believe herd immunity, I'm damn sure vaccines, yet. Think may think, quickest certain subset population get back ""normal"" things like travel, going concerts etc safely. like certain vaccinations already required travel certain places. biosimilars generic drugs? guess QED.

I giving examples culture rapidly change. Nah, I'm going that. mask really interfere either things though? think able easily conclude initial comment making good faith criticism side effects lockdown policies. sure got downvoted speaking truth...some people sub act news positive here. can't post nothing hardly without either removed, conflicted flood downvotes both. reads like parody.  Could worse, could trapped 3rd world shit hole known US 🤣  And? it’s analogy poorly reasoned. can’t compare interracial marriage making someone indefinitely conceal nose mouth (it’s like mask wearing drawbacks cons).

Yeah, don’t follow argument all. It’s silly one. kind insulting, opinion, interracial gay couples make it. African Americans suffered due segregation. get vaccine probably able get scheduled. take July August distribute vaccines 50% people immunity natural infection vaccine, over. That's probably going happen mid April. Ok That's hot tourism lot cruises. likely gone even longer... course did. Would effective wear surgical mask (with adjustments made secure fit) underneath KN95? ask I’m start job Walmart considering fact I’m gonna inside around people day (luckily compliance fairly decent live, I’d say 90% people wear masks shop) I’d obviously want amount protection possible. 

The KN95s powecoms btw, read fit important order obtain maximum efficiency fit rather snug obviously don’t really ability proper testing ensure I’m getting everything can. problem temporary means different things different people - currently fact sits undefined eyes governing bodies leaves door open *mask covid spread 0, regardless takes years* *mask covid months - Nov Feb part forward moving policy*.

I think problem haven’t set clear *and realistic* goals endgame - take masks off, centred around hospital risk.

And thing, good chunk people think *shouldn’t* temporary. agree you! say “masks place hospitals would risk without remove masks soon hospitals longer risk”, agree. Suck months. look responses comment .. *but long term effects mild cases* ... *but vaccines aren’t perfect 1 20 might still catch covid* .... people don’t want masks temporary measures. number ok with? 

Hypothetically, lockdown quarantine disease would kill 10 people?

100? 

1000? 

20,000? 

50,000? 2300 people died Saturday nowhere near past this. depths pandemic another full calendar year. Yep, desk jobs maybe got work home. creative class got lament restrictions, everyone else mostly worked it.

Continuously giving guidance develops despite federal governments best efforts censor him? Wow, I’m happy could scream. exactly. Patents recognized, pharma companies allowed reverse engineer drug make replica original. can. India essentially recognizes patent end product, ingredients. generic druga made. country turned whackjob super quick least good one developed country/union allows vaccine exports engaged vaccine nationalism like UK US. FYI, paper think everyone wants vaccine able get one next 30 days? wish case way lol They're still dropping lot though, they're already dropped 2/3.

Only within week dropping July levels current rate. EU gets nothing AZ. almost nothing. Imagine calling vaccine 100% prevents death junk lol I'm UKphobe, politics, nothing UK people, UK govt. propaganda.

A lot people like frame reality export ban UK though, including UK govt states export ban, comment contract imposes ban.

All turn backs Europe show brexit best choice - win vaccine race.  Ravi Gupta, professor clinical microbiology University Cambridge, agreed surge testing new variant warranted, noting well E484K mutation another change “that likely helps escape antibodies”.

This good evidence school opening necessarily mean school abandoning precautions whatsoever people vaccinated. You’re delusional obviously?  got like 70% population first dose, dont fuck around. really would incredible homeless/transient populations US Using AZ doesn’t protect SA variant essentially selecting variant spread unopposed region. 

Not great idea. US 16% now. Many EU countries 2-3 weeks too.

I admire optimism, unfortunately impossible. There's way prove got work Walmart buying groceries.

If outstanding cluster cases employer markedly contemporary rates surrounding community, workplaces practices documentedly odds health authority recommendations (or even better, mandates) applicable time frame question, etc could rather easily meet ""preponderance evidence"" standard civil trial.

If vaccine turns could ppl stuck ICU minor fever golden. Mass distributing game changer would say makes president doesn’t equate paid worth. give us BioShock Big Daddy suits long put fun designs Maybe keep bottom sock drawer? that's lesson, learn, fools.

UK hires competent, experienced venture capitalist lead getting list vaccine candidates

they ensure watertight contract delivery terms, sign early,

the UK offers companies support development manufacturing, 

they agree pay premiums manufacturing stood up, cover companies liabilities. 

they recognise can't trust Merck linked US, pull AZ

Those lessons. isn't, zero sum game. failed this, lacked urgency, vision, strategy. logical conclusion given evidence. Nearly every country tried keep case numbers low failed (even ones done ""good"") bounce restrictions lockdowns causing stress population governments ultimetly illness deaths better economic results New Zealand had. would describe statement otherwise?
 Like 3.5m kiwis live outside Auckland life completly normal since April last year. Aucklanders additional 17 day level 3 lockdown one. Economically country done far better expected gone strength strength. That's claim. Someone else said that. Though actually qualify it. simply talk people ask trust Fauci masks. Here, I'll help. trust Fauci masks lied them. Instead, read actual scientific literature N95 masks. followed science. chose wear one argued it. anything else help with? think ruined argument. discussion going can't follow analogy. hope so. Way many people online I’m seeing seem philosophy “ONCE COVID NEVER WANT HEAR AGAIN!” Ya originated another small country nobody would cared state vaccinated them. Teachers included one first priority group.

They still say isn’t safe go back work unions backing it. It’s really ridiculous. Maybe us antimaskers antipantsers band together name freedom. pretty much see - J&amp;J Novavax approved end March one-two punch really end supply constraints we've facing - point matter logistics marketing coercion/incentivizing. it’s modesty issue, like pants hijab? showing face immodest? record work service industry well immigrated mandatory Hijab country. still host Olympics specifically meant article talking people South Africa reinfected S.A. variant. article provides little details headline. bribery paying thousands airline ticket endure life's little luxuries wear mask. think whole ""all together"" thing applies China. Yeah events describe literally involve cloaking, know, face. actually see things nothing other? It’s nonsensical discussion point. really inflammatory bring examples like in. mask helps reduce spread, eliminate it. still get infected masked people -- especially given people wearing inadequate masks. 

It going become global pandemic unless countries stopped travel also enforced coordinated, harsh lockdown measure. words, intents purposes, impossible. $40 so. mean NYS? He’s re-election 21 months. sure exact ruling. Friend outdoor wedding planned Memorial Day Weekend nervous given governor’s Newsom-esque ruling India keep themselves. case rate death rate high underreported ridiculous. Modi government terrible Covid19 response. Curious exactly ionized water considering know de-ionized water synonymous de-mineralized water, looked up.

This pseudoscience, beware. No. People sitting close proximity, filters cancel aerosols produced, eating drinking allowed.

In order safe, PCR tests would administered hours flight, days, airports would need nearly open-spaces, strict social distancing enforced, airplanes would nearly empty wide distancing passengers, air thoroughly filtered UV activated carbon ozone produces, cabin completely disenfected time.

I see airline wanting willingly, mandated local jurisdictions. fun troll! Ahaha! Oh, completely agree teachers near top list work home bottom list. point (I think) UT politicians give priority teachers ""be nice"" teachers' union held firm demands forced politicians' hands. teachers' unions same. Saw South African variant reportedly made way NY - although I’m sure already here.

My question - keep hearing it’s contagious vaccine may tough time fighting it, I’m yet find data vaccine affects severity. Like, vaccine cut severity deaths UK variant. studies SA Variant early. 

Tl;dr: reason afraid SA Variant relates vaccine, media painting headlines? orifice Ah yes must us dumb Americans would scared confused words. FOH Wow man understand UKPhobe that's everywhere commenting antiuk stuff, dude brit love UK gutted friendship tested difficult times. It’s junk compared real vaccines, lmao. It’s Great Value version mRNA shots. see good choice developing countries due storage shipping requirements, there’s reason settle J&amp;J US. many us waiting immigrate months Japan, hopefully helps quick reopening us. Source? live Germany missed info line I'm looking it. Moderna vial size increase FDA mulling help efficiency improvements Pfizer well, adding Novavax mix late March would make player since J&amp;J slower expected ramp. There's probably seasonal aspect numbers still way seen summer, we've got less cases summer we'll know we're heading right direction sure. burn them. make sure aren’t wearing it. Yes, right UK give advance warning. UK's agreement AZ gives UK first 100 million doses produced factories UK, funded UK govt.

Well I'm sorry either blind want came AstraZeneca Plc announced large delivery cuts EU, told EU officials could ship doses factories Britain obligations contract British government**, EU officials told Reuters said export ban place COVID-19 vaccines, repeatedly declined comment whether contract AstraZeneca prevents shipment doses literally there, hiding behind contract. warning, release contract, even comment it. you, many others, trying deny this? Like, it.

**They basically changed contract terms EU 8 weeks delivery**, UK govt. honesty clear it, look bad trying disguise export ban. wave high moral ground ""everyone must fair share"", sharing single fucking vaccine anyone they're done. **It's hypocrisy maximum.**

And say ""oh everyone expecting this""... ridiculous shameful. EU notified literally January, AZ itself.

and whole fuss export control ""trying torch peace"", load bullshit - trying diverge fact UK exporting single vaccine maintain moral high ground. Well can't both, thankfully that's noticed international community. **Be transparent.**

**Why make contracts public?** Right?

So yeah, good EU choke hold vaccine exports, tightly control on, enough argument based anger misinformation.

So far comments ones based misinformation brexit propaganda. Claiming everyone knew AZ contract UK (??!!) UK govt refuses comment it. blab 3 months delay, like EU responsibility make vaccines set orders (??!!).

Not acting like China imposing control private companies, UK govt. refuses comment contract tries save face international theater.

Disgusting. mean irrelevant, actually give crap virus interesting sub never relents complaining media, even reports fantastic news like this. mean reported countless times. I’ll honest, really depends California. SoCal? think you’d looking good - Bay Area definitely jointly marketing it, however IP still lies BioNTech, thats link says well. clearly see relevant patents exclusively owned BioNTech, allow pfizer use tech well market it, since BioNTech building factories Pfizer already.  it’s not. worst over. It’s seasonality, stupid. He's quintessentially right wing calls literally everyone else leftist. flu season peak around December? expect decline similarly transmitted virus start around well? 
And masking distancing practices effective all, expect seasonal decline pronounced otherwise would (since increasing decreasing transmission affect new cases linearly either direction). 
I kinda doubt countries reached quasi (social group based) herd immunity time. make sense based behavior varying one country next.

Edit: Getting information straight would nice though, yeah. hospital's fault vaccines. Dumb ass planning. hospitals fine like flu nobody care It’s big time fearmongering misinformation. Why?

Damn year in? Gaslighting. Sure. Whatever feeds victim complex! assumed lot someone never met comment, assumption 100% incorrect.

Welcome reddit. Walnut hills school going back 1 high school Cincinnati schools. staying closed space kids far enough apart. Since one school within district whole district still eligible vaccines. EU spent 3 months negotiating small discount vaccines currently politically imploding bit consequences this. going giving 1 million free vaccines right now. 

The Oxford Vaccine produced cost third world countries, $3 need transport -70C. program called Covax used distribute vaccines around world, paid 1st world countries. Masks minor inconvenience have. understand people arms them. probably best inconvenience:effectiveness ratio measures. 


You know major inconveniences? Shutting businesses. Shutting schools. seeing friends person since March. seeing grandmother since March. 


Those brutal. Wearing mask work 8 hours day? That's minor inconvenience. That's interesting. first thing comes mind mRNA tech. literally first kind, right? top tier gaslighting. Well done. millions across world vaccinated AstraZeneca. want it, sure medical professionals many countries would happily roll sleeve.  What's wrong that? pandemic relatively soon, still many people dying day.

Just things improving mean assume variants nothing. 

Neither headline article suggests restrictions continue years. Yet another useless druggie replying comments, even surprised next rounds elections restricted states, I'll bet. exceptions, think lot governors overly restrictive face competitive races. true change anytime new variants honestly everyone rushing think guy difficulty wearing mask regularly probably issues adjusting new situations me. like I'm trying advocate wearing masks forever cut disease transmission. adult claiming hardship wearing mask daily activities bit....you know?

Let's say unadaptable avoid getting trouble. Yes. let's forget landlords create NOTHING. simply live sweat, blood, tears Hardwork tenants mercy society creates artificial shortages housing. create economic value, constrain it. Basically, profit structural flaw way economy manages supply housing.  Novavax absolutely needed. Even small country like Norway, delivery EU 10 million mean enough doses fully vaccinate medium size city. supply severely limited, take everything get, especially good vaccine. don’t think they’re rush given like... cases next deaths now, western countries race time get things control. act like US thesame thing IMF should! solely made executed private sector. medical discoveries are. example Moderna got assistance lot public organizations, mention, tax money.

Who think funds NIH, BARDA, NIAID? Seniors living nursing homes/congregate care settings vaccinated teachers. seniors living community bumped favor teachers, week. agree. Give everyone (i.e. 16+, possibly 12+ trials finish soon) chance get vaccine, become effective (i.e. date supply outpaces demand + 6 weeks). see reason keep restrictions. anyone wants additional information vaccines Mexico, link updated calendar vaccine arrivals 870,000 doses Serum Institute India arrive Feb, schedule, expecting 1'600,00 doses March. suppliers differnet timelines. AZ-Oxford vaccines intended population 60.

The propposed calendar government expected give vaccines medical personnel directly Covid areas December February... medical personnel getting Pfizer deliveries stopped January know due Pfizer reconfiguration hope medical personnel vaccinated end February, Pfizer deliveries resume today. 

The vaccination plan published December scheduled people 60 February - April... rollout rest us go slowly way June 2022 :( Hopefully plan yesterday roughly 700k doses Pfizer vaccine administered. lot medical personnel still waiting second doses.

Lastly bit estimates:

Population: 126 million

Covid medical personnel: 250,000

All medical personnel: 3'100,000

Population 60: 30 million

Disclaimer: Links Spanish medical field, hunkering 65 parents, decided stay optimist patient April doses administered, overall vaccination schemes Mexico relatively successful. try stay updated Covid hard. many vaccines UK exported? allow Astrazeneca, private company, export vaccines EU?

Right.

Just like USA export excutive order forbids companies sells vaccines outside USA - export ban, presidential request right?

Why trying hard make look like anything else export ban?

Can private company move stock outside company? No. That's export ban, hide behind many things. Hell China pro shit.

China censor internet, firewall prevents attacks malwares keep citizens safe, right?

UK export bans, allow company export vaccines country due contract obligations refuse comment share information about, right? become divisive think? lot “news” political commentary public health issue seems source it. lot people one side politics seem echo messaging. Fear anger sell ads get clicks, fear anger based imaginary things bogeymen. happened “standard” strain well, it’s good news it’s far unheard happening. anyone know one dose Moderna Pfizer 
helps reduce potential severe covid cases/deaths/hospitalizations? know one shot provides sort immunity ranging 50-80% haven’t found info relating severe cases one shot. Honest question I’m trying snarky.. teachers get vaccinated older people? 30 year old teacher get 65 year old? thought entire goal ease burden hospitals.. wouldn’t vaccinating old people that? think problem dealing pandemic year much seems ever change . know people received vaccinations that's great whole virus situation seems go forever . nightmare end . ridiculous. give second shot 12 weeks many cases honestly minor inconvenience effective pandemic (besides maybe washing hands often, people anyway). So, minor, relatively speaking. Would rather full lockdown? agree research towards RNA treatments correlates ease setting manufacturing facilities, there's guarantee current manufacturing capacity correlates RNA therapy research. simply pointing using number attenuated vaccines country makes predict number RNA vaccines country make like using current production gas cars predict production EVs. definitely correlate bit, also considerable amount variation.

The US UK exported contracts manufacturers receive first \[number\] doses. UK explicit ban exports US implemented one able combat theft theft illegal selling vaccines people outside vaccination framework criminal charges well civil suits. EU negotiated sooner better forced let companies export doses. fully agree said. extremely fucking depressing, even dehumanizing. Northern Italy high 40 low 50s last March. NYC 40’s low 50s throughout March. 

The virus highly seasonal since immunity population still spread climate. spreads super efficiently cold weather. people’s immune systems aren’t good winter months. it’s double whammy. curiosity sake scrolled Eric Feigl-Ding's twitter feed holy hell non-stop barrage stuff aimed elevating stress highest amount possible. think we're worst possible position I'd hard pressed see light end tunnel bubble voices like predominant one. Nope, asked. wait list ""not wasting vaccine"" red area state. Neither qualifies (both 40, works automotive works local theater), got doses going expire find arm place many willing arms.

Crazy situation occur. blatantly obvious correct. pattern many states now. that’s vaccines work. 

Each vaccine efficacy, means even people vaccinated infected.

Enough people need vaccinated achieve herd immunity.

No one cares don’t want share vaccination history, don’t surprised consequences don’t! one people think tax rich more? Otherwise there's much point debating course is. That's kitchen freezer costs hundred bucks, instead hundred millions. mean stopped coming months gets annoying called “anti-science” traitor, murderer, bio-terrorist, etc wanting social life job back. What’s funny sharing pre 2020 pandemic plans someone called nerd said stop looking scientific documents???????????? Anti science much science guess. toned down, ok coming back people disagree, aren’t prone hyperbole. course not. I'm talking plan vaccinate rapidly using highest quality vaccines avoiding vaccines like AstraZeneca going stop pandemic [Well done interview Jake Tapper CDC director opening actually is. would hate lot less people governments damn insufferable them.

I can't go social media sites without people fussing others wearing them.

I can't go anywhere without seeing least 10 signs telling wear one. 

I can't even use reddit without getting cdc ads telling wear them.

It's year now, fucking get it. can't even remember last time I've seen someone public indoors without one. 

I'm glad wear often. really feel bad service people forced wear 8 hours day!

Also, we're subject people wearing better masks protect instead whining others wearing mask? understand initially reserved healthcare workers, plentiful now? use KN95's since found online low price, know N95 ones way better, figure better fashionable designer cloth masks people like. Lol WTF talking about...so plan let people die immunity achieved? Idk you’re getting attacked, you’re right. tell people losses, shocked. literally don’t know anyone sick, let alone died. 

We absolutely keep telling people see what’s happening real impactful. Enough little wakeup calls might even change reckless behaviors Nah cause they're looking most. funny joke said pretty right. certain pretty damn likely bought disposable surgical masks. Washable sounds great, kids, despite added cost, easier less cumbersome. wear disposables myself. fold couple extra put zlploc backpack pocket case lose break theirs. I’m personally fine wearing mask next couple months honestly feel like mid summer cases spread definitely dropping, along fact CURRENTLY vaccinating 2 million people per day 2 dose regimen, good. 

Along harsh reality lot people still need find work economy needs get better countries need learn lesson Australia learned 100 years ago. first world war cut Australia's supply polio vaccines Australian government set Commonwealth Serum Laboratories produce it. organisation currently producing vaccine Australians.

And Australia government investing 800 million dollary doos build new facility produce vaccines well newer vaccine types like Pfizer vaccine. Planning next time happens already begun. Pfizer effective covid ""a step toward opposite"" good news, happens prove complete sterilization nigh impossible. exer expected anything different... *Most* vaccines sterilizing.

But that's enough me. trying understand. two getting economy back normal US back normal well New Zealand Australia

That's certain yet. We'll see. OK Hun? Agreed. don’t need demand mask restrictions lifted right second. it’s conversation needs likely soon. huge contingent “new normal”, make sure really temporary, soon need force pressure get rid them, long remain trajectory course. 

Masks shouldn’t political, soon, really political two sides debate politics masks forever masks forever. doubt it. honor EU deals they're going punish egregious breaches? Might well sell country southern hemisphere desperate doses then. demonstrate point false. going cost hundred million dollars whole country

And going manufacture equipment? suspect -70 freezer quite different manufacturing kitchen freezer. here. regret taking painkillers too. knew could've held read hand.

I'm getting second dose hours. Hopefully turn bad second dose. I'm originally Illinois think colored opinion bit lol. Thank pointing out. Fauci completely untrustworthy. done time time even admitted sometimes things tells public manipulate give straight truth.

Fauci prone [elite like anyone else held position power long enough forget normal people easily frightened rubes. think lies, think manufactures certain flavor consent assumption skittish frightened appreciate truth. anyone dates Pfizer Moderna vaccines set go full FDA approval? read somewhere April Pfizer would apply...but nothing Moderna. Also, it’s shown 100% certain vaccines stop transmission can’t really try take moral high ground claiming “vaccines required protect society whole”. right now, vaccines conclusively shown protect vaccinated person. sound like going hard time adjusting will. Carry on. Quiet. PA saw &lt;2k cases... Weather: explain California Florida cases dropping, mention Southern Hemisphere? Less testing: may case positivity rate dramatically place. Seasonality: could explain US, Southern Hemisphere? Dumb luck would equate huge amount people already contracted virus time without knowing and/or never got tested it.  Please send info then. would appreciate it. Ad hominem attacks also work great scientific argument. given reason believe anything say attack personal character.

This article 2 days ago sub title literally says Tcells 'could' help. Australia never going open then? Good thing actually like staying hostels Australians borderline alcoholics snore like wouldn’t believe.   What's alarming people seem totally content well. Like how?!

I live thousand miles family lot friends, good least see talk even half hour so. Sorry that's alarming you! Works me. I'd call anyone giving shit. Even particularly want share approach myself, believe let people express freely (within reason), certainly accepted. He’s done exactly opposite. People think science kind group consensus hive brain reality rarely is. acts like answers objective, absolute reality it’s one guy’s interpretation best approach based personal biases, studies likes, political reality, etc. frankly I’ve never seen admit wrong, he’s wrong plenty times. like wearing mask?

Why matter all? planning harass people continue wear masks? post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* people's faces care see close friends family. Even then, they're still despite wearing mask. know changes things. really topic, but, sure, you, too. make sure follow whatever mandates set government. want fodder r/publicfreakout. There's enough is. relatively safe compared maskless restaurant still far far absolutely safe like imma keep let millions die

c19 lethal enough million people die US.

0.3% IFR * 330 million people 990,000. million. article's pretty bare. video contains actual details. Oh, they'd much rather make Pfizer they're probably equipped so. Never mind IP issues. bright side probably quite many elderly vaccinate get around it. saw study last night looking Pfizer vaccine South Africa strain. Probably 40 50% people reinfected based get much milder based extrapolation percentage people lost neutralizing antibodies. I'll link later find Still waiting Thanksgiving surge. wanted make post whoever sees nervous Moderna vaccine side-effects:

I'm healthy 25 yr old. fever one day topped 102.3. Unpleasant? Sure. nothing able handle. Please get ur vaccines I’m glad kid came coma. I’m jealous too. wish I’d coma last 10 months..... They're working Xprescheck, part Xspa Group. ""The centers far available Newark, San Francisco LAX airports, plans expand."" Xprescheck already testing areas multiple airports made deal United testing sites hubs. We're looking new normal travel kind 9/11 changed security airports forever. That's want. care people long give grief wearing one. Lol comparison also makes logical sense. dumb. He's already highest-paid federal employee US. Plus, he's wrong every stage pandemic. bending backwards took ibuprofen 12 hours getting vaccinated. woke around 4am chills, joint pain, stabbing headache. article called symptoms “uncomfortable” something expected wait out. However, made feel miserable. first dose. Apparently second dose hits stronger I’m sure expect. hope taking ibuprofen didn’t affect immunity vaccine. articles say one thing others say another thing, it’s making regret taking ibuprofen all. two parts this... number one managing cases course fantastic job with. Number two getting economy back normal US back normal well New Zealand Australia comment supposed meaningful fashion?

Even digital world, video chat often used includes body language faces. Yes point Australia pretty far behind Trump's executive order binding, symbolic effort ""America First.""

The amount cognitive dissonance that's going there... brexit folks say ""contractual obligation""!

Fucking it, many vaccines exported UK USA? 0.

It's vaccine nationalism full glory, export bans slapped on. I’m anti vaxx. I’m pro choice. foreign substance. created lab? It’s like bodily substance like blood. It’s something found nature like dirt, plants etc. really sure words “foreign substance” offended that’s truly is.

Even medications foreign substances, aren’t injected directly bloodstream.

I don’t think compare getting drivers license vaccine passport. recently coworker ask could receive list unvaccinated coworkers. Doesn’t everyone see crazy getting? Might well hand medical records everyone meet direction going on.

I’ll getting vaccinated don’t want share health information everyone everywhere go. Also, vaccines work, don’t know vaccinated people butt hurt unvaccinated people. Southern Hemisphere though? Cases dropping too. think regular person, making mountain molehill. like entire faces blocked, bottom half. modern day communication even involve seeing person's face (e.g. texting, calls, emails, etc.)

How old you, roughly? senior? Generational differences might explain greater need facial cues...? going zero work. 

It worked quite well them, still waiting vaccine... reasonable point. that's reason, one right call opponents policies ""whiners."" hope mandates ignored. could originated Italy carried China factory workers? That’s seems unlikely given little factory workers tend travel. also haven’t seen evidence showing Covid-19 Italy December. it’s significant, go well carry similar studies there? Daily weekly. media literally writes variants economy Good point vaccinated vaccinated transmission. saw another article showed Pfizer 80% effective Israel different analysis. saying series compelling points previous federal government sending without tracking. current one trying to. Literally, country new management. 

And everywhere way demand vaccine. demand getting vaccine actually needed most. High risk groups communities currently left behind areas. Low income Americans getting vaccine, seems mostly issues access. actually getting vaccinated matters. don’t like stats used expressly prove authors thesis,  narrative Xi wants. many days hours listen pandemic coverage. ""New strains found..."" ""So state leads number vaccinated..."" think waiting global crisis pass bit ridiculous. vaccinations continue planned, United States going quickly approach point less people dying virus seasonal flu. upsetting end entire world once, realistic expect developed world research manufacture vaccine prioritize billions people live do.

Would really worth isolate every country, mask everyone up, eradicate remaining middle class businesses, destroy mental health entire generations death counts we've seen every year since anyone reading born? Ahem. Honestly, getting flu sucks. I'd okay 3 months mask wearing every winter stop spread flu. minor inconvenience. happen society. hope mask wearing covid break get vaccinated. suspect people jump gun. done long time ago. 

Just imagine alien civ watching top scientist create life saving vaccine virus killing humans millions underproduce owners patent making money. mean agree sentiment comment (failure labor rights) , disagree implication choice teachers got make. lot teachers work states striking grounds lose teaching license, can't afford work/lose job, they've stuck rock hard place since September. thing that's even close concerning person talking false negatives. anything falling hospitalization rates. Everyone else blatantly grasping straws. Except did, USA waved liability away God knows UK (everything points direction).

The vaccines got exception liability ones sold cost - like AZ vaccine.

There article financial times expanding taking long time. get point fully vaccinated actively decided so, face condoms must go completely.

I'm really curious people getting idea goal.

Can point something seen says otherwise? I'm completely baffled many comments like seem think there's secret society who's planning make us wear mask forever.  Dude I'll honest beg differ. IMHO, Dr. Fauci talking a$$ talks threshold ""herd immunity"". speculation best. doubt takes account things like population density etc play significant role. 30%, vaccines already positives already there. 70% like Dr. Fauci says could summer. I’m comparing United States. less cases total Tennessee. 3 million people. 

And that’s one country. Compare 30 others worse statistics them. France. Italy. USA. UK. Yeah, I'm Hawaii I'm used numbers like 75%-90% complete lunch time. Well, lunch time coming ...35k? wtf? stop talking religion it’s science. Yeah, would separate suit landlord, case going fly 1st class 90% time. Yeah, Ill still wear mask. Considering thread Mexico getting vaccines India, seems one stretching tell usual untruths UK EU. Appears lack self-awareness well honesty. one assuming away shit, guy. thoughts incredibly problematic reason nothing changed. accepting things way furthering problem.

Anyway. I'm gonna continue conversation someone happy complacency mediocrity. That’s we’re talking about. forced readmission alone issue.

Of course, PCR testing contagiousness tenuously related, fact states ordered nursing homes accept COVID positive patients.

Since NY leader collaboration, states NY did, I’m going use “modeled” shorthand. believe therapies approved home use. 

Rest, good diet fluids seen recommended. Wow that’s awesome. Well deserved. [herd immunity Dr. Fauci acknowledged slowly deliberately moving goal posts. so, said, partly based new science, partly gut feeling country finally ready hear really thinks.

His intentions likely good, point says interpreted attempt influence popular opinion rather necessarily truth. conspiracy garbage coming this. sir.  Also use cash declining long pandemic. Thats exactly nostradamus level take. think masks symbol life normal lot people. agree it’s really big deal wear mask, day mask wearing becomes unnecessary probably provide symbolic “end” pandemic lot people. AstraZenica inform EU threw hissy fit.

AstraZeneca gave best-case projections EU end able meet. promise anything.

AstraZeneca exported vaccines UK, UK astrazeneca vaccines produced UK.

The UK invested Biontech too, EU company mean belongs EU. feeling Japan either going completely eradicate disease everyone else totally fail properly distribute vaccine nothing between. EU could that. Nations states much powerful companies laughable.

Europe: ""\*OUR\* Vaccines"" can’t speak state state differences many places rent considered irrespective landlord responsibility, basic living conditions aren’t met it’s tenant access legal recourse landlord they’re expected still pay rent many freedom dollars? Well ground fucking insane, school 3 staff cases last week, 5 month... come back 7 days without negative test symptom free.

We distance learning 20%. staggered days whole school mixes time, fucking time bomb. mention expected even pregnant pregnant partner.

Masks optional permission needed staff wear I'm one so. lot international staff aware like elsewhere. since suffer rosacea masks trigger something fierce. men like myself, rosacea left fester permanently disfigure face. 

So yeah, downplaying severity outbreak get things control. currently testing requirements domestic travel (except HI), international trips. Testing prior domestic flight would purely voluntary.  people questioning start. called scientists. shown many times mask useful.  


&amp;#x200B;

Yes, antimask administration removed tests suggested double masking beneficial.  may know strains contagious.  mandated double mask, science suggesting great way help end pandemic.  


 
If everyone double masked would wear masks much sooner.  even ffp2/kn95 masks That’s think he’s talking double masking. Maybe it’ll get people wear one logic. think “when people think you’re overreacting, that’s know...” line thinking pretty faulty. Better safe sorry doesn’t easily translate public policy. 🌯 people say want lift mandates completely unreasonable standard met. Times strains? forgotten world war 2? naive definitely true European think uk enemy here, build bridges friend demolish them, hope late fob hatrad temporary. fact thousands people dying america every day? dont think families normal year. Going zero worked great. required readmission hospital patients whose symptoms improved. patients longer contageous nursing homes reluctant take back continued test positive - happens well someone stops contageous. think 250,000 cases &lt;100,000 cases day dip. makes think worst yet come? Neither virus! Canadian here. wonder government use situation gain influence world stage line “soft power” diplomacy. Soon shithole change flight free later date (and different destination, like). I’m US right now. Everything fully functional things pretty much like 2019 except masks limited closures public events. definitely wouldn’t want trapped Australia right now. Interesting analysis, XUANKUN It’s true. know thought early severity reinfection huge question/concern things like Dengue first time around vast majority people fine next season get infected different variant/strain (I believe like 4 5 circulation) much higher chance getting ass handed it.  

Not getting vaccinated dengue place it’s ubiquitous pretty foolish strange pathology.  

Thank God Covid doesn’t seem same. Australia New Zealand position - it’s morally right jump front queue countries someone dying Covid-19 every minute last Covid death months ago. endgame vaccination take time assess safety compared countries. dIsgUsteD coUntRy Good Fauci.  Wow media really convinced general population variants problem. Disgraceful Hahahaha mandating masks outside pandemic?

Well fuck life,I thought couldn’t get worse here.
I’ve given notice work,I think I’m going stay next 3 months . want actual answer, people like told do. essentially central aspect American culture. I'm sure could argue that's stupid people stupid everyone stupid, that's answer.

Most people like wear masks. rules say wear masks, evidence suggests that's good idea due extreme conditions pandemic. psychologically, effect someone telling something want without immediately apparent public benefit. People going want resist stupid pretend going happen.

Moves like practically inevitable. People want they're told, they'll pay that's somehow better. get say authorities told to, adds sense power resistance, even arguably make much sense. Nope, 5 specifically required decent proxy Ohio interpretatio CDC policy _recommended_ acceptance SNF could deal COVID patients safely,

The difference “requires” “recommends” crux. Compare Sweden neighbor Norway. Two countries strong cultural economic ties, previously country, radically different approaches Covid.

Sweden: 122.04 deaths per 100k

Norway: 11.14 deaths per 100k. Hopefully LAPD JOB time arrest nutjobs try disrupting rollout choose assume away complicated difficult problems pretending individual citizen ""uphold government higher standards"", particularly area billions dollars spent shortage ink spilled people trying figure government consistently failed. believe J&amp;J vaccine favoured SA additional trials ongoing confirm efficacy dominant strain country, may necessarily precise variant cause present panic.
That said, infection fatality rates SA falling 5 consecutive weeks *without* vaccine, driven primarily public health measures. media hysteria SA variant unsupported data. make good points, inability acknowledge indisputable, scientifically-proven benefit mask wearing makes whole argument moot. they're mild asymptomatic. Seems like clear win vaccination. much Israel, right-wing government Israel. many countries. Right-wing governments tended support him, mean whole country wholeheartedly supported him. I'm mask mandates (outside active pandemic). whatever want everyone opportunityto get vaccinated. I'm going burn masks throw massive party soon possibly can. go? Seems like widespread impossible figure infection came from, always problem (proof disease contracted), pandemic. Well times strain saw allies are: basically UK forcing AZ bring vaccines India Europe (which doubt effect), would guessed EU would turn Russia help.

New deals partnerships come this: basically USA UK taking care themselves, EU, China, Russia, India serving exporting globally. 

Let's see go forward, thankfully EU doubling mRNA, imo revoke AZ contract. able accept award, that’s you’re worried about. I'm sure comfort half milion dead people US die black death. concerned future children advocating teachers get vaccinated. throwing classroom dozen kids saying ""good luck dying"" really cut it. Please help cannot find sources. wife home COVID, insurance, match criteria interventions (e.g. BAM). find information home therapies help headache, body ache AND/OR prescriptions request doctor called office helpful ALL! link type discussion appreciated. Sorry broke rule searched luck. Peace thank you! mean, virus still exist 10 years, too. Probably 100 years well, although say definitely one. 

That nothing whether not. That's rough. probably US known Pfizer vaccine anything else would scare confuse people.

So let's fully shadow entire company behind vaccine people expected dumb, *duh* think secret kind conspiracy, recent comments public officials least mildly concerning me.

Last Thursday, Biden suggested something effective wearing masks course next year could save countless lives. Even current pace, everyone US developed world ample time get fully vaccinated desire way sooner year clue masks would reasonably necessary another year.

Fauci also mentioned last week public would need wear masks ""several, several months."" Granted, non-specific, me, implies potential mask mandates place perhaps another year well.

All all, particularly encouraging commentary far I'm concerned. feel guilty. get shots get way. SLPs, psychologists, guidance counselors listed health care professionals good reason. serious consequences diagnosing treating disorders like autism timely manner Australia producing AZ home. Facts self-aware? there's lots circumstantial evidence. Things like:

* novel coronavirus popped right next lab researching coronaviruses
* lab history leaks
* SARS-CoV-2 basically looks like two coronaviruses known WIV smooshed together
* ...in way closely matches smoosh together coronaviruses lab
* viruses appear wild far away Wuhan Florida New York, yet Wuhan's broke out
* multitude ways - refusing investigators year, refusing investigators access early patient data, locking WIV's research soon virus appeared, censoring researchers suggesting lab leak hypothesis, etc. - China appears behaving though something hide
* Despite actively pursuing zoonotic hypothesis, we've still completely failed provide evidence substantiate we've able viruses past
* SARS-CoV-2 appeared intensely suited human carriers immediately upon discovery, instead rapidly adapting new host SARS-CoV-1 (which casts doubt zoonotic hypothesis suggests pre-leak gain-of-function work)

This amount *Smoking Gun* evidence anything like that; convict WIV court law, speak. certainly *evidence*, enough evidence think dismissing hand means probably reflect *yourself*. Pretty sure media focuses efficacy preventing symptomatic COVID. That's number always see, positive PCR test. meant defray liability employers. employers taking actions make COVID virtual certainty job (they are), appropriate solution increase employers premiums, deny claims. 

Unless codified law guidance insurance companies cannot unilaterally increase premiums based subjective measures. class people forced go work didn’t go hungry. want talk practicalities let’s recognize people families already backed corner desperate.

The EU could that. Nations states much powerful companies laughable. 

The EU chooses long companys mostly keep contractual obligations EU. commission subtle introduction export controls response AZs shortfall, AZs magically found additional 8 million doses go towards fullfilling EU contracts. really hope vaccines enough stop this, I’m really looking forward future thrown back lockdown every couple months.

Would kindly remind class exactly narrative i'm pushing that's reinforce zero information? i've done thread make statement conspiracy exists, they've put literally everywhere unnecessarily victimizing yourself.

Yes, UK part EU weeks ago. Uh, UK building plants capacity make vaccines? never happened? page exactly 23rd May 2020 way COVID vaccines even production.

Ah trying say global vaccine production shifted completely balance global vaccine manufacturing Europe longer powerhouse - previous 1.7 billion vaccines produced annually stopped existing, right?

I shared source European Federation Pharmaceutical Industries Associations (EFPIA), information contradicting - stop lazy - go fetch something. minks cats dogs? never said people took precautions didn’t get it? 

But bet higher percentage didn’t take precautions got take precautions. Yeah that's great US, poorer countries going care vaccine use.

Pfizer send doses abroad fulfill contract US government. doses exported EU also contractually bound point. US Western countries selfish bought 3x vaccine needed poor countries till 2022.

It's nothing new. want profit rather helping others. Weather: explain California Florida cases dropping.

[Florida dropped could due natural seasonality. anything, looks like Florida plateauing. California pretty rough covid season. seeing decline peak possibly due seasonality Dumb luck would equate huge amount people already contracted virus time without knowing and/or never got tested it

Even case, immunity appears wane time. people remain immune forever. addition, variants one South Africa shown escape natural immunity. Dumb luck something banking on. mom teacher 63 (just shy vaccine requirement) underlying health issues. want go back terrified losing job. 

I support young healthy teachers feel ready, want punish people want cautious. 

I support states vaccinating teachers early possible. points one three disagree ""for without eagle eyes"" Even countries switch novavax eat cost AZ, would still cheaper purchased MRNA vaccines. Ah yes, scream WRONG SCIENCE opponent gives up, win. worked last year, double down?  Thanks, good know. suspect second-best vaccine would save lot lives best vaccine later. UK’s working good pace vaccinations, Bahamas’ membership Commonwealth might bump list get access UK’s excess vaccines

Basically, hopefully UK give guys ruled Immortal Majesty Queen Elizabeth II really going cough sneeze mask put back face? think depends . GA county reopened late August tons outbreaks, forcing different schools go back hybrid schedules on, lots old teacher friends gotten it, and/or spend personal ""sick"" days quarantining school exposure. 

Our county 10% infection rate moment. daughters elementary school SIX teachers quit around time wondered going on. went pick daughters monthly supplies (thankfully virtual open students, took year) playground looked entire grade level kids (around 80-90ish) playing eachother masks, three teachers standing right next eachother, maskless, chatting another teacher sat across way mask on. shocked allowed school day, know started strict mask protocols, even recess. assume lost staff apparently loosening mask rules. felt bad one masked teacher hope doesnt get sick forced around atmosphere. So, sadly, think probably fine people actually follow rules. country (Germany) told choose vaccine want, 1-3 months. herd immunity less 30% one arguing poorer countries get first all. Anywhere. even article. argument simply need assistance get citizens residents eventually help given. Teachers completely ignored vaccine U.K. PM infinite wisdom wanting schools open entirely 8 March much relaxed last summer cases much lower... think lines vaccines 4 months? Yup, safe free trade, predictable movements goods, services peoples. Enforcement things, etc. literally back-bone global 'free trade'. think something like 300+ overseas active military bases? 600? never remember. Basically took hundred former British French bases WWII operated protect trade hundreds years. lifestyles major advancements living standards allies last 80 years still today many ways feasible unified force backing 'free trade'. If/when USA starts close bases global trade longer protected single dominant player MAJOR changes world economy. that's whole 'nother discussion :-) Comment dumber'n sack yams! Wow well great thanks input Fauci 🙄 Yes, Maharashtra. happen 45 days? Well, technically, ""infections"", ""cases"". case test positive specific symptoms.

But agree point -- think virus far prevalent previously reported, see [my above.

One upshots means illness fatality rate far lower thought. 10 times many infections, fatality rate 10 times lower.

This exactly happened Swine Flu, fatality rate originally estimated 3-5% later revised something like 0.01% realized 20% population exposed. Covid far contagious makes sense many people infected. automatically put year isolation ruining kid's life kid losing parent says lot. Ranch good french fries. Israel already free get. Well, next time, better criticize article male scientist. /s commuted via mass transit. solid 2 hours day could zone worry much anything. That's taken away me., think underestimate important office is. defines job culture, lets actually form relationships coworkers bosses. lot easier fire someone actually seen year someone know talk everyday.

Commutes suck, traffic sucks, offices reason hope never give mine up. That's another great example. highly recommend reading Wikipedia him. chat log leaked online hospital bulletin novel virus. Importantly, source information hospital releasing hospitals region information. I.e coverup. wanted cover even sent bulletin. could easily let spread world without word. got trouble information released general public online eventually cleared wrong doing. mention informed day leak, days noticed outbreak. could argue told otherwise that's assumption supported fact sent bulletin first place. Oh see I'm seeing KN95 worse? hundreds viruses infecting humans, mutating. virus longer novel people's immune systems threat flu strains circulating globe. still kills people??! could something it, would prove lockdowns extremely effective reducing community spread. vaccinated would’ve right lol. Conversely, knowing risking health eat different roof pretty sad (both people come contact with), nothing say change minds won’t try. hope don’t cross paths bit reports effect since months pandemic. US states antibody testing found 4-5x many positive results reported cases. statistical measures estimated anywhere 5 20 times many people infected reported. One report early said 80x.

[Study shows 10 times New Yorkers Covid-19 April previously Covid-19 case count could 6 24 times higher official estimates, CDC study Gottlieb (former head FDA) said thought [30% US would infected end comes 4x number cases time.

If say something like 4-5x US 28 million cases, 112-128 million 34-39% population exposed. Add 15% vaccinated would explain drop cases... basically we're getting 50% immune closer herd immunity. makes perfect sense really; removing body's way responding potential attack means side effects actually last longer could potentially even make worse (primarily fever). pretty real lockdown Illinois. least Chicago places near stupid title don’t think it’s said hah. Also nice Biden inaugurated switched stance cycle threshold PCR-tests significantly lower advise negatively testing without symptoms, thus lowering case numbers.

And mainstream news went ""cases surged"" ""cases decreasing"" one day.

I'm America favour Biden Trump, political even clear outsider. depends, children traveling automobile see people? going visiting people near swimming pool bathtub? so, better stop honestly evaluate risks compared childhood injury mortality COVID. Good, fuck'em shitty overvalued IPOs. COVID parties like old chicken pox parties. Get people protected fast sharpest tool shed, you?  


How mistake, ""There *yet* definitive scientific evidence proving mask usage important, go buy ton... YET."" ""Masks harmful never worn!""???  


It's super depressing thing see many god damned people either understand scientific process works purposefully pretend understand works. :( lipids facility sits Alabama, though. Croda owner. tens millions people U.S. gotten covid-19 could claim get work, would way anyone know.

And reason none claims hold court. community spread literally everywhere. There's way prove got work Walmart buying groceries. sinovac vaccine also option? stored household refirgerator main vaccine applied Chile That’s good thing. Oh indeed! hobble along better option, let us hobble. Ok yeah. I’m wondering need something drastic/if Covid extremely deadly. cannot classes tiny home apartment kids. also boyfriend friends bubble university (which risk I’m willing take mental health, obviously Covid bad we’ve lots outbreaks campus everyone survived). I’m basically trying grasp bad new variant news is. spend lot time library hanging people public spaces I’m hoping didn’t become dangerous. one household Covid, one person receives vaccine, transmit Covid others vaccinated household? No, would mean 1% chanc (let's say older condition) would 1.7%. young healthy 0.01%, would 0.017%, even less significant increase. Lmao understanding US unlikely bother AZ due issue discussing, options logistically challenging. think might hope J&amp;J might work though. love India manufacturing generic medicines. medicine autoimmune condition would've costed 4000 month US (from Pfizer) costs 30$ India excluding including dosing error folks, inflated AZ’s results? first read headline. Like tf turkey detect Covid?? Thanks India . Honestly, experience DnD one things almost seems like pulled well online. Things like Roll20 mean aspects like battle visualization preplanned done zero additional equipment (though, expense face-to-face contact) Compared lockdowns we've NZ think China gone far.

We literally allowed go 2 supermarket chains (small grocers shut down) pharmacy military/police deployed highways make sure people driving anywhere.

England's level 5 lockdowns right even strict current 3-day lockdown Auckland, New Zealand level 4 even harsher. anyone know Path Herd Immunity calculator take account immunity one vaccination only? total, effective doses, significantly hinder virus progression. That's ten days later 😉 answer pay grade. believe interpreted thesis accurately. didnt know anyone covid colleges started again, 4 friends went party, got covid. Hello, Department Redundancy Department Oh god comment thread history disgusting  You’re sad human being, seek mental help please Stop trying sell us dud. what's controversy new UK varient fatality data? say 70% deadly, numbers reflect that? Fauci using incomplete data? misinformation vaccines varient? OOTL one. need work getting first doses up. overall doses gone up, first dose actually slightly ticked 7 day average. 

First doses need hit 1.5-2 million day, around 950-975k atm thing gives US right? teacher husband Nevada gets second dose Friday. county made sure get fairly early simply need childcare. teachers fought conservative county government still thinks hoax, flu.  alone outlined governor, knows. meant workplace injuries  

If got COVID-19 work public facing work tightly packed, workplace injury.  

For example massive outbreaks meat-packing plants, tens workers worked tight quarters without distancing masks. We'll caring Covid far effects *public health* whole. We'll taking measures (including social restrictions) Covid still threat public health. Why? useless vaccines widespread. you’re rich complaining. Wow— everyone shocked victim complex No, selfish, narcissistic people think. Think someone, anyone teammates. Except mutates someone immune compromised you’re screwed too. Remember China didn’t lockdown, would’ve speed spread everywhere else due commerce trade.

It’s given doesn’t become super deadly. CureVac deliveries projected pretty small least Q2 Q3, mostly Biontech/Pfizer, Moderna J&amp;J AZ. Japan tested 7.9 Million People officially concern high amount positive cases young Adults. Look COVAX program, notice clear absentee. That's hear much news, USA part it. see. bathrooms basically public, it’s right choice wear mask. 

It depends personal comfort level many factors. classes entirely online, example, would argue cost stress living dorms pandemic isn’t worth it. would say didn’t enjoy dorms option commute. particularly high risk. 

But situation isn’t dire enough move don’t want to. It’s anymore dangerous since last March. God he's dumbass. blame China tell people mask he'd cruise election.

Instead make whole thing US politics hundreds thousands Americans dead countless others long term damage. moron.  I’m unironically planning mask burning party first opportunity...

Of course, I’ll keep couple around get sick, chance mask mandates get reinstated outbreak road. hate things lol think would really emotionally freeing. 

/u/LoyalbutAnxious invited he/she wants someone them, let’s remove mandate prolong sounds surreal. stay 2 weeks flatten curve feel need wear two masks. know would get vaccine dad, one risk, makes feel secure safe, go ahead. Yeah, that's bullshit. ""could be"" master universe, too. say things certainty purely speculation non-scientific sources. short lockdowns? even weeks per year like 10% year. export ban, good contract negotiation. EU let team. wonder von der Leyen pressure resign. Don’t worry, EU learned lesson. vaccines countries including UK contracts EU fulfilled. Simple? Simple. EU enough power money force company fulfill contract. family call yesterday people listened podcast road trip. Heard get 2nd vaccine shot conscience since superior model showed people wait, another spike incoming dumb states opening up. hold laughter first mention Osterholm talking spike coming. think I'm wasting time here. want take Fauci's wildly incorrect statements scientifically accurate? Feel free so. wear N95 mask. There's nothing stop you. want believe argument relevance, may so. want claim feelings matter irrelevant....I really care. They're clearly though. Hand sanitizer different washing hands. cleans/sanitizes hands point time, happens between. Jumping queue. invest more. investment, generally understood one increases production facilities, examples. UK so, hoarded -if reports right UK published contract- included export bans contracts.

All would ok me, also sources EU. 

Here problem begins. 

I mind EU and/or member states used sovereignty limit exports countries undue share vaccine produce fair share reached. like UK does. admitted lied... know, right? anti-maskers sound like normal people.

It's insane believe stuff. masks somehow restricting autonomy. 2-3 weeks deliveries AZ, Pfizer Moderna get EU countries somewhere around 16% Countries like Denmark, currently administering everything receive week could probably get number far 16%. Yes it’s perhaps overly optimistic make claim, point supply get much, much better coming weeks. Yeah, we've gotten used wearing them. feels weird outside without mask now. suppose inconvenience poorly-fitting mask falls fogs glasses, that's easily fixed. said watched can’t remember talked about?

That goes show didn’t talk anything important engaging, proves point swept rug. Ok thanks. even read wrote. I'm saying need wear masks indefinitely. I'm saying wearing mask great sacrifice.

Wear mask say safe take off. Well know touch face. easily easily unconscious action many times. That's I'm saying. stop: one buying silly argument. allow something it. EU vaccines exported exporting them. least understand it, it’s stigma people previously ignoring thus prolonging lockdowns baselessly deciding shit science greater good people whole. turn resulted making people’s empathetic response callous calculated. worse, better. go on. want go naked (well, maybe now, there's ice there...but maybe summer). go mall naked I'm going get arrested, put jail, put sex-offender list life.

Why choice go naked restricted? AUTONOMY RESTRICTED! I’m really sorry happening you. I’m sorry vaccines people wanting exit strategy. I’m sure that’s hard you. good see authorities proactive instead reactive covid change. hopefully needed much feared good plans set things dealt much speed possible.  [Working available month](http://news.gov.vn/Home/Festivals-cancelled-vaccine-import-becomes-priority/20212/42994.vgp)

Just hope keep lid current outbreak adequate supplies. Lol. see downvotes. yeah I'm sure. wear everyday ever since governor lifted mandates. Every mandate, even group size. I'm freedom safe assume get now. people wearing mask. heck everyone think virus went. Inter-racial marriage, segregation, same-sex marriage became il/legal overnight. ones happened living memory US.

When major events like wars happen, drafts rationing change life moment's notice. Or, know, global pandemic. Please let us know find? contributed explanation that, reply nonsensical. Yes isn’t really news. Sadly true. Health departments everywhere apparently staffed either trolls recluses, maybe one 'a little column A, little column B' type deals regard. talking about? UK ordered vaccines stipulated amount needed, getting vaccines paid for? trust betrayed exactly? Trump certainly eroded public trust. doubt. c'mon. Fauci every opportunity speak well. Instead refused condemn single trump statement. one. Now, understand want lose job. holy hell. man 80 years old. lose? Show spine. "" Um, yeah. actually inject disinfectant, frankly, listen anything moron saying"". Instead.....he praised man. Right TV. over. larger problem don’t seem understand anecdotal evidence is. Lots people defied restrictions contributed heavily virus's spread. Heck, even getting people wear mask major point contention West. there's still data two shot regime come well Technically deliver April still delivering June. country producing vaccines (edit: ok maybe China is, that's different story)

Who said wonder? People used stuff times kind long distance communication alarming strange me.

I'm referring people STILL Zoom happy hours friends live within 30 minute radius they're afraid germs something guess. That's borderline insane behavior point. go buddy's house already drinks whatever do. make miserable strictly isolating point? Yea. 100% workhorse vaccine sent places -80 cold storage even -20 moderna. course jobs many complexities analogue requirements

I've workforce 25 years. know adult job responsibilities looks like.

And yes, I'll double statement. insane value in-person education students. activity anywhere close power eliminate poverty destroy racial cultural barriers.

And yet teachers moved faster anyone else society shirk responsibility. junk. trial 100% effective preventing hospitalization death, even patients infected South Africa variant.  Much like UK (where I'm from) pretty much every regular hospital surgeon earns Prime Minister. course requirements President Prime Minister far lower medical professional. 

Please correct wrong believe *only* requirements US President 1) natural-born American 2) 35 years old 3) US resident past 14 years. 

Fauci earns good salary sure. Around $450k read. really understand point though sorry. could easily left public healthcare earn ten times year private sector. Hell work AIDS back 80s could easily gone pharmaceutical business probably billionaire wanted. money primary motivator awful job capitalising status *the* world class infectious disease expert past decades say?  give people less likely show follow-up appointment. makes sense. I'm sure countries vaccinate athletes support condition part games. still sixty days left ""100 Days Masking,"" lift mask mandates. countries seemed fine accepting risk, EU 3 months later UK? Negotiating financial liability global pandemic one stupid fucking things heard. Sorry dont see ""rather reasonable"" EU sending truck loads cash questions asked. cost lockdowns effect economies means take risks. EU paying price commissions lack foresight, commission EU state leaders havr also managed convince people UK bad guy this. Remarkable. result eroded people’s trust health officials caused widespread confusion skepticism masks persists day

That claim. already quoted it, question bizarre. value money says that? UK never banned vaccine money donations problem, mightily generous UK countries donate, also EU issue lack planning wanted use AZs UK facilities wanted share UK resources contract UK never banned. story friend understand what's point here. people always going get infected multiple times. Immune systems identical sometimes misbehave. time, solid evidence average person worry severe reinfection developing antibodies via infection vaccine. would consider custom requires cover half face (once considered bizarre west) - treated “no big deal.” Maybe isn’t. 

Customs don’t change dramatically fast. Japan wants allow Olympics, going allow people vaccinated Japanese time games happen. actually happen... Exactly this. Send hard send vaccines. replying someone denying obvious. False. EU export vaccines UK. Companies manufacturing operations member states companies export vaccines customers. No. even mass vaccination, best case scenario cases still trickle open up. question long continue lockdown every time there’s new cluster cases? may think obvious, I've seen people throw strawman around recently 100% serious. linked South Africa, people got infected original virus, recovered, got reinfected … South African variant — tells us prior infection protect reinfection, least particular variant,” Fauci added.

To clear, trying snarky contrary, came across way. said disagrees, meant said offer protection, opposed protection. think he's making gross assumptions based little data (and maybe factually correct be) agenda, that's keep people safe. family January hope whatever protect us come contact S.A. variant. Children learn recognize faces without looking mouth. trouble recognizing people mask on, children much adaptable issues. No. It’s likely people’s immune systems don’t well covid winter. decently established point people reinfected South Africa strain virus before. talking (honest question)?

As far know, vaccine production Switzerland, filling/packaging takes place EU. way US awarded AZ 1.2 billion R&amp;D grants UK EU everywhere else getting shots, US even getting emergency approval them. Based logic means US entitled shots? I'v person since August hybrid. think could gotten schools hybrid spring. took months school get ready fall semester terms scheduling procuring PPE. saw behind scenes work get hybrid going school. monstrous task. think even possible software wise schedule kids early summer.

Yes, kids dropping grades failing. one disputes that. cant pack 25 kids room five days week right now. might well pack movie theaters. sent hundreds personalized communications made countless phone calls trying get kids work. 

I teach high school appreciate much different elementary. Totally different ball game there. age group really come lack responsibility. come live streams, watch pre-recorded videos, respond emails messages. Besides packing 25 people five days week, suppose do? kids work, nothing works. Thanks! 

I penis! said denied existence 'rona? would rather deny existence screw others covidiocy.

On contrary, lockdowns causing suffering, pain, economic damage eventually deaths. flu+ could ever do. like reason become global pandemic.

For believe authority virus think change behavior affect damage deal type megalomania. can't play god, virus incredibly small travel air, can't anything it. Masks disinfecting farce, changed sort ritualistic principle new covid religion. Please wake see virus bad give immunesystems chance weaponize covid. /rant I'm going say it, fuck Cuomo, hes blaming everyone Nursing home catastrophe.

We trust doctors science. people complain way things never go back normal. many sub (and government officials) seems completely fine way life. article people previously infected, vaccinated. Yeah, SD rockin tourist scene LOL Als het verdergaat met die virus wappies en het kabinetsbeleid?
Tss. Misschien oktober 2022? hasn’t dropped you? vaccine card says got Pfizer vaccine. informational hand given also says Pfizer. word biontech written anywhere it. 

That probably US known Pfizer vaccine anything else would scare confuse people.

I think medical code name something different would include charge number stuff well, looks something like love people project mEdiA don’t notice *who wrote article first place* Um fuck Olympics.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* ""Not time"" equal lying. lie distancing, washing hands, abstaining face touching. facts science supported mask use: recommended mask use. double 'choice' like idiot. responsible idiots refusing wear masks made conditions. Firstly, I'm assuming comment discussing US. I'm renders said irrelevant anything saying. ***FULL*** lockdown, actually adhered actually enforced, period two months eradicate virus whichever area locked down. No, mean literally everyone literally stuck homes two months. means indoor dining, every single person work home work home. Everyone can't work home job absolutely must done government pay wages. Protective equipment measures businesses need stay open. Restaurants delivery take out, grocery stores allow curbside pickup. 

This work, UK 3 months last year reduced cases came nowhere close eradicating virus. We're 3 months obvious get anywhere near eradication. much across Europe. Aside countries fairly low population borders completely sealed idea eradicate Covid lockdowns absurd, even requires permanently closed borders. many people essential keeping country functioning basic level interact degree ever get blame someone's shitty behavior lockdowns. COVID make people abuse assault others, chose it. 

Are seriously engaging bad faith claiming I'm excusing domestic abuse? Obviously individuals responsible. policies created opportunities carry abusive behaviour less options victims escape, people notice level abuse they're suffering from. conclusion line thinking would also never enact policy reduce domestic abuse. all, policy make right? catch up, bring bullshit never catch up. Furthermore, entire year, there's enough time improve remote learning younger children. 

It's bullshit all. UK education experts recently stated worried substantial number children never catch up. Particularly disadvantaged background. Remote learning especially lacking children. apparently somehow know better? overwhelming majority failed businesses lost jobs need happen. government could paid wages prevent layoffs issued halts mortgage lease payments.

Basically happen here. However even vast support business given cracks showing. There's limit long artificially hold together economy we'll reaching breaking point no. people said hoax, said affect anyone 80, wear mask, pay people stay home. 

Ok? could stopped thing tracks done ***actual*** lockdown last March, April, May, June, literally time including now. chose to, fuck want freedom. 

As said, 'actual lockdown' (and across Europe), provides benefit limited amount time. gets nowhere even close eradication. Instead two months really shitty lockdown we've year fake lockdown people like you. cause thing whine. 

You've made many (utterly wrong) assumptions nationality, politics, worldview evidence. laughable. AZ fast track Japan, Moderna even approved May. Absolutely. like wearing one, small inconvenience creates better situation everyone. opinion piece. People see teachers priority teachers willing teach person without vaccines. Really failure labor rights collective bargaining. landlords live places they're building. fact, seems like ask people living actually want inside all. they're built would helpful nice living. constantly fight code regulations cut costs cut corners. that's every apartment ends thinnest walls shittiest bathtubs place wash car quick tune-up even bicycle let alone vehicle wash dog.

 I'd also love mini library supplies everybody needs awhile everybody needs like printer, industrial three-hole punch, paper slicer etc. Space power tool use. communal spot kids would great even those. Thoroughly stocked board game room would doped especially concessions. Tiny movie theater would legit also. 

My complex alone enough people make things worth it. believe garment thinking keeps face warm winter called scarf... fun say whatever want without sources act like fact Even von der Leyen admits EU fucked up, enough save job? People across EU member states furious failed appallingly leaders Ireland, certainly, never degree trust EU. EU astroturfing social media serving draw attention failures. cares AZ? barely works variants become universal basically worthless. line reasoning existed Asia decades - people wear masks smog bad sick, big deal. conditions go away, wear masks. Pretty simple. EU using moderna vaccines, they've vaccinated moderna month terms deadly transmissible far seem advantages Uk variant. sense much concern hopefully become dominant strain. 

There issues regarding immunity seem reduce immunity vaccines. Novavax saw drop 85% 60% South African variant. J&amp;J also saw drop well. AZ seems worst affected small trial showed minimal protection mild moderate symptoms. Although participants we're young healthy can't draw real conclusions study. there's chance may still prevent severe symptoms hospitlisations. Moderna/pfizer trial data lab studies suggest works still would naive think still offers 95% protection. likely vaccines still atleast prevent severe symptoms hospitlisations even reduced efficiency mild moderate symptoms. several working booster shots.

TL;dr: reduced efficiency vaccines still likely atleast prevent severe symptoms/hospitlisations still offer protection mild moderate symptoms albeit greatly reduced efficiency. Thanks info!

Denmark really good job, given circumstances. Keep up! Anyone else seen John Oliver Episode Next Pandemic? highly recommend Yes shame people starting question things ten months experts suddenly saying “actually, maybe need two masks” Again, provided zero evidence states based policy New York.

These people continued test positive symptoms improved, happens 90+ days someone longer contageous. people still contageous. There's zero evidence policy lead increase deaths. Austria, 3 percent vaccinated. empty platitude? make misleading comments beginning? 

Obama deserved nobel prize? merely George Bush?

Cuomo deserved Emmy book handing pandemic despite current investigations juked stats. Actually governments whatever fuck want. Contracts paper. Austria Yeah people are, think intentionally, taking literally saying like ""it 1% burdensome *wrong*"", agree aspects mask wearing inconvenient, compared global pandemic killed stupid amount people feels pretty small. even top ten total deaths per million. total cases per million. 

They didn’t lock they’re better USA. possible? AstraZeneca broken contract informing EU contract can’t fulfilled time. 

AstraZeneca didn’t anything deliver promised vaccines EU. 

AstraZeneca exports vaccines UK. 

UK also didn’t hesitate get everything possible EU, including developed EU using money EU vaccine Biontech meantime telling us stupid EU smart Bo Johnson. 

Are happy? Ok. forget. multiple states lift mandates, others join too. Eventually New York. giving example situation would presumably agree saving lives lead happiness. I'm happy saving lives right now, hate living like this. problematic variants become dominant could become legitimate source public health inequity, ""something people complain about""

probably better allocate based age underlying vulnerabilities [The Propaganda Multiplier – Swiss Policy Research Nothing wrong getting tests, get tested regularly work. comes requirement travel, apprehension.

Let’s say want make routine 1.5 hour flight. would need buy ticket (not cheap), take full 2 weeks precaution eliminate risk wouldn’t test positive, thus voiding ticket purchase. hassle worth people? Probably. I’m one them.

Plus like good road trip. One see, read opinions contract. priority get vaccines now, instead winning court case five years. Export limits would doable way. UK welcomed sue EU, member states AstraZeneca court get win five years time. behind really depends long takes vaccinate population. That's kind going determinant going 90 percent normal 100% normal opinion. Yes made clear won’t cancel
