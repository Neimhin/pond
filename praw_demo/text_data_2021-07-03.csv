i'm little lazy see true MO, unvaccinated population tends younger general population, could well different hospitalization death trends pre-vaccine days. Right it’s weird.

I know people expecting US. Iran Brazil two countries dealing arguably unending waves.  charts nuts. Also great idea also covid right now. doctor said seeing huge surge cases, vaccinated not.

That's there's lot vaccine hesitancy. know several people get covid barely symptoms causes massive divide. Personally everyone knew covid pretty well still got vaccinated believe vaccine better getting covid itself. agree people getting vaccinated wish reddit would stop get vaccinated get put ICU brigade.

This get political debate. Even outside trump rallies contribute virus spreading...it outside therefore spread virus cause wind sunlight.

Nothing going change people’s behaviour (except people return normal) going get revolutionary new vaccines work 100% time everyone.

Let. It. Go. CDC messaging qnd public policy mind rather science . We've seen say masks helpful COVID vaccines 100% prevent deaths, things untrue messaging purposes. That's quote youngavr was.

There never case vaccine failing. Ivan Drago: “If die, die.” combination capacity restrictions continued mask wearing would ideal. Particularly mask wearing, concrete evidence Singapore vaccinated people capable spreading Delta variant, even asymptomatic. Yeah harder vaccines available. Suddenly half potential hosts longer viable. Sorry sorry. Welcome rest world, Australia! Party’s over. Really? Groundbreaking science right here. Better protection does, fact, mean better protection. actually zero evidence virus do. idea evolved virus look like.

Plus, us vaccinated little point, part keep community spread down, would us now? article involving rationality, logic, exposure reality? god! Cool. keep pushing ideas don’t work, I’m going remind US even question state right enforce vaccination individual interests might yield state laws endeavour protect health everybody—the “common good.” court said: “The rights individual may times, pressure great dangers, subjected restraint enforced reasonable regulations safety general public may want brush public health history. know lock people bed refuse follow drug resistant TB quarantine order? agree chance (With supply, end next month so), things reopen?

Umbrella labor union holds street rally despite virus concerns Hard say certain, doubt deaths/cases ration unreliable.

On one hand, lot people know COVID mild form without taking test (which adds headache mandatory quarantine/monitoring additional one already due COVID), besides, flu/cold cases quarantined negative tests arrives. mostly second wave.

On hand, UK twice much per capita new cases 30-70 times less deaths Russia. country may underreporting cases deaths, ratio stay roughly same. first wave, Russia underrepoted COVID-related deaths (and one lowest official death/cases ratio world). doubt chose report deaths accurately underreport cases. [Not true Europe, particularly France, *a lot* anti-vaxxers. Russian numbers reliable tho? What's +ve rate?

If anything. Russian numbers would understating pandemic level.. kind confusing honest. ignored. heard, acknowledged, summarily dismissed unimportant, lot people decided they're done nothing convince care anymore. Countries like NZ already back normal, quite time now.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   make vaccine climate change please! jump done, I'm threat you, go get pissed anti-vaxxers. surge hospitalizations? slight uptick. Deaths 10% peak. things tend correlation. absolutely Smithsonian. saying entire vaccine exhibit, focus **why** make big fucking deal everyone taking vaccine first place. vaccine hesitancy factors behind dont forget learn it. 


We need know we've done shit ourselves. easy look back upon 1918. epidemics happening frequently, preserving critical elements pandemic important. 

The role front line workers critical. also moment time millions first world people started pretending care standard living even lives health care essential workers society started paying attention. maybe try cdc, entertainment news tv show: paragraph. I'm fully vaccinated, manage get COVID-19, COVID-19 test able tell it, show false negative? brother telling would show false negative antibodies, something nature... really understand said.

And long one hypothetically contracts COVID-19 see have/had COVID-19? in, test would show negative instead positive? many weeks day first got symptoms? Seems strange OTT. like almost everything else pandemic. missed entire point read said? lot us straight CANNOT AFFORD ANYMORE. get isn’t problem people health problems MUCH ASK continue ask people lose sanity income extremely small percentage people want vaccine, can’t get it, high risk death. financial fall probably health hazard point. Expect kids 12. Ok point isn’t inside safe too? don’t really choice. Obviously they’re effective vaccine better vaccine. No, truly concerning scenario vaccinated people start getting *sick*. *That* gives anti-vaxxers ammunition. best way stop crushing COVID continued chances mutate.

For now, it’s abundantly clear vaccines reduce personal risk illness - alone enough incentive get vaccinated anyone. promise never vaccines would prevent safety measures necessary. Tokyo streets full one seems care covid anymore, government probably mulling whatever mull end nothing. mess :’) laws asked getting vaccine even hesitate. said thing I've injected much crap probably never would gotten point bother all. masks I've done much uncomfortable shit throughout career I'm cry piece fabric.  borders, exiled citizens massive lockdowns normal. I’ve talking people lately, discussing vaccine. it, simply don’t know effects years now. seriously didn’t know tell them. help? don’t want make love vaccine, least consider country tens hundreds thousands dead people certainly normal. Sorry. Ah, completely ignored comment then.  people man take damn pin prick arm. really freaking simple.

The immunocompromised never great vaccine solution. solution vaccinate public keep community spread low possible.

But government opened preemptively, leaving zero incentive antivaxxers apathetic people reason vaccinate. We've stagnated vaccinations let immunocompromised people governments set vaccination percentage goals.

A shot arm general public freaking simple solution this. No, know word ""normal"" means entirely dependent whether vaccine-resistant strain COVID emerges. countries trust vaccine cards US? seems plainly obvious - there’s precedent making like 10 billion vaccines ASAP. It’s something enough materials/factories for. 

It’s like Moldova Eritrea going able download recipe independently make mRNA vaccine. Government OVERREACH!!! /sssss polls hold anywhere near bad rollout actually started. Try two months, month open, another five months come back me. mean shit probably deaths there, would near impossible reach insane number deaths countries didn’t handle well. I’m guessing live country lot deaths it’s upsetting you. That's article two years ago. western European countries way substantially people vaccinated US. think things reopen restrictions dropped everyone chance fully vaccinated. really big deal. Anecdotally, lot people L.A. already still mask indoors, including family; today stopped grocery store 2 3 people wearing them. Every single person Dollar Tree masked. 

L.A. got hit HARD last Dec-Jan, total lost 25k people. peak January hit 20k new cases hundreds deaths every day. Hospitals running oxygen treating people hallways parking lot tents. Ambulances waiting 10 hours unload patients. morgues funeral homes overflowed. really dark times us city, easy shake off. Coronavirus really stable, common cold coronavirus spread every winter million people never mutated something worse least century (maybe tracing XX century). seems lot little variations made possible spread every year without big hassles. Pure luck. Australia has. 

Even ever reach 85%, deaths still inevitable. feel like people saying easy book appointment must NRW Berlin somewhere else, absolutely right, impossible here. I'm group 4 living south Munich got first shot 3 days ago Impfzentrum point able find single doctor within 30km could book appointment with, despite actively searching since April. NZ isn’t opening tourists 85% population vaccinated. I’m sure that’s difficult understand. “massive” “national” lockdowns simply untrue haven’t national lockdown year. Yeah DNA viruses lot stable. That’s could wipe smallpox. DNA double helix, lot stable single strand RNA. Unfortunately COVID RNA virus, prone mutations. study - showed seasonality weak overall effect (you see submission history) Unless Sinovac modified lately, see effective AZ probably worse vs variant. mean fourth July celebration big event fireworks usually like food blue bathrooms go still outside... no? guess there's real bathrooms also really scared vaccine wear mask go bathroom. still eating outside, watching fireworks outside, enjoying friends outside, outside. Oh GOD piece FABRIC! tyranny!

It's like numerous east Asian countries wear masks regular basis dramatically lower cases fewer restrictions.

Oh wait... lol Deaths utterly inevitable open up. 

Sealed borders, exiled citizens massive lockdowns normal. compare UK Chile. vaccination program mainly Sinovac. We're currently discussing whether give third shot Sinovac users, people saying immunization vaccine long people becoming sick. wish richer bought Pfizer Moderna shots :&lt;.

This delta bs becoming disgusting time goes on, feel like we'll go another wave even worse... expecting return normal life soon. would impossible countries many deaths year half. NZ back normal now, whether like not. Sorry. offense months falling deaf ears folks almost year half now, fades time society wants get back normal need provide alternatives immunocompromised people able get essentials done; like earn income, able shop groceries visit doctor relatively risk free environment. cannot done government needs step provide that.

We largely cannot protect since earn living go house get essentials need live lives. want attend sporting events, concerts, travel airplanes, want basics without risking necks. Uhm.

Nature did, created COVID-19, successfully stopped time. I’m reluctant test headache I’m terrified nasal swabs. I’m really sensitive them.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Don’t y’all bathrooms inside year half heard first time. Unfortunately countries aren’t close normal yet. look US 300 deaths day, compared VN 1-2, Australia 1 NZ 0. think they’ve become numb tragic is. second Pfizer shot yesterday evening, feel like trash, muscle soreness, fatigue, chills. expect like this. Mutations random. However evolution based fitness, making die isn’t makes virus fit. Viruses want infect people.  Yeah inside rallies obviously spread virus like crazy. Outside ones spread much. hate trump like every progressive person still going follow science... sunlight wind outside even without masks there's basically chance spread. could eating huge parties there's little chance spread. Unless kissing person spreading kisses around spreading virus.. inside rallies yes obviously one said spreading virus. **did** outside rallies.. body makes antibodies virus infected, even vaccinated infection. part immune response. 


People ""unprotected"" higher virus loads produce generations virus particle. Neither. lack ability make timely decisions. like Way Barn   Well, got Pfizer shot one Moderna shot two (today). Let's see goes Yes. fully vaccinated least eight weeks. Don’t really go many places either. I'm mad them. I'm sorry comes way. want people understand we're different boats chaotic killer ocean look best can. protect family also can. know I'm lucky afford stay away everyone. wish still, do. year half rest first world back living lives two years No. Masks signify wearer want contribute spread ongoing global deadly airborne viral pneumonia pandemic. think every Australian overseas 'traveling' you? 

Yeah, let's uproot families, quit jobs go home live mum collect welfare. not, totally fault miss weddings, funerals, ability say goodbye dying family members. 

The lack empathy coming lot Australians right disheartening. fully vaccinated? so, wouldn’t worry it. Got second today, month first, since city Ontario delta hot spot Doesn’t hurt get tested seems much likely it’s allergies. live. I’d see maybe 10% kids masked guidelines say unvaccinated needs masked. Hang there! RiteAid gave 3 dates first dose enough people 4 weeks later *could* make argument compliance wasn’t good winter surge, you’d acknowledge it’s even lower they’re optional vaccinated people. Unfortunately cases deaths lot countries aren’t anywhere close “normal”. lockdown cities days minor inconvenience compared countries like US UK struggling year now. choice countries Sinovac Pfizer. Sinovac nothing. Obviously, Sinovac better nothing. article, hospitalizations 44% week week. Church camp... ya go. least agree vaccines work. It’s also good news people getting vaccinated not. mean hospitals won’t overwhelmed. I’m trying hopeful trying great summer. hope find hope great summer. You’re mad wrong person. mad anti-vaxxers. year half rest first world back living lives two years, Australia still locking cities every time someone coughs, politicians going start bad time. Yeah, pattern makes think first antigen test false positive. hope feel better soon. vaccines also give resistance. Fully vaccinated people catch spread still Majority BLM protesters wearing masks, spread controlled. know wearing masks caused spread? Trump Rallys. one's gonna masking July 4th festivities, they're piss drunk squeezed together like sardines crowd around bar buy drinks. 

Here's article Trump Rallys:  seatbelts airbags get recalled much testing, probability covid vaccines recalled year public use?  someone says allergic vaccine component

I discussed numerous times replies. chances allergic COVID-19 vaccine small, need treated common occurrence. one conditions make vaccination risky

Do mind specifying exactly conditions hypothetical prison

I personally think productive entertain hypothetical get ignore basic medical care vaccines stiches antibiotics basically self-harm. like get assault others prison.

I would argue comparison choosing get vaccine assaulting others prison (and even self-harm) false equivalency (ignoring differences orders magnitude things basic medical care vaccine protects person every inmate guard/staff/visitor premises.

The vaccine decreases risk hospitalization amount viral load *only* individual vaccinated, individual unvaccinated terms transmission, sufficient evidence COVID-19 vaccines decrease transmission, even so, vaccinated protected. 

Overall, think idea forcing vaccinations prisoners goes precedent (as requirement now) goes bodily autonomy. want think know better health, fantasize being, ""in change bodies caged,"" free think that. Wait, what? We’re talking covid here, virus killed thousands (or hundreds thousands), overwhelmed healthcare systems, kept kids schools, etc. That’s certainly relevant and, someone living country similar strategy NZ, way hell would want live kind “normal”. much truth here, man. fear parents kids keeping locked years. may generation socially/educationally inept adults decade this, that’ll far worse kids pandemic ever was. Also Canadian here, track beat US second doses within 2-3 weeks current speed vaccination across country vs slowing speed. passed first doses large margin behind months. 

Supply issues aside, Canada track vaccinated place planet due lower hesitancy rates. Truth bomb. Silly question: I’ve headache since yesterday. symptoms except runny nose stopped soon took Allegra. need get tested? weather changing - humid.  1. It‘s highly unlikely anything going change much next months would make waiting beneficial.

2. We’ve hearing “just wait weeks/months” year now. point, end, countries widespread vaccination available, time now. Unless finishes FDA, probably somewhere list. 10 seconds probably statistical outlier. Presumably infections needed minute. Russian Roulette. poor bugger got unlucky. Whether that’s normal completely irrelevant whether sealed border normal.

Leaving vaccinated citizens exile 2023 isn’t normal either. Vaccines way out, need dumbasses wake get jab. I’m tired going people believe conspiracy theories refuse vaccinate. kids eligible vaccinated whole family “safe” F everyone chooses get vaccine, going back living normal life get sick refused shot, tough cookies. Recommend 4. Yeah, don’t understand people expect us act differently past. I’m vaccinated, I’m going back normal. part. don’t stop world flu every year even though costs lives. We’re going stop Covid vaccines exist, either. live life. life lockdown damn close life worth living lot us. first time got flu years ago age 21, lifetime thinking flu another type cold, took doctor thinking literally dying sick. entire body never felt like giant bag rotten meat before, holy hell bs knocked ass. Can’t imagine much worse would little kid older person you’re saying letting hundreds citizens die every day normal? I'm taking bet. 
...I want loose paycheck. understand. 

We right thing got vaccinated made bad guys anti vaxxers get scot free! WTH? least let rip find unvaccinated Yeah, would fine people weren’t throwing away ordered due 1 million issues. That's hoped coronavirus, like spanish flu, weather changes herd immunity, would stop spreading. Unfortunately, never happened, coronavirus continued spread alarming rate months went matter weather herd immunity never developed. vaccine come November last year, infection death rate would unthinkable right now. started (Turkey) giving third shot biontech already got two shot sinovac whose age 50 really think first cases covid back November 2019 already mutation virus got contagious covid already among us entire year. 

Is documentation ? UK started randomised trial Ivermectin last week. provide definitive answer whether works. way say view. [Ivermectin  hell that. Magic? months thing year. Honestly it’s parody point. COVID never going go away. least many many years. Nobody opening flood gates. vaccines available, time move stop looking case numbers. data hospitalizations shows falling. Cases matter. Talking Uk 1daysooner really early player this. don’t know volunteers ever actually recruited database, remember one earlier places could indicate interest volunteering trials (April Seatbelts made scientists.. said previously pandemic going end. vaccines massive roll don’t see even close end. went 2 weeks flatten curve shit show year later. COVID carry many many years, everybody going get vaccinated unfortunately. hospitalization rates low, must carry lives. Simply risk right low vaccines! cannot ask collective financial societal suffering another year. lives ruined gonna pile up. (This logic applies considering available vaccines adults) sad read this. 

What describe probably one important cause problems fungus also described elsewhere.

It shame international help practice solidarity planet becoming small. could saved many people. sincerely hope future, humans pull better together.  think it’s time accept COVID literally never going end. Best get family vaccinated move life. It’s impossible ask population live financial ruin another year keep people safe, they’ve done could well get vaccinated. hospitalization rates low, must carry lives. COVID around many many years. Except Neil played massive important role first man moon, already superlative extraordinary person (which picked mission moon) whereas first vax patient could’ve literally anyone training. understand part upset people, hope great weekend.thanks kind words No, there’s mechanism unblind. I’m sure participants must unblinded. 

In case specifically, you’d want participants given placebo go get vaccination, notifying participants vaccinated duplicate vaccine.  yesterday. 18 today. 16 NSW less half yesterday's number. Hopefully Sydney lockdown working.  makes sense. Read antibody affinity maturation body produces better antibodies time, albeit less quantities. countries currently locked down? people like you, could ended pandemic last year. someone country primarily importing Sinopharm we're paying something like $15-$20 per dose

Just incase anyone thought Chinese ones cheaper Moderna Pfizer part kills don’t people would simply walk clinic get free shot. It’s truly maddening actions idiots (or rather inaction) affect rest!  signifier relative intelligence, sure. social class? Naw. Like access mRNA wouldn’t use it. don’t defend themselves, could get one, still better nothing.  kind despise sorts headlines. point, anyone thinks vaccines going kill them/sterilise them/ etc. convinced this, anything they'll label propaganda.

But people *do* want vaccine can't get put another state panic, really necessary. able get first dose yesterday probably get second quite live country really great track record Covid vaccinations. Christ mate, you’ve got live life Well degree doesnt make good doctor. Maybe getting comments like ""LOOK NON SYSTEM DOCTOR CONGRATS DOC THANKS (MIS)INFORMING US"" enough forget oath, maybe profiting way misinforming people, maybe unethical Thank answer. Actually resembles situation many countries. Even Norway running arms first shots certain municipalities, give doses back national government.

I think countries rather large group wants vaccine, doesn’t need right now. great pandemic either. unmotivated gained weight. That's doctor then, propably fake degree notify authorities  Sure, basal metabolic rate shift percent there, nothing significant 2 sodas fries day. 

But main point financial bootstrapping argument always significant systemic external forces. increase money means break wage structure place, requires education, opportunity, luck, perhaps geographical relocation. decrease money requires lower taxation, lower healthcare costs, lower accomodation costs.

Drinking water instead soda offset shift basal metabolic rate. Eating green leafy vegetables legumes instead calorie dense nutrient poor food one meal day make significant impact. that's hard, walk road twice day. 

The real difficulty seems one embedded lifestyle stagnation disconnect behaviour outcome. slows spread down, stop it. current vaccines stop infections version virus. stop infected people passing virus on, though make significantly difficult. People vaccinated Pfizer AstraZeneca jabs subsequently infected Alpha half likely pass unvaccinated are. areas Germany get vaccination brand choice within acceptable time?

There may regional exceptions vaccination centers either already finished waiting lists (including people without prioritization) within days finishing got mRNA appointment within days (though often Moderna Germans' first choice BioNTech). Many GPs company doctors difficulties finding patients want get vaccinated, already stopped vaccinating troublesome. 
With new recommendation always give mRNA second dose also bring 2nd dose forward (instead 12 week wait AZ+AZ) difficult get appointment center guess temporary like 1 2 weeks get easy again. Unfortunately, Germany great uptake e.g. Norway/Denmark/UK.  35 cases. saved click It’s LA cases increasing among unvaccinated. experiencing surge infections Delta variant, including among significant number fully vaccinated — represent 60% country — according India, healthcare workers fully vaccinated AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine — used U.S. — “showed evidence transmitting Delta variant others,” Ferrer [World Health Organization] Israeli government recommend known variant, individuals add layer protection wearing face masks,” added. True! Still, personally first moderna made weak. Also increased heart beat significantly 1-3 days. young healthy male adult 22 years old. scared second jab, lot male adults 16-24 get heart inflamation second shot. would take second jab, really afraid heart inflamation :(

Also mentioned case? Probably different area got different vaccine stocks? He's trying get AZ jabs family find anymore hospital area always told ran AZ. Another friend similar experience could find ones Sinovac areas. fair late registration got booked quick everytime booking slot opened.

 I'm glad could get AZ! far? downvoting comment pure bullshit. Take upvote. It’s high number unvaccinated aren’t afraid issue here. Yep. 


The people actually affected COVID never place conversation, coming going. isn’t relevant argument either side what’s best protect vulnerable, thought you’d intrigued know Abu Dhabi taken unique stance allowing anyone unvaccinated access public indoor spaces starting August 1. want go movies shopping mall, school, need get vaccine. They’re using science every country, they’ve reached completely different political decision. Especially higher cases leads greater evolutionary pressure create new variants. Pfizer adding lines almost every month capacity gradually increases. EU able deliver bit promised every week, wouldn’t crazy assume Australia also see better supply point. 

By end July expected Pfizer deliveries US EU drop doses available delivery countries point.

Moderna availability also radically improve coming months. got vaccinated AZ Indonesia literally yesterday. friends misinformed. 


You correct crowded vaccination sites however. highest risk since got hospital waiting certificate. queues seen outside fair. coworker keeps repeating masks anything.  feeling lot people brainwashed believing that. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yes, say that's end month. point pretty much adults wanted double vaxxed. then, would clever remain bit cautious. think issue opening things up. telling people things open, masks needed anymore, see people like - second dose seem important. Round 2! ….. FIGHT! Doctors give bad advice too. Many dont keep date newest practices  Science doesn’t say that. Science says order best protect vulnerable safest everybody keep wearing masks everywhere go indoors, regardless whether vaccinated not. Countries aren’t individualistic, vaccination rates higher US still mask mandates. aren’t using different science US using, different social policy. That's... odd me, pregnancy one higher risk situations covid forget flair vaccine status, Office Space flair tho....  took 9 weeks able get second shot, of... wait it... supply issues, second dose different vaccine first one.

I'm pretty sure shown longer duration wait original 3 weeks better anyways mixing matching vaccines shown work too. worked past others. Actually, mid August, every willing adult 2nd shot given 5-week interval used Netherlands. end month nearly 60% fully vaccinated, good place even compared western countries. Say got covid getting vaccine, vaccine center, would happen? Would go forward normal, would shot effect all? Probably not, additional cases Netherlands seem young people testing enter club festival. count regular testing still much stable level. Majority EU. Well vaccinated also catch virus. much much much lower chance.

But get vaccinated. Pfizer vaccine already 94% effective hospitalization first shot. think younger generation partially vaccinated gives enough protection reopen safely. 

I agree Dutch government could waited bit people vaccinated, necessarily every one fully vaccinated.

And restrictions, still restrictions place, huge capacity caps social venues social distancing everywhere (unless everyone tested vaccinated specific venue) Met Doctor yesterday. actual Medical doctor wont take vaccine. world fucked. they’re hahahahaha Appointments Netherlands wide open. Next day willing travel next week area. one wait weeks, unless call ask specifically later appointment slot. friends said AZ vaccines stock little sinovac moment that's got. good people willing get vaccinated everyday concerning see crowded vaccination sites. hate binary view. Yes, deaths hospitalisations obviously important metric saying cases rising matter bonkers. people trial? people made it?

Moderna trial participant here. vaccines weren’t even registered state system (California). no, don’t care. But, but, 5G? Well mean thing is, ENTIRE world got messed virus obviously there's SOMETHING worry lol new, unpredictable. Losing taste one symptom. There's bit more..... Last Christmas, saw Americans go home reunite families, said would rather infected virus stay families. helpless moved. 
I hope today, half year later, people bring vaccine instead virus families. really though. Humanity tough years yet come. matrix, agent Smith called Humans virus.

Guess mutate fast evade vaccine mother nature, looks like vaccine self-mutating well. Masks alone obviously enough. Japan's response lackluster surprising all. Anyone praising strategy idea they're talking about. almost non-existent.  Sige pare! widely reported (here abroad, live Indonesia) 300 health care workers got sick fully vaccinated, ""dozens"" hospitalized 5 died.

The reports left denominator: Indonesia vaccinated one million health care workers. So, 5 deaths 1,000,000 vaxxed. Leaving information great fear response, great clicks, fuel anti-vaxxers everywhere. Nice job, ""responsible"" media.

Local media currently playing games Delta, reporting become ""dominant variant"" without telling us percentage overall sequenced cases represents. One would assume high percentage, we'd information, since must known. common get side effects, rare get side effects bad deleted comment described. time, 'resident mask expert' among male friends, pointed 'the way actually make N95/FFP2 mask work shave' like 'what? Meh, can't bothered, like awesome beard' went back wearing surgical..... AZ yeah, Indonesia took could get credit, started vaccinating earlier area. 


The province Bali 50% vaccinated (first jab).  'couldn't establish quality' even bought masks directly reputable manufacturer like 3M? Pathetic. I'd slowly start looking new employer. like demand nurses there! Lots anti-vaxxers Philippines, though government (which bit, erm, forceful times) exerting lot pressure get vaccinated also. really know vaccinated people spread virus. known pre-symptomatic people contagious. could true asymptomatic vaccinated people.

The amount privilege straight entitlement incredible. never strict lockdown. sad life going bar makes go ""muh rights"". reset us early 2020.

I think sort word choice bad.

If variant comes along evades vaccines--and absolutely ""if"" when, glad said ""might""--it going send us back square one.

We well-established mRNA vaccine technology, Pfizer believes could design, test, get approved, produce 100 days. Countries infrastructure distribute vaccines rapidly, well.

Additionally, would probably warning, as--looking way variants gone far--it takes couple months variant take anyways seems likely new variant would chip away efficacy vaccines, drop zero.

This would terrible living poorer nations, though, resources would diverted make boosters wealthier nations. vaccinated believers science medicine bad guys sub. ""I'm fully vaccinated!"" flair become target folks around sadly. Australia, there’s limited availability vaccines. tendency variants likely become less virulent, more. evolutionary point view, beneficial kill host, make presence obvious isolate others. Evolution wants virus spread - nothing else. think CDC really jumped gun said vaccinated people go unmasked. miss characterization problem, trying stir anti American hate. Maybe country putt resources drug making, research, say don’t stop relying america blaming problems. USA making vax quickly possible donating 1b doses. Wonderful news. Germany share view guys engage anti-vaxx crowd instead, bue mitigation steps stay us:

Not sure second paragraph joke. Alter DNA, instead using trait humans developed millions years evolution? seem like knowledgeable person isn’t trying rationalize Republican talking points. Good. check lungs periodically. lot done active lifestyle, give up, easy corona create mental prison yourself.

Even cannot things, still many things do. even expensive. sorta... one weird thing tho: R0 riseen 2.5 original Alpha... 8 delta. Measles closer 20 

the effectiveness delta strain versus original dropped 94% 80% 2nd shot Moderna; mixing vaccines probably good guard worsening.

ultimately mutating likely go resident evil, really dodged bullet Pandemic. way Lol ok. Whatever need tell yourself. CNN front page headline: ""US falls short Biden's July 4th vaccine goal"".

Honestly cares. There's nothing magical 70% July 4th. 66.8% close enough. New cases, deaths, hospitalization March 2020 levels still falling. Outside HI cities/counties west coast, restrictions lifted. vaccinated, pretty much back normal despite daily media gloom doom. vaccinated, that's problem, WTF waiting for. say badass is? malarkey. Children died. variants continue mutate it’s entirely possible becomes dangerous kids. Living shirt tie jacket body clothing also normal means. accepted eventually. Saying “I don’t care” isn’t adding conversation, though. It’s epitome useless comment downvoted hidden. make fast want, high % people refuse get it, matter.  It’s sort ironic article states problem (at least locally) stemming low vaccination rate LA county’s minority population. 

The normal scapegoat grouping one certain kind people together blaming problem doesn’t stick it’s hilarious Yes however… variants.

If unvaccinated populations allow virus continue mutate may continue become dangerous kids. Okay see. article considers Oregon Colorado 70% rounding. adding chart. 128,000+ dead far UK LOT people. It’s important see whole picture cite single data point. dealing highly infectious virus, “low” mortality rates quickly add up. Try envision 128,000 dead bodies look like (we’re talking whole cities dead) grieving families look like. Correct. like force field around every cell body. someone coughs nice dose COVID face still infect plenty cells body recognizes immediately begins dispatching antibodies.

A vaccine could alter cells virus could enter *at all* would neat. assume would require pretty serious DNA editing alter expression cell wall receptors. purely political loser. also community transmission quite this, chance man coming contact unrelated person already infected another source next zero. [Base rate Except 18 states listed brought up. person asked 20 states Idk tell me. said need experts tell excess death.

And yes course someone expert fatality trends reporting. I'm willing bet yes public health professionals made careers around type data. Idk call experts. else would differentiate laypeople experience interpreting data? 

Of course makes sense you. That's great. Please post opinion understanding numbers. I'd also like hear actual experts. Well yea choose show work you’re uncomfortable around unvaccinated people probably terminated … go ways. live Covid vaccines treatments.  I've fight kids that's argument used. said mostly. Also kids much less likely die covid. antivaxxers gave shit kids would gotten vaccinated. could be. That's biases showing there. excess death Covid... even thing expert on?  Gotta call BS one. Absolutely proof caught virus. virus infectious, cloth mask would little confined areas due virus aerosolized going mask. yet study study showing masks help tremendously.

Like really, walk someone catch virus breathing normally nose (no water particles) exactly mask going scenario? Yeah know feeling, fully pfizerred UK sure friends 20/30s back home even get first dose, maybe October?

Was hoping visit September wedding, chance year think still think important get vaccine, nuance slipping cracks everyone seems think covid over. family friends pretty much back taking 0 precautions first shot. feel like we're much misinformed err side caution. That’s extremely well put , thank you

The people champion lockdowns lest affected lockdown itself. CCTV footage far conclusive evidence point transmission. kids aren’t risk serious Covid all? kids? Yeah! Fuck kids worldwide. don’t need them. article mentions this. included completeness. think 96% effective preventing serious illness hospitalization, 96% effective preventing infection.

Don’t let perfect enemy good. dont know, sounds like hating living lives…. shoudl say fear inducing? 70% 4th always first shot. They’ve saying since beginning Puerto Rico Guam aren’t states. Neither Washington DC matter read 3 times thinking tired missed said ones. fuck wrote that? eradicate it, since already endemic 

Vaccines could help eradicate people *do* want vaccine can’t get put another state panic

Who exactly referring chance? knowledge, thought virtually persons recommend get vaccinated. Thanks. suddenly OG virus can't easily survive, starts mutating stay alive.

That's works. seems like sarcasm me, hence emoji one many stories I've heard. generally end claimed vaccine, opposite Covid treated...

  \+28% article. FT good summary countries too, (I couln't find FT used summary get excess death calculated, e.g. depends demographic changes etc.) Covid endemic. stay. It’s unclear post, wife “dozens” others displaying symptoms tested confirmed positive COVID? One thing I’m noticing part country surge summer colds going around. Definitely COVID know several gotten tested confirmed negative, lots symptoms common COVID. guess fudging best cover failure reach widely proclaimed ""70% July 4th"" milestone put best face it.

I understand goal came from. 70% meaningful number epidemiological standpoint. assume thought would July 4th, bright spark idea casting stone goal. obviously backfired instead created perception program falling short.

If made ""50% July 4th,"" would [just work long term. Zero covid option 

It worked Eastern countries long time could work worldwide Western nations drop ball vast majority US hasn’t likely won’t see mask mandates again. I’m Virginia governor relaxed states point post? hating people going Vegas? like flu strains. need smear natural progression something dumb group look “The brainwashing dad.” Why? safe, effective. existed year would weird long term impacts, beyond immunity.  wore FFP3 mask whole flights Romania last year (from UK) reason. get either 2 3 quite easily know people get hold lack health service supply resolved. don’t need congressional testimony. history research quite well That's big claim make without evidence. 

Are kids even vaccinated, anywhere?  Good form.   Slow down, cowboy! There's still chance get it, and, do, chance could pass on. think life knew 2019 gone. think motivation make money, live capitalist society all. 

Yes, I'm sure vaccines would've made western governments given billions research. Would produced quickly, multiple teams many countries working simultaneously, cost current work? 

Maybe question 'Where's motivation produce vaccines quickly next time?' UK would high antibody rates without vaccine anyway due rampant Kent Delta variants. got second Moderna shot February 6th (Waitangi Day, Kiwi friends!). hopeful I’d able get back Australia 50th high school reunion end August. due totally shambolic vaccination response federal government, that’s going happen. 

My best friend GP Queensland frustrated position placed bureaucratic morass vaccination policy. unnecessary inefficient burden practice. vaccinated county health department drive clinic thousand shots day. walk clinic downtown football stadium ten thousand per day. 

Australia could done taken steps last year get onboard emergency authorization Pfizer Moderna vaccines. vaccines product decades international, publicly funded research researchers make pittance compared pharma execs. a, didn’t make first place, manufactured them

I 0 knowledge matter, quite possible 100% correct, would love hear forum involving people oath speak. Lets get knowledgeable people matter, including CEOs Moderna Pfizer front congress discuss this. SA's greedy politicians sold AZ stockpile African countries. Blood clots perfect cover make quick buck! Go lie pal I'm looking forward traveling summer craziness over, Vegas anywhere close list places want visit. I'd prefer experts confirm random dudes reddit saying instead declaring need random dudes reddit tell what's happening. That's ""we need experts say this."" worry still want opinion though, still get write comment excess deaths. Death negative outcome - ask long-haulers. What's process like States (at least are)? first dose, automatically given second dose appointment seek time? Well seems people knowledge area disagree you: 1. total, 66.2 percent respondents said thought would year less virus mutates enough first-generation vaccines 2. Eighteen percent said world two years 3. 7.8 percent respondents said mutations would never render current vaccines ineffective, another 7.8 percent said confident predicting 4. Eighty-three percent respondents said persistent low vaccine coverage many countries would make likely mutations occur.

I think issue describing antibodies produced vaccine looking spike general, whereas reality vaccines training body say ""look specific amino acid location 400 spike protein"". entire spike protein need altered make vaccine ineffective, specific proteins location antibodies looking for. think causes deaths?  Agreed. Cheers :) of, EU countries open US travellers now

I wonder much longer last Delta cases US rise. Isn’t UK EU shitlist due Delta numbers? Thanks auto mod, unvaccinated people possibly becoming infected gathering large groups fact based get. Let natural selection take make sure we're wasting heath care services them. I'm paying higher premiums dickheads. Anyways. That's exactly we've doing. AstraZeneca Johnson &amp; Johnson need deep Frozen. Funny there’s mention hundreds thousands unnecessary deaths. Huh. unvaccinated risk current evolution. risk though refuse vaccinate evolution accelerates. mRNA vaccines prevent asymptomatic infections like 80-90% cases (for original variant).

In jan-feb fear \*may\* prevent infections, got twisted people/media saying don't. new research showed fear unfounded. THANK  New Jersey underrated. Survival fittest doesn’t mean physically strong. same. know this. Thanks water wet comment. higher cases aren’t leading hospitalizations I’m sure restrictions needed. emphasis getting people vaccinated lack restrictions likely motivate holdouts get shot. Predicting people might suffer actions wishing people suffer thing. useful countries little supply vaccine AZ/Oxford. Go look vaccines covax administered. 


How South Africa's fight covid going, decision idiotic lead deaths countless south africans needlessly. Compare latter waves terms deaths UK Oxford vaccine extensively used delta variant. Hint dying UK. 


People banging efficacy good stopping death hospitalisation leading sub-optimal outcomes people waiting 'better vaccine' dying interim, lead preventable deaths needs pushed back on. 


Efficacy important thing. Genuine question. chance getting long covid, breakthrough infection, full vaccination?  put below, we're 2 doses 8 week gap. Genuine question. chance getting long covid, breakthrough infection, full vaccination? think around 30 percent over-50s, 40-50 percent youngest groups [who vaccinated]. able vaccinate half under-45s,  People taking consideration, messy calculate.  


As describe, know exact number, know (let's say) 15% split vaccinated / non-vaccinated: could 50:50, could 20:80. we'd add anywhere 0-15% number.  
But immune response actual (especially mild) infection lot less predictable immune response vaccination, might weaken earlier. 'useful' number lower.

So: infections probably help herd immunity point, difficult pin down, doubt probably helps conservative estimates. wonder fast elementary schools, full over-crowded classrooms unvaccinated kids, open back full capacity anyways fall.  wife (38) experienced dry cough, fatigue, sore throat, light-headed loss smell. almost back normal, still little fatigued smell isn’t back. Symptoms lasted 7 days, first three days mild point didn’t even think sick.

My mother (58) experienced fever, cough, sore throat, fatigue. symptoms came suddenly - course couple hours. day 2 symptoms. Got big list viruses picked HIV/AIDS ability stick immune system, ya? count hilariously low. HIV/AIDS playing role selfish magician never share secrets. absolutely credible reason believe Covid variant ever change spike protein (you know, part virus vaccine targets) enough evade vaccine retaining ability infect human cells. half suspect group people always like this. sort stubborn gene. stat people get shot die?  Imaging privileged shit thousands still dying every day globally want vaccine, option, still turn down.

I stayed inside much possible, wore mask everywhere went, took precautions possible. Now, everyone friend group vaccinated. part, pandemic us. someone access vaccine still wants roll dice, I'm done worrying stupidity.   Well unvaccinated people aren’t taking don’t see downside guess.

I live Canada insurance premiums generally thing universal healthcare.

Raise auto insurance suppose. never understood take. Tens thousands die every year flu one cares. close 50 people die pulse shooting world mourns. wrong people reacted passionately pulse whoever died flu year people died that? People always reacted tragic events due violence despite people dying things. strange people reacted 9/11 people dying illness. Illnesses never illicit reaction outrage ending life violence does. unvaxxed people eventually gain immunity infected. overwhelming majority won’t require hospitalization get long covid. See! hate New Jersey don’t high vaccination percentage 😤😤 you’re states 1-6 list bully wish  both.

In late May early June went three weeks sure reinfection new infection either B.1.1.7 Delta (we three known cases area time) simultaneously laughing singing videos internet terrified. unpredictability,

In retrospect think could even relapse (long covid) caused go ER serious shortness breath. Really? I’m seeing Washington state 61%. getting info wrong place? United States 99% deaths unvaccinated. don’t feel bad people don’t get vaccinated can. absolutely need go back normal even though still degree risk. don’t risk life go back all. Story old time.  mean yeah descendants would either meet fate eventually change.


Also apparently COVID-19 causes testicle damage, ouch. Glaveston? savage  Offer workers $1000 bonus get damn thing.. money motivate dumb.  Almost like Darwin's natural selection thing?

The really bad variants actually put lot selection pressure preventing wants (reproduce) - fair amount people got either died, passed on, survived.

Now vaccinations thing even pressure put viruses either mutate live, spread others, die. wish people, sadly amount people mistrust vaccine conspiracy theorists Republican voters higher one would think. anecdotal, another forum in, asked people going get vaccine lot replied no, saying vaccine rushed distrusted it. people Republicans, knowledge, anti-vax all. remember people monolith groups people monoliths either. convince hesitant anti-vax conspirators? know, sadly. that's 2nd dose moderna effective 21% people  state list, yet 46% people county fully vaccinated. Population density skews overall numbers quite bit. obviously true. bad virus leave immune person alive. infected, gain immunity therefore useless virus taking resources. And, since we're social animals, bunch immune people makes harder virus locate new victims. would much better virus kill far people scare others making new replacement people virus could infect. course exaggerating purposefully ridiculous, see point makes much sense ""the virus kill nobody somehow benefits it."" scenario works somehow virus picks HIV/AIDS trick sticking immune system, won't; nothing going randomly gain ability.  Let la county know pls power

or

that thing 120 kids got galveston days ago.... bad denomination..... Pre-pandemic, Chinese citizens could two kids. three kids! Freedom!! Keep fear going. make smoking alcohol illegal, better country citizens. imagine reduced lung cancer, second hand smoke, drunk driving. great would suck? may mean survive instead dying.

Let’s hope right. need oral drugs stop disease spread. Vaccine never it. Correct. largely able mutate, genetic code error-correcting well fact that, did, would lose ability infect humans altogether. symptoms experiencing?  Can't make government-mandated vaccines get full FDA approval. whatever. lost cause, like ""literally"" turning ""figuratively"". activities limited least. concerts, big events, pay higher insurance premiums. They're get Scott free making decision. There's nuance feel needs taken account here: infectious dose on-off switch, probabilities. viral particles take in, larger chance makes past normal immune system infects cells. 

For example, estimates original SARS infectious dose almost everyone would become infected around 1,000 viral particles. However, level 50% would become infected around 250 viral particles. Technically, 1 particle could theory infect someone (though would extremely unlikely). 

It's possible person incredibly unlucky got infected dose would almost never cause infection. Yeah, absolute failure government again, seemingly endless list failures. LNP even bother pretending competent anymore.  true. Plenty people going leave without vaccination. need follow host country quarantine rules provide negative tests airlines. Interesting chart--just wish blues same. Shows way go--a necessary reminder. mask recommendations mandates coming back US fully vaccinated people frankly exhausting. wonder actually realized people biggest violators weren’t following mandates place last year, reason believe would now? cherry-picking data.

No, read whole thing I'm challenging tell whether protecting people anything might spread ever crossed mind pandemic happened saw good stepping stone debates continuing mitigation post-vaccine likely never going eradicated period. either get vaccinated eventually get infected. People going pick one. Maybe next six months definitely next years, widespread enough impossible think disappear one day. recall ""it's flu"" ""fatality rate 1%""?

Hell even spun reactionary anti-lockdown subreddit raids one day...

COVID precautions always divisive asked us put public goods private interested individualist country money buy. Yeah, people vaccinated far strict priority system. part high priority group, choice Astrazeneca. wish visualizations showcase exponential growth absolutely right people can't grasp wish could see anything grows exponentially becomes highly dangerous volatile little time .

[The rice chessboard husband high hope country comes pandemic. thinks things get pretty bad months time. everything get us Pfizer vaccine became available here. huge load shoulder got first dose. guys SG waay better comes dealing virus. Maybe should? Flu deaths would go way down. don’t understand it’s bad wear mask public indoors space. really cumbersome you? believe beneficial? cousin ""health ambassador"" mega-store. counted people employee screenings. Corporate team came ""corporate business"" screenings. One woman's response tells drag longer needs to.

Cousin: least one dose covid vaccine?

Corporate gal: No. course not. hope didn't.

Cousin: (Learned ignore customer's crazy responses interested women's reasoning) that?

Corporate gal: ""They"" intentionally giving covid vaccinated.  Look statistics. Statistics lie. vaccinated getting now. ones hospitalized covid vaccinated. ""They"" infecting people make people get vaccinated.""

Corporate gal could easily believe someone somehow giving covid unvaccinated people unknown purpose could believe vaccine works. 70% shots given Germany BioNTech, 15% AstraZeneca. Obviously it’s simple oversight understandable, it’s quite obvious opinion. always flabbergasted saw full beard masked lol, like, gonna close up? 😅 sizable amount people, pandemic never taking actions greater good, it’s adhering sensibilities becoming controllable. Vaccines readily available good efficacy yet still expected comply.. makes wonder doesn’t it? California likely much natural + vaccine immunity UK. We'll see. idea downvoted. Here’s cookie. Wow thats pretty amazing, got second dose 2 weeks exactly first dosage. playing around missing second dose. wonder could improtant miss second dose. mean really correct? idea virus isn’t selectively pressured immune system doesn’t seem right me, otherwise implication viruses wouldn’t otherwise mutate without vaccines then.

Or something missing equation ? Gotta go vote today.Maybe 30% immunity,It's little Delta.I go full protection.(with goggles.I care looked at) Still surprised much 65-74 exceeds 75+ People wear masks occasionally, obvious symptoms sick. single country everytime people go indoors public covering faces, nonsense. large group people part end pandemic.

We asked people stay home. didn't.

Fine, wear mask go out. didn't.

Fine, get vaccine go want ditch mask. still getting vaccine (and wearing masks either). also totally cool fact lick cold 1.5 years problem ""a months"" ""a weeks"" there's clear endpoint. There's always going variants spread, virus endemic likely continue spread infinitely. There's never going perfect time people resume normal lives. 

The people need take special precautions needing take special precautions prior pandemic need take special precautions long gone. Preaching choir.

I’m interested see full results vaccine Delta variant. stands now, 2 4 vaccinated people exposed kids, tested positive symptomatic.

My dad fine, far.

I’ve two bedroom apartment three unmasked Covid positive people last 5 days. It’s been…. Fun. live new city staying apartment house built - else go, I’m swimming it. 🤣😂🤣 8 weeks (unless getting Moderna glacial supply means 11 weeks practice.) really understand articles like author seems touch reality field. rich Western countries gobbling available vaccine honestly think poorer countries like Indonesia choice kind vaccine get? Yes, vaccines 100%. Thats every single trial result stuff like ""94%"", ""90%"" etc result. 100%. 

Thats whole reason herd immnity important nobody ever 100% safe unless everybody takes part. grouping people aren’t hysterical covid anti everything crew. 

I’m responding comment. 

Covid end. year , two three. never wear mask long “win” . running variants entire life , long disease shadow current self . 

We people fully vaccinated highly effective drugs afraid variant CDC says vaccine protects against… holding end that’s coming Nice, would make sense put something one Phase 2/3 trial volunteers display, instead honoring first person got vaccine 40k people proofed safe? post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

There’s lot people , I’d argue most, exercise proper precautions, take pandemic seriously yet continue use reasonable common sense ..

All respond question happens completely arbitrary time first year . .. answer clear, pick something else afraid of.. 

There isn’t golden finish line pandemic. People literally chasing rainbows. Learn deal , means wearing mask I’d support comparison, current rate 850,000 vaccinations per week Australia. mix AZ Pfizer. 

So arrival 600,000 Pfizer per week (sometime) sounds like vaccination numbers stay even drop given AZ stop used next months.

Also, given 4 stage opening ""plan"", 600,000 doses per week Australia opening anytime soon. time 2022 rough calculation estimate.

Hopefully Pfizer (or Moderna) doses sourced. could see push back LA, areas late go back lockdowns restrictions. think people can6t views? Vaccinations masking prevent varriants get community spread low. happens unvaccinated finally mutate strain vaccines work against? 

That's selective pressure works. vaccinated people mutate vaccine-resistant strain. Vaccines way out. billions dollars research went gave us way out. close. people decided need get vaccinated. 

We thankful parents vaccinated us smallpox polio.   know ""high-income"" country (surely feel way), far remember simply enough supply Pfizer/Moderna vaccines buy, since USA, Europe, etc got supply... bought readily available, Sinovac, saved many lives.
Cases hospitalizations steadily decreasing Chile, Delta variant arrived recently here, though. There's talk third dose vaccinated back january/february, goverment still decided vaccine they're going use that.
There's lot trash talk Sinovac vaccine, truth working intended, preventing mostly hospitalization death. city completed 100% adult population 1 shot, 80% complete vaccination, cases gone noticeabily. 
If get enough supply mRNA vaccines everyone Chile, would awesome, meantime Sinovac fine. factors make so? think biggest difference people spend time outside summer, huge covid airborne. Consequences never same. got first dose. caused much inflammation floored pain. herniated disk needed surgery within month. I've recovered surgery enough whole body inflammation. can't make get second shot body calms down. 
I also covid. that, too. 

Some people advised doctors get 1 dose. 
My doctor actually get all.  live, walk certified covid vaccine administration area (could tents parking lot run local hospital, local pharmacy, etc). don’t need form authentication registration. ask vaccine, say “Right left arm” go card says return next dose.   Effectively zero. significant side effects would seen now. idea side effects popping years afterwards unfounded doesn’t really happen vaccine world.  always been. care anymore since mine vaxxed never million years understand ordinances enforced height thing. time government happy enough hand ticket, money grab. anti-maskers hands off. Can't dare upset delicate little flowers. Hey Covid deniers - please go smoke pot public places would set precedence enforce law well. “People vaccinated end hospital possibly die.”

Well that’s quite optimistic perspectives.  I'm assuming means one must comment get flair way call student graduates last class medical school?

its bad;

u got vaccines enjoy yourself! effectiveness apparently increases time testing far... According russian buddy, Russians trust russian vaccines, therefore get vaccinated available there. don’t know I’m still alive I’ve wearing work whole time. don’t understand someone think look around see people still alive. Just, how? Yes, turns medical professionals morons Becoming doctor means pass exams. mean infallible right kind person doctor. Many doctors lose licenses due malpractice unprofessional behaviour. lose licenses forever barred giving anyone medical advice whatsoever. ....and died Covid.................................................................... science stated multiple times vaccinated, safe. 

Science also ""stated"" (whatever means) variants develop spread unvaccinated people, development variants reduces effectiveness existing vaccines. 

So every-man-for-himself kind situation like making be--the actions unvaccinated actually impact everyone, vaccinated not. last steps tested rigorously proven safe... tho....

to deny science charlatanism vaccine give full immunity. world you? Everytime someone mentions masks accessory that’s always peoples faces Asian countries, remember long trips places fact people fact wearing them, even subway particularly crowded. I’m talking Japan, Korea, China, Hong Kong well SEA countries. people chose wear them, doesn’t mean everyone was. will. many places fully vaccinated negligible. 

But places vaccine numbers low, totally non-coincidentally July 4th fervour high, things could get nasty. western countries, might know rampant influence CCP South East Asia countries, elder generation prefer China vaccines thought vaccines produced using traditional methods safer

Me trying avoid vaccine took AZ, leaves possibilities heterogeneous vaccination later Hate break lot medical professionals refused vaccine. Yeah, 88% symptomatic infection. Pretty damn sweet, nowhere near 95% infection daughter one SF refuses get vaccine. anti-vaccine fact would say people get it. Including parents siblings. But, healthcare seen enough data vaccine effect pregnancy medical conditions satisfy her….enough get shot. healthy believes protected eating plant-based diet, taking supplements. follows CDC federally mandated mask wearing protocols. Since SF good shape covid wise feels pretty comfortable there. travels dates generally living life usual. plans come East holiday vaccinated concerned much us, curious handle casual interactions like visiting friends, going movies, dine her? doesn’t believe others ask others vaccinated, HIPPA. Nobody stopping people making choice. choosing get vaccinated opting face travel restrictions imposed countries. don’t travel. choosing get vaccinated choosing face potential termination employers require vaccination. don’t know country you’re US employment country, employers *choose* require that. Nobody forcing work company, choose work employer doesn’t requirement I’m sure many.

So what’s false narrative somebody preventing anybody making choice? source hand IIRC Pfizer like 88% delta variant   Source Pfizer 95% effective Delta infection? Sounds way high. Sorry, even close holocaust comparison. dare you. importantly, vaccinated people way less likely spread someone else. really care less 'personal choice' choice involves risking lives people say matter. worried, get vaccinated wear mask. science stated multiple times vaccinated, safe. even safe wearing mask, staying home socially distancing. don’t think necessary, again, worried, take care you.

And God know many unnecessary infections caused. article primilariy focuses fancy high-end shops restaurants. author would find disparity going Walmart Target lower income neighborhood without class markers.

The narrow focus slant laughable. kids get yet

I discussed previous risk children low, virtually inconsequential (this good thing). Yes, every death many, far safest demographic terms hospitalizations can't get due medical conditions

According CDC, ""COVID-19 vaccines recommended administered people underlying medical conditions"" mind specifying exactly medical conditions referring to, would beneficial already discussed another previous chances allergic COVID-19 vaccine (or vaccine matter) 0.0006%. put perspective, slightly higher chance struck lightning countries (outside US), everyone access yet

Understood, currently reside US, knowledgeable data here. cannot say speak countries' vaccine rollout, government structure, conditions affect vaccine rollout, etc. Total malarkey really is. downtown Chicago months staying burbs. Going common sense people wearing masks outside basically running away staggering. Got studies back up? I've heard thing. gonna awesome unvaxxed die.  wonder % unvaccinated people already virus? 
Death rate 3% 
Number dead 600k  
Total infected 20million Pretty sure Gottlieb said something similar well. It’s gonna pretty much completely different virus evades mRNA vaccines completely. virus mutates natural immunity gets weaker time. going true vaccine well, I've gleamed natural immunity weaker vaccination, that's issues pop first. know people get hold lack health service supply resolved.

Governments paranoid creating another PPE shortage want recommend perhaps loosely fitting surgical-style masks quite effective proper FFP3 masks. Nope. People say time group.

Only reason can't vaccinated allergic something vaccine itself. allergic vaccine get another one. one extremely rare people allergic both, still find another way vaccinate, monitored getting vaccine (Search ""Do vaccinate"") state 30% vaccinated

wtf. That's lower almost countries Europe, we've really begun mass vaccinating people 50 last 4-6 weeks due massive supply issues AstraZeneca... Expect smoke fires exist lol, true. Australia. isn’t enough vaccine meet demand there. Im scratching head wondering makes privileged shit? choice get don't, that's them. privileged? vaccinated 3 times reaches 2000+ u/ml proud vaccinated 3 times reaches 2000+!u/ml proud Yes, drove Vancouver Monroe get first shot April.

Amazing! We've booked get married Neon Graveyard. We've got everything crossed go!  balanced article goes detail means next steps may need part vaccination drive. 

I suspect headline may taken different ways depending country affected Delta variant vaccine drive moment. “uHHH 1%!!!!!!” lines studies. want know happens *with* vaccine.  certainly looks like first boosters Pfizer truly cannot vaccinated - also large swath population (ex: pregnant women) recently told vaccinated birth many OBs still providing guidance. 

Sincerely - pregnant lady told wait delivery vaccinated. Let clear, expert. 

With said, heard TV-expertrs read topic appears difficult, though impossible grant vaccine resistant variant emerge. 

Immunology complicated way head, percentage number hear part equation, parts human immune system apparently much harder escape.

At end day story virus told 3-4 years immediate crisis ended.

Edited correct spelling grammar seem like Americans. government needs start going door door holding every man, woman child giving shot whether want not. Babies, pregnant women, matter. Everyone must conform even turn military citizens. like put special quarentine camps.

This true. CDC recommended individuals weakened immune systems may get vaccinated data safety COVID-19 vaccines immunocompromised people yet available great study published Journal American Medical Association (JAMA) already discussed previous shows COVID vaccine provide least protection (47% second dose) individuals received organ transplant (i.e. 12

First, hospitalization rate adolescents aged 12-17 stands cumulative rate 0.058%, peaked 0.002% January 2021, currently 0.0002% June 26, 2021 ([CDC also published CDC, found associated deaths among adolescents aged 12-17 January 2020-March 2021.

These numbers extremely low already even without COVID-19 vaccine, Moderna found 100% effective among children aged 12-17 regards children aged younger 12, risk hospitalization death even lower.

The hospitalization rate children aged 0-4 stands cumulative 0.06%, peaked 0.002% December 2020, currently 0.0002% June 26, 2021 ([CDC hospitalization rate children aged 5-11 stands cumulative 0.02%, peaked 0.0008% January 2021, currently 0.0003% June 26, 2021 ([CDC averages, hospitalization rate children aged 0-11 stands cumulative 0.04%, peaked 0.0014% December 2020/January 2021, currently 0.00025% June 26, 2021.

The death rate children aged 0-4 stands cumulative 0.00034%, death rate children aged 5-14 stands cumulative 0.00016%. Combining averages, death rate children aged 0-14 stands cumulative 0.00025% numbers extraordinarily low. course, one death many, present life death thing among children think irrational best, fearmongering worst. 

To summarize, immunocompromised persons may get COVID-19 vaccine according CDC clear data COVID-19 vaccines safe immunocompromised persons (except study provided shows provides protection). children aged 0-14 safest demographic involving hospitalizations deaths. safe, fact, chances less 0.1% hospitalizations deaths, figures even less 0.001%. variable Delta variant, Russia midst battling variant made appearance US. 

US needs get vaccinations although antivaxxers imagine that’s like screaming wind point. OK Yup agree. wife known antivaxxers constantly complain masks. feel like I’m one that’s upset it. asked first Go on. Explain logic. Show maths got conclusion.  Vaccine’s distributed Leftorium. terribly difficult someone like affected schadenfreude. want healthcare resources taken anyone needlessly someone love may need them. there's always little bit thinking serves right. fair, lot places already hit super hard add got COVID + vaccinated COVID, much higher # That's virus works though. concentrates places least vaccination. good places pretty good vaccination rates, ones really low rates going hit hard future. friend’s DOCTOR told vaccines “political ploy”. First thing said told was, “Did get new doctor?” ""If fire starts, fire department come put free! little suspicious?""   die get infected, less effective current vaccinations become Haha, try change subject ASAP. least 4 million dead think many empty chairs mean family gatherings.

But yeah, like said also need mass vacination center vacinate 1.4% population per day, like Canada ATM.

How healthcare vacination split state fed Australia? Canada, fed responsible buy province distribution. Every state going get eventually, choice needle live virus. map available?     catalyst made changed minds? Well yeah say anything public health measures, yeah cars necessary society. people talking taking kids fun stuff covid fear, drive kids anyways, greater risk covid. number unvaccinated deaths equivalent efficacy vaccine. efficacy vaccine effective vaccine works preventing catching virus. number people who've caught virus died completely unvaccinated totally different thing....Sigh. He's saying 40% people US states say refuse vaccine, large enough unvaccinated percentage endanger people unable get shots yet (IE compromised immune systems children) say typed load see makes sense you. Nah. actually talking study
That said 50 vaccinated people died cited Public Health England. Anti covid vax websites citing    That's mean.

Plus go Walgreens, load garbage bag stuff walk out. 


Pffff, pizza party  ...but that's pharma companies EU states trying profit pandemic instead sharing vaccine IP manufacturing details? beginning pandemic, several initiatives make vaccine technologies open equitably available everyone. quashed western governments, NGOs, pharma companies. want see breakdown percentage vaccinated vs. money spent towards vaccination state per capita basis. would interesting see taking money get people vaccinate. abysmal

I often wonder ""normal"" situation. trying immunize huge national populations scratch (350 million US, 65 million UK, e.g.) gotten half six months. amazing accomplishment, really lame? I'm familiar similar situations history.

I know movies invent vaccine last five minutes, there's quick happy ending. really goes?

Honestly wondering.  problem perfect environment breed vaccine resistant mutation. oh yeah cause fauci ain’t full shit lmao   Good you. us families get see *ETA: assuming mobile*

This seems critical. Finally mobile find way browser interface.

Thanks! 99% huh. guess counting nurse got first vaccination.   Lol true! It’s funny people dead neck still listen intently! Darwinism action weekly release numbers instead daily feel cause less attention what's going here.

Everything increased last week hits news cycle week now. Chile planning using Pfizer third booster shot people Sinovac. doses already bought next months planes arriving Chile mostly Pfizer less Sinovac, president said country going transition mRNA vaccines booster shots doses available. They’re waiting studies indicate inactivated virus mixed mRNA effective enough it’s worth. cases steadily going Chile, almost 70% country two doses (Sinovac not) vaccines definitely working. Delta could fuck everything though it’s looking good. Oh no. Anyway  N95 respirators available ever. remain reasonable choice fully vaccinated person chooses contribute spread immunity escaping SARS-CoV2 variants community, high-risk potentially vulnerable unvaccinated friends family. Particularly situations might exposed large numbers unmasked likely unvaccinated strangers enclosed spaces, responsible compassionate choice.

If grandma passes Covid, going got me. deal minor inconvenience without whining it. Peer pressure going change mind. someday I'll proud behaved it, carrying baggage unintended consequences self indulgence. 

But you. Literally never history vaccine effects didn’t show within weeks. NEVER. passes body within days that’s that. avoid every pill, drug, food think it’ll magically hurt years now? makes sense. Billions taken vaccines completely fine. fears 100% irrational. Thanks - 21% chance infection vs. 12% pretty important correction, especially ""mild"" infection good chance damaging organs.

I'm frustrated focus death rates since start pandemic, recovered statistics including even people severe long term health consequences. 

It's like looking old photo ward polio victims iron lungs saying ""looks good, they're recovered."" Yep. They’re problem anymore. It’s choice.

I refuse cater accommodate unvaccinated people refuse it. I’m going back lockdown wearing mask them.   is. know someone currently ICU ventilator it’s looking good, refused get vaccine. Im sad situation don’t want anything bad happen her, time entirely preventable Wait, it’s illegal smoke outside England? Cigs mean? x meters away building whatever? great point 1% still shit ton people. Commenting comment see it'll work! infected person conversation feet away, takes minutes aerosols directed breathing time. 🙄🥱 Fauci never got his. Well shit. lot died vaccine made.  comments sick  help mutate I've tried. I've convinced many people get shot someone vaccine hesitant first. matter much evidence piles feet.

anyone getting point beyond hope (assuming medical) confirm…..lots idiots home province Saskatchewan, Canada. think best explanation kind transmission always happened, [this points out; examples previous outbreaks short duration exposure led infections, Berala BWS cluster New South Wales, people going bottle shop short period time becoming infected almost certainly aerosol transmission. There’s nothing different terms virus transmitted Melbourne right now.”  dad won’t get yet. family Jamaican, Jamaicans general skeptical things, especially stuff like this. dont agree him, rest family done already. He’s ugly it, doesnt criticize us say shouldn’t even wont. brother cautious people weird way. I’m probably going tell cant visit awhile Delta variant going around, unfortunately. I’m spooked good reason. wont get angry take personally. bring shot get free, says thanks leaves that. 

He’s somewhat Rastafarian, guess? He’s vegetarian healthy, active man 50s, hes micro-nutrients knowing benefits various vegetables supplements. replacement shot anyway, thats give idea is. Unfortunately, family left Jamaica bad circumstances hes distrustful government general, especially pertains medicine trials black people (see Tuskegee experiments)—i think worries black ppl underrepresented trials, way women :/ 

He’s kind man. Covid, person took care old woman he’d helping years. kids wouldnt take appointments, put horrible home never checked her. visited regularly said smelled like urine depressing. kids also threw nice things curb took passed along family felt sad see things trashed. died, her, literally bed rested next gave ice chips. tore up. loved much gave minivan went home. 

I share he’s actually kind thoughtful person. dont agree issue vaccines, never Covid-denier didnt take seriously downplayed it. still wears mask everywhere never acts like ridiculous over-hyped. double layer cloth mask filter, lot. N95 mask, lot. situation, infected person one wearing mask, would keep aerosolized particles spreading much. guarantee, mask could've done lot. cases day Australia, there's much reason mandate masks.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I'm actually surprised person infect people infectious.  99 percent Covid victims Trump voters fearful shot one reason another. respond somebody talking UK thread UK considered evolution acting deniers well virus? what's problem AZ?    example... homeowners policy got rewritten . last year State Farm clause cover earthquake damage caused fracking. unless talk % people die getting covid, never happen honestly considering harsh american medical system, least dumb expense. honestly considering harsh American medical system, least dumb expense.

I wonder see insurance providers charging premiums non vaccinated, people excuse, right providing service? gay wedding cake relation this, republicans want business able choose customers. , could. American spoiled. Long Covid known happen even people mild illness, though. 

That's main concern people (including myself) share moment - there's data whether mild post-vaccination infection result long-term effects way mild unvaccinated infection can.  going time ICUs also. Lisbon ICUs 90% assigned limit

Not believe you, can't find anywhere. guarantee even 100% vaccinated safe raging cases among young.

It unlikely vaccinated individual get covid. very, unlikely vaccinated person get hospitalized die covid. Even Delta variant. better take delta back home you.

What talking about? US already Delta variant. become dominant variant within weeks even nobody comes country. Additionally, double vaccinated low chance carrying it. Further, need take test come back states.  reasonable assumption test 200_000 people find positive. also bad statistics count positive negative. makes number worthless. Exactly thinking. They’ll die result COVID later on. I’m caring people failing chronic lung function flaring immune diseases killing months later. didn’t kill month virus actively, destroying bodies slowly killing later on. say goodbye one favorite patients fought last breath dying words “I want death mean something. Make sure good comes death.”

I’ll miss ya Bill. Yes, 1/100 die also vaccinated. Every death, 99/100, people decided vaccinate. Considering insurance paying covid shots would say never. It’s almost like thee around million deaths vaccine out? ugly ass graphics card... omg one percent virus death ones got vaccinated. vaccines dangerous hoax 🗿 I'm curious many 99% vaccine even available. stats that? Thank you! Honestly probably top 100. lucked Covid doesn’t effect children much, many diseases terrible children past.   know…..it does. yeah, guy, need take chill pill, invested instead.  them? forget goshdarn Jewish space lasers. Jews making money extinguishers building supplies. 

/s J&amp;J prime mRNA booster 12+ weeks probably really, really effective. probably even effective wait longer get next generation delta/beta-targeted boosters.

Sadly done direct research this, 12 week gap appears comparable J&amp;J's crafted spike seems give better antibody breadth vaccine (it's drop-off beta/delta lowest) likely even better. I’m okay it. I’ve spent 16 months begging, arguing, screaming anti vax right thing it’s like talking stupid brick wall. 

If want sacrifice children statistics study respond pandemic, let it. They’re worth empathy anymore.   I'm guessing, feel free continue pounding ass downvotes, Moderna Pfizer would something say ""simply manufacturing"" stuff. Everything running trials, logistics, risk management, etc. I'm full supporter socialized medicine, forgive simply take word little value added global effort.

I hope misunderstand statement. know grants work, mom works one lab. ""could"" - click more! Look bright side. downvote twice.   That’s wear KN95s. They’re pretty cheap buy.

EDIT: also wearing mask provide 0 protection yourself, really care protecting need KN95 similar. Believe life revolve around reddit like I'm assuming does.

400 people day test positive despite vaccines UK. wrong. dead ones  all. Honestly funniest part unvaccinated literally don’t give crap all. people still worried people who’s gotten vaccinated. Literally entire sub people vaccinated complaining aren’t. people aren’t could care less lol. longer feel bad people vaccinated NEVER felt bad.  feel bad people cant get vaccine due health reasons, though. mom got hers, first Moderna shot went anaphylactic shock monitored 48 hrs. also irregular heart rhythm high d-dimer w/e indicating clotting risks. still got second monitored precaution. 

And ppl pregnant unsure, understand, well others organ transplants immuno-suppressants. 

All reason get shot, actual herd immunity protect ones can’t. read virus takes refuge brain reproductive organs? correct, amazing! shows us like mutations covid far less immune escape ability E484K. means E484K+x+x mutations concerning vaccines. really nice Yeah, thought definitely overblown back February early March. data started really becoming available though, especially saw happening Italy, changed tune real quick. also thought masks ridiculous idea, read data. DONT understand people made judgment severe virus beginning, just... stuck judgment year empirical evidence clearly showed false. girlfriend still refuses get vaccine. kinda legitimate reason, severe psoriasis got control dermatologist told vaccines really high chance causing severe breakout really.dont know covid vax would affect psoriasis. bad close year, looked like hands dipped acid. sleep, lot trouble working. inconvenience. risk causing severe flare-up seem worth her. understand that, saw grandparents nearly die covid. im still trying convince benefits outweigh risk, avail. read virus takes refuge brain reproductive organs?  brought numbers show bipartisan divide vaccinations. overwhelming majority Democrats say they’ve vaccinated, **only 45% Republicans vaccinated 38% Republicans say won’t get vaccine**, according O’Keefe

That's bipartisan divide. That's party divided itself. talking people act like whole thing sort political agenda. totally misinterpreting results. Absolutely one seriously thinks vaccines actually stop getting covid. look number people vaccinated still test positive day UK
  unvaccinated peeps know recently got Covid it’s glorious.. made political  It’s 100% endemic US. re-introduced. millions exaggerated good get sick, fact (thankfully) COVID harmful kids remained consistent. adopt restrictions protect kids -- justification shutting schools masking protect teachers parents kids might bring home to.

Now adults are, least be, protected, goalposts shifting idea somehow good kids, thought necessary mask diseases affect similarly worse.

I think eligible kids encouraged get COVID vaccine, reason encourage people get flu vaccine. worries goalposts shifting toward idea can't go back unless achieve herd immunity vaccinating children, nobody (even China) wants mandate vaccinations, without it, we'll never get enough coverage. mean, even completely ignoring basic idioticness statement, one two ""class citizens"" ""repressed"", choice. measles isn’t eliminated, small outbreaks keep popping every then.  Here. reading That’s stupid. COVID flu. Give one good reason COVID can’t eliminated US. eliminated Measles Measles *seriously* much infectious.

I call BS assertion.  want know: reading, evidence imminent emergence new variant renders current vaccines ineffective? WAY 😂😂 shit, good thing theyre hurting themselves, mostly vaccine get? couldnt change also make harder spike protein bind receptor? Delta binds good receptor, could new different variant really bind much better? another example way scare everyone take vaccine I'm professor. ignorant medical science desire teach you. That's kind point. many ""Christians"" actually follow Golden Rule Jesus' actual teachings? religions.  moving real solution. could never achieve 0 covid even 100 years, move treat like flu.  Spoiler. snake actually Loki waiting stab you. patients waiting room clapped mRNA part cell biology. cells make tRNA DNA gets turned mRNA goes ribosomes. mRNA half-life like 8 minutes.

The vaccines stripped spike protein coded mRNA. short effective life need fancy nanilioid balls cold temperatures.

Other extra ingredients vaccine, none unusual new nanolipid, still lipids end day, body constantly breaking mRNA. little chance anything even cause long term issue. like saying unsure single fast food meal long term health. 

The spike protein seems cause side effects apparently human bodies really react well them.  Right here. still praise now? need quicken pace vaccination that's gone well (partly population turning AZ little risk infection entire pandemic, people would rather wait mRNA now...contrast UK people like ""nope last year sucked balls, I'm getting AZ anything jab with"". friend literally turned AZ months ago exactly zero cases state got Pfizer) getting control current leak. that, they've nearly unscathed pandemic rest world could barely dream last 15 mos. don’t trust Chinese one, trust Russian one 100%. People COVID multiple times.      dying problem here? Loss taste smell fucked thing decide it’s OK inflict kids you’re damn inconvenienced wearing mask. Can’t slap N95s kid don’t fit. Vaccine passports, mandatory vaccinations, protective gear solutions unvaccinated morons hide behind dropped mask mandates.

^([ | )[^(Opt | )[^(Opt | ] Downvote remove | v1.5) heard countries disrecommending younger people. According UK offer 30s alternative vaccines.[38] reasoning 20-29 age range benefits individual vaccination less likelihood harm COVID-19 less closer potential risk harm vaccine (at medium exposure risk COVID-19 infection cases running rate 60 per 100,000).[39][38] higher age groups benefit risk ratio increased.[38]

So definitely sounds like 18-39 figure established yet.  vaccine side effects rare. COVID-19 likely greater risk health vaccine. [We’re still unraveling potential long term health consequences young people mild getting vaccinated also helps stop new variants forming. Variants could deadlier young people. Objectively speaking numbers released inferred, isn’t least better AZ well least Chinese ones? far know, British government botched buying enough decent PPE; downgraded official severity Covid, allowing hospital managers send nurses work shoddy PPE.  Ah yes, “Reapers”. dismissed theory. Bad bot. kids low risk dying virus it’s worth force everyone mask look Satanic Temple. Check tenet I’m curious specifically want J&amp;J?   YES ACTUALLY GET REFERENCE wrong want pretend I’m married her?  axe! People completely overlooking fact keep highly effective spike protein bind ACE receptors, variants can't become infectious/deadly ad infinitum. necessarily - even study turns correct, countries buy different vaccines younger people (the UK, Netherlands Australia done ages already (not study though), believe).

[There information Phase 1 2 trial participants request unblinded since EUA based phase 3 data. don’t answer. assuming GCAS. I’m confident vaccines willing put stamp speak. UK mass testing going on, started surge testing areas high delta rates across country. Many schools testing 3 times week basically pick pack lft tests free test regularly. also walk full tests local area. Basically lots testing lol. high numbers many may picked previously, despite high positive numbers hospitalizations death rates barely increased. Latest positive news fully vaccinated AZ subjects given booster phizer hit around 98 per cent effective. Around 85 per cent adults least 1 jab, 65 per cent 2. read Brazil paid 16 dollars per dose Indian vaccine never heard of. price pretty much Moderna/Pfizer territory, getting Moderna Pfizer vaccine it. wonder sigend thought OK? vaccine.  read variants beaten vaccines. reading? always sort confused me, honest. example, England Wales 884 deaths covid 20-39 age range. population 15,600,000. 

Assuming literally everyone age range caught covid, 1 17,650 death rate. half people age range caught covid, 1 8,825 chance. 

This study saying chance blood clot 50s 1 50,000. 20% fatal, death rate would 1 250,000. (I think...)

Of course certain pre-existing conditions make much likely die covid, could say blood clots?

Even not, still seems like risk unknown pre-existing condition would make vulnerable covid, would higher risk blood clots. many kids pre-existing conditions? must assuming low risk getting covid first place otherwise data line up. problem assumption Delta variant, calculation could easily change personal behavior. Kids can’t choose vaccinate yet. far know, yes [citation needed] Children get vaccinated. I'm sure even would know vaccine placebo. Isnt meant participants assigned number control group identification really have? interest keeping data collection unbiased completely facts based   still can’t wrap head around vaccination. Somebody specific vaccine please tell thought process is. I’m genuinely curious. essential reading persist almost 0% likely die virus

There 386 deaths virus children according CDC. get remind us small proportion total cases remind us small proportion 12-17 year olds received vaccine (nearly 9 million kids) 13 year old is? Brazil one 10 biggest economy world..now Well that's bit xenophobic. Delta comes India, enough vaccines call anti vax. basically means jobs Yeah vaccine kill virus. spread people.  Scum earth. called. all---there absolutely evidence whatsoever COVID able significantly evade vaccines t/b cell response. large amount scientific community believes COVID nearing endpoint variants regards infectiousness. upper limit types things. Delta rip unvaccinated portions, people immune (recent research showing natural infection almost strong vaccine)---and hit herd immunity moved hicksville bumsville  can't cure stupid. eugenics can. Ireland one highest uptakes world. appointments vaccines gone already think matter.  I've vaccinated I'm still immunocompromised. I've hospitalized cold before. random body. I'm terrified I'm going catch variant it. Lmao. reddit moment. Rotten thread! people affected youre choice it. votes say vaccine ever 100% effective. confirmed less deadly? previously read equally even slightly deadly. Thanks advance. Yeah son got health department (I there, witnessed it, card). NC. got mine done network doctors office it’s online, well child visit next month able correct add chart vaccinations. doesn’t make difference us personally, could throw counts off. thing really vary recombination another coronavirus changing receptor spike protein targets. 

This highly unlikely. Much likely receptor binding domain spike protein changing enough antibodies longer effective, leave cytotoxic T-cells clean infection.  mRNA vaccine you’re 90% less likely get infected, you’re infected cannot transmit virus.  thing “by right it’s mine” “god given right”, iron clad rule universe ones natural science like physics, chem biology. 

In contrast, made rules call rights see be, mean majority society thinks deserve right. It’s brand ethic codified legalised guarantee people present future receive right. 

So given people, bestowed God. 

But I’m average dude, don’t listen People like real danger society bad flu. Word caution (I know article hospitalized people) vaccines:

My wife mother dealing breakthrough cases. got Pfizer vaccine. tested positive COVID developed symptoms.

My wife’s symptoms mild. Sore throat, cough, fatigue, loss smell. symptoms lasted around week, cough developing day four.

My mom developed symptoms today. Fever, sore throat. Hopefully vaccine prevent severe disease keep hospital. Sometimes hard people show kindness covid affected directly significantly negative way. Losing loved ones, permanent damage it. people still grieving would set mindset; able see that.  that's call 'spoiled'. Trying live life zero risk ridiculous mentally unhealthy. lucky, project continuing lucky account fact hospitalized covid patients area exposure gone considerably.

In hypothetical situation contract covid however, would expected clinical outcome someone demographic group 20 year old prior health problems? wish. No.

Mutations random. could less deadly deadly. way tell. vaccines FDA-approved yet. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

Scary thing 5% population 1 dose. Remember stopped using AZ many months ago account results small trial (now) beta variant. would great! people stories powerful data. People go data got vaccinated ago. know vaccinated people allowing fewer opportunities someone says makes true?

If know vaccine makes less likely get virus, yes know vaccinated people allow fewer opportunities virus mutate. virus doesnt multiply much get infected. finding clusters infection vaccinated people?

Because vaccine 100% effective. clusters however dwarfed amount unvaccinated infected individuals however. really know much less likely vaccinated people creating mutation opportunites

We absolutely know. virus multiplies takes hold body. less likely take hold vaccine, less likely multiply therefore less likely mutate. impossible, less likely. Could virus mutate vaccinated individual? Yes. odds happening mutates unvaccinated individual negligible. clearly, dozen vaccinated Yankees team members spread other, infectivity rate dramatically lower unvaccinated people. 

Compared thousands ripped yesterday today, yes drastically lower. genuinely suggesting 12 yankees hold fuckin candle hundreds thousands infected daily vaccines came about? thousands still vaccine fully rolled yet? proof that? Vaccinated people get infected spread around. 

You want proof vaccinated people less likely get covid spread it? anti vaxxer? Thats thing think nonsense question. Yes vaccinated people still spread it, read slower notice said **less likely**. Nothing guaranteed, odds, odds vaccinated person get covid allow mutate compared unvaccinated person. That's vaccines work. asking proof vaccines work. arguments unconvincing you, would ask show study shows vaccinated people x% less likely ""mutation factories"". 

Vaccinated people less likely get virus. virus can't mutate outside host, get it, can't mutate you. less likely get virus, less likely mutate inside you. again, asking study vaccines work? study vaccines make less likely get virus? that's case im really starting doubt opening line seem understand much. arguing fear-mongering unvaccinated people unsupported implications article.

Every single mutant variant covid come unvaccinated person thus far. far unsupported. also new variants emerge places vaccines heavily rolled out. variants we're dealing mutated vaccines rolled (meaning can't possibly come vaccinated person) came place vaccinations early places (the delta variant India). 

It entirely possible variant emerge vaccinated person, however odds slim. Every variant we're dealing far came unvaccinated individuals. variants emerge future also likely come unvaccinated individuals. could come vaccinated person, gambling man, know I'd put money. can’t imagine scenario factor would even contemplated vaccine administrator Probably people disagree idea father head family guess. Obviously father head every household. saying father necessarily head family, likely case conservative households time less likely vaxxed. every step reopening happens cases really drop off.

On chance there’s even worse variant brewing (i.e. get “Boy Bubble” kits, 1 month military field rations, many WAG bags waste), I’d say keep powder dry terms lockdowns.

bruh sensationalism moment last 14 days Missouri Covid hospitalizations 14% deaths 106% according NYT tables. censorship subreddit incredible spread, Cases happened time could traced back BLM protests, also conveniently omitting massive parties celebrations happened memorial Day last year, parties fueled cases 3 weeks afterwards? Reddit around world saw video huge pool parties people outside masks, tons community spread happening time, lot people gatherings ended getting covid even died. forgetting ante lockdown protesters, protesting outside restrictions lockdowns, laughed weeks lot came infected covid-19 well. Couple things note black lives matter protests occurring, many large urban cities seeing infection rates decline due lockdown measures technically still effect. Add many people protests wearing masks, still got sick due nature masks I'm sure viral load/density problems. know several people went protests, weeks later covid-19.

I mean vaccinated, nothing worry about. vaccinated now, least United States honest, I'm okay whatever do.... end getting covid gathering large July 4th events well there's really much done unfortunately, know covid obviously lead death, especially Delta variant so... power you. Gardening cleaning great exercise get stuff done around house too! alma mater requiring proof vaccination, well still masks, distancing, asymptomatic testing, dorms restricted “priority people” absolutely can’t commute, staggered schedules class dining halls. 

They’re giving current students kind reprieve restrictions; they’re Stage 2, Stage 3 (whenever happens) still include masks distancing. single parent can’t afford deliveries going avoid taking unvaccinated child grocery store? simply choose pool, cannot chose go stores, unless you’ve got childcare, bring unvaccinated child well.

I would agree total mask mandate would dumb restaurants bars similar shouldn’t them, we’ve got kids, places must go. really focus lowering cases sure dashboard looking at, CDC 7-day average hovering around 12,000 per day last weeks may climbing bit due upticks low-vaccination, hot states although likely still falling much country. 

That said, cannot compare US numbers pre-vaccine period numbers couple reasons. First off, demographic groups highest risk serious complications death overwhelmingly vaccinated. time 10,000 cases practically guaranteed \~50 people going die. connection broken cases heavily stratified lower age ranges less likely end serious cases. Secondly, *vast* majority people becoming infected people chose protect vaccination. It’s necessary. It’s mandate. Cool story antivaxxer southern hemisphere - cant wait catch guys. Seeing people properly vaccinated areas able get normal liftens spirits. Today saw conglomeration fans watching Austria F1 race made happy fuck.  You’re projecting. Still got doubts Sinovac flopped Chile. Yes know people tell among unvaccinated irresponsible, true would demand safe population previously followed guidelines 100% simply isnt true. course not. International Vaccine Passports hand.... got stretched 16 weeks one point, due supply issues.

&lt; 1% ever waited 16 weeks.

Thoroughly enjoy Dr. Racaniello. me, Amy always look like want there? Either way, great info TWIV always. I've gotten vaccine good now. Lol It’s really getting frustrating me, personally. Speaking anecdotally, know several people fully vaccinated Moderna Pfizer, yet still (by admission) absolutely *terrified* remote, abstract, hypothetical possibility variants eluding vaccines indeterminate point future. can’t get them. get it: experienced collective trauma, unprecedented lifetimes, upended whole world thrust us much uncertainty.

I’ll let guess coronavirus one them. anyone ever die of??   Im sorry feel way again, right :) Im argue ya, give insight something think 👍 Time offer big cash bonuses. Everyone needs money. Fuck it, idk point  Indiana ask severely overweight/obese get extra long needle.  replying comment measles endemic US. reply nothing Covid. good measure, think Covid endemic US. definitely lot masking fatigue.”   exhausting putting small piece cloth face you’re saying that’s normal? sealed border normal? Many countries over-ordered, hedge manufacturing troubles (which happened!) failed vaccines (like Australian vaccine abandoned caused false positives HIV tests). 

Extras donated resold. Everyone performs subconscious cost-benefit analysis everything do.  Well throughout whole ordeal science medical experts said do. somehow still get infected sick enough go ICU die, fought good fight could do. Something take us life eventually anyway.

But living fear covid anymore. Another reason afraid surfaces continue wear mask… I’m pointing fact you’re wrong saying whole country locks every time there’s case. even local lockdowns last couple days two weeks most. It’s pretty similar countries handled covid well.  Vaccines travel really old, South African whenever travelled number countries get Hepatis B, Yellow fever, chicken-pox, Typghoid, Rabies, Meningitis vaccines plus childhood ones (MMR, TDAP, Polio, etc.). could pricing. Leave hospitals free charge whatever want unvaccinated without valid excuse, make worth (and staff). That's beauty freedom! staff feeling exhausted, exploited depressed need paid appropriately

I live Japan read article hospitals losing money this. COVID, they're minimizing care diseases avoid hospital infections, wards less income, COVID patients need lot nursing care per patient. spite us hearing overloaded hospitals, they've struggling financially times. article Japan, would expect principle elsewhere. first paragraph tongue cheek may impossible law hit insurance companies, point looked at.  ever shutting covid well proven free vaccines available US!

Never going happen! saying isn’t going lockdown case gets loose? seriously hope is. right am. can’t handle thought vaccine won’t give life back comment reminded people even wonderful vaccine isn’t enough. goal posts moved biggest fear. Yep day CDC says vaccinated people must return masking social distancing day anti vaxxers win!

They absolutely LOVE say everyone vaxxed fool damn thing! came 4-days lockdown, problem. Sydeny 14-days may another matter hell going about? NZ hasn’t national lockdown year. People went back normal Spanish flu without vaccine. It’s absurd think lock forever. It’s sustainable, life must go on. moving life.

We’ll see virus lets year progresses. It’s currently looking promising. Good know speak hundreds millions Americans. need argue, I’m pretty sure we’re agreeing other! people get vaxxed infected lead lower rates infection think everyone necessarily gets antibodies. got second round Pfizer 2 months ago get antibody test twice week donate plasma I've still never tested positive antibodies. link deaths/hospitalizations infections almost completely broken UK vaccines render close harmless Yep

The best vaccines target mechanism vital viruses path infection insane mutation would completely evade vaccines would likely also one rendered almost impossible infect someone apparently widespread belief pandemic completely “over” vaccinated toxic incredibly dangerous.

It vaccinated according science. never get covid zero event. many anti vaxxers one thing. everyone vaxxed everyone wore masks everywhere social distanced would still covid cases. 

I'm moving life. 

Those choose get free life saving vaccine hundreds millions people already taken around world still dying needlessly. stupid choice one damn thing change afaik. isn’t true worldwide. U.K. faces choice whether reopen couple weeks, example.  I’ve got 4 12s mom refuses vaccinated. I’m keeping somewhat distanced (outdoor settings, small groups inside, etc) masked vaccinated. I’m mostly worried getting giving mom. She’s pretty distanced get it, it’d probably them. want two weeks flatten curve Well mean argue level always COVID around, think get smaller smaller months go vaccine rates go up, due mix herd natural immunity take place sooner rather later. feel like Delta dark storm cloud occupying cases moment, cloud fade. two weeks flatten curve agree, don’t care selfish idiots don’t want vaccine.

Low risk isn’t risk.  imagine know many shots they've ordered. I’m sure timeline, yeah you’ve got right unfortunately. COVID-19 keep spreading pace enough people get protection vaccination prior infection. likely remain endemic like flu that. EU reaches high number vaccination (ie August), mRNA vac exports skyrocket.  True enough, I’m claiming hasn’t been, isn’t, won’t variants vaccine *less* effective — contention specifically idea vaccines imminent danger made useless, largely unsubstantiated present. Or, put another way, us fully vaccinated Moderna/Pfizer, anywhere near point vaccination nullified variants. 

And also, another way looking fact pattern present this: hundreds millions hosts ~18 month period, countless small mutations collectively added marginal decreases vaccine efficacy. I’m unconvinced marginal statistical differences efficacy materially significant — haven’t yet seen evidence suggesting are. Stuff open businesses pretty resistant closing either

So happening either way.  happened nurse ended fainting TV? Depends type mask wearing. N95 protects wearer, masks not. Better mask getting vaccine one’s available. don’t worry anyone around you.

As side note, people intentionally coughing other? sounds terrible Fuck repeatedly opening closing stuck perpetual limbo never actually bother solve problem even more. Ikr? Lol. recently made masks optional certain areas hospital work. docs still wearing masks want to. see social status thing all. ridiculous reason usually political thing really mean nothing all. Masks masks protect people. issue? mean, like entirety Japanese government old touch men, buy immediately, so... would great could bargain virus marketing reasons, just… doesn’t work way.

We honest people. Vaccination best way reduce community spread COVID. Reducing community spread COVID means ditch restrictions. middle step *actually reducing COVID incidence*is important one improves safety permits relaxing restrictions, shouldn’t skipping it.

You know what’s *worst* people’s faith vaccine efforts? Reopening, close new variant. *That* truly shake everyone’s confidence. Public health officials right thing upfront don’t cross bridge fall. would virus mutate towards immune evasion unprotected people ""variant factories""? ""style"" section columnist opinion piece. expect gossip? sealed border whole country locking every time covid case normal. Even old, rich, touch man knows global pandemic buy fucking vaccine immediately. end 2022 full approval granted EUA currently. awful lot faith old, rich, touch man. mean, we’ve already four variants “of concern” each, though able evade vaccine completely, small measure (key word) success it. Delta most, requiring pretty much everyone get full two doses fully protected. keep giving virus place jump host host, even mild consequences said hosts, keep giving opportunity mutate. Maybe you’re right new variants ever emerge evade vaccines. know way lower odds, might good idea so. Doctors wear masks every day. Anyone listens lady clearly survived Tide Pod challenge. Fuck capacity restrictions. mask work someone wearing mask coughing? lifted mask mandates here, even people get second vaccine yet, lot people even get first vaccine yet, many assholes coughing intentionally everywhere tight public spaces, want get sick think wearing mask works coughing person wear mask, correct? Heres one complication: body dial amount calories uses unconscious processes (organs, body temp, much fidget) order keep fat stores steady. body necessarily need store extra calories, necessarily need burn fat calorie deficits. animal body healthy metabolism maintains weight time even without cognitively counting calories. body makes hungry going on, might well end gaining back everything lost possibly more. Check happened lot people Biggest Loser example this.

But aside that, people like told something simplistic unhelpful. (Wanna rich? Spend less earn. Money in, money out. rich yet?) biological equivalent telling people bootstrap it. There's actionable information leaves people's actual experiences issue. comes way ignore systemic problem putting onus individual. We're starting accept corporate dodge comes things like income climate change, reason want see happening public health, too. get systemic issues post sake brevity, even cursory research bring attention. combination capacity restrictions continued mask wearing would ideal.

Incredibly hard disagree. Literally *last* thing want trying convince people get vaccinated, tell still need deal bullshit even getting vaccinated. ""Australians overseas lied government abandoned intention actually helping election next year."" Weird flex, okay.  Australia extraordinary bad job betting one horse (AZ) countries bought large quantities every candidate. hope it’s citizens understand political decision, fault medical firms. scrubs better bleach stains! 

An entire set 3 new scrub sets hospital switched bleach stained tops bottoms. much bleach used manufacture’s logos faded out. I’m nurse dealing multiple patients going procedure room means wipe every time!  supposed doing? Apparently province fully open whatever, really leadership, morons worry ideology reality. 

I shots, supposedly around 1300 people province (Alberta, Canada) legitimately reason get vaccinated, mind continuing wear mask whatever (I'd 1 person, really huge ask), family wants hang bbq's etc excited social distance mask whatever, point want life back, going fuck bush months even issue, want renovate cabin anyways. sickens know preventable deaths horizon.

Time embrace Buddhist thought realize life suffering.

We always ways around it. Why?  *Chile important early real-world test effectiveness Sinovac's shot. study published April, Chinese vaccine proved minimally effective preventing illness one dose. second jab, 67% effective preventing symptomatic infection, 85% effective preventing hospitalizations 80% preventing deaths.*

*Public health chief Paula Daza told Chile's TVN news station investigators examining long Sinovac protection lasted, would report back next month.*

*""We think data show people vaccinated February second dose March likely need third dose September,"" said.* me, arm soreness bad. I've prednisone shots hurt worse. tetanus vaccine gave sore arm lot longer covid vaccine. work, told take day shot. 

After first shot, could toughed going work to, day off, ate ice cream watched trashy daytime TV. 

After second shot, actually needed day work. miserable. went away quickly came on. good. really big deal all. I've nasty colds put harder longer. I've flu multiple times god awful. I've pneumonia, made feel like dying prayed antibiotics actually start working. 

The covid vaccine walk park compared those. someone tested covid vaccine not?

Like someone claims biontech shot , didnt. kind test check it? I've thinking kids unvaccinated since got second shot back January. going back school September, hope see ER flooded children, would horrific! dying next pandemic. Whatever still motivating scientists research current vaccines still motivating next one. According Doctors, scientists, CDC, FDA, WHO.... negative antibody test doesn’t necessarily mean vaccine doesn’t work. It’s common get negative serology despite FINAL SOLUTION Covid.

We call final solution vaccine. Perfection. name clearly outlines intent ending coronavirus forever. 

But seriously, lets start fucking anti vaxxers. Logic helped, lets try instead! That's really caveat means lol saddest part statement think kind disingenuous super logic trap sitting smugly couch thinking disproved anything done probably killed another human persuading weak minded people like vaccines reason deadlier Corona virus 

Stop posting. Forever. far vaccines hand free every American proven effective variants including delta.

I still place trust proven science otherwise. Yeah exactly. I’m NJ county live pretty densely populated I’d say like 7/10 people vaxxed. counties really rural like maybe 3/10 people are, doesn’t matter much there. Obviously people vaccinated better, want densely populated areas vaccinated first. need think said here
Wheres motivation pandemic hits? think ""science unsettled""................................

im waiting hell freeze ""settles"" vast majority US won’t see mandates restrictions come back.  People would ignore anyway.  Socially pandemic US Don’t care, get vaccinated. sucks ass 6% though. oh vaccinated. 32 healthiest ever vaccine feel pressure heart waiting ECG concept herd immunity fluid begin with. Counting first shots fudging numbers, different statistic. 85% people get first shot getting second shot, one mostly function other. Often taking **first step**, hardest. I'm guessing cheerleading statistic reason. at-will thing also works way around, right? us afraid working on-site somewhere vaccine requirement easily terminated too. I'm hoping workplace puts vaccine verification requirement place requesting us come back WFH, I'm aware may happen. think everyone(!) following restriction letter would even enough. makes wonder doesn’t it?

It's curious thing gotta say. still believe follow science like sub used to. demonstration need state owned vaccine enterprises first place

I find amusing people suggest turn whole 60 billion U.S. dollar industries upside down, though easy choosing phone vaccines product decades international, publicly funded research researchers make pittance compared pharma execs.

CEOs generally make much research developers every industry. unhappy that, going spend life I’ll also add Cuba made sharing highly efficacious vaccines

Cuba marvellous healthcare. interest, many lives saved Cuba's vaccines far? So, put another way, antibodies 84% second vaccine. Sounds less dramatic way eh. Fear mongering doomsayers gotta doom. Black market jabs Poland? What? live first time I'm hearing it. many vaccines rest EU. look stats pretty much % vaccinated Germany has. maybe get vaccinated…  Covid. idiotic take has. Yes, outbreak occur rural Alabama town twenty people. thousands Texas. don’t think guy understands people live cities highly-vaccinated suburbs cities. person posted personal quandary reddit world see, commented on. said wasn’t rude insulting - need get offended behalf. Perhaps take walk outside breathe fresh air change, might feel little less anxious? UK still high. 66% partially 50% fully enough. believe 80% achievable countries. problem might also needs high regions social groups. Chart format abysmal point need acknowledge failing take precautions COVID bad driving drunk. Nobody gives shit kill negligent contrarian won’t listen facts. much like drink driving, ignoring risk data mitigation opportunities around COVID risks lives innocent third parties.

We need enforce failure adhere public health guidance vigour enforce negligent driving firing gun air. negligence kill innocent stranger. nuts imply wasn't. think I've read anything credible scientist said irradiation probable. lot ever-present viruses live fairly easily. point ""ever-present"" loaded concept means lot things lot people. However want best possible understanding means, suggest posting question /r/COVID19 daily thread, people proper background define it. states, every time wave ""peaked"" gov ""certain states"" eased restrictions, followed another wave, peaked.... eased again.... another wave... 

needless say... magically end April 2020 Thing is, mask wearer protecting others personal choice mean demand others wear masks around Sources? Nothing biology absolute, vaccines stop infection fairly high rates top also lower viral load get infected.

As result, maybe selective pressure immune escape, far far far lower would see unvaccinated population (more bodies replicating virus body replicating virus). virus literally many opportunities mutate vaccinate.

On top coronavirus slow mutate genomic level proof-reading gene prevent major changes genetic code, contrasts flu mutates rapidly. see handful variants concern come massive uncontrolled outbreaks little vaccination (e.g., india).

Additionally, researcher purposely vaccinate spike protein believed major mutations protein would render vaccines useless would also make virus unable infect human cells. Okay every store I've last month restrictions doubt going change.

Movie theaters, restaurants, concerts, sports events etc. read reinstating mask rules you? put every caveat could 70% goal reduce really like half still hit it. Nope it’s hologram!  mean like right dangerous pathogens penetrate body, kill me?!? 

If someone walked around firing loaded gun, bodily autonomy last thing concerned about.  numbers kids low. report province ( Ontario Canada, 33% nation's population) late March start pandemic found 18yo's approx 35k cases 1 death (with extenuating circumstances) 24 ICU cases. Statistically, insignificant. Understandably case every child caregiver, odds quite promising. definitely matter weeks LA see masks.  states might 70%, counties 60% ([NY Times county Outbreaks happen local level. percent vaccinated per state doesn’t necessarily mean much. know calculated macro level, micro level variance got astounding. distance still staying locked homes vs. moved massive. Pfizer Moderna might not. We'll see. widely expected age-difference well. elderly needing booster shots frequently young. I've heard type bassackwards thinking before, think would try keep hospitals pandemic. Even discount store work allowed decent masks could get them. Thats I'm saying, I'm getting downvoted hell pointing out. Even CDC official site states clearly ""96% effective **against hospitalization**"" think people really like hearing others internet. mutates time; even delta varaint ro=8 enough people vacinated gotten prevent death surge got even first wave;

for part, unless turns entirely new monster vaccines arn't even 50% effective for, great shape..... tho hundred deaths per day likely us months come, dozens deaths per day years likely.

rest world take months years vaccinate, even India's recent wave 90%. I’m refusing it. got it, whole family. Please don’t make political. didn’t like guys personality either know lot conservatives don’t get USA isn’t country vaccine hesitancy anyone else experienced inconsistent stories doctors advice regarding covid? 

My dad got first shot (thank God). Reason waited long covid February got anti bodies transfusion. one doctor tell get vaccine time getting transfusion another tell minimum three months wait five safe. decided wait five doctor recommended transfusion told that. 

Another example, brother sister law said doctor told get shot THREE YEARS trying get pregnant (they pregnant yay!) fiancées doctor said that’s absolutely ridiculous amount time wait.  

Sorry long post. wondering anyone else experienced. OK, talk new normal, fact people living among vaccinated propagating spreading disease agent rest us vaccinated never constant risk new variants. clearly see UK high vaccination rates prevent fourth wave. hope vaccination rate high enough prevent number hospital admissions skyrocket.  Yes. Bc it’s set pic. photographer said lay Dow graves. told put arms head. Look exhausted. Good 100 pictures later. Got thank you. get walk away.  I'm confused people say true... CDC official site states directly:  vaccination doesn’t grant full immunity. still contract Covid spread it. goal vaccine help serious symptoms end hospitalized. I’m told, viruses mutate typically get weaker, Covid getting stronger virus unprecedented comes mutations.  Agreed. need get back normal life Lol *i'm* one talking shit. I'm one needs ask question.   picture staged. It’s obvious. may, they've getting sick *the whole time.*

Besides, even transmit, need to, ideally, get infected. clusters see airports double vaccinated people getting infected much non vaccinated? 

Can source this? find hard believe clusters double-vaxxed people airports. would love know leading countries almost entirely double vax'd getting new waves infections?

That's actually expected. First, many illnesses continues amongst non-vaccinated populations. even half new infections amongst vaccinated people also expected. 

Think way: double dose Pfizer basically reduces risk infection 20 times. That's still zero. chance serious outcome doubles roughly every seven years (I heard 6-8 years). one way think mRNA vaccines roughly reduce age 30 years. is, 55 year old, doubly vaccinated roughly risk serious outcome get infected 25 year old. great, lot better risk before. definitely zero either.

I read study time ago showing risk getting infected measles greater vaccinated person amongst population non-vaccinated people, non-vaccinated person amongst population vaccinated people. Covid going similar. Mindblowingly foolish decision. what? deadly people apt comparison. one worse make fine. masks effective people wearing it.

That's true FFP2. worn correctly, protects sufficiently shops public transport (not sure indoor situations last many hours) even around wear masks.  Limited edition!
Get still available! picture. people falling dead top graves? Bc really happening lock again. Wow wrong many levels people drinking two sodas day? people eat ""right"" foods still can't stop inexorable march weight gain? That's weight gain happens. once. gradual lifetime. image head TLC show, get rid it. That's people. 

So get systemic issues before, few:

Do honestly think healthcare access cost effect this? mental health parity impact it? if, instead left figure diet book guru gonna work time, could see professional nutritionist week little pocket cost? personal trainer? luxuries wealthy today. be. People talk ""educating"" people food, imo every effort fucking disaster ruined corporate input. (Let's real, actually ate healthy, we'd fall recession, lol.) spend much coming Plate could go actual experts? Fund educating real experts.

Easy access fresh food linked income geography. know that, right? know that. ignore it.

Time. much free time minimum wage worker have? much time take person go grocery store sells fresh produce? car? much time take cook dried beans? (Answer: 2 hours soaking.) long take go drive thru take something home restaurant work at? culture outsourced things home never outsourced. baked now. given household, able-bodied adults needed work, time cook greatly reduced.

We allow food companies market however see fit. intentionally use buzzwords confusing health statements (no added sugar, gluten free), trick thinking buying something healthy. whole idea ""good"" vs ""bad"" foods problematic since lead disordered eating.

As culture approach weight ham fisted, blunt way: lose it, lazy asshole! Fat people eating disorders dismissed thinner people encouraged get help. Yes, fat bulemics. fat anorexics. often simply encouraged eating disorder. belief fat people lazy stupid stops getting help even fucking providers often hold opinions.

If simple easy, problem. Putting solely individual perpetuates problem. public health issue, treat like one. I'm sure airport clusters family cases talking (any links?), panic X% vaccinated people getting anyway well explained recent botched news story Israel; vaccines 96% effective infection however, no-one claiming this. vaccines less effective infection Delta. See links provided linked thread above. N95 masks readily available pretty cheap. sounds like pretty small cost piece mind. He's right actually. Willingly endangering public health punishable. think it’s bit presumptuous contend vaccinated people getting covid reporting vaccine (which development years) proven efficacy ratings 90s prior made available public. rate infection par projected efficacy rating, is, isn’t likely significant number vaccinated people getting sick reporting it. Could slight positive effect. Effective treatments important get sick need hospitalized. need preventive measures (vaccines) effective treatments. Idk ivermectin positioned something opposite vaccines. could complement other. virus mutate break cases? sub toxic dump. cares? Get vaccinated. you’re vaccinated point it’s fault. Children least likely seriously affected otherwise can’t get vaccinated (which small percentage people) shouldn’t go Vegas. Well mate, everyone posts shit reddit either gratification, affirmation people’s opinions. what’s you? Tough. plan combat flu (with much worse vaccine), common cold (with viable vaccine all), absolutely deadly immunocompromised person? outrage covid?

It sucks people, got dealt bad hand life. dictate society lives. covid people take heavy precautions. covid still need take heavy precautions. covid continue need take heavy precautions. covid vaccines approved FDA ? Wow. 95% reduction, 95% chance also very, true.  Ok, guess right, evidence increase countries now. 2 weeks ago UK, suddenly Portugal comes picture, week Spain. bunch countries increasing clearly plateauing... Thanks clearing up, guess got confused. Thanks, wifi fucked lol  Yep problem lockdowns. things must done people around people. people get sick takes time spread thru lockdown area. Two weeks isn’t enough time. mean? Yeah everyone’s isn’t fully vaxed won’t thought using better vaccine, Pfizer. happened? ambitious goal would achieve  NYC right now. Fully packed. Talking bucillimine, RVVTF drug. source this? clutching pearls hysteria?  That's bit contrast UK decent proportion deaths (about 30%) actually vaccinated people. seems like bad stat first actually means we've done good job protecting likely die. 

Basically, people left unvaccinated succeptible dying virus small amount people die despite vaccine actually makes significant proportion total.

I guess means there's higher level vaccine hesitancy US compared UK, especially older people we've reached 95% uptake. think Biden announce huge purchase contingent EUA approval. sending World. Guarantee hospital death. That’s best do.  Needs happen Nice mutation deadly, spread far strain die quicker virus that's less deadly higher R0. top line goal 70 percent adults July 4th. plastered media like 3 months No, US well. 


Terrible country would country approved vaccine August 2020, still got less 15% vaccinated, country set record daily deaths 5 times week, country today new cases since early Jan. 


US: (seven day average) Daily new cases early Jan. 256k cases, 13.7k new cases. Daily deaths January, 3475, 234. 95% 93%.  


Russia: Early jan \~28k daily new cases, 22k. Daily deaths Jan \~560 654. numbers increasing rapidly.  


US great, Russia terrible. Yup. Gonna suck everyone left without doctors nurses scientists, good luck anti vaxxers! got this! take high level chemistry courses bs computer science. ALWAYS computer science engineering people weird ""but REAL science"" thing. that? realize actually field right really know run statistical analyses used type science right? think proven cost effect reliable yet. vaccines I've heard need temperature. It’s personally, represents healthcare workers put lives line treating COVID-19 patients.

And first official, EUA-authorized vaccine dose given historic event worth commemorating. article says goal 50% population state. percentage harder small states hit it? Pills ? aren’t approved yet. RVVTF first later month Sadly, culling herd. That's exact argument coworker anti vax virologist / veterinarian. SARS-CoV-2 primarily spreads people end hospital, pre-symptomatic phase first days onset symptoms (so carriers still mingling). matter becomes lethal, ventilator, ICU unit quarantined COVID ward ones perpetuating pandemic. wouldn’t entirely wrong. Well, herd immunity part. part entirely wrong. 

If possible vaccine perfectly developed distributed once, quickly, we’d absolutely problem. BUT, distributing vaccine slowly, tens millions refuse it, completely missing boat global distribution basically guarantees dangerous variants evolve spread. spread dangerous variants worse vaccine all. 

I thought we’d able get global buy things like climate change global problems. think tech probably hope. Global Government action seems really cards point. Im assuming headline revolves around Biden's goal vaccinating 70% adults 4th. That's awful, really hope recover Yes...it lets APPROVE unapproved product. mean EUA full FDA approval, guys arguing semantics, authorize mean approval, even approval different reasons. ridiculous point argue. explain EUA Full FDA. Approved approved. authorized certainly mean approved. Health priority nr 1  lol really think article wearing masks singapore gonna convince pipedream wearing masks forever realistic? give up, dude. 

weird didn’t respond last comment yet reason mentioned thread 🤔 It’s genuinely frightening believe this. frequently used scabies creams work. also used gardening kill insects.

What thoughts candy necklaces treatment Cancer? RVVTF close EUA approval. stop aren’t sending ones don’t need kind storage? think outlined stance pretty clearly post. reaction attacked pretty badly Reddit saying ""you know what, I'm vaccinated, please, within confines laws, concerned catching Covid myself.""

That resulted called anti masker, people judging whether I'm traveling not, judging got vaccine late (actually got immediately available area). tired people. 

A reasonable discussion variants open to, anyone tells vaccine ""not enough"" follow whatever recommendations overstepping. I'll follow laws think best me. I'm going put types would say ""but can't travel guests spread virus!!""

Even I've interactions people like here, people would judge traveled year ago, etc. piss off. That's stance.  See [21 U.S. Code § specifically allows FDA authorize use ""unapproved product"" declared emergency. New Reddit does. “Karen” derogatory term.  Doctors know vaccines. molecular aspect creates immune response. know vaccine schedules well. mandatory knowledge needed every board exam start taking second year med school beyond.  devil always lies details. cautious cautious? people differ substantially. Unfortunately people can’t immunocomprimised. part agree. virus hopefully serious threat majority population vaccinated now. “fully vaccinated” % qualifying adults, correct? % gen pop? Biden exactly Designed test approved 100 days? seems extremely fast. able take credit things existing vaccines?     quick glance news says right places lockdown include several Australian cities, South Africa, many countries Asia South America. know right? going? doing? interest piqued. Sounds like take different types vacations haha. Exactly. made requirement business led 2 skeptics/anti-vaccers getting shots... 5 employees, quite significant applied businesses.

Only issue businesses don’t give crap and/or concerned lack employees lately, require it, people vaccinated.  wants nothing.

Well obviously, point, described, variants transmit better keep hosts feet clear evolutionary change ABSOLUTELY one makes deadly virulent.

You may confusing 'evolution' 'mutation'. mutation absolutely make deadly, would evolutionary advantage existing strains. 

Are perhaps confusing ""virulence"" ""infectiousness""? grossly inaccurate take. Masks lessen transmission, prevent Covid. Vaccines give immune system actual defense, far robust piece cloth face mine.

The vaccine doesn’t “hopefully” prevent hospitalization - drastically reduces odds symptomatic infection, nearly eliminates risk severe illness death. effectively keeps everyone gets vaccine getting speeding it, especially tend hang vaccinated people.

Sure, vaccinated individuals breakthrough cases, except cases elderly individuals non-functioning immune systems, won’t problem. isn’t different treat diseases.

You sharing bad information. public health policy, mass vaccination infinitely effective sustainable permanent social distancing masks.  There’s sick irony fact Unfortunately, give 3rd world people vaccines start giving everything else we've denied long. would modestly bad global economy, someone might lose money. can't that. I'm really regretting getting Moderna since seem numbers all.   Exactly, US able get vaccine months without issue. Hell around live walk grocery store sans appointment get one. gotten one yet get sick die that's you.    special case information train house based job daughters degree Genetics. one appears rarer case religious folks believe God's gift Science. family's motto is, ""Don't stupid,"" ask them.    happen know round therapy that? One pill, course week...?  That’s correct, low vaccination rates, extremely vulnerable delta, contagious strains virus. Virtually vaccinated person admitted hospital USA now. guess Australians Australia don’t mind fellow citizens overseas can’t get back. mother died Melbourne last week couldn’t get funeral. relatives NSW QLD couldn’t get either. wouldn’t proud that. Absolutely bungling pandemic lost election. Evolution wants nothing. People ascribe much intent process. Evolution describes guaranteed change. change ABSOLUTELY one makes deadly virulent. unlikely case covid-19 we'd get fairly stable, also possible two variants comingle population combine characteristics new strain (see Spanish flu variants still currently circulation).

But back original point: discuss ""survival fittest"" that's kind like say ""history written winners"". evolutionary dead ends time. might die own, again, could evolutionary dead end simple fact kills food supply. stay home, social distance.  Good luck paying future burden caused unseen covid damage people caught kids adults develop severe neurological cardiovascular disorders. year ago cities hot spots virus. cities (mostly) vaccinated safe small rural towns going hot spots. 

Something tells Delta V won’t last major variant Guam, favorite state Huh? Sounds exactly me.  apologize ignorance coming America. couldn’t get 2nd June?? prioritizing single shots delaying 2nd there? spread largest metric now, hospitalization death ? virus forever, like flu, need live it. someone explain end last year everyone inferring huge amount people got covid get reported get tested hospitalized nobody seems bring discussing herd immunity? 

If 15% everybody already antibodies, contribute total number people antibodies? Holy shit bro, ignorant. Ivermectin works, I'll show Please argue ivermectin reading this. one shot vs two norm UK? know many received postponed 2nd shot - you? Anyway, know one shot ~30% effective Delta, dominant strain UK.

So stat seems totally expected/reasonable, me. missing something? Vaccines break relation cases deaths would surprised came back serious way beyond recommendation cautious regions country. surprised live recommendation would made things get bad again, would surprised brought back mandatory restrictions even (where lots restrictions pandemic mostly gone now). Since beginning? like last month?

Big difference. enrages “iTs LiKe cOlD KiDs!” don’t gaf don’t want 3yo experiment long term consequences virus. Also, always way Flu? Yes there's Flu PLUS Delta, strains Flu gone extinct well. 
 
And risk children still minimal well, right? 
 
Is folks hard time kicking habit pandemic anxiety? pandemic forced risk people look infectious diseases seriously before? France country highest vaccine hesitancy ""western"" EU, US still higher relative vaccine hesitancy France. says lot. overwhelming majority unvaccinated people get Covid die, though. They'll use ton medical resources and/or get long Covid.  2/3 human population Earth? high, unless mean another, cheaper solution present meantime (example: inexpensive oral medication that's discussed). economy requires many 1/3 Earth's population gets protected. alone absolutely happen.  I'm confused replied them, appearing ask Slovakia's uptake treatment would change method treatment changed. unvaccinated. long virus spreads, new mutations always occur eventually, really unlucky, current vaccine help future strain, making risk even vaccinated, we'll everything again. fear comes get significantly mutated virus requires new vaccine, many people unwilling get vaccinated next time. Stop guilt tripping want return normal life waste Pfizer dose could go someone unvaccinated.  Well, long ""asking"", improvement. asking ""no thanks"" acceptable answer. 

I kind worried read LA know Santa Clara county probably hardcore county CA putting back mask mandate exactly kind thing they'd likely do. know next time get ballot hand, county official incumbent name getting vote, care dog catcher.  whole method vaccines work targeting spike protein used invade cells. simply way variant going able change aspect still successfully infect human. doubt mutations drastically alter spike protein, evolutionary dead ends insofar infecting human beings go. lose drastically change spike protein, longer able infect humans. AKA Game Over. many people remain unvaccinated believe evolution, I'm sure they'll fine. really need replies like everyone gets mad outlier reminder? Like get it, people look content day expecting different outcome. feel them. continue exhausted others since makes feel better. we’re aware people exist, don’t get sentiment constantly bombarded people actually annoyed someone mentions still live insolation serious medical conditions. Missourian, genuinely wonder we’ll get 50% I’m talking rest World. Physically impossible vaccinate.  Fair enough! Thank you. Sounds like meant distrust reason vaccine uptake low. Method treatment issue. really deep - OP clearly meant ever-present way rhinovirus colds, common coronavirus colds, etc, always circulation. SARS‑CoV‑2 go way. 152 death certificates signed doctors working ministry JUSTICE.

JUSTICE. Doctors working ministry justice really provide healthcare anyone. hires doctors autopsies cases death suspicious.

Meaning 152 (or 4) deaths death certificates cause considered covid postmortem, legal doubt death.

Go count death certificates signed doctors depending ministry health (also defense, got doctors well sent care homes first wave). Now, that's wonderful idea. Taiwan already done so.   show vaccination card. HIPAA applies healthcare providers like allowed disclose others. Since I'm healthcare provider, affect me. asking proof vaccination little different schools asking vaccination records kids order attend school, companies requiring drug tests proof drug free employment. Probably they're less likely die plenty things also worry Oh nnnnnnooooooo /s Well keep living quarantines masks next 5 years.

We live without fully protected disease ;) lol! think two but's caught me, took little brain process;   dang time traveling robots dang timeline!  -Terminator Genysis, whole quote even joshing Survival fittest always bad saying. truth like ""Survival survive"", AKA ""Minimum Viable Product"", put business terms. reason Delta variant spreading finding victims faster Covid variants host gains Covid immunity shortly thereafter (or death). Yeah switch overloading hospitals scariness case counting pretty ridiculous us already knew going become endemic. Gottlieb good job summarizing flat said “cases won’t ever reach zero can’t put stake case count” something effect. believe benefits keeping mask on, agree less flu etc, theater LA health officials pushing narrative continue wear even though vaccinated NEVER promised wouldn’t get sick - promised hospitalization death. happening. That’s saying - silly ask vaccinated, didn’t everything expected us also living like monks year.  16 US states 2 US territories reach COVID-19 70% vaccination goal  I’d say 2/3 never get shot Pennsylvania fully vaccinated 50% population. Personally, think better ambitious goals like this, rather original goal 100 million vaccines 100 days Trump set Biden easily walked in. gives public servants people outreach impressive ceiling try break through, rather clearing low bar. fined, denied tax breaks, denied access public everything, denied ability travel air form public transportation etc  really need replies like everyone says they’re vaccinated feeling better life? Like get it, people can’t get shot. feel them. continue masking since protects them. we’re aware people exist, don’t get sentiment constantly bombarded people vaccinated returning normal jackasses. know that. still prevents infection 95% time. helps free lot AZ doses parts world need right can't afford expensive stuff good far I'm concerned. but, read OANN piece said people survived better immune response COVID doesn’t matter. 

Why don’t scientists make something creates similar effect!! /s Thanks. feel better might infected household members. Unlikely covid vaccinated verify that? make volunteer medical information without violating HIPAA? I'm curious would work. thing stops spreading enough people immune. People get immunity getting vaccinated get infected. Vaccination slowed trickle. we're going people get infected, inevitably. Take interventions limit case growth? flattening curve, time really need cases flattened. stretch time takes end number infections. Unless think we're somehow going start getting ~half young adults gotten shot go get one, we're preventing infections we're delaying them. like spike protein could mutate anything   example, brother sister law said doctor told get shot THREE YEARS trying get pregnant (they pregnant yay!) fiancées doctor said that’s absolutely ridiculous amount time wait.

Given seen *any* data saying getting vaccinated complicates getting pregnant quite bit data saying opposite, mention real risks getting COVID pregnant, seems reprehensible. thing think doctor worried sort long-term effects babies might show seems highly unlikely since precedent vaccines. doctor can't produce data back recommendation would feel motivated find new doctor. headline bit sensationalist, would consider AstraZeneca vaccine still safe effective; I'm glad got moderna second shot (Canada, mixed) Personally think ""theater"". I'm sure help reduce covid spread amount. 

That said, seriously hope keep ""recommend"" rather bringing back mandate. maskless work last 2 weeks loving intend put back unless forced.  still one dose thought. One dose supposed offer around 60% protection lines they’re seeing still one dose thought. One dose supposed offer around 60% protection lines they’re aeeing Wow didn’t even think way - scientists work around clock busted ass give us lives back. Thanks pointing out. Counties vary size 10 million people (LA County, would larger 40 states) fewer 100 people. administered vaccines would much worse people think virus overblown. it’s sniffles media overblown political reasons. stance reinforced Facebook Fox News. spent year convincing won’t change now. like get shot, bullet kill you, halt oxigen flow brain it. Hence guns kill Fair point. Storage requirements are:

its still mutating; vaccine lower deaths overall, 30% still shockingly high amount (IMO) edging hard!! know CA get shot 12 up. think percentages counting 12-18. matter shots, Slovakia shots uptake slowed crawl. 37% current uptake.

In june 600K+first doses, July 250K~ wait list around 70k~ Maybe problem production distribution... mean countries develop many variants spread... keep adjusting vaccines? When's anybody knows? can't acces vehicle. 

But mean deaths (including deaths last year)

Or deahs since people chance vacinated?  Darwinism alive strong. first person work stop wearing mask one coworkers came end day said “I didn’t even think real thing, able look behind desk see smile actually make feel little better”. lost year lives scientists worked hard give lives back us. It’s time get vaccinated go live again. point collective ptsd. also understand someone cPTSD, let’s call is. long mutations keep getting mildy worse; moderna 2nd dose 79% effective delta vers 89% alpha, drop 50% worse anything but, always risk relating point tourism, of, EU countries open US travellers now. stark contrast, US maintains ban travellers Schengen zone UK place since March 2020. EU might taking things bit slowly cautiously, exactly say they're refusing 'get lives'. shit again. That's cute Yes, one high school teachers posted photo 14 year old son got second shot. driving car make/model sometimes brakes suddenly fail, would interested fact 97% time brakes don’t fail, 3% time do?

No vaccine 97% effective covid 19, bit stumped there.

Given still region 4-5 billion people covid vaccine all, Oxford/AZ vaccine still highly effective save shit loads lives.

It's much rich country privilege complain efficacy AZ/Oxford. easily surpassed internationally recognised standard 50% efficacy.

In India 1 5 vaccine all, let alone talking boosters ect. simply really access vaccine large quantities.

Besides antibodies everything, still protected without detectable antibodies. Time time oxford vaccine showed extremely effective protecting people hospitalisation death even delta variant. Los Angeles Times yesterday:

“A study based real-world data U.K. found two doses Pfizer vaccine 88% effective preventing COVID-19 result infection Delta variant. That’s notch 95% efficacy demonstrated clinical trials earlier, less transmissible strains.”

We NEVER promised full protection Covid. like odds reply made post smiling. 

*Do believe psychological benefits humans able see other’s full vaccinated faces?*

Maybe run around smiling everyone. curious benefits seeing faces. Sorry that’s insane you. Got first half, ngl Yes, 12 eligible considerably behind rest population timeline Biden gave goal specifically called 70% 18 least one shot July 4 way vaccines target spike protein guarantee thing variant widespread success among vaccinated individuals. 

We've already seen variants make vaccines less effective. much, far, current vaccines target specific locations spike protein mutations amino acids areas decrease ability antibodies bind neutralize virus.

I immunologist, see way guarantee variant can't evade current vaccines. Nah. They’re actively trying slow spread means. High population centers careful.

In terms science, might read well vaccines variants Thanks? flu"" like 😯 .... sickest I've ever been!!! 

No joke. That's huge part reason want get vaccinated. I'd much sicker, I'm sure I'd made it. then, make sense someone could die flu. Almost like wish people suffer.  Paying people get it.  wanted see state guess not. needs new doctor Yes actually no? countries? 


The country Europe surging cases &amp; daily deaths Russia. 


Russia set record high daily deaths 5 times week. Today 25k new cases, since beginning January. E.g. Hm, numbers much better AZ produced EU UK? can't imagine 92% protection hospitalization (as seen UK two doses AZ) 16% detectable antibodies two doses. UK even used 5 million Covishield doses far I'm aware.

Covishield AZ, made India. got first shot, craving cow brains lemon juice. 😂 actually eat sandwich.

I guess re-watch zombie. think thought fallacy lot people have. hear stories “Pharma douche.” one owned rights cheap life saving drug increased price ridiculous levels profit. People hear stories lump together pharmaceutical companies. 

They take evidence story, experience drugs seemed way priced, make assumptions. don’t reason it. may realize pharma companies kinda screwed limited patent rights. spending. 100s millions dollars develop drug, make money back less 10 years. patent 20 years clock starts application. clinical trials development.

Then confirmation bias. dad wants believe virus overblown drug companies trying make big profit. That’s lot less scary idea life threatening disease prevented something apprehensive about. Thanks article ‘Safe’ relative Hahaha, bold move saying here, love People stuck near homes since March, let live without restrictions. CDC state guidelines broken. Vegas back. comment replied originally talking Alpha may led confusion. No, aren’t. guess so, managed get flair myself. There's probably different way mobile, know moment jesus, forgot one, get watching new shows Histroy Channel.... ""a poll found Russians believe government’s tally coronavirus cases: Half believe tally thought high, half thought low""

So basically Russians trust government mean clueless. approach propose? Poland, unvaccinated people started receiving calls Ministry Health, change much. People ignoring them. Oh good. worried Las Vegas. also apply people chance get vaccinated cannot get vaccine? Welcome. already joined, want flair well. would’ve cool article listed twenty states. Canada got first may.
I'm chomping bit second right now. least require masks Casinos. many signs near Casino entrances say vaccinated take mask. Vegas insanely pact past weeks.  government, rightly think, realised even 200k infections day would healthy system collapse vulnerable fully vaccinated. 

As policy seems herd immunity 2 electric boogaloo, time ones aimed catching 18s. Sensible. illogical ones refuse safeguard public health well functioning economy getting vaccine. entire world went lock down, billions begging vaccine around world less fortunate countries, somehow society must respect wishes every science denier wants plunge us back horror? must stop. going away without massive vaccination effort, Australia starting plan. pretty much guarantee getting much worse gets better. Lockdowns slow down, prevent it.  Yes, approach need use “get vaccinated lose job.” Employers legally require it. People seem largely give fuck kids. 
So blood problems Instead voting, going reason you. First, USA, people work will, employers require vaccinations. employers trying bride employees get vaccinated. employers, like Pillow guy, believe virus vaccines unlikely so.

Your suggestion landlords banks non-starter. Housing banking necessary components working society. Vaccinated family members going let non-vaccinated members live streets unless dysfunctional family. Also gathering unvaccinated together one place make easier variants spread mutate. that’s without mentioning ethical problems solution.

Also something mention, people avoiding ignorance misinformation come misinformation own. victims listening wrong people. Prior internet, Information could controlled verified publishing. Even sensationalism news. anybody smartphone app post “information”, bad actors influence large groups people. Since confirmation bias, getting people change formed opinion difficult. example Trump followers. Initially Trump said virus hoax wasn’t dangerous downplayed vaccines (while time taking credit them). result followers adopted views. year later first announced virus hoax, family gotten vaccinated. convince followers get vaccinated? not. would think person’s actions “speak louder words” apparently case. Despite Trump vaccinated, followers continue remain unvaccinated whole.

IMHO, one problem many people trust government, often good reason.
If populace cannot trust government, less likely trust government approved vaccines—IMHO. mean, UK case numbers, sure put anything Covid transmissible. top fact highest vaccination figures world, alongside US countries. story uncommon weeks &amp; months come. Canada top doses per capita produce any. Healthcare workers got second doses months ago. 

Vaccines available premium price, NZ Australia refused thought covid zero possible. flat states District Columbia met President Joe Biden's Fourth July goal vaccinating 70% adults least one dose COVID-19 vaccine, according tracking New York Times. Puerto Rico Guam also met goal. 
California, Illinois, New York met goal. Vermont remains national leader vaccination. 
Fourteen states vaccinated 60% 65% adults, including Florida Texas, 16 states 60%. Mississippi lowest vaccination rate country, 46%. Almost states South 60%. 
The Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) COVID Data Tracker shows 382,283,990 COVID-19 vaccine doses delivered United States 328,152,304 administered, 155,884,601 Americans fully vaccinated (66.7% adults received least one dose vaccine).  Facts. also much less genomic sequencing. quoting exactly post me, got auto-modded one didn't? confused even underreported. 


E.g. Article NY times April. Russia reported 57000 covid deaths 2020, period reported excess death 362000.

Testing done free public healthcare facilities. vaccines free. People choose take private Covid tests want it’s required. 

A doctor former Minister Health. It’s shame isn’t vaccine available prevent this. Seriously Australia, screwed USA, vaccinated 6 times population Australia last 6 months. hell going there? ACTUALLY stayed home, exceptions matter financial cost deathtoll, two weeks, year half ago … Oh shit What's lockdown? lockdowns basically part USA... no... science figure sunlight kills water droplets... water droplets needed carry covid viruses... yeah sunlight evaporate little droplets water pretty instantly already know touch give virus would sneeze someone's face directly get virus one doing.... already know every event outside spreading virus matter masks not.. Wind pushes droplets sunlight kills pretty instantly.. 

Don't know linking post sunscreen covid cause anything other... damn near 100% effective metric matters, severe illness death. 

I still wearing mask, draw line sand self righteous asses pontificating whether ""doing part"" BS. take took virus seriously, that's it, draw line right there. accepted self righteous people going people stores berating wearing mask dangerous virus immunity, even though pro mask comfortable forcing people anything. 

Support attitude ends though. People getting high horse tell shit. I'll wear mask, probably, won't. parties, not. discretion. situation different summer. Right Western Europe 60% vaccinated (35% fully), end September countries might reach 80% fully vaccinated hesitancy low enough. effect added vaccination stronger seasonal effect. Actually seasonal effect strong many people Europe believe. main reason cases low summer last year fact countries severe lockdowns brought cases low levels. think fourth wave starts might peak August many European countries, maybe actually improve September.  read ""unvaccinated risk evolution"" irony is.... look world “normal” means. country literally millions **choosing** get vaccinated. So...... wearing masks? people don’t want make sacrifices (as see it: taking risk) live society, shouldn’t get benefits (herd immunity) living society.

It feels wrong, turn dial notches, anyone potentially infected poses clear acute danger others, would excommunicate death-camp like we’ve done past.

Not able travel people can’t trust won’t infect seems utterly reasonable. Ok follow science CDC got it.. Cause video says follow CDC American group rather world organization... politics... Idiot. follow science unlike you. vaccine rate slowed precipitously. small children disabled able get vaccinated? least say matter, vulnerable. Anyone says dont want get vacced due personal choice, hear ""I dont care make kids disabled people sick die."" need basic empathy: ""How would make feel shoes?""  seems like good thing write internet, Berlin. let them?

FTFY. think fair say Europe exporting much. Last time checked, 200 million doses exported EU countries world top doses delivered EU countries. since Australian government failed secure enough doses early (other AZ), unfortunately wait companies fulfilled earlier commitments send extra doses Australia. Hopefully, see increase supply soon. Sounds white. mean right. Legit enough drive mad talking anti vaxxer. parents anti Covid vaxx recently realized stupid fuck got jabs. There’s still hope! 2/3 world shots. ""Some experts say Russia vastly under-reports coronavirus fatalities""

How need experts say this? huge excess death shown monthly statistics released Russia, need much expert see nearly triples ""confirmed"" corona deaths.    feel you. 

My father actually got shots actively going around telling people vaccine hoax got since mandatory travel places.

Nothing say convince damaging attitude is.

In addition drowning lungs, Covid makes blood coagulate irregularly, he's blood thinners, blood thinners causing internal bleeding make hard ECMO machine work.

Hospitalizion within 11 days, even close, really data either way. really data day exposure, nobody ever done so. 

Everyone seems assume vaccine effect disease progression. seems likely. nursing home workers

Already shortage [People sub nearly month claiming easy get appointment necessarily say corrupt 

Just grossly incompetent 

With resources available (and financially Australia very, well off) can't make sure vaccines purchased 

Apparently ScoMo government can't something simple 

Why ScoMo prime minister? late, already got first jab within weeks start create certain level immunity.

Also, let go would still extremely nasty outbreaks smallpox measles seen anywhere close surroundings thanks vaccines family (made 3 middle age sisters,2 family-not me)managed get vaccination appointment including nephew who's college mass vaccination.We're lucky side.

Except for

A niece government worker.Her parents expect office workplace vaccination,as mother get vaccinated office,which government office nearby city.
BIL get workplace vaccination office too.We expect one government office workplace vaccination nearby government office not.

This mess.Hoping everybody get mess safely. I'm done worrying stupidity.

at point vaccine mean two things. Freedom live without worrying pretty nasty virus, freedom shit without pulling teeth get done. that, anti-vaxxers shooting feet. 

If anything Americans good doing, putting barriers access something sake protecting american soil, suing crap other.

Biggest example think air flight. americans, pandemic could effectively absolute biggest effective weapon, top tier vaccine plenty it. rest world, namely India, pandemic getting worse, sense, ain't over. order american fly part world, come back HOME, screening protect america spreading covid parts world definetly done. vaccine, amount teeth gotta pull prove safe enter american soil probably cut 90%. 

Why? Liability. airport responsible letting outbreak america unchecked, grounds claims losses. know pandemic hit EVERYTHING hard, things least move SLOWER. means less productivity, means less profit, means loss. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing think of, may may happen, loss job opportunity. Imagine recent grad 2021, went prestigious school worked ass getting good grades sincerely knowing studies inside out, wants change world ton ambition. He's also 23-24 years old he's even hungry life. gets interview Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Boeing, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Blackstone, Delta, even position White House, whatever may apply industry. BUT..................he's staunch anti-vaxxer. office work becomes norm again, would surprised offices start kind check vaccination sake keeping company liable covid related loss. that, company finds vaccination = ""not gonna get it"" (because fucking nov 2021 ain't gonna get vaccine America point, probably ain't getting ever), go ""sorry sir, resume fantastic qualify everything we've ever looked for, fit office, good luck"".

&amp;#x200B;

Press F used conspiracy theory destroy “conspiracy theory”! nothing believe. direct consequence (in)action. think conservative estimate follow medical costs tens billions. Age 6 months older mixed feelings masking. 

I currently fully vaccinated unlikely suffer major negative effects infection. also live county less 40% eligible people vaccinated. 

Being vaccinated also means could infected, asymptomatic, spread people. Including politically motivated unvaccinated idiots around me. wearing mask means accidentally kill someone I'm it. 

However masking live also means wearing political opinions openly makes target. Even height allegedly mandatory masks people wore targets harassment. lot local social pressure go without mask. 

So real debate risks &amp; benefits masking. already taco Tuesday NYC larger black popular Philly. Black populations major cities least vaccinated urban demographic.   Hey! Get back work finish grind Colorado Oregon! don’t round here!  I'm UK, vaccinated waiting US open blow savings holiday. somewhere else fun opens earlier I'll go instead, I'm sure many others government mess. paid extra get bunch pfizer vaccines early, half government decided simply stop paying shipments stopped. time vaccinating anyone. they've started first Good points. Basically happening.

The UK [vaccinating higher vaccination rates amongst vulnerable, [more people fully [more people least partially US.

Because longer pause doses [more people still partially given moment thus higher % deaths vaccinated US.

But important zoom statistics. means UK significantly [less admissions occupancy US.

And course add UK records deaths reporting [all deaths within 28 days since positive corona means report deaths less accurately (meaning counting deaths people died due corona) closer ""reality"" (difference counted deaths excess mortality/death certificates smaller). 

Now, reason [the UK fairing badly terms [hit delta wave UK EU US look like coming weeks months. Another reason almost young people fully vaccinated environment almost restrictions extremely contagious variant. always young people first group start wave infected group, luckily far least vulnerable group (the ones vulnerable age group already vaccinated). probably also means delta wave US happen later probably lower terms infections UK. level deaths people hospital/ICU many many times higher relative UK.  Maybe there’s rural urban divide? Regardless black people large cities almost universally least vaccinated. different big cities black belt? NYT link paywalled. Cause unfair broadly generalize anything, especially groups people. Nature may finally found way get rid idiots all?  lot sacrifices made going bar. 2020 absolutely miserable.   recent news especially republicans refusing get vaccinated really see problem this. Lemme guess: Mason Dixon line up? Oh emails showed upfront, honest, hard worker Fauci continues be. look up, absolutely nothing bad. least alone. Poland sure join It’s frustrating 12-15 vaccination rate shocking low imagine 2-11 year old rate even worse help herd immunity, either way, unfortunately, sometimes kill others along way Nah. help herd immunity either way fauci ever said something meaningful apart generic predictable statements?

Yes Still less 20 deaths per day UK Covid. number rises substantially I'll start worry. I'm saying me, much difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I'm glaring giving anyone stinkeye they're wearing mask. I'm saying indoors. like that, 200 children neither critical condition hospitalized. got referral specialized unit specifically long covid children. always horrible children fare ill. doesnt mean shouldnt open go facts science takes us. am, frank, really scared geting covid becoming ill externt put SSRI:s. Getting first dose vaccine done wonders mental health. also kids myself. Still, numbers doesnt seem add regards children.  Suit . true Moderna Pfizer vaccine, referring to? I’m sure two step shot distributed UK. single shot provides protection enough I’ve read.   Natural selection Also, ability treat covid patients improved dramatically since early part pandemic. understand reduce likelihood death covid hospitals. Lambda strain first detected Peru last December reached 27 countries, including UK identified six cases February 23 June 7. 

Only 6, worrying. We’ve also artificially constrained virus many places. Historically would run rampant like India beginning. Pandemics also long cycles many last 5 years. people see anymore stores wearing masks usually old folks look like may health problems. rural area hit 50% vaccinated would miracle virtually one wears mask public anymore.

The unvaxxed clearly playing fire, doubt that.  more, exactly, supposed do? vaccinated literal endgame shit get to? one interact with, thankfully, unvaccinated. Exactly, always excuse, ""oh, Covid killed them, 50 fat die anyways"" ""they died pneumonia used smoke teenager, Covid.""

I know people Florida lost multiple family members Covid still admitting Covid.  I’m sorry really stupid point, like believe majority deaths happened vaccines existed  7- day rolling average definitely risen. risen think, less, weekly reporting shenanigans. still hard say whether delta cases stably rising though; current level could described plateau. 

But we've definitely ended period cases steadily dropping, means need vaccinations avoid another fall surge among unvaccinated. That’s 4x higher death rate per capita (10m people LA county 37m Canada)

Even pretty stark difference! Imagine privileged shit think pandemic nothing prevent spread vaccinated. death rate outpaces birthrate. Otherwise newborns lower vaccination rate. miss literally first two words? Corona virus living rent free sub

Yikes go outside fauci pos  cognitive dissonance. coworker mine lost 5 family members last year within month large family gathering restaurant. far concerned, none really died Covid. died stroke, pneumonia diabetes. 

They died Covid. family members know died Covid. match personal world view, thus happen. People wearing masks whole time ridiculous say mask easy wearing shirt. 100 degrees outside I'm super muggy wearing mask incredibly uncomfortable. wore mask whole pandemic still wear one asked establishment personally I'm done now.  Take vote go really made chuckle dude That's ok. suspect folks believe vaccines, believe evolution, either.  difference even two hour drive make USA impressive. live, people still masking stores consistently it’s unusual see people choosing wear masks outside. 

Drive rural part state there’s barely one sight. Store employees maskless, bars crowded, etc. pandemic still going on. still is. emails released freedom information act, look See expert I'd believe you. since not, think claim needing thing missing (as not-an-expert) dubious. Correct. it’s scary disappointing control anymore. hospital gives vaccines free. Free. People ER come refuse tons stupid reasons. can’t force take it. know they’re problem can’t thing it. Denmark, pregnant nursing women can't get either finally age group month, still can't vaccinate wife since protection time birth, I'm still risk allowed birth child get infected. many people yet vaccinated lack vaccines special considerations. blatant disregard grammar proper sentence structure, certainly give away. Really? That's weird wrong. I'm willing alter life ways last 15 months possibility issues mentioned. I'm vaccinated, I'm living life instead miserable. Yeah, like instead    uncle one anti vaxxers learned hard way. every opportunity get vaccine recently passed away due complications covid. It’s tough lose loved one accept it. said, please get vaccine. Don’t stubborn. Nah, already reproduced.     I'm even mad it. Awwww, Saskatchewan... Kansas Canada! problem year ago number 100%.   isn’t quote genius. can’t take vax anyway several health issues also take immune suppressant pills kidneys thing called Steven Johnson syndrome messed parts body barely survived it. people might realize risk death trash collector 1/1111 annually. That's even different COVID risk, one considers risks year.

What kill makes stronger stupidest saying.  Yes! live Seattle take 3 hour trip Yakima get first shot back end April. Though able get second locally.  Sorry sorry Many people vaccinate fully trust vaccines. Especially many cases people dying received vaccine. (Mostly AZ blood clots) country?  thoughtfully written. Bravo… think either alot surprises 4 years. 1/1 million immunocompromised dying sure die spreading spreading even less viral load body spread it... Freedom!  get that. surprising Biden admin extended bans. China also banned whole time given low infection rates, def feels political. It’s 90% effective keeping catching COVID. It’s effective keeping dying. People catch COVID vaccine typically mild cases relatively speaking Survivors OG Covid level immunity newer variants concern get mRNA vaccine. Even recovered well get shots. Long haulers especially find relief ongoing symptoms vaccine.  antibody tests test neucleocapsid antibodies. Im saying miscalculation volume children long haulers evidenced study actually control group. Thats good thing though, meaning less children suffer post covid sequalae previously thought. far case. think lucked one. spike protein easy code vaccine for, vital covid worked.   unvaccinated man work kid hospital COVID continued come work without saying anything. 4 us ended getting it, even got even though I’m vaccinated. I’m quarantine, working home, cancel vacation Hawaii guy. wife hospital COVID well he’s pretty rough time it. I’m hoping anyone dies, it’s hard feel bad hope learn lesson. Oh christ dude. 200 karma, repeating yourself. think likely bot me, thousands comments across hundreds subs 10 year account. issue ban banning travel per sé, it’s blatant discrimination certain Europeans. Russian go US Norwegian not, infections 100s times higher Russia. Taco Tuesday everyday got taco trucks every corner! many cases folks target intentional disinformation campaigns. 

For we, nation, seem incapable holding responsible accountable *Disclaimer: writing comment realized I'm strictly thinking locally regarding herd immunity see state vaccine reports. original comment means that, regards herd immunity, state percent mean much (since much variation throughout state). measure many individuals protected, state percent obviously good measure.*

**RE: Herd Immunity** 
The 70% threshold used number typically hear reported herd immunity. city, would aim get 70% vaccinated. reach threshold, theory, much difficult virus spread 30% unvaccinated.

California [reporting vaccine per zip code area ([interactive map Looking zip codes data redacted (94% zip codes), 67.1% individuals statewide received least one dose vaccine (very close 70% threshold). administered evenly among state, would mean remaining 32.9% unvaccinated individuals moderate amount protection due herd immunity.

We break zip code see actually case. remaining 32.9% unvaccinated individuals, 38.9% live zip code reached 70% threshold. leaves 6.7 million unvaccinated individuals zip codes herd immunity reached; 1.5 million live zip codes 50% individuals received least one dose vaccine.

Looking unvaccinated individuals zip codes less 70% individuals least one dose vaccine, 20.1% California's population still risk getting covid.

*So original thinking first comment states reporting reached 70% (what typically think herd immunity), would mean state population relatively safe; even though large majority unvaccinated population still risk due spatial variation vaccine rates.* Yeah, that's think it. messed post. Sorry!

I seriously considered getting second Pfizer later, drive hour away appointments still scarce April, went scheduled. Still think postponement makes sense. wrong something? What’s stereotype? wish friends smart enough get vaccinated. Wish friends empathetic enough followed social distancing protocols wearing masks vaccine availability. Since don’t though opportunity reflect months stuck inside went partied realize don’t want friends bunch narcissistic assholes. 

I would recommend anybody else people like life. sucks first feel much better although little lonely. Good riddance them.

Had vent little:) time vice versa too.

Honestly restrictions never first place, since ended becoming prevalent anyway.  Well, guess got -\_(``√)_/- Lucky guy, arm diarrhoea.

Ah Darwinism working intended. standing blank checks parallel processes deliver next generation mRNA vaccines. still take long, one day fastest possible. better think larger dosage interval (8-12 weeks) rather delay/postponement.

Allowing circulate countries large numbers unvaccinated people accelerate selection variants evade infection vaccine-induced antibodies. Travel countries high rates vaccination (80-90%+)? real risk one infect. US, 50 percent fully vaccinated, countries? much. forget Americans visit Europe bring virus back much European would.

[Are confusing UK  Throughout whole pandemic Mexico wide open. US didn’t even require quarantine test return long time. Ever since last year tens thousands US tourists going weekends longer vacations Mexico flying straight back again.

The travel ban Europe seriously asinine. Seems like modification would quick easy - trials distribution would take time. Certainly ready streamline whole process. &amp; fiance meant getting married Las Vegas October. original plan UK cancelled last year we'd already booked honeymoon west coast. decided move wedding Vegas.

Theres 20 us travelling, everyone boat load money spend, double vaccinated, absolutely buzzing go waiting hear go not. Thanks, that's info looking for. knew second shots delayed know current situation. True. It’s bad unvaccinated variant producers. plenty people want vaccine around world deniers add variant problem. wasn’t study. deaths ending week June 25th. change data suit agenda like did. Anything bit karma Reddit eh? Thats issue based global unvax rate bc spread everywhere. need fund developing world want manage risk, originally started compromise vaccine availability getting many people possible first dose early possible. Since then, studies shown longer gap doses produces significantly stronger immune response especially older people making overall better strategy (provided measures kept vaccinations ongoing weeks delay getting risk groups fully vaccinated outweigh benefit).  Canada's prime minister got second dose july 2nd. wait line like rest us.  sure lump people talking entire subreddit made people criticizing unvaccinated unvaccinated literally could care less, lol. I’d actually trust official uk government figures proven liar son. Fauci laughing stock worldwide, one takes mug seriously anymore (preface: vaccinated, 100% support vaccinations think mandatory everyone capable safely taking them)

Covid never going away, going get weaker time regardless whether unvaccinated get vaccinated not. strains successful spreading ones weaker symptoms (more severe symptoms = infected less mobile/active = less spread).

If major deadly strain pops up, unvaccinated population become self-selecting time thin out, reducing ability spread strain.

Vaccine resistant viruses vaccine immune, going see covid strain completely bypasses current vaccines - vaccinated people always going less serious cases infected body least gameplan fighting infection off.

The likelihood strain largely fatal vaccinated absurdly low.

Is single credible medical expert fearing future vaccinated population? FUD something I've heard expressed anywhere except reddit comments.

We know also much crazier examples delta spreading they've seen, know delta gone negligible basically 100% cases UK short time - whilst rising dominance world, too.

How's that, everyone needs spend 15 minutes close contact get infected? Texan here, fully vaccinated.

Lets say 99% people vaccinated. let's say we're looking 100,000 people. Let's say 100 people die.

As expert transatlantic relations, watched closely President Biden took first official trip overseas, Europe — visit packed summits photo-ops sunrays beautiful spring. Mending relations Europe four years tensions, Biden gave life slogan “America back,” engaging allies long list exciting new initiatives.
Yet, great disappointment, many Europeans living United States, one much-anticipated announcement never came: lifting transatlantic “travel ban.” hopeful because, large, Europe reopened Americans. European Union member states — whose vaccination rates many places weeks behind United States — agreed lift ban nonessential travel America (although individual members free impose restrictions).
Despite high hopes contrary, however, America failed reciprocate. United States remains almost entirely sealed Europeans, result travel restrictions enacted presidential proclamation March 2020. (President Donald Trump briefly lifted leaving office, Biden reinstated immediately.) stipulate anyone physically present Britain, Ireland 26 European countries past 14 days forbidden entry United States. means thousands families, like mine, remain separated Atlantic Ocean, living state uncertainty beginning pandemic crisis.

There exceptions ban. U.S. citizens, green-card holders, spouses children, well diplomats, allowed entry United States. people — including students, journalists certain travelers working areas involving “critical infrastructure” “significant economic activity” — may qualify “National Interest Exception” travel ban. applications considered American consular offices abroad.
However, list exceptions leaves millions ordinary travelers, well hundreds thousands European expatriates who, like me, happen live temporarily America. nonimmigrant visa holders. live across country D.C., California, Michigan Georgia. researchers, NASA engineers, project managers elementary school teachers. employees, small-business owners start-up chief executives. children school, pay rent pay taxes. However, able visit home countries Europe since onset pandemic. Although allowed fly home, guarantee able return.

I last France March 2020 promote latest book. hurried back children D.C., worried imminent travel restrictions would keep us separated. leaving France, kissed dad goodbye lay hospital bed heart attack, anxious care would get pandemic starting. (He since recovered.) rushed back career home America, never imagining 15 months later, would still stuck here, subject travel ban.

Early pandemic, travel ban prudent move — case ban remained strong time. not, June 2021, situation resembling months ago. Centers Disease Control Prevention revised guidelines masking, U.S. government reconsider safety letting least Europeans enter country.
Over long, unsettling period, children turned 10 years old 6 years old — parents France missed birthdays. new baby niece born Belgium, yet hold her. grandpa turned 94, visited new retirement home. course, one lucky ones. imagine tragedy losing loved one without able attend funeral, pain suffering mental physical ailments without support network (I’ve healthy), anguish long separated child partner (my French husband stuck me).
Yes, fly home. problem, nonimmigrant visa holders, route back America — many us jobs, houses children’s schools — fraught complications. still possession valid visa try take what’s become known “long route” back America, involves making pit stop 14 days third country Turkey, North Macedonia, Colombia Mexico returning United States. detours costly unsafe. Coronavirus rates higher Turkey either France United States, example.

For need new visa, among them, additional complications. Going back Europe means stranded one obtains visa appointment. Yet wait times nonimmigrant visa appointments U.S. consulates European capitals reached unbelievable lengths: 349 days Paris, example. cities, including Rome Berlin, offering appointments “emergency” situations. partly consular officers busy processing National Interest Exception requests.
Given delays, European nonimmigrant visa holders told leave United States “unless understand may able reenter United States time.” backlogs effectively created permanent no-visa policy, radical interpretation immigration law State Department sued.
As nonimmigrant visa set expire soon, faced dilemma. could stay United States time comes visa appointment given renewal — April 2022. faced prospect 10 months separation, we’ve decided fly France finally reunite family, quarantine 15 days third country outside Europe (as yet undetermined) rushing back Washington visa expires. apply expedited process, hoping visa appointment would suddenly open, freeing family uncertainty. short, mess.

Although Biden administration expressed empathy Europeans want come United States, yet meaningfully address situation. far, response White House creation “expert working groups,” measure unlikely produce results short-term.

With eye coronavirus variants, Biden administration may decide hold full reopening Europe weeks, months. blanket travel ban nonimmigrant visa holders cruel outlived purpose. Allowing us travel would significantly raise public health risk United States. Sixteen months crisis, unable go back home become unbearable many Europeans. Travel tourism. It’s human lives, now, stuck unremitting bureaucratic purgatory. nobody seems bring discussing herd immunity?

Immunity vaccination probably lasts lot longer post infection immunity. bonus something count reach herd immunity. ""But 1% people vaccinated clearly work"" Pfizer? us vaccinated worry dangerous part unvaccinated still carriers/spreaders even realize it.  isn’t false.

DNA RNA replication messy process. Mutations happen regularly lifeforms Earth well viruses. Good luck raising much money think real data, sure multiple people get infected vaccination centres, hard id exact moment infection occurred even. 

But even assuming infection day vaccine, vaccine unlikely hamper, fact might help. cases vaccine helping fight infection post exposure. might get small dose virus multiplying time get dose vaccine designed ""LOOK ME, FIGHT ME"" warning immune system, vaccine going create antibodies useful right fighting virus lurking. they’re not, that’s entire point...  prevents million people dying , waiting vaccines, trust , approved.

Trials still conducted least source ongoing data. intriguing solution problem simple (just go get jabbed free) yet infuriatingly complex. politics, corruption, theories, master puppets... world globally change decade two feel it. know fore better worse change coming global scale. That's get new varriants, could potentially breakthrough current vaccines! Also humanitarian are. majority world even chance get jab.  week longitudinal study Switzerland, first kind, showed pretty conclusively kids don’t get long Covid. catch Covid, mild temporary symptoms turn lifelong debilitating complications. good 45% one dose, 39% fully vaxxed baby 🤪 False vaccinated people die first ~ literally science pharma works bring drugs. Basic science research (the groundwork understanding finding answers solving problems) done public funds. definitely done hundreds, thousands people contributing, paid public funds, whose work builds upon research paid public funds. translational research, development, clinical research often done public funds private companies. manufacturing done private companies.

(I work industry).  southern Europe really afford another summer without tourism?

Apparently easily tourists seem able deal able travel wish. entitlement want travel really high. Correct I'm wrong afaik asymptomatic transmission rare, vaccines extremily good preventing symptomatic covid, even still carrying virus unrelated issue? think general US getting closer breaking point covid leniency. employer point still dealing giving people two weeks test positive sending home large chunks workforce everytime possible exposure would running sympathy willingly unvaccinated would quickly turning rage. shocked see companies offering additional PTO infected ending program soon. 

Similarly customers losing patience companies running behind staff sick. naturally become obvious businesses much non vaccinated effect profit even turn over. think everyone burned picking slack coworkers sick/quarantined. rather disappointing around sure pill would come close effectively stop spread covid similar efficacy vaccines.

But recommended WHO, CDC, EMEA okay anyone pushing it.  gotten one yet get sick die that's you.

I can't imagine keep needing point unvaccinated people are, know, still people.   knew vaccines could prevent this. Fire goes everything burn gone too. COVID, trees able decide path take. trees dumb, however.   I'm kind surprised see Michigan. thought pretty well..

Apparently we're 62%.  Viral counts nasopharyngeal swabs children Covid-19 comparable adults. Maybe lower breath volume reduces shedding air, think they're pretty *ideal* carriers. Lower risk symptomatic disease, vaccine approval, frequent gatherings children numerous households, closer contact susceptible adults household relatives. Hang on, kind momentary contact ALWAYS possibility transmission variant? always outliers - individual case tell us anything.

In case, disputed least virologists e.g. doctor's office friday saw offering Moderna. sign still could 10 time (to avoid wasting doses thawed vial.) long since vaccinated, already knew state registry.  engaging children future — unless stop  …well, yeah.

**I demand truth!** people still listening hack? think point comes rural white people, response “fuck rednecks getting vaccine,” poor minorities, response “we need better outreach.”

The problem false information spread internet. it’s social media, email forwards major source disinformation since late 90’s. Europe US keeps buying vaccines, matter make vaccines. know might seem archetype you, people anti-vaxxers literal sense possible. think many countries Europe there's less vaccine hesistancy among older age groups also less supply vaccines. Hopefully supply continue increase. Right Spain, opened vaccines everybody still need make appointment.    people can't get vaccine. deserve die. person responded responding comment pointed out.  No, know people died, “pre-existing conditions” somehow doesn’t count.

Does anyone subreddit follow actual science, spend days jerking fear mongering scenarios.

Get vaccines countries don’t them, clearly scaring idiots getting shots isn’t working, stick science, conjecture  wrote before, waiting immune escape ability variant F490S L452Q mutations nothing new.

Someone care explain downvotes? sure? chance Australia going open border 2022. really going able watch rest world go back normal years do? think protection ADA? title bit misleading. They're actually comparing estimated blood clot deaths vs estimated covid deaths. yes, right covid many concerns besides deaths. Maybe blood clots issues too, I'm less familiar with. using surgical masks before, recently UK Infection Protection Control guidance recommended healthcare workers caring patients COVID-19 use fluid resistant surgical masks type IIR (FRSMs) respiratory protective equipment; think saying kids catch spread it, less likely ""vectors community spread,"" back many people could COVID spread people lived them.

As virus becomes transmissible (and people take fewer precautions) that's longer case, risk profile kids still seems same, thankfully. real. said, age-range changes depending Covid situation country. extreme example: live 3rd world country high Covid numbers, decent hospitals, ventillators, oxygen supplies, etc., even 20-year-old better getting vaccinated AZ.

There also political factors work. British government media cronies painted corner spending weeks weeks claiming reports blood clots kind sinister EU conspiracy aimed destabilising British vaccination programme (yes, Tories actually deranged). scientific evidence became undeniable, waited last moment act, even restricted 20-29 age-group, order save face. like saying: yes OK may problem, virtually nothing, barely affecting anybody, right along....

Having said that, immunity come vaccines, people previously infected also become immune original virus. idiots kill us blame communism.  Crucially, however, model showed introduction FFP3 respirators provided 100% protection direct, ward-based COVID-19 infection.

Oh yeah.

Given Australian Federal government seems determined hands possible COVID (No flaws make plan!) basically ordered Pfizer March 2021 theres ~300k doses week whole country moment.

From next week increase ~1m Pfizer doses week delivered third week July, set aside second doses vaccination rate probably still hover close 1m first doses week (with AZ reducing 60 YO finished).

This due continue till October weekly rate goes 2m Pfizer 1m Moderna (Projected). Pfizer/BioNTech *that* expensive Chile poor. Sinovac actually costs bit. guessing matter limited supply rather lack funds. wish every vaccine would require booster dose every half year. That’s much. assume individuals wearing masks? No. surprised checked found cohort-based. way reported, going 8 weeks. No. Masks weren’t required zero Covid.  Exactly. vast majority pandemic less way get western vaccines EU exports, demand EU exports high poorer countries likely outbid first place done encourage people get it. they’re risking obscene medical bills, impact share healthcare premiums. pay choice spread disease &amp; become infected?

This UK.

Deaths 

Rate per 100,000 people: 0.1

from 

There 18 deaths within 28 days positive test coronavirus reported 3 July 2021. 
Between 27 June 2021 3 July 2021, 118 deaths within 28 days positive coronavirus test. shows decrease -0.8% compared previous 7 days. best thing keep kids active healthy. They're low risk already, improve odds further. Oh no.

Anyway.

(this comment applies US refuse vaccinated) I’m sorry loss. read different news article genetic sequencing determined one infect other. second dose yet, masks effective people wearing it.

Furthermore variant wildly control UK Delta. Alpha variant others died replaced Delta. Delta variant bad news people single shot. Singapore trace studies basically gold standard. dealing mostly delta variant now. Well , show vaccinated person tested positive without symptoms spread another person. that's good. However, vaccinated person symptoms spreads easily unvaccinated person symptoms. bottom line, vaccinated not, person experiencing symptoms spread someone else. link information requested too, Singapore data amazing So? distinction matter? bad them. Sad families. problem. Wayback machine important. Donate continued service. Exactly! antivaxers know think evolution isn’t real vaccine AZ one used UK, different name. delta abundance seem fine age groups addition Covisheild one here. Shocking Vaxzevria product name Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. Covishield product name vaccine doses manufactured India. Uh, course do. get flu shots every year, not? Maybe really comes making people give shit someone themselves. Back mattered, antisocial behavior got exiled left dead. Now, antisocial assholes running things convincing people beliefs important peoples lives. can't assed care others, anyone give shit say? 1. Would need worldwide, comes somewhere else after.

2. end two weeks, would still need fantastic testing infrastructure catch outliers, and

3. isolate people starting disease progress catching contagious family members locked (or care home prison boarding-school cohabitors)

Four weeks would way successful, but

4. people can't eat tonight work today. massive food programs billions folks would apply to.... Oh, plus

5. farmers truck drivers meat processing workers still need work need millions people stay home work rigid masking testing rules everyone needs learn...

In conclusion: pretty poor job putting brakes thing. 100% successful version way harder people normally give credit to. strange attitude explained post. type ""doing part""? hell ""people (myself)""? projecting point.


I said two simple things. public, reasonable still wear mask. group vaccinated friends and/or family, reasonable enjoy like I'll wear mask, probably, won't. parties, not. discretion.

If there's mask mandate, wear mask, fined so. there's large gatherings mandate, parties, fined so. much discretion. Additionally, regardless mandates, still talk reasonable whether state tells not. mean, hit head wall like, illegal, probably advisable right? prevent infection ...when recognize that? Yeah mostly choice I'm fussed. involved fleeting encounter vaccinated?  Well law here, least Germany champing bit Australia far place behind AstraZeneca delays could mention country state... constant stress trauma also make people irritable impatient (well beyond forgetting manners). We're going lot deal coming years. think fine tuning dose mostly; like tilling mg body mass adults degree; generaly safe far Besides total fear mongering cttv doesn’t prove virus passed one other.  know previously infected FYI comment posted 4 times heavily downvoted, might want delete 3 honestly could take loss smell... need avoid foods.... Let's face it, white 30 year old man got first FDA-approved vaccine Biden even spit parents virtual school little brother (9) one semester since fully vaccinated second semester, there's way we're letting go elementary public school Florida unvaccinated kids.  People get fined smoking weed public? Lol time cops get joint long gone that's want do, what's you?  virus going ever-present

This statement very, loaded. know vaccinated people spread virus... reason allowed whatever want fully vaccinated..

Having smaller viral load system means going spread even smaller viral load that's basically amount would use old vaccines... yeah basically spreading vaccines breath get sick. Getting vaccine approved children needs huge priority  know know deadlier flu, ever care tens thousands dying flu every year? Sadly, always vulnerable people susceptible losing battle virus. necessarily people care, gonna 0 risk. amount people already vaccinated deaths decreased already. I'm really looking forward anti vaxers blaming vaccinated causing mutations.... ""If oNe GoT vAcCiNaTeD wOuLd hEaRd ImMuNiTy NoW!!!!"" Cases exploding UK, Portugal Spain. end next week also look France Netherlands. normal death count non covid year? dumbest article... ""I wanted see state at, badly enough 5 second google search.""

I agree overall point included list, though. you’ve two vaccinations, wearing mask, really risk? long going cut social events life? 5 years? 10 years? Forever ? earth still isolating fully vaccinated? course go back normal life, thats whole point. ""the new normal"", one 2019 comment reply what’s false narrative somebody preventing anybody making choice?

Not sure think I’m disagreeing. 

People complaining forced something literally choosing to. 

While rest world struggling get vaccines want need. gets even scarier realize countries kind people active Ministers Health. killed shit grandma age. Burnt lungs even breath O2. Then, eaten days, decision made give opiates take O2. scheduled get shot week tested positive, dead 3 diagnosis.

*Fuck* mindset people like dad profit propaganda! IMO never lifted huge disservice CDC rushed forth. Exactly point hard enough get people put first place even consider putting back may stress even went along without batting eye previously.

Even people went got vaccinated think means immune. wonder many infections going unreported simple fact vaccinated people think immune write something else.? know house hold vaccinated wife belief right someone gym came ""just little cold"" day 4 symptomatic dozens people knows. infringing people's bodily autonomy right informed consent? I’m going..I’m taking me! Hahaha!!! two-three weeks around 30% protected symptomatic covid, likely much higher severe disease. Two weeks secons shot percentage increase 90%.

Those numbers delta variant  ""literally millons"" wrong. first time.


You wrong want long affects you. starts affecting others even indirectly, society step in. reason people wear seat belts. thought covishield product name, Astra Zeneca company selection pressure increase people vaccinated ongoing pandemic might filter mutations evade vaccine immunity together reset us early 2020. 

Evolution filters nothing play with, evolution viruses another level... risk... Masks prevent spreading it. Vaccines prevent hospitalized hopefully.  slow vaccinating 12 16 years old? vaccinating fast vaccinated adults would take week! exposed high enough viral load catch covid, better chance hospitalized. Plenty vaccinated people caught covid multiple times afterwards luckily got fluish lost sense smell. Vaccines work! hope Portugal starts looking hospitalizations rather cases. really want visit August :) definitely need more, everyone's sake. Short answer: Yes. Long answer: read vaccine FAQ. Also, yes. hockey arena mass vaccination clinic son use model. wonder why? COVID Israel: Serious Cases Surge Delta Variant Advances

That ""scam"" he's referring name: capitalism.  OP, kids get yet. can’t get vaccine due medical conditions/allergies. countries (outside US), everyone access yet. 

However, another commenter pointed out, demographics really reading Economist. might seen similar articles widely read publications. thing US there's enough vaccine everybody long time. gets first, refusing get point.

Among unvaccinated, chances getting Delta variant next year quite high. Everything said wrong. mean yeah Alabama mess like usual. overall USA quite close goal hit soon. headline like people say “trump counties” without realizing nobody lives counties cry river local outbreak happening bumfuck county middle bumfuck nowhere maybe 300 people spread area size Seattle.

I see point, but...it's nearly serious say, actual outbreak happens like, actual Seattle got hundreds thousands potential vectors. 

State-wide metrics give good information covering second scenario quite well. nah theory wrong. rare quite common. Even known people got heart inflammation, one guy even reported local news. personally took moderna jab felt weak heart rate increased 3 days! thought taking second jab, afraid heart inflammation. think logical one jab, young enough antibodies fight virus. logical it? Hi. I'm anti-vax I'm personally anxious getting vaccine. I'm 29-year-old male really want covid vaccine I'm scared idea, maybe others boat. safe? think talking alpha delta. Quite terrible country excess vaccines available since mid-April. No, companies like biontech, pfizer, moderna made mrna tech viable. Furthermore, inventor mrna tech, Katalin Karikó, one ""pharma exces"" hate. 

This public-private partnership put us position access miraculous vaccines right needed them.

Cuba sharing vaccine now? west access mrna vaccine 6 months? Thanks I'm glad pfizer.  America's drugs manufactured India ingredients China including critical antibiotics. glass houses. positive antibody test would mean they’ve vaccinated disease. agree, important clear. stats Canada often reflecting first doses clear people poo-pooed anyway.

At point almost caught US second doses. next couple weeks likely hit 80% first shot/50% second shot, possibly higher second shots starting force now. talking simple claim ""fatalities vastly under-reported"", sort sophisticated data analysis. airport many kids ever 69.9 ;))) Someone good graphic skills ought draw map successful states adorned American flag mark day. disingenuous whatsoever. uses word “goal”, USA transparently 70 percent adults whole time say 84% antibodies? Bullshit sensationalist headline dumb headline. states include populous. Almost 68 percent adults overall!

We don’t really choice - COVID *will* evade vaccines reset vaccination effort zero don’t get community spread control.

The apparently widespread belief pandemic completely “over” vaccinated toxic incredibly dangerous.   “Less chance” actually means “a chance” means ones get likely evaded immune response trained vaccine.  No, anything virus outcompete immune systems vaccinated produce powerful variant—if ever powerful variant, doubtful. vaccinated ones enhanced immunity definition. Stop lying. Vaccines prevent infections antibiotics treat active infections. It’s thing. greatest risk new variants within active infections, virus replicating replication there’s chance adaptive mutation. they’re severe viruses it’ll like second flu well established while. countries restricted Astrazeneca vaccine older people only.

But thing mathematical numbers game age-boundaries shifting numbers used equation: lots Corona-cases country, specific mutations, risks virus higher risks vaccine, even 20s. case numbers country extremely low, even 45 year old vaccine might carry risk virus. 18-39 figure mentioned fixed: governments advisory bodies commonly adjusting advise based changing circumstances. 4 variants billions unvaccinated people?

These pretty inefficient factories stunning part Republicans aren’t pushing marketing vaccine. hunch, seems like overwhelming majority unvaccinated people right now—and hence likely die covid—are Republican voters.

Honestly point went disagreement Republicans seeing plainly evil. upper brass leading voters irredeemable evil acts squeeze votes unpopular elitist, ""conservative"" ideas, base cool need sort ego-boosting identity lives.

Don't care anymore, COVID killed family members tried minimized contact past year idiots keep telling people big deal, free. vaccinate can't get wrong were. earned ire.  Interesting. Thanks everyone. Brazil 83rd country world GDP per capita, value US$6,450 per inhabitant. country rich natural resources.” - wouldn’t call Brazil rich “most richest world” tbh I’m pretty sure point stands even found personally offensive. Flu viruses lot; example 2017-2018 particularly nasty variant started spreading rapidly. Pathogens evolve become milder means rule everything follow.

Sometimes viruses become lethal *and* infectious; mutation makes virus 2x lethal 2x contagious often still good tradeoff virus.  protect infection people. people though, protect severe infections.

The vaccine tells body create antibodies, problem immune system creates ton different kinds doesn’t know actually work. So, come contact someone infected COVID-19, possible get infected. hand, body might create perfect antibody kill COVID-19 ever chance infecting probably get chance spread someone else.

Everybody’s immune system works different though, people really fast acting aggressive immune system, others may slower immune system. good, it’s one attacks faster other. 

In conclusion, people end immune system completely annihilated Covid-19, people who’s immunity strong enough defend severe infection. Sadly, also people get immunity vaccine, sucks. people who’ve infected twice now? Hey Current River open float? due delta? Sure Ant America ignore simple things know end pandemic simultaneously complaining pandemic won’t seem end. study, published weekly edition Eurosurveillance journal, models four months vaccine distribution strategy France involving Vaxzevria (commonly called AstraZeneca) May 2021, concludes using vaccine entire adult population would avert 10 deaths Covid among 18-39-year-olds, would associated 21 deaths blood clotting age grouping time period.

This study already acknowledge everyone dying blood clots gets them. Still 21 deaths AZ vs. 10 averted deaths Covid among 18-39 years old France would used AZ entire adult population hypothetical model. makes use AZ age group questionable. Anyone wants vaccine US easily get one, sure understand logic. July 3 (Reuters) - South Africa hit record 26,000 fresh COVID-19 cases Saturday, second record-breaking tally many days, rampant third wave infections coursed largely unvaccinated population. rampant rise infections Africa's industrialised nation stretched health services breaking point, hospitals beds medics man them, forced government impose partial lockdown restrictions. tackle problem, South Africa Saturday approved China's Sinovac vaccine COVID-19, growing evidence emerges effectiveness. China. nations tryin make old style vaccines makes sense. believe certain home ruined socialization. People forgotten patient kind other. 

This definitely part it, too. People talk person like used talk online, something pretty terrible. Social media *objectively* bad society. knew last year, COVID came along turned 11.

I know we're going, somewhere good. want ""*person spreads negativity*,"" many things point society *improving*.

**Edit:** Automod like six-letter d-word pessimists. Context, guys. 🤷‍♂️ Mutations smart like that. happen chance viral code replicated. vaccinated person allows far fewer opportunities virus multiply thus fewer opportunities RNA mutate. see strain resistant vaccines, likely mutated unvaccinated person mutation making different enough get around vaccine immunity. 

Viruses can't really become resistant antibodies, antibodies recognize fast enough virus changed much (think annual flu needing new vaccine year exact reason). might thinking bacteria becoming resistant antibiotics, quite viruses. insisting they’d rather “thrown clear” accident.

That’s think happens? 

Did ever hear happening? don’t fucking care. calories either, I'm tied rest us. change fact. eat use, get fatter.  swear hear time, doom hysteria new variant could right around corner, render current vaccines null void, leaving us back square one. hear often, yet never hear actual evidence happening even happen? point, indication vaccines used US become ineffective anytime soon?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* last thing wrote incredibly important point. need emerged variant-specific boosters, countries produce mRNA jabs (almost universally wealthy nations) route finite production capacity covering citizens first. vaccine-resistant variant would mildly problematic wealthy world, nothing short disastrous developing world.  Needing read study understanding smiling human interaction beneficial insane take, yes. aren’t They’re steamrolling ahead 2nd shots general population already. got mine 1.5 weeks ago I'm sure that's people getting infected day Covid today year ago (on worldwide basis, U.S.A.) Can’t force people take vaccine.

Even someone fully vaccinated extremely pro vaccination don’t want forced vaccinations. don’t like precedent sets. people HI get second dose? significance/relation MNRA vaccines? really aren’t uncomfortable hot. live Texas. Intubation much worse. Ya it’s hard fix stupid makes point even meaningless. Congratulations! Awesome close states also fully vaccinated! One step closer end pandemic :) So, that's hard no. current mRNA vaccines designed like couple days (but built decades work).

Any update require small recipe tweaks handled existing production processes.

The FDA said boosters tested/approved way test/approve flu vaccine. short trial couple hundred people. major side effects show right vaccination (in vaccines, generally) safe thing do.

Tl;dr: yes, get “take credit things existing vaccines” Asking studies insane take? experience, people anti-lockdown least likely follow rules, causing lockdowns work. seriously doubt lockdown kills anywhere near many COVID does. US, suicides actually last year (A rise suicides kept seeing anti lockdown people warn of). 

What pisses people like sacrifice “lockdowns” many people ignored lived lives concern others, greatly prolonged pandemic. often people spread misinformation vaccines. also tend anti-mask, truly selfish dumbest stance. 

Rant over. vaccines might driving selection pressure, target specific antigens virus. Bret Weinstein talked extensively interested idea.  Mississippi busy believing evolution shooting foot. Sometimes can't fix stupid. way vaccines target spike protein guarantee thing variant widespread success among vaccinated individuals. pharmaceutical companies stated easy quick make tweaks vaccines make even effective. Makes sense, tbh well.......

i think pandemic 600,000 dead americans would make Trump get votes people mroe scared shutdown unchecked virus.... but.....

- ""A, therefore totally nothing worry about. Party on!"": opinion piece People shouldn’t worry virus mutating knew anything biology would know viruses don’t become deadly mutate, become infectious infectious ≠ deadly. see viruses want spread, good killing host can’t spread well. viruses naturally mutate become infectious less deadly. Never viruses mutated become deadly host. It’s less less people dying pandemic goes on. immune systems adjust virus becomes weaker. definitely get shot. variant going pick trick giving zero fucks vaccines targeting spike protein. spike protein way virus establish foothold person (though established foothold, look like might another trick infecting cells). Lord help us west…. 🥲  two month gap fine, UK think confused, vaccines produced pharma companies saving lives. Without pharmaceutical companies even close level vaccination now. Show example system that's working better. Wow insane take.  works 1 per 100,000 cases pfizer vaccine. serous. mean, probably truth say, also lot mitigating factors.

For one, lot old people immunocompromised people. Plus, mortality rate seems much driven age immune status. mortality rate really starts going around 60, it’s almost zero that. look mortality rates risk groups compared age matched controls, it’s surprisingly bad. hospitalisation ICU rates crazy high, seem able keep alive. kinda matches anecdotal experience; COVID surprisingly non-issue among chemo stem cell transplant patients. expecting disaster, never seemed materialize.

Finally, people might willing year isolation isn’t willing after… might hypocrisy, could people didn’t realize awful loneliness really is? mostly turn blind eye, something serious, can't prove, they'll instead. least that's theory. Weird downvoted, perfectly okay question

I think could find person got antibodies test antibodies uncomfortable, hot, can’t smile others hard speak people understand saying half time. worth mentioning US hit point basically anyone wanted get vaccinated able get process started roughly mid-May. following EU vaccine situation closely, believe recently gotten point still getting still amount time hitting point willing participants fully vaccinated. me, US resident likes seeing restrictions disappear, would make significant difference. point people getting seriously ill dying US almost exclusively people made choice take risk.

Go read vaccine trials yourself. need one take time post vaccines targeting spike protein, AKA way virus get foothold humans, basically chance evolving defeat current vaccines. better vaccines online long. think going pull HIV/AIDS totally stick immune system, dreaming. virus randomly picked trick. I’d go flashlight  Yeah, get people fully vaccinated still panicking. low chance getting Covid, even less chance getting bad. get kids relatives can't vaccinated reason take precautions around them, area literally one even talked Covid wore mask couple months now. 

I'm sure vaccinated, point I'm going stay inside take extra precautions unvaccinated people taking, *when living life normal anyway*.

If chose get vaccine end Covid them; I'm done trying everything protect unvaccinated people, give shit anyway. Maybe area I'm guess, basically two week period saw mask use go like 80% like 10%. one else wearing mask store, point wearing one I'm vaccinated anyway?

The comment says life knew 2019 gone, experience life back normal around since April May year. Like said before, one even talks Covid anymore around here, people sure hell taking precautions. also seen rise cases either guess we'll see happens delta variant couple months. Although even started killing people twice rate normal Covid think anyone would follow precautions around here. everyone's minds. I'll go ahead guess almost tourists think done limit spread disruption caused virus. really, single vaccine shot protects well hospitalization  OP means know it. Don’t expect contribute go-fund account either.  Georgia state emergency recently ended concerning COVID. never mask mandate stay home order lasted like month.

LoL countries vaccines could distribute countries...... get point, problem headlines relentless since vaccine rollout started. already know virus mutating significantly known like half year, know unvaccinated people risk, known since vaccines first existed.  Sounds exactly like Canada. started asking simple question, pragmatic reply governments' decisions regarding allowing countries make vaccines. 

I really concerned idealist's take what's wrong world, going whether private enterprise, government, combination two best response pandemic. Australia 910 deaths Covid, total think people rich? They’ll pay little, they’re burden society. Doesnt stronger host immunity = vaccinated?  please go smoke pot public places would set precedence enforce law well.

They already do.

I wonder intentionally enforced it. start seeing people getting fined it, might create public resentment authority make worse. that, R value would higher 20. follow wrote?

If reasoning barring unvaccinated people certain activities vaccination status nothing else, restrictions applied equally everyone unvaccinated.

I recently got first dose, btw. age group wait while. nearly well vaccines do. even remotely comparable. times 10000. virus replicates transmits. Much likely point transmission occurred encounter. 

Much likely person longer normal incubation period (can range 2 days 14 days onset symptoms) point transmission may asymptomatic mild symptoms resembling allergies common cold (which prevalent delta) perhaps would necessitated COVID test. need implement vaccine passports need now. many places falls public smoking. pay 50€ (or account already). Vaccines expected approved emergency use kids (?)-12 years old around September, school starts August.  mother 79 years old also UK percentages different USA. Delta aggressive chances original strain death age weight around 10% Okay.

I thought talking United States. You’re right, countries slower vaccination rollouts. Lol isn’t funny people actually believe crap write?? Absolutely bonkers. think necessary... I'm pretty sure mean ""spread lies."" Sometimes, people make mistakes. Immunocompromised people children 12. Exactly. Pretty useless, suppose. It’s even official letterhead type identifying features like passport number actual vaccine card. thought vaccines children least 12 years old? Virtually everyone recommended get vaccine, everyone access. I'm lucky enough live somewhat wealthy country good vaccination rate got first vaccination yesterday. 

Anyone lives country slower vaccine rollout I'm talking about.  Funny hermit nations like Australia New Zealand can’t open again. You’d surprised, vaccines aren’t entirely made US. BioNtech German company partnered Pfizer production. ingredients made Belgium. Well it’s bad idea shape facts based around peoples perception. doesn’t matter say antivaxxers, people bit skeptical able read things like weigh risks getting vaccinated getting vaccinated. shot getting shot anytime soon daughter asthmatic therefore cannot go back normal. even vaccinated infect her. Normal also bullshit. Oh okay fucking dumbass. might way AstraZeneca, case government probably lets pick different vaccine. kid *some* vaccine.   Diabetes becoming childhood epidemic, health consequences children far worse covid. Halloween dangerous children covid, incidentally another thing causes people wear masks. Yep, couldn’t agree more; done yet still pragmatic take precautions even vaccinated. look see name matches passport, else do? Though guess risk pretty low anti-vaxxer would want travel abroad anyway ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ AstraZeneca Serum-Institute-of-India two companies use Oxford vaccii unfer different names.

When SII began production, bought culturrs AstraZeneca started growing them. makes one same.

As vaccine manufacturing ability, SII world's biggest facility supplying multiple common vaccines 2/3rds world several years already. make vaccines highest standard regularly audited That's evolution works.

Mutations happen purpose (like virus noticing can't stay alive, starts mutating stay alive). They're random.

Edit: Also, evolutionary goals. Oh someone please think poor pharmaceutical companies Interesting, went Walmart DFW area 3 days ago nearly everyone wearing mask Yes.

All effort focused anti-vaxxers. prevention.

Somehow drew zero insights pandemic still seek destroy health defense - bacteria, **over half antibiotics (by volume) continue used livestock farming (predominantly profit - grow animals fatter faster)**

Phage therapy needs customized individually takes time loads medical staff - system would collapse next pandemic bacteria-based (btw, estimated bacterial pneumonia contributed heavily 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic)

tl;dr:      learnt nothing. science person nature

Clearly not. Ironic considering don’t believe evolution say nothing. stupid things. feel little piece paper would difficult verify prove even authentic. kind process check see information accurate correct? I’m sure would work… usually prevents infection too.  sure getting downvoted. everything right.

The unvaccinated compromise also vaccinated.  hope Portugal starts looking hospitalizations rather cases

They going time ICUs also. Lisbon ICUs 90% assigned limit, increases care surgeries need postponed, delayed. mostly fueled 30-50 age group hospital. guarantee even 100% vaccinated safe raging cases among really want visit August :)

Too soon. year normal travelling tourism. Also better take delta back home you. (and would nice variants stayed put).  source claims catches replicates immune system catches it. less likely. mucus membranes nose actually weak spots immune system general, reason respiratory viruses tend successful. That's said sometimes comes luck. Less likely mean never. one wore mask also goggles? kids kind immune disorder? dont mean pry rude.

Kids extremely safe virus even vaccinated. Like driving school far greater threat kinda safe. adults around (especially elderly) vaccinated risk Covid low considered background noise terms risks take everyday life living.  understanding Australia genetic sequencing contact tracing know exactly person infected other. Hopefully, vaccines drugs sniffles years. state ""Moderna Vaccine Effectiveness,"" though. ""Vaccine delta, data Public Health England indicate vaccines less effective preventing symptomatic disease compared alpha, especially one dose.

I'm assuming vaccines (mRNA otherwise), makes sense ""otherwise"" would less effective, told.

Furthermore, article states following ""4. vaccines better?"" clinical trials directly compared ability different vaccines protect original strain, let alone variants.

Again: seeing something end I'm not? Gotta add /j people know joking otherwise reddit savage. Unless meant case well....oof. Feels good live northeast south Gotta add /j people know joking otherwise reddit savage. Unless meant case well....oof. Keep telling think matter real probability. point, chances breakthrough infection severe enough cause hospitalization lower chance killed many things adjust lifestyle for. Car crashes, viruses, possibly even lightning strikes (I checked numbers that).

Covid always waiting kill someone, brain aneurysms, flu, drunk drivers, sober drivers, accidental drowning, falling stairs, etc, etc. covid 19 longer outlier among things kill you, longer treat like one. wow, evolution? sounds important Yeah, see evidence statistics say 'I personally decided right', always division thought.

Deciding reality isn't, actually, lead lot really stupid decisions made. prime minister vaccinated yet? put below, we're 2 doses 8 week gap.

At first surprised length time two shots knowing Brits makes sense, always mind gap. context, 94% portuguese 80s fully vaccinated, 67% 70-79 (100% got least one dose, might waiting 12 weeks AZ shots rushing fast possible). vaccination curves according age tall plateau steeply decreasing seems saving lives. catch disease one viron.  OK think getting little confused/off topic. 


Again ever talking nature evolutionary pressures viruses. 

Nobody's claiming Covid evolves rate flu viruses.  ignoratio elenchi. colds starting hit hard. 2 separate cases span 2 weeks. I'm 29 got J&amp;J. Sore arm, headache day. Vaccines new, put worse sh/t bodies every day without wincing. less GOP voters? Nothing. walk get one. I've friends trying travel US get vaccine due difficulty getting one countries. Really? impression kids, especially 12, likely get mild covid caught symptoms all. think much worried there, obviously kids youngest person family 12, looked all. Nobody talks it’s real efficient way boost numbers point. America, people still vaccinated either aren’t old enough, don’t want it. Cool. let’s give do! Bill gates microchip empowered vaccine  Right. recently heard virologist speculate we've likely seen worst terms virulence due mutation reason.

It'll still around, we'll constantly updating vaccine recommending everyone gets yearly (or however often necessary).

I’ve talking people lately, discussing vaccine. it, simply don’t know effects years now. seriously didn’t know tell them. help? don’t want make love vaccine, least consider everyone think wearing mask somehow make immune variants. Masks peoples' protection, own. vaxxed, wearing cloth surgical mask make difference likelihood catching variant. makes feel better, complete dumbasses every country. That's St\*p\*d game 🤷‍♂️ Aka remember brief period time allows back narrative, instead adjusting narrative like message adjusted information. exponentially safer getting covid itself... that's me.

I’ve read letter, far know yet made public. Anyone experience getting Johnson &amp; Johnson earlier year recently getting Pfizer booster?

Wife got J&amp;J March she’s seriously considering getting Pfizer shot. Body hurts bit arm fever, small headache, else fine. key question whether variant increase % breakthrough infections. need watch Israel closely, since they've vaccinated population Pfizer leading edge Delta's push India. According reports 50% new covid cases breakthrough infections fully vaccinated ppl there. want watch see cases stabilize there's surge hospitalizations. thought general thought 2 shots great, 1 shot still offers like 75% protection. one knows benefits risks mixing getting extra doses. saying 1 100 people die virus already vaccinated? Talking America. Let die. Max last till end year vaccinated. compare US Europe  go? go? 50% ceiling TX. Excuses range political opposition “what want get pregnant later life”. fav “it’s FDA cleared” Lol. fuck compare flu covid still think need take seriously. 

How 600k+ dead count tragedy reality? amazing folks try justify shit attitude towards pandemic. Yes live Berlin heard it’s easier here. However, also got first shot 2 weeks ago much earlier based read comment. Perhaps indeed impossible recently it’s certainty doable now. got appointment things changed last days. never said way before, talk now. true. OH NO! 

Anyway... Here's balanced discussion: short: proven, there's finally proper big trial happening Pfizer. 

Slightly sore arm first shot. Slightly sore arm second shot. morning second shot felt like someone punched arm night before. ie vaccination site tender sore touch. 

No side effects, even head ache. Worked standing work shifts last days since second dose problem. Father brothers same. Granted may genetic component virtually side effects Pfizer vaccine. 

However met customers convenience store complained bad side effects Pfizer either. asked bad side effects Pfizer, everyone far answered, ""Nah, sore arm"". I've feeling vast majority hear vocal minority side effects like headaches, fevers aches &amp; pains. Yeah, true parts Bavaria like June 30. people saying true Germany weeks months. live south Munich actively trying get appointment anywhere months zero success. got first shot days ago Impfzentrum registered back March. experience?  Wait, know campaign really going well Australia, still many health workers unvaccinated? Unbelievable honestly. under-40s. rest us still waiting second doses still 12 week basis (although rebook sooner want - don't, I'd rather maximum protection delayed 2nd dose). live Bavaria say true. live past (one week ago) Living rest lives mask ""normal"" means.

I understand Singapore basically whatever government asks you, assure case democratic countries.

In Israel example, indoor mask use mandated week ago, many people ignore many others wear mask mouth only, nose outside (this way effective all, much easier breath less hot). Interesting, may ask area from? friends Germany already appointments without cheating prio group. struggle quite bit generally possible (I thought) think simpler - lot people prepared sacrifice grandma everyone two, lot people put tangible view it. 

There's barely discussion media immunocompromised people well-protected vaccine (this first I'd heard it, parents fall category!) suspect basically 'well everyone's choice get not, either they're protected chose be'.

You're entirely wrong say selfish, basically pushed line 'this could well kill someone know love' 'I guess people die'. Anti vaccine people makes blood boil grinds gears end!!! Even trump vaccinated!!! (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ Sick sick irony Delta joke. hope developing countries get support get citizens vaccinated asap think reading general attitude accurate. Unclear vaccination progress fits EU still supply constrained. 

As idiomatic aside: one takes tack, tact (it’s sailing term) Obviously. we're talking virus specific error-correcting genetic code prevents lot mutation. Making nonsense stories flu-like ability change patently absurd. virus continue mutate, slowly randomly. changes aid it. will. idea going evade vaccine find way completely stick immune system baseless speculation fool would put serious money on. virus frankly already good spreading run humans infect waaaayy fanciful changes could even evolve. guess I've incorrectly assumed 70% assume sort immunity who've already caught it. good enough numbers know percentage across country know there's overlap vaccinated people combination would get us close needed be. less vaccinated

Then way, wrong Flu increasingly less deadly; 2019 particularly bad Flu year, plenty deaths.

I said modern strains less deadly 1918 strain descended, demonstrably true. Outside specific epidemics pandemics, myriad factors determine many people die given year seasonal flu completely irrelevant, related virus mutating become far virulent. Lets honest, reason didnt hit goal morons like boss think vaccine government conspiracy... Sure, that's really point. science also says outdoor mask mandate would reduce cases (outdoor transmission zero), would lockdowns travel restrictions.

The goal take utmost precaution - achieve reasonable level. Anything short full-blown lockdown compromise, policy ultimately judgment call.

I've slowly opening horror stories family went last 3 months. going since Easter, started opening 3 weeks ago tell grandmother died. 

Literally day coworker got vaccine, going details various studies released makes Delta variant strong still stronger vaccine. asked even vaccinated people still catching delta version covid spreading it, what's point? could say least stops dying. Oh way. US become popular version covid."" never told us would ask get vaccinated, ended saying ""this [other Indian friend] stop harassing it."" we're discussing. way, wrong Flu increasingly less deadly; 2019 particularly bad Flu year, plenty deaths.

But don’t let statistics get way good story eh. hope that's joke.  That's bad. hear you. feel way. Here’s comment wrote someone regarding people vaccinating still affect country therefore him:

“It matters. Unvaccinated folks solid % population mean can’t bring kids anywhere. don’t care kids can’t public, that’s fine, get that. Im asking sympathy.

It’s important “you” anyway means families like mine won’t vacationing, shopping, going eat.

That’s less support local businesses, less tips waiters, less dollars spent taxed kids aren’t going, whole family stays home.

128m plus households total US, 24% households children. That’s 31m households kids eighteen. say half families think vaccine makes safer (52% Americans least first dose). That’s 15.5m households favor, 15.5m against. Ballpark.

Say 15.5m households think vaccine positive thing, let’s say one ten families think unvaccinated population (48% Americans) pose threat children.

That translates one half million households won’t participating activities outside homes. 1.2% total number households US won’t spending like pre-covid.

I’ve rounding numbers, say assumptions far, far off. Say I’m much half.

That’s still .6% families, huge hard fought terms spending power. Economies fight claw every percent.” Pretty sure testen voor toegang tests included total number tests, positive ones counted. Otherwise would seen 200K testen voor toegang tests taken last weekend numbers. mean.

Unless kids get it.

Delta dangerous Lambda right? terms effective neutralizing antibodies are? thought Delta gives +/- 5 fold reduction neutralizing antibodies comparison alpha strain Lambda +/- 3 fold reduction. dominant variant feeling zero pressure exactly difficulty finding new victims. variants quickly finding losing end game musical chairs, getting shut immune humans already caught delta variant immunized. quickly reaching evolutionary dead-end. Meanwhile Delta feeling pressure. one stating always spreads like though, outlier probability curve care name. still happened. Lol funny SHOCKING (said one) objectively good enough. way we’ve done previously. We’ve eradicated nearly eradicated multiple diseases world vaccination. Small pox - gone. Polio - almost entirely gone. Etc etc Yikes, that's unfortunate.

There's probably good reason believe long covid would lessened maybe neutralized together unless breakthrough hospitalized case, stop tracking data like terrible   They’re great even Az completely decoupled deaths cases. point? go comparing mutation monster like Flu Covid. Covid specific genetic code prevents changing much. strain Covid yet every year brings new strain Flu. reason hear term ""variant"" instead strain. specific amount change required new strain exists Covid nowhere even within eyeshot wormhole enter universe becoming new strain. Yeah, again, long term solution.

You need vaccination - actual immunity - actually eradicate disease least achieve herd immunity.

New oral therapeutic drugs may awesome, certainly aren’t replacement vaccination. Oh, know one. 309 million vaccine doses administered, three people died due blood clots related one vaccines. know mitigating factors prevent tragedies like occurring.

They extremely safe effective.   begins…  god, pandemic would soo much harder without legal cannabis. Love ya Canada! &lt;3  vast majority population even without vaccine never going die . LA county high vaccinated county—which makes decision even idiotic Look Today’s segment meet press dr Fauci. Oral therapeutic drugs way. vaccinated, significantly reduced chance transmitting disease daughter. daughter vaccinated, 95% reduction risk getting infected. daughter vaccinated, risk severe disease even (96-99%) reduced, daughter young, risk severe disease already extremely low (at worst, 2.1 per 100,000).

If daughter large proportion surrounding population vaccinated, concerned demonstrates massive lack understanding statistics risk profiles. concerned daughter dying covid 19 vaccination, concerned ever taking car. somebody who’s vaccinated since January, it’s depressing see many preventable deaths point. know vaccinated people spread virus? heard do. still die possible spread? downvoted non controversial statement? Deaths decoupling cases case counts longer relevant. Look UK surely hope so, also afraid call day stop wearing mask. 
I heard one variant mutations spike circumvents antibodies :/

hope bad think be. people can't get vaccinated due medical reasons, sadly also harming people. 12s eligible yet. country Europe surging cases &amp; daily deaths Russia. ourworldindata.org


Uk, Portugal, Spain, Cyprus. sure Cyprus delta huge factor these. delta detected EU countries get ready. 

Daily deaths booming much Portugal (and presumably Spain) vaccination strictly ages high full vaccination rates elderly. cases booming ICUs hospital wards filling up. Portugal apparently 30-50 year old group. thats covid death mean people died solely shot reactions. Ive heard many stories oh well never know real numbers. joke post? people aren’t getting vaccine choose a-holes don’t see restrictions cause change mind. could see threat illness death potentially changing mind though.

And no, wouldn’t back square one. We’d probably get booster. It’s reach 70% threshold flu vaccine every year. immunity, don’t. virus changes every year vaccine. I'm recovering second moderna shot rn, got WORST fever long time. totally worth it! CDC guidelines broad. Nationwide. always allowed local communities respond specific need community. Buying time get 12s vaccinated important. second dose way pop-up Toronto. suffer still use critical medical supplies.  Except still use scarce expensive medical services hospitalized... way! I’m shocked /s I, personally, living it. vaxxed. 

Hopefully insurance rates go 25% population wants risk dying long-hauler somethingsomething. sure downvoted. goal 70% population fully vaccinated (higher delta). went 70% adults fully vaccinated 70% getting one dose.

And still even make that. Everything I'm seeing week says overwhelming majority milder cases due lower viral loads. I'm worried young children point. ate eligible get vaccine, refuse to. **** you! He’s trying sell pill sub he’s invested company’s stock. Seriously. I, personally, living it. vaxxed. 

Hopefully insurance rates go 25% population wants risk dying long-hauler somethingsomething.  need NVidia card accepted phenomenon e.g. seasonal flu see less virulent descendants 1918 pandemic. I'm sure coming story find ridiculous particularly convincing counterargument, go. answer looking for.... acting new variants going eat face off? Darwin Awards thinking rolling large group categories... What's seems missing discussions antivaxxers likely spread virus, increase probability vulnerable person could die COVID. thinking seeing bigger picture. Tell vaccinate 7 billion people. Thanks  Ivermectin working well. /s 70% estimated immunity level needed pre-Delta COVID.

Of course that's total population, adults. went 70% adults main approved group thought could get.

Fully immunized total population like 47%, abysmal. keeps mutating. continue long people keep spreading other.   tells focus giving vaccine free countries can’t afford rather wasting time trying get people don’t want take it.  prime minister, Xavier Bettel, admitted hospital testing positive Covid-19 last week, local media reported , citing statement office. Luxembourg’s first – Europe’s third – openly gay prime minister, Bettel played high-profile role summit amid strong criticism new law Hungary banning materials seen promoting homosexuality gender change schools. Bettel, former TV presenter strong advocate gay rights sometimes travels husband official state visits, reported made “very emotional” call EU action law, leaving “few dry eyes room”.  worry. idea keep spread vaccinated enough vacine induced herd immunity work without restrictions.

If vaccines effective enough prevent widespread transmission restrictions, likely due selection pressure vaccine evading variant arise, back square one - overwhelmed hospitals full lockdown. EU everyone wants fully vacinated (or even first time vacinated) yet increasing likelihood COVID virus evolving deadlier / transmissible strain. u may read already i'm reading right, 2nd dose moderna vaccine, doens't work 21% now. 11% alpha strain. 

life finding way, but....  I've three continents, including parts developing world. Try again. think is? mean knew day would come. It’s sad people family, loved ones cope fact longer reason ignorance. 45 year old mother 2 Kansas died left 2 kids worried “vaccine side effects” 2 kids live rest lives without mother…. what? Nothing. Basically every death forward preventable. It’s absolute tragedy. It’s true. 68% adults (teens included) received least one dose. goal manipulated easier achieve still missed! Yeah, sounds like 1%.

That said vast majority people individuals contract covid ahead initial shot technically vaccinated already sick. lot ignorant morons eastern Washington.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Welcome Instagram, fellow Senior Millennial!  Yeah like mild cold. that's second shot. First shot nothing except sore arm. big science stuff Well, need cars survive today’s world. don’t need Covid. Sure, ban car use vs. take measures control spread disease. think practical?  mask, social distancing, vaccine much ask?  Distancing take whole new meaning walk everywhere. news, water wet. Lowkey nice cause aussies bragging last couple months well theyre handeling it. Enjoy even months inside gents Criminals: ""We must harness new power!""

7/11 stores everywhere: 😰 Thats sufficiently vague point idea referring to, sure politicians weigh national interest party interest thsts bad. case measures influenced re-election financial interests. decided grandma's neighbor died due shot. proof alread made decision want to. 

Most developed world understands needs statistics reporting, especually country like united states. data gathered: far death toll 3. That's it. 

You course welcome disregard reality assuage bizarre emotional needs, risk article thread about. Good luck survival.  UK vaccinated 64% adults 2-shots 22% one shot, 86% total.

The reason vaccinated people make significant proportion dying simply make large proportion population.

Think way: vaccination programme went perfectly 100% people got vaccinated 100% Covid deaths would vaccinated people.   seriously think wearing mask places like shops public transport thing ""living inside 4 walls rest days""? minor inconveniences equal end-of-the-world scenarios, must live constant fear changes local bin collection schedule. Unvaccinated people part increase vaccination rate Actually urge look numbers again. signed NYT account. There's like 3 counties black belt vaccination rates 60% 12+ 18+. rest abysmal given rural, uneducated, white county. is! definitely scared, doctor, Covid last summer messing around it. still long term effects fatigue. uncles got Covid, driving granny bring groceries keep home. We’re TX, ya know…

But hey man, first shot kinda kicked ass too! jump started super painful period due couple weeks. definitely sympathize. feel fortunate bc 12 hrs in, fever, hung around 12 hrs felt fine (aside arm feeling smashed days couldnt lifted). I’m sure know this, drink lots water/electrolytes relax arm move around lot range motion after! dumb 1st arm tensed &amp; stretched across body (getting drive shot) confined problem. also affects:

\- children, agency matter

\- immunocompromised people

\- people cannot get vaccine actual medical reasons

\- everyone, every infection chance mutation, every mutation chance vaccines rendered useless

That's people fucking danger, can't stop trying make see reality. really hurting themselves, I'd you: cares, let 'em kill off. they're hurting many innocent people process. true. coronavirus far deadly seasonal flu. back seasonal flu thing, lots people weren’t concerned getting vaccinated felt weren’t risk. It’s hard extend mentality coronavirus understand many people don’t care. It’s innumerate part well functioning society officials knowing communicate dumb people.

Look Kentucky— they’re filled bunch brain dead, Trump voting, McConnell supporting morons, vaccination rate high, voters love Obamacare, that’s officials figured sell things people (in case Obamacare made new name)— that’s good governance, meeting people are.

Officials need better job meeting ppl are, guiding better places. statement gives great ammo unvaccinated. Congratulations, came full circle.  Hey everybody, I'm going splitting rearranging links categorized comments, I'll master comment gets posted every day.

HOWEVER, need help figuring categories useful. 

Definitely following:

1. vaccines work.

1. vaccines safe.

1. variants issue vaccines.

1. J&amp;J fine.

1. Mixing Vaccines fine.

1. vaccine better disease.

1. Fewer Symptoms = Less spread, vaccines help reduce spread.

1. Lab Origin Vs. Natural spillover.

 additional ones think cover, I'll do.  Lmao ""you're disregard grammar,"" classic  One third unvaccinated people US kids 12. men, women children, too! .0001 population too.  ""The vaccines protect people infection"" false protect 80-90% people it.

You die car crash wearing seatbelt, would say seatbelts protect dying car crash?  doesn’t make good clickbait headlines.  outbreaks Haredi arab areas. fact, many towns high vaccination rates. supposed people get vaccinated choice? fewer anti vaxxers good want worrying what's none business anyway. self righteous though  Honestly good waiting turn. know people might want leaders/representatives get vaccinated early show safe kinda irked seeing people jump others actually working essential jobs get vaccine  Yes no. Theres always going info wars type people. majority opinions forced take vaccine, make seem like taking away freedom. incredibly sad scary know catastrophic pandemic we'd doomed people feel like taking away rights. saw article cited UK government study made concerned thought, take vaccine. Turns website citied page 13-14 study info supposedly said people took vaccine greater chance die misconstrued data. like, oh thank God. people believe never double checked data lmao. study showed something like 50 deaths vaccinated vs 17 deaths unvaccinated people sample size like 90% vaccinated people. Right, government, basically owned corporations point, benefit much shutting economy down. really benefitted, usually ones help leave house. Everyone else got fucked hard. Fox News pockets corporations, everything could keep economy open point convinced viewers hoax.  BS going happen everywhere. much stupidity wishful thinking. Yes based sheer numbers still fill hospitals remove capacity treat previously survivable conditions. Covid make things people need hospitals go away.  actually true? track people died covid sequelae?  Sure, sure. comment bringing things April 2020? relevant today?  Tiger King wild!  conspiracy theory :'D bad. mom brave woman. can’t imagine going back second shot anaphylaxis reaction first. I’m sulking fact super shitty week; arm hurt days felt like flu. I’m still getting second age contingent comes up, don’t enthusiastic it. would, belief wrong immoral hurts many many innocent people. small percentage still enough fill hospitals reduce resources available treat people previously survivable conditions. Nothing sad it. saying UK government making numbers terms covid tests children? guess obtain loicence smoke outside...  hope you’re asking jest case someone else reading this: vaccines perfect. work cases always everyone. generally efficacy rate ideally around 90-95%, means pretty safe don’t go licking doorhandles. “dumb dumb”… yikes 2x AZ, looking back would preferred waiting bit Pfizer. time thought would shortages went could get. 

But absolutely got shit stick end it, first dose 39.5C temps, light headed like week, second dose first diarrhea described explosive, 37.9C temp fever pain left arm severe sleep without pain killers, got better day day, took like 5 days till could lift heavy without pain.

If 3rd dose go Pfizer can. pcr test still work. antibody test show positive either way. CDC estimates around 115 million covid infections US. Realistically much unvaccinated population left infect. must reason seeing surges Delta, likely alot unvaccinated population already level immunity previous infection, would reasonable answer infection numbers dropping relatively low vaccine uptake. Italy already done too.  


Living France, I'd say 40% people really getting vaccinated. 


If go 70s population France extrapolate rest population, we're looking 33% population refusing jab. 


They're talking making mandatory France healthcare workers. talking making mandatory people age 12.  


Interesting times ahead! words Bill Hicks:

*""HOORAY! WORLD GOT ONE MORON LIGHTER!""* Arm fever? often tempted start ranting social media, authoritarian government pushing antimask agenda reason, interferes AI tracking us facial recognition clearly obvious fact politicians viewpoint got right line vaccines ""fake"" virus etc etc dark bright side 2 kids likely follow mother anti-vax realize died die, die. Let (with exception folks legit medical exemptions).  reports 50% new covid cases breakthrough infections fully vaccinated ppl there.

This informative statement, information base rates. thing keep mind there's approximately 6 vaccinated adult every unvaccinated one. keep mind, vaccine efficacy 80% range.

Given effective vaccines proven be, *you actually want see cases among vaccinated unvaccinated means vaccinated almost everyone*. I'm fully vaccinated, manage get COVID-19, COVID-19 test able tell it, show false negative? brother telling would show false negative antibodies, something nature... really understand said.

And long one hypothetically contracts COVID-19 see have/had COVID-19? in, test would show negative instead positive? many weeks day first got symptoms?  like using talking points like May 2020, thanks dumb dumb. Totally needed see one Same. dad lives Florida seen two years. Planning visiting huge cross country road trip.

I've money burn while, ment brag. know I'm privileged way. I've saving long time buy house start family. I've booked anything aiming late spring 2022.

I'd like least know potential opening date start booking planning want tie money down. ban still place Christmas might forced go somewhere else. point hospitals automatically triage patients coming hangnails. 

“I see chart need intubated, really need bed someone stubbed toe kind hard.” ""sure, fire department might put fire out, cost? water damage? want stuff get wet."" Cool, still disease vectors *can’t* get vaccinated  patently false? vaccine reduces chance infection, zero.  post WSB know made shit market ? also Canadian something? pfizer 97%  I'm pretty sure we're okay skipping wedding. Clearly not. posted much wanted one trying deep dive personal lives. keep replying I'm officially blocking you.  problem literally solves itself. would die covid they're vaccinated? Reedit full morons like you. wonder all.robots. numbers indeed high enough justify continued mask mandates - article commenting right involves one set experts coming conclusion. come similar conclusion.

Also long covid different pneumonia. Long covid neural involvement is, right now, relatively poorly understood. know people risk others. know cases resolve vaccination others not. know likely certain variants others certain variants likely cause long covid kids. 

I really understand big deal, wearing masks indoors. hurt. widely available. We've already done year. three months make sure vaccine available enough people generate herd immunity? Even willing risk long covid kids, even willing ignore evidence suggesting hospitalization rate Delta double initial strain, worth risking insignificant probability thing going mutate hit herd immunity one variants might end even worse Delta? remember back march(?) various idiots told us quarantines travel bans/border closures made things worse, despite fact they've scientifically proven best practices combatting infectious diseases decades decades literally posted situation forum, asking questions discussing things whole point? think jumping upset know deep actually rational skip wedding fully vaccinated person.  willfuly unvaxed:

O well. 🤷‍♀️  could continue shark invested waters, high probability attacked, antivax saying something along lines natural body adapt eat organic food. lot doctors unvaxxed. Sad part people medically unable get vaccine gonna get killed mouth breathers :/   pretty low, but, hard kid kid know. cousin's 11 year old died Covid last year. 

He known health issues, but, ended bunch blood clots died essentially stroke caused Covid. respiratory symptoms mild. evidence pretty thin vaccinated people breakthrough infections going suffer long Covid. don’t think base policy super cautious approach, no. Policy usually based best current knowledge wonder it’s like chicken pox best get young Unvaccinated people create environment evolved virus.  Well…maybe let’s wait kids get vax. I’m cool lol Naw. Fuck 'em, gotten one yet get sick die that's you. Singapore's already pretty strict country (gum literally illegal there), think anyone traveling Singapore would care knowing that. metric? states changed reporting, skew daily case count (the state reported data isn’t reported day). rolling average pretty stable nationwide. Hospitalizations deaths also stable declining overall.

There probably areas US low vaccination rates experience fluctuations case counts, outbreaks occur easily. But, really analyze cases area occur rather apply data US whole. thanks vaccines, infection levels incredibly low across country. continue masking. hand, wrote times before, think parents want bring kids 'anywhere' might unvaccinated people really stay home even pandemic economies (and are) find way cope - money spent things. Because, newsflash, life dangerous keeping kids home best way keep alive, really healthy anyway.

I get people think twice letting kids ride bike, motorbike (!), car, extreme sports, drink alcohol, smoke, watch overweight, friends lakeside/seaside - terrified covid. opinion that's strange take safety priorities.

I know change mind like change mine. all, many obese people first line covid shots 'stay healthy' 'compromise healthcare system'. Yeah.  wouldn’t think food allergy would affect vaccination way vice versa. that’s you’re wrong kiddo shit 😲  America wide open. need go Russia, Venezuela covid hotspot 14 days access US. 

The current rules make sense all! 6 8 weeks long time lot people health ruined till even die. race, vacination delta. understand people *cannot vaccine?* Honestly, understand idea difficult. people anti-vaxxers. people allergic, compromised immune systems, otherwise cannot safely put vaccine body medical reasons.

These people whose existence keep point out, y'all seem think unvaccinated people anti-vaxxers. Swiss study control group. found given time, 10% even children could prove never COVID, still exhibited tiredness, coughing, various long Covid symptoms. wasn’t long covid, never covid. Kids cough.    California here. get pizza party? That’s science works. People make judgement best information time, change information becomes available. received information revised directions. people want selective believe in. people eat cow brains? judging curious, haven’t brains love lengua (beef tongue tacos) Yeah, also like coronavirus, people get hit harder flu. flu even higher asymptomatic rate. Oh sure. people can’t get vaxxed due allergies age (too young). idiot assholes, though, I’m sorry hurts feelings. sad way find incredibly well vaccines work. :( Nearly could chosen life. UK ahead Delta variant wave. Expect US European countries track similar UK next month delta becomes dominant variant. interesting see high UK peaks. think ship random island  Sadly, that’s true…and thing convince even don’t trust still Source? would anyone downvote this? trust him? get information? worry continue spread virus increase chance another mutation. One vaccine doesn’t cover. 

 you’re right. part people want go route. feel stop rest us getting back sense normality bit. Stop coming where? Masks peoples' protection, own.

This really true. told beginning try garner support mask wearing, wearing mask definitely protects wearer well. *you* sick, wearing mask *definitely* helps around well, yeah, protecting already sick. 

But *aren't infected* wearing mask demonstrable protection wearer vs. wearing mask. Never quite said that, no. Republicans don’t believe science won’t get vaccinated, thus putting lives risk, well, that’s one thing. children? children vaccinated unvaccinated Republicans risking lives innocent unvaccinated children choice. I'm sorry mean minimize suffering people like uncle. Deaths going lot rare, one going pretty horrible way go.

I know uncle hope recovers, jesus christ. Literally two minutes time could avoided this. feel lot sympathy people work two shifts access reliable transportation affordable health insurance, know still free without insurance roadblocks still making difficult find way shot. officer NCO going every opportunity plus lot arm twisting resisted still unvaccinated June.   Yes, nobody see similarity vaccine agent orange decades come  Yeah think idea 70% adults plus natural immunity would equal (or least approach) herd immunity. Pfizer approved 12+ though we’ve already crossed 180.6 million vaccinated including 12-17 year olds (70% adults 180.6 million people). 55% total population least partially vaccinated think definitely crossed 70% country immunity. Unfortunately doesn’t apply states lowest vaccination rates.  explanation UK would cases US, higher population less vaccinated? countries eased restrictions. Apparently, right UK, know yet they'll offer vaccines children. That's interesting. majority covid deaths unvaccinated

[LOL hear England, beginning pandemic heard great anecdote may may true. 

A masked person gets taxi, driver immediately hit's ""you believe covid thing you?"" Already sick loudmouth covidiots passenger replied ""no stop tracking facial recognition"". taxi driver immediately became silent facial expression suggested wondering could find mask fast possible. 0.0000000000000001 entire world. Six months weird many people see nothing. vaccine make totally immune infection, make infection lot less likely even Delta variant. prevent someone gets spreading it, often reduce viral load shedding they're less likely spread anyone gets probably get lower initial load lower chance severe case. Anything reduces number viral particles either replicating someone spreading people helps deaths, hospitalizations, spread.   wrong waiting long term results biggest scient expirement world ever apart of? understand hesitancy zero problems it. vaccines coming mrna based, I'm sure people trusting it. Wtf wrong that? ppl disgust me. point, would easier CA subsidize citizens states take over. grandpa (70s) thinks “liberals” implanted kill switch vaccines going begin mass extinction event… Stop coming then. US 630ish kids 12 died car accidents 2018, 326 kids 17 died covid. lol, yeah....I surprised huge difference May. 

Which means, accounting time get fully vaccinated get infected die, counting people first dose late February. dunno, quite lot nurses get vaccinated.   understand this. Like mentioned another comment, live perfect world relaxing mask guidelines restrictions, compounded already prominent numbers anti-maskers, masking effective anyway. lower rate masking, less effective tool restrict spread. lives! put everyone risk, older vaccinated people existing conditions less well equipped handle illness, vaccinated people could using hospital bed unvaccinated occupy due *their choice* everyone given breeding ground they've become variants. 

At point three billion shots administered may opinion holds weight whatsoever. I'm sick people conflating right opinion obligation qualify valid opinion. r/technicallythetruth California, Pfizer, Moderna J&amp;J available?  1% death vaccinated people? fck.. :)  one hand agree, hand
Some people can't get vaccinated people vulnerable people society try protect 'unvaccinated' spread to.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Yeah. know, perhaps others don't. Good repeat aware. Thanks! hear you, respect concerns lingering symptoms. 

My view life-altering events carry potential long term impact. Breaking leg playing Ultimate unlikely, you, there's decent chance form life long impact even heals. make risk calculus chance post-surgery symptoms, make chance break leg first place. 

For people fully vaccinated, chance experiencing form symptomatic case extremely low. chance case carries serious complications even lower. condemn anyone cautious. strange people's risk tolerances COVID often far lower daily activities without second thought. Good news Portugal Spain two vaccinated countries world six weeks now. small population 12 high willingness vaccinate.  numbers would much lower people given treatment instead sent home positive diagnosis treatment get worse.  amount unvaccinated people city scary. Yet opened one prove they're vaccinated. first question get store employees customers "" prove I'm vaccinated?"" say ""unfortunately no."" . first reopen Kroger said nope still wear masks unless vaccinated. bunch unvaccinated employees bitched saying masks mark single out. Kroger said worry proving it. Kroger trying good public image turning side whispering "" worry guys I'm serious"" vaccines very, good, ""99% deaths unvaccinated"" somewhat misleading statistic.

The accurate estimates I've seen Pfizer Moderna provide around 90%-97% protection death, J&amp;J somewhat lower (anywhere 60%-90%).

There reasons vaccinated people *generally* even safer, biggest one vaccinated people live areas high vaccination rates, means herd immunity. example: county, Santa Clara, CA, overall vaccination rate 73% current case rate around 1 per 100k per day. Gentry County, MO 33% vaccination rate case rate around 37 per 100k per day.

If vaccinated area low vaccination rates, still *much better off* unvaccinated, helping neighbors much -- they're getting vaccinated, they're helping *you*. mean there's plenty reasons people getting vax'ed sad see majority reddit lumps people narrow categories. disgusting perpetuate vax vs antivax hate narrative. zero respect people like everyone else site. I'm vaxed myself. I'm page. feel truly horrible want get vaccinated, cannot due health issues, get ill others chose vaccinated. I'm wishing harm, I'm also feeling sympathy. happen somewhere   Dead dead. 1% dead 99%. But, man, quite lead unvaccinated see traveling abroad again, I’m Canadian asked. really see business really. Medical conditions that's know yours. define risk we're willing take honestly take offense constantly drilling this. dare act like we're supposed paragliding bungee jumping something. need give every detail come justification. random person internet. happy people starting ask question. several studies trying answer question, although necessary. one shows 27-35% people MILD infection (no hospitalization) least one symptom 4 7 months initial infection. course *only* anosmia/ageusia, 10% fatigue. long COVID mainly fatigue, brain fog palpitations 11 months let tell worst experience life. We’ll see ever happens.  data patently false statement. Literally opposite vaccine intended do.

But stop parroting. Hm, yeah, searching around, guess need smart kinds nurses. Also smarter population gets average problem large number unvaccinated people infected could cause new strain COVID resistant vaccines develop follow news know spots political pressure overruled science. understand, haven’t able scientifically correlate blood clots vaccines directly. still might 0% mortality rate.  Yeah reddit care that, they're practically kill (lol) even mentioning vaccine comes ton unknown side effects. cousin got last month week later go ER bc period heavy, like heavy enough bed sheets blankets soaked. guilt trip anyone hesitant getting it. Vaccines take years released public. yet got one less year. I'm getting mine eventually I'm waiting, either feel comfortable forced to. risk fully vaccinated adults worse risk catching flu another virus wedding years ago? get still risk involved everything life see worth miss major event family.

I totally get skipping something like last year see situation now. March 2020 millions dead  According preliminary UK reports saw going Twitter, proportion deaths Long Covid roughly vaccinated unvaccinated cases.

So vaccine reduces chance death 90%, chance Long Covid also reduced 90%.  already even commented.  source that? mean many cases would agree greedy, case see money could motivation. costing allmost us lot money. country heavily criticizing, literally people think covid punishment gay state emergency abused curb rights queer community especially. Bettel caught virus something anti-measure/antivax bigots celebrate, even though entire theory wrong.

But make sure: lot anti-measure/antivax folks phobic community, anecdotal experience. “I know I?” hallmark true intellectual. Yep, point can't even bother care. effective vaccines wanna take risk dying, go it. got back.  last breath, anti-vaxxer says ""Pwned......dem......libs............"" \*death rattle\* post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Well apparently professional health officials considering totality evidence every detail concluded actual transmission. Given they're genome sequencing every case, got genome match, wild incidence virus practically zero point, person contracting virus contact contact whatever infection chain, I'm going believe expert opinion.

There Jul 1, MANDATES. Intended permanent, we'll see. 

I responding hesitant wants, others think, right thing, despite vaccinated. 

My answer vaccinated, living place zero mandates restrictions, want worry wannabe Nanny's think. 

I'll wear mask, also start traveling holding back etc. virus without mutations personal concern danger me. Full stop. 

Variants could change that, now. Kids used small amount covid, Delta that’s true.  Oh no!….anyway enough people got vaccine order fully stop COVID, unvaccinated well spread out; mostly communities Orthodox Jews Arabs, vastly increases likelihood outbreaks. Countries infrastructure distribute vaccines rapidly, well.

Some... Mostly first world, even parts europe canada great. Heck Mississippi great.

3rd world nations infrastructure all. think first world countries need start something nations breeding ground variants. Thank balls acting. 
I wish workplace could this. 
All saying “we highly recommend taking advantage available vaccines.”  feel we're different sides debate really, I'm way arguing this.

America abandoned welfare citizens long ago, plain day.

But original, simple statement stands. Eat use = get fat. 

We're arguing implementation stage paranoid unvaccinated. process  really depends state. Obviously, said applies states vaccines readily available least 8 weeks (so people actually chance get doses), exactly situation I'm from. Russian roulette virus prove what? it’s hoax? Government mind control? win vs. lose? seeing good risk reward ratio here. People cautious want selves. care? One way much negative other. ""glass half full half empty"" kind situation. Sorry meant vaccines It’s current anti-vax propaganda thats going around, meant convince people away getting vaccine.  primarily spreads people end hospital, pre-symptomatic phase first days onset symptoms (so still among people). 

Exactly become much widespread SARS-CoV-1 lethal yet killed less. matter becomes lethal, ventilator, ICU unit quarantined COVID ward ones perpetuating pandemic.

People stop infectious get hospital though - they're position spread disease. point taking people feet putting hospital stops disease transmitted. making point am. Transmission greatest symptomatic period coughs sneezes spread infection anything. think reasonably assume disease become virulent, disease would noticeable faster, spread disease would easier spot people would put hospital they're less likely spread disease. mall. virus spreads via aerosols, droplets. breathing air lot longer ten seconds actually walked past other. mutations kicked higher gear.

Wasn't what? late already sent back office (which bunch people...), nice thought? literal natural selection every sense word.
